Hadley Stern from Marinade Finance recently shared his thoughts, saying he’s tired of the constant hype around $100K and believes it’s time for Bitcoin to break past it for good. On the Milkroad podcast, Stern said tht this cycle could see Bitcoin climbing as high as $160,000 before eventually settling back around $120,000. While some see this as a conservative estimate, given other predictions ranging from $150K to $250K, and even extreme calls of $500K to $1 million, Stern believes it’s a realistic target. “I still think $160K would be an excellent top for this cycle,” he explained, pointing out that the market tends to get stuck at psychological price levels like $100,000, much like it did at $10,000 years ago. He also said that with growing institutional involvement, especially through Bitcoin ETFs and corporate buyers like MicroStrategy, there’s strong buying pressure in the market. Around 6% of Bitcoin’s total supply is now held by ETFs, which could help push prices higher. While he admits there’s always room for surprises and acknowledges some traders are betting on $200K or higher, Stern views his $160K target as a balanced estimate. Bitcoin Price Short-Term Prediction Bitcoin has been trading steadily inside a price range, and the situation hasn’t changed much over the past few days. The cryptocurrency is still moving within a rising trend channel, with the upper boundary acting as resistance. At the moment, Bitcoin is holding above $107,9000. If it manages to push a little higher, it could test the $130,000 region within this cycle. However, traders should be prepared for a possible dip towards the $100,000–$104,000 support zone in the coming sessions. If Bitcoin stays above this area during a pullback, it would be a positive sign for a fresh rally. A deeper drop towards $91,000–$95,000 is still possible, but not necessary unless Bitcoin fails to hold its current range.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-2025-expert-says-160k-possible-this-cycle/,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING","News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis",cryptocompare
2025-06-25T15:40:06,"Ohio Crypto Legislation: Unlocking Potential for State Funds with Bold Digital Asset Investments","BitcoinWorld Ohio Crypto Legislation: Unlocking Potential for State Funds with Bold Digital Asset Investments Ohio is making headlines once again, signaling a powerful stride towards embracing the future of finance. The Buckeye State is quickly positioning itself as a vanguard in the evolving landscape of digital assets, with recent legislative efforts aiming to integrate cryptocurrencies into the state’s financial framework. This proactive stance, spearheaded by visionary lawmakers, marks a significant shift, potentially setting a precedent for other states looking to harness the innovative power of blockchain technology. The discussion around Ohio Crypto Legislation is no longer just theoretical; it’s becoming a tangible reality that could redefine how public funds are managed and invested. Understanding the Groundwork: Ohio’s Cryptocurrency Tax Exemption Before delving into the ambitious plans for state investments, it’s crucial to understand the foundational steps Ohio has already taken. The recent passage of House Bill 116 represents a pivotal moment, providing a clear signal of the state’s crypto-friendly intentions. This bill introduces a significant Cryptocurrency Tax Exemption , specifically for transactions under $200. While seemingly modest, its implications are far-reaching: Encouraging Micro-Transactions: By exempting small crypto transactions from capital gains tax, the bill removes a significant barrier for everyday use, making it easier for Ohioans to use digital assets for minor purchases without complex tax calculations. Boosting Adoption: This exemption can foster broader adoption of cryptocurrencies by reducing friction for new users and small businesses experimenting with crypto payments. Regulatory Clarity: It provides a degree of regulatory clarity, demonstrating that Ohio is willing to adapt its tax laws to accommodate digital currencies, a move often sought by the crypto community. Signaling Intent: More importantly, it acts as a legislative precursor, indicating a broader state strategy to embrace digital assets rather than shying away from them. This initial step has laid the groundwork for more ambitious proposals, demonstrating Ohio’s commitment to creating an environment conducive to cryptocurrency innovation and usage. The Game Changer: House Bill 18 and State Crypto Investments Building on the momentum of HB 116, Ohio Representative Steve Demetriou, a key proponent of both bills, is now pushing forward with House Bill 18. This proposed legislation is truly groundbreaking, aiming to authorize the state treasurer to engage in State Crypto Investments . This isn’t just about allowing individuals to use crypto; it’s about the state itself allocating a portion of its substantial public funds into the burgeoning digital asset market. Specifically, HB 18 proposes allowing up to 10% of select public funds to be invested in major cryptocurrencies by market cap. This targeted approach suggests a focus on established, less volatile (comparatively) digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), which represent the largest and most liquid portions of the crypto market. The implications are profound: Diversification of Public Portfolios: Introducing digital assets could offer a new avenue for diversification, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk by adding uncorrelated assets. Potential for Higher Returns: Cryptocurrencies, while volatile, have historically offered significantly higher returns than traditional asset classes, presenting an opportunity for growth in state funds. Institutional Adoption: This move would mark a significant step in institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies, lending further legitimacy to the asset class. Strategic Positioning: Ohio would join a select few entities globally exploring direct crypto investments for public coffers, positioning itself as a leader in financial innovation. The authority granted to the state treasurer underscores the trust placed in a professional’s ability to navigate this new financial frontier, making informed decisions on behalf of Ohio’s citizens. Why Consider Public Funds Crypto Investments? The Potential Benefits The decision to explore Public Funds Crypto investments isn’t made lightly. Proponents argue that the potential benefits far outweigh the perceived risks, especially when managed prudently. Here’s why Ohio might be taking this bold step: Enhanced Returns for State Funds: In an era of low interest rates and fluctuating traditional markets, cryptocurrencies offer a compelling opportunity for substantial capital appreciation. Even a small allocation could significantly boost returns for pension funds, educational endowments, or other state-managed portfolios, ultimately benefiting taxpayers. Economic Development and Innovation: By embracing digital assets, Ohio signals its openness to blockchain technology and the broader fintech industry. This can attract crypto businesses, startups, and skilled talent to the state, fostering job creation and economic growth within the innovation sector. Future-Proofing the Economy: The global financial landscape is rapidly evolving. By actively participating in the digital asset space, Ohio can gain valuable experience and insights, preparing its economy for a future where digital currencies and blockchain play a more central role. Diversification and Risk Management: While volatile, cryptocurrencies can act as a diversifier due to their low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds. A well-managed, small allocation can potentially enhance portfolio resilience and overall risk-adjusted returns. These potential advantages highlight a forward-thinking approach aimed at securing Ohio’s financial future and cementing its position as a hub for technological and financial innovation. Navigating the Risks: Challenges for State Funds Crypto While the allure of high returns and innovation is strong, investing Public Funds Crypto also comes with inherent challenges and risks that must be meticulously managed. Any decision to invest taxpayer money in a relatively new and volatile asset class demands rigorous due diligence and robust safeguards. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are known for their extreme price fluctuations. A 10% allocation, while seemingly small, could still expose state funds to significant losses if not managed with extreme caution and clear risk parameters. Regulatory Uncertainty: Despite recent clarity, the broader regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. remains fragmented and evolving. Future federal or state regulations could impact the legality, taxation, or operational aspects of these investments. Security and Custody Concerns: Securing large sums of digital assets requires specialized expertise and robust infrastructure to protect against hacks, theft, and other cyber threats. The custody solutions for institutional-grade crypto investments are complex and critical. Public and Political Scrutiny: Investing public money in cryptocurrencies is likely to face scrutiny from taxpayers, political opponents, and media. Transparency, accountability, and clear communication about the investment strategy and performance will be paramount. Liquidity Challenges: While Bitcoin and Ethereum are highly liquid, converting large institutional holdings back into fiat currency without impacting market prices requires careful execution. Addressing these challenges effectively will be key to the successful implementation of House Bill 18 and ensuring the long-term viability of Ohio’s crypto investment strategy. Lessons from Other States: A Glimpse into Digital Asset Adoption Ohio isn’t operating in a vacuum when it comes to exploring digital assets. Several other states and municipalities have already dipped their toes into the crypto waters, offering valuable lessons and precedents. For instance: Miami, Florida: Mayor Francis Suarez has been a vocal proponent of crypto, pushing initiatives like MiamiCoin to generate revenue for the city and exploring paying city employees in Bitcoin. Texas: The state has become a hub for Bitcoin mining due to its energy resources and favorable regulatory environment, attracting significant investment from crypto companies. Some pension funds have also explored indirect exposure to crypto through investment firms. Wyoming: Known for its progressive blockchain legislation, Wyoming has enacted laws to provide regulatory clarity for digital assets, including special purpose depository institutions (SPDIs) for crypto companies. While direct State Crypto Investments in public funds are still rare at the state level, these examples demonstrate a growing trend of governmental entities engaging with the crypto ecosystem in various capacities. Ohio’s approach with House Bill 18 could set a new benchmark for direct investment, moving beyond just fostering a crypto-friendly environment to actively participating in the market. What Does This Mean for Ohio’s Future? Actionable Insights The progression of Ohio Crypto Legislation , particularly House Bill 18, holds significant implications for various stakeholders: For Ohio Citizens: Potentially better-performing state funds could lead to improved public services or more stable pension plans. It also signifies Ohio’s commitment to being at the forefront of financial innovation. For Businesses: Crypto-related businesses might find Ohio an increasingly attractive location due to its progressive stance, potentially leading to new jobs and investment opportunities within the state. The tax exemption for small transactions also simplifies operations for businesses accepting crypto. For the Broader Crypto Industry: Ohio’s move could serve as a powerful endorsement of digital assets, encouraging other states and institutional investors to consider similar strategies, further legitimizing the asset class on a national scale. For Lawmakers and Policy Makers: It highlights the need for a nuanced understanding of digital assets and the importance of crafting legislation that balances innovation with prudent risk management. This initiative isn’t just about financial gains; it’s about positioning Ohio as a leader in the digital economy, ready to embrace the technological shifts that are reshaping global finance. The Road Ahead for Ohio Crypto Legislation While the momentum behind House Bill 18 is clear, its journey to becoming law will involve rigorous debate, detailed financial analysis, and careful consideration of implementation strategies. Key aspects that will need to be addressed include: Defining “Major Cryptocurrencies”: While generally understood to mean Bitcoin and Ethereum, the bill will need precise language to avoid ambiguity and ensure compliance. Risk Management Frameworks: Establishing clear guidelines for risk assessment, diversification within the crypto allocation, and loss limits will be crucial. Custody Solutions: Identifying secure and compliant institutional-grade custodians for the digital assets will be a primary concern. Performance Benchmarks and Reporting: Transparent mechanisms for tracking and reporting the performance of these investments will be essential for accountability. The passage of House Bill 18 would not only be a landmark achievement for Representative Demetriou but also a testament to Ohio’s pioneering spirit in navigating the complexities and opportunities of the digital age. It represents a bold step towards a future where digital assets are integrated into the fabric of traditional finance, starting right in the heart of the Midwest. Conclusion: Ohio’s Ambitious Leap into Digital Assets Ohio stands at the precipice of a significant financial evolution. With the passage of the Cryptocurrency Tax Exemption bill and the ambitious proposal of House Bill 18 to enable State Crypto Investments , the state is making a clear statement: it is ready to embrace the future of finance. These legislative efforts, championed by Representative Steve Demetriou, are designed not just to foster innovation but also to potentially unlock new avenues for growth and diversification for Public Funds Crypto . While challenges remain, Ohio’s proactive approach could set a powerful precedent for how states manage their financial resources in an increasingly digital world. The journey of House Bill 18 Ohio will be closely watched, as it holds the potential to reshape not only the state’s financial landscape but also influence the broader conversation around institutional adoption of digital assets across the nation.

US President Donald Trump Targeted Powell, Called Him ""Stupid"" Again! – ""I've Started Talks!""","US President Donald Trump harshly criticizes FED Chairman Jerome Powell at every opportunity. President Trump, who had previously called Powell an idiot, reiterated this rhetoric and targeted Powell again. Trump harshly criticizes Powell's interest rate policies, while arguing that the economy is in good shape and that interest rate cuts are necessary. At this point, Trump emphasizes that there should be aggressive interest rate cuts to stimulate the economy, while Powell continues to insist on keeping interest rates unchanged due to concerns about inflation and instability caused by tariffs. Powell became Trump's target with this attitude, and Trump called Powell an idiot in his speech today. “Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, I think, is a very stupid person. He has a low IQ for the job he does. I actually think he's a very stupid person. We'll be paying for him for years! We'll be paying 2 points or 3 points more on the debt! 3 points means $900 billion a year! He has a low IQ for what he does. Because he didn't want to just lower the interest rate instead of paying $900 billion!” Donald Trump also stated that he has candidates in mind to replace the Fed Chair. At this point, Trump said he was considering a candidate to replace the Fed chair and had even begun interviews with candidates. He added that he had interviewed three or four people for the next Fed chair. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: FED Chairman Jerome Powell Seems the Way!

2025-06-25T15:26:58,"Crypto ATMs in Australia turn scam hotspots","Crypto ATMs in Australia are officially under the microscope, and what regulators found is less “future of finance” and more “scammers are on the way.” In a nationwide sting operation, Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) identified 90 top crypto ATM users, and they weren’t whales or tech nerds. The report mentions that these users were mostly scam victims, money mules, and a handful of unwitting offenders unknowingly funneling dirty money through those flashing digital booths. This comes in when US states are tightening rules on crypto ATMs to curb rising scams, as these machines are often used by fraudsters, which allows easy cash-to-crypto conversion. Crypto ATMs turn scam hotspots The investigation, led by AUSTRAC and backed by federal and state police, has revealed that the majority of high-value crypto ATM transactions across the country were linked to scams. This involves romance scams, investment scams, and frauds done on the basis of different promises. As per the report , one woman in her 70s lost over $430,000 after getting duped by a combo of fake love and fake gains. However, there is no way of recovering the looted money. The task force tracked another woman in her 70s who sent $200K to a “trading firm” that vanished faster than your trust in the internet. The lady got conned after seeing what she thought was a legitimate advertisement about a firm that gave her hopes of massive returns. AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas didn’t mince words and stated that “We suspected that a large volume of crypto ATM transactions were probably illicit, but almost all the transactions we looked into were victims, not villains.” The reality is bleak as these machines, which were once seen as futuristic gateways into the crypto economy, are now being hijacked as tools in emotionally manipulative heists that leave victims broke and helpless. Cash-to-crypto scams soar The Australian watchdog has already dropped the hammer by introducing tighter regulations . This included a $5,000 cap on ATM transactions, mandatory scam warnings, enhanced ID checks, and better surveillance. Thomas advised that if one is considering using a crypto ATM and someone else asks you to deposit cash into one of these machines, think twice. Sending money to a wallet you don’t control likely means you’ll lose it. On the other side, States across the US are rolling out strict new laws to crack down on crypto kiosks. A report suggests that from 2020 to 2023, crypto ATM-related fraud ballooned nearly 10 times. The FBI says it got 99% more complaints in 2024, with $247 million in losses tied to these kiosks. Americans aged over 60 are more than three times as likely to get fleeced via a crypto ATM than their younger counterparts. It’s not just the scams, but it’s how they’re engineered. Scammers walk victims through every step, like go to this gas station, scan this code, feed in your cash. Most of these victims have never touched crypto before, and after the scam, they probably never will again. However, the digital assets market is growing day by day. The cumulative crypto market cap surged by more than 2% over the last 24 hours to stand at $3.31 trillion. Bitcoin is trading above $108K at the press time, while Ethereum is hovering around $2,439.

2025-06-25T15:25:12,"Bitwise Executive Says Bitcoin Jumped from $754 to $106,000 Across Three New York Mayors","Bitwise's Jeff Park has highlighted the meteoric Bitcoin surge over the decade, noting how this occurred through the terms of three New York Mayors. Park, who heads Alpha Strategies at Bitwise Asset Management, recently pointed out that Bitcoin climbed from around $754 to over $106,000 during the same stretch of time that New York City cycled through three different mayors. His comment connected the rise of Bitcoin with the city's political timeline. Specifically, when Michael Bloomberg left City Hall in December 2013, Bitcoin's price hovered just below $750. At that point, most people still saw it as a risky experiment rather than a serious investment. Bitcoin Rises 14,597% Through Three New York Mayors.Bill de Blasio took over in January 2014, and Bitcoin didn't move much right away. However, as his two terms rolled on, the crypto asset started gaining traction, independent of political ties. By the time de Blasio wrapped up his final year in office in December 2021, Bitcoin had skyrocketed to about $47,000.Eric Adams followed de Blasio and stepped into office in January 2022. Known for his pro-crypto stance, Adams announced that he would be taking his first few paychecks in Bitcoin. The crypto market faced some ups and downs during his time in office, especially during the 2022 bear market, but the general trend stayed upward, as a recovery sprang up from 2023. Most recently, Adams vowed to make New York the crypto capital of the world.Now, as the city heads toward its next election in November 2025, Bitcoin has passed the $106,000 mark. Particularly, within the period that New York rotated through Bloomberg to now Adams, Bitcoin has surged 14,597%, as highlighted in the chart. Bitcoin Growth Across Three New York Mayors Bitcoin Growth Across Three New York Mayors Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic Socialist and a rising political figure, has taken the lead in the Democratic primaries after Adams withdrew to run as an Independent. Because Democrats typically dominate New York politics, many expect Mamdani to win. Park referred to this expected change in leadership when he said the city had moved ""from Bloomberg to Mamdani,"" highlighting Bitcoin's steady rise during the same period.""Separate Money from State""In his commentary, Park suggested that Bitcoin's long-term growth has happened irrespective of the political changes happening around it. Notably, while new faces and ideologies come and go in government, Bitcoin continues to grow on its own terms. Citing this reality, Park advocated for a separation of money from the state. Essentially, this call indicates a broader belief that people should take control of their financial future instead of relying on state-backed systems.Mamdani's rise also represents a break from the more centrist politics of previous mayors like Bloomberg and Adams. This political change comes parallel to a financial one, where more people, especially younger generations, look to assets like Bitcoin as long-term alternatives to traditional finance and government oversight.Meanwhile, after suffering a brutal period over the weekend, Bitcoin has recovered considerably.

2025-06-25T15:20:07,"MSTY: This High-Risk, High-Yield ETF Is All Smoke And Mirrors","Summary Yieldmax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF's headline ~100%+ yield is mostly return of capital, not sustainable income, making the high payout misleading for long-term investors. The MSTY fund's synthetic covered call strategy on MicroStrategy Incorporated stock exposes it to significant downside risk, especially given MSTR's Bitcoin-driven volatility. While MSTY has outperformed peers in total return since inception, this is unlikely to be repeatable due to NAV erosion and unsustainable distributions. I do not recommend MSTY for long-term investors seeking sustainable growth; if you must invest, keep exposure minimal due to high risk. The Yieldmax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA: MSTY ) is one of a handful of ETFS that currently offer circa-100% yields. With typical yields between 1% and 5%, triple-digit distributions will surely turn heads. But is it MSTY worth it? Well, before I get into it, I think it’s important to give you a little of my background as it might assist in explaining my thesis. I consider myself a boring, long-term investor. My average holding is over eleven years, and I rarely sell. I buy and hold growth stocks over the long term, as well as quality dividend stocks for income generation, should I ever decide to retire. Most of my positions make up ~1.5 - 2% of my total portfolio, with a few Mag 7 positions taking up 8-9%. I do not invest in crypto - it’s not for me. However, I do like options income strategies like covered calls and cash-secured puts - which is why this article was fun to write. Attractive yields present a salivating opportunity for outsized distributions, if you understand the risks and are willing to take the plunge. MSTY offers an incredible distribution on the surface, but I say it’s mostly smoke and mirrors. Spoiler: I would not recommend MSTY. Let me explain. ETF Profile The YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy is one of many ETFs that YieldMax ( YMAX ) currently offers. The company itself went public in late 2022, with its first ETF being the TSLA Option Income Strategy ETF ( TSLY ). Its ETFs focus primarily on income-generating options strategies to generate distributions for its investors. MSTY itself was launched in early 2024 and focuses on selling covered calls on MicroStrategy Incorporated ( MSTR ), now simply Strategy . What’s interesting about this entire setup is Strategy’s business model - it functions less like a traditional tech firm and more like a proxy Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) holding company, with the vast majority of its balance sheet tied up in cryptocurrency. Strategy Inc Source: Strategy Inc. As of June 25, 2025, Strategy held 592,345 BTC , with an average cost of $70,681 per share, or approximately $41.857 billion in total. Uncovering YieldMax’s MSTY ETF Going back to YieldMax’s MSTY, the fund invests in a combination of long and short calls and short puts to create a synthetic covered call position. To understand the fund’s makeup, we need to first understand what a synthetic long position is, and what synthetic covered calls are. A synthetic long position requires three components: Cash/cash-like asset for collateral Short Put Long Call. The options usually have the same expiration date and strike. The short put allows the investor to participate in the downside, while the long call offers unlimited upside. When combined, the position costs less than directly owning the underlying asset, and carries the same risk as owning the underlying outright. Next, we have the synthetic covered call. With a traditional covered call, the investor sells a call on a stock they already own. The synthetic version allows the investor to sell up to an equal amount of calls against the portfolio’s long calls. Should the short call be assigned, the investor or fund manager can assign the long call position to cover the short call assignment. Since MSTY is selling calls, any volatility in MSTR - and Bitcoin by extension - can be a good thing. Higher volatility means higher premiums, though it comes with higher risk. MSTY Holdings Summary Here’s a complete breakdown of MSTY’s holdings: Options Positions Position Type Strike Price Market Value ( USD ) Portfolio Weight (%) MSTR Long Call $370.01 (Exp. 07/11) $14,927,428.60 0.31% MSTR Short Put $370.01 (Exp. 07/11) -$8,400,115.03 -0.18% MSTR Short Put $370.01 (Exp. 07/18) -$109,305,245.32 -2.30% MSTR Short Put $380.01 (Exp. 07/18) -$61,518,470.66 -1.29% MSTR Short Call $382.50 (Exp. 06/27) -$4,175,000.00 -0.09% MSTR Short Call $385 (Exp 6/27) -$5,862,500.00 -0.12% MSTR Short Call $387.5 (Exp 6/27) -$13,092,750.00 -0.28% MSTR Short Call $390 (Exp 6/27) -$3,416,400.00 -0.07% MSTR Short Call $392.50 (Exp 6/27) -$820,000.00 -0.02% MSTR Long Call $400 (Exp 6/27) $780,000.00 0.02% MSTR Short Call $420 (Exp 6/27) -$195,000.00 0.00% MSTR Short Call $380 (Exp 7/3) -$3,590,000.00 -0.08% MSTR Short Call $390 (Exp 7/25) -$2,675,000.00 -0.06% MSTR Short Call $392.50 (Exp 7/25) -$1,168,750.00 -0.02% MSTR Short Call $395 (Exp 7/25) -$1,018,750.00 -0.02% MSTR Short Call $397.50 (Exp 7/25) -$887,500.00 -0.02% MSTR Long Call $410 (Exp 7/3) $730,000.00 0.02% MSTR Long Call $370 (Exp 7/18) $177,903,812.50 3.74% MSTR Long Call $380 (Exp 7/18) $55,104,000.00 1.16% Cash & Securities Positions Security Name Market Value (( USD )) Portfolio Weight (%) United States Treasury Bill 02/19/2026 $112,447,601.12 2.37% United States Treasury Bill 08/14/2025 $591,975,469.68 12.45% United States Treasury Bill 11/06/2025 $385,386,926.47 8.11% United States Treasury Note/Bond 3% 07/15/2025 $382,337,797.02 8.04% United States Treasury Note/Bond 4.25% 10/15/2025 $638,453,855.82 13.43% United States Treasury Note/Bond 3.875% 01/15/2026 $1,123,742,006.11 23.64% First American Government Obligations Fund 12/01/2031 $61,088,195.28 1.29% Cash & Other $1,424,002,851.14 29.96% Source: YieldMax . MSTY earns premiums by selling options, which serve as its primary source of cash flow. All of its short call positions are short-dated, with the synthetic positions expiring further out. Furthermore, cash and treasury bonds make up a significant portion of MSTY’s holdings. This risk-free collateral supports the option strategy’s collateral requirements and facilitates redemptions. The inherent stability of treasury notes can also serve as a stabilizer against the volatility of MSTR. Strategy Risks Now, for reference, covered calls earn income through selling options, but at the cost of limited upside. That means any strong upward rally for MSTR will not translate to additional distributions for shareholders. Since the ETF’s gains are limited to the strike price of the short calls, extreme rallies can lead to missed upside and costs associated with repositioning the options, especially in synthetic strategies like MSTY’s. If MSTR falls significantly below the strike prices of those puts, the fund could face early assignment or, more realistically, mark-to-market losses due to the increased value of the short puts. These synthetic exposures can behave similarly to being “assigned,” impacting the fund’s net asset value and potentially reducing its ability to generate or maintain distributions during that period. However, I would imagine that management would roll out said positions before that happens, though that would entail additional costs and, again, decrease distributions. Peer Comparison Now, onto the juicy parts. Instead of comparing MSTY to other YieldMax ETFs, I’ll compare it to other ETFs that utilize similar option strategies on MSTR or Bitcoin itself. As an introduction, here are the members of this peer group, along with their respective expense ratios (portfolio fees) and yields. ETF Ticker ETF Name Expense Ratio TTM Yield Inception Date MSTY YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF 0.99% 139.46% 2/21/24 YBTC Roundhill Bitcoin Covered Call Strategy ETF 0.96% 45.0% 1/18/24 IMST Bitwise MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF 0.98% 13.93% 4/1/25 BTCC Grayscale Bitcoin Covered Call ETF 0.66% 7.01% 4/2/25 BAGY Amplify Bitcoin Max Income Covered Call ETF 0.65% 2.69% 4/29/25 BCCC Global X Bitcoin Covered Call ETF 0.75% 0.79% 6/3/25 JEPI JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF 0.35% 8.32% 5/20/20 Source: Rick Orford. I added the inception date to provide a more comprehensive view of the peer group, as most are new and have not yet completed a full-year distribution cycle. I also added the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF as a more realistic baseline reference for option-driven ETFs. From the chart above, MSTY pays the highest yield out of all the ETFs on a trailing twelve-month basis, even compared to Roundhill Bitcoin Covered Call Strategy ETF, which was launched before MSTY. This makes MSTY a bit of an outlier in terms of income generation, though it comes with outsized risks due to its particular income-generating strategy. But to be fair, we should examine the ETF's price movement for a comprehensive review. YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF Price Action & Total Returns MSTY is down 2.55% since its initial public offering in February 2024. Over the same period, its closest peer, YBTC, has lost 7.2%. The remainder of the ETF’s are still very embryonic and choppy. Seeking Alpha NAV and Market Price Now that we've looked at MSTY’s price chart and total return, it’s important to determine how well the fund’s net asset value ((NAV)) has tracked its market price. As per the company’s data, MSTY’s NAV sits at $20.54 as of May 31, 2025. At the time, the closing price was $20.57, meaning the fund was trading at a slight premium. YieldMax Source: YieldMax . Now, small fluctuations between NAV-to-price comparisons are to be expected, especially with a high-yield ETF. However, it’s still reasonably close, which is a positive sign that its arbitrage mechanisms work. Distributions and Total Net Return YieldMax Now, with all that out of the way, let’s highlight arguably the most important aspect of this article: MSTY’s distribution. Since inception, MSTY holders would have received between $1.3356 and $4.213 per unit. However, that only paints a partial picture of your potential benefit as an investor. We need to look at total returns to get a better picture. Below is a chart outlining total returns, assuming an investor bought MSTY at its all-time high date (March 28, 2024), and held it to today. And I’ll compare it with YBTC and JEPI - the only ones in the peer group that were active during that time. ETF Price on Mar 28, 2024 Current Price Capital Gain/Loss Distributions Received Net Total Return ($) Net Total Return (%) MSTY $42.99 $21.05 –$21.94 $38.37 $16.93 +39.38% YBTC $55.16 $45.58 –$9.58 $24.94 $15.36 +27.85% JEPI $57.86 $56.57 –$1.29 $5.70 $4.41 +7.62% Source: Rick Orford. So, even after a dramatic 49% price drop with MSTY, an investor who bought at MSTY at its peak would still be up by almost $17 per share, or around 39% of their initial investment. My Concerns Around Return of Capital MSTY’s latest distribution of $1.4707 was 97.45% return of capital ((ROC)) and just 2.55% income. In other words, $97.45 of every $100 in distributions paid was the investor's own money. It’s more or less in line with a majority of its peer group, except for Bitwise MSTR Option Income and possibly JEPI (due to its more diversified nature). ETF Ticker Latest Distribution % Return of Capital (ROC) % Income MSTY (YieldMax MSTR Option Income) $1.4707 97.45% 2.55% YBTC (Roundhill Bitcoin Covered Call) $0.20 100% 0% IMST (Bitwise MSTR Option Income) $7.01 0% 100% BTCC (Grayscale Bitcoin Covered Call) $0.9449 100% 0% BAGY (Amplify Bitcoin Max Income Covered Call) $1.4613 96% 4% BCCC (Global X Bitcoin Covered Call)* $0.14 (CAD) No Data (Released at year-end) No Data (Released at year-end) JEPI (JPMorgan Equity Premium Income) $0.5400 No Data No Data Source: Rick Orford. Now, ROC isn't inherently bad. In fact, it can be tax-efficient in the short term as ROC distributions are simply your own money given back to you, reducing your cost basis, and deferring tax liability until you sell the ETF. However, when most of MSTY’s distributions are comprised of ROC instead of actual income for most of the time, it raises significant concerns about the sustainability of these distributions. While this can be highly effective in the short term, especially during periods of high volatility, it means the ETF often returns premium income (or capital) to shareholders rather than growing the underlying NAV. Any negative market movement, such as MSTR underperforming or its positions incurring mark-to-market losses, can accelerate NAV erosion, which in turn may reduce the fund’s ability to maintain future payouts. In that sense, MSTY’s distributions are less of a yield from earnings and more of a structured return of capital. Verdict So, yes, MSTY’s high yield and relatively stable NAV might make compelling selling points, but its prospects are not as rosy as they appear on the surface. We can’t ignore the fact that any investor who bought at its peak is still up by $16, thanks to its triple-digit yields and despite the deep price downturn. But is this repeatable? And how long would it take for the losses to outpace the returns and eat away at your capital? Remember, in 2021 Bitcoin hit $60,000, then experienced a significant decline and was trading at just above $16,000 by the end of 2022. During the same period, MSTR experienced a price decline of around 70% to 80%. And even though some people might like to think that “it's only up from here,” Bitcoin is notoriously volatile and often goes through multi-year boom-and-bust cycles. If that happens, MSTY’s synthetic long exposure would place it directly in the line of fire. Deep-in-the-money short puts and collapsing long call values would result in mark-to-market losses and steep NAV erosion. That would likely force the fund to either cut distributions sharply or continue paying out return of capital while its NAV collapses and its ability to recover evaporates. And that’s my core issue with MSTY - it’s not built for long-term, multi-year sustainable growth, and it certainly doesn’t align with my investment preferences. It’s structured more for income extraction, not capital appreciation, and that income is highly dependent on favorable volatility conditions, which never last forever. That’s why I can’t recommend this fund. However, if you do buy the ETF, I’d suggest keeping your exposure low. That way, when the tide inevitably turns, you don’t lose a big chunk of your portfolio.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4797205-msty-this-high-risk-high-yield-etf-is-all-smoke-and-mirrors?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","YMAX|TSLY|MSTR|BTC-USD|YBTC|IMST|BTCC|BAGY|BCCC|JEPI|MCSYP|STRF|STRK|MSTY",cryptocompare

2025-06-25T15:10:01,"Genesis DCG Lawsuit: Shocking Allegations Unveiled","BitcoinWorld Genesis DCG Lawsuit: Shocking Allegations Unveiled The crypto world is no stranger to dramatic turns, but few sagas have captured attention quite like the ongoing dispute between bankrupt crypto lender Genesis and its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG). What began as a financial unraveling has escalated into an explosive legal battle, with Genesis now accusing DCG of knowingly enabling its own collapse. This isn’t just about a company going under; it’s about a deep dive into alleged corporate negligence and a stark reminder of the interconnectedness within the crypto ecosystem. The Explosive Genesis DCG Lawsuit: Unpacking the Allegations At the heart of the matter lies a newly unsealed complaint, first reported by Cointelegraph, that paints a damning picture of the relationship between Genesis and DCG. Genesis, once a prominent crypto lender, alleges that DCG executives, including CFO Michael Kraines, were not only aware of significant legal risks but also privately discussed worst-case scenarios should Genesis fail. This revelation suggests a level of foresight that clashes sharply with the public narrative of unforeseen market shocks. The core of the Genesis DCG lawsuit revolves around the accusation that DCG deliberately kept Genesis afloat, not to save it, but to allegedly drain its balance sheet and project a false sense of stability to the market. Imagine a lifeline being extended, not for rescue, but for strategic advantage – that’s the chilling claim Genesis is making. This isn’t merely a dispute over funds; it’s a profound challenge to the integrity and ethical conduct of a major player in the digital asset space. Did DCG Ignore Dire Financial Warnings Crypto? One of the most critical aspects of Genesis’s complaint is the assertion that DCG disregarded urgent warnings. External consultants reportedly flagged serious concerns, yet DCG allegedly delayed action, even as Genesis’s loan book ballooned from $4 billion to a staggering $12 billion. This isn’t a minor oversight; it points to a systemic disregard for crucial risk management, raising questions about accountability. Internal records cited in the complaint describe Genesis as “flying blind” during this period of rapid expansion. Furthermore, auditors had reportedly flagged serious control failures as early as 2020, years before the eventual collapse. These financial warnings crypto firms receive are meant to be red flags, prompting immediate corrective action. The alleged failure to act on these warnings, despite their severity and longevity, forms a significant part of Genesis’s case against its parent company. The Anatomy of a Crypto Lender Collapse: Beyond External Shocks While external events like the Terra-Luna crash and the Three Arrows Capital (3AC) implosion certainly contributed to market instability, Genesis’s complaint suggests internal factors played a far more insidious role in its crypto lender collapse . The lawsuit details a “toxic culture” within Genesis, where staff allegedly faced immense pressure to prioritize DCG’s interests, even if it meant compromising Genesis’s own financial health. Consider the aftermath of the 3AC collapse, a pivotal moment that sent shockwaves through the industry. Genesis staff were reportedly given scripted messages, while DCG executives allegedly downplayed the crisis internally. This alleged manipulation of information, if true, highlights a dangerous precedent for transparency and investor confidence in the crypto lending sector. It implies a deliberate strategy to manage perceptions rather than address underlying problems head-on, potentially leaving countless investors exposed. Digital Currency Group Under Fire: What’s Next for the Empire? The stakes in this legal battle are incredibly high. Genesis is now seeking over $3.3 billion in damages from DCG and its CEO, Barry Silbert. This isn’t their first skirmish; Genesis previously filed a $1.2 billion lawsuit against DCG in May. The escalating nature of these claims puts immense pressure on Digital Currency Group , a sprawling conglomerate that includes prominent entities like Grayscale, the manager of the world’s largest Bitcoin trust (GBTC). The outcome of this lawsuit could have far-reaching implications for DCG’s financial stability, its reputation, and its ability to operate effectively within the highly scrutinized crypto landscape. A multi-billion-dollar judgment against it could force significant restructuring or even divestment of assets, potentially reshaping the institutional crypto market as we know it. This legal saga serves as a stark reminder that even the largest players are not immune to intense scrutiny and accountability. Barry Silbert Allegations: At the Helm of the Storm? Central to Genesis’s claims are the direct accusations leveled against Barry Silbert, the founder and CEO of Digital Currency Group. As the architect of DCG and a highly influential figure in the crypto space, Silbert’s alleged involvement in the decisions leading to Genesis’s downfall places him directly in the crosshairs of this lawsuit. The complaint suggests a disparity between Silbert’s public persona as a visionary leader and the internal records detailing the alleged mismanagement. The Barry Silbert allegations underscore the challenges of corporate governance in a rapidly evolving industry. When a parent company’s interests are perceived to override those of its subsidiary, especially to the detriment of its creditors, it raises serious questions about fiduciary duties and ethical leadership. The legal battle will undoubtedly scrutinize his communications, decisions, and the extent of his knowledge regarding Genesis’s deteriorating financial health. Challenges and Implications for the Crypto Market This lawsuit isn’t just about two companies; it has broader implications for the entire crypto market. It highlights several key challenges: Loss of Investor Trust: Such high-profile disputes erode confidence, making investors wary of centralized crypto services. Regulatory Scrutiny: Lawsuits of this magnitude inevitably draw the attention of regulators, potentially leading to stricter oversight and new regulations for crypto lending and inter-company dealings. Interconnectedness Risk: The case exposes the dangers of highly interconnected corporate structures within crypto, where the failure of one entity can cascade throughout an entire group. Transparency Deficit: The allegations of downplaying crises and operating ‘blind’ underscore a persistent need for greater transparency in the digital asset industry. Actionable Insights for Crypto Participants While the Genesis-DCG saga unfolds, there are valuable lessons for investors and participants in the crypto space: Due Diligence is Paramount: Before committing funds to any platform, conduct thorough research into its parent company, its financial health, and its history. Look beyond marketing hype. Understand Interdependencies: Be aware of how different entities within a crypto conglomerate are connected. A problem in one division can quickly affect others. Diversify and Decentralize: Don’t put all your eggs in one centralized basket. Explore decentralized finance (DeFi) options, but understand their risks too. Diversification across different platforms and asset types can mitigate risk. Stay Informed: Follow reputable news sources and official court documents to understand the evolving landscape of crypto regulations and legal challenges. A Lingering Shadow Over Crypto Lending The Genesis-DCG lawsuit serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent risks and complexities within the crypto lending sector. It underscores the importance of robust corporate governance, transparent financial reporting, and ethical leadership. As the legal proceedings unfold, the crypto community will be watching closely, hoping that this painful chapter ultimately leads to a more mature, resilient, and trustworthy industry. The outcome of this unprecedented legal battle will not only determine the fate of Genesis and DCG but will also send a clear message about accountability in the digital asset space, potentially reshaping how crypto businesses operate and interact with their subsidiaries and, most importantly, with their customers.

2025-06-25T15:08:08,"Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino Makes Bold Statements About Bitcoin (BTC)!","The leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) is on the rise again with FED Chairman Jerome Powell's interest rate cut statements and news of a ceasefire between Iran and Israel. At this point, while the BTC price rose above $ 108,000, bold statements came from Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino. According to The Block, Tether CEO claimed that the company could become the largest BTC mining company by the end of the year. Tether CEO recently said on the Big Brain podcast that Tether holds more than 100,000 BTC in total, and that the company’s Bitcoin mining operations play an important role in securing investments. Stating that they made approximately $13 billion in profit from mining in 2024 with their team of less than 200 people, the famous CEO stated that mining is important to secure Bitcoin investments rather than for profit purposes. Ardoino underlined that mining is necessary for Tether's BTC reserves, noting that Tether's Bitcoin mining operations are strategically important in securing the $10 billion Bitcoin investment. “I think if you have $1 million and you have to decide whether to invest it in Bitcoin mining or buying Bitcoin outright, it’s clear that you’re always going to make more money buying Bitcoin outright. But in our case, given our exposure to Bitcoin, it's important to be part of the security of the network. Realistically, by the end of this year, Tether will be the largest bitcoin miner in the market.” Tether, which has also made great strides in Bitcoin mining, has invested more than $2 billion in energy production and mining infrastructure at 15 sites in Uruguay, Paraguay, and El Salvador since 2023. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-25T15:06:59,"Top Cryptos to Watch: These Are Poised for Breakout According to Data","New on-chain data has revealed a widening profit gap across major crypto assets, fueling speculation on which coins are overheated and which are primed for a breakout. According to market intelligence platform Santiment, 94.5% of Bitcoin (BTC) holders are sitting on unrealized gains, with Ethereum (ETH) trailing slightly at 88.7%. On the flip side, less than half of Cardano (ADA) holders are in the green, highlighting deep-seated bearish sentiment and potential undervaluation. Behind the Divide Santiment’s analysis shows a classic market tension, where coins with the most holders in profit, like BTC, tend to attract investor confidence but also risk triggering sell-offs. This is especially relevant now, given Bitcoin’s recent climb past $106,000. In the last 24 hours, the king cryptocurrency gained a formidable 2%, and nearly 3.4% over the week, reinforcing its stronghold amid easing geopolitical tensions. Yesterday, on-chain expert Axel Adler Jr. confirmed that about 720,000 BTC were sold over the last two months. Yet, Bitcoin absorbed the pressure rather than crashing, thanks to strong demand from new buyers. The Realized Cap for 0–1 month holders spiked by $66 billion since April, marking one of the most significant profit-taking waves in recent memory. However, Adler’s UTXO model now shows a cooldown in selling, suggesting reduced downside risk in the short term. Meanwhile, ADA is spiraling in the opposite direction. Currently trading around $0.60 after a 23.6% slide in the last 30 days, only 46.5% of its holders are in profit, potentially making it attractive for long-term contrarians. While analysts such as Marcus Corvinus see bullish patterns and oversold RSI conditions, significant hurdles remain. Whale sell-offs, including a recent 270 million ADA dump, and persistent negative momentum are challenging such narratives. ETH, DOGE, and XRP Even as Bitcoin basks in broad profitability, major altcoins are painting a fragmented picture. ETH, with 88.7% of holders profitable, faces near-term leverage risks. Earlier in the week, Matrixport warned that crowded futures positioning could threaten further downside, contributing to its 4.2% weekly drop to around $2,430. Looking at XRP, with 65.1% of holders above water, and Dogecoin (DOGE), which has 64.7% of investors sitting pretty, there are still undertones of technical fragility. At the time of this writing, XRP was trading at $2.18, down 7.4% in the last month, while DOGE has been consolidating nervously between $0.16 and $0.18. Market watcher Ali Martinez recently warned that a break either way could trigger a 60% swing. All things considered, Santiment’s data suggests that coins like Chainlink (LINK), with just under 60% of its owners showing a return, and ADA may have untapped upside if broader sentiment lifts. Key triggers include Bitcoin’s ability to hold $100,000 support amid profit-taking, Ethereum’s leverage unwind, and whether the altcoins can convert technical oversold signals into sustained demand.

2025-06-25T15:05:00,"Bitcoin Rebounds To 8-Day-High, But Key Concern Lies In Trading Volume","Summary Bitcoin climbs to an eight-day high near $106,800, but pullback highlights stiff resistance. RSI crosses into bullish territory while price enters the upper half of bearish channel. Volume on Binance weakens amid doubts about the Middle-East cease-fire. By Sholanke Dele The rally, which began earlier this week after a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran, has pushed Bitcoin over 6% higher since Monday. However, the price met stiff resistance exactly at the $106,800 level, which prompted a brief pullback. Despite the minor retracement, Bitcoin is edging higher again in today’s European session, pointing to renewed bullish interest. Price action suggests that if Bitcoin can break past the $106,800 resistance zone, a retest of the top boundary of the prevailing bearish channel is likely. As of today, that upper trendline is just below the $109,000 mark. BTC price dynamics (April - June 2025). Source: TradingView The broader technical setup offers mixed signals. Since May, Bitcoin has traded within a descending channel, which has acted as a structural bearish formation. The latest rebound from below the $100,000 psychological level has now brought price to the top half of the channel. This shift is being reinforced by a change in the daily relative strength index. The RSI, which had lingered in bearish territory, has now crossed into bullish territory. This transition reflects strengthening upward momentum, increasing the chances of a resistance breakout. Bitcoin sentiment stays neutral amid doubts about ceasefire reliability However, a key concern lies in the trading volume. On Binance, Bitcoin's rally this week has been accompanied by declining volume, which tempers the enthusiasm around the price recovery. The muted participation coincides with the fear and greed index sitting at neutral, suggesting that traders are still evaluating the reliability of the ceasefire, which was reportedly breached at certain points. Despite the violations, the ceasefire message has acted as a stabilizing force in the crypto market. If price fails to clear $106,800, near-term support sits at the 20-day exponential moving average around $105,000. Holding this support could maintain the bullish bias, while a rejection may send Bitcoin back toward the lower channel boundary. Overall, momentum has shifted upward, but a sustained breakout will require confirmation through stronger volume. Bitcoin jumped 5% after the Israel-Iran ceasefire lifted market sentiment .

2025-06-25T15:04:37,"Crypto Market Sees Major Pullback as Top Narratives Suffer Double-Digit Losses","The previous month has delivered a severe dose of reality to the cryptocurrency sector, with major investment stories suffering steep write-downs. There’s been no place to hide across our sectors, from cutting-edge developments in data availability and decentralized infrastructure to old favorites like AI tokens and memecoins. As per the latest industry statistics, sentiment has taken a sharp turn as investors pull back from speculative positions, and we’re seeing a resulting selloff that’s reflected in the performance of our leading narratives. Now, we’ve had volatility in the market before, but what’s standing out about the last 30 days is just how much has declined and how many different areas of the market have been affected. To us, this looks like a potential shift from risk-on to risk-off. Data Availability and Bitcoin Ecosystem Lead the Decline The narrative surrounding data availability has taken the toughest blows in this latest round of market corrections. Availability of data is a necessary part of the blockchain scalability effort (see Blocksize, Too Many Nodes, Data Availability, and Diversity, Scaling the Stack). Data availability is critical to the performance of rollups (see more on those in the Multicoin presentation linked above). Rollups are a way of scaling blockchains that holds great promise. Thanks to them, the development of decentralized applications might at last be able to overcome the scalability problem. In losses close behind is the Bitcoin ecosystem. Previously, the ecosystem had benefited from revitalized enthusiasm about protocols based on Bitcoin, ordinals, and Layer 2 solutions. But as the price of Bitcoin became increasingly volatile and downward market momentum set in, even innovations surrounding Bitcoin were no longer attracting investment. Another large sector that took a big hit was the decentralized physical infrastructure networks. Projects in this sector, which were started earlier in the year, seemed well on their way to building real networked hardware across the world, all coordinated with blockchain technology. But with a dwindling risk appetite, the long-term vision of these projects appears to be losing favor with short-term thinkers. AI, Memecoins, and Gaming Fail to Hold Investor Interest Not even the most talked-about sectors in the market have been able to escape this downturn. Artificial intelligence tokens—a breakout story in early 2024—have also seen pullbacks, as the initial hype began to lose steam and investors likely began to scrutinize whether token-based AI projects could really deliver tangible results at scale. GROWTH RATE OF TOP NARRATIVES IN THE PAST 30 DAYS The market is undergoing a sharp correction as all major narratives have recorded significant declines over the past month: Data Availability took the hardest hit with a drop of -38.6% The #Bitcoin Ecosystem (-31.8%) and… pic.twitter.com/aulRaJNIjE — Followin (@followin_io) June 24, 2025 Memecoins, which are often thought of as the purest expression of crypto’s speculative spirit, saw steep losses, too. The attraction of fast profits and viral community movements has cooled a lot in recent weeks, as we’re under the draw of rising regulatory scrutiny and a broader market uncertainty that has many retail investors backing away. The story and the told story in gaming are seen as bridges that can carry blockchain technology to the mass audience. Apart from GameFi’s building and evolving, is it fair to say that investor confidence is somewhat shaky at the moment? If so, do you think it might be because we’re still waiting for big, shiny products to materialize? Store of Value Holds Strong Amid Market Weakness While almost all sectors experienced large losses, one narrative stood out as the most resilient: store of value. Often linked with assets like Bitcoin and various stable, performing tokens, this realm saw only a mild decline. That relatively gentle drop suggests that, in these turbulent times, some investors are retreating to safer, more established holdings, rather than making a full exit from the market. Store of value assets perform much better than we had expected, underscoring the original crypto use case of preserving wealth in a digital world. In times of volatility, when the macroeconomic outlook is in doubt, perceived stable assets tend to outperform high-risk, high-reward plays. Outlook: From Hype Cycles to Fundamental Repricing A potential transition may be afoot in the crypto market, establishing this previously largely unregulated space more firmly within the realm of legitimate capital markets. That is, in a fundamental-sense way, like a real market, a regulated market. As the market consolidates, attention will focus on project teams to produce genuine usefulness, scalability, and real user adoption in the world. Meanwhile, cautious investors are likely to prioritize risk management over project management. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

2025-06-25T15:02:51,"Tether hints at competing with corporate miners","Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, said the company could become a leading BTC miner in 2025, branching out to boost network security. The statement came after Tether disclosed holdings of 100K BTC, making it one of the most significant whales with long-term reserves. Tether may become one of the leading miners after taking up the role of securing the network, said the company’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, during the Big Brain podcast . While Tether has been a part of the crypto ecosystem in multiple ways, there have been no explicit mentions of building actual mining infrastructure. ‘I think that it is clear that if you have $1 million and you have to decide where to put it, either in bitcoin mining or in buying bitcoin directly, you would always make more money buying bitcoin directly,’ said Ardoino. ‘ But in our case, I think given the exposure that we have to Bitcoin, it’s important to be part of the security of the network. Realistically, by the end of this year, Tether will become the biggest bitcoin miner out there. ’ Tether has not disclosed its current hashrate, though it has made known investments into energy infrastructure in Uruguay, Paraguay, and El Salvador. Tether supports multiple elements in the local energy infrastructure, while also owning undisclosed shares in third-party mining companies. Tether hints at competing with corporate miners Tether may expand its mining influence at a time when the Bitcoin network is working at a record hashrate, and remains profitable for most participants. The Bitcoin network hashrate recently fell to a six-month low, sinking back to around 700 EH/s. This would translate into a lower network difficulty and easier competition for miners. The easier mining arrives at a time when BTC managed to recover above $107,000, making block production still profitable for most pools. The Bitcoin hashrate fell from its recent peak, making the network more accessible to miners. | Source: Bitbo There are a few remaining miners with solo operations, as even big data centers often add their hashrate to pools. Some of the biggest operations include Mara Holdings, CleanSpark, IREN, Core Scientific, and others. Tether itself has not reported the exact hashrate or share of mining operations. Unlike corporate miners, Tether has also not positioned itself as a BTC treasury company, despite its vast holdings accrued over the years. Tether also denied rumors of going public or tying its stock price to BTC holdings. Earlier this year, Tether shared that it intends to set aside another $500M for mining activity. Tether also stated it would point most of its mining capacity at Ocean Pool , a relatively small operation with 9.61 EH/s. So far, Tether has only contributed a part of the pool’s hashrate, and there are no signs the company holds enough capacity to surpass giant operations like Mara Holdings with over 57 EH/s. Tether’s known wallets also rarely show BTC inflows, especially those identifiable as originating with mining pools. Ocean Pool aims to offer zero-fee access, as well as direct decentralized payments for all participants. If Tether is indeed serious about becoming a leading miner, the pool’s hashrate may reflect the expansion. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-06-25T15:00:57,"Dogecoin Price Closes Daily Candle With A Doji, What This Means","The Dogecoin price is in focus, having closed the daily candle with a Doji. Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade commented on this development and revealed what it could mean for the foremost meme coin. What’s Next For Dogecoin Price Following Doji Daily Close In an X post, Trader Tardigrade highlighted the fact that the Dogecoin price daily candle closed with a Doji. He remarked that a new sign of a breakout has emerged following a Doji at the end of a downtrend. The analyst noted that this indicates a high possibility of a trend reversal from downtrend to uptrend. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Enters Historical Bounce Zone, But Will This Time Be Different? The Dogecoin price has witnessed a massive decline over the last month, down over 27% during this period, according to CoinMarketCap data. DOGE has dropped way below the psychological $0.2 price level, providing a bearish outlook for the meme coin. However, Trader Tardigrade’s analysis suggested that the meme coin could soon record another massive rally to the upside. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that the Dogecoin price could reclaim the $0.2 level on this projected trend reversal to the upside. Fundamentals also support a DOGE rally, seeing as tensions in the Middle East have cooled off, with Israel and Iran agreeing to a ceasefire. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin price has again rallied and reclaimed the $106,000 level. This is bullish for the meme coin given its correlation with the flagship crypto. In another X post, Trader Tardigrade provided a bullish outlook for the Dogecoin price, stating that DOGE season could be approaching soon. He revealed that the DOGE/BTC pair has experienced the last shakeout, signaling the start of the meme coin’s season. His accompanying chart showed that Dogecoin could rally above $2 once this DOGE season begins. Key Levels To Watch For DOGE In a YouTube video, crypto analyst Kevin Capital highlighted the range between $0.12 and $0.142 as the key level to watch for the Dogecoin price. The analyst also alluded to DOGE’s weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI), stating that the meme coin cannot afford to drop below 38. He claimed that a drop could lead to the meme coin falling into a bear market structure. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Crash Below $0.2: 4H Order Block Shows Exactly What’s Happening Kevin Capital then highlighted the DOGE/BTC pair, noting that the meme coin is at a critical level that it needs to hold above if it is to outperform Bitcoin later in the year. The analyst expects the meme coin to make a significant run and outperform the flagship crypto when the Fed begins to ease monetary policies. The analyst remarked that a positive for DOGE is that there are bullish indicators flashing for the meme coin on the daily timeframe. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.16, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

2025-06-25T15:00:54,"Aurora Mobile Unlocks Massive Crypto Treasury Strategy: A Game Changer for Digital Asset Adoption","BitcoinWorld Aurora Mobile Unlocks Massive Crypto Treasury Strategy: A Game Changer for Digital Asset Adoption In a move that signals growing confidence in the digital asset space, marketing technology provider Aurora Mobile has made headlines by approving a groundbreaking crypto treasury strategy . This isn’t just another company dipping its toes; Aurora Mobile is committing up to 20% of its cash and cash equivalents to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Sui (SUI). What does this bold decision mean for the future of corporate finance and the broader crypto market? Let’s dive in. What Does Aurora Mobile’s Crypto Treasury Strategy Entail? The core of Aurora Mobile’s announcement, as reported by Solid Intel on X, revolves around a significant allocation of corporate funds into digital assets. Traditionally, corporate treasuries are managed with a conservative approach, focusing on liquidity, capital preservation, and modest returns through traditional instruments like cash, bonds, and money market funds. Aurora Mobile’s decision to allocate a substantial portion—up to one-fifth—of its cash reserves into volatile, yet potentially high-growth, cryptocurrencies marks a departure from this norm. Significant Allocation: Up to 20% of cash and cash equivalents. This is a considerable percentage for a publicly traded company. Diversified Portfolio: Beyond just Bitcoin, the strategy includes Ethereum, Solana, and Sui, indicating a belief in a multi-chain future and the diverse applications within the crypto ecosystem. Strategic Intent: This isn’t merely speculative trading but a formal treasury strategy, suggesting a long-term view on the value and utility of digital assets. This move positions Aurora Mobile alongside a growing list of forward-thinking companies that are exploring or actively implementing digital asset strategies for their balance sheets. It underscores a fundamental shift in how corporate finance departments view and utilize emerging technologies. Why Are Companies Adopting a Crypto Treasury Strategy Now? The trend of companies holding cryptocurrencies on their balance sheets isn’t entirely new, but it’s gaining significant momentum. Pioneers like MicroStrategy and Tesla paved the way, demonstrating that holding digital assets could be a viable, albeit volatile, component of a corporate treasury. But why the surge now, and why would a marketing technology provider like Aurora Mobile embrace such a strategy? Several factors are contributing to this trend: Inflationary Concerns: With global inflation remaining a persistent concern, traditional fiat currencies are losing purchasing power. Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are increasingly viewed by some as a hedge against inflation due to their decentralized nature and finite supply. Potential for High Growth: While volatile, the cryptocurrency market has shown immense growth potential over the past decade. Companies are looking to diversify their treasury holdings beyond low-yield traditional assets to potentially capture some of this upside. Technological Advancement & Innovation: Embracing digital assets can also signal a company’s commitment to innovation and its understanding of emerging technologies. For a marketing tech provider like Aurora Mobile, aligning with cutting-edge tech like blockchain can enhance its brand image and attract talent. Increasing Institutional Acceptance: The regulatory landscape is slowly but surely maturing, and more institutional players are entering the crypto space, lending legitimacy and infrastructure that makes corporate adoption more feasible. Yield Opportunities: Beyond simply holding, some advanced crypto treasury strategies explore yield-generating opportunities within decentralized finance (DeFi), though Aurora Mobile’s initial announcement focuses on direct allocation. What Does This Mean for Institutional Crypto Adoption? Aurora Mobile’s decision is a significant indicator of the accelerating pace of institutional crypto adoption . When a publicly traded company, particularly one outside the traditional finance or blockchain sectors, makes such a move, it sends a powerful signal to the broader market. It normalizes the idea of digital assets as legitimate components of a corporate balance sheet. Historically, institutions have been cautious due to regulatory uncertainty, volatility, and lack of robust infrastructure. However, as the ecosystem matures with clearer regulations, better custody solutions, and increasing liquidity, more institutions are finding ways to participate. This trend suggests: Increased Mainstream Acceptance: Each new corporate adoption chips away at the perception of crypto as a fringe asset, moving it closer to mainstream financial acceptance. Demand for Infrastructure: It will drive further demand for secure, compliant, and scalable solutions for institutional-grade crypto management, including custody, trading, and reporting tools. Market Stability: As more institutions enter, the market could potentially see greater stability over the long term, as institutional capital tends to be less reactive than retail speculation. A Closer Look at the Bitcoin Allocation and Ethereum Investment The specific cryptocurrencies chosen by Aurora Mobile for its treasury allocation are noteworthy. The inclusion of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) is almost a standard for any company venturing into crypto treasury management, given their market dominance and established ecosystems. Bitcoin (BTC) Allocation: The Digital Gold Standard Bitcoin’s role in a corporate treasury is often likened to digital gold. Its finite supply (21 million coins), decentralized nature, and long track record make it an attractive store of value. Companies opting for a Bitcoin allocation typically view it as a long-term hedge against inflation and a non-sovereign asset that diversifies their traditional fiat holdings. Its liquidity is unmatched in the crypto space, making it relatively easy to acquire and divest large sums. For Aurora Mobile, a Bitcoin allocation could be seen as a strategic move to preserve and potentially grow the value of its cash reserves in an unpredictable economic environment. Ethereum (ETH) Investment: Powering the Decentralized Future An Ethereum investment signals a slightly different strategic intent. While Bitcoin is primarily a store of value, Ethereum is the foundational layer for a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi protocols, NFTs, and Web3 innovations. Investing in ETH is an investment in the future of decentralized internet infrastructure and programmable money. For a marketing technology provider, an Ethereum investment could also be seen as an alignment with the very technologies that are shaping the next generation of digital engagement and commerce. It provides exposure to the growth of smart contracts and the burgeoning digital economy. Beyond BTC and ETH: Solana (SOL) and Sui (SUI) The inclusion of Solana (SOL) and Sui (SUI) in Aurora Mobile’s portfolio is particularly interesting. These are newer, high-performance Layer 1 blockchains designed to offer faster transaction speeds and lower costs compared to Ethereum (though Ethereum’s scalability is improving with upgrades like Ethereum 2.0). Solana (SOL): Known for its high throughput and low transaction fees, Solana has attracted a vibrant ecosystem of dApps, DeFi projects, and NFT marketplaces. Its inclusion suggests Aurora Mobile is looking for exposure to fast-growing, scalable blockchain platforms. Sui (SUI): As a relatively newer blockchain built by former Meta (Facebook) engineers, Sui is gaining traction for its object-centric model and parallel execution capabilities, aiming for extreme scalability. Investing in Sui shows a willingness to embrace emerging, high-potential technologies. This diversification beyond the top two cryptocurrencies indicates a more nuanced and potentially aggressive strategy, aiming to capture growth from promising newer ecosystems. Challenges and Considerations for Corporate Crypto Treasuries While the potential benefits are significant, corporate crypto treasury strategies are not without their challenges. Companies like Aurora Mobile must navigate a complex landscape: Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile. A 20% allocation means that a significant portion of a company’s treasury could see substantial fluctuations in value, impacting financial statements and potentially investor perception. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Changes in laws or new restrictions could impact the value or usability of digital assets. Security Risks: Holding digital assets requires robust security measures against hacking, theft, and loss of private keys. Custody solutions become paramount. Accounting and Tax Implications: The accounting treatment and tax implications of holding cryptocurrencies can be complex and vary by jurisdiction, requiring specialized expertise. Public Perception: While increasingly accepted, some traditional investors might view crypto allocations as overly risky, potentially affecting stock performance or investor relations. Companies embarking on this path typically engage specialized consultants, legal counsel, and robust internal controls to mitigate these risks. Actionable Insights for Businesses Considering Crypto For other companies observing Aurora Mobile’s move with interest, here are some actionable insights: Start Small and Learn: Instead of a large allocation, consider a smaller, experimental allocation to gain familiarity with the operational aspects, security protocols, and market dynamics. Define Your Objectives: Clearly articulate why you want to hold crypto. Is it for inflation hedge, growth, or strategic alignment with Web3? Your objectives will dictate your asset choices. Seek Expert Advice: Engage legal, tax, and financial advisors specializing in digital assets. This is not a DIY project for corporate treasuries. Implement Robust Security: Prioritize secure custody solutions, whether through third-party institutional custodians or highly secure self-custody practices. Educate Your Stakeholders: Prepare to communicate your strategy clearly to your board, investors, and employees, explaining the rationale and risk mitigation measures. The Future is Digital: Aurora Mobile Leading the Charge Aurora Mobile’s approval of a digital asset treasury strategy is more than just a financial decision; it’s a statement about the future of corporate finance and the increasing integration of digital assets into the global economy. By allocating a significant portion to Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Sui, Aurora Mobile is positioning itself at the forefront of a paradigm shift. This move highlights a growing confidence among corporations in the long-term viability and potential of the cryptocurrency market. As more companies follow suit, we can expect to see further maturation of the institutional infrastructure supporting digital assets, potentially leading to greater stability and broader acceptance. Aurora Mobile is not just investing in crypto; it’s investing in a vision of a more decentralized, digitally native future.

2025-06-25T15:00:52,"Coinbase And Secret Service Team Up In $225 Million Crypto Sting","Cryptocurrency firms and law enforcement teamed up this month in what could be the biggest crypto haul in US Secret Service history. On June 18, the Department of Justice moved to seize over $225 million in tokens linked to pig-butchering scams. This effort relied on blockchain tracing and quick action by exchanges and a stablecoin issuer to lock down funds that flowed through multiple platforms. Coinbase Joins Secret Service Effort According to Coinbase , its investigators worked alongside the US Secret Service during a focused sprint in early 2024. From February 26 to February 29, they tracked millions in suspect transfers and flagged transactions tied to illicit wallets. Based on reports, more than 130 Coinbase customers were hit by scams, collectively losing about $2.3 million. Agents then used subpoenaed records to tie those on-chain flows back to victim accounts. Coinbase also noted that some of the seized funds wound up in roughly 140 accounts at OKX, many held by people detained in scam compounds in Southeast Asia. Coinbase helped drive a major law enforcement win: the U.S. Secret Service has seized $225M in stolen crypto tied to pig butchering scams—and is returning funds to victims. If you think you were affected, you may be eligible for restitution. Learn more: https://t.co/0VirllyzM7 — Coinbase Support (@CoinbaseSupport) June 24, 2025 Tether Freezes And Burns USDT According to Tether, 39 wallet addresses were frozen after the DOJ presented evidence of theft. Those wallets held about $225 million in USDT. Tether then performed a burn, sending tokens to an inaccessible address so they could never be spent again. At the same time, an equal amount of fresh USDT was minted and sent to a wallet under Secret Service control. Observers could watch that swap on-chain, showing how stablecoins can be pulled out of circulation when needed to cut off illicit actors. Record Seizure Marks New High According to information from the DOJ, this move represents the largest crypto seizure ever attributed to the Secret Service . It comes after a surge in pig-butchering scams —long-con frauds where operators befriend victims online and convince them to invest in fake schemes. Law enforcement described this case as a landmark in fighting crypto crime, stressing that on-chain data was critical in pinpointing stolen funds scattered across different exchanges. Global Actions And Next Steps Beyond the US, similar actions have popped up around the globe. In May, the Australian Federal Police seized nearly 25 Bitcoin—worth about $2.6 million—from suspects tied to a 2013 hack of a French exchange. And in February, German authorities blasted 34 million euros ($38 million) in crypto linked to a massive Bybit breach . Analysts say these joint efforts send a clear message: crypto doesn’t equal anonymity. Investors ought to stay alert about unsolicited investment offers.

2025-06-25T14:53:57,"BNB Moonshot: Nano Labs Issues $500M Notes for Token Grab","Chinese Web3 hardware and infrastructure company Nano Labs has put the crypto and equity markets in overdrive, announcing a $500 million convertible notes deal to start a billion-dollar Binance Coin (BNB) treasury program. The deal, which could see Nano Labs acquiring up to 10% of all outstanding circulating BNB supply, pushed its shares listed on Nasdaq over 100% higher in a day. Deal Structure: Convertible Notes and Daring Treasury Shift Nano Labs begins its strategy with the offering of $500 million of unsecured convertible promissory notes that will come due in 360 days with no interest. Convertible note investors may convert their holdings into Nano Labs' Class A ordinary shares at a conversion price of $20 a share—nearly twice the stock's close before the news. Unless converted, the principal is paid at maturity. The company will fund the balance of its $1 billion BNB war chest through private placements, one of the largest altcoin treasury plans ever undertaken by a public company. The deal is not done but will settle on standard terms, with several investors already pledging to subscribe. Nano Labs' management confirms the deal is a major milestone in its strategic growth, with BNB now at the centre of its digital asset reserve. Why BNB Over Bitcoin? A Strategic Shift Nano Labs' move is the anomaly in an ocean of corporate treasuries that have been focused on Bitcoin. The company, which had $5.5 million in BTC beforehand, now looks to BNB, relating to the token's visibility as a leading asset on the Binance platform and its growing applicability to Web3 and DeFi. Executives believe BNB's utility, network effects, and entrenchment among Binance's $14B daily trade volume make it a reserve asset that is future-proof. This play is an altcoin adoption bet too. As one analyst speculated, ”Institutions have been overexposed to Bitcoin—Nano Labs is signaling a new era of diversified crypto treasuries.” The play tracks increased institutional demand for BNB with other hedge funds rumored to be establishing reserve plays. BNB Liquidity and Price Outlook Nano Labs' aggressive accumulation could have profound implications for BNB's liquidity and price. The business plans to accumulate 5% to 10% of all outstanding supply of BNB—up to 9.4 million tokens, worth billions at current prices. Such accumulation can strangle supply, drive prices higher, and increase volatility, especially if other corporates follow suit. BNB picked up by 2.7% on the news, while Nano Labs' shares doubled, rising to $29 before settling close to $15. Market players are now awaiting to see if this will trigger a cross-the-board altcoin treasury move, as companies seek something other than keeping reserves in Bitcoin. Though the arrangement has charged markets, it has risks attached to it. The notes are not secured, and the completion of the deal is not certain. Regulator scrutiny may increase, particularly as more public companies move towards altcoin treasuries. Nano Labs states it will undertake a complete evaluation of BNB's security and worth before scaling up its holdings, in an effort to alleviate the concerns of investors as well as regulators. Bottom Line Nano Labs' $500 million convertible notes move is an altcoin treasuries watermark and institutional crypto onboarding. If successful, it has the potential to shake up the BNB market, encourage other firms to diversify out of Bitcoin, and mark the beginning of a new age for institutional crypto reserves—one where the world's largest tokens compete for a spot on the corporate balance sheet.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9705/bnb-moonshot-nano-labs-issues-500-m-notes-for-token-grab,"ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|BNB","News|Altcoins",cryptocompare

2025-06-25T14:51:47,"Leading Crypto Senator Sees End of Year as U.S. Legislation Target","WASHINGTON, D.C. — In the wake of the U.S. Senate passing its first major crypto bill, one of the industry chief proponents there, Senator Cynthia Lummis, said the final step toward U.S. regulations for the crypto sector may take several more months to complete, potentially skipping past the August deadline set by President Donald Trump. The Senate's recent approval of stablecoin legislation is just one of many steps that potentially remain in turning two related efforts — also including the push toward new rules to govern U.S. digital asset markets — into U.S. law. When asked for a realistic timeline on this year's crypto efforts, Lummis told a Bitcoin Policy Institute audience in Washington , ""I think before the end of this calendar year"" for finishing all of the related legislation. The Wyoming Republican said she'd be ""extremely disappointed"" if that wasn't the case. ""We're in a good place,"" she said at the Wednesday event. But the chairwoman of the Senate Banking Committee's digital assets subcommittee also led a hearing on Tuesday to make a first foray into discussion of market structure legislation in that chamber, acknowledging it won't be easy. She hinted at the delicacy of the bipartisan wave that helped drive 18 Democratic votes (for 68 total) on the stablecoin bill last week, which she equated to ""a tooth-pulling exercise."" At her Tuesday hearing, a shortage of Democrats showed up to question witnesses, and she made some remarks at the end revealing her awareness the parties are approaching the effort differently. ""I don't want to come up with a piece of legislation that the other side of the aisle feels they haven't had adequate input in, and so that is going to require maybe me to go out of my way to pursue additional discussions directly with the other side of the aisle,"" she said, questioning how the pursuit of crypto legislation became divisive. ""It was very bipartisan then and now it seems not to be, and I don't understand what's changed, at least with regard to this topic."" Some Democratic lawmakers have demanded that Congress needs to insist in these bills that senior government officials, including the president, not be allowed to directly engage in crypto businesses. While Republican lawmakers have generally shied away from openly discussing the criticism that Trump's involvement amounts to federal government corruption, Lummis nodded toward that view on Tuesday. ""Maybe this is about concern that certain people that have family members in the administration are going to be advantaged in some way by what we're doing,"" she said. ""I don't want that to be the case. I want everybody to be advantaged."" She noted at the Wednesday event that there was — at one point of the stablecoin debate in the Senate — a setback with the Democratic supporters, who hit the brakes to criticize some of the bill's security provisions and also the potential conflicts of Trump's personal crypto interests. Those Democrats, including Senator Ruben Gallego, did come around later. But it's so far unclear how much those lawmakers will press for the market structure effort to ban government officials from crypto and whether that would be a deal breaker for Republicans. At this point, the U.S. House of Representatives has been in the lead on crypto market structure, having passed its Digital Asset Market Clarity Act from two committees on its way toward the House floor. But it now has to fix on a strategy for how it may or may not fold the stablecoin effort into that bill or pursue it separately. One option is to simply sign off on the Senate's Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, which would send that piece to Trump more immediately, as he requested in a recent social-media post . The Senate remains the highest hurdle for U.S. legislation, so any House successes will run into the need to win wide Democratic support in the Senate.

2025-06-25T14:49:00,"Best Crypto to Buy Now as Trump's New Executive Order Will Force Banks to Adopt Cryptocurrency","The latest executive order drafted by Donald Trump’s team could be the most consequential move for crypto adoption in years. If signed, the order would prevent American banks from refusing service to individuals or companies simply because they are involved in the cryptocurrency space. For years, traditional financial institutions have maintained distance, if not outright hostility, toward crypto. Now they will no longer have the legal cover to do so. Banks would be required to engage with digital asset firms in the same way they do with any other legal industry. What was once a fringe sector is now being positioned within the standard financial framework. If executed as planned, the order will force the old guard to sit at the same table as blockchain innovators, accelerating adoption not by speculation but through structural change. Trump’s Executive Order Could Finally End the ‘Debanking’ Era for Crypto in the U.S. Trump’s upcoming executive order speculation, as made in a WSJ report , directly targets what many in the industry have described as a coordinated effort to squeeze crypto out of the financial system. This effort, which has been unofficially labeled Operation Chokepoint 2.0, saw banks quietly sever ties with blockchain startups, payment processors, and even prominent executives, often citing “reputational risk” as justification. But that justification no longer holds. The Federal Reserve has now removed “reputational risk” from its bank supervision protocols, a technical but significant shift that clears the way for new regulatory clarity. 🔥 🇺🇸 JUST IN: President Trump's admin may issue executive order to stop banks from cutting off crypto firms, aiming to end “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” per WSJ. — {Matt} $XRPatriot (@matttttt187) June 24, 2025 The proposed order would go a step further. It would authorize penalties for banks that engage in politically motivated discrimination, effectively forcing them to treat crypto like any other regulated industry. High-level meetings between major banks and GOP state officials have already taken place, as traditional institutions begin to recalibrate for a different kind of White House stance. Meanwhile, Trump’s broader deregulation push, which is already targeting legacy rules like SAB 121 and DeFi reporting mandates, adds further momentum to the shift. The crypto sector, once sidelined, is now being welcomed back into the fold of American finance. The impact on legitimacy, funding access, and innovation could be profound. Investors are watching not for speculative mania this time but for structural alignment that could finally give crypto the stability it has long lacked. Since the news of a ceasefire and such pro-crypto developments has come out, investors seem to have also been showing major interest, which caused Bitcoin to jump from the lower $100K levels to over $106K at a quick pace, allowing most investors to speculate another market pump soon. Best Crypto to Buy Now That May Pump As Trump’s Order May Go Live Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper has been created as a foundational reimagining of what Bitcoin could become if freed from its structural limitations. While Bitcoin remains the gold standard for store of value, it is practically unusable for developers who want to build fast, scalable applications. Bitcoin Hyper bridges that divide by introducing a fully operational Layer 2 network that runs on Solana’s virtual machine while anchoring security to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work base layer. This setup means that wrapped BTC can now be deployed in real DeFi environments, with sub-second finality and fees that cost less than a fraction of a cent. The network itself runs on zero-knowledge rollups that compress Layer 2 activity and submit them back to Bitcoin for final settlement, preserving decentralization while enabling modern functionality. Smart contracts, meme tokens, DEXs, and even gaming apps can now use Bitcoin as their settlement base. This is not merely theoretical; the chain is live, with staking active and tokenized incentives already in motion. Several popular creators including ClayBro and many others have already endorsed the project, in an attempt to highlight its potential as an undervalued gem in the recent weeks too. As banks begin to reenter the digital asset sector, projects like Bitcoin Hyper stand to benefit disproportionately. Financial institutions typically look for credible infrastructure and scalable frameworks, and Bitcoin Hyper offers both. It is not a meme narrative, it is a developer’s toolkit tied to the world’s most secure blockchain. If the new order from the White House unlocks traditional capital flows, Bitcoin Hyper could become one of the few Bitcoin-native ecosystems ready to absorb real volume. SUBBD SUBBD is what social platforms should have evolved into if they were designed from scratch by creators, not corporations. It is a content monetization network where creators can build their own subscription-driven ecosystems while retaining full autonomy. Instead of relying on algorithms and ad revenue, creators earn directly from subscribers through a blockchain-native model that supports access gating, limited-content NFTs, livestream tokenization, and identity control. The underlying architecture allows creators to build their own micro-economies without needing third-party intermediaries. Whether it is a newsletter, a video course, or a podcast, each piece of content can be embedded into a smart contract that automatically governs access and payment. That kind of infrastructure does not just make monetization easier—it gives creators a business model that can scale globally without legal or geographic bottlenecks. With banks soon being required to serve crypto-native businesses, platforms like SUBBD might finally receive the payment rails and institutional integrations they have long lacked. That access could unlock on-ramps for fiat subscriptions, international payouts, and creator lending. These additions would give SUBBD the kind of legitimacy and usability that Web2 platforms enjoy, while retaining its Web3 foundations. As the executive order forces banking institutions to re-evaluate how they interact with crypto platforms, utility-led projects like SUBBD may find themselves on the frontline of adoption. Its appeal lies not in hype but in the architecture of how creators, platforms, and audiences connect. Best Wallet Token The Best Wallet Token sits at the center of a wallet ecosystem that is far more than just a digital vault. This platform is built to function as a comprehensive identity and interaction layer for the everyday crypto user. Through a single dashboard, users can manage portfolios, sign into decentralized apps, interact with blockchain games, and even access token-gated experiences. The token itself underpins this activity by powering fee discounts, staking rewards, and governance access. But what makes Best Wallet Token’s utility stand out is its push toward on-chain reputation. Rather than relying solely on seed phrases or cold storage, users can attach verifiable credentials to their wallets, including transaction histories, social badges, or even DAO voting records. This transforms the wallet from a simple container to a verifiable identity passport across blockchain platforms. If Trump’s executive order is enacted, and banks are indeed compelled to treat crypto services like any other industry, wallet infrastructure projects could find themselves being evaluated by fintech companies, lenders, and even compliance partners. A token like BEST, which represents access to a real identity layer within Web3, would be uniquely positioned to thrive in that scenario. 🔥 Over $13M Raised and Counting! 🔥Best Wallet is becoming the go-to for traders who want speed, simplicity, and early access to what matters:✅ Buy new tokens early, directly in-app✅ Buy and bridge across chains in one place✅ Full portfolio control, no clutterDownload… pic.twitter.com/0SDNVPov6v — Best Wallet (@BestWalletHQ) June 4, 2025 Instead of being yet another wallet token, it offers utility that anticipates a world where crypto users need verifiable, interoperable identities to navigate an increasingly integrated financial web. That puts it ahead of the curve and ready for an era where institutions no longer stand at the gate but are finally stepping through. Snorter Snorter is a specialized trading bot designed for the Solana ecosystem, but unlike most bots that focus on technical indicators or basic arbitrage, Snorter’s core strength lies in behavioral triggers. It uses real-time transaction monitoring across Solana’s memecoin pools to detect shifts in momentum before they fully register on conventional charts. This includes wallet clustering, liquidity inflow patterns, presale bridging, and social signal extraction tied to on-chain behavior. What makes Snorter uniquely relevant right now is its focus on how narrative-based tokens behave in short bursts of attention and capital. It does not just trade volatility but also anticipates where attention is going and executes across DEXs at low latency. The bot can be fine-tuned based on risk thresholds, whitelist participation, and exposure caps, making it appealing for users who want to participate in fast-moving memecoin markets without spending 20 hours a day tracking Discord and Telegram. As mainstream banking begins to accept crypto infrastructure again, the tools that help retail traders navigate these markets efficiently could gain more traction. More capital, more users, and more legitimacy usually mean higher noise, and tools like Snorter could evolve into critical layers that simplify decision-making. If this new wave of institutional openness brings fresh liquidity into Solana-based ecosystems, Snorter is well-positioned to become not just a utility tool, but a foundational service for retail-driven trading behavior. Conclusion Forcing banks to open their doors to crypto clients removes one of the last institutional roadblocks. It essentially takes crypto from resistance to integration, from exclusion to infrastructure. And when traditional finance begins to merge with blockchain, the upside lies not just in market sentiment but in practical adoption. That is where real value begins to form. The right projects such as the ones above, especially those built with long-term utility in mind, could benefit tremendously from this shift. Now is the window to position early, before structural clarity turns into mainstream acceleration. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

2025-06-25T14:40:14,"Ledger Live rolls out MEV-optimized ETH Yields in Chorus One tie-up","Two of crypto’s most trusted names just made Ethereum staking simpler and potentially more rewarding. By embedding MEV Max directly into Ledger Live, they’re cutting out the inefficiencies that plague traditional staking setups. According to a June 25 press release shared with crypto.news, Ledger has integrated Chorus One’s MEV Max Vault into its Ledger Live platform, allowing users to stake Ethereum ( ETH ) with MEV-boosted rewards directly from their hardware wallets. The move allows Ledger users to access Chorus One’s high-performance staking infrastructure natively through the “Earn” and “Discover” sections of the app. It eliminates the need for third-party dashboards or manual delegation, wrapping staking, MEV extraction, and security into a single interface. For Ledger’s millions of users, it’s a frictionless upgrade that could shift how retail investors approach Ethereum staking. You might also like: SharpLink strengthens ETH bet with additional $30.6M purchase Does this integration change the staking game ? For years, Ethereum staking has been a trade-off between convenience and optimization. Solo stakers chase MEV rewards through complex setups, while retail investors settle for basic yields from centralized platforms. Ledger and Chorus One’s integration disrupts that dichotomy by merging institutional-grade strategies with retail-friendly access, all without compromising self-custody. Per the statement, Chorus One’s MEV Max combines advanced infrastructure with proprietary research to maximize validator rewards. The system optimizes block proposals through close collaboration with Ethereum block builders, strategically selecting transactions to enhance staker returns. This approach has already delivered notable results, including two blocks this year yielding 159.9 ETH and 134 ETH, respectively, significantly outperforming typical staking rewards. The mechanics are straightforward but powerful. Users stake ETH through Ledger Live’s interface, and Chorus One’s validators bundle transactions to maximize MEV opportunities while sharing profits with stakers. As more users participate, the growing total value locked increases the pool’s block proposal frequency, creating a network effect where larger stakes can lead to more consistent rewards. Importantly, all this occurs without requiring users to manage validators or understand MEV complexities. The current integration is merely phase one. According to the release, Ledger and Chorus One are already exploring looped staking and osETH minting. osETH is a liquid staking token enabling re-staking and DeFi participation without unlocking ETH.

2025-06-25T14:36:46,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Extends Gains, Crosses $107,000","Bitcoin (BTC) extended its gains to cross $107,000 as the crypto market surged again. The flagship cryptocurrency was buoyed by easing geopolitical tensions as President Donald Trump announced that Israel and Iran had reached a ceasefire agreement. Institutional interest and sustained whale activity have also helped prices push higher. BTC is up nearly 2% over the past 24 hours, trading around $107,050. Bitcoin (BTC) And Crypto Markets Rise The crypto market cap is up nearly 1% in the past 24 hours as Bitcoin (BTC) extended its gains for a third day to reclaim $107,000. BTC regained $105,000 at the beginning of the week, rebounding from a low of $98,385 on Sunday. Bullish sentiment returned on Monday following the ceasefire announcement, as BTC rose over 4% to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,442. The likely catalyst for BTC’s latest rally is easing tensions in the Middle East. US President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran and urged both countries to respect it. The ceasefire announcement was made after US B2 aircraft targeted Iran’s nuclear facilities. The airstrikes prompted a symbolic response by Iran, which struck a US base in Qatar. However, it reportedly gave the US ample warning, allowing it to evacuate personnel and avoid major escalation. The ceasefire brought relief to traders as a full-blown conflict could have destabilized the global economy and sent prices skyrocketing. Iran also threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, which sees around 20% of the global oil supply pass through it. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Near Two-Week Inflow Streak US spot Bitcoin ETFs continued to attract inflows as geopolitical tensions eased, nearing a two-week inflow streak. According to data from SoSoValue, US spot Bitcoin ETFs registered a combined $588.5 million in inflows on June 24. This was the strongest single-day performance in over a month, extending the current streak of inflows to 11 days. The ETFs have registered over $3.3 billion in inflows since the streak began. Not surprisingly, BlackRock’s IBIT led the daily inflow chart with $436.32 million in inflows, accounting for nearly three-quarters of the daily total. Fidelity’s FBTC registered $85.16 million in inflows, while ARK Invest’s ARKB registered $43.85 million. Meanwhile, Bitwise’s BITB, Grayscale’s GBTC, and VanEck’s HODL collectively registered $23.22 million in inflows. However, smaller funds did not register any inflows on the day. The spike in inflows was driven by easing tensions in the Middle East after Israel and Iran agreed to a ceasefire. Anthony Pompliano’s Crypto Venture Purchases 3,724 BTC Crypto entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano’s firm ProCap has announced its first Bitcoin purchase days after revealing its plan to go public later this year. The firm said Tuesday it purchased 3,724 BTC for $386 million. The company’s holdings are worth just shy of $400 million at current prices, with BTC gaining since the purchase. ProCap released a statement announcing the purchase, stating, “American investor and entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano today announced that ProCap BTC , LLC, a bitcoin-native financial services firm (the “Company”) has purchased 3,724 bitcoin at a time-weighted average price (""TWAP"") of $103,785 per bitcoin, following the Company’s June 23, 2025 announcement of a proposed $1 billion business combination with Columbus Circle Capital Corp. The bitcoin was acquired as part of the Company’s ongoing Bitcoin purchase program.” ProCap plans to purchase $1 billion worth of Bitcoin as part of its ongoing business strategy. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) reclaimed $107,000 as it extended its gains for a third consecutive day. The flagship cryptocurrency faced considerable selling pressure over the weekend as the Middle East conflict escalated, falling 1.17% on Saturday. Bearish sentiment increased on Sunday after the US carried out airstrikes on key Iranian sites, prompting a symbolic retaliation. As a result, BTC plunged below $100,000, falling to $98,385 before recovering to reclaim $100,000 and settling at $100,982. However, President Trump announced a ceasefire, boosting market sentiment. As a result, BTC rallied on Monday, rising over 4% to cross $100,000 and settle at $105,442. Analysts believe BTC is primed to move past $110,000 after the latest exchange order book data from CoinGlass showed prime conditions for a new round of “liquidity grabs” up to $111,000. Popular trader and analyst Mark Cullen stated, “I wouldn't be surprised to see $BTC push a little higher into the 107K's before pulling back and taking the liquidity below 105-104K with a quick wick.” Another trader noticed that upside liquidity around current all-time highs had become significant relative to that sitting below price. This, according to the analyst, increased the odds of a move higher. “Downside liquidity is completely taken out. $111,000 looks eager to be tagged next. New all-time highs - sooner than you think?” Meanwhile, Trader Skew, another prominent analyst, flagged $103,000 as a key level in the event of a downside liquidity grab. “Currently, the market is pretty neutral in terms of positioning, longs opening targeting higher & shorts opening here as hedges. The more liquidity that gets attracted here = The greater the reaction.” BTC started the previous week on a bullish note, rising 1.18% to cross the 20-day SMA and settle at $106,808, but not before reaching an intraday high of $108,939. However, BTC lost momentum on Tuesday, falling over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and $105,000 and settling at $104,519. The price recovered on Wednesday, rising 0.35%, but was back in the red on Thursday, registering a marginal decline and settling at $104,631. BTC raced to an intraday high of $106,513 but lost momentum after reaching this level. As a result, it fell 1.18%, slipping below the 50-day SMA and settling at $103,388. Source: TradingView Sellers retained control on Saturday as BTC fell 1.17% to $102,180, but not before dropping to an intraday low of $100,979. The price plunged below $100,000 on Sunday, falling to a low of $98,385 as markets tumbled after US airstrikes on Iran. However, BTC recovered from this level to reclaim $100,000 and settle at $100,982. Market sentiment flipped to bullish on Monday after Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. As a result, BTC surged over 4% to reclaim $105,000 and move to $105,442. The price continued to push higher on Tuesday, rising 0.66% to cross the 20 and 50-day SMAs, reclaim $106,000, and settle at $106,138. The current session sees BTC up nearly 2%, trading around $107,990. If bullish sentiment persists, the price could push to $110,000-$111,000.

Table of Contents MSTR’s S&P 500 eligibility now hinges on Bitcoin stability Why Bitcoin’s history favors Strategy’s odds New rules changed the game, but Q1 timing was off If MSTR joins, Bitcoin quietly enters the S&P MSTR’s S&P 500 eligibility now hinges on Bitcoin stability Michael Saylor ’s corporate bet on Bitcoin ( BTC ) may be approaching a new milestone. If Bitcoin holds its current price level, Strategy (MSTR), formerly known as MicroStrategy, could soon meet the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the S&P 500 index. The potential inclusion depends on a specific financial threshold tied to reported earnings. According to financial analyst Jeff Walton, the probability of Strategy meeting that requirement now stands at 91%. 91% chance of $MSTR qualifying for S&P in 6 days https://t.co/uGkzAuTQ2Y — Jeff Walton (@PunterJeff) June 24, 2025 Walton estimates that Bitcoin would need to fall below $95,240 before the end of June to push Strategy’s Q2 earnings below the qualifying line. Based on current pricing, that would require a drop of more than 10% within a matter of days. As of Jun. 23, the company holds 592,345 bitcoins at an average acquisition cost of $70,666, with a total outlay of approximately $41.84 billion. With Bitcoin trading at $107,213 on Jun. 25, the value of the company’s crypto holdings exceeds $63.5 billion. These unrealized gains play a direct role in Strategy’s reported earnings, which are the final factor under review for S&P 500 inclusion. Why Bitcoin’s history favors Strategy’s odds Walton arrived at the 91% probability by analyzing Bitcoin’s historical price behavior across 3,928 rolling six-day trading windows between September 2014 and June 2025. “Going back to September 17, 2014, over any six-day period, the price of Bitcoin has dropped more than 10% only 343 times,” Walton said in a recent broadcast. “There have been 3,585 periods where it hasn’t dropped more than 10%. So 8.7% of those periods saw that kind of decline.” Based on that breakdown, the chance of Bitcoin remaining above the threshold needed for Strategy’s Q2 earnings to qualify is roughly 91.3%. To validate the number against recent conditions, Walton filtered the same six-day windows starting from the launch of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which he sees as a structural turning point in the market. Since the introduction of IBIT, Bitcoin has avoided a 10% or greater drop in 96.6% of all comparable periods, suggesting that in a more mature environment shaped by institutional involvement and ETF flows, sharp declines have become less frequent. Time is also a factor. With each passing day, the quarter’s end approaches, and the window for a large short-term drop narrows further. According to Walton, even if Bitcoin were to decline to $104,000 instead of $95,000, the required percentage drop would shrink to 8.42%. That would raise the risk modestly but still keep it well within historically favorable territory. If Bitcoin remains range-bound or climbs further, the likelihood of Strategy meeting the S&P earnings threshold continues to rise. Other requirements for index inclusion are already in place. Strategy’s market cap now exceeds $21 billion, and its average daily trading volume is well above the minimum needed for S&P 500 eligibility. That leaves net income as the only unresolved criterion. With just a few trading days remaining in the quarter, the numbers appear to lean clearly in Strategy’s favor. New rules changed the game, but Q1 timing was off Strategy’s path toward S&P 500 inclusion did not begin in Q2. The company was already in contention during the first quarter of 2025, having satisfied most structural requirements, including market capitalization, liquidity, and listing standards. One condition, however, remained unresolved: net profitability over the trailing twelve months. To meet that standard, the company needed Q1 earnings strong enough to offset earlier losses and deliver a positive cumulative figure across four quarters. The turning point came with the adoption of a revised accounting rule issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Under the new standard, companies holding digital assets must recognize them at fair market value, allowing unrealized gains to contribute directly to reported net income. The previous method only captured impairments, excluding any upside from price increases. For firms like Strategy, with large bitcoin holdings, the change significantly altered how market performance translated into earnings. Despite the rule’s introduction, timing remained critical. Bitcoin’s closing price at the end of the quarter ultimately determined whether Strategy could clear the profitability bar. Analyst Richard Hass estimated that the company required $1.113 billion in Q1 net income to meet the S&P earnings condition. That figure would have been achievable only if bitcoin closed above $96,337 on Mar. 31, based on Strategy’s then-total of 478,740 BTC. ⭕️ $MSTR 'Strategy' FASB / S&P500 Inclusion Update 🧐 TLDR: PER 24Q4 EARNINGS, STRATEGY IS ELIGIBLE FOR SPX IF BTC IS >$96,374 ON MARCH 31, 2025 WITHOUT ACQUIRING ANY MORE BITCOIN. —————————- ✅The Facts: Post 24Q4 Earnings we can now calculate the… https://t.co/4LJYbY3loz pic.twitter.com/pJInv95eSY — Richard Haas (@RichardAHaas) February 6, 2025 However, Bitcoin closed the quarter at $82,548, falling short of the mark. Hence, the fair value rule did improve reported earnings and the final price left a sizable gap between valuation and the level needed to offset previous losses. Strategy had reported a $671 million net loss in Q4 2024, primarily due to the old accounting rule that marked bitcoin down to below $16,000 per coin, even though it ended the year trading above $94,000. That discrepancy left the company with a steep earnings deficit heading into Q1, and the new rule, while helpful, was not enough to overcome it. If MSTR joins, Bitcoin quietly enters the S&P If Strategy enters the S&P 500, MSTR would become a vehicle for bringing Bitcoin into mainstream equity portfolios without needing any formal crypto approval. The company would then be evaluated not only as a proxy for Bitcoin exposure but also as a listed firm expected to meet broader financial and governance standards. Around $15.6 trillion in global assets are benchmarked to the S&P 500, with approximately $7.1 trillion held in index funds that replicate its composition. Once Strategy qualifies, these funds would be required to allocate a portion of their capital to MSTR shares. That mechanism creates an indirect but significant channel through which traditional asset managers, many of whom are restricted from holding Bitcoin itself, gain price exposure through equity ownership. Even a 0.01% allocation across S&P-linked assets would translate into more than $1.5 billion in fresh demand for MSTR stock. The effect on Bitcoin would be slower but meaningful. If MSTR becomes a core holding across major equity funds, Bitcoin’s alignment with traditional asset classes could strengthen. As of Jun. 25, Strategy holds roughly 2.8% of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply. Any increase in MSTR demand driven by index buying would reinforce Bitcoin’s role as a macro-linked asset, responding not only to crypto cycles but also to broader movements in equity markets. It would also reshape how Strategy is viewed. Since its strategic pivot in 2020, the company has traded more like a Bitcoin ETF than a legacy software business. S&P 500 inclusion, however, would place Strategy in a peer group defined by consistent revenues, dividend payouts, and sector-specific exposures. That new positioning would raise expectations around financial reporting, operational stability, and corporate discipline. It would also bring more frequent index reviews and potential weighting adjustments, especially if volatility remains elevated. A useful comparison is Tesla ’s S&P 500 entry in December 2020. The company attracted over $80 billion in flows as passive and active managers adjusted their positions. Its correlation with the broader market rose sharply in the months that followed. While Strategy’s market cap is much smaller, its high beta to Bitcoin could make it a functional bridge between digital assets and legacy capital markets. That bridge may prove more important as crypto edges closer to regulatory clarity and standardized accounting treatment. If MSTR joins the index, Bitcoin effectively enters with it. That alters who holds exposure, how it is classified, and where it fits within the larger financial system.",crypto_news,https://crypto.news/mstr-sp-500-entry-bitcoin-exposure-91-chance/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING","Feature|Bitcoin|michael saylor|MicroStrategy",cryptocompare

In a new Bloomberg report, JPMorgan Chase says Asian technology stocks may put up between 15% and 20% gains during the remainder of 2025, largely due to artificial intelligence (AI). Say JPMorgan Chase analysts, “AI will continue to lead this upcycle on the growth in datacenter capex (capital expenditures) in 2025 and more confidence in 2026 growth. We are not advising any meaningful rotation away from AI stocks in the next three months.” One metric indicating significant AI demand in the region is the Bloomberg Asia Pacific Semiconductors Index, a gauge of semiconductor companies in the Asia Pacific region, which has risen over 12% this year. The semiconductor index outperformed Bloomberg’s MSCI AC Asia Pacific Index, an Asian equity gauge. JPMorgan’s analysts predict that shares of the region’s largest chipmakers, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., SK Hynix Inc., Advantest Corp and Delta Electronics Inc., will continue to increase for at least the next 12 months and company earnings will continue to see upward revisions. Meanwhile, JPMorgan analysts are leaning bearish on non-AI stocks, including manufacturers of personal computers, smartphones and consumer devices, predicting these companies may see further downward earnings revisions due to the fading impact of China consumption subsidies.

Bitcoin ETFs: Institutional Capital Defies Geopolitical Storm While Bitcoin initially sold off alongside global equities when Israel launched late-night airstrikes against Iran , with Tehran responding in kind, the digital asset’s recovery above $100,000, coupled with sustained ETF demand, suggests institutions are increasingly treating Bitcoin as a portfolio diversifier rather than a risk-on speculation. YouHodler’s head of risk, Sergei Gorev, recently noted that while gold initially captured safe-haven flows, Bitcoin’s recovery indicates markets don’t “firmly believe in the active development of the Iran-Israel conflict phase,” with declining dollar strength benefiting both precious metals and cryptocurrencies.
