2025-06-25T13:41:35,"Here’s What 1 XRP Will Be Worth If It Has the Same Market Cap As Bitcoin","In a recent post on X, crypto analyst Amonyx sparked renewed interest in XRP’s potential by stating: “Did you know? If $XRP had the same market cap as $BTC, 1 XRP would be worth over $35.” This simple comparison underscores the relationship between market capitalization and token supply—two critical metrics that determine a cryptocurrency’s price. The Numbers Behind the Comparison As of report time, Bitcoin’s market capitalization is approximately $2.14 trillion, with a circulating supply of about 19.9 million BTC. In contrast, XRP has a circulating supply of roughly 58.94 billion tokens and a market cap near $130 billion. By dividing Bitcoin’s market cap by XRP’s circulating supply, $36.31 per XRP is obtained. This confirms Amonyx’s statement— if XRP matched Bitcoin’s market cap, each XRP would be worth over $35 . With XRP currently trading around $2.19, this scenario would reflect a price increase of more than 1,500%. Did you know? If $XRP had the same market cap as $BTC , 1 XRP would be worth over $35. pic.twitter.com/BeZRBPDlmw — Amonyx (@amonbuy) June 25, 2025 Rising Institutional Interest and Market Momentum Beyond the numbers, XRP continues to gain traction among institutions and policymakers. In March 2025, President Donald Trump signed an executive order officially recognizing a group of digital assets as part of the U.S. strategic crypto reserve. Among them were XRP, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano, a significant endorsement of XRP’s growing institutional relevance. Ripple, the company behind XRP, has long focused on developing blockchain-based payment infrastructure. Its collaborations with global financial institutions and central banks have reinforced XRP’s role in real-time cross-border settlement. This practical utility has helped XRP remain a top contender in blockchain finance. Additionally, there is increasing discussion around the creation of XRP-backed exchange-traded products (ETPs). While no XRP spot ETF has been approved yet , the success of Bitcoin ETFs has intensified demand for broader crypto-based investment vehicles. Regulatory developments could eventually open the door for institutional-grade XRP investment products. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 One of XRP’s standout advantages is its energy efficiency. According to verified network data, each XRP transaction consumes only 0.0079 kWh, compared to over 700 kWh per Bitcoin transaction. In a world increasingly focused on sustainability, XRP’s low energy profile strengthens its appeal to ESG-conscious investors and institutions. Amonyx’s statement that 1 XRP would be worth over $35 if it had the same market cap as Bitcoin is mathematically accurate. The comparison provides a clear, data-driven perspective on XRP’s price to its supply and potential valuation. While no forecast is implied, the analysis underscores the importance of XRP’s ongoing growth, institutional adoption, and efficient design. As conversations around regulation, utility, and institutional access continue to evolve, XRP remains a digital asset with one of the most compelling value propositions in the market today.

2025-06-25T13:40:43,"Bitcoin’s Astonishing Demand: Analyst Reveals Crucial Exchange Ratio Insights","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Astonishing Demand: Analyst Reveals Crucial Exchange Ratio Insights Are you keeping a close eye on Bitcoin’s pulse? In the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, discerning genuine market signals from mere noise is paramount. Recent insights from a prominent crypto analyst have shed light on a fascinating metric that could be a strong indicator of where Bitcoin is headed next: the exchange inflow/outflow ratio. This particular metric is offering a compelling narrative of sustained Bitcoin demand , reminiscent of past bullish phases. Decoding the BTC Exchange Ratio: What Does It Mean for Bitcoin Demand ? Understanding the flow of Bitcoin onto and off exchanges is like peering into the collective psychology of the market. When more Bitcoin flows onto exchanges, it often signals an intent to sell, increasing supply and potentially putting downward pressure on prices. Conversely, when Bitcoin flows *off* exchanges, it typically suggests accumulation and holding, indicating strong buying interest and reduced selling pressure. This is precisely where the BTC exchange ratio comes into play. Crypto analyst Axel Adler Jr. recently highlighted a crucial development on X (formerly Twitter). He pointed out that the 30-day simple moving average (SMA) of Bitcoin’s exchange inflow/outflow ratio has reached 1.125. But what does this number truly signify? Ratio above 1: This means that for every unit of BTC flowing out of exchanges, 1.125 units are flowing in. While at first glance this might seem like more supply, the context is key. When this ratio is high *and* sustained, especially after a period of accumulation, it suggests that new demand is entering the market, potentially outpacing the supply available for immediate sale. Historical Context: Adler Jr. specifically noted that this level is “akin to that at the beginning of the late 2023 bull run.” This comparison is vital. The late 2023 period saw significant price appreciation for Bitcoin, driven by renewed interest and institutional anticipation. The current ratio suggests a similar underlying strength in demand. Implication: A sustained high ratio, particularly one that echoes previous bullish periods, strongly implies that market participants are actively seeking to acquire Bitcoin, leading to robust Bitcoin demand . Axel Adler Jr.: Gaining Crypto Analyst Insights You Can Trust In the vast sea of crypto commentary, identifying reliable sources is critical. Axel Adler Jr. has established himself as a reputable crypto analyst known for his deep dives into on-chain data. His analysis often provides a more fundamental perspective on market movements, moving beyond mere price charts to reveal the underlying transactional behavior of market participants. By focusing on metrics like the exchange inflow/outflow ratio, analysts like Adler Jr. offer a window into genuine supply and demand dynamics, rather than speculative noise. His recent update is not just a single data point; it’s an interpretation based on a sophisticated understanding of how these metrics reflect investor sentiment and capital flows. For those looking to make informed decisions in the crypto space, paying attention to such expert crypto analyst insights can provide a significant edge. Unlocking Value with On-Chain Metrics : Why They Matter The exchange inflow/outflow ratio is just one of many powerful on-chain metrics that provide unparalleled transparency into the Bitcoin network. Unlike traditional financial markets where much of the data is proprietary or delayed, the blockchain offers a real-time, immutable ledger of all transactions. This allows analysts to track various activities, including: Wallet Balances: Observing the distribution of Bitcoin across different wallet sizes can indicate accumulation by whales or retail investors. Transaction Volume: High transaction volumes often signal increased network activity and interest. Miner Behavior: Tracking miner selling patterns can offer clues about their profitability and potential supply pressure. Long-Term Holder Supply: Identifying how much Bitcoin is held by long-term investors (those who haven’t moved their coins for extended periods) can indicate conviction and reduced selling pressure. These on-chain metrics collectively paint a comprehensive picture of the network’s health and the true underlying Bitcoin demand . They offer a distinct advantage over purely technical analysis by providing insights into the fundamental forces of supply and demand that drive price movements. When a metric like the BTC exchange ratio aligns with historical patterns, it provides a compelling case for continued strength. Navigating Current Market Trends : What This Means for Investors The signal from the BTC exchange ratio is a significant piece of the puzzle for understanding current market trends . If the ratio continues to indicate strong demand, it suggests that buyers are absorbing available supply, potentially setting the stage for further upward price action. For investors, this insight can be incredibly valuable: For HODLers: This reinforces the conviction to hold onto their assets, as the underlying demand appears robust. For Traders: It might signal opportunities for long positions, especially during dips, as strong underlying demand could provide support. For New Entrants: It highlights that despite price fluctuations, the fundamental interest in Bitcoin remains high, making it an attractive asset for long-term consideration. However, it’s crucial to remember that no single metric tells the whole story. While the exchange ratio is a powerful indicator, it should be considered alongside broader macroeconomic factors, regulatory developments, and overall investor sentiment. Yet, the current reading certainly paints a bullish picture for the continuation of positive market trends for Bitcoin. Challenges and Nuances: A Balanced View While the strong BTC exchange ratio is undoubtedly a positive sign, it’s important to approach such data with a balanced perspective. No single metric is infallible, and the crypto market is known for its volatility and unexpected turns. Some factors to consider include: Exchange Type: The data might not differentiate between various types of exchanges (e.g., centralized vs. decentralized) or the reasons for transfers (e.g., internal transfers between user accounts, or movement to cold storage). Whale Movements: A few large transactions by institutional players or whales could significantly skew the ratio temporarily. Macroeconomic Headwinds: Broader economic conditions, interest rate hikes, or geopolitical events can override even the strongest on-chain signals. Therefore, while the current crypto analyst insights are highly encouraging, investors should always combine such data with a holistic view of the market, including technical analysis, fundamental analysis of the broader crypto ecosystem, and global economic indicators. This comprehensive approach ensures a more resilient investment strategy. Conclusion: Bitcoin’s Resilient Demand Story Continues The latest update from Axel Adler Jr. regarding Bitcoin’s exchange inflow/outflow ratio offers a compelling testament to the enduring and robust Bitcoin demand . By drawing parallels to the early stages of the late 2023 bull run, this crucial on-chain metric suggests that underlying buying pressure remains strong, supporting positive market trends . For anyone navigating the dynamic crypto landscape, these expert crypto analyst insights serve as a powerful reminder that fundamental supply-demand dynamics are often the true drivers of long-term value. As Bitcoin continues its journey, keeping an eye on these vital on-chain signals will be key to understanding its trajectory and capitalizing on its potential.

2025-06-25T13:37:51,"Barclays says no to crypto transactions using credit cards","Another day, another bank turning its back on crypto. Barclays’ card ban underscores the growing tension between digital assets and traditional finance. According to a notice on its official website, Barclays will start blocking all cryptocurrency purchases made with its credit cards beginning June 27, 2025. The UK banking giant cited concerns over market volatility and consumer debt risks, arguing that sudden price drops could leave cardholders unable to repay borrowed funds. The policy also highlights the lack of regulatory safeguards. Unlike traditional investments, crypto purchases aren’t covered by the Financial Ombudsman Service or the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, Barclays said in the notice. You might also like: Metaplanet to buy more Bitcoin with $515M share offering Barclays’ quiet crackdown on crypto access Barclays’ decision to block crypto credit card transactions is the latest move in a years-long tug-of-war between UK banks and digital assets. By halting credit card access to crypto, the bank is making a calculated risk assessment that prioritizes customer debt exposure over market participation. While the policy might feel abrupt, it’s consistent with Barclays’ longstanding skepticism toward crypto. Back in 2021, a longtime customer vented on Reddit after the bank froze their account for attempting a transfer to Crypto.com. Despite passing security checks, the user faced a 15-day review, with Barclays citing “protection” as the reason, a move that sparked backlash for its selective enforcement (gambling transactions, for instance, faced no such scrutiny). This isn’t an isolated stance. Barclays joins a cohort of major financial institutions, including JPMorgan, Bank of America, Chase UK, and Starling, that have either fully blocked or tightly constrained crypto-related transactions. Industry reaction has been split. The Payments Association has historically opposed blanket crypto bans, arguing they unfairly equate digital assets with gambling. In 2023, the group challenged a proposed UK crackdown on credit card crypto purchases, with policy head Riccardo Tordera-Ricchi stating consumers should be trusted to “make informed decisions within their existing credit limits.” Which options are customers left with? With Barclays exiting the space via credit rails, UK crypto users are left with fewer mainstream onramps. According to MoonPay, banks like RBS remain comparatively open to crypto activity, while others, such as NatWest and Metro Bank, have tightened restrictions or blocked transactions outright. Users looking for alternatives may need to shift to debit payments, use third-party payment methods like Apple Pay or Google Pay, or rely on platforms such as MoonPay that offer non-custodial services and broader acceptance rates. Meanwhile, Barclays’ restriction contrasts with its own exploration of blockchain for institutional use. In 2017, Barclays’ CTO discussed private, permissioned blockchain pilots aimed at streamlining trade processes. More recently, it took part in a landmark institutional trade using JPMorgan’s Onyx tokenized collateral network alongside BlackRock, showcasing its engagement with blockchain frameworks.

2025-06-25T13:33:08,"Can Bitcoin and Ethereum Recover? Analyst Says ""Yes"", Shares His Price Prediction for BTC and ETH by the End of 2025!","Leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) fell below the psychological five-digit level of $100,000 at the beginning of this week due to the developments between Israel and Iran, but rose above $106,000 again with the ceasefire news. The rise in Bitcoin was accompanied by altcoins, with Ethereum (ETH) rising above $2,400, while altcoins such as Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and XRP experienced small increases. While there is curiosity about whether the rise will continue, Bitget Research chief analyst Ryan Lee announced his predictions. Bitcoin, which fell to $98,000 due to the Israel-Iran tension, later recovered. However, Ryan Lee pointed out that BTC did not immediately stabilize after its initial drop below $99,000, and said that although strong ETF inflows provided structural support for BTC, the risk continued and signaled the need to be cautious. “Bitcoin still has the potential to be a safe haven, but risk appetite is under control in BTC. This delays BTC's recovery.” Stating that the risk in Bitcoin continues, the analyst thinks that the rise will continue in the long term. At this point, Ryan Lee predicted that Bitcoin would reach $110,000-115,000 in Q3 and potentially $130,000-160,000 by the end of the year. Lee also added that he expects Ethereum to rise to between $2,600-$2,800 in the near-term and up to $5,500 in the long-term. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-25T13:30:25,"Barclays halts credit card support for customer crypto transactions","Barclays Bank is informing customers it will no longer allow debit or credit card payments to crypto exchanges, including Binance. The decision was disclosed earlier this week, following a June 23 decision from the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) targeting Binance Markets Limited. The bank communicated the new policy directly to clients, stating it was implemented “to help keep your money safe.” In a message posted to social media, Barclays said: “We’ve made the decision to stop payments made by credit/debit card to Binance until further notice.” The restriction does not impact users’ ability to withdraw funds from Binance, but blocks customers from making any crypto transactions via the bank’s credit cards. Barclays is directing customers to the FCA website for additional information about investing in crypto assets, particularly Binance. FCA Binance warning causes crypto banking hiatus Barclays’ decision comes against the backdrop of the FCA’s public notice on Monday, in which the regulator barred Binance Markets Limited from offering any regulated financial services within the UK as from June 27. Barclays FAQ on crypto transactions. Source: Barclays Bank website The FCA has repeatedly issued cautions over the risks of crypto investments, particularly through online platforms and social media advertising that promise high returns. “Be wary of online and social media advertisements that promise high returns on investments in crypto assets or related products,” the FCA wrote in its statement. The authority does not regulate assets like Bitcoin or Ether directly, but it oversees certain crypto derivatives and tokens that fall under its definition of securities. Binance responded to the FCA’s announcement by insisting that Binance Markets Limited is a distinct legal entity from Binance.com. Crypto fraud prompts bank policy change According to the FCA, crypto platforms are being used for illicit activities in organized fraud networks. Criminals exploit crypto exchanges to convert stolen funds into digital assets, making them harder to trace. UK consumers lost over £75 million to scams originating on social media, according to the watchdog. The FCA had already banned Binance Markets Limited from operating in the UK back in June 2021 due to its failure to comply with regulatory obligations. That ban remains in effect today. In response, many UK banks have moved to block customer transfers to crypto platforms. A recent industry assessment shows that approximately 47% of major UK banks offer no support for cryptocurrency transactions. Of these, at least seven institutions, including high-street banks, prohibit both transfers and debit or credit card purchases involving digital assets. Banks have lambasted crypto platforms like Binance, Kraken, Kucoin, and Coinbase for allegedly failing to enforce adequate safeguards against money laundering. They argue that the lack of transaction tracking allows criminals to use the platforms for illicit financial flows. Binance and Kraken have firmly denied the accusations, reiterating that they implement anti-money laundering procedures and are committed to protecting users from fraud. Barclays joins others such as TSB, The Co-operative Bank, and Santander in fully blocking transfers to all crypto exchanges. A Binance spokesperson said the company was “disappointed that Barclays appears to have taken unilateral action based on what appears to be an inaccurate understanding of events.” The spokesperson added that Binance.com is still operational and accessible to UK residents, despite the regulatory action taken against Binance Markets Limited. The Bank of England is preparing to release new guidelines for banks’ exposure to digital assets, expected to take effect by 2026. Last week, David Bailey, executive director of prudential policy at the Bank of England, talked about the proposals during a speech at the Risk Live Europe conference in London. He noted that regulators now prefer adding restrictive limits to digital assets, until more evidence is available. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-06-25T13:28:43,"What SHIB Price Would Be If Shiba Inu Surpasses Tether (USDT)","Shiba Inu (SHIB) has consistently been one of the most discussed cryptocurrencies in the market due to its large supply and active community. Despite its recent drop to a 16-month low of $0.00001010, SHIB has remained in the top 20 crypto assets, ranked 19th by market cap as of now. It still faces pressure from Litecoin, which could push it down one more spot if SHIB’s valuation continues to drop. However, the long-term outlook held by its supporters focuses not on its current decline but on what the future could hold, particularly the possibility of surpassing Tether’s market cap. Shiba Inu’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, had previously expressed the ambition of bringing SHIB into the top five global cryptocurrencies. The idea of SHIB overtaking Tether may seem unlikely in the short term, but understanding the math behind such a scenario can help evaluate its feasibility. Market Cap SHIB Needs to Beat Tether To determine how much one SHIB could be worth if it overtook Tether, it’s important to compare their market valuations. Currently, Tether (USDT) ranks third overall with a market cap of $156.02 billion. Shiba Inu, on the other hand, has a market capitalization of around $6.37 billion. In a hypothetical situation where SHIB’s market cap increases to $156.1 billion—slightly above Tether’s current figure—it would rise to become the third-largest cryptocurrency globally, behind only Bitcoin and Ethereum. Projected SHIB Price at a $156 Billion Market Cap Assuming Shiba Inu maintains its circulating supply of 589.25 trillion tokens, a $156.1 billion market cap would place the price of a single SHIB at approximately $0.0002649. This figure represents an increase of over 2,300% from its present value of $0.00001081. For context, SHIB’s highest recorded price was $0.00008845 in October 2021, at which point its market cap was still under $45 billion. Reaching $0.0002649 would not only break SHIB’s previous price record but also eliminate one of its leading zeros—something the asset has never done. Can SHIB Realistically Reach $0.0002649? While this price target is ambitious, it is not entirely dismissed by analysts. Forecasts from crypto data platforms suggest that such a valuation might be achievable in the coming years. According to Changelly, SHIB could hit this level by May 2032, while Telegaon offers a more aggressive timeline, predicting the target could be met as early as 2028. Other market watchers have also weighed in with similar expectations. In September 2024, an analyst identified only as Michael highlighted a bullish Elliott Wave pattern in SHIB’s chart and concluded that a price surge to $0.0002 could occur in the medium term. Around the same time, another trader known as Charting Guy asked in November 2024, “are your bags packed enough for something like this?.” The trader’s statement came when SHIB was priced at $0.000025, with an anticipated price of $0.0002. Since then, the token has fallen by 60%, currently trading near $0.00001081. Despite these fluctuations, past rallies offer a reminder that SHIB is capable of sharp upward movements. The most notable occurred during the 2020–2021 cycle, when SHIB saw exponential growth over a short period. While current price action does not point to an immediate surge, the possibility of SHIB attaining a $156 billion market cap remains open, but highly speculative. The long-term vision set by the Shiba Inu team , combined with support from committed holders and periodic bursts of trading activity, could provide the momentum needed for such a move. For now, surpassing Tether would require both significant market interest and favorable macroeconomic conditions. However, if it happens, each SHIB could be worth close to $0.0002649.

2025-06-25T13:27:26,"Ex-Employee Hacks Bedrock UniBTC for $2M: Fuzzland Uncovers Insider Exploit","Fuzzland has disclosed a $2 million insider attack that targeted Bedrock’s UniBTC protocol in September 2024, was carried out by a former employee who used malware, social engineering, and privileged access to compromise internal systems. Fuzzland has taken full responsibility for the breach and reimbursed all affected parties. Insider Access Used in $2M Bedrock Protocol Exploit Fuzzland, in a post on X, revealed that a past employee exploited the UniBTC protocol via a sophisticated insider operation. The individual joined the company under the guise of a skilled MEV developer and later inserted a trojan into Fuzzland’s MEV codebase using a malicious Rust crate named rands. https://t.co/zGdP4bKWzI — 𝕗𝕦𝕫𝕫𝕝𝕒𝕟𝕕 (@fuzzland_) June 23, 2025 The attack vector began with social engineering. The former employee impressed during interviews and demonstrated a functioning MEV bot, earning access to the company’s infrastructure. On September 4, 2024, the attacker modified the project’s Cargo.toml file to include the trojan, which auto-executed in commonly used IDEs such as VSCode and JetBrains. The malware allowed persistent, undetected access to engineering workstations for over three weeks. Security tools such as Falcon and AVG failed to detect the intrusion. However, on September 26, Fuzzland discussed a vulnerability in UniBTC, discovered in a Dedaub report, during an emergency call. Just over an hour later, at 18:28 UTC, the UniBTC protocol was exploited. @Bedrock_DeFi , a multi-asset liquid staking protocol, has confirmed it suffered a security breach involving its synthetic Bitcoin token, uniBTC. #Hack #DeFi https://t.co/fRStCw7hK1 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 27, 2024 In response, Fuzzland compensated Bedrock for its losses using company funds. The firm enlisted Web3 security firm zeroShadow to investigate the breach and rule out any internal collusion. It also filed reports with both the FBI and Chinese law enforcement to pursue criminal action. Despite the attack, Bedrock’s total value locked (TVL) grew from $240 million in September 2024 to $535 million in June 2025, according to DeFiLlama data. Fuzzland Launches Major Security Revamp Amid Industry-Wide Spike in Crypto Hacks To safeguard its systems from future incidence, Fuzzland launched new internal controls and adopted enhanced vetting procedures. This includes on-site employee screenings, detailed know-your-employee (KYE) verification, and strict privilege separation. Sensitive systems remain isolated, and private keys are secured in trusted execution environments (TEEs). According to its report, Fuzzland has implemented software bill of materials (SBOM) checks across all codebases. This ensures that any malicious dependencies are flagged before deployment. Fuzzland also expanded its source code analysis capabilities by integrating tools like CodeQL and CodeRabbit. Additionally, Fuzzland reinforced its protocols for handling intelligence under TLP:RED, ensuring strict need-to-know access for vulnerability information. Fuzzland also acknowledged the contributions of Bedrock, SEAL 911 , Slowmist, and zeroShadow in coordinating a swift response. It shared threat indicators such as suspicious IP addresses and malware samples on VirusTotal to assist the broader security community.

2025-06-25T13:23:12,"Genesis Collapse: DCG Execs Ignored Warnings, Foresaw Legal Threat—Now Facing ‘Alter Ego’ Lawsuit","Newly unsealed court documents from bankrupt crypto lender Genesis allege that executives at its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), knowingly ignored warning signs about the lender’s fragile state, while preparing for the legal fallout. The unredacted complaint, filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery and released publicly by the Genesis Litigation Oversight Committee (LOC), contains internal memos and emails indicating that DCG executives feared Genesis could be legally treated as their “alter ego.” DCG Ignored Red Flags While Extracting Value from Insolvent Genesis, Lawsuit Claims According to the filing , DCG’s Chief Financial Officer Michael Kraines raised alarm in a 2022 internal strategy memo. He posed a “war-gaming” scenario where creditors could pierce the corporate veil and hold DCG liable. In the memo, Kraines wrote: “Genesis is the puppet of DCG. It is 100% owned and controlled by DCG and does what DCG tells it to do.” He added that such control, along with undercapitalization, could trigger legal action from “deep pocketed creditors.” Source: Genesis The committee claims that this foresight did not prompt corrective action. Instead, internal documents reveal how DCG and its CEO Barry Silbert allegedly treated Genesis as a source of funds, referring to it as a “de facto treasury.” The complaint accuses DCG of extracting value from Genesis through insider loans and risky trades, even as the lender drifted toward insolvency. “Silbert and his insiders exploited Genesis for their own benefit,” said Philippe Selendy, counsel for the LOC. “Internal DCG and Genesis documents now provide more detail than ever seen before.” The filing points to multiple warning signs. Genesis’s loan book had tripled in size while, according to internal reports, the firm lacked proper risk controls. Its external auditor flagged “material weaknesses” as early as 2020. DCG reportedly formed a risk committee but delayed its first meeting for nine months. Kraines later joked that the delay “just got his future deposition easier.” Genesis insiders also described a “culture of submission,” claiming they were pressured to serve DCG’s interests. In one internal message from 2022, an employee wrote that Genesis was being “propped up” so DCG could “borrow while they could to get the cash out.” The complaint further alleges that Genesis misled the public after the collapse of Three Arrows Capital. Employees were instructed to follow pre-approved scripts, and Silbert himself amplified claims on social media that Genesis remained stable. The committee is also challenging two transactions as fraudulent. These include the issuance of a promissory note on June 30, 2022, and a roundtrip deal in September, both described as efforts to mask Genesis’s financial distress. Genesis is now seeking to recover more than $3.3 billion from DCG, Silbert, and others. The LOC, formed to represent Genesis creditors, said the complaint reveals a “deliberate scheme” that left customers behind while insiders extracted value. “These are not merely technical disputes over intercompany accounting,” the LOC said. “The level of coordination, secrecy, and callousness alleged is nothing short of breathtaking.” Genesis Pushes Forward with Lawsuits and Repayments Amid Ongoing DCG Legal Storm As the fallout from Genesis’ collapse continues, the bankrupt crypto lender is intensifying its legal campaign against its parent company, DCG, in a bid to recover billions for creditors. In Delaware, Genesis is pursuing a lawsuit to claw back over $2.2 billion in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other crypto assets, aiming to redistribute the funds to its still-unpaid creditors. Genesis has sued its parent company, @DCGco , and CEO @BarrySilbert , accusing them of engineering insider transactions that drove the firm into bankruptcy. #DCG #Genesis https://t.co/MLcJoiZ3rI — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 20, 2025 A separate case, filed in the Southern District of New York, targets more than $1 billion in allegedly fraudulent transfers, including $450 million in crypto sent to DCG, and $297 million routed to its international arm. Genesis is also disputing $34 million in so-called “tax payments” it now calls illegitimate. Genesis’ financial troubles date back to the collapse of Three Arrows Capital, which triggered liquidity issues, later deepened by the FTX implosion. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January 2023 , listing over $3.5 billion in debt owed to major creditors like Gemini and VanEck. Although Genesis finalized a restructuring plan in August 2024, tensions with DCG remain. DCG had defaulted on over $620 million in debt , prompting Genesis to sue for full repayment, including 4,550 BTC. Progress has been slow but steady. By May 2024, Genesis had returned $2.18 billion to over 232,000 users, including through a pending $1.8 billion settlement with Gemini Earn participants. However, regulatory pressure mounts. The CFTC is pursuing Gemini over alleged violations, with trial set for January 2025 . Meanwhile, the SEC charged Genesis and DCG earlier this year with investor fraud, DCG has since agreed to pay a $38 million fine. The SEC has charged Genesis and Digital Currency Group for misleading investors about their financial health, resulting in a $38 million fine. #SEC #CryptoRegulations https://t.co/HAqe03QsWw — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 17, 2025 As legal battles unfold, Genesis continues its effort to recover and return funds, while its former parent, DCG, remains in the regulatory crosshairs.

2025-06-25T13:21:49,"Bitcoin Treasuries Everywhere as Metaplanet Raises $500M: Why BTC Bull Token Could Explode","Bitcoin has been given yet another overwhelming vote of confidence as a premier treasury asset. Metaplanet, a Japanese Bitcoin treasury company, recently announced an ambitious plan to raise $5.4B worth of $BTC by 2027 EOY. The company has already collected over $517M within 24 hours. Metaplanet is following in the footsteps of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) with a definitive goal in mind – to hold around 1% of the total 21M $BTC supply, as the filing shows. That’s an eye-watering 210K $BTC, an expensive exercise to say the least. Strategy, by the way, currently holds around 592K in $BTC . As $BTC treasuries grow in number, Bitcoin-themed altcoins like the BTC Bull Token are set to ride the wave. All Aboard The Bitcoin Train Earlier this month Metaplanet announced that it had acquired 1,112 $BTC , bringing its total holdings to 10K at the time. That figure now stands at 11,111 $BTC, still a considerable 198.9K short of its 2027 goal. That’s where the company’s new 555M plan fits in. Like Strategy, Metaplanet is embarking on what it claims to be Asia’s largest-ever public equity capital raise. And that entails issuing 555M shares at $9.59 each. In the first tranche, it has already issued 54M shares, which raised $517.8M on day one. Bitcoin treasuries raising funds to buy $BTC is a no-brainer, but it’s not only fintechs that are jumping on the bandwagon. A Norwegian mining company has announced that it too is establishing a Bitcoin treasury, making digital assets a core part of its financing strategy. Green Minerals, which specializes in ​​deep sea mining and sustainable mineral extraction, has announced plans to invest up to $1.2B (with the help of partners) to establish a Bitcoin treasury. This move, according to a media statement by Green Minerals, ‘underscores the company’s determination to leverage digital assets as a core component of its financial structure and future growth.’ The treasury will support its core mining projects as the company continues to implement blockchain technology for greater transparency across its supply chain, as well as for certification and efficiency. The Ripple Effect as Bitcoin Gains Momentum The signs are clear – more governments and companies are setting up Bitcoin treasuries. That’s a definitive motion of confidence in $BTC as a legitimate store of value, and not merely a speculative asset. And we expect the boost in market credibility – across the entire crypto space – will attract even more institutional and retail investors. The growing attention given to Bitcoin is sparking interest in other corners of the crypto market, and that includes the world of meme coins. Bear in mind that, while $BTC leads with utility and scarcity, meme coins thrive on culture, viral momentum, and community backing. Still, in this shifting landscape, some meme coins are standing out more than others – not for laughs, but for their innovative investor incentives. The meme coins designed to support, champion, or improve Bitcoin are particularly noteworthy. Take Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , for instance, the meme coin that will power a much-needed Bitcoin Layer-2 protocol. This token is in the midst of a viral presale and has already raised $1.6M in under two months. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is another such viral coin that could be on track to explode as additional Bitcoin treasuries are set up around the world. After all, $BTCBULL is the ultimate Bitcoin champion and it brings real $BTC investor rewards to the table. Is BTC Bull Token Destined to Explode? Why? Strategy co-founder and former CEO Michael Saylor believes that the $BTC price will reach $21M in 21 years . And with the significant uptick in Bitcoin adoption, the BTC Bull Token is in a very good position. That’s because $BTCBULL is Bitcoin’s biggest cheerleader, and the only token to reward holders with real $BTC airdrops, making it one of the best new crypto projects to watch in 2025. $BTCBULL is designed to champion $BTC’s charge to $250K and beyond – all the way to $1M. Each time the $BTC price reaches another +$50K milestone, $BTCBULL holders can partake in exclusive $BTC airdrops, as long as they hold their $BTCBULL in Best Wallet . That in itself makes $BTCBULL a very attractive investment. Token burns are also included in the $BTCBULL roadmap (when $BTC hits $125K, $175K, and $225K). By reducing the available token supply, BTC Bull Token’s increasing scarcity is likely to drive up its price after listing. Accounting for its deflationary tokenomics and HODLing incentives, our $BTCBULL price prediction sees the coin potentially hitting $0.06467 in 2025. Right now, $BTCBULL is still on presale, with $7.38M+ already raised. However, there are less than five days to go before the ICO ends. That means time is running out if you haven’t yet got your hands on what has the potential to be among the best meme coins of the year. If you’re wondering how to invest in BTC Bull Token today at its current price of $0.00258, our guide to buying $BTCBULL has you covered. For more project details, BTC Bull Token provides transparent information in its whitepaper , as well as regular project updates on the official BTC Bull Token X channel . Three Cheers for $BTC and Its Champions The unpredictable and ever-changing cryptoverse is an exciting place to be right now. And with institutional adoption of Bitcoin at an all-time high, we’re here for it. That’s because what’s good for Bitcoin is good for the rest of the market. And that includes newer projects, like $BTCBULL and $HYPER . As always, though, be sure to DYOR before making any investment.

2025-06-25T13:20:48,"Bitcoin Springs Past $106K After Iran-Israel Ceasefire Announcement","Nevertheless, the leading cryptocurrency is back to winning ways after reclaiming the $106,000 level due to growing optimism over a potential Iran-Israel ceasefire meant to ease geopolitical tensions. Bitcoin’s Rebound Renews Hope Anxiety in the financial market dropped after the U.S. President Donald Trump declared a “total ceasefire” between Israel and Iran, shifting trader focus to whether Bitcoin can rally toward $110,000 or if lingering downside risks will cap the momentum. The ceasefire eased fears of further military escalation and global oil supply shocks. Markets had largely priced in de-escalation, as oil prices began falling even after Iran targeted U.S. bases in Qatar. At the time of this writing, Bitcoin was up by 1.7% in the past 24 hours to hit $107,040. According to market analyst Crypto King, BTC is eyeing a more upside momentum, thanks to negative funding rates. The analyst pointed out , “BTC has reclaimed $105K, and funding rates have turned negative once again—a classic setup for a potential Bitcoin short squeeze. With shorts piling in, history suggests an upward move could be imminent for Bitcoin and altcoins.” Negative funding rates are often considered bullish because they indicate that short traders (those betting on price declines) are dominant and paying long traders to hold their positions. Therefore, it shows that more traders are shorting Bitcoin in the perpetual futures market. Another trader by the name Crypto Andy opined that the $105K zone would determine if Bitcoin will experience the next leg up to the $110K zone or a deeper retest was incoming as Bollinger Bands continue to tighten, which is a classic sign of incoming volatility. Why Reclaiming $105K is Bullish Bitcoin’s return to the $105,000 zone marks a pivotal bullish inflection point—and here's why its reclamation matters for the digital asset’s next leg up: 1. Technical Breakout Fuels Momentum The $105K level stands as a strong support zone. Bitcoin not only reclaimed but rebounded off this zone—backed by the 50-day EMA near $103,818—signaling renewed conviction among traders Technical analysts suggest this breakthrough sets up a classic breakout‑fill‑continue pattern. 2. Macro Tailwinds: Fed Pivot & Weak Dollar Markets anticipate the Fed beginning rate cuts later in 2025. Bitcoin’s recent climb above $105K came alongside dovish signals at the last FOMC meeting and improving inflation trends. A softer U.S. dollar, at its worst opening half in years, historically boosts crypto’s appeal as an inflation hedge. 3. Surging Institutional Flows & Strategic Adoption Indirect Bitcoin exposure —for example via MicroStrategy—is estimated to amount to $50 billion, driven by notable exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows and passive funds. Additionally, geopolitical developments such as the U.S. government’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (200K BTC held) lend legitimacy to Bitcoin as a sovereign reserve asset. 4. Bullish Forecasts Validate Momentum Analysts expect Bitcoin to climb to $120–$125K by mid‑2025, with institutional voices like Tom Lee projecting $150–$250K by year‑end. On‑chain and sentiment indicators (active addresses ~23M, Fear & Greed Index greed-zone) confirm a bullish backdrop 5. Psychological and Structural Impact Breaking above $105K transforms a key resistance into support, shifting market psychology decisively positive. The $107–108K range becomes the next target, with eyes on $112K+ all‑time highs. As long-term holders step aside and new inflows arrive, downside risk is limited—suggesting a structured climb rather than a parabolic spike prone to crash. Conclusion Bitcoinback above $105,000 might be the linchpin needed to unlock the next upward phase. With technical, macro, institutional, and psychological forces reinforcing each other, the momentum is strong. As analysts now set sights on $120K+ through Q3–Q4, and total institutional caps rise, this zone's reclamation could prove one of 2025’s most decisive bullish signals. Nevertheless, a keen eye should be given to the Iran-Israel situation because it has the potential of shaping how the financial market progresses in the short term.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9703/bitcoin-springs-past-106-k-after-iran-israel-ceasefire-announcement,"BTC|COMMODITY|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-06-25T13:13:35,"Ethereum Whales Buy the Dip Despite $312M Mega Transfer","The high-net-worth Ethereum trader amassed tens of millions in ETH, bucking the broader market slump driven by escalating Middle East tensions and renewed risk-off sentiment. Ethereum Regains Momentum Whale Alert flagged a massive transfer of 129,392 ETH to Coinbase from a long-dormant wallet, last active in November 2022. The sudden $312M ETH transfer, coinciding with a drop in Ethereum’s price to lows of $2,200, had fueled speculation of an imminent selloff. Nevertheless, the second-largest cryptocurrency based on market capitalization is back to winning ways, having recorded an 11.2% increase in the past 24 hours to trade at $2,472. Therefore, the Ethereum whale that bought the dip might be laughing all the way to the bank after recently purchasing 9,400 ETH. As Ethereum edges closer to the psychological price of $2,500, the Ethereum whale buy paints a bullish picture for the largest altcoin. Ethereum’s Weekly Engagements Go Through the Roof According to market analyst Crypto King, “ETH just hit a new all-time high in weekly engagement — over 20.2 million active addresses last week. The Ethereum ecosystem continues to grow, showing strength and resilience despite market headwinds.” Therefore, it means more unique wallet addresses interacted with the Ethereum network this past week than ever before. This record high development signals that Ethereum’s ecosystem is thriving with engagement, showing growing interest from users. With Ethereum a Layer 2 (L2) boom in networks, such as Base, Arbitrum, and Optimism, this growth is fueling the weekly engagement fire. Furthermore, increased participation across decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, non-fungible token (NFT) markets, gaming, and Metaverse apps is boosting address interactions. Therefore, Ethereum’s ATH weekly engagement reflects robust ecosystem usage, which is being ignited largely by Layer‑2 expansion, booming DeFi/NFT activity, and broader on‑chain optimization. Will Ethereum Catapult the Next Altcoin Season? By trading at $2,472, Ethereum continues to show signs of resilience even amid broader market shifts. Here's why ETH is well-positioned to ignite the next altcoin season: 1. ETH Leading the Charge Against BTC The ETH/BTC ratio is breaking out, hinting at capital flowing into Ethereum and altcoins as Bitcoin dominance cools. June trends since 2022 show altcoins outperforming BTC—currently around 23% of altcoins are beating Bitcoin, and that figure is growing. This BTC fatigue often marks the onset of alt seasons, with ETH historically at the helm. 2. Surge in ETH Activity and Infrastructure Ethereum's Pectra upgrade has boosted network efficiency, lowering fees and enhancing user experience—spurring DeFi and Layer‑2 growth. Layer‑2 throughput is now at 533 transactions/sec, deviating some demand from Layer‑1 and supporting broader altcoin ecosystem expansion. Additionally, Ethereum hosts nearly half of global stablecoin issuance, strengthening its financial ecosystem. These developments not only deepen adoption but also improve capital velocity across the network. 3. Institutional and On‑Chain Momentum $286 million of inflows into ETH ETFs occurred recently, reflecting growing institutional confidence. Additionally, the Ethereum ETFs recently made a 4-month high after recording daily inflows of $125 million. On‑chain analytics show 67% of ETH holders in profit, with strong support zones around $2,316–$2,402. Derivatives data and open interest in ETH instruments are surging post-Pectra, signaling elevated market interest. These metrics underscore a foundation of investor conviction and structural support. 4. Timing: Aligning with Historical Patterns Every June since 2022 has seen the start of an alt season. Current conditions—Bitcoin stagnation, rising altcoin performance, capital rotation—mirror triggers from past cycles. While some analysts argue Bitcoin still dominates, many contend that altcoin narratives will unfold via ETH-led waves, not a blanket altcoin surge . All signals point to a scenario in which Ethereum sparks a phased altcoin rally. Conclusion Ethereum’s technological upgrades, network usage, institutional demand, and market timing combine to create the ideal spark for altcoin season 2025. ETH is orchestrating a broader shift that could elevate a wide array of Layer‑1s, DeFi tokens, and emerging narratives like decentralized AI and gaming chains. With Ethereum being a stone’s throw away from the psychological price of $2,500, it remains to be seen whether ETH dip buying will thrust bullish momentum or exchange inflows will halt the party through intensified selling pressure.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9702/ethereum-whales-buy-the-dip-despite-312-m-mega-transfer,"ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","News|Ethereum",cryptocompare

With market structure compromised, reclaiming $2,600 is now critical for the bulls to stay in control. After establishing a local bottom at $2,111, Ethereum ( ETH ) staged a sharp rebound. However, this move appears to be more of a short squeeze than a genuine trend reversal. Price has now rallied into a key resistance zone at $2,600, an area packed with technical confluence and historical relevance.

Market Structure Break: Recent drop invalidated higher high/higher low sequence on daily timeframe. ETHUSDT (1D) Chart, Source: TradingView Ethereum’s price is currently trading beneath one of its most important resistance zones in recent memory. The $2,600 level previously acted as strong support but has now flipped into resistance following the breakdown. The technical significance of this zone is further amplified by the confluence of several indicators—the point of control, volume-weighted average price, and the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement from the previous swing high all cluster around $2,600. This makes it an area unlikely to be reclaimed without strong volume and bullish intent.

The prior daily trend of higher highs and higher lows was clearly invalidated during the recent drop to $2,111. That means the burden of proof now lies with the bulls. A reclaim of $2,600 would be the first step toward re-establishing bullish momentum. Without it, this current rally is best interpreted as a bearish retest. If Ethereum fails to reclaim the $2,600 level, a pullback becomes highly probable. The next immediate support sits around $2,227, which may offer a temporary reaction. However, a breakdown below this zone could send price much lower toward $1,790, a critical demand zone and previous base of support. This level would likely serve as a make-or-break support for a broader correction. What to expect in the coming price action Ethereum’s price is at a major inflection point. A confirmed breakout above $2,600 could reignite bullish structure and open the door to higher levels like $2,800. Failure to break through, however, sets the stage for a rejection-driven pullback toward $2,227, with $1,790 on the table if that support fails. Until $2,600 is reclaimed, short-term trend bias remains tilted to the downside.

2025-06-25T13:09:13,"BREAKING: $250K Raised as Bitcoin Pepe Announces Me3 Partnership","Bitcoin Pepe has been all gas, no brakes, rapidly becoming one of 2025’s best-funded presales, and now, following its Me3 partnership, it has quickly raised another quarter of a million.Onboarding has always been a friction point, but BPEP now has the answers. Me3 is an AI-powered onboarding engine, and this partnership marks a strategic acceleration for the PEP-20 token standard and will help bring more and more users onto this brand-new and lightning-fast layer 2. Bitcoin is ready to rip to $200K , markets are flipping back to risk-on, and AI projects are crushing investor mindshare. BPEP now finds itself sitting at the convergence of every major theme in crypto, and with $15.5m raised, everything points to an explosive second half of the year for all early BPEP believers and holders. Bitcoin Pepe announces Me3 partnership: Presale momentum hits overdrive Bitcoin Pepe has announced a long list of partnerships rolling out PEP-20 token standard adoption before the chain even goes live. The most recent partnership has clearly excited investors, judged by the $250K presale inflows, and smart money is betting on AI-powered onboarding flows. Me3 is a Web3 loyalty layer disguised as a gamified city. Me3 has been responsible for onboarding thousands of users across Asia, LATAM, and beyond. Now that very same infrastructure is being deployed to turbocharge Bitcoin Pepe. Bitcoin Pepe will receive AI-powered and enhanced user flows, smart UX that adapts to user behavior to increase retention rates, and Me3 engagement mechanics will massively amplify the usage of all BPEP products, from its native BTC bridge to in-house DEX. Gamified incentives are coming to the world’s first meme-focused Bitcoin layer 2, and smart money is betting big on the enhancing power of AI. How the PEP-20 token standard will revolutionize Bitcoin The PEP-20 standard is Bitcoin’s answer to ERC-20. Meme-native and permissionless asset creation is coming to BTC, and everyone knows that an explosion of asset creation is what drives layer 1s to crazy valuations. In simple terms, the PEP-20 token standard allows anyone to create a token directly on Bitcoin, and this opens the door for a DeFi explosion such as has been enjoyed by Solana and Ethereum—but this time fueled by $2 trillion in dormant capital . This crazy value proposition is why BPEP’s current price of $0.0416 looks criminally undervalued. Not to mention the rumored tier 1 CEX listing set to be announced on June 30th. Could BPEP be the best trade of 2025? Bitcoin has been a passive asset since its inception, but the idle era of BTC is ending. Bitcoin Pepe is about to power smart contracts and high-octane speculation. BTC is about to evolve from gold to gasoline, and the value creation vector is enormous. Building Solana on Bitcoin is why Bitcoin Pepe has raised a massive $15.5m as investors bet on the future of Bitcoin. And with viral AI-driven onboarding via Me3, the surface area for adoption has just multiplied. Solana was an excellent trade because it offered cheap and fast transactions. Now, BPEP is doing the same for Bitcoin. All of this takes place amid billion-dollar ETF inflows, rising BTC dominance, and the resurgence of meme coins. Timing is everything in crypto, and Bitcoin Pepe is surfing the perfect storm. This is how 100X trades emerge. This is due to the alignment of narratives, the presence of reflexive catalysts, and the expansion of surface areas. Bitcoin Pepe has all three, and the upcoming CEX listings have the power to send this token to the next level—retail is waking up, presale momentum has hit overdrive, and now BPEP sits squarely at the narrative center between Bitcoin, memes, and AI.

It also accepts payments in Bitcoin, PRE, and USDC. According to a press release sent to crypto.news, the search API for Presearch.com is now live for the first time. It is powered by a decentralized physical infrastructure network or DePIN built with over 40,000 active nodes that process searches in real-time. The Search API launch comes ahead of major tech firms like Microsoft which have decided to restrict user access to their search API, cutting off Bing data to focus on AI chatbot development. The shift has forced developers and web platforms seeking a new alternative, as over 90% of global web search is controlled by Google, Bing and Yandex. Unlike other search engines, Presearch.com and its API both run on decentralized infrastructure that encrypts and anonymizes every search, making it a non-profiling decentralized search engine. You might also like: Brave becomes the first web browser to launch on-chain domain naming service for over 85m users When a user taps into the search engine and submits a query, it will then pass through a gateway that removes all identifiable information belonging to the user. This means the browser is able to remove the user’s IP address and device metadata from the search query. Additionally, the decentralized API is now accessible to users who wish to pay with crypto for its services, accepting major tokens like Bitcoin ( BTC ), Presearch’s native token PRE, USD Coin ( USDC ), and even fiat for non-crypto users. CEO of Presearch, Tim Enneking, said that the team behind Presearch.com aims to drive forward freedom of information through its search engine and API, which it believes is “just as important as freedom of money.” “That’s why we built the world’s first non-profiling, decentralized search API—and why we’re thrilled to offer Bitcoin payments as part of our mission-aligned infrastructure,” said Enneking in his statement. Presearch is a decentralized search engine that protects user privacy, rewards node operators through its browser. So far, it has accumulated over 390,000 active monthly users, 13 million monthly impressions, and over 400,000 searches per day.

Sei ( SEI ) token climbed to a high of $0.3337, up by 110% from its lowest level this month, bringing its valuation to over $1.6 billion. The rally is likely driven by its partnership with Circle, the creator of USD Coin ( USDC ), which went public recently in a highly successful IPO. Circle’s IPO noted that it holds 6.25 million SEI tokens, an indication that the company believes in Sei’s mission. Further, Sei is one of eleven blockchain networks being reviewed by the Wyoming Stable Token Commission for the WYST stablecoin .

2025-06-25T13:00:27,"Arizona Bitcoin Bill HB2324: A Crucial Milestone for Digital Asset Reserves","BitcoinWorld Arizona Bitcoin Bill HB2324: A Crucial Milestone for Digital Asset Reserves The landscape of cryptocurrency adoption in the United States is constantly evolving, with states increasingly exploring innovative ways to integrate digital assets into their financial frameworks. A significant development on this front comes from the Grand Canyon State, as the Arizona Bitcoin Bill HB2324 has taken a monumental step forward, signaling a growing acceptance and strategic integration of cryptocurrencies at the state level. This move is poised to set a new precedent for how seized assets are managed and potentially usher in a new era for state-level digital asset strategies. What Does HB2324 Entail for Arizona’s Financial Future? Recently, the Arizona House of Representatives made headlines by passing the HB2324 bill. This legislative action, confirmed by sources like Bitcoin Laws on X, isn’t just another piece of paper; it represents a tangible shift in how state governments might handle financial assets, particularly those obtained through criminal activities. At its core, HB2324 aims to establish a dedicated Bitcoin Reserve Fund , specifically designed to hold assets that have been seized through criminal asset forfeiture. Imagine a scenario where ill-gotten gains, instead of being held in traditional, often depreciating, forms, are converted into a potentially appreciating digital asset like Bitcoin. This bill proposes exactly that, creating a unique mechanism for the state to manage and potentially grow these forfeited funds. The process is straightforward yet groundbreaking: Asset Seizure: When law enforcement agencies seize assets linked to criminal activities. Conversion to Bitcoin: A portion or all of these forfeited assets could be converted into Bitcoin. Reserve Fund Creation: These Bitcoins would then be held in a state-managed reserve, separate from general funds. Strategic Management: The fund’s purpose would be to potentially preserve or increase the value of these assets over time, benefiting the state and its citizens. This initiative underscores a forward-thinking approach to public finance, recognizing Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a potential store of value and a strategic reserve. Why is this a Game-Changer for US State Crypto Adoption? The passing of HB2324 by the Arizona House is far more than a local legislative event; it’s a significant indicator of the accelerating trend of US State Crypto Adoption . If signed into law by the governor, this would mark Arizona’s second such reserve bill to be enacted, building upon previous efforts to embrace digital assets. This consistent legislative push from Arizona positions it as a trailblazer in the national conversation around cryptocurrency integration. For other states observing these developments, Arizona provides a compelling case study on how to thoughtfully incorporate digital assets into state treasuries and financial operations. The implications are multi-faceted: Aspect Impact of HB2324 Precedent Setting Establishes a model for other states considering similar Bitcoin or digital asset reserve funds. Innovation & Leadership Solidifies Arizona’s reputation as a leader in crypto-forward legislation within the U.S. Economic Potential Offers a new avenue for states to potentially enhance public funds through strategic digital asset management. Regulatory Clarity Contributes to the broader discussion on creating clearer regulatory frameworks for digital assets at the state level. This progressive stance could inspire a domino effect, encouraging more states to explore similar legislative frameworks, thereby fostering a more robust and regulated environment for digital assets across the nation. How Does Digital Asset Forfeiture Work in Practice? The concept of Digital Asset Forfeiture , particularly concerning cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, has been a complex area for law enforcement and legal systems. Traditionally, asset forfeiture involves seizing physical property or fiat currency linked to criminal activities. However, with the rise of digital currencies, authorities have had to adapt. HB2324 provides a clear legal pathway for the state of Arizona to not only seize but also manage these digital assets in a novel way. Instead of simply liquidating seized Bitcoin into fiat currency, the bill proposes holding it as Bitcoin within the state’s reserve. This approach addresses several challenges inherent in digital asset forfeiture: Volatility Management: Holding Bitcoin directly could allow the state to benefit from its potential appreciation, rather than being forced to sell at potentially unfavorable market conditions immediately after seizure. Operational Efficiency: Streamlines the process of managing digital assets once seized, providing a dedicated framework. Legal Clarity: Offers a specific legal mandate for the state to engage with cryptocurrencies as part of its asset management strategy, reducing ambiguity for law enforcement and legal practitioners. While the specifics of how the conversion and management will be handled within the reserve fund are crucial details that will likely be outlined in implementation guidelines, the foundational legal framework provided by HB2324 is a monumental step forward for integrating digital assets into the state’s financial and legal operations. What Are the Potential Benefits and Considerations? The establishment of a Bitcoin Reserve Fund through HB2324 carries a myriad of potential benefits, alongside important considerations that need careful attention. Benefits: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin is often seen as a hedge against inflation. Holding a portion of state reserves in Bitcoin could protect the value of seized assets against the depreciation of fiat currency. Potential for Appreciation: Over the long term, Bitcoin has historically shown significant growth. This could mean that forfeited assets held in Bitcoin could appreciate, providing additional revenue for state programs or services. Technological Leadership: Arizona cements its position as a leader in embracing financial innovation and blockchain technology, attracting tech-savvy businesses and talent. Reduced Custodial Risk for Fiat: Diversifying assets reduces reliance solely on traditional banking systems and their associated risks. Considerations: Volatility Risk: While there’s potential for appreciation, Bitcoin’s price volatility is a significant factor. A sudden downturn could diminish the value of the reserve. The state would need robust policies for risk management. Security and Custody: Storing significant amounts of Bitcoin securely requires advanced cybersecurity measures and robust custodial solutions to prevent theft or loss. Regulatory Uncertainty: While state-level action is progressive, the broader federal regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, which could impact future state policies. Public Perception: Managing public expectations and understanding regarding the risks and benefits of holding volatile assets like Bitcoin in a public fund will be crucial. Navigating these considerations effectively will be key to the long-term success and sustainability of Arizona’s pioneering initiative. Looking Ahead: The Future of State-Level Digital Asset Integration The passage of the Arizona Bitcoin Bill HB2324 by the House marks a pivotal moment, but the journey isn’t over. The bill now awaits the final signature of the state governor. This final hurdle is critical, and its successful navigation would not only make Arizona a frontrunner in US State Crypto Adoption but also provide a tangible blueprint for other states to follow. The implications extend beyond just asset forfeiture; it signals a broader shift towards recognizing digital assets as legitimate components of state financial infrastructure. As states like Arizona continue to innovate, we can anticipate several trends: Increased Legislative Activity: More states will likely propose and pass bills related to digital asset custody, taxation, and integration into state treasuries. Focus on Education: There will be a growing need for education within state governments and among the public regarding the mechanics and implications of digital assets. Partnerships: States may seek partnerships with blockchain companies and crypto custodians to ensure secure and efficient management of digital assets. Federal Dialogue: State-level actions will inevitably feed into and influence the ongoing federal discussions about comprehensive cryptocurrency regulation. The move by Arizona is not just about a single bill; it’s about pioneering a new frontier where digital assets are no longer just for individual investors but are becoming an integral part of public finance and governance. A Groundbreaking Step for Arizona and Beyond The Arizona House of Representatives’ passage of the Arizona Bitcoin Bill HB2324 is undeniably a landmark event. By proposing the creation of a Bitcoin Reserve Fund from assets acquired through Digital Asset Forfeiture , Arizona is demonstrating a bold commitment to financial innovation and leadership in the realm of US State Crypto Adoption . This initiative, if signed into law, will not only establish a novel mechanism for managing state assets but also serve as a powerful testament to the growing mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin and other digital currencies. It sets a significant precedent for how states can strategically leverage the unique properties of cryptocurrencies for public benefit, while also highlighting the importance of robust frameworks for managing associated risks. As the bill awaits the governor’s signature, the eyes of the crypto world, and indeed, other state legislatures, will be fixed on Arizona, watching as it potentially paves the way for a new era of digital asset integration in public finance.

2025-06-25T13:00:06,"DeFi Development: The MicroStrategy Of Solana","Summary DeFi Development mirrors MicroStrategy's strategy by raising capital to accumulate Solana, aiming for both asset appreciation and staking yield. The company’s business model heavily depends on SOL’s price performance, making DFDV essentially a leveraged proxy for SOL with amplified volatility. SOL’s history of network outages adds significant risk, and DFDV lacks fundamental cash-generating operations to fall back on during downturns. Given these factors, I rate DFDV a cautious Hold, seeing it as more suitable for traders than long-term investors seeking fundamentals. DeFi Development Corporation ( DFDV ) is the latest example of a public company using its ability to raise capital as a way to invest in a portfolio of cryptocurrency, similar to Strategy ( MSTR ), which I've also covered . Just like MSTR, I've rated DFDV a Hold, largely because it's not something I can imagine buying but also because its volatility does make for a steady short thesis either. Recent History Much of what DeFi is stems from very recent actions, after being acquired in April . Shortly after the takeover, the strategy shifted toward forming a digital asset treasury . Specifically, this entailed purchasing Solana ( SOL-USD ), as opposed to Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). After that, they changed from their old name, Janover, to the current one , DeFi, short for Decentralized Finance. DFDV YTD Price History (Seeking Alpha) As of last month, the company announced having up to $107M of SOL. A penny stock at the start of the year, the takeover and SOL accumulation led to huge movement in the stock price, peaking in the $40s back in May. Now about half that, the market is more optimistic about the stock than at the start of the year, but there's a great deal of uncertainty about which price is right for the current prospects. Solana Treasury Strategy The company's investor presentation from May describes the current path, citing MSTR as an inspiration. MSTR effectively leverages its equity to accumulate BTC at a faster rate than they can dilute, creating what they've dubbed ""BTC yield."" May 2025 Investor Presentation DeFi's idea is that shares of DFDV can be issued and sold, with proceeds to accumulate SOL and thus achieve ""SOL yield."" May 2025 Investor Presentation As SOL uses a proof-of-history approach, however, holders of SOL can actually earn a yield from this currency through staking, something not possible with BTC. DeFi claims to have an advantage here, compared to others. Thus, there's actually a true yield that their treasury of SOL can earn, plus the less-true yield from cloning MSTR's approach with BTC. May 2025 Investor Presentation Similar to MSTR, they also plan to start issuing convertible securities to accumulate SOL. Future Outlook I don't think DFDV is likely to be investable over time. If anything, it effectively becomes a derivative of SOL, as MSTR has with BTC. May 2025 Investor Presenation As they themselves show, SOL is often just as volatile as MSTR. DFDV therefore has potential to have even more magnified returns than MSTR. SOL 5Y Price History (Seeking Alpha) This can be great on the upside and scary in the other direction. In the last five years, SOL has been worth as much as $250, crashed to $10, risen back to $250, and now currently sits around $145. Some of these declines have been driven by outages in the Solana network, which is a weakness that really doesn't come with BTC, whose second and last outage occurred in 2013 . Solana, meanwhile, has had seven . While patches have been made to protect against this, it's still concerning. Similar events in the future could heavily punish DFDV. May 2025 Investor Presentation At the end of the day, this isn't a company that generates cash flow from a proper operation. Not many companies will be so eager to use the phrase ""financially engineer"" in their presentations. While they criticize Coinbase Global ( COIN ) for the limited staking rewards it offers, as an exchange it actually generates cash from a service. It has fundamentals on which it can fall back. DeFi seems like it depends heavily on the market pricing SOL up over time. MSTR vs. BTC 6M Price Returns (Seeking Alpha) As recent price action in MSTR shows us, when BTC is down, MSTR goes down much more sharply. Now imagine a more extreme situation for SOL and DFDV. Would DFDV even be able to stay in business, is there a serious enough setback? It's worth considering. May 2025 Investor Presentation While the SOL NAV was only $106M in May, the current market cap of $365M. The company has also not announced any more SOL purchases like they had prior to that, so unless they decided to change that policy, it seems like the shares are at a premium and only have upside if they succeed in the strategy. Conclusion I think we're going to see a lot more companies forming ""treasuries"" of cryptocurrencies in order to create ""crypto yield,"" whether it's a currency that produces actual yield like SOL or not. Over time, some of these companies may do well, but I don't see a compelling case to buy as I would stock in a company with ordinary operations. This is why COIN is the only crypto investment I've ever rated Buy. DFDV seems like it's more situationally useful for traders. For that reason, I give the stock a fairly cautious Hold rating.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4797155-defi-development-the-microstrategy-of-solana?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING","DFDV",cryptocompare

2025-06-25T12:43:08,"XRP Echoes Bullish Pattern That Came Ahead of BTC Price Breakout to $100K","This is a daily technical analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. Imagine a ship caught in a fierce storm, battered by large waves and swaying wildly yet staying afloat. It indicates that beneath the turmoil, resilience persists, suggesting that smooth sailing will follow once the storm passes. Similarly, when an asset's price refuses to decline despite bearish signals from key indicators, it suggests underlying strength and a potential bull run ahead. That's the current situation in the XRP market and mirrors conditions in the bitcoin market that foreshadowed BTC's historic run higher from $70,000 to $100,000 late last year. Let's have a look at both. XRP is the payments-focused cryptocurrency used by the Fintech company Ripple to facilitate cross-border transactions. The two, however, are not interchangeable. XRP defies bearish MACD histogram The underlying strength in XRP is evident from the way prices have been behaving relative to the MACD histogram in recent weeks. The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram is an exponential moving average (EMA)--based trend-following indicator widely tracked by both institutions and retail investors to identify price trends and measure trend momentum. The MACD bars crossing from negative to positive indicate a bullish shift in momentum, suggesting the start of an uptrend in the asset's price. A crossover below zero suggests otherwise, with consecutive deeper bars indicating a strengthening of the downward momentum. XRP's weekly chart MACD, used by traders to gauge long-term trends, crossed below zero in the first week of March, signaling a renewed downtrend. However, a pronounced downtrend has not yet materialized, with prices mainly trading back and forth between $2 and $2.60, barring occasional short-lived dips below $2. The divergence, marked by persistently bearish MACD and largely directionless trading, hints at bullish vibes or resilience beneath the surface – bulls successfully absorbing supply. This prolonged divergence means the potential for a sudden bull revival and price increases. The bull case is supported by the upward-sloping 50-, 100- and 200-week simple moving averages (SMA). BTC defied bearish MACD in 2024 The above-discussed divergence in XRP is similar to the conditions in BTC last year when the weekly MACD kept flashing red throughout the Summer. At the same time, BTC traded range-bound, barring occasional short-lived dips below $60,000. CoinDesk noted the divergence in mid-September last year when BTC changed hands at around $59,000. Weeks later, BTC rose to $70,000, eventually topping the same in November to hit record highs above $100,000. Let's see if XRP follows the same path.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/25/xrp-echoes-bullish-bitcoin-pattern-that-presaged-breakout-to-usd100k,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","Markets|XRP|Bitcoin|Technical Analysis|Markets|market analysis|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-25T12:41:42,"Riding the breakout: How to trade assets making new all-time highs with Dentoshi","The crypto market has a reputation for being fast-moving and volatile – but when assets begin testing and breaking new all-time highs (ATHs), traders face some of the most critical decisions of their careers. In a recent Twitter/X Spaces session hosted by Kraken VP Growth Matt Howells-Barby, veteran trader @ Dentoshi unpacked the mindset, tools and strategies she uses to navigate those conditions. Whether you’re a trend trader, a meme coin speculator or someone sitting on the sidelines wondering when to act, Dentoshi explains strategies and tactics for managing risk and riding momentum without falling into emotional traps. Trading the all-time high break When Bitcoin hit a new ATH on May 22 , the reaction was brief but euphoric. For Dentoshi, whose BTC holdings are largely in cold storage , the moment was more of a signal to watch “ what comes next – especially for altcoins .” History suggests that after BTC sets an ATH, a rotation into alts often follows. But there are a few things we need to see on the charts for this to happen, like a drop in Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) and ETH/BTC strength , but these things have not happened yet. Dentoshi cautions: “ This cycle is different .” “Institutional capital is in the game now, and much of it enters via ETFs – not onchain or through altcoin speculation. That changes the liquidity dynamics.” Trading with @KrakenPro on the go @Dentoshi pic.twitter.com/k5j1VsHC9R — Kraken Exchange (@krakenfx) November 18, 2024 Trading the chop: Knowing when to step back One of the session’s recurring themes was the importance of understanding market conditions . In sideways, choppy markets – like much of early 2025 – Dentoshi scales down activity significantly. “Sometimes you can be right about the level but wrong about the timing.” Instead of trying to catch every bounce, Dentoshi waits for confirmation of trend shifts , especially via EMAs (exponential moving averages) analysis. Position sizing and the art of timing Dentoshi referenced a famous tweet by pseudonymous trader GCR that sums up her key philosophy: ""During altcoin cycles, you should maximize risk at the the beginning, and slowly reduce it over time, but most people do the opposite"". -GCR — Route 2 FI (@Route2FI) November 11, 2024 “Too many traders do the opposite: Hesitate during the early breakout, then go all-in near the top.” Dentoshi warns against behavior that leads to this result: how greed often grows alongside market confidence , leading to poor entries late in the move. “Be realistic about targets, manage expectations during consolidation, and take profits without blindly rotating gains into new positions.” Manage risk in the bull run with trailing stops on @KrakenPro Learn how @Dentoshi uses them in combination with EMA chart analysis pic.twitter.com/WgBslCnuC7 — Kraken Exchange (@krakenfx) November 25, 2024 Tools of the trade: EMAs, dominance and narrative momentum So how does she separate the false starts from the real trends? Dentoshi relies heavily on: EMAs for trend direction and exhaustion points BTC and ETH dominance metrics Volume and chart patterns Narrative momentum : If narratives rotate quickly and fail to stick, the market likely isn’t ready for sustained altcoin rallies. Watch @Dentoshi dive deep into Patterns: Breaking down flags and pennants like a Pro. Showing a classic bullish play. Setting a target price using Flagpoles. That lady can draw pic.twitter.com/te30cYR1ru — Kraken Pro (@krakenpro) April 11, 2025 In strong markets, trending narratives last longer . Memecoins can ride these waves when sentiment and volume align. Journaling, focus and staying sane Dentoshi is adamant about mental hygiene. She journals trades (ideally 2–3 times per week), sets clear entry/exit rules , and tunes out Twitter noise by following a curated list of serious traders. She also emphasizes the need for low-dopamine hobbies – activities that help break the constant feedback loop of screen-watching and FOMO. “Have a plan, not a prediction,” she said. “There are no safe entry points; only safe strategies.” What’s next: Summer slowdown or altcoin renaissance? With ETH in a tight 25-day range and Bitcoin hanging between key EMA levels, Dentoshi is watching for signs of breakout strength. Until then, her playbook remains cautious: Mark key levels Set price alerts Wait for volume and trend confirmation If ETH breaks out, we could see an altcoin resurgence. If not, a long, slow summer could be on the horizon. Price alerts on @KrakenPro Enabled https://t.co/aRJF10On2o — Kraken Exchange (@krakenfx) April 2, 2024 Trading ATHs: Final thoughts Trading ATH breakouts requires more than guts. It demands discipline, a clear system and an ability to avoid noise.

2025-06-25T12:40:30,"Unlocking Bitcoin Investment: The Blockchain Group’s Strategic $4.72M Capital Raise","BitcoinWorld Unlocking Bitcoin Investment: The Blockchain Group’s Strategic $4.72M Capital Raise In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, significant moves by established players often signal deeper market trends. Recently, The Blockchain Group, a prominent French blockchain company, made headlines with a strategic capital raise aimed squarely at increasing its Bitcoin investment . This development isn’t just about one company’s financial maneuvers; it offers a compelling glimpse into the evolving landscape of institutional interest in digital assets. What’s Driving This Significant Bitcoin Investment? The news is straightforward yet impactful: The Blockchain Group announced it has successfully issued 800,690 new ordinary shares, raising a substantial €4.07 million (approximately $4.72 million). The explicit purpose? To acquire more Bitcoin (BTC). This isn’t their first foray into BTC; the firm already holds a notable 1,728 BTC. So, what compels a publicly traded company to double down on an asset known for its volatility? Long-Term Conviction: This move signals a strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition as a store of value and a hedge against inflation, mirroring sentiments from other major corporations. Strategic Positioning: By increasing its crypto holdings , The Blockchain Group positions itself to benefit from potential future appreciation of Bitcoin, aligning its balance sheet with the growth of the digital economy. Market Opportunity: Companies often seize opportunities during periods they perceive as undervalued or ripe for accumulation, indicating a strategic timing behind this raise. The Blockchain Group’s Strategic Move: Boosting Crypto Holdings For those unfamiliar, The Blockchain Group is a French company actively involved in various aspects of the blockchain ecosystem. Their decision to allocate fresh capital directly into Bitcoin is a powerful statement. It’s a tangible demonstration of how traditional financial structures are adapting to and embracing the decentralized future. Let’s look at their current and projected holdings, assuming the entire raised capital is converted to BTC at a hypothetical price (for illustrative purposes, let’s use a round number like $60,000 per BTC, though actual acquisition prices will vary): Metric Current Status Potential After Raise (Illustrative) Existing BTC Holdings 1,728 BTC 1,728 BTC Capital Raised N/A $4.72 Million Estimated New BTC Acquired (at $60k/BTC) N/A ~78.67 BTC Total Potential BTC Holdings 1,728 BTC ~1,806.67 BTC This table illustrates the direct impact of their fundraising on their balance sheet, significantly increasing their exposure to the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Is This a New Wave of Institutional Adoption for Bitcoin? The Blockchain Group’s action is not an isolated incident. Over the past few years, we’ve witnessed a growing trend of institutional adoption , with major corporations, investment funds, and even sovereign entities adding Bitcoin to their reserves. This includes companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and numerous ETFs now holding significant amounts of BTC. What does this collective embrace signify? Validation of Bitcoin: Each institutional entry lends further credibility to Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, moving it beyond speculative retail interest. Increased Liquidity: More institutional capital flowing into Bitcoin markets can lead to deeper liquidity, potentially reducing volatility over time. Shifting Perceptions: It helps shift the public and regulatory perception of Bitcoin from a niche, risky asset to a mainstream investment vehicle. This ongoing trend suggests that Bitcoin is increasingly viewed not just as a technology, but as a foundational element of future global finance. The Blockchain Group’s move reinforces this narrative, signaling confidence in Bitcoin’s enduring value. What Does This Mean for the Future of Digital Assets? The implications of such strategic investments extend far beyond Bitcoin itself, influencing the broader landscape of digital assets . As more institutional money flows into the crypto space, several outcomes become more likely: Benefits: Enhanced Stability: Greater institutional participation can bring more stability and maturity to the crypto markets, reducing extreme price swings. Regulatory Clarity: As institutions engage more, the pressure for clearer and more comprehensive regulatory frameworks will likely increase, fostering a safer environment for all participants. Innovation and Infrastructure: Institutional demand often spurs further investment in underlying infrastructure, security, and innovative applications within the blockchain ecosystem. Challenges: Market Centralization Concerns: While beneficial for stability, large institutional holdings could lead to concerns about centralization of control over certain assets. Regulatory Hurdles: Navigating complex and evolving global regulations remains a significant challenge for companies looking to increase their crypto exposure. Volatility Risk: Despite growing maturity, digital assets, including Bitcoin, remain subject to significant price volatility, posing risks to institutional balance sheets. For individual investors, observing these institutional moves can provide valuable insights. It suggests that a long-term, strategic approach to digital assets might be increasingly validated by major players. It also highlights the growing importance of understanding the fundamentals behind these assets, rather than just short-term price action. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards a Decentralized Future The Blockchain Group’s decision to raise $4.72 million specifically to bolster its Bitcoin holdings is a powerful testament to the growing institutional confidence in the leading cryptocurrency. It’s a strategic maneuver that not only strengthens the company’s own financial position but also contributes to the broader narrative of Bitcoin’s legitimization and integration into mainstream finance. As more companies follow suit, we can expect the digital asset landscape to continue evolving, bringing both exciting opportunities and new challenges. This move underscores the belief that Bitcoin is not just a passing trend, but a fundamental component of the future financial system.

The recent bullish price action is mainly driven by Bitcoin’s dominance , which has risen to 65.3%.

Solana coin price could reach a potential high of $400 in 2025. With a potential surge, the SOL price could hit $1,351 by 2030. Solana is coming true to its community-claimed title, “Ethereum-Killer,” as it gradually surpasses Ethereum in the decentralized market. In a recent feat, Solana has signed an MoU with Kazakhstan to launch Central Asia’s first Solana Economic Zone. Talking about numbers, the Solana price currently trades at a discount of 50.52% from its ATH of $ 294.33.

With RSI at 46.21 and price trading below the 20-day SMA ($148.56), SOL shows consolidation signs. The Bollinger Bands indicate a potential range, with the lower bound at $132, suggesting a potential low of $130. If bulls reclaim the 20-day SMA, average price may hover around $150, and in a bullish breakout, potential high could reach $165. Overall, price action remains range-bound barring major volume inflows. Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High July $130 $150 $165 Solana Price Prediction 2025 As per CoinGlass , Solana leads the crypto derivatives market with a massive $6.14 billion in open interest, far outpacing all other tokens. This indicates strong trader confidence and sustained capital inflow into SOL positions. Other notable projects like FARTCOIN, LINK, and UNI trail behind with open interest between $460M–$540M. The dominance of SOL on both the treemap and bar chart suggests it remains a favorite among leveraged traders, potentially fueling heightened volatility and price action in the near term. If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400. Conversely, stricter regulations or a network congestion setback could pull the price toward its annual low of $250. Considering the present market sentiment, the SOL crypto could settle with an average trading price of around $325.

2025-06-25T12:37:16,"Crypto Price Analysis 6-25: BITCOIN: BTC, ETHEREUM: ETH, SOLANA: SOL, CARDANO: ADA, BITTENSOR: TAO, JUPITER: JUP","Despite mixed price action, the crypto market extended its gains for a second day, with some tokens trading in the red. However, Bitcoin’s (BTC) push higher dragged the market up as well. BTC reclaimed $106,000 on Tuesday as market sentiment improved, moving beyond the moving averages to $106,138. Altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH) , Ripple (XRP) , Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) , performed even better, posting double-digit gains. ETH is up over 10% since Monday, reclaiming $2,400 and moving to its current level of $2,450. XRP has been down nearly 1% over the past 24 hours, while Solana (SOL) has been marginally up, trading around $145. Dogecoin (DOGE) is down $0.50%, and ADA is down almost 2%, trading at $0.580. Stellar (XLM) , Toncoin (TON) , Hedera (HBAR) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable declines. However, Chainlink (LINK) and Litecoin (LTC) bucked the bearish trend to trade in positive territory. Dow Jones Up 500 Points As Ceasefire Holds US stocks have recovered as tensions in the Middle East lowered, creating positive, risk-on sentiment among investors. Israel and Iran announced a fragile ceasefire, which is holding for the moment. As a result, the Dow Jones rose 470 points or 1.1%, reclaiming pre-war levels. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 rose 1.05%, while the tech-focused Nasdaq rose 1.43%. Market watchers and traders are hopeful that hostilities will cease. President Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran and also pressured the former to stop its attacks against Iran. An escalation of the conflict threatened the global oil economy. Escalation became a possibility after the US struck key Iranian installations. Iran threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz in response, a move that could push oil prices to historic highs. However, with hostilities easing, crude oil prices dropped to $64 per barrel, down over 5% in one day. Crude oil traded around $75 at the height of the conflict. Fed To Wait Before Deciding On Rate Cuts With tensions in the Middle East under control, markets turned their attention to the Federal Reserve and interest rate cuts. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said during his testimony before Congress that the Fed plans to wait for more information before making changes to interest rates. Powell stated he is still concerned about the potential impact of Trump’s tariff policies, which could push inflation higher and lower growth. Powell also said the impact of inflation could be short-term or persistent, each requiring a different response. However, the Fed Chair stated that rate cuts could happen sooner if inflation stays low or the unemployment rate rises. Mastercard Announces Partnership With Chainlink Chainlink has teamed up with Mastercard to allow over $3 billion Mastercard users to buy crypto directly on-chain. The collaboration aims to make crypto more accessible to newer users. The partnership is powered by a network of Web3 partners, including Shift4 Payments, Swapper Finance, XSwap, and ZeroHash. ZeroHash will manage on-chain services and liquidity, allowing users to exchange fiat for crypto conveniently and safely. Meanwhile, Swapper Finance uses account abstraction to give users more control while keeping the overall user experience simple. Sergey Nazarov, the co-founder of Chainlink, stated, “This is the type of traditional finance and decentralized finance convergence that Chainlink was built to make possible.” Mastercard has shown an increasing interest in crypto. The payments giant has also partnered with Kraken to issue crypto debit cards in the UK and Europe. It has also collaborated with MetaMask to launch a crypto card offering self-custody. Coinbase Claims It Helped In Key Secret Service Operation Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has claimed it played a key role in a US Secret Service investigation, resulting in the seizure of $225 million linked to several crypto investment scams. The United States Department of Justice recently filed to seize over $225 million in crypto recovered by the Secret Service. According to investigators, the funds were stolen by pig butchering scammers and was the largest seizure in the agency’s history. Coinbase and several other exchanges joined in an “investigative sprint,” helping the Secret Service identify scam victims, analyze chain flows, and build a case to seize crypto. According to Coinbase, its team tracked millions in crypto transactions from illicit wallets and other account activity, helping flag scam victims for the Secret Service. “This blockchain analysis and subpoena records production allowed the USSS to identify more than 130 Coinbase customers who were unknowingly defrauded, representing $2.3 million in losses.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) extended its gains for a third consecutive day to reclaim $106,000 and move to its current level of $106,683. Analysts believe if the current bullish sentiment persists, the flagship cryptocurrency could push to $110,000. BTC plunged to a low of $98,385 on Sunday as hostilities in the Middle East peaked. However, it stabilized after reaching this level and reclaimed $100,000 to settle at $100,982. Market sentiment turned bullish on Monday after President Trump announced a ceasefire. As a result, BTC surged over 4% to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,442. The price continued to push higher on Tuesday, crossing the moving averages and $106,000 to $106,138. BTC has regained its footing this week after a weekend that saw it plunge to multi-month lows. Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, attributed BTC’s recovery to stabilizing geopolitical conditions in the Middle East after Israel and Iran agreed to a ceasefire. “Bitcoin has seen a sharp rally following the announcement of a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, recovering from a recent dip amid heightened geopolitical tensions.” He also highlighted Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s commitment to tackle inflation, noting that it could impact liquidity in the short to mid-term. “The Fed chief has reiterated a commitment to tackle inflation and is not in a hurry to cut interest rates, which could affect liquidity in the short to mid-term.” According to analysts, if BTC continues its upward trend, it could extend its rally toward its all-time high. BTC ended the previous weekend with a marginal increase and settled at $105,561. The price raced to an intraday high of 108,939 on Monday as buyers attempted to overwhelm sellers. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and settled at $106,808, ultimately registering an increase of 1.18%. BTC lost momentum on Tuesday, dropping over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and $105,000 to settle at $104,519.

BTC plunged below $100,000 on Sunday, falling to an intraday low of $98,385 after the US conducted airstrikes on key Iranian sites. However, it recovered to reclaim $100,000 and settle at $100,982.

The current session sees BTC marginally up, trading around $106,428. Analysts believe BTC could push to $110,000 or even higher if it maintains momentum. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) is marginally down during the ongoing session, losing momentum after failing to cross $2,500 on Tuesday. Despite a marginal decline during the ongoing session, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency has made a strong recovery this week after a weekend that saw it plunge to a low of $2,119 as hostilities in the Middle East peaked. However, President Trump announced a ceasefire, pushing market sentiment into bullish territory. As a result, ETH rallied on Monday, rising over 8% to reclaim $2,400 and settle at $2,413. ETH extended its gains on Tuesday, rising 1.51% to $2,450. However, a move beyond $2,500 failed to materialize. Analysts believe a breakout above the $2,460-$2,500 level could indicate a potential rally. However, sellers have prevented an upward push for now. ETH has recovered nearly 10% over the past couple of days. ETH started the previous week in the red despite surging to an intraday high of $2,680. It lost momentum after reaching this level and dropped to $2,544, ultimately registering a marginal decline. Price action remained bearish on Tuesday, falling 1.31% and settling at $2,511.

ETH continued to push higher on Tuesday, rising 1.51% to $2,450. However, it has lost momentum during the ongoing session, with the price marginally down. The RSI is hovering around its neutral level, indicating waning bullish momentum. Buyers must push the RSI above its neutral level to sustain ETH’s bullish trajectory. If buyers regain control, the price could move beyond $2,500. However, if sellers retain control it could dip below $2,400. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Unlike BTC and ETH, Solana (SOL) has continued to push higher during the ongoing session as it looks to reclaim $150. SOL has registered a stunning rally this week, up over 11% since Monday. It fell to a low of $126 on Sunday as bearish sentiment intensified over the weekend thanks to the Israel-Iran conflict. However, it recovered after President Trump announced an immediate ceasefire. As a result, SOL rallied nearly 10% to reclaim $140 and settle at $144.

However, SOL is marginally down during the ongoing session as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control. If buyers regain control, SOL could push to $150. On the other hand, it could drop below $140 if bearish sentiment returns. Cardano (ADA) Price Analysis Cardano (ADA) rebounded this week after spending last week in the red. It looks to ride the latest market rally and reverse recent seller dominance. ADA started the previous week with a marginal drop to $0.630.

2025-06-25T12:30:26,"Ethereum ETFs Witness Remarkable $71.3M Inflow Surge","BitcoinWorld Ethereum ETFs Witness Remarkable $71.3M Inflow Surge The digital asset landscape is buzzing with renewed optimism as U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs continue to attract significant capital. On June 24, these groundbreaking investment vehicles recorded a combined net inflow of an impressive $71.3 million, marking the second consecutive day of positive momentum. This influx signals growing institutional confidence and investor interest in Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. It’s a compelling development that underscores the evolving acceptance of digital assets within traditional finance. What’s Driving the Surge in Spot Ethereum ETFs? The recent approval of Spot Ethereum ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been a pivotal moment, opening doors for a broader range of investors to gain exposure to Ethereum without directly holding the cryptocurrency. This regulatory clarity has injected a fresh wave of enthusiasm into the market. Investors, both retail and institutional, are increasingly recognizing Ethereum’s foundational role in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and a myriad of other blockchain applications. The ability to invest through a regulated, familiar product like an ETF removes many of the complexities and perceived risks associated with direct crypto ownership, making it an attractive option for those looking to diversify their portfolios. Key factors contributing to this surge include: Regulatory Validation: The SEC’s approval lends significant legitimacy to Ethereum as an asset class. Accessibility: ETFs simplify the investment process, allowing participation through traditional brokerage accounts. Institutional Appetite: Large financial institutions are now able to allocate capital more easily, leading to substantial inflows. Market Maturation: The cryptocurrency market, particularly Ethereum, is seen as maturing, offering more stable investment opportunities compared to its earlier, more volatile days. Diving Deeper: Who’s Leading the ETH ETF Charge? While the overall picture for ETH ETFs is overwhelmingly positive, a closer look reveals interesting dynamics among the individual funds. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) emerged as the clear leader, pulling in a staggering $98 million in inflows on June 24 alone. This performance is a testament to BlackRock’s immense market presence and investor trust, mirroring its dominant role in the Bitcoin ETF space. BlackRock, as one of the world’s largest asset managers, brings unparalleled credibility and reach, often becoming the preferred choice for institutional investors seeking exposure to new asset classes. However, not all funds experienced the same positive trajectory. Fidelity’s Ethereum Fund (FETH) recorded a net outflow of $26.7 million on the same day. While this might seem concerning at first glance, it’s important to view such movements in context. Outflows can occur for various reasons, including profit-taking by early investors, portfolio rebalancing, or simply individual investor decisions that do not necessarily reflect a broader negative sentiment towards the asset class. In a nascent market like spot Ethereum ETFs, it’s natural to see some volatility in individual fund flows as investors adjust their positions. Understanding the Significance of Ethereum Inflows The consistent positive Ethereum Inflows are more than just daily statistics; they represent a fundamental shift in how mainstream finance views and interacts with digital assets. For Ethereum, these inflows can have several profound implications: Price Support: Increased demand from ETFs can create buying pressure, potentially supporting or driving up Ethereum’s price. Liquidity: Higher trading volumes and larger asset bases in ETFs contribute to greater market liquidity for ETH. Ecosystem Growth: As more capital flows into Ethereum, it can fuel further development and innovation within its extensive ecosystem of decentralized applications. Mainstream Adoption: The success of these ETFs serves as a powerful indicator of Ethereum’s growing acceptance as a legitimate investment asset, paving the way for even wider adoption. This trend echoes the journey of Bitcoin ETFs, which, after their launch, saw significant inflows contributing to Bitcoin’s price appreciation and overall market validation. Ethereum’s path appears to be following a similar trajectory, albeit with its unique characteristics tied to its utility as a programmable blockchain. The Strategic Role of BlackRock ETHA in Market Dynamics BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust, or BlackRock ETHA , is quickly establishing itself as a dominant force in the nascent spot Ethereum ETF market. BlackRock’s reputation for innovation and its vast network of institutional clients give it a significant edge. Their strong inflows suggest that a considerable portion of institutional capital entering the Ethereum ETF space is choosing BlackRock as their preferred vehicle. This is not surprising, given BlackRock’s track record of launching successful financial products and its commitment to providing secure and efficient investment solutions. Their entry and subsequent leadership in this market segment underscore the institutional demand for regulated crypto products and could set a benchmark for other asset managers. Navigating the Nuances: The Case of Fidelity FETH While BlackRock captured the headlines with its large inflows, the $26.7 million outflow from Fidelity FETH highlights the diverse strategies and investor behaviors within the market. Fidelity, a respected name in asset management, has been a long-standing proponent of digital assets, demonstrating a commitment to the space through various initiatives. An outflow, especially in the early days of a new product, can be attributed to several factors: Early Investor Profit-Taking: Some investors might have bought in anticipation of the ETF launch and are now realizing gains. Portfolio Rebalancing: Large institutional investors often rebalance their portfolios based on risk assessments or strategic shifts. Smaller Fund Volatility: Newer or smaller funds might experience more pronounced daily fluctuations in flows compared to larger, more established ones. It’s crucial for investors to look beyond single-day movements and consider the broader trend and Fidelity’s overall commitment to the digital asset space. The competitive landscape for Ethereum ETFs is just beginning to unfold, and various funds will find their niche among different investor segments. Actionable Insights for Investors For investors considering exposure to Ethereum through ETFs, these developments offer several insights: Long-Term View: Focus on the long-term potential of Ethereum and its ecosystem rather than daily price or flow fluctuations. Diversification: Spot Ethereum ETFs can serve as a valuable diversification tool within a balanced investment portfolio. Due Diligence: While ETFs offer convenience, it’s still essential to understand the underlying asset (Ethereum) and the specific fund’s structure and fees. Market Volatility: Be prepared for continued volatility in the broader crypto market, even with the increasing institutionalization. Conclusion: A New Era for Ethereum Investment The consistent positive inflows into U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs, particularly the remarkable performance of BlackRock’s ETHA, signal a pivotal moment for Ethereum and the broader cryptocurrency market. These inflows are not just numbers; they represent growing institutional validation, increased accessibility for investors, and a powerful step towards mainstream adoption of digital assets. While individual fund flows may fluctuate, the overarching trend points to a robust and expanding interest in Ethereum as a legitimate and valuable investment. As the market matures, the role of these ETFs in shaping Ethereum’s future price action and ecosystem growth will undoubtedly become even more pronounced, ushering in a new era for digital asset investment.

2025-06-25T12:30:20,"Crypto Rally Or Crash? Powell Just Made July The Market’s Make-Or-Break","Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s appearance on Capitol Hill Tuesday left risk-asset traders with a single, binary question: does the most interest-sensitive summer in years end with a crypto breakout or a macro-driven crash? In a prepared statement, Powell stressed that “inflation has eased significantly from its highs in mid-2022 but remains somewhat elevated,” adding that the Federal Open Market Committee is “well-positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance.” Crypto’s Fate May Be Sealed In July For crypto markets already oscillating on every nuance of policy guidance, the message was clear: the next four weeks—anchored by the 12 July CPI release and the 19 July payrolls report—will decide whether July’s FOMC delivers relief or a reality check. POWELL: WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE MEANINGFUL TARIFF INFLATION EFFECTS JUNE, JULY AUGUST POWELL: IF WE DON’T SEE THAT, THAT WOULD LEAD TO CUTTING EARLIER — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) June 24, 2025 Powell’s caution sits atop a rare public split inside the Board itself. Governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, both Trump appointees, have openly argued that tariff-related price spikes are likely to be “one-time shifts” and therefore should not stand in the way of an early cut—potentially as soon as the 30 July meeting. Seven of their colleagues disagree, laying out projections that keep policy unchanged through December. Powell, for his part, told lawmakers: “I don’t think we need to be in any rush, because the economy is still strong.” Related Reading: Crypto Bull Run Over? Here’s What A Top Trader Just Said Markets reacted by flattening the front end of the curve. Two-year Treasury yields fell to 3.806 percent, while the benchmark 10-year dipped to 4.285 percent—both lows not seen since early May—after the testimony and a surprise cease-fire in the Middle East turbo-charged a global “risk-on” bid. Yet expectations for July remain finely balanced: CME FedWatch shows that traders have whittled the probability of a first 25-basis-point cut to roughly 19%. Crypto traded the cross-currents rather than the headline. Bitcoin, which had cratered to $99,000 on Monday, reclaimed $106,000 by Wednesday morning, mirroring the rebound in equities and high-beta currencies as the dollar slumped on falling yields. Ethereum, meanwhile, held above $2,400—even as Powell’s tone was widely described as hawkish. The broader crypto complex moved in sympathy, with BNB punching through $644 and Solana stabilising near $146.

All eyes on the July CPI print.” Nic from CoinBureau added that July “is in play—maybe—but nothing’s locked in,” as Powell’s testimony brought no big surprises. Meanwhile, Jim Bianco commented: “Trump appointees Waller and Bowman are suggesting a July cut. Powell is reiterating ‘no.’ Will the July FOMC meeting see at least two dissenters?” For now, Powell’s “watch and wait” stance has bought the FOMC four more weeks of optionality. If July inflation confirms the down-trend, the policy door swings open, and the next rally for crypto could morph into a full-blown melt-up. If it doesn’t, the crash could come just as fast. As Byzantine General put it, the market “got clarity.” What it did not get is comfort. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $106,892.

The BTC price plunged to lows of $98,200 following US attacks on Iran but quickly rebounded and is up nearly 9% in the past 3 days after ceasefire talks emerged. A ceasefire has restored some confidence in the market, and it is now inching towards retesting its ATH of $112K. On the behavior of BTC price action, a report on Tuesday by K33 research report reveals that the 30-day ETF flows and BTC returns share an “R² of 0.80”, indicating that spot Bitcoin ETF flows remain a key market driver. Similarly, the 11-day streak in US spot Bitcoin ETFs with recent $588 million inflows on June 24th proves the point. Since June 10th, over $2.2 billion in inflows have been measured, which signals tremendous institutional interest.

2025-06-25T12:21:31,"Galaxy Digital: Crypto Cycles And AI Servers Collide (Rating Upgrade)","Summary Upgrading Galaxy Digital to buy after the recent pullback, as risk-reward has improved and technicals look supportive for a new uptrend. Helios data center transition offers stable, high-margin recurring revenue, reducing reliance on volatile crypto markets and boosting long-term sustainability. Valuation is reasonable at current levels, with potential for 36–37% upside if crypto market sentiment improves. Key risks remain: heavy crypto dependence, Helios execution uncertainty, and potential dilution. I recommend buying at $18.3, not higher. Introduction I have covered Galaxy Digital Inc. ( GLXY ) twice before, once under the ticker symbol GLXY on the TSE calling it a buy and recently as GLXY on the Nasdaq issuing a hold rating . The performances since then are depicted below. GLXY Performance after Buy rating GLXY Performance after Hold rating I did rate them a hold on May 19 but did not sell any shares as I believe the stock has more upside potential this year. After the recent pullback, I do see a more favorable risk-reward ratio in buying GLXY. Therefore, I am upgrading my rating to a buy again. Why I Am Long Again Recent momentum for Galaxy Digital has been halted by the combination of a crypto price correction and the pricing of a new share offering totaling around $500M. Proceeds of the set offering will be used to build out their Helios data center Infrastructure. What I did not cover so far due to length constraints is the Data Center opportunities GLXY has. Therefore, this will be the focus of this article. It is, however, quite significant to the company, as shown in their division of business fields into Digital Assets , which includes Global Markets, Asset Management, and Investment Banking, and Data Centers , which covers their Helios Data Center in Dickens County, TX, initially intended to be used for Bitcoin mining but now being repurposed to host AI HPC services. Demand for data centers is set to grow at almost 300% throughout 2030. Similarly, data center IT CapEx is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 23%, reaching $800B in 2028, per McKinsey. Even if these optimistic assumptions are halved, this would be a very attractive market for Galaxy Digital to enter. GLXY IR Their 15-year agreement with CoreWeave marks a shift in their revenue model. At an estimated $900M annual recurring revenue projected to fully materialize into 2027, they are now less susceptible to crypto price volatility. These revenues are both stable and of a high-margin nature, as GLXY projects 90%+ EBITDA margins for them due to their triple lease agreement structure. Conservatively estimated, this could net GLXY an additional $500M of net income per year. More capacity should be gradually unlocked and a full capacity of 2,500 MW could be reached in 2035, which at a 90% utilization rate and $150 per kW/month could earn them a total of $2.4B in ARR. This could in turn translate to $800-900M of net income from data centers annually, assuming higher depreciation costs causing EBITDA margins to decrease a little bit. This seems to be a much better field of business to operate in rather than Bitcoin mining, and I'm glad they're transitioning. Bitcoin mining is incredibly dependent on Bitcoin prices and, excluding mining efficiency increases, needs Bitcoin prices to double every four years just to earn the same revenues and profits. Still, one cannot deny the fact that Galaxy's stock price continues to be very dependent on Bitcoin prices, which drives the broader cryptocurrency market. In my latest BTC analysis, I shared the following: In the short term, though, I'm expecting a slight pullback to $97.5k or, in the worst case, to $93.5k We have now seen Bitcoin retrace to $98k. The worst might be behind us, but I continue to see a case for $93.5k as the worst-case current scenario. Either way, Bitcoin was super quick to regain the psychologically important $100k mark, despite economic and geopolitical uncertainties. In my view, this is clear evidence that the momentum is strong enough to reach further ATHs this year. Bitcoin's monthly RSI still has room for one further euphoric leap this year, as in all post-halving years, it has reached levels north of 90, whereas we have just seen 75 in 2024, a halving year. TradingView When it comes to valuation, traditional measures only get us so far. But looking at the P/B value, it has come down a little bit over the past few weeks. In my last coverage, it was at 2.7X and is now at 2.2X, which, in my view, is more reasonable and contains a little more room to run to the upside in case of continued crypto market euphoria. Specifically, I could see this value reach levels of 3X during peak investor sentiment, sometime around late Q3 or Q4 this year. This implies a short-term upside potential of 36%. Data by YCharts Since estimates are hard to find, I will do my own scenario analysis, based on FY 2025 and 2026. As long as a big portion of GLXY's profits stems from cyclical unrealized digital asset gains, they deserve to trade at high-single-digit P/E ratios, considering the unpredictability and the fact that profits vary greatly from true cashflows. As I assume rising digital asset prices in 2025, GLXY's net income would be boosted significantly by holdings gains as well as higher AUM, trading and lending usage, and advisory. I can imagine these developments to drive net income to around $700M in 2025, giving GLXY a forward P/E of 9.9X, which seems like the stock is neither over- nor undervalued for its 2025 upcoming performance. A continued crypto bull market is therefore already priced in. For 2026, gains or losses from the crypto markets are hard to forecast since it is supposed to be a crypto winter year. That could compromise net income drastically. They could, however, achieve revenues of $1B ($300M from financial services, $700M from Helios), which would put them at a forward P/S ratio of just below 7X, which is also reasonable considering their revenue will become much more predictable and be of high-margin nature. Checking technicals again, I realize that GLXY is trading at a crucial support of CAD25. The 200-day MA is also inching closer and could offer support. If these levels are lost, however, I could see the price moving down toward CAD20 (-20%). GLXY's recent drop of 30% also falls within its usual range of corrections since 2022. Weekly RSI down to 54 and daily RSI at 45 make me more confident at the start of a new uptrend. From then, it is important that they reclaim the descending trend line starting from their 2021 highs as support. Price has been rejected here three times on the daily chart in the last few weeks. Overcoming this resistance would give them a good foundation for trying to break through the key resistance zone at CAD34-36, which is my new preliminary price target, offering approximately 37% upside. TradingView Risks As mentioned in my prior coverage, GLXY's core risk remains its heavy dependence on crypto markets. A prolonged pullback in Bitcoin could lead to declining trading activity, lower AUMs, and negative net income. I particularly expect a lot of volatility going into 2026 where Galaxy will have to prove whether they can perform while reporting potentially large unrealized losses on their digital asset holdings. Additionally, Q1 2025's large loss as well as the Nasdaq listing increase the risk of shareholder dilution. Galaxy truly needs predictable revenues in order to safely be able to fund its costs and future expansions, so taking on debt and issuing a lot of shares is no longer necessary. Proceeds from share offerings are needed to restructure Helios and build it out in order to achieve maximum capacity. While likely, Helios has not proven to be economically viable and has not turned over a dime. This is set to change in the first half of next year but does remain an operational risk, as it is very hard to calculate ROI when investors don't precisely know about the amount of investment needed and whether projected capacity, revenues, and profits will truly materialize. Conclusion I am upgrading Galaxy Digital back to a Buy, though with less conviction than during the April lows. The recent pullback did improve the risk-reward ratio, but it is not as favorable as it was when prices hit $8-$12. Still, Galaxy Digital Inc. offers exposure to growing AI adoption, cryptocurrency financial services, and digital asset holdings growth. At today's prices, investors get the above-named sections for a fair valuation and decent technicals. Helios has the potential to make GLXY's financial profile more sustainable and less volatile over the coming years. This remains a 2025-focused investment, but I will continue to monitor both the Helios rollout and broader crypto dynamics closely. Depending on how these develop, Galaxy Digital could transition into a longer-term position for me, heading into 2026 and 2027. Disclaimer: At the time of writing this article, GLXY's stock price is at $18.3. I recommend buying at this price, not any higher.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4797143-galaxy-digital-crypto-cycles-and-ai-servers-collide?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING","GLXY|GLXY:CA",cryptocompare
2025-06-25T12:20:21,"US Spot Bitcoin ETFs: Remarkable $588.6M Inflow Ignites Market Optimism","BitcoinWorld US Spot Bitcoin ETFs: Remarkable $588.6M Inflow Ignites Market Optimism Are you keeping an eye on the pulse of the cryptocurrency market? If so, you’ve likely noticed a groundbreaking trend that continues to shape the landscape of digital asset investment. On June 24, US Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded an astonishing combined net inflow of $588.6 million, extending their impressive streak to 11 consecutive trading days of positive flows. This surge signals robust institutional and retail interest, painting a bright picture for the future of Bitcoin’s integration into traditional finance. What Are US Spot Bitcoin ETFs and Why Do They Matter? For those new to the space, a US Spot Bitcoin ETF is an exchange-traded fund that directly holds Bitcoin. Unlike futures ETFs, which track Bitcoin futures contracts, spot ETFs provide direct exposure to the price movements of the underlying asset itself. This distinction is crucial for investors who seek a more direct and less complex way to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of buying and storing the cryptocurrency directly. The approval and subsequent launch of these ETFs earlier this year marked a monumental shift. They offer several compelling advantages: Accessibility: Traditional investors can now easily invest in Bitcoin through their brokerage accounts, just like they would with stocks or other ETFs. Liquidity: ETFs trade on major stock exchanges, offering high liquidity and ease of buying and selling. Regulatory Oversight: Being regulated products, they offer a layer of investor protection that direct cryptocurrency purchases might not always provide. Diversification: They allow for easier portfolio diversification by adding exposure to digital assets within a traditional investment framework. The sustained crypto inflows into these products underscore their growing acceptance and utility as a bridge between the burgeoning digital asset world and conventional financial markets. Unpacking the Recent Crypto Inflows: A Closer Look at the Numbers The $588.6 million net inflow on June 24 is not just a number; it’s a testament to sustained investor confidence. According to data from Farside Investors, this marks the eleventh consecutive day of net inflows, indicating a persistent buying trend rather than a one-off event. Let’s break down which funds are leading the charge: BlackRock’s IBIT: Leading the pack by a significant margin, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) saw a massive $436.3 million in net inflows. This performance solidifies IBIT’s position as a dominant force in the Bitcoin ETF arena. Fidelity’s FBTC: Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) followed with a strong $85.2 million in net inflows, demonstrating its continued popularity among investors. ARK Invest’s ARKB: The ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) secured $43.8 million in net inflows, maintaining its steady appeal. Bitwise’s BITB: The Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) contributed $9.8 million to the total, showcasing consistent interest. Grayscale’s BTC: Notably, even Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which has historically seen outflows due to its conversion from a trust to an ETF, recorded a net inflow of $7.5 million. This is a significant shift and suggests that the selling pressure from GBTC might be subsiding, or even reversing. VanEck’s HODL: VanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL) also witnessed a respectable $6 million in net inflows. The remaining ETFs reported no change in their holdings for the day, highlighting the concentrated interest in these top performers. This distribution of inflows points to a clear preference for established and well-marketed funds, though the positive shift in Grayscale GBTC is particularly noteworthy. BlackRock IBIT Leads the Charge: What Makes it So Attractive? When we talk about the success of Bitcoin ETFs , it’s impossible to ignore the colossal impact of BlackRock IBIT . Its staggering $436.3 million inflow on June 24 alone accounts for the vast majority of the day’s total. BlackRock, as the world’s largest asset manager, brings unparalleled credibility, distribution networks, and marketing prowess to the table. Their reputation attracts a broad spectrum of investors, from large institutions to individual retail clients, who might feel more comfortable investing in Bitcoin through a familiar and trusted financial giant. The rapid accumulation of Bitcoin by IBIT since its launch has been a key driver of overall market sentiment. Its consistent positive flows suggest that a significant portion of new institutional capital is finding its way into the Bitcoin ecosystem through this specific vehicle. This isn’t just about BlackRock; it’s about the validation of Bitcoin as an investable asset class by a mainstream financial powerhouse. Grayscale GBTC’s Evolving Role in the Bitcoin ETF Landscape The journey of Grayscale GBTC has been unique among the spot Bitcoin ETFs. Prior to its conversion, GBTC operated as a trust, often trading at a significant discount or premium to its net asset value (NAV). Upon conversion to an ETF, many investors who had been locked into the trust, or who sought to arbitrage the discount, began to redeem their shares, leading to substantial outflows in the initial weeks. However, the recent $7.5 million net inflow for GBTC is a positive indicator. This shift could signify several things: Exhaustion of Selling Pressure: The initial wave of redemptions might be largely complete, with most of the profit-takers or discount-arbitragers having exited. New Inflows: New investors might be starting to see GBTC as a viable option, perhaps due to its slightly lower fee structure compared to its pre-ETF days, or simply as another entry point into the market. Market Maturation: As the overall Bitcoin ETF market matures, investors may become more comfortable diversifying their ETF holdings across different providers, including GBTC. The performance of GBTC will continue to be a key metric to watch, as its stabilization and potential for sustained inflows could further bolster overall confidence in the Bitcoin ETFs market. Benefits and Opportunities for Investors The sustained crypto inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs highlight several key benefits for investors: Ease of Access: No need for crypto exchanges, wallets, or complex security measures. Investors can buy and sell through their existing brokerage accounts. Institutional Participation: The ETF structure has opened the floodgates for large institutions, pension funds, and wealth managers to allocate capital to Bitcoin, which was previously challenging due to compliance and custody issues. This institutional backing adds legitimacy and stability to the market. Price Discovery: Increased liquidity and trading volume in regulated products can lead to more efficient price discovery for Bitcoin. Mainstream Adoption: The success of these ETFs accelerates Bitcoin’s journey into the mainstream, making it a more accepted and understood asset class. For investors looking to gain exposure to the digital asset space, these ETFs offer a compelling blend of innovation and traditional financial comfort. Navigating the Challenges and Risks of Bitcoin ETFs While the recent inflows are certainly cause for optimism, it’s crucial for investors to understand that investing in Bitcoin ETFs is not without its challenges and risks. Bitcoin, by its very nature, is a volatile asset. Its price can experience significant swings in short periods due to: Market Sentiment: News events, regulatory changes, and even social media trends can heavily influence Bitcoin’s price. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic conditions, inflation data, and interest rate decisions can impact investor appetite for risk assets like Bitcoin. Regulatory Uncertainty: While the US has approved spot ETFs, the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies globally is still evolving and can change, potentially impacting the market. Custody Risks: Although the ETF structure aims to mitigate this, the underlying Bitcoin still needs to be securely stored by custodians, introducing a layer of operational risk. Fees: Investors should be mindful of the expense ratios charged by ETFs, as these can eat into returns over time. Therefore, while the accessibility is a huge plus, investors should conduct thorough due diligence and consider their risk tolerance before allocating capital to these products. The Road Ahead: Future Outlook for Bitcoin ETFs and the Crypto Market The consistent crypto inflows into Bitcoin ETFs suggest a growing appetite for digital assets within regulated frameworks. This trend is likely to continue, with potential implications for the broader crypto market: Increased Institutional Adoption: The success of Bitcoin ETFs could pave the way for other single-asset crypto ETFs (like Ethereum ETFs, which are already seeing progress) and potentially multi-asset crypto ETFs. Bitcoin Price Impact: Sustained demand from ETFs, which are continuously accumulating Bitcoin, could put upward pressure on Bitcoin’s price, assuming supply remains constrained (e.g., post-halving effects). Market Maturation: The presence of regulated investment products fosters greater trust and understanding, contributing to the overall maturation of the cryptocurrency market. Innovation: As more traditional financial players enter the crypto space via ETFs, it could spur further innovation in financial products and services built around digital assets. The future looks promising for the integration of digital assets into global financial systems, with Bitcoin ETFs playing a pivotal role. Actionable Insights for Potential Investors If you’re considering investing in US Spot Bitcoin ETFs , here are some actionable insights: Research Thoroughly: Understand the specific ETF you’re investing in, including its expense ratio, custodian, and historical performance. Understand Volatility: Be prepared for price fluctuations. Bitcoin is known for its volatility, and its ETFs will reflect that. Diversify: While Bitcoin ETFs offer exposure to a new asset class, they should ideally be part of a diversified portfolio, not your sole investment. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, regulatory developments, and macro-economic factors that could influence Bitcoin’s price. Long-Term Perspective: Many view Bitcoin as a long-term investment. Consider a dollar-cost averaging strategy to mitigate the impact of volatility. In conclusion, the consistent and significant inflows into US Spot Bitcoin ETFs , particularly led by powerhouses like BlackRock IBIT and the surprising positive turn for Grayscale GBTC , underscore a powerful narrative: Bitcoin is increasingly being embraced by mainstream finance. This trend not only validates Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class but also opens new avenues for investors to participate in the digital economy with greater ease and confidence. As these ETFs continue to attract capital, they are poised to play an even larger role in shaping the future trajectory of Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market.
