2025-06-25T06:30:00,"Bitfinex Securities Is Taking a Different Approach to RWAs, Launches Two New Products in the U.K.","These days, the mention of blockchain-based real world assets (RWAs) conjures up traditional finance institutions, like BlackRock, presiding over billions of dollars in tokenized money market funds. But the original promise of crypto was about opening up finance opportunities to anyone. That’s the ethos Bitfinex Securities is sticking to with its latest tokenized equity issuances: two alternative finance products in the UK, one focused on community banking debt, the other on litigation relating to mis-sold car finance claims. Announced on Wednesday, Bitfinex Securities’ “ TITAN1 ” product will allocate 5 million british pounds ($6.8 million) into subordinate debt issued by Castle Community Bank, a firm supporting loans to financially excluded customers in Edinburgh, Scotland. This alternative debt product will provide investors with a 20% dividend per annum (net of fees), which will be paid quarterly for up to 10 years, with non-callable provisions for the first 5 years, according to a press release. The second structure, “ TITAN2, ” will invest 100 million british pounds ($136 million) into litigation financing related to car finance mis-selling claims in the UK, a market expected to generate billions in compensation. Funds will be deployed through equity-linked notes and Investors will receive a 50% share of the claims recovery proceeds split proportionately among investors, Bitfinex Securities said. Both listings will be accessible to investors as tradable tokens via Bitfinex Securities’ secondary market. The tokens have been issued on the Liquid Network, a side chain of Bitcoin developed by technology firm Blockstream, where transfers require issuer authorization, with a whitelist system ensuring compliance standards and jurisdictional requirements. Looking back in time, Bitfinex Securities’ foray into tokenized RWAs pre-dates by some years the current trend for blockchain-based financial assets issued by institutions like BlackRock or Franklin Templeton. The firm started out with niche products like a tokenized bitcoin mining hashrate contract linked to Blockstream, followed by a number of bond issuances, including the first tokenized U.S. Treasuries offering in the nascent crypto hub of El Salvador, bringing T-Bill investments to individuals and organizations who were previously unable to access these products. Jesse Knutson, head of operations at Bitfinex Securities, takes a philosophical view of the current tokenization trend. “We want to be able to help people bridge that gap to investors,” Knutson said in an interview. “Whether it's a company or a bond issuance, or whatever it is, to raise capital and kind of fill that gap that's left by banks in many parts of the world that just aren't willing to lend, or where people struggle to get access to capital.” Fresh off a digital assets panel in London alongside BlackRock and UK asset manager Schroders, Knutson said there’s something of a bias in the ecosystem towards fixed income. Most of the focus is around money market funds, where people tend to buy and hold to get a yield, so there's just not a lot of trading, he said. “A big part of this is about disintermediation, and I think that’s something the institutional guys don't quite get,” Knutson said. “When you look at the details of what they've actually done, it's typically left hand to right hand. It's the same kind of people. It's going through depositories, it's going through transfer payment agents, all of the normal kind of parts of the traditional ecosystem, which I don't think are technologically probably necessary.” Read more: How the Next Wave of RWAs is Becoming Crypto’s Real Edge",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/06/25/bitfinex-securities-is-taking-a-different-approach-to-rwas-launches-two-new-products-in-the-u-k,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SPONSORED","Finance|Tokenization|Bitfinex securities|News",cryptocompare

2025-06-25T06:18:18,"Bitcoin's Upcoming $14B Options Expiry Marked by Surge in Put-Call Ratio. What Does it Indicate?","Bitcoin's BTC put-call ratio has jumped ahead of Friday's multi-billion-dollar options expiry on Deribit, but its traditional bearish interpretation may not tell the full story this time. The put-call open interest ratio refers to the ratio of active put contracts to active call contracts at a given time. An increase in the put-call ratio indicates a bias towards put options, offering protection against downside risks, and is interpreted as representing a bearish market sentiment. However, the latest spike is at least partly driven by ""cash-secured puts"" – a yield-generation and BTC accumulation strategy. The strategy involves selling (writing) put options, a move analogous to selling insurance against price drops in return for a small upfront premium. At the same time, the writer keeps enough cash (in stablecoins) on the sidelines to buy BTC as obligated if the prices decline and the buyer decides to exercise the right to sell BTC at the predetermined higher price. The premium collected by writing the put option represents a yield with the potential for BTC accumulation if the put buyer exercises the option. ""The put/call ratio has risen to 0.72 — up from just above 0.5 in 2024— indicating a growing interest in put options, often structured as cash-secured puts,"" Lin Chen, head of business development - Asia at Deribit, told CoinDesk. Options expiry worth $14 billion looming On Friday, at 08:00 UTC, a total of 141,271 BTC options contracts, worth over $14 billion, representing more than 40% of the total open interest will expire on Deribit, according to data source Deribit Metrics. Of the total due for settlement, 81,994 contracts are calls, while the rest are put options. On Deribit, one options contract represents one BTC. Chen said that nearly 20% of expiring calls are ""in-the-money (in profit),"" meaning that a large number of market participants hold calls at strikes that are below BTC's current spot market rate of $106,000. ""This suggests call buyers have performed well this cycle, aligning with the persistent inflows into BTC ETFs,"" Chen noted. Holders of in-the-money (ITM) calls are already profitable and may choose to book profits or hedge their positions as expiry nears, which can add to market volatility. Alternatively, they might roll over (shift) positions to the next expiry. ""As this is a major quarterly expiry, we expect heightened volatility around the event,"" Chen said. Broadly speaking, most of calls are set to expire out-of-the-money or worthless. Notably, the $300 call has the highest open interest, a sign traders likely hoped for an outsized price rally in the first half. The max pain for the expiry is $102,000, a level where option buyers would suffer the most. Focus on $100K-$105K range Latest market flows indicate expectations for back-and-forth trading, with a slight bullish bias as we approach the expiry. According to data tracked by leading crypto market maker Wintermute, the latest flows are skewed neutral, with traders selling straddles —a volatility bearish strategy — and writing calls around $105,000 and shorting puts at $100,000 for the June 27 expiry. ""For #BTC options, flows skew neutral with straddle/call selling around 105K and short puts at 100K (27 Jun), pointing to expectations of tight price action into expiry. Selective call buying (108K–112K, Jul/Sep) adds a capped bullish tilt. IV remains elevated,"" OTC desk at Wintermute, told CoinDesk in an email.

A June 25 announcement, shared by Pompliano on X, outlines a business merger that would form ProCap Financial, Inc., a Nasdaq-listed entity. The move comes after a series of high-profile events for the company, demonstrating its intention to develop institutional infrastructure around Bitcoin ( BTC ). https://twitter.com/apompliano/status/1937655546695549235?s=46&t=nznXkss3debX8JIhNzHmzw Just a day before the filing, ProCap disclosed the purchase of 3,724 BTC, worth approximately $387 million, at an average price of $103,785 per coin. In addition, the company recently raised more than $750 million, which included $225 million in convertible debt and $550 million in equity.

As part of the process, Columbus Circle and ProCap will submit a registration statement to the SEC, including a joint prospectus and proxy materials.

2025-06-25T06:11:38,"Ethereum price Eyes 107% Surge as Golden Cross Pattern Returns","The post Ethereum price Eyes 107% Surge as Golden Cross Pattern Returns appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market turned green after a surprise ceasefire in the Middle East. Along with the ceasefire, a few other big changes took place in global markets, creating a bullish mood for cryptocurrencies, especially altcoins. The recent price drop could have been a bottom for altcoins, and the sharp recovery since then supports this view. Indicators also hint that altcoins could soon outperform Bitcoin. Ethereum and the altcoin market are showing signs of something big brewing. After the recent sharp drop in prices, which felt like a final shakeout for many traders, market charts are starting to look very bullish. Interestingly, just like how oil prices hinted at a ceasefire before it was officially announced, crypto charts too have a habit of predicting major moves before they happen. Ethereum and Golden Cross On Crypto Banter’s Ran Show, the analyst said that Ethereum is about to form a golden cross, a technical signal where the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average. In the past, this pattern has led to huge price jumps for ETH, including rallies of 107%, 25%, and even an incredible 2,500%. What makes it even more exciting is that the entire altcoin market, excluding Bitcoin, is also just days away from forming its own golden cross. Historically, these moments have triggered powerful rallies in the market. With interest rates falling, market sentiment shifting, and technical signals lining up, it looks like Ethereum and altcoins might be getting ready for a strong move upward in the weeks ahead. Ethereum Short-Term Price Targets: Ethereum has seen a short rally in the past 12 hours, but it’s too early to confirm a strong recovery. Important support lies around $2,380, this level must hold to keep hopes alive for a bigger breakout.

2025-06-25T06:00:53,"Bitcoin Deposit Activity Drops To Historic Low As ETFs And Long-Term Holding Gain Ground","As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to hold above the psychologically important $100,000 price level, a “true paradigm shift” is emerging among investors. Notably, exchange deposit activity is declining, signalling growing confidence in BTC as a reliable store of value. Bitcoin Deposit Address Activity Plunges To Historic Lows According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by on-chain contributor Darkfost, there has been a noticeable shift in the number of BTC wallet addresses depositing to exchanges since the 2021 bull cycle. The analyst shared the following chart to support their analysis. It shows a steady increase in the number of addresses depositing BTC on exchanges between 2015 and 2021, peaking at an annual average of approximately 180,000. However, this trend has sharply reversed since then and has shown no signs of recovery. Notably, the 10-year average for the number of addresses depositing BTC to exchanges currently sits around 90,000. Shorter-term metrics reinforce this decline. The 30-day moving average (MA) is hovering around 48,000, while the daily figure has dropped to just 37,000. This drastic behavioral shift among investors can be attributed to two key factors. First, the emergence of BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has redirected a significant portion of demand away from spot exchanges. ETFs allow exposure to Bitcoin’s price performance without the complexity or risk of self-custody. Second, retail participation has been relatively subdued in the current market cycle, naturally reducing the number of active deposit addresses.The analyst noted: More investors, and now even companies, are adopting a long-term vision for BTC, choosing to hold it as savings or treasury reserves rather than actively trading it. Is BTC Preparing For A New High? As the number of addresses depositing BTC to exchanges continues to decline, several indicators point toward the potential for a new all-time high (ATH). Recent analysis by crypto analyst CryptoGoos suggests that short-term sellers are “getting exhausted,” implying that selling pressure may ease soon. Similarly, the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart – a long-term valuation model used to identify overvaluation and undervaluation zones – recently flashed a “buy” signal. Although, the wider market demand remains weak. Macroeconomic conditions are also turning favorable. An increase in the global M2 money supply is expected to benefit risk-on assets like Bitcoin. Some experts now predict BTC could rise as high as $150,000 as liquidity expands. That said, not all signs are bullish. Miner-to-exchange transfers have recently spiked to historic highs, potentially signalling increased selling pressure from BTC miners. At press time, BTC is trading at $105,141, up 2.6% in the past 24 hours.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-deposit-activity-drops-to-historic-low-as-etfs-and-long-term-holding-gain-ground/,"AAVE|ADA|ALGO|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CFX|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin addressess|Bitcoin deposits|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto exchange|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|exchange deposits|on-chain analysis",cryptocompare
2025-06-25T06:00:41,"Top Analyst Charts XRP Price Path to $11","Crypto analyst Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) believes XRP is now approaching a critical turning point after a market-wide correction. In a recent post on X, he shared an $11 target and linked to a YouTube video outlining a strategy that anticipates one final leg down before a significant reversal. He placed strong emphasis on structure, liquidity zones, and volume behavior, suggesting that this could be the final opportunity to accumulate before a sharp rally. XRP traded just over $2 at the time of his analysis, after recovering from a dip below $2 , and he noted the absence of a decisive bottoming structure. According to the analyst, XRP is close to completing a right shoulder in a potential reversal pattern , estimating the ideal level around $1.89. A crash toward $1.85 is possible, with further downside to $1.73 or even as low as $1.55 not entirely ruled out. However, these lower targets are not his base case. Bitcoin and ETH Analysis Support Outlook The broader market context supports this cautious stance. Bitcoin, for instance, bounced from $98,200, but Cryptoinsightuk suggested further downside is likely before a true bottom forms. He expects a price range between $92,000 and $95,000 to act as a more probable reversal zone, citing past RSI behavior and a similarity to previous patterns. As for Ethereum, he sees potential for a dip to around $1,996 before it moves higher. Liquidity is thinning below current levels, which he interpreted as waning long interest, which often precedes a final shakeout before reversal riwa$4,200. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Final Flush or Start of Expansion? The central thesis hinges on what he described as a typical structure: a flush of liquidity, followed by bullish divergence and then aggressive expansion toward $11 . He acknowledged the more conservative calls for $8 but stated he sees an extension beyond that figure, estimating $11 to $12 as the upper limit for this rally phase. He confirmed that he’s been actively accumulating during the drawdown. He reaffirmed his long-term view that this pullback was expected and necessary before the next major move. The projection relies on XRP first completing a final move down by 5% to 10% before surging in what he believes will be the next phase of the cycle. Notably, another analyst recently set an $8 to $13 target for XRP, adding credence to Cryptoinsightuk’s prediction. Cryptoinsightuk highlighted spot buying during XRP’s flush and rising open interest, suggesting one more dip before recovery. He expects alt season to begin if Bitcoin dominance falls and sees XRP pushing toward $11 soon. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Key Takeaways: ProCap BTC purchased 3,724 BTC for $386 million ahead of its planned IPO via SPAC merger. The firm’s Bitcoin holdings are now worth nearly $400 million as BTC prices rise. ProCap aims to accumulate up to $1 billion in BTC, joining a wave of corporate treasury buyers. His firm, ProCap BTC, announced Tuesday that it had acquired 3,724 BTC for $386 million, just days after revealing plans to go public later this year. The purchase was made at a time-weighted average price of $103,785 per Bitcoin. Bitcoin Gains Lift Pompliano’s Investment to Nearly $400M With Bitcoin prices climbing since the buy, Pompliano’s investment now sits just below $400 million in value. The acquisition follows Monday’s announcement that ProCap intends to go public through a merger with Columbus Circle Capital, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), forming a new entity named ProCap Financial. “We believe Bitcoin is the new hurdle rate. If you can’t beat it, you have to buy it,” Pompliano wrote on X, underscoring the firm’s conviction in the asset. We have purchased 3,724 Bitcoin. This purchase happened within one day after announcing a $1 BILLION merger and over $750 million fundraise. The average price was ~ $103,785 per bitcoin. We believe bitcoin is the new hurdle rate.

Backers of the upcoming SPAC deal have already raised over $750 million, $516 million in equity commitments and $235 million via convertible notes. Should ProCap go public today, its BTC position would rank 14th among all publicly listed companies, according to BiTBO data. It would sit just behind Semler Scientific, a medical technology firm that recently entered the Bitcoin treasury space. ProCap joins a growing number of firms moving aggressively into Bitcoin. MicroStrategy extended its lead this week with holdings now totaling 592,345 BTC. Japan’s Metaplanet increased its exposure to 11,111 BTC . Grant Cardone’s real estate group disclosed its first buy, 1,000 BTC, while mineral exploration company Panther Metals laid out a $5.4 million crypto strategy combining traditional mining with digital assets. Also this week, Norway’s Green Minerals AS revealed plans to allocate $1.2 billion toward Bitcoin purchases. VanEck Warns BTC Treasury Strategy May Backfire Just recently, VanEck’s head of digital asset research, Matthew Sigel, raised concerns about the Bitcoin treasury strategies used by certain public companies, suggesting that continued accumulation of BTC could soon harm shareholders more than help. He specifically criticized the use of at-the-market (ATM) share issuance programs, warning that they can become dilutive when stock prices approach the company’s Bitcoin net asset value (NAV). Sigel proposed several measures to prevent value erosion, including pausing ATM programs if a company’s stock trades below 0.95x NAV for over 10 days. He drew comparisons to past failures in the crypto mining sector, where excessive dilution and executive pay led to major shareholder losses. As an example, he cited Semler Scientific, a medical tech firm that entered the BTC space in 2024. Despite acquiring 3,808 BTC, its stock has fallen over 45%, and its mNAV has dropped to 0.82x.

The HB 2324 reserve bill gives the state of Arizona the authority to set up a “Bitcoin and Digital Assets Reserve Fund” using cryptocurrencies obtained through criminal forfeiture. Once signed into law, this bill would become the second state-level measure in Arizona to establish a crypto-based state reserve. 🇺🇸 JUST IN: Arizona passes 'Bitcoin Reserve' bill HB2324. The bill creates a reserve for assets obtained through criminal asset forfeiture. If signed by Governor Hobbs, it will be the state's second second reserve bill passed into law. pic.twitter.com/0OlT01LtZp — Bitcoin Laws (@Bitcoin_Laws) June 25, 2025 HB 2324 was initially voted down in the House during its third reading on May 7. However, the state Senate agreed on Thursday to revive the bill after Republican Senator Jane Shamp, who had voted against it, filed a motion to reconsider. The reconsideration vote in the Senate followed party lines almost entirely, with Republican Jake Hoffman as the lone GOP member opposing the bill. At that time, it passed the Senate in a 16-14 vote. Arizona could also claim abandoned digital assets Under the terms of HB 2324, the first $300,000 in digital assets seized during a criminal forfeiture would go to the Attorney General’s office. Any value beyond that threshold would be divided so that 50 percent continues to the Attorney General, 25 percent moves into the state general fund, and the remaining 25 percent is deposited into the new reserve fund. The bill, sponsored by Republican Senator Jeff Weninger, also broadens Arizona’s forfeiture statutes to cover digital assets. It lays out rules for seizing, storing, and allocating these assets. The state of Arizona could claim digital assets from individuals who are deceased, deported, have fled, have gained immunity, or have abandoned it. Of course, officials will have to prove that there is no known owner, that they made diligent efforts to find one, and that no one else has stepped forward to claim it. Earlier this month, on May 7, Governor Hobbs also signed HB 2749 into law. That measure similarly permits Arizona to retain unclaimed cryptocurrency and form a Bitcoin reserve fund without tapping taxpayer dollars or state funds.

2025-06-25T05:34:20,"Senators Skip Key Crypto Hearing as Political Divides Deepen","The goal of the session was to advance a bipartisan market structure bill, but it ended up highlighting political tensions as there was only one Democrat present. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is reportedly preparing an executive order to prevent banks from debanking crypto firms, after accusations of politically motivated discrimination known as “Operation Chokepoint 2.0.” However, the Federal Reserve announced it will no longer consider “reputational risk” in bank oversight, which was a policy that was criticized for harming crypto companies. Low Turnout at Senate Hearing Raises Doubts A recent US Senate hearing that was intended to explore bipartisan legislative frameworks for digital asset market structure saw very low attendance, with only five of the 11 members of the Senate Banking Committee’s digital assets subcommittee present. The hearing was chaired by Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis, and featured testimony from former regulators and industry leaders, including former CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam, Coinbase legal executive Ryan VanGrack, Multicoin Capital’s Greg Xethalis, and Wharton School’s Sarah Hammer. Lummis pointed to the scheduling of multiple competing committee meetings as a possible reason for the poor turnout but expressed concern about the lack of bipartisan engagement on digital asset legislation. (Source: US Senate Banking Committee ) The hearing focused on the development of a Senate bill, which goal is to establish a clear market structure for digital assets, building on the recent passage of the GENIUS Act, a bipartisan stablecoin bill. Despite the earlier cooperative momentum, Lummis raised questions about the growing partisanship surrounding crypto legislation. She hinted at potential political motivations, and suggested that concerns over certain administration members’ family ties to the crypto industry might be influencing Democratic resistance. Democratic Senator Angela Alsobrooks was the only member from her party present at the hearing, filling in for Ranking Member Ruben Gallego. Alsobrooks supported the GENIUS Act and played a role in advancing it. Meanwhile, Republican Senator Bernie Moreno echoed concerns about why crypto legislation has become such a partisan issue, although no direct references were made to President Donald Trump or specific people in the administration. The Senate’s proposed digital asset market structure legislation complements parallel efforts in the House, where the CLARITY Act was recently moved out of committee and is expected to be put to a floor vote. While several Democrats previously voted alongside Republicans to advance the GENIUS Act, the broader debate over crypto regulation in Congress is still very much colored by political suspicion and questions of transparency. Trump Eyes Action Against Crypto Debanking Despite the rising political tensions, the Trump administration is reportedly considering issuing an executive order to prevent banks from cutting off services to politically disfavored industries, including cryptocurrency firms. According to a report from The Wall Street Journal, the proposed move is in response to concerns that financial institutions have been selectively denying services to crypto and tech entrepreneurs in what critics have labeled “Operation Chokepoint 2.0.” The alleged debanking campaign began under former President Joe Biden’s administration, with at least 30 technology and crypto founders reportedly affected. Major banks like JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo recently met with state officials in Texas and Oklahoma to address allegations of discrimination against industries like firearms manufacturing and fossil fuels. Naturally, the issue attracted a lot of bipartisan attention. In February, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren urged the Trump administration to intervene after saying that no one should be denied banking access based on political views or industry affiliation. The topic gained renewed urgency after the collapse of three crypto-friendly banks—Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate Bank, and Signature Bank—between March 10 and 12, 2023. These closures prompted venture capitalist Nic Carter to characterize the situation as a coordinated attempt to marginalize the crypto industry, dubbing it “Operation Chokepoint 2.0.” Despite a seemingly more supportive stance from the Trump administration, there are still some concerns from within the crypto industry. Caitlin Long , CEO of Custodia Bank, explained that the debanking trend may persist until at least 2026. She pointed out that Trump will not be able to appoint a new Federal Reserve governor until January, which could potentially limit the administration’s influence. Long added that if agencies like the OCC and FDIC roll back their anti-crypto stances but the Fed does not, regulatory uncertainty could continue to hamper the industry. Long’s own bank, Custodia, suffered due to these banking restrictions by losing both time and money. Trump did, however, reaffirmed his plans to end the practice during his comments at the White House Crypto Summit on March 7. Federal Reserve Ends Support for Crypto Debanking Meanwhile, the US Federal Reserve announced a major policy shift by directing its supervisors to stop considering “reputational risk” in the oversight of banks. This is a big win for the cryptocurrency industry, which has long argued that the ambiguous concept of reputational risk was used to justify the debanking of crypto firms under Operation Chokepoint 2.0. In its statement, the Federal Reserve Board said it started reviewing its supervisory materials to remove references to reputational risk and replace them with more specific discussions focused on financial risk. The central bank also plans to train its examiners accordingly and ensure the change is consistently applied across all banks it supervises. Additionally, the Fed is working with other federal banking regulators to promote uniform practices across the regulatory landscape. Despite this move, the Fed clarified that banks are still expected to maintain strong risk management systems and comply with all applicable laws and regulations. The change does not prevent banks from considering reputational risk in their internal risk frameworks; it simply removes the concept from supervisory guidance. The Federal Reserve defined reputational risk as the potential for damage due to negative publicity—accurate or not—that could lead to customer loss, litigation, or revenue decline. The move drew praise from both crypto advocates and banking industry leaders. Senator Cynthia Lummis described the previous reputation risk policy as one that “assassinated American Bitcoin and digital asset businesses,” and called the reversal a win, albeit one that requires more action. Rob Nichols, CEO of the American Bankers Association, also supported the change by saying it would make bank supervision more transparent and grounded in sound financial principles rather than regulatory subjectivity. However, not everyone welcomed the decision. Critics argued that removing reputational risk from oversight could downplay non-financial concerns that affect bank stability, weaken overall supervision, and open the door to potentially riskier practices. This policy shift happened as part of the broader rollback of crypto restrictions by US regulators. In May, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency confirmed that banks under its oversight are allowed to trade crypto and outsource related services. Similarly, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation clarified in March that banks can now engage in crypto-related activities without requiring prior approval.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9695/senators-skip-key-crypto-hearing-as-political-divides-deepen,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

According to Alphractal’s analysis, the stablecoin market has been experiencing significant growth in recent weeks. With a total market value approaching $250 billion, stablecoins currently account for around 7.5% of the global cryptocurrency market, with Tether (USDT) taking the largest share. USDT represents more than 66% of all stablecoins. On the other hand, the total market dominance of Bitcoin and stablecoins reached 73.5%.

While altcoins display stability after rebounding from weekend lows, Arbitrum protocol is in the spotlight after generating $1.42 million in revenue within the last seven days. EntropyAdvisor’s dune dashboard reveals these stats, showing a 23% surge from the previous week. Source: Entropyadvisors The impressive earnings place ARB’s blockchain among the economically viable and active Ethereum L2 ecosystems. This article evaluates how real-world asset (RAW) trends drive Arbitrum’s growth. RAW activity on Arbitrum hits ATHs The network has seen impressive performance over the past week, with its RWA sector hitting new all-time highs above $300 million. RWA protocols bridge decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional finance (TradiFi). They allow individuals to access tokenized versions of real-world assets like bonds, invoices, and real estate on dApps. Economists believe the tokenization sector will be a $16 trillion market by 2030, while others expect tremendous growth to $30 trillion in the next five years. In that context, Arbitrum’s attracting $300 million into this industry demonstrates an increasing appetite among builders and investors to onboard real-world use cases into blockchain systems. Moreover, the milestone confirms Arbitrum’s capability to support low-fee, scalable RWA applications. Furthermore, the impressive RWA adoption reflects magnified investor trust in L2 platforms that offer regulated, yield-bearing, and scalable on-chain financial instruments. The soaring RWA activity possibly fueled on-chain volumes and transaction fees, boosting ARB’s protocol revenue. Ecosystem players propel Arbitrum’s boom Various protocols contributed to Arbitrum’s revenue spike in the past few sessions, highlighting the expanding Arbitrum DeFi landscape. GMX, Ostium Labs, and Gains Network led the charge, earning $550K, $225K, and $120K, respectively. Pendle and Uniswap followed with $85K and $82K. According to Web3 enthusiast Isaac Bassey: These numbers reflect not only strong user activity but also the increasing sophistication of Arbitrum’s ecosystem, which is rapidly evolving with innovative protocols and scaling solutions. The flourishing ecosystem protocols aren’t just facilitating on-chain transactions but also building a revolutionary financial infrastructure. ARB price outlook Arbitrum’s native token exhibited a bullish structure on its daily chart, driven by broad-based recoveries and optimistic ecosystem updates. ARB trades at $0.3149 after touching an intraday high of $0.3334. Chart by Coinmarketcap While bulls fight for short-term control, the alt gas struggled with bearishness lately, down 20% and 60% in the previous month and year. The downside is visible as Arbitrum investors have struggled with losses despite various developers’ efforts to rescue the project from deep slides. However, the prevailing trends suggest impending shifts. As retail and institutional investors join the RWA bandwagon, platforms like Arbitrum stand to enjoy massive benefits. Arbitrum’s status as a scalable Ethereum L2 makes it lucrative for supporting more complex fiscal products, including those linked to off-chain assets. Such a trajectory could make Arbitrum the go-to blockchain for DeFi integration with RWA.

2025-06-25T05:00:38,"Tron’s 374% Profit-Taking Spree Uncovered—Here’s Who Was Behind It","On-chain data shows Tron (TRX) observed a large profit-taking spike earlier in the month. Which type of holder was responsible for the move? Tron SOPR Saw A Huge Spike Earlier In The Month In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, analyst Maartunn has talked about the recent trend in the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) of Tron. The SOPR refers to an on-chain indicator that tells us about whether the TRX investors are moving or selling their coins at a profit or loss. The indicator works by going through the transfer history of each coin being moved to see what price it was last transacted at. Coins that have this cost basis above the current spot price are contributing to loss realization, while those with the opposite setup to profit realization. Related Reading: Crypto Bears Rekt: $359M Gone As Bitcoin, Ethereum Rebound The SOPR takes the ratio between the spent value and cost basis, and sums it up for all coins being sold on the blockchain to find a net situation for the market as a whole. When the value of the indicator is greater than 1, it means the investors are, on average, realizing a profit through their transactions. On the other hand, the metric being under this threshold suggests the dominance of loss realization in the market. Now, here is the chart shared by the quant that shows the trend in the Tron SOPR over the past year: As displayed in the above graph, the Tron SOPR saw a huge spike above the 1 mark earlier in the month, implying investors took part in a significant amount of profit-taking. From the chart, it’s also visible that there were other profit realization spikes during the past year, but the current one stands out for its scale. The latest peak in the metric saw its value go to 4.74, corresponding to a profit margin of 374%. “With TRX priced at $0.268 at the time, the average acquisition price for those coins would have been around $0.0566,” explains Maartunn. Interestingly, Tron hasn’t seen extended periods around this price mark since late 2022, meaning that the tokens would have been held for a good while before being finally transacted this month. Usually, when dormant hands break their silence, it’s likely to be for selling-related purposes. That said, it’s not the only reason they may do so. “The activity could be tied to early investors realizing gains, internal transfers, or reallocation decisions,” notes the analyst. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Zone Could Be Market’s Next True ‘Pivot,’ Says Glassnode In some other news, the USDT supply on the Tron network has reached a new milestone, as institutional DeFi solutions provider Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) has pointed out in an X post.

2025-06-25T05:00:00,"The Future of DAG in Finance? BlockDAG Innovative Model Explained!","Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) chains have gained attention over the last few years for solving major blockchain issues. Kaspa, for example, offers quick confirmations and high throughput. But most DAG networks haven’t moved beyond speed. The real challenge is getting these networks used in DeFi, payments, and global money transfers. BlockDAG (BDAG) steps in to close that gap. It’s using a mix of DAG structure and Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus. Add to that EVM compatibility and a plan focused on real-world finance, and BlockDAG becomes more than just another fast chain. It’s setting up the tools to support real payments, daily transactions, and on-chain financial activity where many others have stopped short. BlockDAG Adds What Other DAG Chains Don’t Kaspa and other DAG networks fix issues like slow block times and limited throughput. But most of them stop at the infrastructure level. They rarely move beyond the protocol layer. That’s why usage remains small despite solid tech. BlockDAG takes a wider approach. It combines DAG speed with missing pieces that other projects skipped: PoW to maintain decentralization and network security EVM support so Ethereum developers can join in A no-code builder for easy dApp creation Tools for DeFi like DEXs, bridges, and oracles This setup isn’t just about building a fast network. It’s about creating a blockchain that can handle real financial traffic. Why BlockDAG Is Building Before Listing BlockDAG’s roadmap focuses on putting financial tools into the Layer 1 core. Starting in Q4 2025, and just two weeks before it hits exchanges, key DeFi components will go live: A built-in DEX Lending and borrowing platforms On-chain indexers and oracles Multi-chain bridge for liquidity between networks These features aren’t planned for the distant future. They’re part of a six-week rollout set to begin right before price discovery starts. While most chains wait until after listing to build, BlockDAG is pushing development ahead of time. Its long-term goal is even more ambitious. BlockDAG aims to become a settlement layer for real-time payments, international transfers, and routing trades on DEXs. It’s the part many fast chains have missed, turning speed into real utility. The Power of Combining PoW Security With DAG Speed BlockDAG combines the secure PoW model from Bitcoin with DAG’s ability to process in parallel. That means it can handle thousands of transactions per second without losing security. This is key for financial tasks. On regular Layer 1 chains, validators bundle transactions to save time, but that adds delays. BlockDAG’s system avoids this by confirming transactions in parallel. PoW ensures trust and prevents manipulation. This setup is ideal for: Crypto payments in stores Quick foreign exchange transfers Small cross-border DeFi transactions Instant trade routing on DEXs These aren’t just ideas on paper. If BlockDAG sticks to its current pace, these use cases could become reality by mid-2026. Daily Growth Continues as $0.0020 Offer Nears Its End BlockDAG has already raised $320.5 million in its presale. So far, 23.2 billion coins have been sold. Over 2 million users have joined the X1 app, which allows mining from their phones. More than 18,173 miners have also been sold. The X30 and X100 miners will ship starting July 7. X10 devices will be shipped from August 15. This isn’t just marketing. This shows how the project is turning funds into working tools. With this much support, BlockDAG can grow its builder base, launch financial layers, and keep high-speed performance. BlockDAG’s pricing approach also draws interest. Batch 29 is set at $0.0276, but there’s a special presale rate of $0.0020 running for a short time. That’s much lower than the confirmed $0.05 launch price, meaning early buyers from Batch 1 have already seen 2,660% gains. The presale, currently offering this limited price of $0.0020, is pulling in new retail buyers daily. It’s set to increase to $0.0030 in just a few hours. What’s Next? Most DAG-based platforms focus on speed. BlockDAG goes beyond that. It’s building an entire system on top of that speed, made for crypto finance. The roadmap is clear. Tools are already working. The financial layer is scheduled to launch right before the coin hits exchanges. That kind of planning is rare. And it’s what makes BlockDAG stand out for anyone looking at real blockchain use. If it stays on track, BlockDAG could do what no other DAG chain has done: turn great tech into tools people use every day. It may even go further than Kaspa, by offering not just speed but real financial applications that work at scale. Because speed helps. But speed with function is what changes everything.

2025-06-25T04:50:59,"Ledger NBA Sponsorship Unlocks New Era for Crypto Adoption","BitcoinWorld Ledger NBA Sponsorship Unlocks New Era for Crypto Adoption The world of cryptocurrency just scored a major slam dunk! In a move that signals a monumental shift towards mainstream acceptance, leading hardware wallet provider Ledger has officially partnered with the iconic NBA team, the San Antonio Spurs. This groundbreaking Ledger NBA sponsorship deal, as reported by Bloomberg, isn’t just about branding; it’s a powerful statement about the evolving landscape where digital assets meet traditional sports. Ledger NBA Sponsorship: A Game-Changing Alliance This alliance between a pioneering crypto hardware wallet company and a storied NBA franchise like the San Antonio Spurs marks a significant milestone. For years, the cryptocurrency space has sought avenues for broader recognition and integration into everyday life. This partnership provides exactly that – a highly visible platform within one of the most popular sports leagues globally. The Spurs, known for their disciplined play and consistent success, now align themselves with a company synonymous with digital asset security, bridging two seemingly disparate worlds. It’s a testament to the growing legitimacy and pervasive influence of the crypto economy. The Power of Crypto Hardware Wallet Security At the heart of this partnership is Ledger, a name synonymous with robust digital asset protection. For those new to the space, a crypto hardware wallet is a physical device that stores your private keys offline, making them virtually immune to online hacks and malware. Ledger’s devices, like the Nano S Plus or Nano X, are designed to give users complete control and ultimate security over their Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital currencies. This partnership highlights the critical importance of secure self-custody in the volatile crypto market. It’s not just about owning crypto; it’s about owning it safely. By associating with a reputable brand like Ledger, the San Antonio Spurs are implicitly endorsing the need for secure crypto practices, a vital message for anyone considering entering the digital asset space. San Antonio Spurs Embrace the Future Why would a traditional sports team like the San Antonio Spurs venture into the crypto space? The answer lies in foresight and engaging with a rapidly expanding demographic. Sports teams are increasingly looking for innovative ways to connect with their fan base and tap into new revenue streams. By partnering with Ledger, the Spurs are signaling their openness to technological advancement and their recognition of the burgeoning crypto community. This move could pave the way for future fan engagement initiatives, such as exclusive NFTs, fan tokens, or even crypto payment options for merchandise and tickets. It positions the Spurs as a forward-thinking organization, appealing to a younger, tech-savvy audience while educating their existing fan base about the digital frontier. Driving Mainstream Crypto Adoption Forward This high-profile sponsorship is a significant catalyst for mainstream crypto adoption . When established entities like NBA teams partner with crypto companies, it lends credibility and reduces the perceived risk for the general public. It moves cryptocurrency from niche online forums to prime-time television and arena billboards. Such partnerships help normalize digital assets, making them less intimidating and more accessible. Increased Visibility: Millions of sports fans will now regularly see Ledger’s brand, sparking curiosity. Enhanced Trust: Association with a reputable sports league can build confidence in crypto brands. Educational Opportunities: These partnerships often come with educational campaigns, demystifying crypto for new users. Future Collaborations: It sets a precedent for other sports leagues and traditional businesses to explore similar ventures. While challenges like regulatory clarity and market volatility persist, every step towards mainstream integration helps solidify crypto’s place in the global economy. What Do Blockchain Partnerships Mean for Fans? Beyond the headlines, what does this specific type of blockchain partnership mean for the average fan? For now, it means increased awareness and potentially future opportunities to interact with their favorite team in new, digitally-enabled ways. Imagine exclusive digital collectibles tied to game moments, or unique fan experiences unlocked by holding specific crypto assets. Here are some actionable insights for fans: Stay Informed: Follow both Ledger and the San Antonio Spurs for announcements regarding any fan-centric crypto initiatives. Explore Hardware Wallets: If you’re considering investing in crypto, research and understand the benefits of a hardware wallet for secure storage. Engage Responsibly: As the crypto space expands into sports, be aware of scams and always verify official announcements. This collaboration isn’t just about a logo on a jersey; it’s about paving the way for a more interactive and digitally integrated fan experience. The Ledger NBA sponsorship deal with the San Antonio Spurs is more than just a marketing coup; it’s a powerful symbol of cryptocurrency’s relentless march into the mainstream. It underscores the growing recognition of digital assets by traditional industries and highlights the critical role of secure infrastructure, like hardware wallets, in this evolving ecosystem. As the lines between the digital and physical worlds continue to blur, expect to see many more such groundbreaking partnerships that not only elevate brands but also accelerate the global understanding and adoption of cryptocurrencies.

VanEck recently filed for the first-ever BNB ETF in the US, including staking rewards. Technical indicators suggest short-term downside risk for BNB, but long-term fundamentals are strengthening rapidly. A new venture led by three former Coral Capital executives, Patrick Horsman, Joshua Kruger, and Jonathan Pasch, is raising $100 million to create a publicly-traded company that will accumulate BNB tokens as its primary treasury reserve asset. The move mirrors the well-known Bitcoin strategy of Michael Saylor’s company, Strategy, and signals growing institutional interest in major Layer 1 tokens beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. The new company, to be named Build & Build Corporation, will be formed through a Nasdaq-listed shell company.

According to a company filing on Wednesday, the funding was secured through the issuance of 54m new shares after EVO Fund exercised a portion of its stock acquisition rights. Metaplanet aims to raise as much as $5.4b through its 555m Plan, with the goal of acquiring 210,000 Bitcoin by the end of 2027, roughly 1% of the total supply. Metaplanet Raises $517.8M in First Tranche of 555 Million Bitcoin Plan As part of this effort, shares were issued at ¥1,388 each, or about $9.59, generating around ¥74.9b, or $517.8m. The issuance accounts for about 10% of the total 555m shares the company plans to release. 10% of the 555 Million Plan executed on Day 1. ¥74.9B ($0.5B+) raised. https://t.co/53bjAT6Egm — Simon Gerovich (@gerovich) June 25, 2025 This initial funding round follows Metaplanet’s recent board approval to commit up to $5b to its US subsidiary. The unit, Metaplanet Treasury Corp, is based in Florida. Going forward, the American arm will manage Bitcoin acquisition and treasury operations. It will also tap into deeper US capital markets and institutional infrastructure to support the company’s global strategy. If Fully Executed, Plan Would Place Metaplanet Among Largest Bitcoin-Holding Firms Metaplanet is following a strategy similar to that of US-based MicroStrategy , which has acquired over 1% of Bitcoin’s total supply through equity raises. Now, Metaplanet aims to replicate that approach from the Asia-Pacific region. It hopes to position itself as a digital asset leader within Japanese capital markets. According to the company, 96% of funds raised will go toward Bitcoin purchases. The remaining amount will be used for bond redemptions and yield-generating strategies. Following Monday’s issuance, Metaplanet’s total outstanding shares climbed to over 654m. If fully executed, the 555m Plan could make Metaplanet one of the world’s largest corporate holders of Bitcoin.

MAGACOIN FINANCE has now emerged as a serious contender during its final pre-sale phase. With Bitcoin and XRP holders shifting strategies and Arbitrum’s rebound catching interest, all eyes are on whether this altcoin becomes the next breakout rotation play . MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Focal Point for Strategic Capital MAGACOIN FINANCE has passed the $10 million fundraising milestone with each phase selling out at an accelerating pace. With a capped supply , a verified HashEx audit , and a community-first, VC-free model , the project is defining scarcity-backed momentum. Its appeal is driven by community support—most participants are accumulating and staking, indicating long-term confidence. Its listing prospects have drawn comparisons to early giants like Solana and Ethereum, positioning it as a rare opportunity before the broader market catches on. XRP: Rotating for Faster Upside XRP’s momentum has cooled slightly in recent weeks, prompting traders to look for newer, faster-moving vehicles. MAGACOIN FINANCE has drawn strong interest from XRP holders searching for greater near-term ROI potential and clearer upside catalysts during this quarter. Bitcoin: Profits Fueling Rotational Plays As Bitcoin consolidates above $105,000 , high-cap traders are reallocating profits into pre-launch opportunities. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out for its tokenomics, grassroots appeal, and timing—making it an attractive target for rotation without departing from strong fundamentals. Arbitrum: Building Back for Long-Term Arbitrum (ARB) has begun to recover following a turbulent spring. While long-term forecasts are optimistic, many investors are looking elsewhere for faster price movement. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s pre-launch format is proving to be a compelling hedge for those seeking action now rather than later.

MAGACOIN FINANCE and SEI are now attracting attention from Solana and Bitcoin investors, while Ethereum’s ecosystem keeps a close eye on their momentum. Analysts are flagging both as strategic accumulation zones in the months ahead. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Top Accumulation Zone of Q3 MAGACOIN FINANCE has positioned itself as one of the most compelling early-stage projects in 2025. With a fully audited structure, capped supply, and no VC control, it combines transparency with disciplined execution. Its presale has generated considerable demand, setting a precedent for community-led, scarcity-driven tokens. Backed by strong staking utility and a committed user base, MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to build momentum as a credible contender in the altcoin landscape. Solana: Institutional Strength and ETF Optimism Solana’s expanding ecosystem and potential ETF approval have amplified institutional interest. Despite its robust fundamentals, many early investors are diversifying into tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE to access untapped, pre-listing opportunities. This shift reflects a broader strategy of capturing asymmetric upside before large-scale adoption. Bitcoin: Market Anchor, Rotating for Upside Bitcoin remains the market’s foundation, but as its growth stabilizes, investors are reallocating toward early-stage opportunities. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a preferred target, combining structure and sentiment in a market eager for the next strong performer. SEI: Under-the-Radar with Strong Signals SEI is quietly evolving, with traction growing across tokenization and decentralized science sectors. While some uncertainties remain, its development pace and recent performance suggest it’s gaining recognition among forward-looking traders. Ethereum: Observing the Shift Ethereum’s community is closely tracking these developments. With smart contract compatibility and historical parallels to its early growth, Ethereum’s ecosystem views MAGACOIN FINANCE and SEI as aligned with the type of high-upside stories that defined its own rise. Conclusion As capital rotates and attention sharpens, MAGACOIN FINANCE and SEI are establishing themselves as key altcoin opportunities heading into Q3. With Solana and Bitcoin traders already engaged and Ethereum observers validating their potential, both assets are set to define the early-stage narrative of 2025.

2025-06-25T03:08:38,"Ethereum Price Targets Upside Break — Will Momentum Carry It Past the Hurdles?","Ethereum price started a fresh increase above the $2,220 zone. ETH is now showing positive signs and might aim for a move above the $2,550 zone. Ethereum started a fresh upward move above the $2,220 level. The price is trading above $2,320 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2,390 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it settles above the $2,500 resistance zone in the near term. Ethereum Price Eyes More Gains Ethereum price started a fresh increase above the $2,200 support level, like Bitcoin . ETH price was able to clear the $2,220 and $2,250 resistance levels to move into a positive zone. The bulls even pushed the price above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,568 swing high to the $2,115 low. However, they are now facing hurdles near the $2,480 and $2,500 levels. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,320 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The price is now just above the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,568 swing high to the $2,115 low. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $2,500 level. The next key resistance is near the $2,550 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,565 level. A clear move above the $2,565 resistance might send the price toward the $2,650 resistance. An upside break above the $2,650 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,720 resistance zone or even $2,800 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,500 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,390 level and the trend line. The first major support sits near the $2,350 zone. A clear move below the $2,350 support might push the price toward the $2,320 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,250 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,150. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.

2025-06-25T03:00:59,"Bitcoin Poised For Rally As Geopolitical Tensions Ease And Inflation Expectations Fall","Leading crypto exchange Binance witnessed a significant outflow of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) on June 23, with investors pulling out over 4,000 BTC and 61,000 ETH in a single day. This shift comes amid easing geopolitical tensions and declining inflation, fuelling speculation about a renewed rally. Bitcoin Likely To Rally As Global Tensions Simmer According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Amr Taha, Bitcoin is likely to resume its upward trajectory, bolstered by a series of recent macroeconomic and geopolitical developments. The analyst highlighted multiple positive signals that could propel the top digital asset closer to its all-time high (ATH). Related Reading: Bitcoin Yearly Trend Suggests Cycle Top Near $205,000 By Year-End, Analyst Says One of the key developments was an announcement by US President Donald Trump, who stated that a ceasefire agreement had been reached between Israel and Iran. This deal removes the immediate threat of Iran closing the Strait of Hormuz, a vital chokepoint for global oil supply. The ceasefire had an immediate and positive effect on global equity markets, with the S&P 500 index surpassing 6,000 for the first time since February 2025. This recovery signals growing investor confidence as geopolitical risks subside. In addition, crude oil prices dropped by 14%, adding to the disinflationary narrative. Lower energy costs help reduce production and transportation expenses, thereby supporting a broader decline in inflationary pressures. Taha concluded: The convergence of significant crypto outflows from Binance, falling oil prices, a bullish breakout in US equities, and the reduction of Middle Eastern tensions presents a striking scenario. With the geopolitical overhang removed, inflation easing, and macro markets stabilizing, Bitcoin is now well-positioned to resume its upward trajectory. Meanwhile, Bitcoin whales – wallets holding large amounts of BTC – appear to be quietly accumulating in anticipation of a breakout. In another CryptoQuant post, contributor Mignolet noted that whale accumulation has been rising steadily since BTC bottomed in April. Mignolet pointed out that whale activity typically increases during periods of low market attention or heightened fear, often foreshadowing bullish reversals. Historical data supports this trend, showing that increased accumulation often precedes significant price surges. Bullish Quarter For BTC In an X post published today, seasoned crypto analyst Titan of Crypto stated that BTC is set to close a bullish monthly candle, reinforcing the long-term uptrend for the flagship cryptocurrency. Several other on-chain and technical indicators also suggest further upside potential. For example, Bitcoin Binary CDD shows that long-term holders are continuing to hold rather than sell, indicating strong conviction in BTC’s long-term value. Related Reading: Bitcoin Forming Inverse Head And Shoulders Pattern – Is $150,000 The Next Target? At the same time, the number of short positions is climbing as BTC consolidates between $100,000 and $110,000. This dynamic raises the probability of a short squeeze, potentially propelling Bitcoin to a new ATH. At press time, BTC trades at $105,408, up 5.2% in the past 24 hours.

2025-06-25T03:00:16,"Can MAGACOIN FINANCE Outperform XRP? Bitcoin and Ethereum Traders Bet Big on Kaspa","In today’s competitive digital asset space, investors are always on the lookout for early-stage opportunities with high-return potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE is now emerging as one of the strongest contenders—often referred to as the best altcoin opportunity currently available. With growing buzz from XRP veterans and shifting capital from Bitcoin and Ethereum communities, attention is also building around Kaspa’s unique blockchain utility. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The New Contender for Explosive Gains MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly gaining recognition for its fundamentals: a permanently capped 170 billion token supply, a full HashEx audit, and a structure built entirely on community ownership. Over $10 million raised and consecutive pre-sale rounds selling out have positioned it as contender for the best crypto to buy in 2025 . Its transparent governance, inflation resistance, and aggressive marketing strategy have led many analysts to draw parallels to past altcoin giants. Many XRP holders are shifting capital here, confident in its asymmetric upside and fast-growing momentum. XRP: Legendary Past, Challenging Present XRP remains a household name due to its historic rallies, but present regulatory overhang and slowed price movement above $2.50 have pushed many long-term holders to explore new, dynamic assets. MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming a popular destination for those rebalancing for sharper upside. Bitcoin & Ethereum: Rotating Capital into Kaspa While Bitcoin trades above $105,000 and Ethereum maintains market dominance, seasoned investors are increasingly rotating into smaller-cap projects. Kaspa has emerged as a favorite due to its unique tech stack, GHOSTDAG protocol, and fast-growing user base. Kaspa: The Technological Standout Kaspa’s architecture enables high throughput, fast confirmations, and wide utility across applications. With rising trading volumes and developer interest, it’s quickly positioning itself as one of the most advanced blockchain platforms in the current cycle. Conclusion As crypto capital rotates and sentiment shifts, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining a foothold among early movers. With strong fundamentals, rising interest, and favorable comparisons to past winners, it stands out as a compelling candidate to outperform XRP. Meanwhile, Kaspa’s technological strength makes it a serious contender for broader adoption.

2025-06-25T02:30:15,"Is MAGACOIN FINANCE Set to Become the Next Ethereum? XRP and Bitcoin Traders Eyeing Solana","With market cycles evolving, investors are watching closely for projects capable of matching Ethereum’s early success. MAGACOIN FINANCE is fast emerging as a prime candidate, catching the attention of seasoned XRP, Bitcoin, and Solana traders looking to enter a scalable, early-stage opportunity before the listing window closes. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Poised for Ethereum-Level Breakout MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining momentum on the strength of fundamentals—scarcity, decentralization, and transparency. With a capped 170 billion token supply, full audit, and no VC control, the project appeals to both retail and institutional investors. Analysts highlight its breakout potential, estimating returns between 75x and 100x, projecting it as the best crypto since the early runs of XRP and Bitcoin (BTC). XRP and Bitcoin: Strategic Rotations in Play XRP remains a dominant force in payments, but as legal uncertainties stall price progress, many of its holders are seeking higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities. MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly the destination for that capital. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s price hovers above $105,000 with stability, but its slower upside has driven many early BTC adopters to rotate partial profits into promising low-cap assets—MAGACOIN FINANCE among the top of that list. Solana: Mature Growth, New Opportunity Needed Solana’s price strength and network improvements continue, but as momentum normalizes, many SOL traders are pivoting to smaller projects with asymmetric upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s surge in community interest and credibility has positioned it as a leading beneficiary. Conclusion From XRP to Solana holders, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly becoming the standout altcoin of 2025. As listing approaches, the time for early action is now. Momentum continues to build as analysts forecast exponential upside. Early buyers are positioning before the wider market catches on.
