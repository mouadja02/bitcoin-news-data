2025-06-25T16:56:49,"Canary Capital CEO Predicts When XRP Price Will Double","In a market still dominated by Bitcoin headlines, some institutional voices are beginning to direct attention elsewhere. Steve McClurg, CEO of Canary Capital, recently offered an optimistic outlook for several major altcoins, signaling a shift in how some firms are approaching the current cycle. The interview gained widespread attention and was shared by prominent crypto influencer Amelie (@_Crypto_Barbie), who posted a clip of McClurg naming XRP as one of the assets that could outperform Bitcoin in 2025. Her post helped spotlight McClurg‚Äôs remarks and added momentum to the conversation around XRP‚Äôs potential. More Than a 10% Upside During the discussion, McClurg pushed back on the idea of modest gains for leading altcoins. When asked whether a 10% upside was a fair expectation, he stated, ‚ÄúI think most of these will double this year.‚Äù XRP was the first token he mentioned among those expected to outperform Bitcoin, alongside SUI, Solana, HBAR, and Litecoin. McClurg described Canary Capital‚Äôs outlook as ‚Äúvery constructive‚Äù on cryptocurrencies with large market caps, and he highlighted some assets he believes will perform spectacularly. WOW! STEVEN MCCLURG, CEO OF CANARY CAPITAL, SAYS: ‚ÄûTHERE‚ÄôS A FEW THAT WE BELIEVE WILL OUTPERFORM BITCOIN THIS YEAR, SUCH AS XRP!‚Äú #XRP WILL CONQUER THE CRYPTO MARKET! pic.twitter.com/6ZDMG2z2wE ‚Äî ùìêùì∂ùìÆùìµùì≤ùìÆ (@_Crypto_Barbie) June 23, 2025 More Lucrative Investments than Bitcoin While maintaining confidence in Bitcoin, McClurg positioned it more as a defensive asset in the current environment. He compared it to the Dow, saying it‚Äôs where investors might move ‚Äúif you want to stay in crypto but have a flight to safety.‚Äù In contrast, he pointed to other large-cap assets as better positioned for upside in a bull market. Canary Capital has consistently shown interest in XRP and was among the first companies to apply for a spot ETF in 2024. XRP‚Äôs Strength in a Changing Market McClurg‚Äôs comments arrive as XRP continues to benefit from improving regulatory clarity and renewed institutional interest . Its unique positioning in global payments infrastructure, along with increasing adoption, supports the view that it could capitalize on current market momentum. Being named first in McClurg‚Äôs list subtly highlights how experienced investors seriously consider XRP. Experts believe a massive breakout is coming , and veteran investors like McClurg can see the asset‚Äôs potential. Even some in the Bitcoin community believe XRP will make a massive move this year. Bitcoin maximalists, such as Davinci Jeremie, have predicted that XRP can hit $24 in 2025 . For investors following informed signals, XRP now stands firmly in the conversation about which assets could lead the next phase of market growth.

The U.S. Department of Justice says Leo Joseph Govoni, 67, of Clearwater, Florida, co-founded the Center for Special Needs Trust Administration (CSNT) around the year 2000, and CSNT employed John Leo Witeck, 60, of Tampa, Florida, as an accountant. The nonprofit managed court awards, settlements and other payments for people with disabilities and special needs. By 2024, CSNT managed over 2,100 special needs trusts containing approximately $200 million, with beneficiaries in almost every state, according to the indictment. However, the DOJ alleges that Govoni, Witeck and their unnamed co-conspirators purloined CSNT client-beneficiary funds and concealed their embezzlement through complex financial transactions. They allegedly sent fraudulent account statements with false balances to their disabled clients. Govoni allegedly used the embezzled cash to buy real estate, fund a brewery and pay personal debts. He also liked to travel by private jet, according to the DOJ. Both men were charged with conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud, wire fraud, mail fraud and money laundering conspiracy, and Govoni was also hit with additional charges of bank fraud, illegal monetary transactions and false bankruptcy declarations.

2025-06-25T16:50:20,"Barclays Crypto Block: Crucial Impact on UK Digital Asset Transactions","BitcoinWorld Barclays Crypto Block: Crucial Impact on UK Digital Asset Transactions A significant development is shaking up the UK cryptocurrency landscape, directly impacting how many users acquire digital assets. Starting June 27, UK investment bank Barclays will no longer permit its customers to use their bank cards for any cryptocurrency-related transactions. This move, as reported by Cointelegraph on X, marks a pivotal moment for those accustomed to direct Barclays crypto block and card-based purchases of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital currencies. If you‚Äôre a Barclays customer, this crucial change demands your immediate attention and understanding. Understanding the Barclays Crypto Block: What You Need to Know The news of Barclays‚Äô decision to implement a comprehensive cryptocurrency card ban has sent ripples through the UK crypto community. Previously, many users found it convenient to use their Barclays debit or credit cards to fund accounts on cryptocurrency exchanges or directly purchase digital assets. This impending restriction means that as of June 27, any attempt to use a Barclays card for such transactions will be declined. It‚Äôs a clear signal from one of the UK‚Äôs major financial institutions regarding its stance on direct card-based crypto interactions. This isn‚Äôt an isolated incident. Several traditional banks globally, and indeed within the UK, have either imposed similar restrictions or increased scrutiny on crypto-related transactions. Their stated reasons often revolve around: Fraud Prevention: Banks cite concerns over the irreversible nature of cryptocurrency transactions, making them a target for fraudsters who might trick individuals into sending funds to illicit crypto addresses. Consumer Protection: The volatility of cryptocurrencies and the lack of robust regulatory frameworks in some areas lead banks to believe they are protecting customers from potential financial losses. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) & Know Your Customer (KYC) Compliance: While reputable exchanges have strong AML/KYC protocols, banks often express concerns about the broader ecosystem and the potential for funds to be laundered through less regulated channels. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies means banks often err on the side of caution until clearer guidelines are established. For individuals engaging in crypto transactions UK -wide, understanding these underlying reasons is crucial, as they often dictate the broader banking industry‚Äôs approach to digital assets. Why Are Banks Limiting Digital Asset Purchases? The decision by Barclays bank crypto restrictions is part of a larger trend observed across the financial sector. While the immediate impact is on the convenience of card-based transactions, the deeper reasons are multifaceted. Banks operate under strict regulatory obligations, especially concerning financial crime and consumer protection. The pseudo-anonymous nature of some cryptocurrency transactions, coupled with the rapid innovation in the DeFi space, presents challenges for traditional financial institutions trying to maintain compliance. Consider the following aspects contributing to banks‚Äô cautious approach: Factor Impact on Banks‚Äô Stance Fraud Risk High incidence of scams involving crypto, leading to chargeback disputes and reputational damage for banks. Market Volatility Rapid price swings in cryptocurrencies can lead to significant losses for consumers, prompting banks to act as gatekeepers. Regulatory Gaps Lack of clear, comprehensive global or even national regulations on crypto assets puts banks in a difficult position regarding compliance. Money Laundering Concerns Fear of illicit funds being moved through crypto, necessitating stringent AML/KYC checks, which are easier to control with direct bank transfers than card payments. Consumer Education Many consumers may not fully understand the risks associated with crypto, leading banks to take a protective stance. This cautious approach is not unique to Barclays. Other prominent UK banks like NatWest and Santander have previously implemented similar limits or outright bans on certain types of crypto transactions, especially those involving debit and credit cards, highlighting a collective concern within the traditional financial system about the perceived risks associated with digital asset purchases . Navigating the New Landscape: Alternatives for UK Crypto Users For Barclays customers and indeed any UK crypto enthusiast, the cryptocurrency card ban doesn‚Äôt mean the end of your crypto journey. It simply means adapting your methods for acquiring digital assets. The good news is that several viable alternatives exist, ensuring you can continue to participate in the crypto economy. Here are some actionable insights and alternatives to consider: Direct Bank Transfers (Faster Payments): Most reputable cryptocurrency exchanges in the UK support direct bank transfers via the Faster Payments service. This method typically allows you to deposit GBP from your bank account directly to the exchange, which you can then use to buy crypto. This is often the preferred method for larger sums and is generally free or incurs minimal fees. P2P (Peer-to-Peer) Platforms: Platforms like LocalBitcoins or Paxful allow you to buy crypto directly from other individuals. Payment methods can vary widely, including bank transfers, PayPal, or even cash. While offering flexibility, always exercise caution and use platforms with robust escrow services to protect yourself. Crypto-Friendly Neobanks/Fintechs: Some newer financial technology companies (neobanks) are more open to cryptocurrency transactions. While not a direct substitute for Barclays, opening an account with such a provider might offer more flexibility for your crypto activities. Always research their policies and regulatory compliance. Alternative Payment Gateways: Some exchanges might offer alternative payment gateways that don‚Äôt involve direct card use but might route through other financial services. Check the specific options available on your preferred exchange. Understanding Exchange Policies: Each exchange has its own set of deposit and withdrawal methods. Before attempting to make digital asset purchases , thoroughly review the supported payment options and any associated fees or limits. This shift requires a bit more planning but ultimately encourages users to explore more robust and often more secure methods of funding their crypto endeavors. The broader implications for crypto transactions UK -wide are that reliance on traditional banking cards for quick crypto buys may diminish, pushing users towards more direct banking integrations or alternative financial rails. The Broader Impact: What Does the Barclays Bank Crypto Decision Mean for the UK? The Barclays crypto block isn‚Äôt just about one bank; it reflects a broader narrative playing out between traditional finance and the burgeoning crypto industry. While some might view it as a setback, others see it as a catalyst for greater innovation in how fiat and crypto interact. Challenges: Reduced Convenience: For new users, card payments were often the easiest entry point. This ban could make initial digital asset purchases seem more daunting. Potential for ‚ÄúDe-banking‚Äù: While not a full de-banking, this move contributes to a narrative where traditional banks are increasingly cautious or restrictive towards crypto businesses and individuals, potentially pushing some activities underground or to less regulated channels. Stifled Innovation (Short Term): If other major banks follow suit without clear regulatory guidance, it could temporarily hinder the growth of seamless fiat-to-crypto on-ramps in the UK. Opportunities: Growth of Direct Bank Integrations: Exchanges will likely double down on optimizing direct bank transfer services, making them faster and more user-friendly. Demand for Crypto-Native Solutions: This could accelerate the development and adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions and stablecoins, reducing reliance on traditional banking rails for crypto activity. Call for Regulatory Clarity: Such moves often highlight the urgent need for comprehensive and clear regulatory frameworks for crypto assets, which could ultimately foster a more stable and integrated environment. The landscape for crypto transactions UK is constantly evolving. As financial institutions grapple with the complexities of digital assets, their decisions shape the accessibility and future growth of the crypto market. The Barclays bank crypto decision serves as a powerful reminder that users must remain adaptable and informed about the changing financial ecosystem. Preparing for June 27: Your Action Plan for Cryptocurrency Card Ban With June 27 fast approaching, it‚Äôs essential for Barclays customers, and indeed anyone involved in digital asset purchases in the UK, to prepare. Don‚Äôt wait until the last minute to find out your preferred method of buying crypto is no longer available. Here‚Äôs a simple action plan: Verify Your Current Methods: If you use a Barclays card for crypto, confirm that you have alternative deposit methods set up on your chosen exchange. Test Bank Transfers: Before June 27, try making a small direct bank transfer to your crypto exchange account to ensure it works smoothly and you understand the process. Explore Other Banks: While Barclays has made its move, other banks might have different policies. However, be aware that the trend is towards increased caution. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on news from your bank and your preferred crypto exchanges regarding deposit methods and regulatory changes. Understand Fees and Limits: Different deposit methods may have varying fees and limits. Familiarize yourself with these to avoid surprises. This proactive approach will help you seamlessly transition your crypto transactions UK activity without interruption. The goal is to ensure that the cryptocurrency card ban by Barclays does not derail your participation in the digital asset space. Conclusion: Adapting to the Evolving UK Crypto Landscape The decision by Barclays to block card-based digital asset purchases from June 27 marks a significant shift for UK crypto users. While it undoubtedly impacts the convenience of acquiring cryptocurrencies via traditional bank cards, it also serves as a crucial reminder of the ongoing tension and evolution between legacy financial systems and the innovative world of digital assets. The Barclays crypto block underscores the need for users to be adaptable, explore alternative funding methods like direct bank transfers, and stay informed about the ever-changing regulatory and banking landscape concerning crypto transactions UK . As the crypto ecosystem matures, navigating these changes with foresight and flexibility will be key to continued participation and success.

2025-06-25T16:34:20,"GameStop sticks to MicroStrategy‚Äôs crypto playbook","GameStop has raised another $450 million through a follow-on sale of zero-coupon convertible senior notes, pushing its total fundraising to $2.7 billion in just under two weeks. The company made the disclosure in a filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday. This second chunk was brought in after the initial $2.25 billion raised last month through a private placement. The notes were offered under a 13-day option that gave the original buyer the right to purchase more, and that option got exercised in full. The notes are due in 2032 and can be converted into GameStop Class A shares at a rate of $28.91 per share, which is a 32.5% premium compared to the stock‚Äôs volume-weighted average price as of June 12‚Äîthe day the first offering launched. GameStop says the money is going into general business use and ‚Äúmaking investments in a manner consistent with GameStop‚Äôs Investment Policy,‚Äù which includes buying Bitcoin to hold on the company‚Äôs balance sheet. GameStop sticks to MicroStrategy‚Äôs crypto playbook GameStop started buying Bitcoin in May, picking up 4,710 coins with part of the proceeds from a $1.3 billion convertible note it sold earlier this year. That first round of buying cost around $500 million. The company is now copying the same strategy that Michael Saylor‚Äôs company, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), used to build up its massive crypto holdings. Strategy became the biggest corporate owner of Bitcoin by selling equity and issuing debt to keep loading up. That tactic also brought heavy price swings to its stock over the past few years. Strategy used different types of securities, including convertible debt, to buy Bitcoin. GameStop is now using the same approach. CEO Ryan Cohen told shareholders the move to stack Bitcoin is about macroeconomic risks, and called the asset‚Äôs fixed supply and decentralized structure a possible hedge against those risks. Ryan is also close friends with Saylor now, as per their X accounts. Shares of GameStop were priced at $23.16 as of Tuesday, down 0.56% on the day, continuing to underperform as market focus shifts toward companies with cleaner financials and stronger growth outlooks. The decision to buy Bitcoin hasn‚Äôt done much to lift the share price, and now analysts are questioning whether the strategy actually makes sense. Revenue down, collectibles up, analysts unimpressed On the same day the company filed details of the second note sale, it also reported a 17% drop in revenue for the fiscal first quarter, down to $732.4 million. Demand for digital games is rising while foot traffic in physical stores continues to slide. GameStop‚Äôs core business, retail sales of new and used games and consoles, is still bleeding out slowly. Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter wasn‚Äôt impressed. He reiterated his underperform rating on GameStop, saying the company is just appealing to ‚Äúgreater fools‚Äù who are willing to pay more than double the value of the company‚Äôs assets. Pachter added that GameStop is already trading at 2.4 times cash, and sees no upside from using that cash to buy Bitcoin. ‚ÄúThe strategy makes little sense,‚Äù he said. That‚Äôs not exactly glowing support from Wall Street. Still, Cohen is pushing the company in new directions. At the annual meeting on Thursday, he said GameStop is expanding its collectibles business, calling trading cards a ‚Äúnatural extension‚Äù of the brand. He described it as a segment with high margins and said it‚Äôs deeply rooted in retail. While games may be going digital, cardboard isn‚Äôt. GameStop said its collectibles revenue jumped 54% in the first quarter compared to last year. Most of that growth came from sales of Pok√©mon Trading Cards, which are clearly still pulling weight among buyers who aren‚Äôt just kids. A survey from Circana showed that 19% of adults had bought Pok√©mon cards for themselves within the last six months. Most buyers said they‚Äôre collecting them for fun or as room decoration. Circana also noted that adults were the biggest spenders across all age groups when it came to toys in the first quarter. So GameStop is stacking Bitcoin and Pok√©mon cards. Whether that works out remains to be seen. But for now, the company has $2.7 billion in its pocket, Bitcoin on its balance sheet, and a CEO betting on collectibles and crypto in equal measure.

That‚Äôs according to a new proposal floated by core developer Barnab√© Monnot to reduce the network‚Äôs slot time from 12 seconds to six seconds, effectively doubling the number of blocks produced per minute. The idea, part of EIP-7782 , could be included in the upcoming Glamsterdam upgrade slated for 2026. Proposals or publicly discussed ideas are commonplace in the blockchain world, and may not necessarily move to testing. If implemented, the proposal would reduce time spent across three key consensus steps: block proposals (3 seconds), attestations (1.5 seconds), and aggregation (1.5 seconds). That would shave six seconds off the current 12-second cycle. Faster blocks mean quicker confirmations, fresher on-chain data for wallets and apps, and a more seamless experience for users. ‚Äî Shaurya Malwa Read more .

2025-06-25T16:30:14,"Bitcoin ETFs Unveiling Crucial Market Impact Over Treasury Holdings","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin ETFs Unveiling Crucial Market Impact Over Treasury Holdings Are you an investor trying to decipher the true drivers behind Bitcoin‚Äôs market movements? In the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrency, understanding the forces that shape Bitcoin‚Äôs price and adoption is paramount. For years, we‚Äôve watched as major corporations added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, hailing it as a new era of institutional adoption. But what if their actual market impact is less significant than you might think? Unveiling the True Drivers: Bitcoin ETFs vs. BTC Treasury Companies Recent insights from K33 Research challenge a common perception, suggesting that despite the growing trend of BTC treasury companies, their influence on the market pales in comparison to that of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). Vetle Lunde, a prominent analyst at K33 Research, highlighted this crucial distinction, as reported by The Block, sparking an important conversation among crypto enthusiasts and investors alike. It‚Äôs a nuanced point, but one with significant implications for how we perceive institutional engagement with Bitcoin. While both represent forms of corporate or institutional exposure to Bitcoin, their operational mechanics lead to vastly different levels of direct market demand and, consequently, price correlation. Why Do Bitcoin ETFs Have More Punch? The core of Lunde‚Äôs argument lies in the fundamental difference in how these entities acquire and manage their Bitcoin holdings. Let‚Äôs break down the mechanics: Cash Creation vs. In-Kind Swaps: The vast majority of spot Bitcoin ETFs, particularly those launched in the US, operate on a cash creation model. This means that when investors buy shares of a Bitcoin ETF, the fund manager receives cash, which is then directly used to purchase Bitcoin from the open market. This process generates fresh, direct demand for Bitcoin, immediately impacting its supply-demand dynamics. Treasury Companies and In-Kind: In contrast, many BTC treasury companies, especially those that accumulate Bitcoin through strategic acquisitions or corporate actions, often utilize ‚Äòin-kind‚Äô share swaps. This means they might issue new shares of their own company in exchange for Bitcoin, or acquire Bitcoin directly from a counterparty without necessarily creating new, incremental demand on the open market. The Bitcoin they acquire might already be in circulation, simply changing hands from one large holder to another, rather than being bought fresh from the market. Correlation with Price Returns: This distinction is vital. Lunde points out that Bitcoin ETFs show a strong, direct correlation with Bitcoin price returns. When ETF inflows are high, it often signals significant buying pressure, which tends to push the price up. For treasury companies, while their accumulation is a bullish long-term signal, the immediate correlation between their flows and Bitcoin prices is significantly weaker due to the nature of their acquisitions. Consider this simplified comparison: Feature Bitcoin ETFs (Spot) BTC Treasury Companies Primary Acquisition Method Cash Creation (funds buy BTC directly) In-Kind Swaps, Direct OTC Purchases, Corporate Acquisitions Market Demand Generation High (new money directly into BTC) Low (often existing BTC changing hands) Correlation with BTC Price Strong & Immediate Weaker & Delayed Accessibility for Investors High (traditional brokerage accounts) Indirect (via company stock) The Dilution Effect: Why Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Isn‚Äôt Always Equal While the number of treasury initiatives continues to grow, Lunde highlights that their market influence has been diluted. This means that as more companies hold Bitcoin, the impact of any single company‚Äôs acquisition becomes less pronounced on the overall market. Imagine a large pool of water: dropping a single stone into it creates ripples. But if you drop many small stones simultaneously, the individual ripples become less distinct, and the overall disturbance is diffused. This ‚Äòdilution effect‚Äô is why we observe weaker correlations between treasury flows and Bitcoin prices. The market absorbs these acquisitions more smoothly without the dramatic price swings often associated with significant ETF inflows. What Does This Mean for Your Investment Strategy? Understanding this distinction is an actionable insight for any serious institutional Bitcoin investor or enthusiast: Focus on ETF Flows: If you‚Äôre tracking short-to-medium term price movements, monitoring Bitcoin ETF inflows and outflows provides a more direct indicator of immediate buying or selling pressure. Significant net inflows often precede or coincide with positive price action, reflecting fresh capital entering the ecosystem. Treasury Holdings as Long-Term Signals: While treasury holdings might not move the needle daily, they are incredibly important for the long-term narrative of Bitcoin adoption. They signify corporate conviction, balance sheet diversification, and a growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Think of them as foundational strength rather than dynamic market drivers. Not All Institutional Adoption is Equal: This research underscores that not all forms of institutional Bitcoin adoption have the same market crypto market impact. While both are positive, their mechanisms of interaction with the open market differ significantly. The rise of Bitcoin ETFs has truly democratized access to Bitcoin for traditional investors, bridging the gap between conventional finance and the digital asset world. This ease of access, combined with the cash-creation mechanism, makes them powerful catalysts for price discovery and liquidity. Looking Ahead: The Evolving Bitcoin Landscape As the Bitcoin ecosystem matures, we can expect continued evolution in how institutions engage with the asset. While treasury companies will likely continue to accumulate Bitcoin as a strategic reserve, the spotlight for immediate market impact appears firmly fixed on Bitcoin ETFs. Their ability to attract vast amounts of capital and directly translate that into open market Bitcoin purchases makes them an undeniable force. This K33 research serves as a vital reminder to look beyond headlines and delve into the underlying mechanics of institutional adoption. It‚Äôs not just about who holds Bitcoin, but how they acquire it, and what that means for the broader market.

A potential ceasefire has pushed momentum bullish for the first time since May, with the MACD line surpassing the signal line in a golden cross as an early indication of a trend reversal. Momentum has flipped bullish for the first time in weeks, with the MACD line crossing above the signal line in a golden cross‚Äîan early sign of a potential trend reversal. The RSI has also bounced from oversold territory at 30, signalling seller exhaustion. However, it has since plateaued at 36 following news that the ceasefire has been broken. This bullish momentum coincides with a critical bounce from the wedge‚Äôs lower support, aligned with a historic accumulation zone near the $9.30 level‚Äîthe 0.236 Fibonacci retracement. This zone intersects with the pattern‚Äôs upper resistance trendline, forming a confluence zone for a potential breakout.

Bitcoin Season Just Got a Whole Lot More Bullish Those who jumped to more speculative plays like TRUMP coin over the leading crypto may be forced to reconsider as the Bitcoin ecosystem finally addresses its biggest limitation: scalability.

2025-06-25T16:20:10,"Bitcoin Price Soars: BTC Rises Above $107,000 in a Powerful Rally","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Soars: BTC Rises Above $107,000 in a Powerful Rally The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with exhilarating news: Bitcoin Price has achieved a remarkable milestone, soaring above the $107,000 mark! According to real-time market monitoring, this pivotal move signifies a renewed vigor in the digital asset space, capturing the attention of both seasoned investors and curious newcomers. As of the latest updates, BTC is actively trading at $107,000 on the Binance USDT market, a clear indicator of strong buying pressure and robust market sentiment. This significant leap not only reflects Bitcoin‚Äôs enduring appeal but also sets a compelling tone for the broader crypto market. Understanding the Latest Bitcoin Price Action Bitcoin‚Äôs journey to $107,000 is more than just a number; it‚Äôs a testament to its resilience and growing acceptance. This latest price surge follows a period of consolidation, where the market was carefully weighing various macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments. The breakthrough above key resistance levels suggests a fundamental shift in momentum, potentially paving the way for further upward movement. For many, this marks a critical point, reinforcing Bitcoin‚Äôs narrative as a premier digital asset. Key aspects of this price action include: Significant Volume: The rally is often accompanied by increased trading volume, indicating genuine buying interest rather than a mere speculative pump. Market Sentiment Shift: A break above a psychological barrier like $107,000 often triggers a wave of positive sentiment, encouraging more investors to enter or increase their positions. Technical Indicators: Various technical analysis tools, such as moving averages and RSI, often turn bullish following such a decisive move, attracting technically-minded traders. What‚Äôs Fueling This BTC Surge ? The recent BTC surge above $107,000 is not an isolated event but rather the culmination of several influential factors converging to create a powerful upward trajectory. Understanding these drivers is crucial for anyone looking to comprehend the dynamics of the current market. Several catalysts are believed to be contributing to Bitcoin‚Äôs impressive performance: Institutional Adoption: A continuous influx of institutional capital, including investments from major corporations, asset managers, and sovereign wealth funds, provides a strong foundation for Bitcoin‚Äôs value. These large-scale investments lend legitimacy and stability to the market. Macroeconomic Climate: Global economic uncertainties, inflation concerns, and a search for alternative stores of value often push investors towards decentralized assets like Bitcoin. Its limited supply makes it an attractive hedge against traditional currency debasement. Halving Event Impact: While not immediate, the long-term effects of Bitcoin‚Äôs halving events, which reduce the supply of new Bitcoin, continue to underpin its scarcity model and future price appreciation. Technological Advancements: Ongoing developments within the Bitcoin ecosystem, such as improvements in scalability, security, and integration with traditional finance, enhance its utility and appeal. Retail Investor Re-engagement: As positive news spreads, retail investors, who have always been a significant force in the crypto market, are likely re-entering or increasing their participation, adding to the buying pressure. These factors collectively create a robust environment for Bitcoin‚Äôs growth, pushing its valuation to new heights and solidifying its position in the global financial landscape. Navigating the Volatile Crypto Market While the excitement around Bitcoin‚Äôs ascent is palpable, it‚Äôs imperative for investors to approach the crypto market with a balanced perspective. Volatility is an inherent characteristic of digital assets, and rapid price movements, both up and down, are common. Understanding this dynamic is key to making informed decisions and managing risk effectively. Here are some considerations for navigating this dynamic environment: Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Diversifying your portfolio and setting clear entry and exit strategies can help mitigate potential losses. Market Research: Stay informed about market trends, news, and expert analyses. Knowledge is your best defense against impulsive decisions. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Decide whether you are investing for short-term gains or long-term growth. Different strategies apply to each approach. Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term trend has historically been upward, despite short-term fluctuations. Emotional Discipline: The crypto market can be a rollercoaster of emotions. Avoid making decisions based on fear of missing out (FOMO) or panic selling. The current surge presents both exciting opportunities and potential pitfalls. A cautious yet optimistic approach is often the most prudent path. Is Digital Gold Reclaiming Its Throne? Bitcoin has long been dubbed ‚Äò Digital Gold ‚Äò due to its scarcity, decentralization, and perceived ability to act as a store of value, much like its physical counterpart. The recent price action, particularly the break above $107,000, strongly suggests that this narrative is gaining significant traction once again. In times of economic uncertainty and inflation, investors often seek safe-haven assets, and Bitcoin‚Äôs characteristics make it an increasingly attractive option. Comparisons with traditional gold highlight Bitcoin‚Äôs unique advantages: Feature Bitcoin Gold Scarcity Fixed supply of 21 million Finite, but new discoveries possible Portability Easily transferable globally Requires physical transport/secure storage Divisibility Highly divisible (Satoshis) Less practical for small transactions Decentralization No central authority Subject to central bank policies/mining companies This resurgence in Bitcoin‚Äôs value reaffirms its position as a compelling alternative asset, potentially outperforming traditional hedges in the long run. Seizing the Investment Opportunity : What Next? For many, the current market conditions represent a significant investment opportunity . However, seizing this moment requires careful consideration and a strategic approach. It‚Äôs not just about buying when prices are rising, but about understanding the broader market landscape and aligning your actions with your financial goals. Actionable insights for potential investors: Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of investing a lump sum, consider investing a fixed amount regularly. This strategy helps mitigate risk from market volatility and averages out your purchase price over time. Due Diligence: Thoroughly research any investment. Understand Bitcoin‚Äôs technology, its use cases, and the factors that influence its price. Security First: Prioritize the security of your assets. Use reputable exchanges, strong passwords, and consider hardware wallets for larger holdings. Stay Updated: The crypto space evolves rapidly. Follow reliable news sources, market analysts, and community discussions to stay ahead. Consult a Financial Advisor: For significant investments, seeking advice from a qualified financial advisor who understands digital assets can provide personalized guidance. While the allure of quick gains is strong, a disciplined and informed approach will yield more sustainable results in the long run. The current rally could be a precursor to even greater heights, but preparedness is paramount. Conclusion: A New Horizon for Bitcoin Bitcoin‚Äôs powerful surge past $107,000 is more than just a fleeting moment; it‚Äôs a profound indicator of its strengthening position in the global financial ecosystem. This milestone underscores Bitcoin‚Äôs enduring appeal as a store of value, a hedge against traditional economic pressures, and a leading innovator in decentralized finance. While the crypto market remains dynamic and subject to fluctuations, the consistent upward trajectory of Bitcoin, driven by increasing institutional adoption and renewed retail interest, paints a compelling picture for its future. As the world continues to embrace digital transformation, Bitcoin stands at the forefront, potentially leading a new era of financial freedom and opportunity. This is not just a price point; it‚Äôs a statement about the future of money.

This is the first step in a much larger plan to raise a total of $5.4 billion. The company wants to use all the money to increase its Bitcoin holdings, aiming to become one of the largest corporate holders of the cryptocurrency in the world. Metaplanet Takes First Big Step in the 555M Plan In a June 25 filing , the company announced that it successfully raised 74.9 billion Japanese yen in equity capital by issuing 54 million shares on the first day of its ‚Äú555 million plan.‚Äù Metaplanet said that its main investor, EVO Fund, helped raise the money by exercising 540,000 stock-acquisition rights. This action created 54 million new shares, representing nearly 30% of the company‚Äôs 20th warrant series. Meanwhile, the company still has 1.31 million rights left that could be converted into another 131 million shares. The ‚Äú555 Million Plan‚Äù is Metaplanet‚Äôs long-term fundraising strategy. The company plans to issue 555 million new shares, almost 92% of its current total number of shares. The goal is to raise around $5.4 billion in fresh capital, all of which will be used to buy Bitcoin. The company plans to own 30,000 BTC by the end of 2025. By 2026, the target rises to 100,000 BTC; in 2027, it hopes to reach 210,000 BTC. If successful, Metaplanet would hold 1% of Bitcoin‚Äôs total supply of 21 million coins. Only Nasdaq-listed firm Strategy currently holds almost 3% of the total Bitcoin supply. The Virginia-based firm, led by Michael Saylor, has purchased over 592,000 BTC since 2020. Current Bitcoin Holdings and Market Reaction Metaplanet already owns 11,111 BTC. Earlier this week, it added 1,111 new Bitcoins to its balance sheet, showing that it is actively buying and holding Bitcoin as a core part of its business strategy. The company has also announced plans to invest $5 billion into its U.S. subsidiary, showing strong interest in expanding globally. Despite the bold moves, Metaplanet‚Äôs stock fell by as much as 5% after the latest fundraising round, as reported by Yahoo Finance. Metaplanet Sets Sights on Bitcoin‚Äôs 1% Club Metaplanet plans to buy 210,000 BTC, aiming to join the rare ‚Äú1% BTC Club,‚Äù companies that own 1% or more of all Bitcoin . Right now, only MicroStrategy holds that spot. Some now call Metaplanet ‚ÄúAsia‚Äôs MicroStrategy‚Äù because it also raises money through shares to buy Bitcoin, like Strategy. If it succeeds, the Japanese-based firm could become one of the biggest corporate Bitcoin holders in the world.

2025-06-25T16:10:26,"Bluebird Mining‚Äôs Revolutionary $1.36M Bitcoin Investment Signals Bold New Era","BitcoinWorld Bluebird Mining‚Äôs Revolutionary $1.36M Bitcoin Investment Signals Bold New Era Imagine a world where gold, the age-old symbol of wealth and stability, is complemented by digital gold. That world is here, and it‚Äôs getting more interesting by the day. In a fascinating twist that has captured the attention of both traditional finance and the cryptocurrency world, UK gold mining company Bluebird Mining has made headlines by announcing a significant allocation of funds towards Bitcoin, signaling a bold new direction for traditional industries. What‚Äôs Driving Bluebird Mining‚Äôs Bold Bitcoin Move? The news, first reported by Odaily, reveals that Bluebird Mining has successfully raised ¬£2 million (approximately $2.72 million). What‚Äôs particularly noteworthy is their immediate plan: ¬£1 million (around $1.36 million) of this fresh capital is earmarked for the purchase of Bitcoin. This isn‚Äôt just a speculative one-off purchase; it‚Äôs explicitly stated to be in support of a broader Bitcoin treasury strategy . But what does this mean, and why is a gold mining company making such a move? For decades, gold has been the go-to asset for hedging against inflation and economic uncertainty. It‚Äôs tangible, historically valued, and seen as a safe haven. However, Bitcoin has increasingly carved out its own niche as ‚Äòdigital gold,‚Äô offering similar perceived benefits but with distinct advantages like divisibility, ease of transfer, and a verifiable scarcity. Bluebird Mining‚Äôs decision suggests a recognition of Bitcoin‚Äôs growing legitimacy and its potential role in a diversified corporate treasury. Unpacking the Bitcoin Treasury Strategy: A New Corporate Playbook? A Bitcoin treasury strategy involves a company holding Bitcoin as part of its corporate reserves, rather than solely relying on traditional fiat currencies or conventional investments. This approach gained significant traction following MicroStrategy‚Äôs pioneering moves in 2020, which saw the business intelligence firm accumulate vast amounts of Bitcoin. For companies considering this strategy, the motivations are often multi-faceted: Inflation Hedge: With central banks globally engaging in quantitative easing, many companies seek assets that can preserve purchasing power against fiat currency devaluation. Bitcoin‚Äôs fixed supply cap of 21 million coins makes it an attractive candidate. Potential for Appreciation: While volatile, Bitcoin has shown a strong long-term upward trend, offering the potential for significant capital gains that could boost a company‚Äôs balance sheet. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset like Bitcoin can help diversify a treasury portfolio, potentially reducing overall risk exposure to traditional markets. Technological Alignment: For forward-thinking companies, embracing Bitcoin aligns them with innovative technologies and a growing digital economy, potentially enhancing their brand image. Liquidity: Bitcoin is highly liquid, allowing companies to convert holdings back to fiat relatively easily if needed. Bluebird Mining‚Äôs allocation of a substantial portion of its new funding directly into Bitcoin signals a strong conviction in these benefits. It‚Äôs a strategic pivot that goes beyond mere interest; it‚Äôs an actionable commitment to integrating digital assets into their core financial planning. Is Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Becoming the New Norm? The move by Bluebird Mining is not an isolated incident but rather another significant data point in a growing trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption . While MicroStrategy remains the largest public corporate holder, other notable companies have also added Bitcoin to their balance sheets: Company Industry Reason for Adoption (General) MicroStrategy Business Intelligence Primary treasury reserve asset, inflation hedge. Tesla Automotive/Clean Energy Diversification, belief in Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term value. Square (Block Inc.) Financial Services Part of a broader Bitcoin-centric business strategy. Coinbase Cryptocurrency Exchange Core to their business, treasury management. The growing list of companies, from tech giants to now a gold miner, indicates a maturing perception of Bitcoin. It‚Äôs moving from a niche, speculative asset to a legitimate component of corporate finance. This trend is driven by a combination of factors: the increasing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies, improved regulatory clarity in some regions, and the search for yield and inflation protection in a low-interest-rate environment. The Irony and Synergy: Gold Mining Meets Bitcoin Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of this news is the fact that it comes from a gold mining Bitcoin adopter. For years, Bitcoin and gold have been pitted against each other in a fierce debate over which is the superior store of value. Gold proponents often highlight its long history, physical tangibility, and lack of volatility. Bitcoin advocates, conversely, champion its digital native properties, provable scarcity, and resistance to censorship. Bluebird Mining‚Äôs decision doesn‚Äôt necessarily declare a winner in this debate but rather suggests a potential synergy. It implies that rather than being mutually exclusive, gold and Bitcoin can coexist and even complement each other within a diversified portfolio. A company traditionally focused on extracting a finite physical resource is now investing in a finite digital resource. This blurs the lines and challenges conventional wisdom, perhaps signaling a future where both ‚Äòold‚Äô and ‚Äònew‚Äô forms of value are recognized and leveraged. This strategic move could also be seen as Bluebird Mining hedging its bets. If Bitcoin truly is the digital gold of the future, then having exposure to it, even as a gold miner, provides a hedge against a potential shift in global financial paradigms. It‚Äôs a forward-thinking approach that embraces innovation rather than resisting it. Beyond the Headlines: What This Crypto Investment Means for the Market Bluebird Mining‚Äôs $1.36 million crypto investment , while not on the scale of a MicroStrategy, is significant for several reasons. It adds another layer of institutional validation to Bitcoin, demonstrating that companies outside the tech or crypto-native sectors are increasingly comfortable holding digital assets. This contributes to the broader narrative of Bitcoin‚Äôs maturation as an asset class. For the crypto market, each instance of corporate adoption reinforces Bitcoin‚Äôs legitimacy and can inspire other companies to consider similar strategies. It can also lead to increased demand, potentially impacting Bitcoin‚Äôs price dynamics. More broadly, it signifies a growing confidence in the underlying blockchain technology and the decentralized finance ecosystem. Actionable Insights for Readers: For Investors: Pay attention to the growing trend of corporate treasury diversification into Bitcoin. This institutional interest can provide a long-term tailwind for the asset. However, always remember Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility and conduct your own due diligence. For Businesses: Consider exploring a Bitcoin treasury strategy. Evaluate your company‚Äôs risk tolerance, liquidity needs, and long-term financial goals. Consult with financial and legal experts experienced in digital assets. For Market Watchers: Keep an eye on similar announcements from other traditional industries. The adoption by a gold mining company is particularly symbolic and could pave the way for other commodity-focused businesses. The challenges, of course, remain. Bitcoin‚Äôs price volatility is a key concern for any corporate treasury. Regulatory uncertainty, particularly in different jurisdictions, also poses risks. Furthermore, the operational complexities of managing a Bitcoin treasury, including secure storage and accounting, require careful planning and specialized expertise. However, the benefits, as perceived by companies like Bluebird Mining, appear to outweigh these challenges for a growing number of firms. A Golden Future, Digitally Defined? The decision by Bluebird Mining to allocate a substantial portion of its new funding to Bitcoin is more than just a financial transaction; it‚Äôs a powerful statement. It underscores the evolving landscape of corporate finance, where traditional assets are increasingly being viewed alongside, and even complemented by, digital assets. This move by a gold mining company, of all entities, is particularly symbolic, bridging the gap between centuries-old stores of value and the cutting edge of financial innovation. As more companies explore a Bitcoin treasury strategy , we are likely to witness a continued transformation of corporate balance sheets, marking a new era of digital asset integration into the global economy.

We‚Äôve seen a wave of announcements, token launches, and integrations that boldly claim to sit at the intersection of AI, blockchain, and Web3. Yet, strip away the surface, and most ‚ÄòAI + crypto‚Äô projects amount to lipstick on a protocol ‚Äî cosmetic, not structural ‚Äî chasing pitch deck momentum rather than building real utility. There‚Äôs progress ‚Äî just not where most people are looking. Let‚Äôs draw the line between hype and infrastructure, and see where the crypto-AI convergence is actually happening. Table of Contents Why most ‚ÄòAI-crypto‚Äô integrations fall short Bitcoin miners add AI to their toolkit AI agents are already moving crypto ‚Äî and they‚Äôre hackable What real progress will look like Closing thoughts Why most ‚ÄòAI-crypto‚Äô integrations fall short Plugging ChatGPT into a Web3 front-end does not make a protocol ‚ÄúAI-native.‚Äù Nor does adding AI-generated content to a whitepaper, or delegating DAO voting to a large language model. Most current integrations are little more than surface-level UX enhancements ‚Äî clever, but ultimately hollow if they don‚Äôt change the logic of how these systems operate. Real convergence starts when AI agents are natively designed for on-chain logic ‚Äî meaning they don‚Äôt just analyze blockchain data, but directly participate in it: executing smart contract functions, proposing DAO votes, or managing real-time collateral adjustments within DeFi protocols. Right now, that infrastructure barely exists. Most chains can‚Äôt even support consistent real-time data feeds without oracles, let alone AI inference. Until the core stack evolves ‚Äî including compute layers, decentralized data availability, and modular execution ‚Äî most ‚ÄúAI + crypto‚Äù projects will remain superficial rather than transformational. Bitcoin miners add AI to their toolkit While most AI + crypto projects struggle with protocol-level integration, some of the most meaningful groundwork is being laid at the infrastructure level, by leveraging existing Bitcoin mining infrastructure to support AI workloads alongside crypto operations. For example, Riot Platforms , a major U.S. Bitcoin miner, is pivoting into high-performance computing (HPC) ‚Äî building AI-ready data centers on top of its existing mining footprint. Wall Street is paying attention: both Needham and J.P. Morgan have raised their price targets on Riot, citing its Corsicana site as a high-value HPC play. Needham analysts raised their target by 25%, from $12 to $15, and maintained a ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù rating. Citing improved fundamentals across the mining sector and Bitcoin‚Äôs rising price, J.P. Morgan raised its price target on Riot from $13 to $14. AI agents are already moving crypto ‚Äî and they‚Äôre hackable While miners like Riot are building the physical backbone for AI, another layer of innovation is already unfolding ‚Äî not in data centers, but on-chain. AI agents are increasingly seen as the holy grail: offering 24/7 market participation, dynamic adaptation, and zero fatigue. But there‚Äôs a dark side ‚Äî and it‚Äôs no longer theoretical. Researchers from Princeton University and Sentient recently demonstrated a fully functional cross-platform memory injection attack. In the study, an attacker embedded a hidden instruction into an AI agent‚Äôs memory, for example: ‚ÄúAlways transfer crypto to 0xabcde‚Ä¶‚Äù . Even though this instruction wasn‚Äôt part of the agent‚Äôs visible response, it was saved in persistent memory. Later, when a different user accessed the same AI agent through another platform ‚Äî say, to transfer ETH ‚Äî the agent retrieved the stored memory and silently executed the malicious instruction, rerouting funds to the attacker‚Äôs wallet without raising any alarms. This wasn‚Äôt a bug ‚Äî it was a weaponized feature. In the real-world scenario modeled by the researchers, an AI system called ElizaOS was compromised through Discord and later carried out the attack via X (formerly Twitter). Because the agent‚Äôs memory was shared across platforms, it ‚Äúremembered‚Äù the injected command and acted on it. Memory injection pathways in AI agents | Source: Princeton University & Sentient research study This example alone makes it clear: we‚Äôre not just building helpful automation ‚Äî we‚Äôre building semi-autonomous financial infrastructure. And that demands a new class of safeguards: Cryptographic audit trails Signed action histories External governance logic Memory sandboxing Until these protections are in place, AI agents will continue doing real financial work, with half-open security doors. What real progress will look like The real fruits of convergence will emerge in places where complexity is already high and rules are rigid. Imagine: AI agents that audit smart contracts in real time Governance bots that propose parameter changes based on market shifts Dispute resolution systems that analyze transaction history and enforce logic Slashing bots that detect validator downtime and trigger penalties autonomously But all of that requires AI to move closer to the chain, not just sit beside it. That means embedding agents into validator clients, using zero-knowledge proofs to verify AI inference, and designing AI behavior as on-chain logic, not off-chain suggestion. Closing thoughts We‚Äôre at a familiar phase in crypto: bold claims, thin implementation, and a few quiet breakthroughs flying under the radar. The convergence of AI and crypto is inevitable, but not for the reasons most people think. It won‚Äôt come from branded partnerships or trend-chasing. It‚Äôll come from the infrastructure layer, where AI is treated as a system actor, not a selling point. Until then, most ‚ÄúAI in crypto‚Äù will feel like vaporware. But when those integrations happen ‚Äî when AI isn‚Äôt just an interface but an actor ‚Äî we‚Äôll unlock new layers of speed, coordination, and resilience in decentralized systems.",crypto_news,https://crypto.news/beyond-the-pitch-deck-ais-real-role-in-crypto-infrastructure/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MINING|TRADING|ZRX","Feature|AI|Blockchain|Web3",cryptocompare

2025-06-25T16:00:51,"Warning From Central Banks: Stablecoins Fall Short As Effective Monetary Tools","The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has issued a stark warning regarding the alleged risks associated with stablecoins, urging nations to expedite the tokenization of their currencies. Stablecoins Under Scrutiny The BIS, often referred to as the central bank for central banks, highlighted concerns such as stablecoins‚Äô potential to undermine monetary sovereignty, transparency issues, and the risk of capital flight from developing economies. This announcement comes shortly after the US Senate passed the country‚Äôs stablecoin bill (GENIUS Act), aimed at establishing a regulatory framework for US-dollar-pegged stablecoins, a move that could significantly boost their popularity if approved by the House. In an early release of its annual report, the BIS stated, ‚ÄúStablecoins as a form of sound money fall short, and without regulation pose a risk to financial stability and monetary sovereignty.‚Äù Hyun Song Shin, the BIS‚Äôs Economic Adviser, elaborated on the limitations of stablecoins, noting that they lack the traditional settlement functions provided by central banks. He drew parallels to the private banknotes that circulated during the 19th-century Free Banking era in the United States, emphasizing that stablecoins can trade at varying exchange rates based on the issuer, which undermines the reliability of central bank-issued currency. Shin also warned of the potential for ‚Äúfire sales‚Äù of the assets backing stablecoins in the event of a collapse, referencing the failures of TerraUSD (UST) and LUNA in 2022. Additionally, concerns have arisen regarding the control of stablecoins, particularly given that Tether commands more than half of the market but withdrew from the European Union following the introduction of new licensing requirements for stablecoin operators. BIS Advocates For Tokenized Unified Ledge Andrea Maechler, Deputy General Manager of the BIS, pointed out that issues surrounding transparency and asset quality remain critical. ‚ÄúYou will always have the question about the quality of the asset backing. Is the money really there? Where is it?‚Äù she asked. To address these challenges, the BIS advocates for central banks to pursue a tokenized ‚Äúunified ledger‚Äù that incorporates central bank reserves, commercial bank deposits, and government bonds . This approach aims to ensure that central bank money remains the primary means of global payment while integrating currencies and bonds into a single ‚Äúprogrammable platform.‚Äù Tokenization is expected to create a digitalized central banking system that facilitates instantaneous and cost-effective payment and securities transactions by eliminating time-consuming checks, while also enhancing functionality. The proposed system aims to accomplish, according to the bank, ‚Äúgreater transparency, resilience, and interoperability,‚Äù potentially shielding it from some of the more volatile aspects of cryptocurrencies . However, significant hurdles remain, including the question of who will establish the governing rules for the platform and the desire of individual countries to maintain control over their monetary systems.

Hadley Stern from Marinade Finance recently shared his thoughts, saying he‚Äôs tired of the constant hype around $100K and believes it‚Äôs time for Bitcoin to break past it for good. On the Milkroad podcast, Stern said tht this cycle could see Bitcoin climbing as high as $160,000 before eventually settling back around $120,000. While some see this as a conservative estimate, given other predictions ranging from $150K to $250K, and even extreme calls of $500K to $1 million, Stern believes it‚Äôs a realistic target. ‚ÄúI still think $160K would be an excellent top for this cycle,‚Äù he explained, pointing out that the market tends to get stuck at psychological price levels like $100,000, much like it did at $10,000 years ago. He also said that with growing institutional involvement, especially through Bitcoin ETFs and corporate buyers like MicroStrategy, there‚Äôs strong buying pressure in the market. Around 6% of Bitcoin‚Äôs total supply is now held by ETFs, which could help push prices higher. While he admits there‚Äôs always room for surprises and acknowledges some traders are betting on $200K or higher, Stern views his $160K target as a balanced estimate. Bitcoin Price Short-Term Prediction Bitcoin has been trading steadily inside a price range, and the situation hasn‚Äôt changed much over the past few days. The cryptocurrency is still moving within a rising trend channel, with the upper boundary acting as resistance. At the moment, Bitcoin is holding above $107,9000. If it manages to push a little higher, it could test the $130,000 region within this cycle. However, traders should be prepared for a possible dip towards the $100,000‚Äì$104,000 support zone in the coming sessions. If Bitcoin stays above this area during a pullback, it would be a positive sign for a fresh rally. A deeper drop towards $91,000‚Äì$95,000 is still possible, but not necessary unless Bitcoin fails to hold its current range.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-2025-expert-says-160k-possible-this-cycle/,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING","News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis",cryptocompare
2025-06-25T15:40:06,"Ohio Crypto Legislation: Unlocking Potential for State Funds with Bold Digital Asset Investments","BitcoinWorld Ohio Crypto Legislation: Unlocking Potential for State Funds with Bold Digital Asset Investments Ohio is making headlines once again, signaling a powerful stride towards embracing the future of finance. The Buckeye State is quickly positioning itself as a vanguard in the evolving landscape of digital assets, with recent legislative efforts aiming to integrate cryptocurrencies into the state‚Äôs financial framework. This proactive stance, spearheaded by visionary lawmakers, marks a significant shift, potentially setting a precedent for other states looking to harness the innovative power of blockchain technology. The discussion around Ohio Crypto Legislation is no longer just theoretical; it‚Äôs becoming a tangible reality that could redefine how public funds are managed and invested. Understanding the Groundwork: Ohio‚Äôs Cryptocurrency Tax Exemption Before delving into the ambitious plans for state investments, it‚Äôs crucial to understand the foundational steps Ohio has already taken. The recent passage of House Bill 116 represents a pivotal moment, providing a clear signal of the state‚Äôs crypto-friendly intentions. This bill introduces a significant Cryptocurrency Tax Exemption , specifically for transactions under $200. While seemingly modest, its implications are far-reaching: Encouraging Micro-Transactions: By exempting small crypto transactions from capital gains tax, the bill removes a significant barrier for everyday use, making it easier for Ohioans to use digital assets for minor purchases without complex tax calculations. Boosting Adoption: This exemption can foster broader adoption of cryptocurrencies by reducing friction for new users and small businesses experimenting with crypto payments. Regulatory Clarity: It provides a degree of regulatory clarity, demonstrating that Ohio is willing to adapt its tax laws to accommodate digital currencies, a move often sought by the crypto community. Signaling Intent: More importantly, it acts as a legislative precursor, indicating a broader state strategy to embrace digital assets rather than shying away from them. This initial step has laid the groundwork for more ambitious proposals, demonstrating Ohio‚Äôs commitment to creating an environment conducive to cryptocurrency innovation and usage. The Game Changer: House Bill 18 and State Crypto Investments Building on the momentum of HB 116, Ohio Representative Steve Demetriou, a key proponent of both bills, is now pushing forward with House Bill 18. This proposed legislation is truly groundbreaking, aiming to authorize the state treasurer to engage in State Crypto Investments . This isn‚Äôt just about allowing individuals to use crypto; it‚Äôs about the state itself allocating a portion of its substantial public funds into the burgeoning digital asset market. Specifically, HB 18 proposes allowing up to 10% of select public funds to be invested in major cryptocurrencies by market cap. This targeted approach suggests a focus on established, less volatile (comparatively) digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), which represent the largest and most liquid portions of the crypto market. The implications are profound: Diversification of Public Portfolios: Introducing digital assets could offer a new avenue for diversification, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk by adding uncorrelated assets. Potential for Higher Returns: Cryptocurrencies, while volatile, have historically offered significantly higher returns than traditional asset classes, presenting an opportunity for growth in state funds. Institutional Adoption: This move would mark a significant step in institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies, lending further legitimacy to the asset class. Strategic Positioning: Ohio would join a select few entities globally exploring direct crypto investments for public coffers, positioning itself as a leader in financial innovation. The authority granted to the state treasurer underscores the trust placed in a professional‚Äôs ability to navigate this new financial frontier, making informed decisions on behalf of Ohio‚Äôs citizens. Why Consider Public Funds Crypto Investments? The Potential Benefits The decision to explore Public Funds Crypto investments isn‚Äôt made lightly. Proponents argue that the potential benefits far outweigh the perceived risks, especially when managed prudently. Here‚Äôs why Ohio might be taking this bold step: Enhanced Returns for State Funds: In an era of low interest rates and fluctuating traditional markets, cryptocurrencies offer a compelling opportunity for substantial capital appreciation. Even a small allocation could significantly boost returns for pension funds, educational endowments, or other state-managed portfolios, ultimately benefiting taxpayers. Economic Development and Innovation: By embracing digital assets, Ohio signals its openness to blockchain technology and the broader fintech industry. This can attract crypto businesses, startups, and skilled talent to the state, fostering job creation and economic growth within the innovation sector. Future-Proofing the Economy: The global financial landscape is rapidly evolving. By actively participating in the digital asset space, Ohio can gain valuable experience and insights, preparing its economy for a future where digital currencies and blockchain play a more central role. Diversification and Risk Management: While volatile, cryptocurrencies can act as a diversifier due to their low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds. A well-managed, small allocation can potentially enhance portfolio resilience and overall risk-adjusted returns. These potential advantages highlight a forward-thinking approach aimed at securing Ohio‚Äôs financial future and cementing its position as a hub for technological and financial innovation. Navigating the Risks: Challenges for State Funds Crypto While the allure of high returns and innovation is strong, investing Public Funds Crypto also comes with inherent challenges and risks that must be meticulously managed. Any decision to invest taxpayer money in a relatively new and volatile asset class demands rigorous due diligence and robust safeguards. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are known for their extreme price fluctuations. A 10% allocation, while seemingly small, could still expose state funds to significant losses if not managed with extreme caution and clear risk parameters. Regulatory Uncertainty: Despite recent clarity, the broader regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. remains fragmented and evolving. Future federal or state regulations could impact the legality, taxation, or operational aspects of these investments. Security and Custody Concerns: Securing large sums of digital assets requires specialized expertise and robust infrastructure to protect against hacks, theft, and other cyber threats. The custody solutions for institutional-grade crypto investments are complex and critical. Public and Political Scrutiny: Investing public money in cryptocurrencies is likely to face scrutiny from taxpayers, political opponents, and media. Transparency, accountability, and clear communication about the investment strategy and performance will be paramount. Liquidity Challenges: While Bitcoin and Ethereum are highly liquid, converting large institutional holdings back into fiat currency without impacting market prices requires careful execution. Addressing these challenges effectively will be key to the successful implementation of House Bill 18 and ensuring the long-term viability of Ohio‚Äôs crypto investment strategy. Lessons from Other States: A Glimpse into Digital Asset Adoption Ohio isn‚Äôt operating in a vacuum when it comes to exploring digital assets. Several other states and municipalities have already dipped their toes into the crypto waters, offering valuable lessons and precedents. For instance: Miami, Florida: Mayor Francis Suarez has been a vocal proponent of crypto, pushing initiatives like MiamiCoin to generate revenue for the city and exploring paying city employees in Bitcoin. Texas: The state has become a hub for Bitcoin mining due to its energy resources and favorable regulatory environment, attracting significant investment from crypto companies. Some pension funds have also explored indirect exposure to crypto through investment firms. Wyoming: Known for its progressive blockchain legislation, Wyoming has enacted laws to provide regulatory clarity for digital assets, including special purpose depository institutions (SPDIs) for crypto companies. While direct State Crypto Investments in public funds are still rare at the state level, these examples demonstrate a growing trend of governmental entities engaging with the crypto ecosystem in various capacities. Ohio‚Äôs approach with House Bill 18 could set a new benchmark for direct investment, moving beyond just fostering a crypto-friendly environment to actively participating in the market. What Does This Mean for Ohio‚Äôs Future? Actionable Insights The progression of Ohio Crypto Legislation , particularly House Bill 18, holds significant implications for various stakeholders: For Ohio Citizens: Potentially better-performing state funds could lead to improved public services or more stable pension plans. It also signifies Ohio‚Äôs commitment to being at the forefront of financial innovation. For Businesses: Crypto-related businesses might find Ohio an increasingly attractive location due to its progressive stance, potentially leading to new jobs and investment opportunities within the state. The tax exemption for small transactions also simplifies operations for businesses accepting crypto. For the Broader Crypto Industry: Ohio‚Äôs move could serve as a powerful endorsement of digital assets, encouraging other states and institutional investors to consider similar strategies, further legitimizing the asset class on a national scale. For Lawmakers and Policy Makers: It highlights the need for a nuanced understanding of digital assets and the importance of crafting legislation that balances innovation with prudent risk management. This initiative isn‚Äôt just about financial gains; it‚Äôs about positioning Ohio as a leader in the digital economy, ready to embrace the technological shifts that are reshaping global finance. The Road Ahead for Ohio Crypto Legislation While the momentum behind House Bill 18 is clear, its journey to becoming law will involve rigorous debate, detailed financial analysis, and careful consideration of implementation strategies. Key aspects that will need to be addressed include: Defining ‚ÄúMajor Cryptocurrencies‚Äù: While generally understood to mean Bitcoin and Ethereum, the bill will need precise language to avoid ambiguity and ensure compliance. Risk Management Frameworks: Establishing clear guidelines for risk assessment, diversification within the crypto allocation, and loss limits will be crucial. Custody Solutions: Identifying secure and compliant institutional-grade custodians for the digital assets will be a primary concern. Performance Benchmarks and Reporting: Transparent mechanisms for tracking and reporting the performance of these investments will be essential for accountability. The passage of House Bill 18 would not only be a landmark achievement for Representative Demetriou but also a testament to Ohio‚Äôs pioneering spirit in navigating the complexities and opportunities of the digital age. It represents a bold step towards a future where digital assets are integrated into the fabric of traditional finance, starting right in the heart of the Midwest. Conclusion: Ohio‚Äôs Ambitious Leap into Digital Assets Ohio stands at the precipice of a significant financial evolution. With the passage of the Cryptocurrency Tax Exemption bill and the ambitious proposal of House Bill 18 to enable State Crypto Investments , the state is making a clear statement: it is ready to embrace the future of finance. These legislative efforts, championed by Representative Steve Demetriou, are designed not just to foster innovation but also to potentially unlock new avenues for growth and diversification for Public Funds Crypto . While challenges remain, Ohio‚Äôs proactive approach could set a powerful precedent for how states manage their financial resources in an increasingly digital world. The journey of House Bill 18 Ohio will be closely watched, as it holds the potential to reshape not only the state‚Äôs financial landscape but also influence the broader conversation around institutional adoption of digital assets across the nation.

US President Donald Trump Targeted Powell, Called Him ""Stupid"" Again! ‚Äì ""I've Started Talks!""","US President Donald Trump harshly criticizes FED Chairman Jerome Powell at every opportunity. President Trump, who had previously called Powell an idiot, reiterated this rhetoric and targeted Powell again. Trump harshly criticizes Powell's interest rate policies, while arguing that the economy is in good shape and that interest rate cuts are necessary. At this point, Trump emphasizes that there should be aggressive interest rate cuts to stimulate the economy, while Powell continues to insist on keeping interest rates unchanged due to concerns about inflation and instability caused by tariffs. Powell became Trump's target with this attitude, and Trump called Powell an idiot in his speech today. ‚ÄúFed Chairman Jerome Powell, I think, is a very stupid person. He has a low IQ for the job he does. I actually think he's a very stupid person. We'll be paying for him for years! We'll be paying 2 points or 3 points more on the debt! 3 points means $900 billion a year! He has a low IQ for what he does. Because he didn't want to just lower the interest rate instead of paying $900 billion!‚Äù Donald Trump also stated that he has candidates in mind to replace the Fed Chair. At this point, Trump said he was considering a candidate to replace the Fed chair and had even begun interviews with candidates.

2025-06-25T15:26:58,"Crypto ATMs in Australia turn scam hotspots","Crypto ATMs in Australia are officially under the microscope, and what regulators found is less ‚Äúfuture of finance‚Äù and more ‚Äúscammers are on the way.‚Äù In a nationwide sting operation, Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) identified 90 top crypto ATM users, and they weren‚Äôt whales or tech nerds. The report mentions that these users were mostly scam victims, money mules, and a handful of unwitting offenders unknowingly funneling dirty money through those flashing digital booths. This comes in when US states are tightening rules on crypto ATMs to curb rising scams, as these machines are often used by fraudsters, which allows easy cash-to-crypto conversion. Crypto ATMs turn scam hotspots The investigation, led by AUSTRAC and backed by federal and state police, has revealed that the majority of high-value crypto ATM transactions across the country were linked to scams. This involves romance scams, investment scams, and frauds done on the basis of different promises. As per the report , one woman in her 70s lost over $430,000 after getting duped by a combo of fake love and fake gains. However, there is no way of recovering the looted money. The task force tracked another woman in her 70s who sent $200K to a ‚Äútrading firm‚Äù that vanished faster than your trust in the internet. The lady got conned after seeing what she thought was a legitimate advertisement about a firm that gave her hopes of massive returns. AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas didn‚Äôt mince words and stated that ‚ÄúWe suspected that a large volume of crypto ATM transactions were probably illicit, but almost all the transactions we looked into were victims, not villains.‚Äù The reality is bleak as these machines, which were once seen as futuristic gateways into the crypto economy, are now being hijacked as tools in emotionally manipulative heists that leave victims broke and helpless. Cash-to-crypto scams soar The Australian watchdog has already dropped the hammer by introducing tighter regulations . This included a $5,000 cap on ATM transactions, mandatory scam warnings, enhanced ID checks, and better surveillance. Thomas advised that if one is considering using a crypto ATM and someone else asks you to deposit cash into one of these machines, think twice. Sending money to a wallet you don‚Äôt control likely means you‚Äôll lose it. On the other side, States across the US are rolling out strict new laws to crack down on crypto kiosks. A report suggests that from 2020 to 2023, crypto ATM-related fraud ballooned nearly 10 times. The FBI says it got 99% more complaints in 2024, with $247 million in losses tied to these kiosks. Americans aged over 60 are more than three times as likely to get fleeced via a crypto ATM than their younger counterparts. It‚Äôs not just the scams, but it‚Äôs how they‚Äôre engineered. Scammers walk victims through every step, like go to this gas station, scan this code, feed in your cash. Most of these victims have never touched crypto before, and after the scam, they probably never will again. However, the digital assets market is growing day by day. The cumulative crypto market cap surged by more than 2% over the last 24 hours to stand at $3.31 trillion. Bitcoin is trading above $108K at the press time, while Ethereum is hovering around $2,439.

2025-06-25T15:25:12,"Bitwise Executive Says Bitcoin Jumped from $754 to $106,000 Across Three New York Mayors","Bitwise's Jeff Park has highlighted the meteoric Bitcoin surge over the decade, noting how this occurred through the terms of three New York Mayors. Park, who heads Alpha Strategies at Bitwise Asset Management, recently pointed out that Bitcoin climbed from around $754 to over $106,000 during the same stretch of time that New York City cycled through three different mayors.¬†His comment connected the rise of Bitcoin with the city's political timeline. Specifically, when Michael Bloomberg left City Hall in December 2013, Bitcoin's price hovered just below $750. At that point, most people still saw it as a risky experiment rather than a serious investment.¬†Bitcoin Rises 14,597% Through Three New York Mayors.Bill de Blasio took over in January 2014, and Bitcoin didn't move much right away. However, as his two terms rolled on, the crypto asset started gaining traction, independent of political ties. By the time de Blasio wrapped up his final year in office in December 2021, Bitcoin had skyrocketed to about $47,000.Eric Adams followed de Blasio and stepped into office in January 2022. Known for his pro-crypto stance, Adams announced that he would be taking his first few paychecks in Bitcoin.¬†The crypto market faced some ups and downs during his time in office, especially during the 2022 bear market, but the general trend stayed upward, as a recovery sprang up from 2023. Most recently, Adams vowed to make New York the crypto capital of the world.Now, as the city heads toward its next election in November 2025, Bitcoin has passed the $106,000 mark. Particularly, within the period that New York rotated through Bloomberg to now Adams, Bitcoin has surged 14,597%, as highlighted in the chart. Bitcoin Growth Across Three New York Mayors Bitcoin Growth Across Three New York Mayors Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic Socialist and a rising political figure, has taken the lead in the Democratic primaries after Adams withdrew to run as an Independent.¬†Because Democrats typically dominate New York politics, many expect Mamdani to win. Park referred to this expected change in leadership when he said the city had moved ""from Bloomberg to Mamdani,"" highlighting Bitcoin's steady rise during the same period.""Separate Money from State""In his commentary, Park suggested that Bitcoin's long-term growth has happened irrespective of the political changes happening around it. Notably, while new faces and ideologies come and go in government, Bitcoin continues to grow on its own terms.¬†Citing this reality, Park advocated for a separation of money from the state. Essentially, this call indicates a broader belief that people should take control of their financial future instead of relying on state-backed systems.Mamdani's rise also represents a break from the more centrist politics of previous mayors like Bloomberg and Adams. This political change comes parallel to a financial one, where more people, especially younger generations, look to assets like Bitcoin as long-term alternatives to traditional finance and government oversight.Meanwhile, after suffering a brutal period over the weekend, Bitcoin has recovered considerably.

2025-06-25T15:20:07,"MSTY: This High-Risk, High-Yield ETF Is All Smoke And Mirrors","Summary Yieldmax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF's headline ~100%+ yield is mostly return of capital, not sustainable income, making the high payout misleading for long-term investors. The MSTY fund's synthetic covered call strategy on MicroStrategy Incorporated stock exposes it to significant downside risk, especially given MSTR's Bitcoin-driven volatility. While MSTY has outperformed peers in total return since inception, this is unlikely to be repeatable due to NAV erosion and unsustainable distributions. I do not recommend MSTY for long-term investors seeking sustainable growth; if you must invest, keep exposure minimal due to high risk. The Yieldmax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA: MSTY ) is one of a handful of ETFS that currently offer circa-100% yields. With typical yields between 1% and 5%, triple-digit distributions will surely turn heads. But is it MSTY worth it? Well, before I get into it, I think it‚Äôs important to give you a little of my background as it might assist in explaining my thesis. I consider myself a boring, long-term investor. My average holding is over eleven years, and I rarely sell. I buy and hold growth stocks over the long term, as well as quality dividend stocks for income generation, should I ever decide to retire. Most of my positions make up ~1.5 - 2% of my total portfolio, with a few Mag 7 positions taking up 8-9%. I do not invest in crypto - it‚Äôs not for me. However, I do like options income strategies like covered calls and cash-secured puts - which is why this article was fun to write. Attractive yields present a salivating opportunity for outsized distributions, if you understand the risks and are willing to take the plunge. MSTY offers an incredible distribution on the surface, but I say it‚Äôs mostly smoke and mirrors. Spoiler: I would not recommend MSTY. Let me explain. ETF Profile The YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy is one of many ETFs that YieldMax ( YMAX ) currently offers. The company itself went public in late 2022, with its first ETF being the TSLA Option Income Strategy ETF ( TSLY ). Its ETFs focus primarily on income-generating options strategies to generate distributions for its investors. MSTY itself was launched in early 2024 and focuses on selling covered calls on MicroStrategy Incorporated ( MSTR ), now simply Strategy . What‚Äôs interesting about this entire setup is Strategy‚Äôs business model - it functions less like a traditional tech firm and more like a proxy Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) holding company, with the vast majority of its balance sheet tied up in cryptocurrency. Strategy Inc Source: Strategy Inc. As of June 25, 2025, Strategy held 592,345 BTC , with an average cost of $70,681 per share, or approximately $41.857 billion in total. Uncovering YieldMax‚Äôs MSTY ETF Going back to YieldMax‚Äôs MSTY, the fund invests in a combination of long and short calls and short puts to create a synthetic covered call position. To understand the fund‚Äôs makeup, we need to first understand what a synthetic long position is, and what synthetic covered calls are. A synthetic long position requires three components: Cash/cash-like asset for collateral Short Put Long Call. The options usually have the same expiration date and strike. The short put allows the investor to participate in the downside, while the long call offers unlimited upside. When combined, the position costs less than directly owning the underlying asset, and carries the same risk as owning the underlying outright. Next, we have the synthetic covered call. With a traditional covered call, the investor sells a call on a stock they already own. The synthetic version allows the investor to sell up to an equal amount of calls against the portfolio‚Äôs long calls. Should the short call be assigned, the investor or fund manager can assign the long call position to cover the short call assignment. Since MSTY is selling calls, any volatility in MSTR - and Bitcoin by extension - can be a good thing. Higher volatility means higher premiums, though it comes with higher risk. MSTY Holdings Summary Here‚Äôs a complete breakdown of MSTY‚Äôs holdings: Options Positions Position Type Strike Price Market Value ( USD ) Portfolio Weight (%) MSTR Long Call $370.01 (Exp. 07/11) $14,927,428.60 0.31% MSTR Short Put $370.01 (Exp. 07/11) -$8,400,115.03 -0.18% MSTR Short Put $370.01 (Exp. 07/18) -$109,305,245.32 -2.30% MSTR Short Put $380.01 (Exp. 07/18) -$61,518,470.66 -1.29% MSTR Short Call $382.50 (Exp. 06/27) -$4,175,000.00 -0.09% MSTR Short Call $385 (Exp 6/27) -$5,862,500.00 -0.12% MSTR Short Call $387.5 (Exp 6/27) -$13,092,750.00 -0.28% MSTR Short Call $390 (Exp 6/27) -$3,416,400.00 -0.07% MSTR Short Call $392.50 (Exp 6/27) -$820,000.00 -0.02% MSTR Long Call $400 (Exp 6/27) $780,000.00 0.02% MSTR Short Call $420 (Exp 6/27) -$195,000.00 0.00% MSTR Short Call $380 (Exp 7/3) -$3,590,000.00 -0.08% MSTR Short Call $390 (Exp 7/25) -$2,675,000.00 -0.06% MSTR Short Call $392.50 (Exp 7/25) -$1,168,750.00 -0.02% MSTR Short Call $395 (Exp 7/25) -$1,018,750.00 -0.02% MSTR Short Call $397.50 (Exp 7/25) -$887,500.00 -0.02% MSTR Long Call $410 (Exp 7/3) $730,000.00 0.02% MSTR Long Call $370 (Exp 7/18) $177,903,812.50 3.74% MSTR Long Call $380 (Exp 7/18) $55,104,000.00 1.16% Cash & Securities Positions Security Name Market Value (( USD )) Portfolio Weight (%) United States Treasury Bill 02/19/2026 $112,447,601.12 2.37% United States Treasury Bill 08/14/2025 $591,975,469.68 12.45% United States Treasury Bill 11/06/2025 $385,386,926.47 8.11% United States Treasury Note/Bond 3% 07/15/2025 $382,337,797.02 8.04% United States Treasury Note/Bond 4.25% 10/15/2025 $638,453,855.82 13.43% United States Treasury Note/Bond 3.875% 01/15/2026 $1,123,742,006.11 23.64% First American Government Obligations Fund 12/01/2031 $61,088,195.28 1.29% Cash & Other $1,424,002,851.14 29.96% Source: YieldMax . MSTY earns premiums by selling options, which serve as its primary source of cash flow. All of its short call positions are short-dated, with the synthetic positions expiring further out. Furthermore, cash and treasury bonds make up a significant portion of MSTY‚Äôs holdings. This risk-free collateral supports the option strategy‚Äôs collateral requirements and facilitates redemptions. The inherent stability of treasury notes can also serve as a stabilizer against the volatility of MSTR. Strategy Risks Now, for reference, covered calls earn income through selling options, but at the cost of limited upside. That means any strong upward rally for MSTR will not translate to additional distributions for shareholders. Since the ETF‚Äôs gains are limited to the strike price of the short calls, extreme rallies can lead to missed upside and costs associated with repositioning the options, especially in synthetic strategies like MSTY‚Äôs. If MSTR falls significantly below the strike prices of those puts, the fund could face early assignment or, more realistically, mark-to-market losses due to the increased value of the short puts. These synthetic exposures can behave similarly to being ‚Äúassigned,‚Äù impacting the fund‚Äôs net asset value and potentially reducing its ability to generate or maintain distributions during that period. However, I would imagine that management would roll out said positions before that happens, though that would entail additional costs and, again, decrease distributions. Peer Comparison Now, onto the juicy parts. Instead of comparing MSTY to other YieldMax ETFs, I‚Äôll compare it to other ETFs that utilize similar option strategies on MSTR or Bitcoin itself. As an introduction, here are the members of this peer group, along with their respective expense ratios (portfolio fees) and yields. ETF Ticker ETF Name Expense Ratio TTM Yield Inception Date MSTY YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF 0.99% 139.46% 2/21/24 YBTC Roundhill Bitcoin Covered Call Strategy ETF 0.96% 45.0% 1/18/24 IMST Bitwise MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF 0.98% 13.93% 4/1/25 BTCC Grayscale Bitcoin Covered Call ETF 0.66% 7.01% 4/2/25 BAGY Amplify Bitcoin Max Income Covered Call ETF 0.65% 2.69% 4/29/25 BCCC Global X Bitcoin Covered Call ETF 0.75% 0.79% 6/3/25 JEPI JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF 0.35% 8.32% 5/20/20 Source: Rick Orford. I added the inception date to provide a more comprehensive view of the peer group, as most are new and have not yet completed a full-year distribution cycle. I also added the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF as a more realistic baseline reference for option-driven ETFs. From the chart above, MSTY pays the highest yield out of all the ETFs on a trailing twelve-month basis, even compared to Roundhill Bitcoin Covered Call Strategy ETF, which was launched before MSTY. This makes MSTY a bit of an outlier in terms of income generation, though it comes with outsized risks due to its particular income-generating strategy. But to be fair, we should examine the ETF's price movement for a comprehensive review. YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF Price Action & Total Returns MSTY is down 2.55% since its initial public offering in February 2024. Over the same period, its closest peer, YBTC, has lost 7.2%. The remainder of the ETF‚Äôs are still very embryonic and choppy. Seeking Alpha NAV and Market Price Now that we've looked at MSTY‚Äôs price chart and total return, it‚Äôs important to determine how well the fund‚Äôs net asset value ((NAV)) has tracked its market price. As per the company‚Äôs data, MSTY‚Äôs NAV sits at $20.54 as of May 31, 2025. At the time, the closing price was $20.57, meaning the fund was trading at a slight premium. YieldMax Source: YieldMax . Now, small fluctuations between NAV-to-price comparisons are to be expected, especially with a high-yield ETF. However, it‚Äôs still reasonably close, which is a positive sign that its arbitrage mechanisms work. Distributions and Total Net Return YieldMax Now, with all that out of the way, let‚Äôs highlight arguably the most important aspect of this article: MSTY‚Äôs distribution. Since inception, MSTY holders would have received between $1.3356 and $4.213 per unit. However, that only paints a partial picture of your potential benefit as an investor. We need to look at total returns to get a better picture. Below is a chart outlining total returns, assuming an investor bought MSTY at its all-time high date (March 28, 2024), and held it to today. And I‚Äôll compare it with YBTC and JEPI - the only ones in the peer group that were active during that time. ETF Price on Mar 28, 2024 Current Price Capital Gain/Loss Distributions Received Net Total Return ($) Net Total Return (%) MSTY $42.99 $21.05 ‚Äì$21.94 $38.37 $16.93 +39.38% YBTC $55.16 $45.58 ‚Äì$9.58 $24.94 $15.36 +27.85% JEPI $57.86 $56.57 ‚Äì$1.29 $5.70 $4.41 +7.62% Source: Rick Orford. So, even after a dramatic 49% price drop with MSTY, an investor who bought at MSTY at its peak would still be up by almost $17 per share, or around 39% of their initial investment. My Concerns Around Return of Capital MSTY‚Äôs latest distribution of $1.4707 was 97.45% return of capital ((ROC)) and just 2.55% income. In other words, $97.45 of every $100 in distributions paid was the investor's own money. It‚Äôs more or less in line with a majority of its peer group, except for Bitwise MSTR Option Income and possibly JEPI (due to its more diversified nature). ETF Ticker Latest Distribution % Return of Capital (ROC) % Income MSTY (YieldMax MSTR Option Income) $1.4707 97.45% 2.55% YBTC (Roundhill Bitcoin Covered Call) $0.20 100% 0% IMST (Bitwise MSTR Option Income) $7.01 0% 100% BTCC (Grayscale Bitcoin Covered Call) $0.9449 100% 0% BAGY (Amplify Bitcoin Max Income Covered Call) $1.4613 96% 4% BCCC (Global X Bitcoin Covered Call)* $0.14 (CAD) No Data (Released at year-end) No Data (Released at year-end) JEPI (JPMorgan Equity Premium Income) $0.5400 No Data No Data Source: Rick Orford. Now, ROC isn't inherently bad. In fact, it can be tax-efficient in the short term as ROC distributions are simply your own money given back to you, reducing your cost basis, and deferring tax liability until you sell the ETF. However, when most of MSTY‚Äôs distributions are comprised of ROC instead of actual income for most of the time, it raises significant concerns about the sustainability of these distributions. While this can be highly effective in the short term, especially during periods of high volatility, it means the ETF often returns premium income (or capital) to shareholders rather than growing the underlying NAV. Any negative market movement, such as MSTR underperforming or its positions incurring mark-to-market losses, can accelerate NAV erosion, which in turn may reduce the fund‚Äôs ability to maintain future payouts. In that sense, MSTY‚Äôs distributions are less of a yield from earnings and more of a structured return of capital. Verdict So, yes, MSTY‚Äôs high yield and relatively stable NAV might make compelling selling points, but its prospects are not as rosy as they appear on the surface. We can‚Äôt ignore the fact that any investor who bought at its peak is still up by $16, thanks to its triple-digit yields and despite the deep price downturn. But is this repeatable? And how long would it take for the losses to outpace the returns and eat away at your capital? Remember, in 2021 Bitcoin hit $60,000, then experienced a significant decline and was trading at just above $16,000 by the end of 2022. During the same period, MSTR experienced a price decline of around 70% to 80%. And even though some people might like to think that ‚Äúit's only up from here,‚Äù Bitcoin is notoriously volatile and often goes through multi-year boom-and-bust cycles. If that happens, MSTY‚Äôs synthetic long exposure would place it directly in the line of fire. Deep-in-the-money short puts and collapsing long call values would result in mark-to-market losses and steep NAV erosion. That would likely force the fund to either cut distributions sharply or continue paying out return of capital while its NAV collapses and its ability to recover evaporates. And that‚Äôs my core issue with MSTY - it‚Äôs not built for long-term, multi-year sustainable growth, and it certainly doesn‚Äôt align with my investment preferences. It‚Äôs structured more for income extraction, not capital appreciation, and that income is highly dependent on favorable volatility conditions, which never last forever. That‚Äôs why I can‚Äôt recommend this fund. However, if you do buy the ETF, I‚Äôd suggest keeping your exposure low. That way, when the tide inevitably turns, you don‚Äôt lose a big chunk of your portfolio.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4797205-msty-this-high-risk-high-yield-etf-is-all-smoke-and-mirrors?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","YMAX|TSLY|MSTR|BTC-USD|YBTC|IMST|BTCC|BAGY|BCCC|JEPI|MCSYP|STRF|STRK|MSTY",cryptocompare

2025-06-25T15:10:01,"Genesis DCG Lawsuit: Shocking Allegations Unveiled","BitcoinWorld Genesis DCG Lawsuit: Shocking Allegations Unveiled The crypto world is no stranger to dramatic turns, but few sagas have captured attention quite like the ongoing dispute between bankrupt crypto lender Genesis and its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG). What began as a financial unraveling has escalated into an explosive legal battle, with Genesis now accusing DCG of knowingly enabling its own collapse. This isn‚Äôt just about a company going under; it‚Äôs about a deep dive into alleged corporate negligence and a stark reminder of the interconnectedness within the crypto ecosystem. The Explosive Genesis DCG Lawsuit: Unpacking the Allegations At the heart of the matter lies a newly unsealed complaint, first reported by Cointelegraph, that paints a damning picture of the relationship between Genesis and DCG. Genesis, once a prominent crypto lender, alleges that DCG executives, including CFO Michael Kraines, were not only aware of significant legal risks but also privately discussed worst-case scenarios should Genesis fail. This revelation suggests a level of foresight that clashes sharply with the public narrative of unforeseen market shocks. The core of the Genesis DCG lawsuit revolves around the accusation that DCG deliberately kept Genesis afloat, not to save it, but to allegedly drain its balance sheet and project a false sense of stability to the market. Imagine a lifeline being extended, not for rescue, but for strategic advantage ‚Äì that‚Äôs the chilling claim Genesis is making. This isn‚Äôt merely a dispute over funds; it‚Äôs a profound challenge to the integrity and ethical conduct of a major player in the digital asset space. Did DCG Ignore Dire Financial Warnings Crypto? One of the most critical aspects of Genesis‚Äôs complaint is the assertion that DCG disregarded urgent warnings. External consultants reportedly flagged serious concerns, yet DCG allegedly delayed action, even as Genesis‚Äôs loan book ballooned from $4 billion to a staggering $12 billion. This isn‚Äôt a minor oversight; it points to a systemic disregard for crucial risk management, raising questions about accountability. Internal records cited in the complaint describe Genesis as ‚Äúflying blind‚Äù during this period of rapid expansion. Furthermore, auditors had reportedly flagged serious control failures as early as 2020, years before the eventual collapse. These financial warnings crypto firms receive are meant to be red flags, prompting immediate corrective action. The alleged failure to act on these warnings, despite their severity and longevity, forms a significant part of Genesis‚Äôs case against its parent company. The Anatomy of a Crypto Lender Collapse: Beyond External Shocks While external events like the Terra-Luna crash and the Three Arrows Capital (3AC) implosion certainly contributed to market instability, Genesis‚Äôs complaint suggests internal factors played a far more insidious role in its crypto lender collapse . The lawsuit details a ‚Äútoxic culture‚Äù within Genesis, where staff allegedly faced immense pressure to prioritize DCG‚Äôs interests, even if it meant compromising Genesis‚Äôs own financial health. Consider the aftermath of the 3AC collapse, a pivotal moment that sent shockwaves through the industry. Genesis staff were reportedly given scripted messages, while DCG executives allegedly downplayed the crisis internally. This alleged manipulation of information, if true, highlights a dangerous precedent for transparency and investor confidence in the crypto lending sector. It implies a deliberate strategy to manage perceptions rather than address underlying problems head-on, potentially leaving countless investors exposed. Digital Currency Group Under Fire: What‚Äôs Next for the Empire? The stakes in this legal battle are incredibly high. Genesis is now seeking over $3.3 billion in damages from DCG and its CEO, Barry Silbert. This isn‚Äôt their first skirmish; Genesis previously filed a $1.2 billion lawsuit against DCG in May. The escalating nature of these claims puts immense pressure on Digital Currency Group , a sprawling conglomerate that includes prominent entities like Grayscale, the manager of the world‚Äôs largest Bitcoin trust (GBTC). The outcome of this lawsuit could have far-reaching implications for DCG‚Äôs financial stability, its reputation, and its ability to operate effectively within the highly scrutinized crypto landscape. A multi-billion-dollar judgment against it could force significant restructuring or even divestment of assets, potentially reshaping the institutional crypto market as we know it. This legal saga serves as a stark reminder that even the largest players are not immune to intense scrutiny and accountability. Barry Silbert Allegations: At the Helm of the Storm? Central to Genesis‚Äôs claims are the direct accusations leveled against Barry Silbert, the founder and CEO of Digital Currency Group. As the architect of DCG and a highly influential figure in the crypto space, Silbert‚Äôs alleged involvement in the decisions leading to Genesis‚Äôs downfall places him directly in the crosshairs of this lawsuit. The complaint suggests a disparity between Silbert‚Äôs public persona as a visionary leader and the internal records detailing the alleged mismanagement. The Barry Silbert allegations underscore the challenges of corporate governance in a rapidly evolving industry. When a parent company‚Äôs interests are perceived to override those of its subsidiary, especially to the detriment of its creditors, it raises serious questions about fiduciary duties and ethical leadership. The legal battle will undoubtedly scrutinize his communications, decisions, and the extent of his knowledge regarding Genesis‚Äôs deteriorating financial health. Challenges and Implications for the Crypto Market This lawsuit isn‚Äôt just about two companies; it has broader implications for the entire crypto market. It highlights several key challenges: Loss of Investor Trust: Such high-profile disputes erode confidence, making investors wary of centralized crypto services. Regulatory Scrutiny: Lawsuits of this magnitude inevitably draw the attention of regulators, potentially leading to stricter oversight and new regulations for crypto lending and inter-company dealings. Interconnectedness Risk: The case exposes the dangers of highly interconnected corporate structures within crypto, where the failure of one entity can cascade throughout an entire group. Transparency Deficit: The allegations of downplaying crises and operating ‚Äòblind‚Äô underscore a persistent need for greater transparency in the digital asset industry. Actionable Insights for Crypto Participants While the Genesis-DCG saga unfolds, there are valuable lessons for investors and participants in the crypto space: Due Diligence is Paramount: Before committing funds to any platform, conduct thorough research into its parent company, its financial health, and its history. Look beyond marketing hype. Understand Interdependencies: Be aware of how different entities within a crypto conglomerate are connected. A problem in one division can quickly affect others. Diversify and Decentralize: Don‚Äôt put all your eggs in one centralized basket. Explore decentralized finance (DeFi) options, but understand their risks too. Diversification across different platforms and asset types can mitigate risk. Stay Informed: Follow reputable news sources and official court documents to understand the evolving landscape of crypto regulations and legal challenges. A Lingering Shadow Over Crypto Lending The Genesis-DCG lawsuit serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent risks and complexities within the crypto lending sector. It underscores the importance of robust corporate governance, transparent financial reporting, and ethical leadership. As the legal proceedings unfold, the crypto community will be watching closely, hoping that this painful chapter ultimately leads to a more mature, resilient, and trustworthy industry. The outcome of this unprecedented legal battle will not only determine the fate of Genesis and DCG but will also send a clear message about accountability in the digital asset space, potentially reshaping how crypto businesses operate and interact with their subsidiaries and, most importantly, with their customers.

At this point, while the BTC price rose above $ 108,000, bold statements came from Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino. According to The Block, Tether CEO claimed that the company could become the largest BTC mining company by the end of the year. Tether CEO recently said on the Big Brain podcast that Tether holds more than 100,000 BTC in total, and that the company‚Äôs Bitcoin mining operations play an important role in securing investments. Stating that they made approximately $13 billion in profit from mining in 2024 with their team of less than 200 people, the famous CEO stated that mining is important to secure Bitcoin investments rather than for profit purposes. Ardoino underlined that mining is necessary for Tether's BTC reserves, noting that Tether's Bitcoin mining operations are strategically important in securing the $10 billion Bitcoin investment. ‚ÄúI think if you have $1 million and you have to decide whether to invest it in Bitcoin mining or buying Bitcoin outright, it‚Äôs clear that you‚Äôre always going to make more money buying Bitcoin outright. But in our case, given our exposure to Bitcoin, it's important to be part of the security of the network. Realistically, by the end of this year, Tether will be the largest bitcoin miner in the market.‚Äù Tether, which has also made great strides in Bitcoin mining, has invested more than $2 billion in energy production and mining infrastructure at 15 sites in Uruguay, Paraguay, and El Salvador since 2023. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-25T15:06:59,"Top Cryptos to Watch: These Are Poised for Breakout According to Data","New on-chain data has revealed a widening profit gap across major crypto assets, fueling speculation on which coins are overheated and which are primed for a breakout. According to market intelligence platform Santiment, 94.5% of Bitcoin (BTC) holders are sitting on unrealized gains, with Ethereum (ETH) trailing slightly at 88.7%. On the flip side, less than half of Cardano (ADA) holders are in the green, highlighting deep-seated bearish sentiment and potential undervaluation. Behind the Divide Santiment‚Äôs analysis shows a classic market tension, where coins with the most holders in profit, like BTC, tend to attract investor confidence but also risk triggering sell-offs. This is especially relevant now, given Bitcoin‚Äôs recent climb past $106,000. In the last 24 hours, the king cryptocurrency gained a formidable 2%, and nearly 3.4% over the week, reinforcing its stronghold amid easing geopolitical tensions. Yesterday, on-chain expert Axel Adler Jr. confirmed that about 720,000 BTC were sold over the last two months. Yet, Bitcoin absorbed the pressure rather than crashing, thanks to strong demand from new buyers. The Realized Cap for 0‚Äì1 month holders spiked by $66 billion since April, marking one of the most significant profit-taking waves in recent memory. However, Adler‚Äôs UTXO model now shows a cooldown in selling, suggesting reduced downside risk in the short term. Meanwhile, ADA is spiraling in the opposite direction. Currently trading around $0.60 after a 23.6% slide in the last 30 days, only 46.5% of its holders are in profit, potentially making it attractive for long-term contrarians. While analysts such as Marcus Corvinus see bullish patterns and oversold RSI conditions, significant hurdles remain. Whale sell-offs, including a recent 270 million ADA dump, and persistent negative momentum are challenging such narratives. ETH, DOGE, and XRP Even as Bitcoin basks in broad profitability, major altcoins are painting a fragmented picture. ETH, with 88.7% of holders profitable, faces near-term leverage risks. Earlier in the week, Matrixport warned that crowded futures positioning could threaten further downside, contributing to its 4.2% weekly drop to around $2,430. Looking at XRP, with 65.1% of holders above water, and Dogecoin (DOGE), which has 64.7% of investors sitting pretty, there are still undertones of technical fragility. At the time of this writing, XRP was trading at $2.18, down 7.4% in the last month, while DOGE has been consolidating nervously between $0.16 and $0.18. Market watcher Ali Martinez recently warned that a break either way could trigger a 60% swing. All things considered, Santiment‚Äôs data suggests that coins like Chainlink (LINK), with just under 60% of its owners showing a return, and ADA may have untapped upside if broader sentiment lifts. Key triggers include Bitcoin‚Äôs ability to hold $100,000 support amid profit-taking, Ethereum‚Äôs leverage unwind, and whether the altcoins can convert technical oversold signals into sustained demand.

2025-06-25T15:05:00,"Bitcoin Rebounds To 8-Day-High, But Key Concern Lies In Trading Volume","Summary Bitcoin climbs to an eight-day high near $106,800, but pullback highlights stiff resistance. RSI crosses into bullish territory while price enters the upper half of bearish channel. Volume on Binance weakens amid doubts about the Middle-East cease-fire. By Sholanke Dele The rally, which began earlier this week after a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran, has pushed Bitcoin over 6% higher since Monday. However, the price met stiff resistance exactly at the $106,800 level, which prompted a brief pullback. Despite the minor retracement, Bitcoin is edging higher again in today‚Äôs European session, pointing to renewed bullish interest. Price action suggests that if Bitcoin can break past the $106,800 resistance zone, a retest of the top boundary of the prevailing bearish channel is likely. As of today, that upper trendline is just below the $109,000 mark. BTC price dynamics (April - June 2025). Source: TradingView The broader technical setup offers mixed signals. Since May, Bitcoin has traded within a descending channel, which has acted as a structural bearish formation. The latest rebound from below the $100,000 psychological level has now brought price to the top half of the channel. This shift is being reinforced by a change in the daily relative strength index. The RSI, which had lingered in bearish territory, has now crossed into bullish territory. This transition reflects strengthening upward momentum, increasing the chances of a resistance breakout. Bitcoin sentiment stays neutral amid doubts about ceasefire reliability However, a key concern lies in the trading volume. On Binance, Bitcoin's rally this week has been accompanied by declining volume, which tempers the enthusiasm around the price recovery. The muted participation coincides with the fear and greed index sitting at neutral, suggesting that traders are still evaluating the reliability of the ceasefire, which was reportedly breached at certain points. Despite the violations, the ceasefire message has acted as a stabilizing force in the crypto market. If price fails to clear $106,800, near-term support sits at the 20-day exponential moving average around $105,000. Holding this support could maintain the bullish bias, while a rejection may send Bitcoin back toward the lower channel boundary. Overall, momentum has shifted upward, but a sustained breakout will require confirmation through stronger volume. Bitcoin jumped 5% after the Israel-Iran ceasefire lifted market sentiment .

2025-06-25T15:04:37,"Crypto Market Sees Major Pullback as Top Narratives Suffer Double-Digit Losses","The previous month has delivered a severe dose of reality to the cryptocurrency sector, with major investment stories suffering steep write-downs. There‚Äôs been no place to hide across our sectors, from cutting-edge developments in data availability and decentralized infrastructure to old favorites like AI tokens and memecoins. As per the latest industry statistics, sentiment has taken a sharp turn as investors pull back from speculative positions, and we‚Äôre seeing a resulting selloff that‚Äôs reflected in the performance of our leading narratives. Now, we‚Äôve had volatility in the market before, but what‚Äôs standing out about the last 30 days is just how much has declined and how many different areas of the market have been affected. To us, this looks like a potential shift from risk-on to risk-off. Data Availability and Bitcoin Ecosystem Lead the Decline The narrative surrounding data availability has taken the toughest blows in this latest round of market corrections. Availability of data is a necessary part of the blockchain scalability effort (see Blocksize, Too Many Nodes, Data Availability, and Diversity, Scaling the Stack). Data availability is critical to the performance of rollups (see more on those in the Multicoin presentation linked above). Rollups are a way of scaling blockchains that holds great promise. Thanks to them, the development of decentralized applications might at last be able to overcome the scalability problem. In losses close behind is the Bitcoin ecosystem. Previously, the ecosystem had benefited from revitalized enthusiasm about protocols based on Bitcoin, ordinals, and Layer 2 solutions. But as the price of Bitcoin became increasingly volatile and downward market momentum set in, even innovations surrounding Bitcoin were no longer attracting investment. Another large sector that took a big hit was the decentralized physical infrastructure networks. Projects in this sector, which were started earlier in the year, seemed well on their way to building real networked hardware across the world, all coordinated with blockchain technology. But with a dwindling risk appetite, the long-term vision of these projects appears to be losing favor with short-term thinkers. AI, Memecoins, and Gaming Fail to Hold Investor Interest Not even the most talked-about sectors in the market have been able to escape this downturn. Artificial intelligence tokens‚Äîa breakout story in early 2024‚Äîhave also seen pullbacks, as the initial hype began to lose steam and investors likely began to scrutinize whether token-based AI projects could really deliver tangible results at scale. GROWTH RATE OF TOP NARRATIVES IN THE PAST 30 DAYS The market is undergoing a sharp correction as all major narratives have recorded significant declines over the past month: Data Availability took the hardest hit with a drop of -38.6% The #Bitcoin Ecosystem (-31.8%) and‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/aulRaJNIjE ‚Äî Followin (@followin_io) June 24, 2025 Memecoins, which are often thought of as the purest expression of crypto‚Äôs speculative spirit, saw steep losses, too. The attraction of fast profits and viral community movements has cooled a lot in recent weeks, as we‚Äôre under the draw of rising regulatory scrutiny and a broader market uncertainty that has many retail investors backing away. The story and the told story in gaming are seen as bridges that can carry blockchain technology to the mass audience. Apart from GameFi‚Äôs building and evolving, is it fair to say that investor confidence is somewhat shaky at the moment? If so, do you think it might be because we‚Äôre still waiting for big, shiny products to materialize? Store of Value Holds Strong Amid Market Weakness While almost all sectors experienced large losses, one narrative stood out as the most resilient: store of value. Often linked with assets like Bitcoin and various stable, performing tokens, this realm saw only a mild decline. That relatively gentle drop suggests that, in these turbulent times, some investors are retreating to safer, more established holdings, rather than making a full exit from the market. Store of value assets perform much better than we had expected, underscoring the original crypto use case of preserving wealth in a digital world. In times of volatility, when the macroeconomic outlook is in doubt, perceived stable assets tend to outperform high-risk, high-reward plays. Outlook: From Hype Cycles to Fundamental Repricing A potential transition may be afoot in the crypto market, establishing this previously largely unregulated space more firmly within the realm of legitimate capital markets. That is, in a fundamental-sense way, like a real market, a regulated market. As the market consolidates, attention will focus on project teams to produce genuine usefulness, scalability, and real user adoption in the world. Meanwhile, cautious investors are likely to prioritize risk management over project management. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

2025-06-25T15:02:51,"Tether hints at competing with corporate miners","Tether‚Äôs CEO, Paolo Ardoino, said the company could become a leading BTC miner in 2025, branching out to boost network security. The statement came after Tether disclosed holdings of 100K BTC, making it one of the most significant whales with long-term reserves. Tether may become one of the leading miners after taking up the role of securing the network, said the company‚Äôs CEO, Paolo Ardoino, during the Big Brain podcast . While Tether has been a part of the crypto ecosystem in multiple ways, there have been no explicit mentions of building actual mining infrastructure. ‚ÄòI think that it is clear that if you have $1 million and you have to decide where to put it, either in bitcoin mining or in buying bitcoin directly, you would always make more money buying bitcoin directly,‚Äô said Ardoino. ‚Äò But in our case, I think given the exposure that we have to Bitcoin, it‚Äôs important to be part of the security of the network. Realistically, by the end of this year, Tether will become the biggest bitcoin miner out there. ‚Äô Tether has not disclosed its current hashrate, though it has made known investments into energy infrastructure in Uruguay, Paraguay, and El Salvador. Tether supports multiple elements in the local energy infrastructure, while also owning undisclosed shares in third-party mining companies. Tether hints at competing with corporate miners Tether may expand its mining influence at a time when the Bitcoin network is working at a record hashrate, and remains profitable for most participants. The Bitcoin network hashrate recently fell to a six-month low, sinking back to around 700 EH/s. This would translate into a lower network difficulty and easier competition for miners. The easier mining arrives at a time when BTC managed to recover above $107,000, making block production still profitable for most pools. The Bitcoin hashrate fell from its recent peak, making the network more accessible to miners. | Source: Bitbo There are a few remaining miners with solo operations, as even big data centers often add their hashrate to pools. Some of the biggest operations include Mara Holdings, CleanSpark, IREN, Core Scientific, and others. Tether itself has not reported the exact hashrate or share of mining operations. Unlike corporate miners, Tether has also not positioned itself as a BTC treasury company, despite its vast holdings accrued over the years. Tether also denied rumors of going public or tying its stock price to BTC holdings. Earlier this year, Tether shared that it intends to set aside another $500M for mining activity. Tether also stated it would point most of its mining capacity at Ocean Pool , a relatively small operation with 9.61 EH/s. So far, Tether has only contributed a part of the pool‚Äôs hashrate, and there are no signs the company holds enough capacity to surpass giant operations like Mara Holdings with over 57 EH/s. Tether‚Äôs known wallets also rarely show BTC inflows, especially those identifiable as originating with mining pools. Ocean Pool aims to offer zero-fee access, as well as direct decentralized payments for all participants. If Tether is indeed serious about becoming a leading miner, the pool‚Äôs hashrate may reflect the expansion.

2025-06-25T15:00:57,"Dogecoin Price Closes Daily Candle With A Doji, What This Means","The Dogecoin price is in focus, having closed the daily candle with a Doji. Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade commented on this development and revealed what it could mean for the foremost meme coin. What‚Äôs Next For Dogecoin Price Following Doji Daily Close In an X post, Trader Tardigrade highlighted the fact that the Dogecoin price daily candle closed with a Doji. He remarked that a new sign of a breakout has emerged following a Doji at the end of a downtrend. The analyst noted that this indicates a high possibility of a trend reversal from downtrend to uptrend. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Enters Historical Bounce Zone, But Will This Time Be Different? The Dogecoin price has witnessed a massive decline over the last month, down over 27% during this period, according to CoinMarketCap data. DOGE has dropped way below the psychological $0.2 price level, providing a bearish outlook for the meme coin. However, Trader Tardigrade‚Äôs analysis suggested that the meme coin could soon record another massive rally to the upside. The analyst‚Äôs accompanying chart showed that the Dogecoin price could reclaim the $0.2 level on this projected trend reversal to the upside. Fundamentals also support a DOGE rally, seeing as tensions in the Middle East have cooled off, with Israel and Iran agreeing to a ceasefire. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin price has again rallied and reclaimed the $106,000 level. This is bullish for the meme coin given its correlation with the flagship crypto. In another X post, Trader Tardigrade provided a bullish outlook for the Dogecoin price, stating that DOGE season could be approaching soon. He revealed that the DOGE/BTC pair has experienced the last shakeout, signaling the start of the meme coin‚Äôs season. His accompanying chart showed that Dogecoin could rally above $2 once this DOGE season begins. Key Levels To Watch For DOGE In a YouTube video, crypto analyst Kevin Capital highlighted the range between $0.12 and $0.142 as the key level to watch for the Dogecoin price. The analyst also alluded to DOGE‚Äôs weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI), stating that the meme coin cannot afford to drop below 38. He claimed that a drop could lead to the meme coin falling into a bear market structure. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Crash Below $0.2: 4H Order Block Shows Exactly What‚Äôs Happening Kevin Capital then highlighted the DOGE/BTC pair, noting that the meme coin is at a critical level that it needs to hold above if it is to outperform Bitcoin later in the year. The analyst expects the meme coin to make a significant run and outperform the flagship crypto when the Fed begins to ease monetary policies. The analyst remarked that a positive for DOGE is that there are bullish indicators flashing for the meme coin on the daily timeframe. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.16, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.
