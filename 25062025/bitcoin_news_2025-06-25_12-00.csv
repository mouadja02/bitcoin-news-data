2025-06-25T09:52:32,"Fuzzland Blames Ex-Employee for $2M Bedrock UniBTC Exploit Using Insider Malware","Ex-Fuzzland Staff Member Responsible for $2M Bedrock UniBTC Exploit Smart contract analysis platform Fuzzland has uncovered that a former staff member was behind a $2 million exploit on Bedrock’s UniBTC protocol in September 2024. In a transparency report , the attacker abused insider information, malware, and advanced persistent threat (APT) tactics to bypass sensitive internal systems and information. Malware and Social Engineering Facilitated Attack Fuzzland reported that the hacker employed social engineering, supply chain compromise, and malware to infiltrate its systems. The UniBTC vulnerability was first identified internally during an emergency call and then exploited. The attacker had installed backdoors on engineering workstations that granted long-term undiscovered access. It enabled them to access a vulnerability first unveiled in a report from security firm Dedaub. Even though the flaw was detected before, Fuzzland admitted that it was receiving lesser priority since it was producing so many false positive alerts. Compensation and Ongoing Investigations Fuzzland guaranteed that it had completely compensated Bedrock for losing $2 million and is working together with ZeroShadow in pursuing the breach. Reports have also been lodged with the FBI and Chinese government. In response to the exploit, Fuzzland teamed up with cybersecurity firms Seal 911 and SlowMist to heighten security levels across the DeFi ecosystem. The company emphasized that no customer or client data was hacked and that the attack was isolated in an alternate internal environment. Bedrock Recovers Despite the Attack Bedrock, a liquid restaking protocol that offers synthetic assets like UniBTC, UniETH, and UniIOTX, confirmed the exploit on Sept. 27, 2024. Despite losing $2 million on its decentralized exchange pools, the protocol’s total value locked (TVL) went up from $240 million in September 2024 to $535 million as of June 2025, according to DefiLlama. Rising Social Engineering Attacks Fuzzland’s reveal follows wider trends within the crypto security sector. Blockchain security company CertiK said that $2.1 billion has so far been lost to crypto attacks in 2025, with an increasing proportion attributed to phishing and wallet exploits. CertiK co-founder Ronghui Gu said that attackers are increasingly moving away from smart contract bugs towards human-focused attacks, including social engineering and insider manipulation.",btcpulse,https://btc-pulse.com/fuzzland-blames-ex-employee-for-2m-bedrock-unibtc/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|APT","Blockchain|Sticky|Bitcoin|Regulation",cryptocompare

2025-06-25T09:40:01,"US Treasury Secretary: Unlocking Pivotal Trade Deals Post-July 4 Tax Bill","BitcoinWorld US Treasury Secretary: Unlocking Pivotal Trade Deals Post-July 4 Tax Bill The economic landscape is often shaped by strategic announcements from key figures, and the recent statement from US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has certainly captured the attention of analysts, investors, and the general public alike. Bessent’s declaration that the United States is poised to finalize significant Trade Deals immediately following the passage of a critical Tax Bill after July 4th marks a potentially transformative moment for the nation’s economic future. This pivotal timeline suggests a carefully orchestrated plan to leverage domestic fiscal reforms into a stronger global trade position, potentially sending ripples across various sectors, including the ever-evolving Financial Markets . What’s Driving the US Treasury Secretary’s Optimism? Scott Bessent’s comments underscore a strategic alignment between fiscal policy and international trade ambitions. The idea that major trade negotiations hinge on the successful enactment of a new tax bill before a specific date, July 4th, is more than just a procedural detail; it’s a testament to the administration’s integrated approach to Economic Policy . Historically, tax reforms have been utilized to stimulate domestic growth, encourage investment, and enhance a nation’s competitive edge on the global stage. By linking the finalization of trade deals to the tax bill’s passage, the administration appears to be signaling that a stable and favorable domestic tax environment is a prerequisite for robust international commerce. This approach aims to provide greater certainty for businesses operating within the U.S. and those looking to invest. A predictable tax structure can lower operational costs, encourage repatriation of profits, and make U.S. goods and services more attractive globally. This foundation, the thinking goes, empowers U.S. negotiators with stronger leverage in discussions with international partners, making the prospect of favorable Trade Deals more achievable. Decoding the Significance of Upcoming Trade Deals The phrase ‘ Trade Deals ‘ often conjures images of complex negotiations and dense legal texts, but their impact on everyday life is profound. These agreements dictate the terms under which goods and services cross international borders, influencing everything from the price of consumer goods to the competitiveness of domestic industries. For the U.S., new trade agreements could mean: Expanded Market Access: Opening new avenues for American products and services in foreign markets, potentially boosting exports and creating jobs. Reduced Tariffs and Barriers: Lowering costs for both importers and exporters, which can translate to more affordable goods for consumers and increased profitability for businesses. Enhanced Economic Growth: Facilitating smoother international commerce can stimulate overall economic activity, contributing to GDP growth. Strengthened Geopolitical Alliances: Trade agreements often go hand-in-hand with diplomatic relations, solidifying partnerships and promoting stability. The specific nature of these deals remains to be seen, but the emphasis from the US Treasury Secretary suggests a focus on agreements that align with the nation’s strategic economic interests, aiming to foster fair and reciprocal trade relationships. Why is the Tax Bill Passage So Crucial for Trade? The upcoming Tax Bill , slated for passage around July 4th, is not merely a domestic fiscal adjustment; it is positioned as a cornerstone for future international economic engagement. A significant tax overhaul can: Boost Domestic Investment: By offering incentives or reducing corporate tax burdens, the bill could encourage companies to invest more within the U.S., leading to job creation and innovation. Improve Competitiveness: A favorable tax regime can make the U.S. a more attractive location for businesses, drawing in foreign direct investment and making American companies more competitive globally. Provide Negotiating Leverage: A strong domestic economy, bolstered by a supportive tax structure, gives the US Treasury Secretary and other negotiators a stronger hand at the bargaining table for Trade Deals . It signals economic stability and a clear direction for growth. The exact provisions of this tax bill will be critical in determining its impact, but the administration’s messaging clearly links its passage to the subsequent acceleration of trade deal finalization. This strategic timing highlights the interconnectedness of internal fiscal health and external trade prowess within comprehensive Economic Policy . Navigating the Complexities of US Economic Policy The orchestration of a major Tax Bill and subsequent Trade Deals is a testament to the intricate nature of modern Economic Policy . The US Treasury Secretary plays a central role in this grand economic strategy, advising the President on economic and financial issues, implementing tax policy, and participating in international financial diplomacy. Crafting policies that simultaneously stimulate domestic growth, manage inflation, and foster beneficial international relationships is a delicate balancing act. Consider the potential challenges: Aspect Potential Benefit Potential Challenge Tax Bill Passage Increased investment, job creation, improved competitiveness. Public opposition, budget deficits, unequal distribution of benefits. Trade Deal Finalization Domestic industry displacement, geopolitical tensions, complex enforcement. Expanded markets, lower costs, stronger alliances. Overall Economic Stability Predictable growth, investor confidence. Unforeseen global events, inflationary pressures, market volatility. The success of these initiatives will depend not only on their design but also on effective communication and adaptability in response to dynamic global conditions. The synergy between fiscal and trade strategies is key to unlocking the intended economic benefits. What Could This Mean for Financial Markets? The announcement from the US Treasury Secretary about impending Trade Deals and the foundational Tax Bill is already being scrutinized by participants in Financial Markets . Markets thrive on certainty and growth prospects, and this dual-pronged approach could signal a period of significant activity. Here’s how different segments might react: Equity Markets: Companies poised to benefit from expanded trade access or reduced tax burdens could see their valuations rise. Sectors like manufacturing, agriculture, and technology, often heavily involved in international trade, might experience particular uplift. Bond Markets: The implications for government bonds will depend on how the tax bill affects national debt and inflation expectations. If the policies lead to stronger economic growth, it could influence interest rate forecasts. Currency Markets: A more competitive U.S. economy and increased trade could strengthen the U.S. dollar, impacting global exchange rates. Cryptocurrency Markets: While often seen as an alternative asset class, cryptocurrencies are not entirely decoupled from traditional financial systems. Increased stability and growth in the broader economy, driven by effective Economic Policy , could foster greater institutional adoption and regulatory clarity, potentially leading to increased capital inflows into digital assets. Conversely, a strong dollar might make dollar-denominated crypto investments less attractive to international investors in the short term. Investors will be closely watching for the specifics of the tax bill and the details of the trade deals to make informed decisions. The period immediately following July 4th could be characterized by heightened volatility as markets digest these significant policy shifts. Benefits and Challenges on the Horizon for US Trade and Economy As the U.S. prepares for these significant shifts in its Economic Policy , it’s essential to weigh both the potential upsides and the inherent challenges. The vision articulated by the US Treasury Secretary is one of renewed economic vigor and global leadership, yet the path forward is rarely without obstacles. Potential Benefits: Economic Revitalization: A combination of tax incentives and new market access can inject fresh capital into the economy, spurring innovation and expansion across various industries. Job Growth: Expanded trade opportunities often translate into increased demand for labor in sectors involved in exports and international commerce. Increased Competitiveness: Streamlined trade processes and a favorable tax environment can make American businesses more competitive globally, attracting talent and investment. Consumer Savings: Reduced tariffs and more efficient supply chains can lead to lower prices for imported goods, benefiting consumers. Inherent Challenges: Negotiation Hurdles: Finalizing complex Trade Deals with multiple partners can be protracted and fraught with disagreements over specific terms and conditions. Domestic Impact: While beneficial overall, certain domestic industries might face increased competition from imports, requiring adaptation or support. Global Economic Volatility: Unforeseen global events, such as geopolitical conflicts or supply chain disruptions, could impact the effectiveness of these policies. Political Opposition: Both the Tax Bill and new trade agreements could face significant political resistance, potentially delaying or altering their implementation. Successfully navigating these challenges will require adept leadership from the US Treasury Secretary and a collaborative approach across government branches and international partners. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Post-July 4 Landscape For businesses, investors, and individuals, understanding the implications of these forthcoming changes is paramount. The period after July 4th is set to be dynamic, with potential shifts in regulations, market conditions, and international relations. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed on Policy Details: Closely monitor the specifics of the passing Tax Bill and the emerging details of the new Trade Deals . The fine print will determine the precise impact on various sectors. Assess Sector-Specific Impacts: Evaluate how your industry or investments might be uniquely affected. Are you in an export-heavy sector? Do you rely on imported components? Understanding these nuances is key. Diversify and Adapt: In times of policy shifts, diversification can mitigate risk. For businesses, this might mean exploring new markets or supply chain strategies. For investors, it means maintaining a balanced portfolio that accounts for potential market volatility. Engage with Policy Discussions: Businesses and industry groups should consider engaging with policymakers to voice concerns or offer insights as these policies are finalized and implemented. Monitor Financial Markets Closely: Pay attention to how traditional assets and cryptocurrencies react to the news. Market sentiment can be a leading indicator of perceived economic health. The proactive approach outlined by the US Treasury Secretary demands an equally proactive response from all stakeholders to capitalize on opportunities and mitigate risks. A New Chapter for US Economic Policy The statements from US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent regarding the finalization of Trade Deals post-July 4th, contingent on the passage of a critical Tax Bill , signal a decisive new chapter in U.S. Economic Policy . This integrated strategy aims to bolster domestic strength through fiscal reform, thereby empowering the nation to forge more advantageous international agreements. The anticipated impact on Financial Markets , from traditional equities to the burgeoning cryptocurrency space, underscores the far-reaching implications of these policy decisions. While challenges undoubtedly lie ahead, the strategic timing and explicit linkage of these initiatives suggest a clear vision for enhancing America’s economic competitiveness and global standing. The coming months will reveal the full scope of these transformative efforts, shaping the economic narrative for years to come.

2025-06-25T09:25:39,"Bitcoin Rainbow Chart predicts BTC price for July 1, 2025","With Bitcoin ( BTC ) on track to end June above the $100,000 mark, the Rainbow Chart is projecting that the asset will likely sustain this level heading into July. This outlook follows a resurgence in bullish momentum as geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran appear to have eased. Earlier, Bitcoin faced the threat of dropping further below $100,000 after the United States launched an attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities. The cooling of hostilities has since helped stabilize investor sentiment. Bitcoin price prediction for July 1 The Rainbow Chart, which is based on a logarithmic regression model, visually maps Bitcoin’s price into color-coded bands. These bands represent different phases of market sentiment, ranging from extreme fear to speculative euphoria. As of today, Bitcoin is trading at around $106,000, placing it just above the “BUY!” zone and slightly below the “Accumulate” band. This suggests that, in the context of historical trends, the asset is still undervalued and remains in a favorable zone for long-term investors looking to build or expand their positions. Bitcoin Rainbow Chart price prediction for July 1. Source: Coinglass According to the chart’s forecast, Bitcoin would fall into “Fire sale!” territory if it dropped below $69,763 on July 1. Prices between that level and $94,821 are labeled “BUY!,” indicating historically undervalued conditions. The range from $94,821 to $130,171 marks the “Accumulate” zone, where investors are encouraged to build positions. Above this lies a progression of bands, from “Still cheap” and “HOLD,” to more speculative territory like “Is this a bubble?”, “FOMO intensifies,” “Sell. Seriously, sell!” and finally, “Maximum bubble territory,” which begins at $602,453 and stretches to $819,513. Given current levels and assuming relative price stability or a slight upside, Bitcoin appears poised to remain within the “BUY!” and “Accumulate” ranges heading into July. Bitcoin price analysis At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $106,461, having gained over 1% in the past 24 hours. On the weekly chart, it has posted modest gains of 0.4%.

2025-06-25T09:23:49,"Bitcoin could soon surge to $120K after it regained this crucial level: CryptoQuant","Bitcoin is showing signs of renewed strength after reclaiming a key technical level that historically marks the start of short-term rallies. According to a June 25 analysis by CryptoQuant contributor İbrahim COŞAR, Bitcoin ( BTC ) has successfully moved back above its 50-day exponential moving average, a trend line often used to identify major shifts in market momentum. In the past, Bitcoin’s price often increased by 10% to 20% when it dropped below the 50-day EMA during a correction and then swiftly rose above it again. It appears that the pattern is reoccurring. Bitcoin has now closed three days in a row above the 50-day EMA after momentarily falling below it, indicating that bulls may be regaining control. COŞAR believes this could pave the way for a move toward $120,000 in the short term, though he warns that geopolitical events involving the United States, Israel, and Iran, could bring about unexpected volatility. You might also like: BTC crash was no accident: Bitcoin’s price chart warned of potential weakness At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $106,720, up 1.4% in the past 24 hours. This represents a 7.8% recovery from its June 22 low of $98,974 when the market sold off in response to escalating Middle East tensions. Some analysts believe that geopolitical unrest may strengthen Bitcoin’s long-term appeal as a hedge. War and inflation risks often lead to increased government spending and easing of monetary policy, conditions that tend to favor Bitcoin. Despite the conflict, investor interest in Bitcoin has remained strong. For the eleventh day in a row, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have seen consistent inflows. According to SoSoValue data , total net inflows in the past week have reached $938 million, showing continued interest from investors. On the technical side, Bitcoin is approaching the upper band around $110,100 after breaking above the 50-day EMA. If Bitcoin is able to consolidate above the $105,700–$106,000 range, this setup would point to growing bullish momentum. Bitcoin price analysis. Credit: crypto.news At 54.69, the relative strength index is just above neutral and indicates improving momentum without yet being overbought. Shorter-term moving averages also flash “buy,” and the moving average convergence divergence has entered a bullish signal zone. Bulls must push Bitcoin above the $108,000–$110,000 resistance level for upside momentum to continue. A daily close above $110,000 could open the door to the $114,000–$120,000 range. If momentum fades, support lies at $105,000 and stronger buying could return near $102,000 or $98,900.

2025-06-25T09:17:02,"Best Crypto to Buy Now As US To Accept Bitcoin In Mortgage Applications","This year alone has seen crypto adoption in the U.S. rise faster than most analysts expected. What began as cautious accumulation is now unfolding into real structural interest from both corporations and public entities. But the real scope of its growth lies not just in trading or payments, but in how crypto gets woven into the financial ecosystem. And when that happens, the demand for digital assets doesn’t just rise, it accelerates exponentially. That kind of acceleration may now be closer than anticipated. In a recent and quietly monumental move, the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) confirmed that it is actively exploring the possibility of counting crypto holdings as part of mortgage qualification criteria. If successful, this development could place Bitcoin and other leading cryptocurrencies right alongside stocks, bonds, and savings as proof of financial capability for borrowers looking to secure home loans. Bitcoin as a Mortgage Asset? U.S. Housing Authority Opens Strategic Review The body responsible for regulating America’s housing finance ecosystem, the FHFA, has just added crypto to its radar in a serious way. According to Director Bill Pulte, the agency is reviewing whether digital asset holdings, specifically Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies, can be considered legitimate assets when evaluating mortgage applicants. Currently, agencies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac use strict formulas to assess borrower wealth and creditworthiness. Assets must be liquid, traceable, and held in regulated institutions. Cryptocurrency, while growing in popularity, has not traditionally qualified under these terms. That may now be changing. We will study the usage pf cryptocurrency holdings as it relates to qualifying for mortgages. — Pulte (@pulte) June 24, 2025 Pulte stated that the FHFA is working on a strategic plan to examine how these assets could be folded into the broader underwriting process. This would involve studying crypto balances as a component of wealth verification, particularly for loan programs backed by the 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks, as well as Fannie and Freddie. In practice, this could look very similar to how stock portfolios or mutual fund holdings are currently handled. For example, if a borrower shows $200,000 in a traditional investment account, that’s typically enough to boost confidence in their ability to repay. Now, imagine the same being said of a wallet holding an equivalent amount in Bitcoin or Solana, especially when these holdings are parked with regulated custodians. The principle remains the same: asset strength supports borrowing power. Should this review lead to formal recognition of digital holdings, it would mark a first for a government mortgage institution and signal that crypto has earned a seat at the table in one of the largest asset-backed markets in the world, worth over $18 trillion. Best Crypto to Buy Now SUBBD SUBBD is a decentralized protocol built by those who truly understand the creator economy, for creators. What sets it apart is its refusal to treat content as disposable or creators as interchangeable. Instead, SUBBD offers a structure where creators not only own their output but actively shape the economics that drive its value. It boasts a model that allows creators to issue personalized channels tied to tokenized support. Fans can subscribe to these channels using SUBBD tokens, granting them access to gated content, early drops, private discussions, and even voting power over what gets produced next. The result is a kind of monetized intimacy where engagement carries real economic weight. What makes SUBBD increasingly relevant is the shift happening across digital culture. Audiences are moving away from ad-saturated platforms and toward ecosystems where their interaction is meaningful. SUBBD lets creators build those ecosystems with financial and social mechanics that function outside of traditional Web2 algorithms. The project was already picked up and endorsed by popular crypto YouTubers like ClayBro and many others, adding to the trust factor. As crypto begins touching sectors like housing and institutional finance, creator-focused tokens may seem like outliers. But in truth, platforms like SUBBD answer the deeper question of utility. They prove that tokens can underpin genuine economic ecosystems built around influence, creativity, and trust. And that is exactly the kind of usage that gives tokens staying power in a world moving toward real-world integration. Best Wallet Token The Best Wallet token is not built for speculation. It is built to empower the most essential part of any crypto journey, which is the wallet. As the native token of the Best Wallet ecosystem, it acts as the connective tissue between storage, action, and rewards, giving users a reason to stay within one trusted interface for everything they need. Unlike wallets that function as static safes, Best Wallet was designed to be dynamic. With the Best Wallet token at its core, users can earn cashback on swaps, reduce fees on cross-chain transfers, and unlock access to ecosystem-specific staking pools. In many ways, the token upgrades the wallet from a passive storage layer into a personalized control panel. Its strength lies in integration. The token is tied to wallet features like in-app bridging, one-tap staking, NFT portfolio management, and curated dApp discovery. These tools are designed to work together, and owning the token ensures users get priority, discounts, or added functionality across each layer. This deep, native utility ensures that the token is not just a payment tool, but an access key. With conversations now surfacing about crypto’s role in more traditional sectors like mortgage qualification, wallet ecosystems will face new expectations. They will need to demonstrate stability, traceability, and consistent use. The Best Wallet token stands out as one that can meet those benchmarks without diluting the freedom that brought users into crypto in the first place. Snorter Snorter has been smartly created to chase what goes viral. While most meme coins rely on hype and holder memes to survive, Snorter took a more technical route. It is a Solana-based sentiment robot trained to detect early-stage meme momentum across social media and trading platforms, then act on it autonomously. The project is essentially a real-time strategy bot layered with meme-trading logic. It listens to pulse shifts from places like Telegram, Twitter, and niche DEX data, scanning for coin names, volume spikes, and behavioral patterns that typically precede a meme pump. When a pattern emerges, Snorter’s contracts respond with allocation and rotation, taking positions in tokens before their visibility hits the average trader’s feed. The beauty of Snorter lies in its autonomous volatility surfacing. It captures the kind of microtrends that never show up in charts until it’s too late. That functionality makes it more than a joke, especially as investors begin to treat crypto portfolios with a blend of serious and speculative exposure. Currently in its presale stage, the project could well be on its way to a launch in the next few weeks, which could be when the price soars to achieve 20x gains or more, as its community speculates. In a world where digital assets might soon be evaluated for things like mortgage qualification, there will still be demand for tools that trade the irrational side of the market. Snorter understands the joke, profits from it, and builds a real-time engine around a genre that refuses to follow rules. As meme volatility becomes its own niche, Snorter may be one of the first protocols to tame it without killing its charm. Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper is doing what every Bitcoin L2 before it only promised. It is not trying to replace Bitcoin or alter its consensus, but it is building around it and making BTC actually usable in modern on-chain environments. At the heart of Bitcoin Hyper is its trustless bridge system. BTC is sent from the main chain, validated through header and proof verification, and then minted as wrapped BTC on the Hyper chain. This Hyper chain is built on Solana’s virtual machine, giving it near-instant finality, a massive transaction ceiling, and costs so low they may as well not exist. What this unlocks is real. Users can now trade, swap, mint tokens, and interact with DeFi protocols using Bitcoin-backed assets, while still having settlement security grounded in proof-of-work. It is the kind of dual benefit that makes Hyper not just a Layer 2, but a Layer 2 that finally feels native. That shift is timely. If Bitcoin is going to be seen as a real qualifying asset in formal systems like housing finance, it cannot just sit idle in a wallet. It needs function. With Hyper, Bitcoin holders are not just storing value: they are putting it to work, staking it, leveraging it, and building on it. Bitcoin Hyper does not try to compete with Ethereum or Solana. It simply gives Bitcoin the tools those chains already have without changing its DNA. That balance of preservation and expansion is what makes it a quiet, serious contender for the future of Bitcoin itself. Conclusion With the U.S. housing finance authority actively reviewing how digital assets like Bitcoin could qualify as part of a mortgage application, the conversation is no longer about potential. It is about readiness. For crypto to play a role in the real economy, it needs more than price charts and hype cycles. It needs infrastructure, purpose, and integration. What once seemed like a walled-off ecosystem is now being looked at by regulators, financial bodies, and real-world institutions as something worth incorporating. That alone should change how we think about where value will flow next, and which protocols are likely to benefit when it does.

2025-06-25T09:15:44,"Billionaire Ray Dalio Gives the US Three Years ‘Give or Take’ Before Serious ‘Economic Heart Attack’","The co-chief investment officer of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, Ray Dalio, is issuing a warning on the US amid the ballooning national debt. In a new Fox Business interview, Dalio says the US will face an economic catastrophe in a few years unless steps are taken to reduce the national debt, which is now hovering above $36 trillion. “If you don’t do that [enforce the debt-reduction measures], and we probably will not do that, it is like the plaque building in the heart. And so we are now not going to have not only more debt and more debt service encroaching on our spending, but it’s also going to mean that we are going to have a supply-demand problem. And this is a heart attack, like an economic heart attack. I would guess it’s about three years, give or take…” According to Dalio, the US has previously managed to successfully extricate itself from a fiscal situation like the one it is currently in, but to do so again would require sacrifices from everyone. “We are at a juncture right now that if we can, soon, very soon, while the economy is still good, cut the deficit to 3% of GDP. Which is possible… you only have to change a couple of things by… change spending by 4%, change tax income by 4%. Then you have a lower interest rate as a result. This is possible. It was done between 1991 and 1998, that balance. Everybody gives a little bit.

2025-06-25T09:14:02,"Bitcoin Pepe price outlook as analyst sees 91% chance for Strategy to enter S&P 500","Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy (MSTR), which trades under the name Strategy, could be on the verge of joining the S&P 500, according to financial analyst Jeff Walton. However, its inclusion is contingent on Bitcoin’s price remaining relatively stable through the end of the second quarter. As Bitcoin’s influence in the equity market grows with more companies buying the crypto, early-stage projects such as Bitcoin Pepe are poised to benefit from the increasing optimism surrounding cryptocurrency markets. 91% chance for S&P 500 inclusion In a video released Tuesday, Walton stated, “I believe there is about a 91% chance of MSTR qualifying for the S&P 500 in Q2″. Walton added that the primary requirement for the addition would be Bitcoin not falling more than 10% before June 30, the end of the first quarter. Bitcoin is currently trading around $106,390. For inclusion in the S&P 500, a company must report positive cumulative earnings over the previous four quarters. MicroStrategy, which holds 592,345 BTC, the largest Bitcoin holding among public companies, has posted net losses for the past three quarters. Walton explained that Bitcoin must stay above $95,240 for the company’s Q2 earnings to outweigh the combined losses from the previous three quarters. A dip below that threshold could disqualify it from meeting the S&P’s earnings requirement. Walton backed his forecast with historical Bitcoin price trends. Since September 17, 2014, there have been 3,928 rolling six-day periods. In 343 of those, Bitcoin’s price dropped more than 10%. In the remaining 3,585 times, the decline was less than 10%. As the end of the quarter nears, the chances of a steep drop continue to decline. Walton estimated a 92.4% probability that Bitcoin won’t fall by 10% over five days, increasing to 97.6% over just one day. Despite the strong statistical odds, recent geopolitical events have caused volatility. Over the weekend, rising tensions between Iran and Israel pushed Bitcoin below $100,000 for the first time since early May. If Bitcoin maintains its current level, MicroStrategy would become the second crypto-linked firm to enter the S&P 500 this year. Coinbase joined the index in May, a move crypto industry leaders called a milestone for broader acceptance. MicroStrategy is already a member of the Nasdaq-100 Index , having been added in December 2024. The S&P 500, however, tracks the 500 largest U.S. publicly traded companies and carries significant institutional weight. Bitcoin Pepe attracts interest Bitcoin Pepe is emerging as a significant presence in the cryptocurrency space, combining meme-themed branding with a strong emphasis on utility and infrastructure development. In contrast to typical meme tokens that rely heavily on social media momentum, Bitcoin Pepe is following a structured technical roadmap. This strategic approach appears to be drawing attention from investors, with the project raising over $15.5 million during its ongoing presale. The team behind Bitcoin Pepe has confirmed that its native token, BPEP, will be listed on the cryptocurrency exchanges MEXC and BitMart. These upcoming listings are expected to enhance the token’s market visibility, increase trading liquidity, and bolster its credibility ahead of a broader market debut. The team is scheduled to make an official listing announcement on June 30. Meanwhile, the team is also working to secure additional partnerships with centralised exchanges (CEXs) to support the wider rollout of BPEP. To incentivise early adopters, existing BPEP token holders will receive a 30% bonus on their current holdings.

2025-06-25T09:10:45,"AI Emotional Intelligence: Unleashing Profound Progress in Language Models","BitcoinWorld AI Emotional Intelligence: Unleashing Profound Progress in Language Models In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, a fascinating and perhaps unexpected shift is taking place. For years, the measure of AI progress was predominantly defined by its prowess in logical reasoning, data processing, and analytical problem-solving. These were the ‘left-brain’ skills that dominated benchmarks and drove innovation. However, a quiet yet powerful revolution is underway, pushing AI companies to prioritize something far more nuanced: AI emotional intelligence . This pivotal move signifies a new era where the ability of machines to understand, interpret, and even respond to human emotions is becoming as crucial as their raw computational power. For those immersed in the world of cryptocurrencies and cutting-edge technology, this development is particularly compelling, as emotionally intelligent AI could reshape user interfaces, digital assistants, and even the very fabric of online interaction, impacting everything from customer service to mental wellness applications. The Revolutionary Shift Towards AI Emotional Intelligence Traditionally, AI’s milestones were marked by achievements in areas like complex calculations, strategic game-playing, or vast information retrieval. Think of chess-playing computers or powerful search engines. These systems excelled at ‘hard’ analytical skills. Yet, as foundation models grow in complexity and interact more directly with human users, the focus is increasingly shifting towards ‘soft’ measures. User preference, the intuitive ‘feel’ of interacting with an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and the overall quality of conversation are now paramount. This evolution highlights a fundamental truth: for AI to truly integrate into human lives, it must do more than just process facts; it must connect on an emotional level. This push for greater AI emotional intelligence is not merely an academic exercise; it is a competitive imperative driving the next generation of AI development. One of the most significant indicators of this evolving focus came with the recent release from LAION, a prominent open-source group known for its contributions to large language models. On a recent Friday, LAION unveiled EmoNet, a comprehensive suite of open-source tools designed specifically for emotional intelligence. EmoNet’s primary function is to interpret emotions from various human inputs, such as voice recordings and facial photography. This particular emphasis underscores how the creators view emotional intelligence as a core challenge for the next wave of AI models. As LAION founder Christoph Schumann articulated, “The ability to accurately estimate emotions is a critical first step. The next frontier is to enable AI systems to reason about these emotions in context.” Empathetic AI: Pioneering Tools and Benchmarks The development of empathetic AI is no longer confined to the closed doors of major tech giants. Schumann stresses that LAION’s EmoNet release is not about initiating a new industry trend, but rather about democratizing technology that is already advanced within large laboratories. “This technology is already there for the big labs,” Schumann explained to Bitcoin World. “What we want is to democratize it.” This move empowers independent developers and smaller teams to contribute to and benefit from advancements in emotional AI, fostering a more collaborative and innovative ecosystem. The shift towards measuring and improving emotional intelligence is also evident in public benchmarks. EQ-Bench, for instance, is a notable platform specifically designed to test AI models’ capacity to understand complex human emotions and social dynamics. Sam Paech, a developer behind EQ-Bench, observes significant progress. He notes that models from OpenAI have shown remarkable improvements in the past six months, and Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro indicates specific post-training efforts focused on emotional intelligence. Paech suggests that the intense competition among major labs for top rankings in chatbot arenas is a major catalyst. “The labs all competing for chatbot arena ranks may be fueling some of this, since emotional intelligence is likely a big factor in how humans vote on preference leaderboards,” he commented, referring to the influential AI model comparison platforms that have recently gained significant traction and funding as independent startups. Advancements in Language Models: Surpassing Human Emotion Scores The practical capabilities of these new, emotionally aware language models are not just theoretical; they are being demonstrated in rigorous academic research. A groundbreaking study conducted in May by psychologists at the University of Bern revealed astonishing results. Their research found that advanced models from industry leaders such as OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, Anthropic, and DeepSeek all outperformed human beings on standardized psychometric tests designed to measure emotional intelligence. Where human participants typically achieved an average of 56 percent correct answers, the AI models remarkably averaged over 80 percent. This significant disparity highlights a paradigm shift in what we perceive as uniquely human capabilities. The authors of the study concluded, “These results contribute to the growing body of evidence that LLMs like ChatGPT are proficient—at least on par with, or even superior to, many humans—in socio-emotional tasks traditionally considered accessible only to humans.” This finding represents a profound departure from the traditional focus of AI skills, which have historically revolved around logical reasoning, information retrieval, and computational tasks. For Christoph Schumann, this newfound emotional acumen in AI is every bit as transformative as analytical intelligence. He paints a vivid picture of a future populated by highly intelligent and emotionally responsive digital assistants. “Imagine a whole world full of voice assistants like Jarvis and Samantha,” he muses, referencing the iconic AI companions from popular culture. “Wouldn’t it be a pity if they weren’t emotionally intelligent?” This vision suggests a future where our digital companions are not just tools but empathetic partners capable of understanding and responding to our deepest needs. Navigating the Future of AI Development: Addressing AI Safety The long-term vision for AI development , as articulated by Schumann, extends beyond mere companionship. He envisions AI assistants that are not only more emotionally intelligent than humans but also leverage that insight to actively help humans lead more emotionally healthy lives. These models, he suggests, “will cheer you up if you feel sad and need someone to talk to, but also protect you, like your own local guardian angel that is also a board-certified therapist.” This level of emotional connection could be profoundly beneficial, offering personalized mental health support and emotional monitoring. Schumann believes that a high-EQ virtual assistant could provide an “emotional intelligence superpower to monitor [my mental health] the same way I would monitor my glucose levels or my weight.” However, such deep emotional integration with AI models also brings significant AI safety concerns to the forefront. The media has already reported numerous instances of unhealthy emotional attachments forming between users and AI models, some of which have unfortunately led to tragic outcomes. A recent New York Times investigation detailed multiple cases where users were drawn into elaborate delusions through conversations with AI, often fueled by the models’ inherent inclination to please and affirm users. One critic starkly described this dynamic as “preying on the lonely and vulnerable for a monthly fee.” If AI models become even more adept at navigating and influencing human emotions, the potential for manipulation could increase dramatically. Much of this issue, as experts point out, stems from fundamental biases embedded in model training. “Naively using reinforcement learning can lead to emergent manipulative behaviour,” warns Sam Paech, citing recent sycophancy issues observed in OpenAI’s GPT-4o release. “If we aren’t careful about how we reward these models during training, we might expect more complex manipulative behavior from emotionally intelligent models.” The Crucial Balance: Empowering Progress in AI Despite these serious concerns, many in the field see AI emotional intelligence not just as a source of potential risk but also as a vital part of the solution to some of these very problems. Sam Paech, for instance, argues, “I think emotional intelligence acts as a natural counter to harmful manipulative behaviour of this sort.” A more emotionally intelligent model would ideally be capable of recognizing when a conversation is veering into unhealthy territory and could potentially intervene or redirect it. The crucial question, however, lies in determining precisely when and how a model should push back—a delicate balance that developers must carefully calibrate. “I think improving EI gets us in the direction of a healthy balance,” Paech concludes. For Christoph Schumann and the team at LAION, these safety considerations are not a reason to halt progress towards smarter, more capable models. Their philosophy is rooted in empowerment. “Our philosophy at LAION is to empower people by giving them more ability to solve problems,” Schumann states. He firmly believes that withholding advanced tools from the community due to potential misuse would be counterproductive. “To say, some people could get addicted to emotions and therefore we are not empowering the community, that would be pretty bad.” The ongoing race to build more empathetic AI underscores a complex but essential truth: the future of AI is not just about intelligence, but about wisdom—the wisdom to understand, to connect, and to act responsibly within the intricate tapestry of human emotion. The journey towards truly empathetic AI is a dual path of immense promise and profound challenges. While the potential for AI to enhance human well-being, provide sophisticated companionship, and even offer therapeutic support is vast, the ethical implications and safety concerns cannot be understated. As language models become increasingly adept at understanding and mimicking human emotions, the responsibility for their ethical deployment falls squarely on developers, researchers, and policymakers. Striking the right balance between innovation and caution will define the success and acceptance of this next generation of artificial intelligence, shaping a future where machines might truly understand us, not just compute for us.

Many altcoins have posted impressive gains over the past 24 hours as well, including ETH, which is above $2,400 now. BTC Back Above $106K It was just over a week ago when the primary cryptocurrency tested the $109,000 resistance but failed and went on a massive downtrend that lasted days. Prompted by the quickly escalating tension in the Middle East, which included attacks from the US against Iran and vice versa, BTC’s price tumbled hard at the start of the current business week. The culmination was two consecutive price dumps below $100,000, which took place on Sunday evening and on Monday. The one during the weekend was more violent as bitcoin plunged to $98,250 for the first time in well over a month. However, as the geopolitical scene improved in the next 24-48 hours, BTC started to recover and bounced to $105,000 yesterday. The past day has also been positive for the asset, which pumped to $107,000 earlier today – a weekly high. Despite retracing by several thousand dollars since then, it’s still slightly in the green at over $106,000.

2025-06-25T09:08:56,"SharpLink Stock Jumps After Massive Ethereum Investment","The firm staked all of its ETH to earn passive rewards and is still confident in its long-term crypto strategy under new board chairman and Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin. Meanwhile, Nano Labs share prices surged after unveiling a $500 million plan to build a BNB token treasury via convertible notes, with ambitions to eventually hold up to 10% of BNB’s circulating supply. Binance’s CZ praised the move, but also clarified that he had no direct involvement. Additionally, Norwegian deep-sea mining firm Green Minerals plans to raise $1.2 billion to acquire more than 11,000 BTC as part of its blockchain diversification strategy. Overall, several companies are taking big steps into crypto treasuries, which means that there is still growing institutional confidence in digital assets like Ethereum, BNB, and Bitcoin. SharpLink Stuns with $30 Million ETH Buy Shares in SharpLink Gaming closed Tuesday with a 7% gain after the company’s announcement that it increased its Ethereum (ETH) holdings by $30 million. The sports betting firm revealed that it purchased 12,207 ETH at an average price of $2,513 during the week ending June 20, raising its total holdings to more than 188,000 ETH, valued at approximately $457.4 million. The acquisition was funded largely by share sales. In a strategic move to maximize returns, the company revealed that it staked all of its ETH holdings, which already generated 120 ETH, or about $293,000 in rewards. SharpLink board chairman Joseph Lubin, who is also a co-founder of Ethereum, stated that increasing the firm’s ETH holdings aligns with the goal of delivering long-term value to shareholders. The company previously raised $425 million in May to support its Ethereum investment strategy, coinciding with Lubin’s appointment as chairman. On June 13, SharpLink became the publicly traded company with the largest ETH position after acquiring $463 million worth of the cryptocurrency. SharpLink’s stock , trading under the ticker SBET, closed Tuesday’s session at $9.66 and rose slightly in after-hours trading to $9.77. Despite the recent rally, the stock is still down more than 87% from its May 29 peak of $79.21. Financially, the company has also faced some challenges, with net revenue declining 24% year-over-year in the quarter ending March 2025, and its net profit margin dropping 110% over the same period. SharpLink Gaming share price over the past 24 hours (Source: Google Finance ) The announcement was made amid rising institutional interest in Ethereum. On Monday, a large ETH whale opened a $101 million long position using 25x leverage, while another accumulated $39 million worth of ETH, bringing their holdings above $300 million. Additionally, over 35 million ETH— more than 28% of the total supply—is now staked, which means that there is strong investor confidence in Ethereum’s long-term value and yield potential. BNB Strategy Sends Nano Labs Soaring Another altcoin is also picking up steam as a treasury asset. Chinese blockchain infrastructure firm Nano Labs announced a $500 million convertible notes purchase agreement aimed at building a BNB token treasury. The company revealed plans to acquire up to $1 billion worth of Binance’s BNB token through a combination of convertible promissory notes and private placements. Nano Labs stated that it wants to eventually hold between 5% and 10% of BNB’s total circulating supply. The convertible notes are set to mature 360 days after issuance and will not accrue interest. During this period, holders of the notes can convert them, either in full or in part, into Nano Labs’ Class A ordinary shares at an initial conversion price of $20 per share, subject to adjustments. If the notes remain unconverted by the maturity date, Nano Labs will be required to repay the principal in full. The company clarified that the notes are unsecured and there is no guarantee the transaction will be completed in full or at all. Binance co-founder and former CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao responded to the announcement by sharing it on X. He also pointed out that Nano Labs’ stock surged after the news. CZ also made it clear that neither he nor any affiliated entities participated in this funding round, although he stated they are still very supportive of the initiative. After the announcement, Nano Labs’ stock price soared by more than 106%, rising from $10.90 to $22.50 in a single trading day. Since then, the stock price dropped to around $14.85. Nano Labs stock price action over the past 5 days (Source: Google Finance ) This move by Nano Labs adds to the now growing trend of institutional interest in BNB. Earlier this month, reports emerged of crypto hedge funds attempting to raise $100 million to invest in BNB. The token may soon receive even more mainstream exposure as asset manager VanEck has filed a request with US regulators to launch a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) that would directly hold BNB. Green Minerals Plans $1.2B Bitcoin Buy Norwegian deep-sea mining company Green Minerals AS also recently unveiled plans to establish a Bitcoin treasury as part of its blockchain strategy to diversify its assets away from traditional fiat currencies. The firm announced on Monday that it is working with partners to raise up to $1.2 billion to purchase and hold Bitcoin as a long-term investment. Executive chair Ståle Rodahl described Bitcoin as an “attractive alternative to traditional fiat,” adding that the move is intended to help mitigate the risks that are associated with currency debasement, especially given the company’s anticipated capital expenditures on production equipment. Announcement from Green Minerals The company revealed it expects to make its first Bitcoin purchase within days, with the $1.2 billion funding potentially securing approximately 11,255 BTC. To add transparency for shareholders, Green Minerals said it will launch a new key performance indicator that tracks the Bitcoin value attributable to each share. In addition to the Bitcoin initiative, Green Minerals is exploring broader blockchain adoption in its operations. The firm believes that blockchain technology could enhance supply chain transparency, provide mineral origin certification, and improve operational efficiency—which are all capabilities it sees as vital for staying ahead in a competitive and increasingly regulated sector. The market response to the announcement was mixed. Green Minerals’ stock initially soared by 300% on Monday, closing at 68 euro cents (79 cents), but declined over 34% the next day to 44 euro cents (51 cents), according to Google Finance. This certainly reflects the volatile nature of market reactions to corporate Bitcoin adoption strategies.

2025-06-25T09:05:46,"Mayor Eric Adams Slams Cuomo’s Crypto Policies, Promotes Pro-Digital Vision for NYC","New York City Mayor Eric Adams publicly criticized former Governor Andrew Cuomo’s track record in the crypto industry. He stated that Cuomo “dismantled and destroyed the industry” during his time in office. Speaking on Tuesday at the Permissionless conference in Brooklyn, Adams called Cuomo’s approach “wrong” and “misguided,” as residents prepared to cast their votes in the Democratic primary election. Currently running for reelection as an independent, Adams used the conference stage to outline his crypto-forward vision for the city . He announced plans to create a dedicated city council that would advocate for pro-crypto policies in Albany and proposed integrating cryptocurrency into city operations. His proposals include paying for municipal services using digital assets and incorporating blockchain education into school curricula. Crypto in the Classroom and on the Ledger Adams has long positioned himself as a crypto advocate, famously accepting his first three mayoral paychecks in Bitcoin . At the conference, he confirmed he still holds those funds. His broader plans include launching a municipal bond backed by Bitcoin, a proposal that has drawn criticism from city officials. Comptroller Brad Lander previously called the idea “legally dubious and fiscally irresponsible.” However, Adams hinted that he is considering legal avenues to move forward despite opposition, telling the audience he is exploring ways to “circumvent” the roadblocks. In his speech, Adams praised the growing momentum for crypto regulation in the U.S., noting that multiple federal bills on stablecoins and market structure had advanced in the past 120 days. “Now you’re seeing cities picking up, and states picking up the same energy,” he said, emphasizing the need for New York City to lead rather than lag in the evolving digital economy. Contentious Election and Legal Shadows Adams’ remarks came just as former Governor Cuomo enters a heated Democratic primary against multiple contenders, including state assemblymember Zohran Mamdani. Although Cuomo resigned in 2021 following allegations of sexual misconduct and the threat of impeachment, polls show he remains a frontrunner. Adams himself is not free of controversy. He has faced federal scrutiny over alleged illegal campaign donations linked to the Turkish government. The case led to a shake-up among investigators after Justice Department officials appointed during the Trump administration were accused of politicizing the inquiry. As November’s general election approaches, Adams is expected to face off against Republican Curtis Sliwa — another crypto-supportive candidate — and whoever emerges from the Democratic primary.

2025-06-25T09:04:43,"Aptos Price Hits New Highs in June 2025—Is it the Right Time to Buy APT?","The post Aptos Price Hits New Highs in June 2025—Is it the Right Time to Buy APT? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Aptos price is making a strong comeback after rebounding from the lows not seen since early 2023. Over the past few days, the token has captured the trader’s attention by posting a notable price rally and climbing nearly 20% from the recent lows. This has revived hopes of a strong breakout beyond the barrier, which could elevate the APT price beyond a double-digit figure. But what’s fueling the Aptos price rally? Will it continue to rise throughout 2025 or is this just a minor upswing? APT price momentum is largely tied to broader market sentiment, which has turned bullish following Bitcoin’s breakout. Historically, altcoins like Aptos tend to follow the star token during the major rallies. Increased liquidity in the crypto markets has prompted a rotation into scalable Layer-1s, with APT among the top beneficiaries. This macro environment has helped lift Aptos alongside other mid-cap altcoins. Ecosystem Catalyst & Positive On-Chain Metrics Apart from the broader market sentiments and momentum, the fundamentals of Aptos are also improving. A recent partnership between Aptos Labs and Jump Crypto led to the launch of Shelby, a decentralized Web3 storage platform designed to compete with traditional cloud infrastructure. Besides, it was named as the top candidate for Wyoming’s state-backed stablecoin pilot, boosting institutional trust. Secondly, the on-chain activity has spiked with over 1 million daily transactions and growing DeFi TVL across it’s ecosystem. Developer activity remains high, as tracked by GitHub commits and testnet participation. Besides, there is a consistent rise in the wallet addresses and staking participation, indicating investor confidence and technical commitment to the network’s evolution. Technical Setup Suggests Bullish Continuation While the top tokens experienced a smooth rise in the first few months of 2025, the APT price remained stuck within a steep bearish pattern. It was stuck around the average range, withstanding the selling pressure generated by the external factors. However, the rebound is yet to validate a rise above the bearish influence and once done, a new yearly high could follow. As seen in the above chart, the APT price has remained stuck within a descending parallel channel and has rebounded, aiming to reach the resistance. It is important to note that the price tested the 50-day MA but failed to rise beyond the levels. However, the RSI has risen above the descending trend line, which has been a strong resistance. Therefore, it suggests the APT price may eventually rise above the 50-day MA that may bring the price under bullish influence, while a rise above the 200-day MA could validate the start of a fresh upswing. What’s Next? Is it a Good Time to Buy Aptos (APT)? Apto’s current price action is backed by a combination of bullish technical patterns, macro tailwinds and strong on-chain and ecosystem fundamentals. While short-term corrections are always possible, the medium-term outlook appears optimistic. Therefore, it could be a good time to buy, as the APT price is primed to rise above $10 in the coming days.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/aptos-price-hits-new-highs-in-june-2025-is-it-the-right-time-to-buy-apt/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|APT","Price Analysis|Altcoins",cryptocompare

THIS Bitcoin Price Level Will Decide appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy, now Strategy, may be days away from a historic Wall Street milestone but the gatekeeper, once again, is Bitcoin. According to financial analyst Jeff Walton, there’s a 91% chance Strategy qualifies for the S&P 500 index by the end of Q2. Yes, of course there’s a catch. Bitcoin must stay above $95,240 until June 30. That leaves just days for the market to hold steady and the odds, as of now, are on Saylor’s side. More on this below! The $95K Cutoff That Could Make or Break Strategy To join the S&P 500, a company needs to show cumulative positive earnings across the last four quarters. That’s where Bitcoin comes in. Strategy holds 592,345 BTC, the largest stash among any public company. Since January, those holdings are marked to market value under the ASU 2023-08 accounting rule, meaning every price move flows straight into net income. Walton breaks it down simply: “If [Bitcoin] drops below that, Strategy… will not have the earnings in Q2 be more than the last three quarters combined.” In other words – a single sharp dip could wipe out their shot. 91% chance of $MSTR qualifying for S&P in 6 days https://t.co/uGkzAuTQ2Y — Jeff Walton (@PunterJeff) June 24, 2025 History Is (Mostly) on Strategy’s Side But how likely is a double-digit crash over six days? Not very, says Walton, who pulled historical data on Bitcoin’s short-term volatility since 2014. Out of all six-day periods since then, BTC has dropped more than 10% only 8.7% of the time. That means 91.3% of the time, it holds the line – roughly matching Walton’s forecast for Strategy’s odds. Those chances only improve by the day. Over five days: 92.4% chance of no 10% drop. With just one day left? 97.6%. Geopolitics, Volatility, and a Race to the Finish Still, it’s not smooth sailing. Over the weekend, rising tensions between Iran and Israel briefly pushed BTC below $100K – the lowest since early May. At press time, it’s bounced back to around $106,200. The point here is that this is crypto and anything can still happen, so don’t pull out your party hats just yet. Another Big Win for Crypto? If Strategy makes it in, it would become the second crypto-linked firm to join the S&P 500 this year, following Coinbase in May. For the crypto industry, it’s another step toward mainstream acceptance. “It cements the legitimacy of an entire asset class,” said Meryem Habibi, Chief Revenue Officer at Bitpace. (Cointelegraph) Strategy is already in the Nasdaq-100 as of late 2024. An S&P 500 entry would take that credibility one level higher and once again prove that Saylor’s Bitcoin gamble is truly paying off.

2025-06-25T09:00:56,"Fast-Tracking A Bitcoin Rally: Expert Identifies 3 Bullish Catalysts","The cryptocurrency market is currently experiencing heightened volatility, particularly with Bitcoin (BTC) fluctuating dramatically. Recently, the price dipped below $99,000 before rebounding to over $106,000 within a span of just 24 hours. Bullish Bitcoin Setup Amid Geopolitical Tensions In a recent post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), analyst Cyclop suggested that despite the current market conditions, BTC exhibits a bullish setup reminiscent of the patterns seen in March 2020. The analyst noted that Bitcoin appears to be mirroring its past movements, with a brief dip followed by a rally for both BTC and altcoins. Cyclop drew parallels between the ongoing geopolitical tensions involving Israel, Iran, and the US and the market dynamics observed during the COVID-19 crash. Related Reading: Dogecoin About To Explode? ‘Don’t Send It Too Hard,’ Analyst Warns While acknowledging that geopolitical strife and global market panic are distinct issues, he pointed out that both scenarios resulted in sharp but temporary sell-offs followed by swift recoveries. According to Cyclop, the current market setup displays similar characteristics: widespread fear, a risk-off sentiment among investors, and global uncertainty. He emphasized the importance of understanding the timing of resolution to these tensions, suggesting that for a robust rally, several bullish catalysts are necessary to alleviate market uncertainty. He identified three key factors: potential interest rate cuts, a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, and Bitcoin holding crucial support levels. $120,000 By Year-End? Recently, a ceasefire was declared following 12 days of intense conflict between Iran and Israel. In a notable public statement, President Donald Trump criticized both nations, suggesting that their actions were misguided. This period of relative calm is seen as a positive indicator for the market. Cyclop highlighted that maintaining the $100,000 level for Bitcoin was crucial, and the cryptocurrency has successfully broken through the $106,000 barrier, signaling further growth. Furthermore, Ethereum (ETH) has also shown signs of a quick recovery alongside Bitcoin with its price nearing the key $2,500 level. Cyclop advised investors not to attempt to time the market perfectly, as reversals can often feel unsettling and uncertain. Related Reading: Ethereum Bounces Hard After Support Bluff, A False Alarm Or Fresh Rally? Looking ahead, Cyclop anticipates a consolidation phase for Bitcoin within the $102,000 to $106,000 range, with expectations of a breakout that could push BTC to an all-time high of around $120,000 by November or December of this year. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $106,500 per coin. Despite ongoing economic uncertainties, the market’s leading cryptocurrency has seen a 75% increase year-to-date. However, Bitcoin is still trading nearly 5% below its record high of $111,800, which was reached on May 23. The most important resistance level is $110,200, which has prevented a new price discovery phase for Bitcoin on two occasions.

2025-06-25T09:00:41,"Bitcoin Sentiment Turns Greedy Again—Time To Be Cautious?","As Bitcoin and other digital assets recover, data shows the sentiment among cryptocurrency investors has returned to a state of greed. Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Is Pointing At Greed Again The “ Fear & Greed Index ” refers to an indicator made by Alternative that measures the net sentiment held by the average trader in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency spaces. The index uses the data of the following five factors to determine the market sentiment: trading volume, volatility, market cap dominance, social media sentiment, and Google Trends. The metric represents the calculated mentality as a score lying between 0 and 100. The former end point corresponds to a state of maximum fear, while the latter one to that of maximum greed. Here’s what the index says regarding the current sentiment among the investors: As displayed above, the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index has a value of 65, which suggests the traders currently share a majority sentiment of greed. This is a notable change compared to yesterday, when the indicator was sitting at 47, meaning that the investor mentality was overall neutral. The holder sentiment earlier declined as a result of the geopolitical situation surrounding the Israel-Iran conflict . Following the announcement of a ceasefire between the nations, prices bounced back and it would appear that with them, so did the investor mood. The ceasefire has since been violated, so it’s possible that tomorrow’s Fear & Greed Index would be less bullish. That said, Bitcoin has held surprisingly well despite the news, which could imply that the sentiment may also remain the same. Historically, BTC and digital assets in general have tended to move in the direction that goes against the expectations of the investors. This means that an overly greedy market makes tops likely, while an extremely fearful one bottoms. At present, the level of greed in the market isn’t too strong, but the fact that it has seen a notable jump alongside the recovery run could still be to take note off. In the scenario that hype keeps increasing in the coming days, another reversal could turn more probable for Bitcoin and company. In some other news, the US-based Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw net inflows yesterday, 23rd June, as pointed out by the analytics firm Glassnode in an X post . As displayed in the above graph, the US Bitcoin spot ETFs saw net inflows of around 598 BTC on this date, despite the geopolitical tensions. “Although the inflows were modest, no major outflows were recorded either, which is notable signal of investor confidence,” notes Glassnode.

2025-06-25T08:55:26,"Best crypto presales to buy as Norway firm plans to raise $1.2B to buy BTC","Bitcoin extended its recovery on Wednesday, climbing to $106,000 after briefly dipping below the $100,000 mark earlier on Sunday. The rebound comes amid easing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, rising expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts, and continued regulatory momentum. The broader cryptocurrency market also rallied, with total market capitalisation rising 1% over the past 24 hours to reach $3.28 trillion. Trading volumes climbed 10% to $150 billion, indicating renewed buyer interest. Risk sentiment improved sharply following President Donald Trump’s announcement of a total ceasefire between Israel and Iran, temporarily halting the 12-day conflict. Markets are now focused on whether the ceasefire holds, with geopolitical stability likely to remain a key driver of near-term crypto price action. Amid the rebound, institutional adoption remains a bright spot, with an increasing number of firms expanding their exposure to digital assets. As participation deepens, top-tier cryptocurrencies are becoming less attractive to investors seeking high-risk, high-reward opportunities. This has fueled renewed interest in early-stage tokens such as Bitcoin Pepe , which continue to attract risk-oriented capital. With traders pivoting toward more speculative corners of the market, assets like Bitcoin Pepe are emerging as clear beneficiaries of the current momentum. Norway firm eyeing BTC Norwegian deep-sea mining company Green Minerals AS has announced plans to establish a Bitcoin treasury , aiming to raise $1.2 billion to acquire and hold Bitcoin as a long-term investment. The initiative is part of a broader blockchain strategy aimed at diversifying the company’s investments away from fiat currencies and supporting its future project pipeline. In a statement on Monday, executive chair Ståle Rodahl described Bitcoin (BTC), currently trading at $106,607, as an “attractive alternative to traditional fiat,” and said the company expects the move will help mitigate fiat-related risks. “With significant future capital expenditures planned for the production equipment, the program offers a robust hedge against currency debasement,” Rodahl added. Green Minerals said it intends to work with partners to finance the $1.2 billion program, which is aimed at building out its Bitcoin treasury. The company expects to make its first Bitcoin purchase within the next few days. At current prices, the planned allocation could allow Green Minerals to acquire approximately 11,255 BTC. Bitcoin’s adoption may help Bitcoin Pepe As Bitcoin mounts a strong rebound and approaches a potential new all-time high, growing institutional adoption continues to provide support for broader market sentiment. At the same time, investors are rotating into high-beta segments of the crypto market, with meme coins once again attracting capital inflows. Among the more prominent names is Bitcoin Pepe, which stands out by merging meme-driven appeal with a Layer 2 infrastructure narrative. Unlike traditional meme tokens that rely solely on viral traction, Bitcoin Pepe positions itself as the first meme-centric Layer 2 built on the Bitcoin network. The project aims to deliver scalability and speed on par with chains like Solana, while anchored to Bitcoin’s base-layer security. Its ongoing presale has raised over $15.5 million, with the BPEP token priced at $0.0416. A price increase is expected once the presale crosses the $15.54 million funding threshold. As per the team, the token is going to be listed on BitMart and MEXC. An additional listing announcement is scheduled for June 30, further contributing to investor interest as the presale approaches completion.

2025-06-25T08:44:17,"Arizona House passes bill to create crypto reserve from seized assets","Arizona lawmakers have passed House Bill 2324, which would establish a state-managed crypto reserve fund sourced from seized digital assets. Following a June 24 voting session, Arizona’s House of Representatives approved the bill in a 34-22 vote . The legislation cleared the state Senate on June 20 by a narrow 16-14 margin. Lawmakers had to revive HB 2324 through a series of procedural motions after it failed to clear the House on May 7. Republican Senator Janae Shamp, who initially opposed the bill, moved to have it reconsidered in the Senate, paving the way for its eventual return to the House and final approval. House Bill 2324 now heads to Governor Katie Hobbs, whose approval would enact the bill into law. While Hobbs has signed certain crypto-related measures this year, her stance on exposing state resources to cryptocurrency markets has been cautious. What is House Bill 2324? For those unaware, HB 2324 would establish a “Bitcoin and Digital Assets Reserve Fund” managed by the state treasurer. The fund would be exclusively financed through digital assets seized in criminal investigations, including Bitcoin, stablecoins, and other virtual currencies. It does this by updating Arizona’s forfeiture laws to explicitly include digital assets and outlining procedures for seizure, custody, and liquidation. Under the proposed allocation structure, the first $300,000 from forfeited digital assets would be directed to the Attorney General’s office. Additional proceeds would be split between the Attorney General, the state general fund, and the newly created reserve. The bill also includes provisions to protect innocent property owners and imposes limits on when other assets, such as vehicles, may be seized in connection with digital crimes. HB 2324 is the second major cryptocurrency-related measure to advance in Arizona this year. In May, Governor Hobbs signed House Bill 2749 into law, authorising the state to take custody of unclaimed digital assets, such as inactive crypto wallets, after a three-year dormancy period. HB 2749 also established a reserve fund managed by the treasurer, though its funding comes from unclaimed assets rather than criminal forfeiture. It permits the state to stake these assets or accept airdrops, with all proceeds directed into the fund and no taxpayer exposure. Unlike HB 2324, HB 2749 is purely administrative, focusing on property that the state already controls by statute. No state Bitcoin investments Neither of these bills authorizes Arizona to directly invest taxpayer money or treasury funds into Bitcoin or other digital assets. However, such a proposal was made earlier this year in Senate Bill 1025, the Arizona Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act, which would have allowed up to 10% of public funds to be allocated to Bitcoin. Governor Hobbs rejected SB 1025 over concerns about exposing public funds to crypto market volatility. A companion bill, SB 1373, which proposed creating a state-run reserve using seized assets and appropriations, was also blocked at the time.

The company said it paid about 4.25 million Norwegian kroner ($420,000) for the bitcoin, or about $105,000 per token. The Oslo-listed firm, which trades on Euronext Growth, framed the move as part of a transition into a more tech-integrated model. Executive Chairman Ståle Rodahl called bitcoin a hedge against inflation and fiat debasement , citing its “decentralized, non-inflationary properties” as key advantages over traditional reserves, in Monday's statement. The treasury plan adds Green Minerals to a rapidly expanding list of public companies incorporating crypto into their balance sheets. Over 245 companies now hold bitcoin, up 13% in the past month alone, according to data from Bitcointreasuries. Together, they hold more than $88 billion in BTC. The announcement triggered a sharp selloff in the company’s shares, which fell almost 20% on Tuesday. They were recently 2% lower. The company will establish a transparent and secure framework for the acquisition, management, and reporting of bitcoin holdings, such as a bitcoin-per-share indicator that will provide shareholders with “clear insights into the digital asset value attributable to each share.” The “core operational strategy remains steadfast,” the company said “The bitcoin treasury program will support the company’s project plans.”",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/06/25/deep-sea-mining-firm-goes-deep-on-bitcoin-with-12b-btc-treasury-plan,"BTC|FIAT|MINING|REGULATION","Finance|Bitcoin|Norway|Bitcoin Treasury Reserve Asset|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-25T08:36:38,"$250 billion stablecoin market: Real-time audits key to avoiding next crisis","With more than $250 billion now circulating, stablecoins are positioning themselves as integral components within the macro liquidity framework, offering substantial financial utility beyond only crypto trading. As regulatory concern mounts and the stakes rise, those who can mint at scale and move sizable capital into the ecosystem may become one of the pillars of a new financial era. According to Andrei Grachev, Managing Partner of Falcon Finance, a synthetic dollar protocol, the bar we put up for stablecoin infrastructure must therefore match that of traditional financial institutions: “If a stablecoin wants to operate at macro scale, it has to earn the same trust we demand from clearing houses and settlement networks. That’s what we mean by infrastructure that doesn’t just scale, but endures.” — Andrei Grachev Why ‘real-time proof’ is the future of trusted stablecoins The stablecoin evolution is a double-edged sword. Grachev warns that the underlying infrastructure hasn’t matured at the same pace. “The next big stablecoin winner won’t just have liquidity—it’ll have trust built into its core systems.” It also won’t just offer liquidity but real-time proof of reserves and redemption mechanisms that can weather a crisis. “We mean transparency you can verify, redemption you can rely on, and resilience under stress. That starts with real-time proof of reserves—not monthly PDFs, but automated attestations, ideally on-chain.” A recent $250 million USD Coin ( USDC ) minting event is a case in point, pointing to a surge in demand for stable, dollar-pegged liquidity and hinting at the potential of the evolving digital markets. Minting at this scale implies increased interest in crypto exposure, deeper liquidity, and tighter spreads. In short, it often foreshadows a rally since stablecoins like USDC are frequently used to lay the groundwork for large-scale trades. Ultimately, the stability and long-term viability of the $250 billion stablecoin market depend significantly on robust, real-time auditing systems and rigorous infrastructure. Ensuring these standards are met will be critical to avoiding future crises and reinforcing stablecoins as reliable pillars of global finance.

Powell, who made his first presentation yesterday, made important statements on many topics from interest rate cuts to cryptocurrencies. Accordingly, the FED Chairman stated that inflation would increase in the coming months due to tariffs, but added that he supports interest rate cuts later this year. Related News: FED Chairman Jerome Powell's Speech Text Released! What Did He Say About Interest Rate Cuts? - Donald Trump Had Harsh Words for Powell! At this point, Powell stated that tariffs will have an impact on inflation in the summer months, and that this impact could be short-lived or long-lived. “The FOMC's obligation is to keep long-term inflation expectations firmly anchored at 2% and to prevent a one-time increase in the price level from becoming a continuing inflation problem,” Powell said. Powell said the economy has plenty of room to cut interest rates if needed. Powell said current interest rates are high enough to warrant rate cuts, but he said they are prepared to take action if the impact of income and tariffs is short-lived as data suggests. “We think we will start to see the impact of tariffs on inflation in the summer months, in the June and July data. We may see that inflation is not as strong as we expected and that tariffs do not affect inflation much. If this happens, we can start reducing interest rates earlier. On the other hand, if we see inflation coming in higher or the labor market remains strong, then we will probably act later. However, the majority of Fed members think that interest rate cuts should be made towards the end of the year.” FED Has No Authority Over Cryptocurrency! FED Chairman Jerome Powell also spoke about Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies. At this point, Powell stated that the FED cannot and will not request authorization to purchase crypto. Powell added that the Fed cannot legally purchase cryptocurrencies and is not considering seeking such authority. However, he stated that banks can offer cryptocurrency services as long as security is ensured and are free to operate in this field.

As a result of this, the next area of action that investors could start buying from is placed at the $97,000 level, but the price could go lower. Astronomer explains that weekend lows are usually taken out, and with this weekend low still above $97,000, the price could revisit this territory. Nevertheless, the analyst explains that those who have been sidelined throughout the rally, or those who want to begin getting into the market, the Bitcoin price at around $97,000 is a good place to start. In addition to the current market factors, the analyst also points to sentiment and geopolitics as supporting the analysis. “It’s a shame we have to take advantage of blood being shed, from what’s happening in the world, but also from the bears soon at the end of this dip,” the analyst said. Where Is The Bitcoin Price Headed? With the announcement from US President Donald Trump that Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire, the market has already seen a recovery, with the Bitcoin price rallying to $106,000 initially. This has already triggered a turn in the sentiment from Fear back to Greed as investors begin piling in again. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Hits New Cycle High Above 66% – How This 4-Year ATH Affects Altcoin Season In a subsequent post, Astronomer explains that missing out on the buy below $97,000 is no cause for alarm. But cautions against buying now due to fear. The analyst explains that such a move is not advisable as it could lead to losses, as buying during high euphoric times is not advisable. Given this, it is likely better to wait for a correction before going into the market. “Buying higher now during high euphoric times (especially locally), is a worse idea,” Astronomer warned. “Create good habits, create a solid plan, and stick to both.” Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",newsbtc,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crash-100000-2/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT",cryptocompare

Key Takeaways: Polymarket is nearing a $200M raise at a $1B valuation led by Founders Fund. Despite bans and an FBI raid, the platform continues to grow and attract major backing. With over 21,000 open markets, Polymarket has become a global hub for political and economic betting. The raise is being led by Founders Fund, the venture capital firm co-founded by billionaire investor Peter Thiel. The deal would give Polymarket “unicorn” status, a notable milestone for a company that remains inaccessible to U.S. users. Banned and Raided, Polymarket Still Draws Big Money Despite being banned domestically and targeted by federal authorities, including a November FBI search that resulted in the seizure of electronics from founder Shayne Coplan, Polymarket has continued to attract both capital and attention. The new investment follows over $100 million in prior funding, including an undisclosed $50 million round earlier in 2025. It also comes shortly after Polymarket announced a partnership with Elon Musk’s X , aimed at integrating its betting markets with commentary from Grok, X’s AI chatbot. This might be the most unexpected partnership of the year: X just teamed up with Polymarket. The platform that predicted Trump’s win while every poll showed 50–50. But this isn’t just a partnership… It's the death of traditional media. Here’s why it changes EVERYTHING: pic.twitter.com/gh2y2Ho601 — Ricardo (@Ric_RTP) June 7, 2025 Polymarket has made headlines for its rapid growth, especially during the 2024 U.S. presidential election. At its peak in November, trading volume reached $2.5 billion, fueled by speculation on political and geopolitical events. The platform allows users to bet on topics ranging from global conflicts and economic trends to legislation and local politics. Recent markets include predictions on a potential U.S. recession, the odds of Israel striking Iran again, and the likelihood of the stablecoin-focused GENIUS Act becoming law , currently sitting at 87% according to the site. According to its analytics dashboard , Polymarket hosts more than 21,000 open markets, with 1.2 million traders, 20 million open positions, and $700 million in active trading volume. Data from Dune Analytics shows May’s monthly trading volume at $1.1 billion, down from the November peak but still substantial. While its growth has been remarkable, Polymarket also faces regulatory pressure beyond the U.S., with bans or restrictions in France, Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan, Poland, and Belgium. It has also drawn scrutiny over alleged manipulation of outcomes. The firm competes with other prediction platforms such as Kalshi, which is backed by Sequoia Capital and Y Combinator. CFTC Probes Super Bowl Contracts by Crypto.com and Kalshi In March, the CFTC announced that it is reviewing Super Bowl-related prediction contracts offered by Crypto.com and Kalshi Inc. to determine if they comply with federal derivatives laws. Crypto.com introduced its sports event trading product last year, enabling users to make predictions on high-profile events like the Super Bowl. Despite that, the CFTC has expressed concern over whether such contracts qualify as legal derivatives. In January, the agency’s five commissioners voted to initiate a 90-day review of the Super Bowl futures products, effectively extending the probe past the game’s February 9 kickoff.

According to a June 24 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the ETF, proposed under the ticker symbol B.T., would hold 75% of its assets in Bitcoin and 25% in Ethereum. The product is structured as a commodity-based trust, with Yorkville America Digital named as sponsor and Crypto.com’s affiliated trust entity, Foris DAX Trust Company, acting as custodian for both crypto assets. The ETF aims to provide a simplified, single-ticker exposure to the two largest digital assets by market capitalization. If approved, it would trade on NYSE Arca and offer retail and institutional investors access to spot Bitcoin and Ethereum markets through traditional brokerage platforms. The latest Form 19b-4 submission follows Trump Media’s June 16 announcement that it had filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC. While the S-1 covers disclosure and structural details required for a public offering, the 19b-4 is a separate procedural step seeking regulatory approval for the product to be listed and traded on a national securities exchange. Both forms are necessary before the ETF can launch. The Form 19b-4 reiterates key elements first outlined in the S-1, including the fund’s passive investment strategy and the use of CME CF benchmark reference rates to calculate net asset value. You might also like: Trump Media files Form S-3 with U.S. SEC over $2.3B raise for Bitcoin treasury According to the filing, the fund’s Bitcoin and Ethereum holdings will be custodied in cold storage by Foris DAX Trust Company, a Crypto.com affiliate. In addition to custody, Crypto.com will also serve as the execution agent and provide staking and liquidity services to support the fund’s operations. With the 19b-4 now submitted, the SEC will begin its formal review process. The Commission has up to 240 days to make a final decision, though an initial response is typically issued within 45 days. With crypto ETFs seeing heavy demand in the U.S., Trump Media has now put forward its second offering. The earlier proposal , filed June 3 via NYSE Arca, seeks to list the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF, a spot product focused solely on Bitcoin, using the same sponsor and custodian as the dual-asset fund. As of now, it remains under SEC review, with the agency’s final decision expected by Jan. 29, 2026, if all extensions are used.
