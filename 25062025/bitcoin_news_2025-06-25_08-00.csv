2025-06-25T05:56:58,"Anthony Pompliano’s ProCap Buys $386M in Bitcoin Ahead of IPO","Bitcoin advocate and entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano has made a bold entrance into corporate crypto holdings. Key Takeaways: ProCap BTC purchased 3,724 BTC for $386 million ahead of its planned IPO via SPAC merger. The firm’s Bitcoin holdings are now worth nearly $400 million as BTC prices rise. ProCap aims to accumulate up to $1 billion in BTC, joining a wave of corporate treasury buyers. His firm, ProCap BTC, announced Tuesday that it had acquired 3,724 BTC for $386 million, just days after revealing plans to go public later this year. The purchase was made at a time-weighted average price of $103,785 per Bitcoin. Bitcoin Gains Lift Pompliano’s Investment to Nearly $400M With Bitcoin prices climbing since the buy, Pompliano’s investment now sits just below $400 million in value. The acquisition follows Monday’s announcement that ProCap intends to go public through a merger with Columbus Circle Capital, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), forming a new entity named ProCap Financial. “We believe Bitcoin is the new hurdle rate. If you can’t beat it, you have to buy it,” Pompliano wrote on X, underscoring the firm’s conviction in the asset. We have purchased 3,724 Bitcoin. This purchase happened within one day after announcing a $1 BILLION merger and over $750 million fundraise. The average price was ~ $103,785 per bitcoin. We believe bitcoin is the new hurdle rate. If you can’t beat it, you have to buy it.… pic.twitter.com/eX1iI9fVhm — Anthony Pompliano (@APompliano) June 24, 2025 The firm plans to accumulate up to $1 billion in Bitcoin as part of its broader treasury strategy. Backers of the upcoming SPAC deal have already raised over $750 million, $516 million in equity commitments and $235 million via convertible notes. Should ProCap go public today, its BTC position would rank 14th among all publicly listed companies, according to BiTBO data. It would sit just behind Semler Scientific, a medical technology firm that recently entered the Bitcoin treasury space. ProCap joins a growing number of firms moving aggressively into Bitcoin. MicroStrategy extended its lead this week with holdings now totaling 592,345 BTC. Japan’s Metaplanet increased its exposure to 11,111 BTC . Grant Cardone’s real estate group disclosed its first buy, 1,000 BTC, while mineral exploration company Panther Metals laid out a $5.4 million crypto strategy combining traditional mining with digital assets. Also this week, Norway’s Green Minerals AS revealed plans to allocate $1.2 billion toward Bitcoin purchases. VanEck Warns BTC Treasury Strategy May Backfire Just recently, VanEck’s head of digital asset research, Matthew Sigel, raised concerns about the Bitcoin treasury strategies used by certain public companies, suggesting that continued accumulation of BTC could soon harm shareholders more than help. He specifically criticized the use of at-the-market (ATM) share issuance programs, warning that they can become dilutive when stock prices approach the company’s Bitcoin net asset value (NAV). Sigel proposed several measures to prevent value erosion, including pausing ATM programs if a company’s stock trades below 0.95x NAV for over 10 days. He drew comparisons to past failures in the crypto mining sector, where excessive dilution and executive pay led to major shareholder losses. As an example, he cited Semler Scientific, a medical tech firm that entered the BTC space in 2024. Despite acquiring 3,808 BTC, its stock has fallen over 45%, and its mNAV has dropped to 0.82x.

2025-06-25T05:34:20,"Senators Skip Key Crypto Hearing as Political Divides Deepen","The goal of the session was to advance a bipartisan market structure bill, but it ended up highlighting political tensions as there was only one Democrat present. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is reportedly preparing an executive order to prevent banks from debanking crypto firms, after accusations of politically motivated discrimination known as “Operation Chokepoint 2.0.” However, the Federal Reserve announced it will no longer consider “reputational risk” in bank oversight, which was a policy that was criticized for harming crypto companies. Low Turnout at Senate Hearing Raises Doubts A recent US Senate hearing that was intended to explore bipartisan legislative frameworks for digital asset market structure saw very low attendance, with only five of the 11 members of the Senate Banking Committee’s digital assets subcommittee present. The hearing was chaired by Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis, and featured testimony from former regulators and industry leaders, including former CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam, Coinbase legal executive Ryan VanGrack, Multicoin Capital’s Greg Xethalis, and Wharton School’s Sarah Hammer. Lummis pointed to the scheduling of multiple competing committee meetings as a possible reason for the poor turnout but expressed concern about the lack of bipartisan engagement on digital asset legislation. (Source: US Senate Banking Committee ) The hearing focused on the development of a Senate bill, which goal is to establish a clear market structure for digital assets, building on the recent passage of the GENIUS Act, a bipartisan stablecoin bill. Despite the earlier cooperative momentum, Lummis raised questions about the growing partisanship surrounding crypto legislation. She hinted at potential political motivations, and suggested that concerns over certain administration members’ family ties to the crypto industry might be influencing Democratic resistance. Democratic Senator Angela Alsobrooks was the only member from her party present at the hearing, filling in for Ranking Member Ruben Gallego. Alsobrooks supported the GENIUS Act and played a role in advancing it. Meanwhile, Republican Senator Bernie Moreno echoed concerns about why crypto legislation has become such a partisan issue, although no direct references were made to President Donald Trump or specific people in the administration. The Senate’s proposed digital asset market structure legislation complements parallel efforts in the House, where the CLARITY Act was recently moved out of committee and is expected to be put to a floor vote. While several Democrats previously voted alongside Republicans to advance the GENIUS Act, the broader debate over crypto regulation in Congress is still very much colored by political suspicion and questions of transparency. Trump Eyes Action Against Crypto Debanking Despite the rising political tensions, the Trump administration is reportedly considering issuing an executive order to prevent banks from cutting off services to politically disfavored industries, including cryptocurrency firms. According to a report from The Wall Street Journal, the proposed move is in response to concerns that financial institutions have been selectively denying services to crypto and tech entrepreneurs in what critics have labeled “Operation Chokepoint 2.0.” The alleged debanking campaign began under former President Joe Biden’s administration, with at least 30 technology and crypto founders reportedly affected. Major banks like JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo recently met with state officials in Texas and Oklahoma to address allegations of discrimination against industries like firearms manufacturing and fossil fuels. Naturally, the issue attracted a lot of bipartisan attention. In February, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren urged the Trump administration to intervene after saying that no one should be denied banking access based on political views or industry affiliation. The topic gained renewed urgency after the collapse of three crypto-friendly banks—Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate Bank, and Signature Bank—between March 10 and 12, 2023. These closures prompted venture capitalist Nic Carter to characterize the situation as a coordinated attempt to marginalize the crypto industry, dubbing it “Operation Chokepoint 2.0.” Despite a seemingly more supportive stance from the Trump administration, there are still some concerns from within the crypto industry. Caitlin Long , CEO of Custodia Bank, explained that the debanking trend may persist until at least 2026. She pointed out that Trump will not be able to appoint a new Federal Reserve governor until January, which could potentially limit the administration’s influence. Long added that if agencies like the OCC and FDIC roll back their anti-crypto stances but the Fed does not, regulatory uncertainty could continue to hamper the industry. Long’s own bank, Custodia, suffered due to these banking restrictions by losing both time and money. Trump did, however, reaffirmed his plans to end the practice during his comments at the White House Crypto Summit on March 7. Federal Reserve Ends Support for Crypto Debanking Meanwhile, the US Federal Reserve announced a major policy shift by directing its supervisors to stop considering “reputational risk” in the oversight of banks. This is a big win for the cryptocurrency industry, which has long argued that the ambiguous concept of reputational risk was used to justify the debanking of crypto firms under Operation Chokepoint 2.0. In its statement, the Federal Reserve Board said it started reviewing its supervisory materials to remove references to reputational risk and replace them with more specific discussions focused on financial risk. The central bank also plans to train its examiners accordingly and ensure the change is consistently applied across all banks it supervises. Additionally, the Fed is working with other federal banking regulators to promote uniform practices across the regulatory landscape. Despite this move, the Fed clarified that banks are still expected to maintain strong risk management systems and comply with all applicable laws and regulations. The change does not prevent banks from considering reputational risk in their internal risk frameworks; it simply removes the concept from supervisory guidance. The Federal Reserve defined reputational risk as the potential for damage due to negative publicity—accurate or not—that could lead to customer loss, litigation, or revenue decline. The move drew praise from both crypto advocates and banking industry leaders. Senator Cynthia Lummis described the previous reputation risk policy as one that “assassinated American Bitcoin and digital asset businesses,” and called the reversal a win, albeit one that requires more action. Rob Nichols, CEO of the American Bankers Association, also supported the change by saying it would make bank supervision more transparent and grounded in sound financial principles rather than regulatory subjectivity. However, not everyone welcomed the decision. Critics argued that removing reputational risk from oversight could downplay non-financial concerns that affect bank stability, weaken overall supervision, and open the door to potentially riskier practices. This policy shift happened as part of the broader rollback of crypto restrictions by US regulators. In May, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency confirmed that banks under its oversight are allowed to trade crypto and outsource related services. Similarly, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation clarified in March that banks can now engage in crypto-related activities without requiring prior approval.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9695/senators-skip-key-crypto-hearing-as-political-divides-deepen,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

An Analysis Company CEO Comments! “I Can’t Guarantee Anything, But…”","Cryptocurrency analysis firm Alphractal and its CEO Joao Wedson have suggested that a strong altcoin season could be experienced in the third quarter of 2025, drawing attention to the increasing stablecoin liquidity and Bitcoin dominance in the market. According to Alphractal’s analysis, the stablecoin market has been experiencing significant growth in recent weeks. With a total market value approaching $250 billion, stablecoins currently account for around 7.5% of the global cryptocurrency market, with Tether (USDT) taking the largest share. USDT represents more than 66% of all stablecoins. On the other hand, the total market dominance of Bitcoin and stablecoins reached 73.5%. According to experts, this rate is historically considered as the forerunner of a strong accumulation and rise period for the altcoin market. Related News: SEC Issues Update on Anticipated Altcoin Spot ETF – Here's What You Need to Know The company’s CEO, Joao Wedson, claimed that contrary to the negative expectations for the altcoin market, the current conditions have serious potential for growth. According to Wedson, while the majority of investors are still keeping their distance from the altcoin market, the large liquidity available could lead to a surprise rally by turning to these assets. Despite the cautious mood in the market, the Alphractal team believes that a parabolic rally in altcoins is possible starting in the summer of 2025. *This is not investment advice.

While altcoins display stability after rebounding from weekend lows, Arbitrum protocol is in the spotlight after generating $1.42 million in revenue within the last seven days. EntropyAdvisor’s dune dashboard reveals these stats, showing a 23% surge from the previous week. Source: Entropyadvisors The impressive earnings place ARB’s blockchain among the economically viable and active Ethereum L2 ecosystems. This article evaluates how real-world asset (RAW) trends drive Arbitrum’s growth. RAW activity on Arbitrum hits ATHs The network has seen impressive performance over the past week, with its RWA sector hitting new all-time highs above $300 million. RWA protocols bridge decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional finance (TradiFi). They allow individuals to access tokenized versions of real-world assets like bonds, invoices, and real estate on dApps. Economists believe the tokenization sector will be a $16 trillion market by 2030, while others expect tremendous growth to $30 trillion in the next five years. In that context, Arbitrum’s attracting $300 million into this industry demonstrates an increasing appetite among builders and investors to onboard real-world use cases into blockchain systems. Moreover, the milestone confirms Arbitrum’s capability to support low-fee, scalable RWA applications. Furthermore, the impressive RWA adoption reflects magnified investor trust in L2 platforms that offer regulated, yield-bearing, and scalable on-chain financial instruments. The soaring RWA activity possibly fueled on-chain volumes and transaction fees, boosting ARB’s protocol revenue. Ecosystem players propel Arbitrum’s boom Various protocols contributed to Arbitrum’s revenue spike in the past few sessions, highlighting the expanding Arbitrum DeFi landscape. GMX, Ostium Labs, and Gains Network led the charge, earning $550K, $225K, and $120K, respectively. Pendle and Uniswap followed with $85K and $82K. According to Web3 enthusiast Isaac Bassey: These numbers reflect not only strong user activity but also the increasing sophistication of Arbitrum’s ecosystem, which is rapidly evolving with innovative protocols and scaling solutions. The flourishing ecosystem protocols aren’t just facilitating on-chain transactions but also building a revolutionary financial infrastructure. ARB price outlook Arbitrum’s native token exhibited a bullish structure on its daily chart, driven by broad-based recoveries and optimistic ecosystem updates. ARB trades at $0.3149 after touching an intraday high of $0.3334. Chart by Coinmarketcap While bulls fight for short-term control, the alt gas struggled with bearishness lately, down 20% and 60% in the previous month and year. The downside is visible as Arbitrum investors have struggled with losses despite various developers’ efforts to rescue the project from deep slides. However, the prevailing trends suggest impending shifts. As retail and institutional investors join the RWA bandwagon, platforms like Arbitrum stand to enjoy massive benefits. Arbitrum’s status as a scalable Ethereum L2 makes it lucrative for supporting more complex fiscal products, including those linked to off-chain assets. Such a trajectory could make Arbitrum the go-to blockchain for DeFi integration with RWA.

2025-06-25T05:00:38,"Tron’s 374% Profit-Taking Spree Uncovered—Here’s Who Was Behind It","On-chain data shows Tron (TRX) observed a large profit-taking spike earlier in the month. Which type of holder was responsible for the move? Tron SOPR Saw A Huge Spike Earlier In The Month In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, analyst Maartunn has talked about the recent trend in the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) of Tron. The SOPR refers to an on-chain indicator that tells us about whether the TRX investors are moving or selling their coins at a profit or loss. The indicator works by going through the transfer history of each coin being moved to see what price it was last transacted at. Coins that have this cost basis above the current spot price are contributing to loss realization, while those with the opposite setup to profit realization. Related Reading: Crypto Bears Rekt: $359M Gone As Bitcoin, Ethereum Rebound The SOPR takes the ratio between the spent value and cost basis, and sums it up for all coins being sold on the blockchain to find a net situation for the market as a whole. When the value of the indicator is greater than 1, it means the investors are, on average, realizing a profit through their transactions. On the other hand, the metric being under this threshold suggests the dominance of loss realization in the market. Now, here is the chart shared by the quant that shows the trend in the Tron SOPR over the past year: As displayed in the above graph, the Tron SOPR saw a huge spike above the 1 mark earlier in the month, implying investors took part in a significant amount of profit-taking. From the chart, it’s also visible that there were other profit realization spikes during the past year, but the current one stands out for its scale. The latest peak in the metric saw its value go to 4.74, corresponding to a profit margin of 374%. “With TRX priced at $0.268 at the time, the average acquisition price for those coins would have been around $0.0566,” explains Maartunn. Interestingly, Tron hasn’t seen extended periods around this price mark since late 2022, meaning that the tokens would have been held for a good while before being finally transacted this month. Usually, when dormant hands break their silence, it’s likely to be for selling-related purposes. That said, it’s not the only reason they may do so. “The activity could be tied to early investors realizing gains, internal transfers, or reallocation decisions,” notes the analyst. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Zone Could Be Market’s Next True ‘Pivot,’ Says Glassnode In some other news, the USDT supply on the Tron network has reached a new milestone, as institutional DeFi solutions provider Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) has pointed out in an X post.

2025-06-25T05:00:32,"21 Years Later: Michael Saylor Sees Bitcoin At $21 Million—Details","A steady drumbeat of policy updates and big-money moves has kept Bitcoin in the headlines this month. According to keynotes delivered at BTC Prague 2025 , the cryptocurrency’s path is now being drawn in decades—rather than days. Geopolitical And Regulatory Push Based on reports from Strategy’s executive offices, US regulators have taken a friendlier turn since July 2024. New cabinet roles now include digital asset advisers. The SEC, OCC, and Federal Reserve have each signaled that Bitcoin plays a role in modern finance. Congress has also weighed the Bitcoin Act and Clarity Act, and those talks are still underway. Institutions Pile In With Billions According to recent filings, more than $150 billion of fresh capital has flowed into crypto holdings. Institutional wallets now hold around 1.4 million BTC. Public companies in the “Bitcoin 100” club include US President’s Donald Trump Media, GameStop, SmarterWeb, and Metaplanet. ETF approvals have added 10 new ways for both small investors and big firms to buy Bitcoin. Long-Term Forecast Anchored In Math Now, here’s the most interesting part: Michael Saylor outlined a 21-year outlook that ties BTC value to global money trends instead of quick trades. He set a target of $21 million per coin by 2046. By that time, owning 4.8 Bitcoin could turn someone into a centaillionaire , based on simple math. Saylor pointed out a 56% annual return over the last five years. He compared that to a 13% cost of capital for many firms. DCA Strategies Vs. Traditional Holding Based on reports from Strategy’s research team , a $2 million dollar-cost averaging plan in Bitcoin would have grown to $40 million. The same $2 million parked in the S&P500 would be worth about $6 million today. Add in smart borrowing through equity issuance, Saylor said, and the upside climbs to $760 million—if markets cooperate. Volatility, he noted, is part of Bitcoin’s early life cycle. Companies should lock in low-rate funding and plan for price swings. Markets can move fast, and falling values often trigger margin calls. The coming months will test whether policy stays warm and big investors keep their faith. For now, Bitcoin’s story is shifting toward a multi-decade saga of adoption, regulation, and big bets. Will It Happen? Investors will be watching each Fed statement and corporate balance sheet near as much as they watch price charts. They may take the proverbial grain of salt on Saylor’s $21 million per Bitcoin by 2046. But many say the real story isn’t the $21 million figure itself. It’s the steady march of new rules and big names piling into Bitcoin that could shape its future far more than any single price forecast. Investors will be tuning in to every policy update and balance-sheet reveal, looking for signs that this decades-long experiment can keep gaining ground.

2025-06-25T05:00:00,"The Future of DAG in Finance? BlockDAG Innovative Model Explained!","Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) chains have gained attention over the last few years for solving major blockchain issues. Kaspa, for example, offers quick confirmations and high throughput. But most DAG networks haven’t moved beyond speed. The real challenge is getting these networks used in DeFi, payments, and global money transfers. BlockDAG (BDAG) steps in to close that gap. It’s using a mix of DAG structure and Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus. Add to that EVM compatibility and a plan focused on real-world finance, and BlockDAG becomes more than just another fast chain. It’s setting up the tools to support real payments, daily transactions, and on-chain financial activity where many others have stopped short. BlockDAG Adds What Other DAG Chains Don’t Kaspa and other DAG networks fix issues like slow block times and limited throughput. But most of them stop at the infrastructure level. They rarely move beyond the protocol layer. That’s why usage remains small despite solid tech. BlockDAG takes a wider approach. It combines DAG speed with missing pieces that other projects skipped: PoW to maintain decentralization and network security EVM support so Ethereum developers can join in A no-code builder for easy dApp creation Tools for DeFi like DEXs, bridges, and oracles This setup isn’t just about building a fast network. It’s about creating a blockchain that can handle real financial traffic. Why BlockDAG Is Building Before Listing BlockDAG’s roadmap focuses on putting financial tools into the Layer 1 core. Starting in Q4 2025, and just two weeks before it hits exchanges, key DeFi components will go live: A built-in DEX Lending and borrowing platforms On-chain indexers and oracles Multi-chain bridge for liquidity between networks These features aren’t planned for the distant future. They’re part of a six-week rollout set to begin right before price discovery starts. While most chains wait until after listing to build, BlockDAG is pushing development ahead of time. Its long-term goal is even more ambitious. BlockDAG aims to become a settlement layer for real-time payments, international transfers, and routing trades on DEXs. It’s the part many fast chains have missed, turning speed into real utility. The Power of Combining PoW Security With DAG Speed BlockDAG combines the secure PoW model from Bitcoin with DAG’s ability to process in parallel. That means it can handle thousands of transactions per second without losing security. This is key for financial tasks. On regular Layer 1 chains, validators bundle transactions to save time, but that adds delays. BlockDAG’s system avoids this by confirming transactions in parallel. PoW ensures trust and prevents manipulation. This setup is ideal for: Crypto payments in stores Quick foreign exchange transfers Small cross-border DeFi transactions Instant trade routing on DEXs These aren’t just ideas on paper. If BlockDAG sticks to its current pace, these use cases could become reality by mid-2026. Daily Growth Continues as $0.0020 Offer Nears Its End BlockDAG has already raised $320.5 million in its presale. So far, 23.2 billion coins have been sold. Over 2 million users have joined the X1 app, which allows mining from their phones. More than 18,173 miners have also been sold. The X30 and X100 miners will ship starting July 7. X10 devices will be shipped from August 15. This isn’t just marketing. This shows how the project is turning funds into working tools. With this much support, BlockDAG can grow its builder base, launch financial layers, and keep high-speed performance. BlockDAG’s pricing approach also draws interest. Batch 29 is set at $0.0276, but there’s a special presale rate of $0.0020 running for a short time. That’s much lower than the confirmed $0.05 launch price, meaning early buyers from Batch 1 have already seen 2,660% gains. The presale, currently offering this limited price of $0.0020, is pulling in new retail buyers daily. It’s set to increase to $0.0030 in just a few hours. What’s Next? Most DAG-based platforms focus on speed. BlockDAG goes beyond that. It’s building an entire system on top of that speed, made for crypto finance. The roadmap is clear. Tools are already working. The financial layer is scheduled to launch right before the coin hits exchanges. That kind of planning is rare. And it’s what makes BlockDAG stand out for anyone looking at real blockchain use. If it stays on track, BlockDAG could do what no other DAG chain has done: turn great tech into tools people use every day. It may even go further than Kaspa, by offering not just speed but real financial applications that work at scale. Because speed helps. But speed with function is what changes everything.

Ledger NBA Sponsorship: A Game-Changing Alliance This alliance between a pioneering crypto hardware wallet company and a storied NBA franchise like the San Antonio Spurs marks a significant milestone. For years, the cryptocurrency space has sought avenues for broader recognition and integration into everyday life. This partnership provides exactly that – a highly visible platform within one of the most popular sports leagues globally. The Spurs, known for their disciplined play and consistent success, now align themselves with a company synonymous with digital asset security, bridging two seemingly disparate worlds. It’s a testament to the growing legitimacy and pervasive influence of the crypto economy. The Power of Crypto Hardware Wallet Security At the heart of this partnership is Ledger, a name synonymous with robust digital asset protection. For those new to the space, a crypto hardware wallet is a physical device that stores your private keys offline, making them virtually immune to online hacks and malware. Ledger’s devices, like the Nano S Plus or Nano X, are designed to give users complete control and ultimate security over their Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital currencies.

2025-06-25T04:50:00,"BNB Corporate Treasury to Be Created by a New Firm Raising $100 Million","Former Coral Capital executives aim to raise $100M via a Nasdaq shell company to accumulate BNB as a treasury asset. VanEck recently filed for the first-ever BNB ETF in the US, including staking rewards. Technical indicators suggest short-term downside risk for BNB, but long-term fundamentals are strengthening rapidly. A new venture led by three former Coral Capital executives, Patrick Horsman, Joshua Kruger, and Jonathan Pasch, is raising $100 million to create a publicly-traded company that will accumulate BNB tokens as its primary treasury reserve asset. The move mirrors the well-known Bitcoin strategy of Michael Saylor’s company, Strategy, and signals growing institutional interest in major Layer 1 tokens beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. The new company, to be named Build & Build Corporation, will be formed through a Nasdaq-listed shell company. While Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) clarified on X that he has no direct involvement, the development could serve as a catalyst for other corporations to consider BNB as a reserve asset.

2025-06-25T04:14:26,"Metaplanet Pulls in Over $500M on Day One of ‘555 Million Bitcoin’ Plan","Metaplanet, the Japanese investment firm undergoing a bold pivot toward Bitcoin, raised more than $517m on the first day of its sweeping “555 Million Plan,” signaling strong early momentum behind one of Asia’s largest crypto-focused capital raises. According to a company filing on Wednesday, the funding was secured through the issuance of 54m new shares after EVO Fund exercised a portion of its stock acquisition rights. Metaplanet aims to raise as much as $5.4b through its 555m Plan, with the goal of acquiring 210,000 Bitcoin by the end of 2027, roughly 1% of the total supply. Metaplanet Raises $517.8M in First Tranche of 555 Million Bitcoin Plan As part of this effort, shares were issued at ¥1,388 each, or about $9.59, generating around ¥74.9b, or $517.8m. The issuance accounts for about 10% of the total 555m shares the company plans to release. 10% of the 555 Million Plan executed on Day 1. ¥74.9B ($0.5B+) raised. https://t.co/53bjAT6Egm — Simon Gerovich (@gerovich) June 25, 2025 This initial funding round follows Metaplanet’s recent board approval to commit up to $5b to its US subsidiary. The unit, Metaplanet Treasury Corp, is based in Florida. Going forward, the American arm will manage Bitcoin acquisition and treasury operations. It will also tap into deeper US capital markets and institutional infrastructure to support the company’s global strategy. If Fully Executed, Plan Would Place Metaplanet Among Largest Bitcoin-Holding Firms Metaplanet is following a strategy similar to that of US-based MicroStrategy , which has acquired over 1% of Bitcoin’s total supply through equity raises. Now, Metaplanet aims to replicate that approach from the Asia-Pacific region. It hopes to position itself as a digital asset leader within Japanese capital markets. According to the company, 96% of funds raised will go toward Bitcoin purchases. The remaining amount will be used for bond redemptions and yield-generating strategies. Following Monday’s issuance, Metaplanet’s total outstanding shares climbed to over 654m. If fully executed, the 555m Plan could make Metaplanet one of the world’s largest corporate holders of Bitcoin. This would give the firm significant influence in the fast-growing digital asset economy.

2025-06-25T04:00:21,"Could MAGACOIN FINANCE’s Final Presale Stage Attract XRP and Bitcoin Investors Eyeing Arbitrum?","As 2025’s digital asset cycle heats up, capital is rotating into early-stage opportunities that offer sharper upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE has now emerged as a serious contender during its final pre-sale phase. With Bitcoin and XRP holders shifting strategies and Arbitrum’s rebound catching interest, all eyes are on whether this altcoin becomes the next breakout rotation play . MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Focal Point for Strategic Capital MAGACOIN FINANCE has passed the $10 million fundraising milestone with each phase selling out at an accelerating pace. With a capped supply , a verified HashEx audit , and a community-first, VC-free model , the project is defining scarcity-backed momentum. Its appeal is driven by community support—most participants are accumulating and staking, indicating long-term confidence. Its listing prospects have drawn comparisons to early giants like Solana and Ethereum, positioning it as a rare opportunity before the broader market catches on. XRP: Rotating for Faster Upside XRP’s momentum has cooled slightly in recent weeks, prompting traders to look for newer, faster-moving vehicles. MAGACOIN FINANCE has drawn strong interest from XRP holders searching for greater near-term ROI potential and clearer upside catalysts during this quarter. Bitcoin: Profits Fueling Rotational Plays As Bitcoin consolidates above $105,000 , high-cap traders are reallocating profits into pre-launch opportunities. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out for its tokenomics, grassroots appeal, and timing—making it an attractive target for rotation without departing from strong fundamentals. Arbitrum: Building Back for Long-Term Arbitrum (ARB) has begun to recover following a turbulent spring. While long-term forecasts are optimistic, many investors are looking elsewhere for faster price movement. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s pre-launch format is proving to be a compelling hedge for those seeking action now rather than later. Conclusion With its final presale window open and momentum shifting, MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming a strategic choice for XRP and Bitcoin traders alike. As Arbitrum rebuilds and attention focuses on high-reward opportunities, this project is fast gaining reputation as a leading early-stage opportunity in 2025.

Open interest has also climbed to $70.5 million. The CME Group announced its XRP futures in April to expand its crypto derivatives lineup, which already includes Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. The XRP contracts come in two sizes, standard (50,000 XRP) and micro (2,500 XRP). Both are cash-settled and based on the CME CF XRP-Dollar Reference Rate. Spot XRP ETF Next? This is important because the SEC has previously stressed the need for a regulated futures market when approving spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.

MAGACOIN FINANCE and SEI are now attracting attention from Solana and Bitcoin investors, while Ethereum’s ecosystem keeps a close eye on their momentum. Analysts are flagging both as strategic accumulation zones in the months ahead. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Top Accumulation Zone of Q3 MAGACOIN FINANCE has positioned itself as one of the most compelling early-stage projects in 2025. With a fully audited structure, capped supply, and no VC control, it combines transparency with disciplined execution. Its presale has generated considerable demand, setting a precedent for community-led, scarcity-driven tokens. Backed by strong staking utility and a committed user base, MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to build momentum as a credible contender in the altcoin landscape. Solana: Institutional Strength and ETF Optimism Solana’s expanding ecosystem and potential ETF approval have amplified institutional interest. Despite its robust fundamentals, many early investors are diversifying into tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE to access untapped, pre-listing opportunities. This shift reflects a broader strategy of capturing asymmetric upside before large-scale adoption. Bitcoin: Market Anchor, Rotating for Upside Bitcoin remains the market’s foundation, but as its growth stabilizes, investors are reallocating toward early-stage opportunities. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a preferred target, combining structure and sentiment in a market eager for the next strong performer. SEI: Under-the-Radar with Strong Signals SEI is quietly evolving, with traction growing across tokenization and decentralized science sectors. While some uncertainties remain, its development pace and recent performance suggest it’s gaining recognition among forward-looking traders. Ethereum: Observing the Shift Ethereum’s community is closely tracking these developments. With smart contract compatibility and historical parallels to its early growth, Ethereum’s ecosystem views MAGACOIN FINANCE and SEI as aligned with the type of high-upside stories that defined its own rise.

2025-06-25T03:00:59,"Bitcoin Poised For Rally As Geopolitical Tensions Ease And Inflation Expectations Fall","Leading crypto exchange Binance witnessed a significant outflow of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) on June 23, with investors pulling out over 4,000 BTC and 61,000 ETH in a single day. This shift comes amid easing geopolitical tensions and declining inflation, fuelling speculation about a renewed rally. Bitcoin Likely To Rally As Global Tensions Simmer According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Amr Taha, Bitcoin is likely to resume its upward trajectory, bolstered by a series of recent macroeconomic and geopolitical developments. The analyst highlighted multiple positive signals that could propel the top digital asset closer to its all-time high (ATH). Related Reading: Bitcoin Yearly Trend Suggests Cycle Top Near $205,000 By Year-End, Analyst Says One of the key developments was an announcement by US President Donald Trump, who stated that a ceasefire agreement had been reached between Israel and Iran. This deal removes the immediate threat of Iran closing the Strait of Hormuz, a vital chokepoint for global oil supply. The ceasefire had an immediate and positive effect on global equity markets, with the S&P 500 index surpassing 6,000 for the first time since February 2025. This recovery signals growing investor confidence as geopolitical risks subside. In addition, crude oil prices dropped by 14%, adding to the disinflationary narrative. Lower energy costs help reduce production and transportation expenses, thereby supporting a broader decline in inflationary pressures. Taha concluded: The convergence of significant crypto outflows from Binance, falling oil prices, a bullish breakout in US equities, and the reduction of Middle Eastern tensions presents a striking scenario. With the geopolitical overhang removed, inflation easing, and macro markets stabilizing, Bitcoin is now well-positioned to resume its upward trajectory. Meanwhile, Bitcoin whales – wallets holding large amounts of BTC – appear to be quietly accumulating in anticipation of a breakout. In another CryptoQuant post, contributor Mignolet noted that whale accumulation has been rising steadily since BTC bottomed in April. Mignolet pointed out that whale activity typically increases during periods of low market attention or heightened fear, often foreshadowing bullish reversals. Historical data supports this trend, showing that increased accumulation often precedes significant price surges. Bullish Quarter For BTC In an X post published today, seasoned crypto analyst Titan of Crypto stated that BTC is set to close a bullish monthly candle, reinforcing the long-term uptrend for the flagship cryptocurrency. Several other on-chain and technical indicators also suggest further upside potential. For example, Bitcoin Binary CDD shows that long-term holders are continuing to hold rather than sell, indicating strong conviction in BTC’s long-term value. Related Reading: Bitcoin Forming Inverse Head And Shoulders Pattern – Is $150,000 The Next Target? At the same time, the number of short positions is climbing as BTC consolidates between $100,000 and $110,000.

2025-06-25T03:00:16,"Can MAGACOIN FINANCE Outperform XRP? Bitcoin and Ethereum Traders Bet Big on Kaspa","In today’s competitive digital asset space, investors are always on the lookout for early-stage opportunities with high-return potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE is now emerging as one of the strongest contenders—often referred to as the best altcoin opportunity currently available. With growing buzz from XRP veterans and shifting capital from Bitcoin and Ethereum communities, attention is also building around Kaspa’s unique blockchain utility. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The New Contender for Explosive Gains MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly gaining recognition for its fundamentals: a permanently capped 170 billion token supply, a full HashEx audit, and a structure built entirely on community ownership. Over $10 million raised and consecutive pre-sale rounds selling out have positioned it as contender for the best crypto to buy in 2025 . Its transparent governance, inflation resistance, and aggressive marketing strategy have led many analysts to draw parallels to past altcoin giants. Many XRP holders are shifting capital here, confident in its asymmetric upside and fast-growing momentum. XRP: Legendary Past, Challenging Present XRP remains a household name due to its historic rallies, but present regulatory overhang and slowed price movement above $2.50 have pushed many long-term holders to explore new, dynamic assets. MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming a popular destination for those rebalancing for sharper upside. Bitcoin & Ethereum: Rotating Capital into Kaspa While Bitcoin trades above $105,000 and Ethereum maintains market dominance, seasoned investors are increasingly rotating into smaller-cap projects. Kaspa has emerged as a favorite due to its unique tech stack, GHOSTDAG protocol, and fast-growing user base. Kaspa: The Technological Standout Kaspa’s architecture enables high throughput, fast confirmations, and wide utility across applications. With rising trading volumes and developer interest, it’s quickly positioning itself as one of the most advanced blockchain platforms in the current cycle. Conclusion As crypto capital rotates and sentiment shifts, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining a foothold among early movers. With strong fundamentals, rising interest, and favorable comparisons to past winners, it stands out as a compelling candidate to outperform XRP.

2025-06-25T02:30:15,"Is MAGACOIN FINANCE Set to Become the Next Ethereum? XRP and Bitcoin Traders Eyeing Solana","With market cycles evolving, investors are watching closely for projects capable of matching Ethereum’s early success. MAGACOIN FINANCE is fast emerging as a prime candidate, catching the attention of seasoned XRP, Bitcoin, and Solana traders looking to enter a scalable, early-stage opportunity before the listing window closes. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Poised for Ethereum-Level Breakout MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining momentum on the strength of fundamentals—scarcity, decentralization, and transparency. With a capped 170 billion token supply, full audit, and no VC control, the project appeals to both retail and institutional investors. Analysts highlight its breakout potential, estimating returns between 75x and 100x, projecting it as the best crypto since the early runs of XRP and Bitcoin (BTC). XRP and Bitcoin: Strategic Rotations in Play XRP remains a dominant force in payments, but as legal uncertainties stall price progress, many of its holders are seeking higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities. MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly the destination for that capital. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s price hovers above $105,000 with stability, but its slower upside has driven many early BTC adopters to rotate partial profits into promising low-cap assets—MAGACOIN FINANCE among the top of that list. Solana: Mature Growth, New Opportunity Needed Solana’s price strength and network improvements continue, but as momentum normalizes, many SOL traders are pivoting to smaller projects with asymmetric upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s surge in community interest and credibility has positioned it as a leading beneficiary. Conclusion From XRP to Solana holders, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly becoming the standout altcoin of 2025. As listing approaches, the time for early action is now. Momentum continues to build as analysts forecast exponential upside. Early buyers are positioning before the wider market catches on.

2025-06-25T02:00:16,"Bitcoin Exchange Activity Declines as Accumulation Patterns Persist","Following a weekend dip, Bitcoin has reclaimed the $100,000 price mark, signaling renewed short-term strength amid geopolitical tensions. As of the time of writing, BTC is trading at $105,323, up by 4% in the last 24 hours. The price recovery arrives in broader investor sentiment shifts, both in on-chain behavior and exchange activity. A recent analysis from CryptoQuant’s analyst Darkfost sheds light on a multi-year transition among Bitcoin holders. The analyst observes that fewer Bitcoin addresses are depositing coins onto exchanges, a trend that has persisted since the end of the 2021 market cycle. This declining activity may not necessarily suggest fading interest in BTC, but rather a transformation in how investors interact with the asset, potentially hinting at longer-term strategies becoming the norm. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Drop Below $100k Sparks Bearish Chatter, But Data Says Something Else Decline in Exchange Deposits Suggests Structural Market Shift According to Darkfost, between 2015 and 2021, the number of Bitcoin addresses depositing funds to exchanges steadily increased, peaking at an annual average of around 180,000. However, this upward trend has reversed sharply in the years since. The 10-year moving average now hovers around 90,000, while the 30-day average has fallen to 48,000. Most recently, the daily figure dropped to just 37,000. Darkfost mentioned: This reflects a significant behavioral change among BTC investors, which can likely be attributed to several key factors : – One major factor is the arrival of ETFs, which allow exposure to Bitcoin’s price performance without the complexity or risk of directly managing the asset. Additionally, the current market cycle has seen relatively low retail participation, which historically contributed to exchange deposits. More notably, an increasing number of investors, ranging from individuals to institutions, are treating Bitcoin as a long-term store of value or treasury reserve asset rather than a short-term speculative vehicle. The CryptoQuant analyst added: These shifts, which have emerged gradually over time, are precisely what drive Bitcoin’s evolving identity in financial markets. It may well be this transformation that ultimately solidifies BTC’s role as a store of value. Bitcoin Whale Accumulation Patterns Emerge Amid Lower Volume In a separate analysis, another CryptoQuant analyst, Mignolet, focused on activity by large holders on the Bybit exchange. He highlighted that as general market interest and trading volume diminish, the trading patterns of whales become more visible. Mignolet noted that previous periods of reduced sentiment and low volume often saw significant whale accumulation, which historically preceded upward price movements. Related Reading: Bitcoin Repeats Its 2021 Pattern—Analyst Warns Final Crash Still Ahead This pattern, according to Mignolet, appears to be repeating. Since Bitcoin’s local bottom in April, consistent accumulation by large entities has been observed on Bybit. He suggested this could be a signal of underlying market confidence, particularly when retail activity is minimal. While not a guaranteed forecast, historical parallels imply that such behavior may again precede broader price strength, lending weight to ongoing consolidation as a potential setup for future momentum.

2025-06-25T01:53:12,"NYSE Arca to list Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs","The New York Stock Exchange’s digital arm, NYSE Arca, has filed with regulators seeking to list a new Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund (ETF). The filing, dated Tuesday and filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), is for listing the Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, a fund that would invest 75% of its assets in Bitcoin and 25% in Ethereum. The ETF filing from Trump Media comes just eight days after the firm behind the SPAC filed its prospectus with the official CT attorney general, Yorkville America, representing a significant ramp of the company’s crypto strategy. Trump Media, which is majority-owned by President Donald Trump, has recently shifted into high gear in promoting financial products tied to blockchain technologies that can afford the public a taste of crypto via regulated investment vehicles. If approved, the filing would be the second related to a Truth Social-branded ETF in less than a month. The first, Truth Social Bitcoin ETF, submitted its filing in early June, and it was Bitcoin only. Both filings emphasize TMTG’s goal to establish itself as more than a social media and media streaming brand, betting instead that it can be taken seriously in the crypto finance space. Crypto.com to manage and secure ETF operations TMTG and Yorkville America have partnered with Crypto.com, a top-tier exchange, to manage the ETF’s deep-tech infrastructure. Crypto.com will provide digital asset custody , act as the execution agent for crypto transactions, and ensure liquidity for smooth fund operations. In the filing with the SEC, NYSE Arca explained that the proposed listing would attempt to comply with the relevant regulations. “The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices in that the shares will be listed and traded on the exchange under the initial and continued listing criteria in NYSE,” the filing read. This proposal falls under the SEC’s 19b-4 rule change process, which exchanges use when they propose to offer new financial products. The filing is a key regulatory milestone, but does not guarantee approval. The SEC decides whether to allow or reject a listing, typically following public comment and internal review. Trump influence shifts SEC crypto stance The SEC’s position on digital currency seems to be changeable under the incumbent administration of President Donald Trump. The agency, which was once seen as cautious and sometimes skeptical of digital assets, has started to take that more positive view . That tone change comes after several senior SEC positions have been filled, with several appointees seen as sympathetic to the development of crypto markets and increased investor access more generally. Even President Trump has transformed his outlook dramatically. He criticized cryptocurrencies in his first term but has become one of their most outspoken political supporters. Indeed, during recent campaign speeches and public appearances, Trump referred to digital assets as instruments of “financial freedom” and has since integrated blockchain solutions into public policy projects. The increasing political support also gives momentum to Trump Media & Technology Group’s (TMTG) accelerating push into the crypto space. In collaboration with Yorkville America and Crypto.com, it announced the launch of a new suite of blockchain-based financial products under the ”America First.” Some offerings it is considering include the America First Bitcoin Fund, America First Blockchain Leaders Fund, and the America First Stablecoin Income Fund. But so far, just two products, the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF and the Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, have been formally filed with the SEC. The rest are conceptual and have not yet made any regulatory submissions. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

2025-06-25T01:11:52,"Asia Morning Briefing: Analysts Say BTC’s Long-Term Focus Is Easing War Jitters","Good Morning, Asia. Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. After a tense weekend that saw the U.S. bomb an Iranian nuclear site , bitcoin btc has regained its footing, hovering around $106K as Asia begins its Wednesday session and pushing past levels from earlier this month when Israel bombed Iran . Part of the reason why crypto has recovered alongside traditional markets is just how correlated the two have become. ""Bitcoin’s sensitivity to traditional asset classes and macroeconomic indicators has evolved markedly over the past few market cycles, reflecting its growing integration into the broader macro-financial system,"" a recent report from Glassnode and Avenir Group reads. ""Institutional infrastructure has reshaped how capital engages with bitcoin. As a result, its market behavior is increasingly governed by structural liquidity, long-horizon positioning, and regulated access points."" That institutional backbone was visible again this week. Semir Gabeljic, director of capital formation and investment strategy at Pythagoras Investments, cited ETF flows as a major tailwind: ""The huge recent capital inflows in Bitcoin ETFs of $1.1 billion last week and even $350 million today alone"" are driving the positive trend. Spencer Yang, Core Contributor to Fractal Bitcoin, added that one of the reasons why BTC was able to shake off war jitters so quickly is that fundamentally, nothing has changed about the asset class due to the conflict in the Middle East. All the metrics that investors would look to for BTC are still there, and other bullish market sentiment is possibly on the way. “We’re seeing continued interest in protocols like BRC-20, especially with the recent upgrade, as well as Runes and Alkanes, which have been getting a lot of attention,"" he added. ""So overall, on‑chain activity across the board is increasing thanks to these types of assets.” The takeaway? As bitcoin becomes increasingly defined by institutional demand and macro liquidity cycles, analysts see its price action as less about reacting to headlines and more about long-term capital commitment. This structural shift is what continues to anchor BTC above $100K, despite the noise. Tim Draper: Bitcoin Is Eating Crypto as Innovation Flocks to BTC The Bitcoin blockchain is becoming the new home for crypto innovation, absorbing ideas once exclusive to altcoins, just as Microsoft once consolidated the software revolution under its operating system empire, Tim Draper argued in a recent post on X . Draper pointed to BTC dominance , a metric equivalent to its ""market share,"" rising over 60%,up from 40% after the 2017 boom-bust cycle and 50% following the 2021 peak, as proof that Bitcoin is reasserting control over the broader crypto ecosystem. Much like how Microsoft integrated or cloned early success stories like Lotus 1-2-3, WordPerfect, and PowerPoint to form its software suite, Draper says Bitcoin is now incorporating once-altcoin-exclusive innovations: smart contracts, DeFi, ordinals, and low-cost layer 2s. “All the successful innovations on other platforms are now being ported to Bitcoin,” Draper wrote, calling it an “acceleration” that mirrors Big Tech consolidation. Developers, he said, are increasingly gravitating toward Bitcoin as the most secure and valuable chain. Draper, who runs a Bitcoin-focused accelerator with Boost VC, said the next generation of entrepreneurs is building on Bitcoin not just for ideological reasons, but because the infrastructure and ecosystem are now ready. “Smart entrepreneurs are always building on the platform with the strongest gravitational pull,” he wrote. “That platform is Bitcoin.” WazirX Granted Extension to Present Revised Restructuring Plan WazirX has received a court-approved extension from the Singapore High Court , allowing it to present further arguments in support of its proposed Scheme of Arrangement. The court also extended the moratorium on creditor actions, which will now remain in place until a ruling is issued on the revised plan. In a statement released Monday, the exchange said it is awaiting further directions from the court and reiterated its commitment to resolving outstanding claims. The company’s original restructuring plan, rejected by the court last month, as CoinDesk previously reported , sought to reimburse users affected by a $234 million hack in July 2024 through the issuance of recovery tokens and a transfer of operations to a new entity, Zensui Corporation. More than 93% of creditors had approved the initial plan, but the court cited concerns around governance and transparency. Without an approved arrangement, WazirX faces the possibility of liquidation under Singapore’s Companies Act, which could lead to extended delays and reduced creditor recoveries. No date has been set for the next court hearing. Market Movements BTC: Bitcoin surged past $106,000 after a ceasefire between Israel and Iran eased geopolitical tensions, triggering a breakout fueled by high-conviction buyers, bullish technical signals, and strong on-chain accumulation, while the broader CD20 index also climbed nearly 1% amid renewed market strength. ETH: Ethereum surged 4% to break above $2,450 as Trump’s announcement of an Israel-Iran ceasefire eased global tensions, triggering renewed institutional accumulation and strong on-chain buying momentum. Gold: Gold fell as much as 2% to $3,300 after Trump’s surprise Israel-Iran ceasefire announcement eased geopolitical tensions, weakening safe-haven demand even as the metal remains up over 25% year-to-date. Nikkei 225: Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.12% as Asia-Pacific markets opened higher Wednesday, buoyed by the Israel-Iran ceasefire and new signals from the U.S. Federal Reserve. S&P 500: U.S. stocks surged Tuesday, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 hitting their highest levels since February as a tech-led rally gained momentum amid growing optimism over a fragile U.S.-brokered Israel-Iran ceasefire.

While many smaller traders are bracing for more losses, a handful of massive accounts have broken the surface and put millions in a massive show of force. Related Reading: Bitcoin Paces $15 Billion YTD Influx Amid 10-Week Fund Flow Streak Ethereum Whale Bets Surface According to on-chain data, one whale opened a long position worth $101 million at an entry price of $2,247, using 25x leverage. That bet paid off with roughly $950,000 in profit, but it also cost $2.5 million in fees. These numbers show just how high the stakes have become. High Fees Cut Into Gains This whale further withdrew 18,000 $ETH worth $40.38M from #Binance. Now, the whale holds 50,256 $ETH worth $112.62M, currently down $2.24M Address: 0x3952d69643f7a87237c7fc8bb33f8453c0b45500 https://t.co/49vC0iqMZP pic.twitter.com/rF5cX2gsXZ — Onchain Lens (@OnchainLens) June 23, 2025 Based on reports from On-Chain Lens, another whale moved over $40 million in Ether from Binance before opening its own leveraged trade. Combine the two wallets and you’ve got about $112 million riding on an ETH bounce. Yet those $2.5 million in fees highlight the hidden cost of big bets. Middle East Tension Hits Prices ETH slipped to about $2,113 on Sunday, marking its lowest level in 30 days. That drop came after US military strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites. United States President Donald Trump called the operation a “spectacular success” and warned of more action if Iran didn’t back down. Traders say the fallout from those strikes rattled global markets and fed crypto volatility. Retail Traders Watch Closely Retail traders tend to sell when prices drop. But these whales have the scope to weather downswings. Their large purchases indicate that they find value at current levels. Short traders might not agree, however. They’re sitting in many short positions, expecting ETH to decline further before it will rise. What The Whales See Experts say large holders tend to have lower break-even points. They can afford to wait months or years for a payoff. Some also use complex strategies across multiple markets. That makes their moves hard to read from the outside. Still, when you see $112 million on the line, it’s a hint that smart money senses a buying window. Related Reading: Bitcoin Paces $15 Billion YTD Influx Amid 10-Week Fund Flow Streak Risks On Both Sides Leveraged trades amplify gains and losses equally. A 5% drop would trigger a forced sell-off on a 25x position. That could feed a sharp decline in ETH’s price. On the other hand, if the market turns up, those whales could pocket big returns well beyond what retail traders see. Investors will be watching every market swing. If geopolitical tensions cool and big money stays bullish, ETH could find footing above $2,200. But another shock—political or technical—might send the price tumbling again.

Among these, MAGACOIN FINANCE has broken through the $10 million fundraising milestone, catching the eye of Bitcoin, Solana, Ethereum, and Kaspa communities for its impressive trajectory and transparency. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The New Altcoin Magnet MAGACOIN FINANCE has become a standout narrative in today’s altcoin discussions. With over $10 million raised and every offering round selling out rapidly, its fixed 170 billion supply , HashEx audit , and VC-free model have set a high bar for accountability and scarcity. Investors are staking their allocations and holding with conviction, pushing demand toward its public listing at a projected $0.007 . MAGACOIN FINANCE builds on infrastructure, active rewards, and a visible plan—earning comparisons to the early days of DOGE and SHIBA, but with a more robust framework and credibility. Bitcoin: The Foundation, But Seeking Fresh Multiples While Bitcoin remains a store of value trading near $105,000 , its upside is seen as stabilizing. For many holders, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents a tactical pivot toward projects offering exponential ROI potential. Early participants are reallocating portions of capital, hunting multipliers that BTC no longer consistently delivers. Solana: Strong Base, But Traders Eye New Rallies Solana remains strong, backed by ecosystem support and active development. Yet, as price movements level out, attention is shifting. Many SOL holders are turning to MAGACOIN FINANCE , which offers sharper entry points and community-driven momentum missing in larger cap names. Ethereum: Watching for the Next Breakout While Ethereum continues to dominate key market sectors, ETH traders are gradually diversifying. With growth tempered by scaling debates and external policy discussions, newer plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE are offering early exposure to upside cycles reminiscent of Ethereum’s own early rise. Kaspa: Steady Growth, But MAGACOIN FINANCE Offers More Kaspa ’s technical merits and long-term appeal are undisputed, but recent attention has tilted toward MAGACOIN FINANCE , where immediate community action and pre-listing excitement offer shorter-term movement for those seeking early-stage entry points. Conclusion With increasing buy-in from Bitcoin and Solana communities and growing interest from Ethereum and Kaspa holders, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as one of the most closely watched altcoin launches of the year . The momentum is organic, the structure is transparent, and the opportunity—according to traders—is still early.

2025-06-25T00:30:34,"USDB Stablecoin: A Revolutionary Leap for Native Bitcoin DeFi","BitcoinWorld USDB Stablecoin: A Revolutionary Leap for Native Bitcoin DeFi Are you ready for a game-changer in the world of Bitcoin? For years, the Bitcoin network has been the undisputed king of digital assets, revered for its security and decentralization. Yet, its ecosystem has often been seen as separate from the burgeoning world of decentralized finance (DeFi), especially when it comes to stablecoin utility. That’s all about to change with the groundbreaking introduction of the USDB stablecoin , poised to redefine what’s possible on the original blockchain. Imagine being able to trade directly on the Bitcoin network with a stable, dollar-pegged asset, without the complexities or risks of bridging. This summer, Flashnet and Brale are set to make this a reality, launching USDB natively on Bitcoin’s Spark layer-2. This isn’t just another stablecoin; it’s a strategic move designed to unlock unprecedented liquidity and functionality for Bitcoin users, pushing the boundaries of the Bitcoin DeFi landscape. What is the USDB Stablecoin and Why It Matters? The USDB stablecoin is a fully dollar-backed digital asset, designed to bring the stability of the U.S. dollar directly to the Bitcoin network. Unlike many stablecoins that reside on other blockchains, USDB’s native integration on Bitcoin’s Spark layer-2 is a significant development. This means users will be able to hold and transact with a stable asset directly on Bitcoin, bypassing the need for cross-chain bridges that often introduce additional security risks and complexities. Here’s a quick breakdown of what makes USDB stand out: Full Backing: USDB is fully backed by U.S. Treasury bills, offering a high degree of confidence in its peg to the dollar. This strong backing ensures transparency and reduces the volatility typically associated with cryptocurrencies. Native Integration: Launching on Bitcoin’s Spark layer-2, USDB enables direct interaction within the Bitcoin ecosystem. This is crucial for fostering a truly decentralized finance environment on Bitcoin. Developed by Experts: Flashnet and Brale, the teams behind USDB, bring expertise in blockchain technology and financial infrastructure, aiming for a robust and secure launch. The importance of a reliable, dollar-backed stablecoin cannot be overstated. In a volatile crypto market, stablecoins act as safe havens, enabling traders to lock in gains, enter positions without immediate exposure to price swings, and facilitate payments with predictable value. USDB aims to provide this critical utility directly within the Bitcoin network. Unlocking Native Bitcoin Trading: The Spark Layer-2 Advantage One of the most exciting promises of USDB is its ability to facilitate native Bitcoin trading . Historically, if you wanted to trade Bitcoin with a stablecoin, you’d often have to move your BTC to an exchange or use a wrapped version on another blockchain. This process, known as bridging, introduces several pain points: Security Risks: Bridges can be vulnerable to hacks, leading to significant asset losses. Increased Fees: Transferring assets across different chains often incurs additional transaction fees. Complexity: The process can be daunting for new users, requiring multiple steps and understanding of different network mechanics. The Spark layer-2 solution, on which USDB will launch, addresses these challenges head-on. By building on a Bitcoin layer-2 , USDB leverages Bitcoin’s inherent security while providing the speed and scalability needed for efficient stablecoin transactions. This means users can engage in stable-to-Bitcoin trading directly, securely, and with lower friction, paving the way for more sophisticated financial activities on the network. How USDB Elevates the Bitcoin DeFi Ecosystem The emergence of USDB is a pivotal moment for the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem. While other blockchains like Ethereum have flourished with a rich array of DeFi applications, Bitcoin’s DeFi scene has been relatively nascent. This is largely due to the lack of native stablecoin liquidity and robust infrastructure for complex financial primitives. With USDB, several doors open for Bitcoin DeFi: Enhanced Liquidity: A reliable stablecoin encourages more capital to flow into Bitcoin-native DeFi protocols. New Financial Products: The presence of a stable asset enables the creation of lending platforms, borrowing protocols, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and yield-generating opportunities directly on Bitcoin. Reduced Volatility Risk: DeFi applications built with USDB can offer more predictable returns and lower volatility exposure for users, attracting a broader audience. A prime example of this immediate impact is the announced integration with Magic Eden. As a leading NFT marketplace, Magic Eden’s decision to integrate USDB for trading and liquidity signals a strong belief in its potential to revolutionize Bitcoin-based digital asset markets. This integration will allow users to price and trade NFTs on Bitcoin using a stable asset, a significant step forward for the ecosystem. The Power of a Dollar-Backed Stablecoin: Stability and Trust In the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, the stability offered by a dollar-backed stablecoin is invaluable. USDB’s commitment to being fully backed by U.S. Treasury bills provides a bedrock of trust and transparency. This is critical for both retail users and institutional investors who require predictability in their digital asset holdings. Consider the benefits of such robust backing: Reliable Peg: The direct backing by highly liquid and secure government assets minimizes the risk of the stablecoin losing its peg to the dollar, a common concern with less transparent or algorithmically backed stablecoins. Regulatory Confidence: A clear, auditable backing mechanism can contribute to greater regulatory acceptance and clarity, fostering broader adoption. Investor Security: Users can have greater peace of mind knowing their funds are supported by tangible, low-risk assets, rather than complex algorithms or opaque reserves. This level of stability is not just a feature; it’s a fundamental requirement for any asset that aims to serve as a reliable medium of exchange or unit of account within a financial system. USDB’s design ensures it can fulfill this role effectively on the Bitcoin network. Looking Ahead: The Future of Bitcoin Layer-2 and Beyond The launch of USDB is more than just a new stablecoin; it’s a testament to the ongoing evolution of the Bitcoin layer-2 ecosystem. Layer-2 solutions are crucial for Bitcoin’s long-term scalability, enabling faster, cheaper transactions while maintaining the security of the main chain. Spark layer-2 is one of several innovative solutions emerging, each contributing to Bitcoin’s expanding utility beyond just a store of value. What does this mean for the future? Increased Utility: Bitcoin is transforming from merely ‘digital gold’ into a versatile platform capable of supporting a wide array of financial applications. Mainstream Adoption: As stablecoins and DeFi services become more accessible and secure on Bitcoin, it paves the way for greater mainstream and institutional adoption. Innovation Spree: USDB’s success could inspire further development of new protocols and applications specifically tailored for Bitcoin’s layer-2 infrastructure. Of course, challenges remain. The adoption of new layer-2 technologies takes time, and the competitive landscape for stablecoins is fierce. Regulatory clarity for stablecoins across different jurisdictions is also an ongoing discussion. However, the fundamental value proposition of a natively integrated, dollar-backed stablecoin on Bitcoin is undeniable. A New Era for Bitcoin The impending launch of the USDB stablecoin on Bitcoin’s Spark layer-2 marks a truly transformative moment for the cryptocurrency world. By enabling seamless native Bitcoin trading with a fully dollar-backed stablecoin , USDB is set to unlock immense potential for the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem. This strategic move leverages the inherent security of Bitcoin while providing the stability and functionality required for sophisticated financial applications. As Bitcoin layer-2 solutions continue to mature, we can expect Bitcoin to solidify its position not just as a store of value, but as a robust and dynamic platform for decentralized finance. This summer, keep an eye on USDB – it might just be the spark that ignites Bitcoin’s next major chapter.

2025-06-25T00:30:12,"Can MAGACOIN FINANCE Really Turn $500 into $10K? Bitcoin, XRP, and Litecoin Traders Say Yes","As the 2025 market cycle intensifies, seasoned crypto investors are shifting their gaze from mega-caps to early-stage tokens with breakout potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE is now dominating this conversation—widely seen as one of the few altcoins that could realistically turn a $500 stake into $10,000 , marking a great ROI return in the 2025 bull run . MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Asymmetric Opportunity of the Year MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing attention for its rare mix of transparency, structure, and hype. With a fixed 170 billion token supply, fully audited contracts, and a VC-free, community-first model, the project is being embraced by analysts as one of the most promising altcoins of the year . Its ongoing early-stage traction is fueling bold forecasts an ROI seasoned upside by 2025. Bitcoin: The Benchmark, But Seeking New Multiples Bitcoin (BTC) is trading around $105,000 , continuing to serve as the market’s macro anchor. But its slower growth curve has BTC holders actively seeking fresh altcoin entries like MAGACOIN FINANCE , where the return potential is exponentially higher. XRP: Looking for the Next Big Wave XRP is hovering near $2.16 , with analysts citing summer consolidation and regulatory momentum ahead. As traders look to deploy capital into earlier-stage assets, MAGACOIN FINANCE is standing out for its blend of meme traction and strong fundamentals. Litecoin: Reliable, But Now Lagging Behind Litecoin (LTC) has pushed above $85 and is eyeing a $115–$200 range in 2025. While steady, it lacks the explosive profile that newer plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE bring—prompting many LTC holders to rebalance toward higher-upside positions. Conclusion With aggressive upside potential, unique positioning, and increasing traction among Bitcoin, XRP, and Litecoin traders, MAGACOIN FINANCE is stepping forward as a calculated early-stage bet. If forecasts hold, turning $500 into $10,000 might not just be possible—it might be one of 2025’s defining crypto wins.

2025-06-25T00:20:39,"Federal Reserve’s Unwavering Stance: Powell Rules Out Crypto Purchases","BitcoinWorld Federal Reserve’s Unwavering Stance: Powell Rules Out Crypto Purchases In a significant declaration that reverberated across financial markets, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has definitively stated that the Federal Reserve neither possesses the legal authority nor intends to seek it, to purchase cryptocurrency . This unambiguous stance, reported by Walter Bloomberg on X, provides crucial clarity regarding the U.S. central bank’s position on digital assets and its role in the evolving financial landscape. Understanding the Federal Reserve’s Position on Cryptocurrency The news that the Federal Reserve will not be acquiring cryptocurrencies might not come as a shock to seasoned market observers, but its explicit nature from the very top of the U.S. central banking system underscores a deeply entrenched cautious approach. For years, the Fed has been carefully monitoring the rise of digital assets, acknowledging their innovation while also highlighting potential risks to financial stability and consumer protection. Powell’s statement effectively draws a clear line in the sand: the Fed’s mandate is centered on maintaining price stability, maximizing employment, and ensuring the stability of the financial system. Purchasing volatile and largely unregulated assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum falls well outside its traditional purview and current legal framework. The Federal Reserve Act, which governs the Fed’s operations, outlines specific types of assets the central bank is authorized to buy, primarily U.S. Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities, as tools for conducting Monetary Policy . Key Takeaways from Powell’s Statement: Legal Constraints: The Fed currently lacks the statutory authority to purchase cryptocurrencies. No Intent to Seek Authority: This is not merely a current limitation but a declared policy choice, indicating no immediate plans to lobby for such powers. Focus on Mandate: Reinforces the Fed’s commitment to its core responsibilities of economic stability, rather than engaging in speculative asset acquisition. Why Jerome Powell’s Statement Matters for Digital Assets The words of Jerome Powell carry immense weight, influencing market sentiment and regulatory direction globally. His unequivocal declaration has several implications for the broader digital asset ecosystem: For Institutional Adoption: While private institutions, investment firms, and even some corporations have embraced cryptocurrency, the Fed’s stance signals that top-tier governmental backing for direct crypto holdings is not on the horizon. This could temper expectations for a ‘flood’ of central bank capital directly into crypto markets, emphasizing that any significant institutional adoption will continue to be driven by private sector initiatives rather than central bank balance sheets. Regulatory Landscape: The statement indirectly highlights the ongoing need for a comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. Without clear rules, central banks are unlikely to engage. Powell’s remarks reinforce the idea that robust regulation is a prerequisite for broader acceptance and integration of digital assets into the traditional financial system, not just for central banks but for banks and financial institutions they oversee. Market Perception: For some, the news might be seen as a dampener, removing the possibility of a massive, liquidity-injecting buyer in the form of the Fed. However, for others, it reinforces the decentralized and independent nature of cryptocurrencies, free from direct governmental control or manipulation through central bank purchases. It underscores that the value proposition of crypto, for now, remains outside the traditional tools of Monetary Policy . The Legal and Operational Hurdles: Why the Fed Can’t Buy Crypto Beyond the simple statement, there are profound reasons why the Fed , or any central bank, would be hesitant to purchase crypto assets, even if legally empowered. These hurdles are both legal and operational, touching upon the very essence of central banking: 1. Legal Framework and Mandate: As mentioned, the Federal Reserve Act dictates what the Fed can and cannot do. Its asset purchases are designed to influence interest rates and the money supply, not to speculate on asset prices or directly support specific industries. Introducing highly volatile, non-sovereign assets onto its balance sheet would fundamentally alter its risk profile and could be seen as an overreach of its mandate. 2. Volatility and Risk Management: Cryptocurrencies are known for their extreme price volatility. Holding such assets on a central bank’s balance sheet would expose it to significant market risk, potentially undermining its financial stability and credibility. A central bank is meant to be a beacon of stability, not a participant in high-risk trading. 3. Custody and Security: Storing vast amounts of digital assets securely presents a unique challenge. Unlike traditional securities held in established depositories, the custody of cryptocurrencies involves complex cryptographic security measures, which, if compromised, could lead to catastrophic losses. The operational infrastructure required would be immense and unprecedented for a central bank. 4. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory status of many cryptocurrencies remains ambiguous across jurisdictions. Engaging with these assets before clear global standards are established would put the Fed in a precarious position, potentially legitimizing assets that could later be deemed illegal or problematic. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) vs. Cryptocurrencies: A Clear Distinction It’s crucial to differentiate between the Fed’s stance on purchasing private cryptocurrencies and its exploration of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). While both involve ‘digital money,’ their nature and implications are vastly different: Private Cryptocurrencies: These are decentralized or privately issued digital assets (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum) that operate independently of central banks and traditional financial systems. Their value is derived from market demand and supply, and they are often subject to significant price swings. Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC): A CBDC, like a potential ‘digital dollar,’ would be a digital form of a country’s fiat currency, issued and backed by the central bank. It would be a direct liability of the central bank, just like physical cash. Its purpose would be to enhance payments, financial inclusion, and potentially provide a more resilient financial system, not to serve as an investment asset for the central bank itself. The Federal Reserve has been actively researching and discussing the potential benefits and risks of a U.S. CBDC, often referred to as a ‘digital dollar.’ This exploration is about modernizing the monetary system, not about the Fed holding speculative digital assets on its balance sheet. Jerome Powell has consistently emphasized that any U.S. CBDC would require broad public and political support, and likely congressional authorization, before moving forward. Impact on Monetary Policy and the Future of Finance The Fed’s decision not to engage in direct cryptocurrency purchases has significant implications for how Monetary Policy is conducted and the future evolution of the financial system. Central banks rely on a predictable and controllable set of tools to manage inflation, stimulate growth, and maintain stability. Introducing highly volatile and unpredictable assets like cryptocurrencies into this delicate framework would severely complicate these efforts. If the Fed were to hold cryptocurrencies, changes in their value could inadvertently affect the central bank’s balance sheet and, by extension, its ability to implement effective monetary policy. This could introduce new channels of financial instability and undermine public trust in the currency. Actionable Insights: For Investors: This news reinforces that crypto markets will continue to mature largely independently of direct central bank intervention. Investors should focus on fundamental analysis, technological innovation, and regulatory developments, rather than anticipating central bank support. For Policymakers: The focus remains on establishing clear regulatory guidelines for digital assets, protecting consumers, and preventing illicit activities, rather than exploring direct central bank participation in crypto markets. The future of finance will undoubtedly involve digital assets, but the path for central banks, particularly the Federal Reserve , appears to be one of cautious oversight and potentially the issuance of their own digital currencies, rather than direct participation in the private cryptocurrency market. Conclusion: A Clear Path Forward Jerome Powell’s statement is a definitive declaration that clarifies the Federal Reserve’s position on cryptocurrency . It underscores the central bank’s commitment to its traditional mandate of financial stability and effective Monetary Policy , while avoiding the inherent risks and legal complexities associated with holding private digital assets. This clarity helps shape expectations for both the crypto industry and the broader financial world, reinforcing that the Fed’s role in the digital age will be one of careful observation, regulation, and potentially the development of a secure Central Bank Digital Currency , rather than direct market participation.
