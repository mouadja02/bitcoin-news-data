2025-06-25T07:52:47,"Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund Backs $200M Raise for Polymarket at $1B Valuation","Polymarket, a crypto-based prediction market platform , is on the verge of closing a $200 million raise that would value the company at $1 billion, according to a recent report from Reuters . Key Takeaways: Polymarket is nearing a $200M raise at a $1B valuation led by Founders Fund. Despite bans and an FBI raid, the platform continues to grow and attract major backing. With over 21,000 open markets, Polymarket has become a global hub for political and economic betting. The raise is being led by Founders Fund, the venture capital firm co-founded by billionaire investor Peter Thiel. The deal would give Polymarket “unicorn” status, a notable milestone for a company that remains inaccessible to U.S. users. Banned and Raided, Polymarket Still Draws Big Money Despite being banned domestically and targeted by federal authorities, including a November FBI search that resulted in the seizure of electronics from founder Shayne Coplan, Polymarket has continued to attract both capital and attention. The new investment follows over $100 million in prior funding, including an undisclosed $50 million round earlier in 2025. It also comes shortly after Polymarket announced a partnership with Elon Musk’s X , aimed at integrating its betting markets with commentary from Grok, X’s AI chatbot. This might be the most unexpected partnership of the year: X just teamed up with Polymarket. The platform that predicted Trump’s win while every poll showed 50–50. But this isn’t just a partnership… It's the death of traditional media. Here’s why it changes EVERYTHING: pic.twitter.com/gh2y2Ho601 — Ricardo (@Ric_RTP) June 7, 2025 Polymarket has made headlines for its rapid growth, especially during the 2024 U.S. presidential election. At its peak in November, trading volume reached $2.5 billion, fueled by speculation on political and geopolitical events. The platform allows users to bet on topics ranging from global conflicts and economic trends to legislation and local politics. Recent markets include predictions on a potential U.S. recession, the odds of Israel striking Iran again, and the likelihood of the stablecoin-focused GENIUS Act becoming law , currently sitting at 87% according to the site. According to its analytics dashboard , Polymarket hosts more than 21,000 open markets, with 1.2 million traders, 20 million open positions, and $700 million in active trading volume. Data from Dune Analytics shows May’s monthly trading volume at $1.1 billion, down from the November peak but still substantial. While its growth has been remarkable, Polymarket also faces regulatory pressure beyond the U.S., with bans or restrictions in France, Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan, Poland, and Belgium. It has also drawn scrutiny over alleged manipulation of outcomes. The firm competes with other prediction platforms such as Kalshi, which is backed by Sequoia Capital and Y Combinator. CFTC Probes Super Bowl Contracts by Crypto.com and Kalshi In March, the CFTC announced that it is reviewing Super Bowl-related prediction contracts offered by Crypto.com and Kalshi Inc. to determine if they comply with federal derivatives laws. Crypto.com introduced its sports event trading product last year, enabling users to make predictions on high-profile events like the Super Bowl. Despite that, the CFTC has expressed concern over whether such contracts qualify as legal derivatives. In January, the agency’s five commissioners voted to initiate a 90-day review of the Super Bowl futures products, effectively extending the probe past the game’s February 9 kickoff.

2025-06-25T07:47:12,"Trump Media files 19b-4 to list Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF on NYSE Arca","Truth Social operator, Trump Media and Technology Group Corp, has filed a Form 19b-4 to list the Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF on NYSE Arca. According to a June 24 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the ETF, proposed under the ticker symbol B.T., would hold 75% of its assets in Bitcoin and 25% in Ethereum. The product is structured as a commodity-based trust, with Yorkville America Digital named as sponsor and Crypto.com’s affiliated trust entity, Foris DAX Trust Company, acting as custodian for both crypto assets. The ETF aims to provide a simplified, single-ticker exposure to the two largest digital assets by market capitalization. If approved, it would trade on NYSE Arca and offer retail and institutional investors access to spot Bitcoin and Ethereum markets through traditional brokerage platforms. The latest Form 19b-4 submission follows Trump Media’s June 16 announcement that it had filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC. While the S-1 covers disclosure and structural details required for a public offering, the 19b-4 is a separate procedural step seeking regulatory approval for the product to be listed and traded on a national securities exchange. Both forms are necessary before the ETF can launch. The Form 19b-4 reiterates key elements first outlined in the S-1, including the fund’s passive investment strategy and the use of CME CF benchmark reference rates to calculate net asset value. You might also like: Trump Media files Form S-3 with U.S. SEC over $2.3B raise for Bitcoin treasury According to the filing, the fund’s Bitcoin and Ethereum holdings will be custodied in cold storage by Foris DAX Trust Company, a Crypto.com affiliate. In addition to custody, Crypto.com will also serve as the execution agent and provide staking and liquidity services to support the fund’s operations. With the 19b-4 now submitted, the SEC will begin its formal review process. The Commission has up to 240 days to make a final decision, though an initial response is typically issued within 45 days. With crypto ETFs seeing heavy demand in the U.S., Trump Media has now put forward its second offering. The earlier proposal , filed June 3 via NYSE Arca, seeks to list the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF, a spot product focused solely on Bitcoin, using the same sponsor and custodian as the dual-asset fund. As of now, it remains under SEC review, with the agency’s final decision expected by Jan. 29, 2026, if all extensions are used.

Metaplanet announced the exercise of its 20th series of stock acquisition rights under the recently announced 555 Million Plan, raising 74.9 billion yen, ($515 million) in a single day. It issued 54 million new shares on Wednesday following the exercise of 540,000 stock acquisition rights, representing 29% of the total rights issued. The issue is the first major capital injection under the plan and represents 10% of the full target. Metaplanet stock slumped as much as 15% before rallying strongly to close up 4%. CEO Simon Gerovich emphasized the strategic milestone with a post on X, highlighting the strong start to the program.

In a recent video, analyst Edward Farina made a comparison, claiming that buying XRP at this level is like buying Bitcoin when it was under $100. Farina warns that many traders are trying to time the market by selling now and hoping to buy back at lower prices, a strategy he thinks will backfire for 95% of them. “The breakout doesn’t wait for your plan,” he warned. Buying $XRP at $2 is the equivalent of buying BTC below $100. And most people are trying to sell now to ""buy back lower."" That’s exactly how 95% will be priced out. The breakout doesn’t wait for your plan. pic.twitter.com/I0FQFdbDhb — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) June 25, 2025 Drawing from his own experience in 2019-2020, Farina admitted he repeatedly lost out while attempting to outsmart the market. He sees the same pattern unfolding today, with many XRP holders recently selling below $2, convinced a deeper crash was coming. Some even placed buy orders anticipating a 30–70% drop, only to watch the market sharply reverse and turn green, leaving them on the sidelines. With influential figures like Arthur Britto resurfacing and several bullish catalysts emerging around XRP, it could be on the verge of a major breakout. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Prediction For June 25 , The Cold Wallet Strategy Farina advised keeping 90% of XRP in a cold wallet to avoid emotional selling and said to use only 10% for trading. His number one rule is to “ Never sell your core XRP bag .” According to him, XRP is the only asset that could “ skyrocket overnight .” A single catalyst, like an official Swift partnership or a major central bank announcement, could send the price soaring. In such a scenario, those who sold XRP to save 20 or 30 cents might find themselves permanently priced out of the market. XRP Under $2 Is a “Gift” Analyst DustyBC says that XRP under $2 is a rare opportunity, predicting the market will look back by December 2025 and recognize its value. Crypto Bitlord agrees, calling XRP under $2 a gift, and has set a $7 target.

2025-06-25T07:26:38,"Trump Media Files for Bitcoin-Ethereum ETF Amid Crypto Expansion","Trump Media & Technology Group, led by President Donald Trump, has submitted a registration to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a new exchange-traded fund (ETF) that will directly hold Bitcoin and Ethereum. The proposed Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF plans to allocate 75% to Bitcoin and 25% to Ethereum , offering investors exposure to both cryptocurrencies through a single product. Crypto.com has been appointed as the ETF's exclusive custodian, prime execution agent, and provider of staking and liquidity services . The ETF's launch is contingent upon the SEC's approval of both the registration statement and a rule change application. If approved, the ETF will be listed on the NYSE Arca exchange. This initiative is part of Trump Media's broader strategy to integrate cryptocurrency into its business model. In May, the company announced plans to raise $2.5 billion to establish a Bitcoin treasury, reflecting its commitment to digital assets. However, the move has sparked controversy due to potential conflicts of interest, as President Trump actively promotes cryptocurrency while his company engages in related financial ventures. Critics argue that this intertwining of political influence and personal business interests could undermine regulatory integrity. The SEC's decision on the ETF is pending, and its outcome could significantly impact the intersection of politics and cryptocurrency investment in the United States.",coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/trump-media-files-for-bitcoin-ethereum-etf-amid-crypto-expansion,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|REGULATION","",cryptocompare
2025-06-25T07:25:52,"Bitcoin Price Trades Sidewise In June: Is The Bull Market Over?","Bitcoin’s price lost 2.29% in the 30 days ending Jun. 24. Meanwhile, a bevy of tech stocks like Palantir, Nvidia, and Oracle are flying high. Is the BTC bull market over? Or can BTC still hit the $150K – $200K price predictions for 2025, recently made by popular crypto investing commentators? Crypto exchanges are dynamic, fast-moving, open, global markets for these high tech Internet currencies. So no one knows for sure what Bitcoin’s price will do next until markets have moved. But there are some clues and historical patterns that savvy currency traders and investors use to decide what and when to buy, sell, and hold. The daily movements in June’s Bitcoin prices have confounded the bullish 12-month and 24-month trend. Here’s a quick rundown of Bitcoin vs. selected tech stocks in June. Bitcoin Severely Lags Tech Stocks in June 2025 For the 30 days ending Tuesday, Jun. 24, Bitcoin fell more than 2%. But global trade policy and military instability aren’t weighing on several important US tech stocks. Santa Clara, California-based computer chipmaker Nvidia, for example, the second highest-weighted US stock by market size, gained over 9.15% in share prices. Meanwhile, Denver, Colorado-based US data company Palantir, gained over 19.84%. Oracle, another high-tech data company, based in Nashville, Tennessee, and ranked #17 among all US companies by size, surged 32.5% for the 30-day window by market close on Tuesday. All three companies are ultra-high market cap with many useful points of comparison to Bitcoin, the world’s leading cryptocurrency. They’ve been rallying, while BTC retraces its April and May gains. So is the crypto rally fizzling out? Bitcoin Price Rainbow Chart Recommends ‘BUY!’ Many experts don’t think so. A bear market in Bitcoin any time soon also does not align with the historical trend. Source: Bitbo.io According to the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart, a popular trading recommendation tool based on Bitcoin’s historical price trend, the price appears far from its multi-year cycle peak. In fact, it is comparable on the rainbow chart to previous markets like Nov. 2020 and May 2017. The May 2017 market valued BTC at $1,434 per token on May 1. By Dec. 17, 2017, the price had skyrocketed to just above $20,000, for a 1,400% ROI in under 9 months. The Nov. 2020 market appraised Bitcoin at $13,862 on Nov. 1. By Apr. 15, 2021, the price rallied to $62,208, for a 450% ROI in under 6 months. Legendary veteran stock market chart trader Peter Brandt expects Bitcoin to move as high as $150,00 by August or September. In an interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box in May, Galaxy Digital founder Mike Novogratz said he expects the price to top out above $150,000 before this cycle is over.

2025-06-25T07:21:53,"Crypto Tax Rules in India Trigger Mass Notices to Traders","The post Crypto Tax Rules in India Trigger Mass Notices to Traders appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News India’s stance on cryptocurrency continues to spark debate. On one hand, the government imposes a steep 30% tax on crypto gains, prohibits offsetting losses, and enforces a 1% TDS on every crypto transaction. On the other hand, it hasn’t outright banned digital assets, leaving the sector stuck between regulation and uncertainty. Mixed Signals From India’s Crypto Policy India’s crypto industry is divided. While Raj Kapoor , CEO of the India Blockchain Alliance, believes strict rules are better than ambiguity, many crypto players argue for reform. Local exchanges are pushing for: Reducing TDS from 1% to 0.01% Allowing losses to be offset against gains However, with rising concerns about tax evasion and cybercrime, authorities are hesitant to embrace liberal crypto policies just yet. Indian Tax Authorities Are Watching Crypto Traders Closely The Indian Income Tax Department has issued notices to thousands of individuals who traded digital assets but failed to report them in the FY 2022–23 and 2023–24 tax filings. Authorities suspect that some traders used crypto as a tool for tax evasion, exploiting the lack of detailed reporting standards during the early days of regulation. Crypto traders must now correct their filings using the updated return option. CoinDCX Co-founder Sumit Gupta has advised all users to report crypto income, including earnings from airdrops or global exchanges, and emphasized the need to stay compliant. India’s Crypto Tax Rules: A Barrier to Growth? India’s current crypto tax policy includes: 30% capital gains tax on digital assets No loss offset allowed 1% TDS on transactions exceeding Rs. 10,000 Due to these tough regulations, top global exchanges like OKX have exited the Indian market. Even homegrown platforms feel the pressure, urging policymakers to reconsider the TDS rate and revise the tax structure to promote growth and investment. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Income Tax Department Takes Strict Action Against Undisclosed Crypto Income , Crypto Crime Rising in India: A Key Concern India’s reluctance to ease crypto regulations stems in part from the rise in crypto-linked cybercrimes. Recently, the CBI arrested Rahul Arora , seizing over $327,000 in crypto tied to scams in the U.S. and Canada . In February , the GainBitcoin scam led to raids on 60 locations and the seizure of $2.9 million in digital assets — a case involving over $800 million in fraud. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has now built in-house systems to track and seize crypto, signaling the government’s focus on creating a safer crypto environment before relaxing policies. Final Take: India Isn’t Crypto-Unfriendly, But It’s Cautious India isn’t against crypto, but it’s not fully embracing it either. With tax notices being sent, foreign platforms exiting, and cybercrimes increasing, the focus remains on compliance and safety rather than rapid liberalization. Until India establishes a robust regulatory framework, a truly crypto-friendly economy might remain out of reach. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The filing, made under the SEC’s 19b-4 process, marks a key procedural step toward public trading but doesn’t guarantee approval. It comes less than a month after Trump Media said it would raise $2.4 billion to build its own BTC treasury, though there have been no announced purchases so far. Beyond the Truth Social ETF filings, Trump Media and Yorkville are planning a full suite of politically branded crypto products, including the America First Bitcoin Fund, the America First Blockchain Leaders Fund, and the America First Stablecoin Income Fund. Only the Truth-branded ETFs have been formally filed with the SEC so far.

2025-06-25T07:04:00,"Crypto Analyst Calls for New Bitcoin All-Time High After Brief Dip Below $100,000, Predicts Rallies for Ethereum and WIF","An analyst who has earned the “Master Trader” rank on the crypto exchange Bybit believes that Bitcoin ( BTC ) is now poised for a surge to new record-high levels. Pseudonymous trader Bluntz tells his 321,100 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin completed an ABC correction after its brief dip below $100,000 over the weekend. Bluntz practices the Elliott Wave theory, which states that a bullish asset tends to witness new rallies after concluding an ABC pullback. Says the trader, “BTC looking like a nice ABC here, bounced lower channel and reclaimed breakdown range. Send it to all-time high.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $106,111. Turning to Ethereum, the trader thinks that the altcoin has printed a low against Bitcoin ( ETH /BTC) after also completing an ABC correction. “ETH/BTC has probably bottomed here, in my opinion.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, ETH/BTC is trading for 0.02308 BTC ($2,451). As for the Solana ( SOL )-based memecoin dogwifhat, Bluntz believes that WIF has completed an ABC correction as well and is now primed to ignite a five-wave surge. According to Elliott Wave principles, a five-wave rally is made up of three upside moves – waves one, three and five – and two corrective periods in waves two and four. “Still a lot of work to put in and need to see price action confirm, but I think there’s a very real chance a new impulse back to all-time high on WIF has commenced.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, WIF is worth $0.875.

2025-06-25T06:52:37,"Crypto Trader Sees Bitcoin Hitting $160K by Year-End; ETH, SOL, ADA to Gain on Middle East Truce","Bitcoin BTC is back above $106,000 after dipping below five figures earlier this week, as global markets steadied on signs that a ceasefire between Israel and Iran is holding. Meanwhile, Ether ETH traded at $2,400, up 0.5% on the day, approaching resistance near $2,450. Dogecoin DOGE hovered at 16 cents after a minor 0.6% rise, while Solana’s SOL SOL dipped to $145, down 0.2%. Cardano’s ADA ADA slid nearly 1.3% to 58 cents after briefly testing the 60 cents level earlier in the week. Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, said BTC’s inability to stabilize immediately after its initial drop below $99,000 signaled lingering caution, even as ETF inflows — now totaling $46 billion — continue to provide structural support. “Its potential as a safe-haven shines through, but tempered risk appetite delays recovery,” Lee said. Despite this, Lee sees bitcoin hitting $110,000–$115,000 by Q3 and potentially $130,000–$160,000 by year-end. Lee expects ether to be in the $2,600–$2,800 in the near term and as high as $5,500 longer term. The rebound comes amid a broader shift in risk sentiment. U.S. equity futures edged higher on Wednesday, building on the Nasdaq 100’s record close the previous session, while Asian stocks extended their two-day rally. Treasuries firmed and the dollar steadied after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said “many paths are possible” for monetary policy, reinforcing bets on interest rate cuts as consumer confidence weakens. Bitcoin's recovery after its weekend fall has reignited debate over whether it’s maturing into a true safe-haven asset or simply responding to macro tailwinds and ETF-driven flows. “Bitcoin’s status as a safe-haven asset is still taking shape,” said Gadi Chait, head of investment at Xapo Bank. “Its V‑shaped recovery back above $105K in under 48 hours after falling into the nineties highlights its growing liquidity and integration into mainstream portfolios.” Chait added that while geopolitical shocks often spark a flight to cash, recent cycles show that institutional bids now help shallow the dips and accelerate rebounds.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/25/crypto-trader-sees-bitcoin-hitting-160k-by-year-end-eth-sol-ada-to-gain-on-middle-east-truce,"ADA|BTC|ETH|MARKET|SOL","Markets|Markets|Trading|Bitcoin|Ether|Solana|Cardano|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-25T06:51:16,"Mutuum Finance holds strong as crypto slides on Iran-Israel tensions","Over the weekend, as tensions escalated in the Middle East after the US struck Iranian facilities, the crypto market experienced a massive plunge. The price of BTC fell below the critical $100,000 level. These strikes also affected the rest of the market, which slid in response to the plunge of BTC. However, Bitcoin (BTC) has since rebounded to above $103,000 as Trump clarified the strikes were limited in their extent. The rest of the financial markets have also stabilized. However, tensions remain high with fears of another dip if military action rises in the region. Amid this rising volatility in the crypto market, one crypto continues to experience growing attention from the crypto market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has seen a steady stream of capital into the presale as investors seek out new opportunities for growth. That has helped push the presale to astronomical heights, with analysts forecasting that MUTM tokens could rise 24x once they go live. Let us take a closer look at the presale. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in phase 5 of its presale, where tokens are going for $0.03 each. So far, over $11.1 million has been raised in the presale, from around 12,400 buyers. The phase presale price represents a 20% increase from the phase 4 price of $0.025. This trend of gradual increases is expected to continue until the final listing price. In the upcoming phase 6, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. As such, the current price of MUTM tokens is a massive 50% discount on the planned listing price. That represents a massive opportunity that investors are working fast to take advantage of. Based on the analysts’ forecast of 24x gains for MUTM tokens when they go live, a $1,300 investment in the presale today could grow to $31,200. Best of all, there is no limit on how much you can invest in the presale. That means you could potentially make a life-changing investment with this one presale. This is one opportunity that you should not let pass you by while you still have an opportunity to do something about it. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) protocol Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a well-designed protocol that will ensure long-term sustainable gains for its users. The team has taken major steps to inspire confidence in its community, including getting a CertiK, which proves that the team cares about the security of its users. According to the results of the audit, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has received a Token Scan Score of 95. This signals that the protocol is of high quality and a secure investment option for those looking for growth in the current crypto market. The protocol allows users to participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. As lenders, they can deposit their assets into the protocol for a chance to earn interest via an APY. The APY in the pools is varied and is determined by the pool utilization rate. As the utilization rate rises, it pushes up the interest rate, which encourages borrowers to repay their loans. At the same time, the rising interest rate encourages new lenders to join the protocol to benefit from the higher yields. This cycle ensures that liquidity in the protocol will rise continuously, while at the same time ensuring optimal capital efficiency. As a result, it will ensure the stability of the protocol in the long term. In real-world terms, if a user deposits $10,000 worth of USDC in a pool, and the utilization rate pushes up the APY to 18%, that means the deposit will receive $1,800 worth of USDC in a year. With the expected massive growth in the user base, this could ensure a long-term stable passive income for participants. Since rates are automatically adjusted in real time based on market demand, it will ensure that depositors always get the best rate possible. To help with tracking earnings on the protocol, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will use an innovation called mtTokens. For instance, when a user deposits their USDC in a pool, they will receive mtUSDC tokens in return. These tokens will represent the value of their deposit plus any interest accrued. The value of the mtTokens will be updated in real time to reflect the interest growth over time. A major advantage of this system is that users will not need to actively claim or compound their gains. As a result, it ensures full transparency for users. To support the growth of the protocol, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team plans to use protocol profits for marketing purposes and growing liquidity in the pools. Additionally, they plan to use protocol revenue to purchase MUTM tokens off the open market, which is expected to push up the price of the tokens. As their price increases, it will boost the visibility of the protocol, helping to bring in more profits. That will create a self-sustaining cycle of upward growth. With a 50% discount available in the current phase 5 of the presale, adding MUTM tokens to your portfolio could be your best crypto investment decision of 2025.

2025-06-25T06:30:00,"Bitfinex Securities Is Taking a Different Approach to RWAs, Launches Two New Products in the U.K.","These days, the mention of blockchain-based real world assets (RWAs) conjures up traditional finance institutions, like BlackRock, presiding over billions of dollars in tokenized money market funds. But the original promise of crypto was about opening up finance opportunities to anyone. That’s the ethos Bitfinex Securities is sticking to with its latest tokenized equity issuances: two alternative finance products in the UK, one focused on community banking debt, the other on litigation relating to mis-sold car finance claims. Announced on Wednesday, Bitfinex Securities’ “ TITAN1 ” product will allocate 5 million british pounds ($6.8 million) into subordinate debt issued by Castle Community Bank, a firm supporting loans to financially excluded customers in Edinburgh, Scotland. This alternative debt product will provide investors with a 20% dividend per annum (net of fees), which will be paid quarterly for up to 10 years, with non-callable provisions for the first 5 years, according to a press release. The second structure, “ TITAN2, ” will invest 100 million british pounds ($136 million) into litigation financing related to car finance mis-selling claims in the UK, a market expected to generate billions in compensation. Funds will be deployed through equity-linked notes and Investors will receive a 50% share of the claims recovery proceeds split proportionately among investors, Bitfinex Securities said. Both listings will be accessible to investors as tradable tokens via Bitfinex Securities’ secondary market. The tokens have been issued on the Liquid Network, a side chain of Bitcoin developed by technology firm Blockstream, where transfers require issuer authorization, with a whitelist system ensuring compliance standards and jurisdictional requirements. Looking back in time, Bitfinex Securities’ foray into tokenized RWAs pre-dates by some years the current trend for blockchain-based financial assets issued by institutions like BlackRock or Franklin Templeton. The firm started out with niche products like a tokenized bitcoin mining hashrate contract linked to Blockstream, followed by a number of bond issuances, including the first tokenized U.S. Treasuries offering in the nascent crypto hub of El Salvador, bringing T-Bill investments to individuals and organizations who were previously unable to access these products. Jesse Knutson, head of operations at Bitfinex Securities, takes a philosophical view of the current tokenization trend. “We want to be able to help people bridge that gap to investors,” Knutson said in an interview. “Whether it's a company or a bond issuance, or whatever it is, to raise capital and kind of fill that gap that's left by banks in many parts of the world that just aren't willing to lend, or where people struggle to get access to capital.” Fresh off a digital assets panel in London alongside BlackRock and UK asset manager Schroders, Knutson said there’s something of a bias in the ecosystem towards fixed income. Most of the focus is around money market funds, where people tend to buy and hold to get a yield, so there's just not a lot of trading, he said. “A big part of this is about disintermediation, and I think that’s something the institutional guys don't quite get,” Knutson said. “When you look at the details of what they've actually done, it's typically left hand to right hand. It's the same kind of people. It's going through depositories, it's going through transfer payment agents, all of the normal kind of parts of the traditional ecosystem, which I don't think are technologically probably necessary.” Read more: How the Next Wave of RWAs is Becoming Crypto’s Real Edge",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/06/25/bitfinex-securities-is-taking-a-different-approach-to-rwas-launches-two-new-products-in-the-u-k,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SPONSORED","Finance|Tokenization|Bitfinex securities|News",cryptocompare

2025-06-25T06:18:18,"Bitcoin's Upcoming $14B Options Expiry Marked by Surge in Put-Call Ratio. What Does it Indicate?","Bitcoin's BTC put-call ratio has jumped ahead of Friday's multi-billion-dollar options expiry on Deribit, but its traditional bearish interpretation may not tell the full story this time. The put-call open interest ratio refers to the ratio of active put contracts to active call contracts at a given time. An increase in the put-call ratio indicates a bias towards put options, offering protection against downside risks, and is interpreted as representing a bearish market sentiment. However, the latest spike is at least partly driven by ""cash-secured puts"" – a yield-generation and BTC accumulation strategy. The strategy involves selling (writing) put options, a move analogous to selling insurance against price drops in return for a small upfront premium. At the same time, the writer keeps enough cash (in stablecoins) on the sidelines to buy BTC as obligated if the prices decline and the buyer decides to exercise the right to sell BTC at the predetermined higher price. The premium collected by writing the put option represents a yield with the potential for BTC accumulation if the put buyer exercises the option. ""The put/call ratio has risen to 0.72 — up from just above 0.5 in 2024— indicating a growing interest in put options, often structured as cash-secured puts,"" Lin Chen, head of business development - Asia at Deribit, told CoinDesk. Options expiry worth $14 billion looming On Friday, at 08:00 UTC, a total of 141,271 BTC options contracts, worth over $14 billion, representing more than 40% of the total open interest will expire on Deribit, according to data source Deribit Metrics. Of the total due for settlement, 81,994 contracts are calls, while the rest are put options. On Deribit, one options contract represents one BTC. Chen said that nearly 20% of expiring calls are ""in-the-money (in profit),"" meaning that a large number of market participants hold calls at strikes that are below BTC's current spot market rate of $106,000. ""This suggests call buyers have performed well this cycle, aligning with the persistent inflows into BTC ETFs,"" Chen noted. Holders of in-the-money (ITM) calls are already profitable and may choose to book profits or hedge their positions as expiry nears, which can add to market volatility. Alternatively, they might roll over (shift) positions to the next expiry. ""As this is a major quarterly expiry, we expect heightened volatility around the event,"" Chen said. Broadly speaking, most of calls are set to expire out-of-the-money or worthless. Notably, the $300 call has the highest open interest, a sign traders likely hoped for an outsized price rally in the first half. The max pain for the expiry is $102,000, a level where option buyers would suffer the most. Focus on $100K-$105K range Latest market flows indicate expectations for back-and-forth trading, with a slight bullish bias as we approach the expiry. According to data tracked by leading crypto market maker Wintermute, the latest flows are skewed neutral, with traders selling straddles —a volatility bearish strategy — and writing calls around $105,000 and shorting puts at $100,000 for the June 27 expiry. ""For #BTC options, flows skew neutral with straddle/call selling around 105K and short puts at 100K (27 Jun), pointing to expectations of tight price action into expiry. Selective call buying (108K–112K, Jul/Sep) adds a capped bullish tilt. IV remains elevated,"" OTC desk at Wintermute, told CoinDesk in an email.

A June 25 announcement, shared by Pompliano on X, outlines a business merger that would form ProCap Financial, Inc., a Nasdaq-listed entity. The move comes after a series of high-profile events for the company, demonstrating its intention to develop institutional infrastructure around Bitcoin ( BTC ). https://twitter.com/apompliano/status/1937655546695549235?s=46&t=nznXkss3debX8JIhNzHmzw Just a day before the filing, ProCap disclosed the purchase of 3,724 BTC, worth approximately $387 million, at an average price of $103,785 per coin. In addition, the company recently raised more than $750 million, which included $225 million in convertible debt and $550 million in equity. The funds will support its long-term strategy of treating Bitcoin as a primary treasury asset, according to investor materials. You might also like: Corporations continue to spawn Bitcoin treasuries— What’s good about them? ProCap aims to differentiate itself from traditional financial firms by generating yield on Bitcoin holdings while offering products for institutional investors. If the merger is completed, ProCap would become one of the top 15 publicly traded corporate Bitcoin holders globally, according to data from Bitcointreasuries.com. The special-purpose acquisition company merger route comes as more crypto-native companies explore public listings amid increasing regulatory clarity in the U.S. ProCap’s planned listing joins several digital asset firms seeking market legitimacy through public offerings. As part of the process, Columbus Circle and ProCap will submit a registration statement to the SEC, including a joint prospectus and proxy materials. Investors and stakeholders are encouraged to review those filings once available. Pompliano, a long-time Bitcoin advocate, has positioned ProCap as a pure-play on BTC’s future as institutional demand grows. With significant capital raised and a clear focus on Bitcoin-native financial services, the firm is shaping up to be one of the most closely watched crypto listings of 2025.

2025-06-25T06:11:38,"Ethereum price Eyes 107% Surge as Golden Cross Pattern Returns","The post Ethereum price Eyes 107% Surge as Golden Cross Pattern Returns appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market turned green after a surprise ceasefire in the Middle East. Along with the ceasefire, a few other big changes took place in global markets, creating a bullish mood for cryptocurrencies, especially altcoins. The recent price drop could have been a bottom for altcoins, and the sharp recovery since then supports this view. Indicators also hint that altcoins could soon outperform Bitcoin. Ethereum and the altcoin market are showing signs of something big brewing. After the recent sharp drop in prices, which felt like a final shakeout for many traders, market charts are starting to look very bullish. Interestingly, just like how oil prices hinted at a ceasefire before it was officially announced, crypto charts too have a habit of predicting major moves before they happen. Ethereum and Golden Cross On Crypto Banter’s Ran Show, the analyst said that Ethereum is about to form a golden cross, a technical signal where the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average. In the past, this pattern has led to huge price jumps for ETH, including rallies of 107%, 25%, and even an incredible 2,500%. What makes it even more exciting is that the entire altcoin market, excluding Bitcoin, is also just days away from forming its own golden cross. Historically, these moments have triggered powerful rallies in the market. With interest rates falling, market sentiment shifting, and technical signals lining up, it looks like Ethereum and altcoins might be getting ready for a strong move upward in the weeks ahead. Ethereum Short-Term Price Targets: Ethereum has seen a short rally in the past 12 hours, but it’s too early to confirm a strong recovery. Important support lies around $2,380, this level must hold to keep hopes alive for a bigger breakout.

2025-06-25T06:00:41,"Top Analyst Charts XRP Price Path to $11","Crypto analyst Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) believes XRP is now approaching a critical turning point after a market-wide correction. In a recent post on X, he shared an $11 target and linked to a YouTube video outlining a strategy that anticipates one final leg down before a significant reversal. He placed strong emphasis on structure, liquidity zones, and volume behavior, suggesting that this could be the final opportunity to accumulate before a sharp rally. XRP traded just over $2 at the time of his analysis, after recovering from a dip below $2 , and he noted the absence of a decisive bottoming structure. According to the analyst, XRP is close to completing a right shoulder in a potential reversal pattern , estimating the ideal level around $1.89. A crash toward $1.85 is possible, with further downside to $1.73 or even as low as $1.55 not entirely ruled out. However, these lower targets are not his base case. Bitcoin and ETH Analysis Support Outlook The broader market context supports this cautious stance. Bitcoin, for instance, bounced from $98,200, but Cryptoinsightuk suggested further downside is likely before a true bottom forms. He expects a price range between $92,000 and $95,000 to act as a more probable reversal zone, citing past RSI behavior and a similarity to previous patterns. As for Ethereum, he sees potential for a dip to around $1,996 before it moves higher. Liquidity is thinning below current levels, which he interpreted as waning long interest, which often precedes a final shakeout before reversal riwa$4,200. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Final Flush or Start of Expansion? The central thesis hinges on what he described as a typical structure: a flush of liquidity, followed by bullish divergence and then aggressive expansion toward $11 . He acknowledged the more conservative calls for $8 but stated he sees an extension beyond that figure, estimating $11 to $12 as the upper limit for this rally phase. He confirmed that he’s been actively accumulating during the drawdown. He reaffirmed his long-term view that this pullback was expected and necessary before the next major move. The projection relies on XRP first completing a final move down by 5% to 10% before surging in what he believes will be the next phase of the cycle. Notably, another analyst recently set an $8 to $13 target for XRP, adding credence to Cryptoinsightuk’s prediction. Cryptoinsightuk highlighted spot buying during XRP’s flush and rising open interest, suggesting one more dip before recovery. He expects alt season to begin if Bitcoin dominance falls and sees XRP pushing toward $11 soon. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Key Takeaways: ProCap BTC purchased 3,724 BTC for $386 million ahead of its planned IPO via SPAC merger. The firm’s Bitcoin holdings are now worth nearly $400 million as BTC prices rise. ProCap aims to accumulate up to $1 billion in BTC, joining a wave of corporate treasury buyers. His firm, ProCap BTC, announced Tuesday that it had acquired 3,724 BTC for $386 million, just days after revealing plans to go public later this year. The purchase was made at a time-weighted average price of $103,785 per Bitcoin. Bitcoin Gains Lift Pompliano’s Investment to Nearly $400M With Bitcoin prices climbing since the buy, Pompliano’s investment now sits just below $400 million in value. The acquisition follows Monday’s announcement that ProCap intends to go public through a merger with Columbus Circle Capital, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), forming a new entity named ProCap Financial. “We believe Bitcoin is the new hurdle rate. If you can’t beat it, you have to buy it,” Pompliano wrote on X, underscoring the firm’s conviction in the asset. We have purchased 3,724 Bitcoin. This purchase happened within one day after announcing a $1 BILLION merger and over $750 million fundraise. The average price was ~ $103,785 per bitcoin. We believe bitcoin is the new hurdle rate.

Backers of the upcoming SPAC deal have already raised over $750 million, $516 million in equity commitments and $235 million via convertible notes. Should ProCap go public today, its BTC position would rank 14th among all publicly listed companies, according to BiTBO data. It would sit just behind Semler Scientific, a medical technology firm that recently entered the Bitcoin treasury space. ProCap joins a growing number of firms moving aggressively into Bitcoin. MicroStrategy extended its lead this week with holdings now totaling 592,345 BTC. Japan’s Metaplanet increased its exposure to 11,111 BTC . Grant Cardone’s real estate group disclosed its first buy, 1,000 BTC, while mineral exploration company Panther Metals laid out a $5.4 million crypto strategy combining traditional mining with digital assets. Also this week, Norway’s Green Minerals AS revealed plans to allocate $1.2 billion toward Bitcoin purchases. VanEck Warns BTC Treasury Strategy May Backfire Just recently, VanEck’s head of digital asset research, Matthew Sigel, raised concerns about the Bitcoin treasury strategies used by certain public companies, suggesting that continued accumulation of BTC could soon harm shareholders more than help. He specifically criticized the use of at-the-market (ATM) share issuance programs, warning that they can become dilutive when stock prices approach the company’s Bitcoin net asset value (NAV). Sigel proposed several measures to prevent value erosion, including pausing ATM programs if a company’s stock trades below 0.95x NAV for over 10 days. He drew comparisons to past failures in the crypto mining sector, where excessive dilution and executive pay led to major shareholder losses. As an example, he cited Semler Scientific, a medical tech firm that entered the BTC space in 2024. Despite acquiring 3,808 BTC, its stock has fallen over 45%, and its mNAV has dropped to 0.82x.

The HB 2324 reserve bill gives the state of Arizona the authority to set up a “Bitcoin and Digital Assets Reserve Fund” using cryptocurrencies obtained through criminal forfeiture. Once signed into law, this bill would become the second state-level measure in Arizona to establish a crypto-based state reserve. 🇺🇸 JUST IN: Arizona passes 'Bitcoin Reserve' bill HB2324. The bill creates a reserve for assets obtained through criminal asset forfeiture. If signed by Governor Hobbs, it will be the state's second second reserve bill passed into law. pic.twitter.com/0OlT01LtZp — Bitcoin Laws (@Bitcoin_Laws) June 25, 2025 HB 2324 was initially voted down in the House during its third reading on May 7. However, the state Senate agreed on Thursday to revive the bill after Republican Senator Jane Shamp, who had voted against it, filed a motion to reconsider. The reconsideration vote in the Senate followed party lines almost entirely, with Republican Jake Hoffman as the lone GOP member opposing the bill. At that time, it passed the Senate in a 16-14 vote. Arizona could also claim abandoned digital assets Under the terms of HB 2324, the first $300,000 in digital assets seized during a criminal forfeiture would go to the Attorney General’s office. Any value beyond that threshold would be divided so that 50 percent continues to the Attorney General, 25 percent moves into the state general fund, and the remaining 25 percent is deposited into the new reserve fund. The bill, sponsored by Republican Senator Jeff Weninger, also broadens Arizona’s forfeiture statutes to cover digital assets. It lays out rules for seizing, storing, and allocating these assets. The state of Arizona could claim digital assets from individuals who are deceased, deported, have fled, have gained immunity, or have abandoned it. Of course, officials will have to prove that there is no known owner, that they made diligent efforts to find one, and that no one else has stepped forward to claim it. Earlier this month, on May 7, Governor Hobbs also signed HB 2749 into law. That measure similarly permits Arizona to retain unclaimed cryptocurrency and form a Bitcoin reserve fund without tapping taxpayer dollars or state funds.

2025-06-25T05:34:20,"Senators Skip Key Crypto Hearing as Political Divides Deepen","The goal of the session was to advance a bipartisan market structure bill, but it ended up highlighting political tensions as there was only one Democrat present. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is reportedly preparing an executive order to prevent banks from debanking crypto firms, after accusations of politically motivated discrimination known as “Operation Chokepoint 2.0.” However, the Federal Reserve announced it will no longer consider “reputational risk” in bank oversight, which was a policy that was criticized for harming crypto companies. Low Turnout at Senate Hearing Raises Doubts A recent US Senate hearing that was intended to explore bipartisan legislative frameworks for digital asset market structure saw very low attendance, with only five of the 11 members of the Senate Banking Committee’s digital assets subcommittee present. The hearing was chaired by Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis, and featured testimony from former regulators and industry leaders, including former CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam, Coinbase legal executive Ryan VanGrack, Multicoin Capital’s Greg Xethalis, and Wharton School’s Sarah Hammer. Lummis pointed to the scheduling of multiple competing committee meetings as a possible reason for the poor turnout but expressed concern about the lack of bipartisan engagement on digital asset legislation. (Source: US Senate Banking Committee ) The hearing focused on the development of a Senate bill, which goal is to establish a clear market structure for digital assets, building on the recent passage of the GENIUS Act, a bipartisan stablecoin bill. Despite the earlier cooperative momentum, Lummis raised questions about the growing partisanship surrounding crypto legislation. She hinted at potential political motivations, and suggested that concerns over certain administration members’ family ties to the crypto industry might be influencing Democratic resistance. Democratic Senator Angela Alsobrooks was the only member from her party present at the hearing, filling in for Ranking Member Ruben Gallego. Alsobrooks supported the GENIUS Act and played a role in advancing it. Meanwhile, Republican Senator Bernie Moreno echoed concerns about why crypto legislation has become such a partisan issue, although no direct references were made to President Donald Trump or specific people in the administration. The Senate’s proposed digital asset market structure legislation complements parallel efforts in the House, where the CLARITY Act was recently moved out of committee and is expected to be put to a floor vote. While several Democrats previously voted alongside Republicans to advance the GENIUS Act, the broader debate over crypto regulation in Congress is still very much colored by political suspicion and questions of transparency. Trump Eyes Action Against Crypto Debanking Despite the rising political tensions, the Trump administration is reportedly considering issuing an executive order to prevent banks from cutting off services to politically disfavored industries, including cryptocurrency firms. According to a report from The Wall Street Journal, the proposed move is in response to concerns that financial institutions have been selectively denying services to crypto and tech entrepreneurs in what critics have labeled “Operation Chokepoint 2.0.” The alleged debanking campaign began under former President Joe Biden’s administration, with at least 30 technology and crypto founders reportedly affected. Major banks like JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo recently met with state officials in Texas and Oklahoma to address allegations of discrimination against industries like firearms manufacturing and fossil fuels. Naturally, the issue attracted a lot of bipartisan attention. In February, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren urged the Trump administration to intervene after saying that no one should be denied banking access based on political views or industry affiliation. The topic gained renewed urgency after the collapse of three crypto-friendly banks—Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate Bank, and Signature Bank—between March 10 and 12, 2023. These closures prompted venture capitalist Nic Carter to characterize the situation as a coordinated attempt to marginalize the crypto industry, dubbing it “Operation Chokepoint 2.0.” Despite a seemingly more supportive stance from the Trump administration, there are still some concerns from within the crypto industry. Caitlin Long , CEO of Custodia Bank, explained that the debanking trend may persist until at least 2026. She pointed out that Trump will not be able to appoint a new Federal Reserve governor until January, which could potentially limit the administration’s influence. Long added that if agencies like the OCC and FDIC roll back their anti-crypto stances but the Fed does not, regulatory uncertainty could continue to hamper the industry. Long’s own bank, Custodia, suffered due to these banking restrictions by losing both time and money. Trump did, however, reaffirmed his plans to end the practice during his comments at the White House Crypto Summit on March 7. Federal Reserve Ends Support for Crypto Debanking Meanwhile, the US Federal Reserve announced a major policy shift by directing its supervisors to stop considering “reputational risk” in the oversight of banks. This is a big win for the cryptocurrency industry, which has long argued that the ambiguous concept of reputational risk was used to justify the debanking of crypto firms under Operation Chokepoint 2.0. In its statement, the Federal Reserve Board said it started reviewing its supervisory materials to remove references to reputational risk and replace them with more specific discussions focused on financial risk. The central bank also plans to train its examiners accordingly and ensure the change is consistently applied across all banks it supervises. Additionally, the Fed is working with other federal banking regulators to promote uniform practices across the regulatory landscape. Despite this move, the Fed clarified that banks are still expected to maintain strong risk management systems and comply with all applicable laws and regulations. The change does not prevent banks from considering reputational risk in their internal risk frameworks; it simply removes the concept from supervisory guidance. The Federal Reserve defined reputational risk as the potential for damage due to negative publicity—accurate or not—that could lead to customer loss, litigation, or revenue decline. The move drew praise from both crypto advocates and banking industry leaders. Senator Cynthia Lummis described the previous reputation risk policy as one that “assassinated American Bitcoin and digital asset businesses,” and called the reversal a win, albeit one that requires more action. Rob Nichols, CEO of the American Bankers Association, also supported the change by saying it would make bank supervision more transparent and grounded in sound financial principles rather than regulatory subjectivity. However, not everyone welcomed the decision. Critics argued that removing reputational risk from oversight could downplay non-financial concerns that affect bank stability, weaken overall supervision, and open the door to potentially riskier practices. This policy shift happened as part of the broader rollback of crypto restrictions by US regulators. In May, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency confirmed that banks under its oversight are allowed to trade crypto and outsource related services. Similarly, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation clarified in March that banks can now engage in crypto-related activities without requiring prior approval.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9695/senators-skip-key-crypto-hearing-as-political-divides-deepen,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

An Analysis Company CEO Comments! “I Can’t Guarantee Anything, But…”","Cryptocurrency analysis firm Alphractal and its CEO Joao Wedson have suggested that a strong altcoin season could be experienced in the third quarter of 2025, drawing attention to the increasing stablecoin liquidity and Bitcoin dominance in the market. According to Alphractal’s analysis, the stablecoin market has been experiencing significant growth in recent weeks. With a total market value approaching $250 billion, stablecoins currently account for around 7.5% of the global cryptocurrency market, with Tether (USDT) taking the largest share. USDT represents more than 66% of all stablecoins. On the other hand, the total market dominance of Bitcoin and stablecoins reached 73.5%. According to experts, this rate is historically considered as the forerunner of a strong accumulation and rise period for the altcoin market. Related News: SEC Issues Update on Anticipated Altcoin Spot ETF – Here's What You Need to Know The company’s CEO, Joao Wedson, claimed that contrary to the negative expectations for the altcoin market, the current conditions have serious potential for growth. According to Wedson, while the majority of investors are still keeping their distance from the altcoin market, the large liquidity available could lead to a surprise rally by turning to these assets. Despite the cautious mood in the market, the Alphractal team believes that a parabolic rally in altcoins is possible starting in the summer of 2025. *This is not investment advice.

While altcoins display stability after rebounding from weekend lows, Arbitrum protocol is in the spotlight after generating $1.42 million in revenue within the last seven days. EntropyAdvisor’s dune dashboard reveals these stats, showing a 23% surge from the previous week. Source: Entropyadvisors The impressive earnings place ARB’s blockchain among the economically viable and active Ethereum L2 ecosystems. This article evaluates how real-world asset (RAW) trends drive Arbitrum’s growth. RAW activity on Arbitrum hits ATHs The network has seen impressive performance over the past week, with its RWA sector hitting new all-time highs above $300 million. RWA protocols bridge decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional finance (TradiFi). They allow individuals to access tokenized versions of real-world assets like bonds, invoices, and real estate on dApps. Economists believe the tokenization sector will be a $16 trillion market by 2030, while others expect tremendous growth to $30 trillion in the next five years. In that context, Arbitrum’s attracting $300 million into this industry demonstrates an increasing appetite among builders and investors to onboard real-world use cases into blockchain systems. Moreover, the milestone confirms Arbitrum’s capability to support low-fee, scalable RWA applications. Furthermore, the impressive RWA adoption reflects magnified investor trust in L2 platforms that offer regulated, yield-bearing, and scalable on-chain financial instruments. The soaring RWA activity possibly fueled on-chain volumes and transaction fees, boosting ARB’s protocol revenue. Ecosystem players propel Arbitrum’s boom Various protocols contributed to Arbitrum’s revenue spike in the past few sessions, highlighting the expanding Arbitrum DeFi landscape. GMX, Ostium Labs, and Gains Network led the charge, earning $550K, $225K, and $120K, respectively. Pendle and Uniswap followed with $85K and $82K. According to Web3 enthusiast Isaac Bassey: These numbers reflect not only strong user activity but also the increasing sophistication of Arbitrum’s ecosystem, which is rapidly evolving with innovative protocols and scaling solutions. The flourishing ecosystem protocols aren’t just facilitating on-chain transactions but also building a revolutionary financial infrastructure. ARB price outlook Arbitrum’s native token exhibited a bullish structure on its daily chart, driven by broad-based recoveries and optimistic ecosystem updates. ARB trades at $0.3149 after touching an intraday high of $0.3334. Chart by Coinmarketcap While bulls fight for short-term control, the alt gas struggled with bearishness lately, down 20% and 60% in the previous month and year. The downside is visible as Arbitrum investors have struggled with losses despite various developers’ efforts to rescue the project from deep slides. However, the prevailing trends suggest impending shifts. As retail and institutional investors join the RWA bandwagon, platforms like Arbitrum stand to enjoy massive benefits. Arbitrum’s status as a scalable Ethereum L2 makes it lucrative for supporting more complex fiscal products, including those linked to off-chain assets. Such a trajectory could make Arbitrum the go-to blockchain for DeFi integration with RWA.

2025-06-25T05:00:38,"Tron’s 374% Profit-Taking Spree Uncovered—Here’s Who Was Behind It","On-chain data shows Tron (TRX) observed a large profit-taking spike earlier in the month. Which type of holder was responsible for the move? Tron SOPR Saw A Huge Spike Earlier In The Month In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, analyst Maartunn has talked about the recent trend in the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) of Tron. The SOPR refers to an on-chain indicator that tells us about whether the TRX investors are moving or selling their coins at a profit or loss. The indicator works by going through the transfer history of each coin being moved to see what price it was last transacted at. Coins that have this cost basis above the current spot price are contributing to loss realization, while those with the opposite setup to profit realization. Related Reading: Crypto Bears Rekt: $359M Gone As Bitcoin, Ethereum Rebound The SOPR takes the ratio between the spent value and cost basis, and sums it up for all coins being sold on the blockchain to find a net situation for the market as a whole. When the value of the indicator is greater than 1, it means the investors are, on average, realizing a profit through their transactions. On the other hand, the metric being under this threshold suggests the dominance of loss realization in the market. Now, here is the chart shared by the quant that shows the trend in the Tron SOPR over the past year: As displayed in the above graph, the Tron SOPR saw a huge spike above the 1 mark earlier in the month, implying investors took part in a significant amount of profit-taking. From the chart, it’s also visible that there were other profit realization spikes during the past year, but the current one stands out for its scale. The latest peak in the metric saw its value go to 4.74, corresponding to a profit margin of 374%. “With TRX priced at $0.268 at the time, the average acquisition price for those coins would have been around $0.0566,” explains Maartunn. Interestingly, Tron hasn’t seen extended periods around this price mark since late 2022, meaning that the tokens would have been held for a good while before being finally transacted this month. Usually, when dormant hands break their silence, it’s likely to be for selling-related purposes. That said, it’s not the only reason they may do so. “The activity could be tied to early investors realizing gains, internal transfers, or reallocation decisions,” notes the analyst.
