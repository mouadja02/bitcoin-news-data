2025-06-25T11:56:10,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Top Analyst Eyeing $140K","The post Bitcoin Price Prediction: Top Analyst Eyeing $140K appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After a shaky start to the week, Bitcoin has bounced back strongly, now trading around $107,000 with a 5% recovery. But according to popular crypto analyst Crypto Rover, this could be just the beginning. He believes Bitcoin is preparing for its next major breakout, and this one might send prices soaring to $140,000. Bitcoin Price Eying $140k In a recent tweet post, crypto analyst Crypto Rove r believes Bitcoin is currently forming a bullish pattern known as a “bull flag,” which often leads to explosive upward moves in past Bitcoin cycles. He notes that Bitcoin has now spent nearly 200 days in sideways consolidation, a phase very similar to ones seen before earlier bull runs. In his view, once Bitcoin breaks past the $110,000 resistance, the path to $130K–$140K could open up rapidly. “This could be the final run-up,” Rover said, calling it “the most hated rally” as many remain skeptical during the consolidation phase. On-Chain Data Supports the Breakout Adding to Rover’s bullish thesis, data from CryptoQuant reveals that only 40,000 BTC per day is currently being sent to exchanges, the lowest level seen in over a decade. Historically, such low flows have coincided with market bottoms and the start of major rallies, including in 2016, 2019, and most recently in 2023. At the same time, Bitcoin spot ETFs are showing strong institutional demand. According to Fairside data , there have now been two consecutive weeks of inflows, with $588.55 million added on June 24 alone. Ethereum Eyeing $4000 Mark While the spotlight is on Bitcoin, Crypto Rover also has high hopes for Ethereum (ETH). Backed by a $4.4 million long position, he expects ETH to rise significantly, especially with signs of heavy accumulation from institutions like BlackRock. He has predicted that the ETH price could range between $2,600 and $4,000, depending on how the breakout unfolds. He further added that current funding rates on both BTC and ETH are near zero or even negative, another classic sign of a bullish bottom forming.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-top-analyst-eyeing-140k/,"BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","News",cryptocompare

2025-06-25T11:45:46,"Analyst Says $170,000 Bitcoin Is Closer Than You Think, BTC Approaching ‘Steep Part’ of Cycle","A popular crypto analyst believes Bitcoin ( BTC ) will hit the $170,000 mark sooner than most expect. Pseudonymous analyst TechDev tells his 532,100 followers on the social media platform X that after a correction into the $90,000 range, Bitcoin may soon increase more than 60% from its current value. “$95,000 would make sense structurally. Then $170,000 is closer than you think.” TechDev’s bullish case is based on several indicators. He believes Bitcoin’s cycles have been correlated to the performance of the overall macroeconomy. Based on his chart and historical patterns, the analyst suggests the business cycle is bottoming and may start to increase, which has coincided with massive Bitcoin rallies in 2013, 2017 and 2021, when the flagship crypto asset hit the cycle peaks. “Re-evaluate your top calls.” Source: TechDev/X TechDev also uses the copper-to-gold ratio as a reliable signal pointing to a likely massive Bitcoin surge. The copper/gold ratio, often viewed as a proxy for economic risk appetite, has formed a bottom similar to 2020 and 2016, which preceded BTC bull runs, the analyst says. “The steep part lies ahead.” Source: TechDev/X The analyst previously said the M2 money supply’s year-over-year change is pointing to a brewing Bitcoin surge. The global M2 money supply – a key indicator of liquidity in the world’s financial system – has shifted from negative to positive annual growth. According to the analyst, this shift has historically preceded each of Bitcoin’s parabolic rallies by six to ten months, indicating a strong likelihood that a new upward cycle is approaching. Bitcoin is trading for $106,093 at time of writing, up 2.2% in the last 24 hours.

2025-06-25T11:40:43,"Why Is Crypto Down Today? – June 25, 2025","After a day of significant increases, the crypto market is down today. The majority of the top 100 coins have dropped over the past 24 hours. Moreover, the cryptocurrency market capitalization has fallen by 1.6% in that period to $3.4 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $99.8 billion. TLDR: The crypto market makes a turn back into red; Most top 100 coins saw price drops: BTC and ETH appreciated less than 1% each, trading at $106,413 and $2,443, respectively; Markets reacted to de-escalation in the Middle East, with higher-risk assets benefiting; ’Some are focused on short-term corrections, but Bitcoin is ultimately on the rise’; The market remains cautious; Geopolitical risks persists, as does the risk of investors turning away from risk assets. Crypto Winners & Losers Six of the top 10 coins per market cap are up, but with low increases of less than 1% per coin. Bitcoin (BTC) appreciated by 0.7%, now trading at $106,413. This is up from $101,924 seen two days ago. Furthermore, Ethereum (ETH) appreciated by 0.8%, changing hands at $2,443. It’s one of the category’s best performers again today. Lido Staked Ether (STETH) and Tron (TRX) also recorded a 0.8% rise each. XRP (XRP) recorded the highest decrease in this category of 0.7% to the price of $2.18. Moreover, the majority of the top 100 coins saw their prices drop over the past day. The highest decrease among these is Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL)’s 8.5% to $1.56. On the other hand, Pi Network (PI) appreciated the most today: 13.4% to $0.5998. This is the only double-digit change in this category. Aptos (APT) follows with a 9% rise to $4.83. Notably, the market has cooled off following several positive news seen yesterday. The prices saw a swift uptick yesterday after Japan’s Financial Services Agency proposed to reclassify digital assets under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, which could cut crypto taxes from 55% to 20% and increase chances for spot ETFs.

This could legalise #Bitcoin ETFs and cut tax on crypto gains. pic.twitter.com/m0qmWWVnx3 — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) June 24, 2025 Moreover, recent macroeconomic changes and lower geopolitical risks, specifically the announced ceasefire between Israel and Iran, boosted the crypto market, with investors turning their attention to risk assets again. The fragile agreement seems to be holding for now, though the information coming from Israel, the US, and Iran is not exactly clear. At the same time, Israel has continued the genocide in Gaza. Israeli forces continue their war on Gaza, killing Palestinians, as US President Donald Trump announces a ceasefire between Israel and Iran.

That said, the dip is “not a long-term concern and is merely a distraction from Bitcoin’s true trajectory,” Harz says. “While some are fixated on short-term corrections, it is undeniable that Bitcoin, and particularly Bitcoin DeFi, is ultimately on the rise.” It’s certain that Bitcoin is actively maturing and entering a phase defined by institutional adoption, clearer regulation, and rapid technological progress, he says. This is because Bitcoin’s utility, says Harz. Institutions don’t just want to hold Bitcoin, but put it to work too. Moreover, Gadi Chait, Head of Investment at Xapo Bank , argued that Bitcoin’s safe-haven asset status is still taking shape. However, “recent signals suggest it’s edging closer.” “Traditionally seen as volatile, Bitcoin’s response to recent macro shocks, like the events in the Middle East, has been notably restrained, neither tracking gold perfectly nor mirroring equity sell-offs,” says Chait. Geopolitical shocks often trigger an initial flight to cash, but Chait says that “the combination of institutional rallies and macro-driven bids now means that dips are shallower and recoveries faster than in previous cycles.” “In recent market downturns, Bitcoin’s relatively shallow pullbacks, which have been paired with consistent institutional inflows, point to a shift in perception. Its increasing correlation with gold suggests it’s being viewed as a store of value, while on the other hand, its rapid rebounds reflect its growing integration into mainstream finance,” Chait concludes. Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, BTC trades at $106,413. Over the last day, the price gradually increased from the daily low of $104,854 to the intraday high of $106,691. The coin has surpassed the $106,000 level. Investors now wait to see if it will break the $107,500 level next, or possibly drop below $104,000. These moves would open doors for further price rises or drops. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView At the same time, Ethereum is currently trading at $2,443. It jumped to the intraday high of $2,473 before decreasing to $2,428 overnight (UTC). Meanwhile, the crypto market sentiment remained in neutral territory after exiting the fear zone yesterday.

The crypto market saw a shift to red developing since last night, while the stock market saw increases on Tuesday. The S&P 500 went up by 1.11%, the Nasdaq-100 increased by 1.53%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 1.19%. The stock market reacted directly to a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran. Is this dip sustainable? The market shows caution. There is no panic to speak of yet, and analysts are bullish in the long term, but the unstable global situation can still pull the prices lower.

2025-06-25T11:40:39,"XRP News: Bybit Reports XRP Holdings Double in Just 6 Months","The post XRP News: Bybit Reports XRP Holdings Double in Just 6 Months appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Rising tensions between Israel and Iran have created market uncertainty, leading investors to favor safer assets like Bitcoin and pushing its dominance to 65.30%, while altcoins lag. However, a recent Bybit report reveals a shift in sentiment, with XRP standing out as a strong altcoin contender. From November to May, XRP holdings on the platform more than doubled, and its price surged by 338%, from $0.50 to $2.19. This rise came as legal pressures between Ripple vs SEC eased , boosting confidence among retail and institutional investors. Despite the broader market favoring Bitcoin, XRP is now gaining momentum as traders begin shifting focus to its growing potential. XRP ETF Approval Hopes Fuel NEW: @EricBalchunas & I are raising our odds for the vast majority of the spot crypto ETF filings to 90% or higher. Engagement from the SEC is a very positive sign in our opinion pic.twitter.com/5dh8G8rK6Y — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) June 20, 2025 Another boost came from speculation over an XRP spot ETF . According to prediction platform Polymarket, there’s an 85% chance of approval this year. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart is even more optimistic, placing the odds at 95%. Although President Trump’s comments about XRP becoming part of a U.S. crypto reserve didn’t pan out, they still helped fuel interest. Bybit noted that XRP’s holding percentage jumped from 1.29% to 2.42% in just six months. Bitcoin Remains King Despite XRP’s impressive gains , Bitcoin remains the clear market leader. Bybit’s data shows that 30.95% of assets held by users are in BTC. For every $1 of ETH held, there’s $4 in BTC. Bitcoin dominance has risen from 53.2% to 64% over the past year, while Ether’s share dropped from 18% to 9%. The concentration of BTC and ETH fell to 48.2% in early 2025 but bounced back to 58.8% by May, showing strong investor confidence. Institutions Still Opting for BTC and ETH The report reveals a clear divide between institutional and retail investor strategies. As of May 2025, retail traders held just 11.64% in BTC and 6.8% in ETH, nearly half the institutional holdings. This gap points to the cautious approach institutions take, favoring regulated large caps, while retail players remain more experimental. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Top Two ‘Whale Approved’ Altcoins To Buy Now , Altseason Delayed? Altcoins have struggled recently, with the Altcoin Season Index dropping to 12 after stabilising at 17, its lowest in two years. Interest in smaller cryptocurrencies dropped sharply, from 35.2% in November to 23.5% in May. Meme coins and DeFi tokens held up relatively well, but AI tokens, GameFi, and NFTs saw declines. Despite Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high in May, altcoins failed to rally, suggesting that the traditional “altseason” is either delayed or canceled for now. This signals a strong Bitcoin season, where BTC outperforms top 50 altcoins. Institutions are favoring major assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP, pouring capital into ETFs and related investment products instead of rotating into smaller altcoins. Hopes for an altcoin rally have faded for now, as big players stick to the more established names. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

No, XRP itself is not a stablecoin. XRP’s price fluctuates with market supply and demand. However, Ripple (the company behind XRP) recently launched its own USD-backed stablecoin called RLUSD. Why is Bitcoin’s dominance increasing amidst market uncertainty? Rising global tensions, like those between Israel and Iran, lead investors to seek safer assets. Bitcoin is perceived as “digital gold,” causing capital to flow into BTC and increasing its market dominance. What are the chances of a spot XRP ETF being approved? Prediction platform Polymarket puts the approval odds at 85% this year, while Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart is even more optimistic at 95%, citing positive SEC engagement.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-news-bybit-reports-xrp-holdings-double-in-just-6-months/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|XRP","News|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

Bitcoin dropped below $100K, and several altcoins, including Ethereum, Hyperliquid, Cardano, and Virtuals, plunged 20–30%. But on the contrary, whales and institutions are buying aggressively. Altcoin Buzz discussed this behavior in a recent video, highlighting how smart money is taking advantage of the dip while retail sentiment turns negative. Whales Are Buying the Dip Bitcoin, in particular, is showing strong signs of accumulation. Wallets holding 10 BTC or more are increasing while smaller wallets are shrinking. When large wallets are buying and retail investors are losing confidence, it is the perfect setup for bullish momentum to return to the crypto market. Bitcoin's elite vs. mortal wallets are moving in two different directions as its market value sits just north of $104.3K.

MicroStrategy also added another $26 million worth of Bitcoin recently. Bitcoin ETFs have almost bought $1 billion BTC in the past 2 days. On June 24, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $589 million in net inflows, marking the 11th straight day of gains. Bitcoin ETFs are buying 3x more than the weekly mined supply, a clear sign that a supply shock may be coming soon. LINK and ADA See Heavy Accumulation Chainlink is also catching the attention of big investors. While most projects drop in price after a token unlock, LINK often sees a price rise. Whales are buying even at higher prices. Data from Santiment shows that LINK jumped 11% today as the number of holders hit a new all-time high at 769,380. Additionally, active wallets over the past year are down 17.3% which shows that long-term holders see this as a prime buying opportunity.

2025-06-25T11:33:12,"Bitcoin Price USD Will Dip to $97K Before Possible Surge to $130K","The post Bitcoin Price USD Will Dip to $97K Before Possible Surge to $130K appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin is flashing bullish signals once again—and a major breakout could be just around the corner. After posting a solid 29.2% gain in Q2 so far, BTC might be gearing up for its next leg up, according to crypto analysts on X. Bitcoin Price Performance in Q2 2025 Q2 Growth: 29.2% so far April Return: 14.2% May Return: 11.1% June Return (so far): 1.90% In May, Bitcoin climbed from $94,177.90 to touch a monthly high of $111,704 on May 22. But after hitting that peak, BTC retraced 9.11% between May 23 and June 5. A brief rebound of 8.61% followed between June 6 and 10—but the price couldn’t break the previous swing high. Between June 11 and 22, Bitcoin dipped again by 8.46%, only to bounce 1.2% in the last 24 hours—hinting at possible renewed momentum. Bullish Flag Pattern Forming: Analyst Insight Crypto analyst Caption Faibik , in a recent post on X, revealed that Bitcoin is forming a classic bullish flag pattern—a continuation setup that often signals the next leg of a bull run. “Before the next surge, BTC may briefly dip to the $97K–$98K range,” says Faibik. “Once it breaks past the $108K resistance, the rally toward $130K is likely.” The bullish flag pattern features: A strong upward move (the flagpole) A slight downward or sideways consolidation (the flag) A breakout above the flag’s upper boundary signals continuation of the trend Bitcoin’s Key Levels to Watch Support Zone: $97,000–$98,000 Breakout Level: $108,000 Midterm Target Post-Breakout: $130,000 Experts agree that a strong daily close above $108K will confirm the bullish breakout and could open the doors to the much-anticipated six-figure surge. BTC Community Reacts: Dip Before the Rocket? Crypto analyst Chainbull and several BTC enthusiasts echo Faibik’s prediction, believing that the current dip is a healthy consolidation before the next leg up. If Bitcoin follows the expected pattern, a breakout to $130K could become the dominant narrative going into Q3.The charts suggest Bitcoin isn’t done yet. A short dip could lead to a major breakout—and BTC could be heading to $130K sooner than expected. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-25T11:32:44,"Bluebird Mining secures Bitcoin funding as Philippine gold deal nears completion","Bluebird Mining is accelerating its pivot to digital assets with a £2 million funding facility to buy Bitcoin, timed just as it finalizes a gold profit-sharing agreement in the Philippines. On June 25, Bluebird Mining Ventures Ltd, a London-listed gold miner, has secured a £2 million funding facility, with £1 million available immediately, to begin implementing its Bitcoin Treasury strategy. The facility is structured as a zero-interest loan, maturing on 31 Dec. 2026, with the option for the lender to convert the debt into Bluebird shares at 2 pence per share. The funds will be used to purchase Bitcoin ( BTC ), marking the company’s entry into digital asset holdings alongside its core business in gold mining. You might also like: The Smarter Web Company boosts Bitcoin holdings to 346 BTC after doubling fundraising target The timing of the funding coincides with Bluebird’s June 24 announcement that it’s finalizing a gold project agreement in the Philippines. Under the deal, the company will receive a 10% profit share and bonus royalty payments. This aligns directly with Bluebird’s recently stated strategy to convert future gold revenues into Bitcoin.

2025-06-25T11:28:08,"Crypto Stocks Soar as Iran-Israel Ceasefire Holds – Best New Crypto to Buy","US crypto stocks are rallying following US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a phased ceasefire between Iran and Israel. The pause in fighting was initially set to begin June 24, but the truce was broken within an hour: Iran allegedly fired missiles, while Israel launched strikes near Tehran. Trump quickly stepped in, blasting both nations to stand down. So far, the two sides appear to be toeing the line, and with easing geopolitical tensions, crypto stocks like Coinbase and Riot have surged. Now may be an opportune time to explore new crypto to buy, and we’ve found some hot picks. World War 3 Cancelled, Coinbase Stocks Jump 12.10% Tensions between Iran and Israel flared on June 13 after Israel struck Iranian nuclear sites. In response, Iran fired missiles at Israel. The US then joined the conflict, launching major airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities on June 22. Iran retaliated by striking a US base in Qatar the following day. Iran and Israel then launched new attacks on each other, going against Trump’s orders for a ‘peace agreement’ – a phased truce brokered by the US and Qatar. The US president wasn’t impressed, stating both countries ‘don’t know what the f**k they’re doing.’ While tentative, the ceasefire appears to be holding and has been enough to boost market risk appetite. Since yesterday, Coinbase stocks have jumped 12.58% . Meanwhile, crypto mining firm Riot Platforms has surged 8.09% , and Marathon Digital Holdings is up by 4.94% . This could make now a timely moment to buy into the next crypto to explode . Our top choices right now include Snorter Token ($SNORT) , Maple Finance ($SYRUP), and Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) . 1. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Crypto Trading Bot on Telegram Boasting Ultra Low Fees (Just 0.85%!) If you’re looking for hot crypto opportunities as investors shift back toward riskier assets, Snorter Token ($SNORT) is worth eyeing. $SNORT is the native token of Snorter Bot, a Telegram-based crypto trading bot getting set to launch in Q3 2025. Built for speed and affordability, it’ll help you sniff out trending tokens, set stop-loss and take-profit limits, and avoid scams. For more information, check out our What is Snorter guide . Currently focused on Solana, boasting the lowest bot fees on the network at just 0.85%, it plans to expand across all major Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains. Beyond premium features and low fees, $SNORT also gives you access to staking rewards (currently at a 260% APY), plus voting rights. Having a say in the platform’s governance means you can share your ideas on future developments to help boost its sustainability. $SNORT is already gaining serious traction. It’s raised over $1.2M on presale, with a helping hand from three major whales who injected $40K , $10.8K , and $10K into the project. You can buy $SNORT for as little as $0.0961. After being listed on crypto exchanges, it’s expected to hit $0.94 . So, if you act now, you could position yourself for 879% returns. 2. Maple Finance ($SYRUP) – Decentralized Corporate Credit Market Built on Solana & Ethereum Maple Finance ($SYRUP) is up 18.16% since yesterday, following the easing of the risk of a larger, wider Israel-Iran war. Put simply, Maple Finance is a decentralized corporate credit market. Operating on Solana and Ethereum, it offers an efficient bridge for borrowers to access unsecured capital while providing lucrative yield opportunities for lenders. The entire lending process, from loan origination to repayment, is recorded on-chain to ensure transparency and accountability. $SYRUP, previously known as $MPL, is a utility and governance token that powers the Maple Finance ecosystem. Upon buying the token, it can be staked to earn a portion of the revenue generated from loan originations and interest payments. Plus, you can participate in critical decisions regarding free structures and new product rollouts. You can buy $SYRUP on some of the best crypto exchanges , including Binance and MEXC , for roughly $0.60. 3. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Layer 2 to Boost Bitcoin’s Speed, Scalability & dApp Power $HYPER is the utility token of Bitcoin Hyper, an innovative Layer 2 (L2) network designed to solve the Bitcoin network’s biggest challenges – limited scalability, slow transactions, and high fees. Also launching in Q3 2025, it will integrate the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to enable lightning-fast smart contracts and scalable dApps on top of Bitcoin’s secure base layer. To connect seamlessly with Bitcoin’s mainnet, the network will use a canonical bridge . This means you’ll be able to wrap and transfer $BTC into the Hyper ecosystem. What’s more, the protocol operates on its own Proof-of-Stake (PoS) validator network. It’s being built to handle transactions and smart contracts with high efficiency and sustainability. Considering that $HYPER sets 30% of its total token supply to development, the L2 should materialize as promised and only improve over time. $SNORT is already attracting significant attention, raising $1.6M in its presale. Early whale buyers of $74.9K , $54.1K , and $53.9K have added to the buzz. Right now, you can buy $HYPER on presale for just $0.012025. You can also stake it at a sizable 481% APY. You can also anticipate possible gains of up to 2,561%, as its price might reach $0.32 following the L2’s launch this year. New Crypto to Buy Amid Geopolitical Volatility While the Iran-Israeli truce remains fragile, the crypto market is responding positively to the ceasefire, even though it may only be temporary. As fears of a full-scale war ease, investors are once again turning their attention to risk-on strategies. In turn, this has fueled a rebound in crypto stocks, making now a favorable time to invest in crypto. Are you interested in a new crypto trading bot, passive income through interest payments, or unlocking Bitcoin’s full potential? If so, $SNORT , $SYRUP, and $HYPER are worth checking out. This isn’t investment advice. Always do your homework and only invest what you can afford to lose.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/new-crypto-to-buy-as-stocks-soar-after-ceasefire/,"AAVE|ADA|ALGO|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CFX|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Crypto News",cryptocompare
2025-06-25T11:25:54,"Crypto Stocks Surge as Iran-Israel Ceasefire Holds—For Now","U.S. crypto stocks rallied sharply on Tuesday after a tentative ceasefire between Iran and Israel , brokered by President Donald Trump, managed to hold despite early violations. The broader financial markets also posted gains, with investors seemingly relieved that the Middle East tensions had not escalated further—at least for the moment. Trump declared the ceasefire on social media late Monday, boldly asserting it would “go on forever.” However, both nations reportedly exchanged missile fire soon after the agreement took effect. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Trump criticized the behavior of both countries. “We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don’t know what the fuck they’re doing,” he said. Coinbase Leads S&P 500 Gains as Robinhood Follows Among crypto stocks, Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) emerged as the standout performer. The crypto exchange closed the day with a 12.10% gain, making it the top gainer in the S&P 500 index. Mining companies also saw strong advances, with Riot Platforms rising 8.09%, Marathon Digital climbing 4.94%, and MicroStrategy—led by Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor—adding 2.68%, according to Google Finance. Robinhood Markets, Inc. (HOOD) also benefited from the renewed optimism, posting a 7.41% gain. The retail brokerage’s uptick coincided with the launch of a new promotional campaign offering a 1% crypto deposit match, which runs through July 7. The S&P 500 itself rose 1.11% on the day, signaling broad market confidence even amid geopolitical uncertainties. Analysts noted that risk-on sentiment returned as fears of full-scale conflict between Iran and Israel temporarily eased. Mixed Reaction Across Crypto Stocks Despite the surge, not all crypto stocks participated in the rally. Stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Group (CRCL) fell 15.49% during Tuesday’s session. Still, the newly listed company remains up nearly 620% since debuting on June 6 at $31. Meanwhile, the crypto market held steady. Bitcoin gained 1.20% over the past 24 hours to trade at $106,487, while Ether rose 1.99% and XRP climbed 1.92%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The rising investor interest in digital asset firms has encouraged others to consider going public. On June 23, reports surfaced that leading crypto exchange OKX is exploring a U.S. listing following its return to the American market.

2025-06-25T11:24:29,"Ripple Was Born Before Bitcoin? 2004 Evidence Shocks Crypto Community","The post Ripple Was Born Before Bitcoin? 2004 Evidence Shocks Crypto Community appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A newly surfaced document shared by XRP community member SMOQE has caught the crypto world by surprise – suggesting that Ripple’s roots go all the way back to 2004, four years before Bitcoin was created. The document includes a 2014 email exchange between several industry insiders, including tech journalist Reutzel Bailey. In it, Bailey points out that Ripple’s concept existed even before Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin whitepaper in 2008, raising new questions about who really started the digital finance revolution. 2014 E-mails confirm: “Ripple is older than Bitcoin.” pic.twitter.com/9c8cOF4065 — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) June 24, 2025 Ripple’s Early Days According to Bailey, it was Ryan Fugger who first came up with Ripple in 2004. He created a platform called RipplePay to let people move value peer-to-peer, without relying on banks. However, it was Chris Larsen, now Ripple’s co-founder, who later took the project to the next level. Bailey believes Larsen tapped into the growing hype around Bitcoin to reframe Ripple as a cryptocurrency. “Larsen pushed this [Ripple] as a cryptocurrency to catch attention because the platform itself was not really about cryptocurrency at all,” Bailey said. Debunking the Copycat Myth The email conversation also dismantles claims that Ripple mimicked Bitcoin. Industry voice Jeffrey Cliff firmly stated , “Ripple predates Bitcoin,” countering concepts of Ripple as a “ copycat math-based currency .” Furthermore, Ripple’s concept emerged in 2004, and its cryptocurrency, XRP, was launched in 2012, which was four years after Bitcoin’s 2008 debut. This timeline firms Bitcoin as the first cryptocurrency, even as Ripple claims an earlier ideological spark. From RipplePay to the XRP Ledger In 2011, developers Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz began building the XRP Ledger (XRPL). They aimed to create something more efficient than Bitcoin, especially by avoiding its energy-heavy proof-of-work system. McCaleb reached out to Fugger and convinced him to turn RipplePay into a crypto network. That led to the creation of NewCoin in 2012, which was soon renamed OpenCoin , and later simply Ripple . The XRPL creators gave 80 billion XRP to Ripple. McCaleb personally received 9.5 billion XRP, which he sold off gradually – completing his exit in 2022. After leaving Ripple, he went on to co-found Stellar. Meanwhile, Chris Larsen stayed on and still serves as Ripple’s chairman today. A Legacy Beyond Bitcoin While Bitcoin may hold the title of the first true cryptocurrency, Ripple’s earlier origins show that the idea of decentralized value transfer was already taking shape years before. Today, as Ripple continues to innovate in cross-border payments, this rediscovered history adds depth to its role in the crypto world, reminding us that Ripple wasn’t just another Bitcoin competitor, but possibly one of the first to imagine a world beyond banks.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/ripple-was-born-before-bitcoin-2004-evidence-shocks-crypto-community/,"BTC|EXCHANGE|WALLET|XRP","News",cryptocompare

2025-06-25T11:15:00,"Crypto Daybook Americas: Bitcoin Nears $107K as Ceasefire Lifts Markets, Powell Eyed","By Francisco Rodrigues (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Crypto prices rose on Wednesday, riding the same relief wave that lifted global equities after Iran and Israel accepted a U.S.-brokered ceasefire. With the threat of an immediate oil supply crunch fading, traders moved back into risk assets. The price of bitcoin BTC rose to near $107,000, adding 1.7% in the past 24 hours. The broader CoinDesk 20 ( CD20 ) index gained 1%. That advance may be short-lived. “’Optimism about the fragile ceasefire holding between Iran and Israel has bubbled through markets, lifting equities, but more doubts are now creeping in about the truce holding,” said Susannah Streeter, the head of money markets at Hargreaves Lansdown. “A leaked report from U.S. Intelligence casting doubt on the effectiveness of the U.S. strikes in crippling Tehran’s nuclear capabilities, has led to some worries that military action could resume,” she said. Still, the ceasefire wasn’t the only reason for the rally. On Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told House lawmakers that the central bank is being patient before moving forward with interest-rate cuts. Powell pointed out that inflation is still elevated and could face additional pressure from tariffs in coming months. “Powell’s emphasis on a wait-and-see” approach underscores short-term uncertainty in rate policy,” Bitunix analysts wrote in an emailed statement. “The remarks provide markets with flexibility and are overall supportive of risk assets, but investors should closely monitor upcoming tariff developments and inflation data.” U.S. consumer-confidence data softened , pulling two-year Treasury yields to a six-week low of 3.78% and raising the perceived chances of a rate cut in July to about 20%, according to the CME’s FedWatch tool. That's up from about 13% a week ago. On Polymarket , traders are weighing an 18% chance of a cut. Powell will later today testify before a Senate committee. Traders will keep a close eye on the testimony, which comes as President Donald Trump keeps pressure on the Fed to lower interest rates, posting yesterday they should be “at least two to three points lower.” Crypto derivatives desks show a neutral approach around the 27 June expiry: Traders sold straddles and short puts close to $105,000 and $100,000, suggesting an expectation of tight price action, Jake O, OTC trader at Wintermute, said. Call option buying eyeing $108,000 and $112,000 for July and September points, however, to a modest bullish inclination, Jake added. Stay alert!

The last “White Brick” was placed anonymously, slotted right between two CryptoPunks, cementing meme culture into NFT history. The collector called MOG “the natural heir” to the NFT movement, linking punk provenance to memetic momentum. Artist Lorenzo Masnah said the mural’s punchline was intentional: “And I was excited to put this laughing cat up there because if you don’t quite understand memeconomics—the future of digital currency and art—JOKE’S ON YOU!” The Joycat image marks a symbolic shift from identity-driven NFTs to pure cultural velocity. The NFT Wall now stands as a prophecy and landmark as a snapshot of crypto’s chaotic, creative and ungovernable future. Derivatives Positioning The annualized three-month BTC futures basis on offshore exchanges has advanced slightly to 5% as sentiment stabilizes with BTC's quick rebound above $100K. The level, however, remains below May highs above 7%. A similar pattern is seen in ETH. BTC and ETH basis on the CME remain below 10%, with ETH slightly pricier than BTC. Perpetual funding rates for most major coins, including BCH and APT, continue to paint a moderately bullish picture. On Deribit, the BTC put-call ratio rose, at least in part due to investor interest in cash-secured puts, a yield-generation strategy. Flows tracked by Wintermute suggest rangeplay between $100K-$105K ahead of Friday's expiry.

2025-06-25T11:10:50,"ProCap BTC’s Bold Move: Anthony Pompliano’s Firm Files SEC 8-K for Monumental Public Listing and $1 Billion Bitcoin Acquisition","BitcoinWorld ProCap BTC’s Bold Move: Anthony Pompliano’s Firm Files SEC 8-K for Monumental Public Listing and $1 Billion Bitcoin Acquisition The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with anticipation as a significant development unfolds, signaling a deepening convergence between traditional finance and the burgeoning digital asset space. At the heart of this excitement is the latest move by ProCap BTC , a firm founded by the influential American entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano , which has officially initiated steps to become a publicly traded entity. This strategic maneuver promises to reshape the landscape of institutional crypto investment, bringing a prominent Bitcoin advocate’s vision to the public markets. Understanding the Significance of This SEC Filing : What Does an 8-K Mean? An 8-K filing is a crucial document submitted by public companies to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It’s essentially a ‘current report’ that companies must file to announce major events that shareholders should know about. For ProCap BTC, this 8-K filing is not just a formality; it’s a declaration of intent, outlining their strategic merger with Columbus Circle Capital Corp. This move is a pivotal step towards establishing ProCap Financial as a new publicly traded entity, set to list under the ticker symbol CCCM. This type of filing is typically used for significant corporate events, such as changes in control, acquisitions, or in this case, a definitive merger agreement that paves the way for a public listing. The SEC’s oversight in such mergers ensures transparency and investor protection. While the crypto space often operates with a degree of decentralization, any entity seeking to bridge into traditional capital markets must navigate stringent regulatory frameworks. ProCap BTC’s proactive engagement with the SEC demonstrates a commitment to legitimacy and compliance, which could set a precedent for other crypto-native firms eyeing public markets. This regulatory dance is complex, given the SEC’s evolving stance on digital assets. For a company primarily focused on Bitcoin, which the SEC generally considers a commodity, the path might be clearer than for those dealing with tokens deemed securities. Nevertheless, the entire process, from initial filings to eventual listing, demands meticulous adherence to corporate governance and disclosure standards. This adherence to regulatory processes is vital for building trust among institutional investors and the broader public, who may still view the crypto market with skepticism. It signifies a maturation of the industry, moving from niche speculative assets to mainstream financial instruments. The very act of filing an 8-K signals a company’s readiness to open its books and operations to public scrutiny, a level of transparency often missing in the earlier, less regulated days of crypto. It also provides a foundational legal document for the upcoming public listing, outlining the terms and conditions of the merger and the future operational structure of ProCap Financial. Who is Anthony Pompliano and Why Does His Vision for ProCap BTC Matter? Anthony Pompliano, widely known as ‘Pomp,’ is a prominent figure in the Bitcoin and broader cryptocurrency community. A former Facebook and Snapchat product manager, Pomp transitioned into venture capital and became a vocal advocate for Bitcoin. His influence stems from his engaging content, including his popular ‘Pomp Podcast’ and his active presence on social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter). He has consistently championed Bitcoin as a store of value, a hedge against inflation, and a revolutionary technology capable of disrupting traditional financial systems. His early and consistent support for Bitcoin, even during bear markets, has cemented his reputation as a thought leader in the space, earning him a loyal following among crypto enthusiasts and traditional investors alike. ProCap BTC, under Pompliano’s leadership, was established with a clear vision: to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset economy. The firm has consistently emphasized strategic investment in Bitcoin, reflecting Pompliano’s long-held belief in the cryptocurrency’s long-term potential. This public listing isn’t just about capital; it’s about amplifying ProCap BTC’s mission and making institutional-grade Bitcoin exposure more accessible to a wider array of investors. It’s a move that aligns with his broader narrative of Bitcoin’s inevitable integration into mainstream finance, demonstrating a tangible step towards that future. Pomp’s involvement lends significant credibility to ProCap BTC’s endeavors. His ability to articulate complex crypto concepts to a broad audience, combined with his network in both tech and finance, positions ProCap BTC uniquely for this ambitious public offering. His personal brand is intrinsically linked to the firm’s identity, attracting both retail and institutional interest. When a figure like Pompliano, with his track record and conviction, throws his weight behind such a significant corporate action, it resonates deeply within the crypto community and beyond, signaling confidence in the asset class and potentially inspiring others to follow suit. How Will ProCap BTC Navigate Its Journey to a Public Listing ? The planned merger with Columbus Circle Capital Corp. is the chosen vehicle for ProCap BTC’s public debut. Mergers with existing public shell companies or Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs) have become a popular route for private companies to go public faster than a traditional IPO. While specific financial terms of the merger are still being finalized and will be detailed in subsequent filings, the strategic alignment with Columbus Circle Capital Corp. suggests a synergy aimed at leveraging existing public market infrastructure. Columbus Circle Capital Corp. likely brings a pre-existing public shell, potentially streamlining the listing process and reducing the time and cost associated with a traditional initial public offering (IPO), which can often be a lengthy and expensive undertaking. Upon finalization, the combined entity will operate under the name ProCap Financial, a strategic rebranding that reflects its broader financial ambitions beyond just Bitcoin. This new name signals a potential expansion into other digital asset classes or related financial services in the future, positioning the company as a comprehensive player in the evolving financial landscape. The choice of CCCM as the ticker symbol for the Nasdaq or NYSE listing is a crucial identifier, providing investors with a clear, accessible way to trade shares of the new company. This transition from a private firm to a publicly traded entity introduces new layers of scrutiny, reporting requirements, and corporate governance. Public companies are subject to quarterly and annual reporting, stricter auditing, and greater transparency requirements, which ultimately benefit investors by providing more comprehensive information and accountability. The benefits of going public for ProCap Financial are multi-faceted and extend beyond just raising capital. They include: Enhanced Capital Access: Public companies can raise significant capital through stock offerings, which can fuel growth, expansion, and large-scale investments like the planned Bitcoin acquisition. This capital can also be used for research and development, hiring top talent, or acquiring other businesses, providing a robust financial foundation for future endeavors. Increased Visibility and Credibility: A public listing brings greater public awareness and legitimacy, attracting a wider range of investors, including institutional funds that often have mandates to invest only in publicly traded entities. This increased profile can also enhance business partnerships and customer trust, opening doors to new opportunities. Liquidity for Early Investors: Going public provides an exit strategy for early investors and employees, allowing them to convert their stakes into liquid assets. This liquidity is a strong incentive for venture capitalists and angel investors who typically seek a clear path to realizing returns on their investments, making future fundraising easier. Talent Attraction: Publicly traded companies can offer stock options and other equity incentives, making them more attractive to top talent in a competitive market. The ability to offer publicly traded stock as compensation can be a powerful recruitment tool, helping to build a strong and experienced team. Improved Governance: Public companies typically adopt more robust corporate governance structures to comply with regulatory requirements, which can lead to better decision-making and accountability. This often results in a more disciplined and professionally managed organization. The Audacious Plan: A $1 Billion Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy One of the most compelling aspects of ProCap BTC’s public offering is its previously stated ambition to acquire up to $1 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC). This is not merely a passive investment; it’s a strategic move that underscores the firm’s conviction in Bitcoin’s role as a long-term store of value and a hedge against inflation. Such a substantial acquisition would position ProCap Financial as a significant institutional holder of Bitcoin, alongside major players like MicroStrategy, various Bitcoin spot ETFs, and other corporate treasuries that have added BTC to their balance sheets. This scale of investment reflects a strong bullish outlook on Bitcoin’s future price performance and its increasing acceptance as a legitimate asset class, signaling confidence in its digital gold narrative. The methods for this acquisition could vary, potentially including direct spot purchases from exchanges, over-the-counter (OTC) deals to minimize market impact, or even strategic investments in Bitcoin mining operations. Given the scale, a diversified approach is likely to manage execution risk and price volatility. The firm might also explore options like dollar-cost averaging (DCA) to mitigate volatility risks over time, or structured products to gain exposure without directly holding the underlying asset, though direct holding seems to be the stated intent. OTC desks are often preferred for large institutional buys to prevent significant price slippage that could occur from placing large orders on open exchanges, ensuring a more efficient and less disruptive acquisition process. A $1 billion Bitcoin acquisition by a publicly traded entity like ProCap Financial would send a strong signal to the market. It reinforces the narrative of institutional adoption, demonstrating that sophisticated investors are increasingly comfortable allocating significant capital to digital assets. This influx of capital could provide substantial buying pressure for Bitcoin, potentially influencing its price trajectory and overall market sentiment. It also serves as a validation for other corporations and institutions considering similar moves, further legitimizing Bitcoin as a treasury asset and an integral part of modern investment portfolios. The long-term implications for Bitcoin’s market capitalization and liquidity are substantial. Key Aspects of $1B BTC Acquisition Description Purpose Strategic long-term holding, balance sheet asset, institutional exposure to digital gold. Potential Methods Direct spot purchases, OTC deals, investments in mining infrastructure, structured products. Market Impact Increased institutional demand, potential price support, enhanced legitimacy for BTC, reduced supply on exchanges. Risk Factors Price volatility, evolving regulatory landscape, operational security for large holdings, market liquidity for such large buys. What are the Broader Implications for the Crypto Market and Beyond? ProCap BTC’s move is a microcosm of a larger trend: the increasing convergence of traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). As more crypto-native companies seek public listings and more traditional financial institutions offer crypto products, the lines between these two worlds blur. This integration brings both opportunities and challenges, including the need for robust regulatory frameworks that can accommodate innovation while protecting investors. The success of Bitcoin spot ETFs in the U.S. has already opened the floodgates for institutional capital, and ProCap Financial’s direct public listing takes this integration a step further, providing another regulated pathway for exposure. The SEC’s role is critical here. While they have been cautious with certain crypto products, particularly those deemed securities, their engagement with firms like ProCap BTC seeking public listing through traditional routes indicates a willingness to oversee and regulate legitimate operations. This could pave the way for clearer guidelines and more predictable pathways for other crypto businesses looking to enter mainstream finance. The ongoing dialogue between regulators and industry participants is crucial for fostering an environment where innovation can thrive within a secure and compliant framework. This public offering could serve as a case study for future crypto firms contemplating a similar path, potentially accelerating the mainstream adoption of digital assets. This development could inspire a wave of similar initiatives. We might see more crypto investment firms, blockchain technology companies, and even DeFi protocols exploring traditional public markets as a means to scale and attract broader capital. This maturation of the industry is crucial for its long-term sustainability and widespread adoption. It signifies a shift from the fringes of finance to its core, as digital assets become an undeniable part of global investment portfolios. The ripple effect could lead to greater liquidity, deeper markets, and ultimately, more stability for the entire crypto ecosystem, fostering a more robust and resilient digital economy. Challenges and Opportunities While the prospect of ProCap Financial’s public listing and substantial Bitcoin acquisition is exciting, it’s essential to consider both the potential hurdles and the vast opportunities that lie ahead: Challenges: Regulatory Scrutiny: Navigating complex and evolving SEC regulations, especially concerning crypto assets, remains a dynamic challenge. Market Volatility: The inherent volatility of Bitcoin can impact the company’s balance sheet, profitability, and investor confidence, requiring sophisticated risk management strategies. Competition: A growing number of Bitcoin investment vehicles and public companies in the crypto space means ProCap Financial will operate in a competitive environment. Operational Security: Ensuring the secure custody of a substantial Bitcoin holding is paramount and requires cutting-edge security protocols and practices. Public Perception: Managing public perception and educating traditional investors about the value proposition of digital assets will be ongoing tasks. Opportunities: First-Mover Advantage: Potentially establishing itself as a leading publicly traded Bitcoin investment vehicle, attracting early institutional capital. Institutional Inflow: Attracting significant capital from institutions seeking regulated exposure to Bitcoin without directly managing the complexities of crypto custody. Market Education: Helping to legitimize Bitcoin further in the eyes of mainstream investors and corporations, fostering broader acceptance. Innovation: Using public capital to fund further innovations in crypto financial products, services, and blockchain technology, driving future growth. Diversification: Offering a unique investment opportunity for portfolios looking to diversify into digital assets through a traditional stock market vehicle. Actionable Insights for Investors For investors interested in the crypto space but preferring traditional investment vehicles, ProCap Financial (CCCM) could offer a new avenue for exposure to Bitcoin. Here are some actionable insights: It’s crucial to conduct thorough due diligence on the company’s financial health, management team, and specific investment strategies once more details become publicly available through subsequent SEC filings (e.g., S-1 or F-1 registration statements). Monitor the broader regulatory environment for digital assets, as changes can significantly impact companies operating in this sector. Stay informed about SEC announcements and legislative developments. Consider the company’s long-term vision for its Bitcoin holdings and how it plans to manage volatility and security risks. Understand their approach to custody and risk mitigation. Evaluate the competitive landscape. How does ProCap Financial differentiate itself from existing Bitcoin ETFs or other publicly traded companies with significant Bitcoin holdings? As with any investment, consider your own risk tolerance and investment objectives before allocating capital to a company like ProCap Financial. The journey of ProCap BTC, from a visionary firm led by Anthony Pompliano to a publicly traded entity known as ProCap Financial, marks a significant milestone in the ongoing integration of digital assets into the global financial landscape. The ambitious plan for a $1 billion Bitcoin acquisition, coupled with the rigorous process of an SEC filing and public listing, underscores a growing confidence in Bitcoin’s enduring value and the maturation of the crypto industry. This development is not just a win for ProCap BTC; it’s a powerful testament to the transformative potential of cryptocurrency, paving the way for more institutional adoption and mainstream recognition. As ProCap Financial prepares to list under CCCM, the eyes of both the crypto and traditional financial worlds will be watching closely, anticipating the next chapter in this exciting narrative, and the profound impact it may have on the future of finance.

2025-06-25T11:05:53,"Google’s Quantum Computing Could Threaten Bitcoin Encryption, Warns NYDIG","The post Google’s Quantum Computing Could Threaten Bitcoin Encryption, Warns NYDIG appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Every time quantum computing advances, one question echoes across the crypto world: Is Bitcoin still secure? Google’s latest announcement has reignited that fear. The tech giant revealed a major leap in quantum capabilities, slashing the number of qubits needed to break RSA encryption from 20 million to just 1 million. That’s a massive jump, and it has sparked urgent debate about the future safety of Bitcoin’s cryptographic foundation . Table of contents What’s Happening with Quantum Computing? Understanding the Threat to Bitcoin Why RSA and Bitcoin’s Encryption Could Be at Risk Is Bitcoin Safe Right Now? Can Post-Quantum Cryptography Save Bitcoin? Conclusion: No Immediate Panic, But Urgent Preparation Needed FAQs What’s Happening with Quantum Computing? Quantum computing is no longer theoretical. Using principles like superposition and entanglement, these machines can process data in ways traditional computers can’t. Today’s quantum computers can operate with over 100 qubits, and advancements in error correction are making them increasingly stable and practical. The field is accelerating, and with it comes a looming concern: Can this tech break encryption standards like RSA—and eventually Bitcoin’s? Understanding the Threat to Bitcoin Bitcoin doesn’t use RSA. Instead, it relies on ECDSA and increasingly, Schnorr signatures, for cryptographic security. These offer multiple advantages: Smaller keys with equivalent security Faster processing Multi-signature aggregation for enhanced privacy But here’s the catch: According to a new report by the New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG), these systems are not immune. As quantum computing progresses, even Bitcoin’s current cryptography may become vulnerable. Why RSA and Bitcoin’s Encryption Could Be at Risk RSA encryption is widely used and considered secure because it relies on the difficulty of factoring large numbers. That security was challenged in 1994 when Peter Shor introduced an algorithm capable of cracking RSA, if run on a sufficiently powerful quantum computer. Back then, such a machine didn’t exist. Today, we’re getting closer. With Google’s quantum milestone, that theoretical threat is beginning to look like a real-world problem. Is Bitcoin Safe Right Now? For now, yes. Bitcoin’s current cryptographic protections are strong enough against both classical and existing quantum computers. But the landscape is changing: Quantum hardware is improving rapidly Error correction is advancing Hybrid quantum-classical systems are being developed The clock is ticking. Bitcoin may be safe today—but without upgrades, that may not hold true in the next decade. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : She Thought It Was Love… Then Lost $430K in a Crypto Scam , Can Post-Quantum Cryptography Save Bitcoin? There is ongoing work in the field of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)—algorithms specifically designed to resist quantum attacks. But NYDIG’s report highlights some challenges: Larger keys and signatures Slower transaction speeds Reduced performance across the Bitcoin network This means that integrating PQC into Bitcoin is possible, but not without trade-offs in speed, efficiency, and scalability. Conclusion: No Immediate Panic, But Urgent Preparation Needed Bitcoin is not under threat today, but complacency is not an option. The takeaway from NYDIG and Google’s announcement is clear: the crypto industry must act now to ensure long-term security. Whether that means adopting post-quantum cryptographic standards or developing new protocols, the future of decentralized finance may depend on it. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Google Quantum AI explores quantum computing, which uses quantum mechanics (like superposition) to solve problems classical computers can’t. They aim to build large-scale, error-corrected quantum computers for various applications. Is Bitcoin safe from quantum computers right now? Yes, Bitcoin’s current cryptography (ECDSA, Schnorr signatures) is secure against existing classical and quantum computers. However, rapid advancements mean future vulnerability is possible. How does Google’s quantum computing breakthrough affect Bitcoin’s security? Google’s reduction of qubits needed to break RSA (from 20M to 1M) highlights the accelerating threat.

2025-06-25T11:01:02,"NYSE Breaks New Ground: Trump Media’s Crypto ETF Eyes Listing","NYSE Arca has officially submitted a rule change proposal (SR-NYSEArca-2025-45) to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), seeking approval to list the Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF. The dual-asset fund, introduced last week by Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), seeks to provide direct exposure to both Bitcoin and Ether within a single investment vehicle. Source: NYSE The application, filed via SEC Form 19b-4 , represents the next step following the ETF’s initial prospectus submission, which proposed a 3-to-1 value allocation favoring Bitcoin over Ether. If approved, the ETF would trade under NYSE Arca Rule 8.201-E, which governs commodity-based trust shares. NYSE Seeks Rule Change to List Trump Media’s Bitcoin-Ethereum ETF As outlined in the filing, the fund is sponsored by Yorkville America Digital, LLC, with digital asset custody managed by Foris DAX Trust Company. Notably, pricing transparency will be provided through benchmark rates supplied by CF Benchmarks, a standard provider used in other SEC-approved ETFs. And also, the daily NAV, total holdings, and intraday indicative values will be published, with updates every 15 seconds during market hours. Trump Media filed with the SEC to launch a Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, while the Trump Organization unveiled a $499 U.S.-made smartphone. #trump #etf https://t.co/tFTibnN0lg — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 16, 2025 The fund’s creation and redemption process will occur in-kind, in blocks of 10,000 shares through authorized participants. This model allows the trust to deliver and receive Bitcoin and Ether directly, reducing potential tax implications and improving pricing efficiency. To meet SEC expectations for investor protection, NYSE Arca emphasized its membership in the Intermarket Surveillance Group (ISG) and cited reliance on market data from CME’s Bitcoin and Ether futures markets for pricing accuracy and fraud detection. The exchange also reaffirmed that it can apply existing market safeguards such as trading halts and compliance monitoring. NYSE Arca further emphasized that existing frameworks are sufficient to detect and prevent potential fraud or manipulation in the crypto markets. The proposed rule change must now go through the SEC’s formal review process. Once published in the Federal Register, the agency will open a comment period. The SEC will then decide to approve, reject, or extend the review timeline. If granted, the Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum Trust would be one of the first U.S.-listed ETFs to offer simultaneous exposure to both Bitcoin and Ether. The move follows the SEC’s earlier approval of single-asset Bitcoin or Ethereum ETFs from BlackRock, Fidelity, and others. Trump Media Expands with Crypto ETF Ambitions Trump Media is moving closer to launching its Truth Social Bitcoin ETF, but the fund faces steep competition and trust hurdles in a crowded market. #TruthSocial #BitcoinETF https://t.co/oBIWgcH4CX — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 4, 2025 This is not the only ETF in development. Earlier this month, NYSE Arca also filed to list the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF , which would hold Bitcoin exclusively. Both products are part of Trump Media’s broader push into digital assets. @TrumpMediaTech has unveiled a $400M stock buyback and maintains a $2.3B Bitcoin reserve. #TrumpMedia #Bitcoin https://t.co/oCc9eMHuSo — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 23, 2025 The company has announced plans to repurchase up to $400 million of its own shares and raised $2.32 billion through a private placement to establish a Bitcoin treasury. As of late May, $2.4 billion has been raised, though no acquisitions have yet been disclosed. Trump Media, which owns the Truth Social social platform, streaming service Truth+, and fintech brand Truth.Fi, has proposed additional funds, including the America First Bitcoin Fund and the America First Stablecoin Income Fund.

2025-06-25T11:00:14,"Trump’s Truth Social Officialy Files For Bitcoin And Ethereum ETFs With NYSE","Trump Media and Technology Group Corp (TMTG) has officially filed for its second crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF), focusing on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), as detailed in a recent filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Trump Media Files For Second Crypto ETF If the SEC approves this new investment product, it will trade on NYSE Arca, the electronic division of the New York Stock Exchange known for handling exchange-traded fund transactions. This latest filing comes just eight days after TMTG submitted a prospectus with the Connecticut Attorney General through its Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) partner, Yorkville America. Majority-owned by President Donald Trump, Trump Media is intensifying its efforts to promote financial products linked to blockchain technologies. The company aims to provide the public with regulated investment vehicles that offer exposure to the cryptocurrency market. Related Reading: Is Ethereum Staging A Repeat Of 2021? Here’s Why A 200% Surge Could Follow Recently, Trump Media announced its ambition to raise $2.4 billion, with the goal of becoming one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin. This move appears to be part of a broader strategy to diversify its business and attract a wider array of investors. By launching multiple crypto-focused ETFs, Trump Media hopes to generate significant interest in its stock, potentially positioning itself as an appealing option for cryptocurrency enthusiasts. However, with several crypto ETFs already available in the market, there are questions about how much investor interest these funds will garner. The success of the ETFs will likely hinge on their fee structures and how competitive they are compared to existing options. Bitcoin To Hit $180,000-$250,000 As of now, Bitcoin is trading at $106,000, recovering 3% from a recent drop to $98,000. This volatility is largely attributed to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran, which has intensified over the past 12 days, impacting financial markets significantly. Market analyst known as Mr. Wall Street recently shared his insights on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), reiterating his bullish targets for Bitcoin, which he believes will reach between $180,000 and $250,000 this year despite any external conflict. Interestingly, Mr. Wall Street noted a significant shift in capital flows, with over $20 billion moving from gold to Bitcoin in the last two weeks alone. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Loads Up: $422M In ETH Bought In Under a Month This trend suggests that institutional investors and hedge funds are increasingly viewing Bitcoin as a more reliable store of value compared to gold, given Bitcoin’s fixed supply. Additionally, Mr. Wall Street pointed out that the over-the-counter (OTC) desks are becoming less liquid, indicating that significant upward movement in Bitcoin’s price could be imminent. A key indicator, the hash ribbon, recently flashed, signaling that Bitcoin often experiences a 10% correction before rallying by 50-125%. Mr. Wall Street believes that the recent dip to $98,000 constituted this correction, and he anticipates a substantial return on investment from current levels. Moving forward, the analyst expects “continued noise” from the geopolitical landscape, but he believes that further escalation is unlikely. The recent market dip created a sense of peak fear, which historically precedes significant price breakouts, Mr. Wall Street said.

2025-06-25T10:59:28,"Kaspa Early Adopters Made 50x; Bitcoin Solaris Presale Investors Positioned for 500x Returns","The post Kaspa Early Adopters Made 50x; Bitcoin Solaris Presale Investors Positioned for 500x Returns appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Kaspa created waves when its early believers walked away with 50x gains. It was fast, efficient, and gave retail investors a chance to win big. But now, that window seems to be closing. The hype is cooling. The returns are flattening. And the focus is shifting. Investors are no longer asking, “What coin will do well next cycle?” They’re asking, “What coin will explode with 500x potential before everyone else finds out?” That question has one answer right now: Bitcoin Solaris. Why Bitcoin Solaris Is Catching Fire Bitcoin Solaris, or BTC-S, isn’t just another smart-contract-enabled coin. It is an entire reimagining of what blockchain scalability and mass adoption could look like when combined with the security principles of Bitcoin. Built with a dual-consensus model that merges Proof-of-Work and Delegated Proof-of-Stake across two distinct layers, Bitcoin Solaris delivers security and speed without compromise. But what truly changes the game is accessibility. Through the exciting release of the upcoming Solaris Nova App, users will be able to mine BTC-S using their mobile phones and laptops. This isn’t mining for whales with rigs. This is mining designed for everyone. The average user can now earn Bitcoin Solaris from their device by simply participating. You can even estimate your potential income with this mining calculator . Kaspa Was Impressive. But Solaris Feels Inevitable. Kaspa deserves credit. It brought DAG-based mining to the spotlight, delivered fast blocks, and rewarded its early adopters with real gains. But it’s starting to lose momentum. Without a native mobile mining experience or deep DeFi integrations, Kaspa may fall behind the next generation of high-utility blockchains. Explore the Bitcoin Solaris Ecosystem Now By contrast, Bitcoin Solaris is gaining traction across every crypto community. A detailed review by Crypto Vlog dives into why influencers and analysts alike are calling it the next big thing. With a mobile-first design, blazing speed, and a layered architecture, Bitcoin Solaris is purpose-built for mass adoption. Technical Breakthroughs Driving Hype Behind all the excitement lies serious technology. Bitcoin Solaris delivers unmatched performance thanks to several key innovations: 10,000 Transactions Per Second: Achieved with 2-second finality across testnet. Dual-Layer Structure: A Base Layer secured by Proof-of-Work and a Solaris Layer optimized with Delegated Proof-of-Stake. Validator Rotation: Boosts decentralization by rotating block producers and minimizing central control. Energy Efficiency: Adaptive mining algorithms reduce power consumption without sacrificing speed. Smart Contracts: Built for DeFi and future dApp expansion, fully compatible with the blockchain’s hybrid consensus. These capabilities are now live in development and confirmed in independent audits by Cyberscope and Freshcoins , ensuring trust in the infrastructure. To stay updated on community growth and updates, join the official Telegram and follow Bitcoin Solaris on X . Presale Ignites Investor FOMO Bitcoin Solaris is currently in Phase 9 of its limited presale. Tokens are available at $9 with a bonus of 7 percent. That price is about to jump to $10, and the launch price is set at $20. With less than six weeks left before the presale ends on July 31, 2025, there is a narrow window for investors to lock in gains before BTC-S hits major exchanges. Over 12,300 users have already joined, making it one of the most explosive and shortest presales in recent memory. As momentum builds and investor interest surges, every day of delay could mean leaving profits on the table. You can secure your presale allocation and learn more at the official Bitcoin Solaris site. Referral Program That Rewards Everyone Bitcoin Solaris is not only rewarding investors through its presale, it’s also creating an ecosystem of growth through its Double Rewards Referral Program . Users who invite others receive 5 percent of their purchase in BTC-S, while the referred users also get a 5 percent bonus on their tokens. This dual incentive system fuels organic adoption and puts the power of community back in investors’ hands. The process is seamless and completely integrated within the user dashboard on the main platform, making it easy to grow your holdings while introducing others to the project. What This Means for the Future Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just offering utility. It’s offering opportunity. It combines serious performance with accessible mining, DeFi-ready staking mechanics, and a fair referral system, all under a blockchain architecture designed for the long term. With early-stage momentum mirroring projects like Kaspa and presale excitement ramping up faster than most competitors, this could genuinely be the last moment to buy in before BTC-S enters a different league. Kaspa may have made 50x possible. But Bitcoin Solaris is where some investors now see the path to 500x and beyond.

2025-06-25T10:52:46,"She Thought It Was Love… Then Lost $430K in a Crypto Scam","The post She Thought It Was Love… Then Lost $430K in a Crypto Scam appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Australia’s major crypto crackdown has taken an unexpected turn. On Wednesday, a nationwide law enforcement operation targeting crypto ATMs identified 90 individuals linked to suspected scams—only to discover most were actually victims, not offenders. Despite tightening regulations, Australia continues to battle rising crypto ATM scams. The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), in collaboration with state police and other agencies, launched a sweeping probe into crypto ATM usage across the country. Top Crypto ATM Users Flagged—But Here’s the Twist Authorities analyzed high-volume crypto ATM users across every Australian state, expecting to catch key fraudsters. However, AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas confirmed that “many of the top transactions in each state were involved in illicit activity—but the majority were innocent victims.” In some cases, scammers had manipulated unsuspecting Australians into repeatedly using crypto ATMs to deposit funds—thinking they were making investments or helping someone in need. Heartbreaking Victim Stories Emerge One woman in New South Wales only realized she was scammed when police visited her home weeks after her last transaction. Another woman in her 70s lost over $430,000 in a romance scam. Another senior was conned by a fake investment ad and lost more than $200,000, with no chance of recovery. “Sadly, she’s not the only one,” said Thomas . “These scams are targeting vulnerable people and costing them their life savings.” AUSTRAC and Police Tighten ATM Rules Amid Crypto Crime Wave In response to the surge in crypto-related scams, AUSTRAC has now: Imposed a $5,000 cap on crypto ATM deposits Enforce enhanced customer verification procedures Mandated scam warnings on all crypto ATM screens .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Hack Hits Binance Smart Chain: CertiK Tracks $2M Exploit , The operation was led by the NSW Police, AUSTRAC, and the Australia-New Zealand Crypto Practitioners Working Group (ANZCPWG), with national coordination by the AFP-led Joint Policing and Crime Coordination Centre (JPC3). Despite these measures, Thomas issued a stern warning: “Depositing cash into crypto ATMs is risky. Users should be extremely cautious.” Crypto ATM Crime: A Growing Concern in Australia This investigation highlights how crypto ATM fraud is becoming a major security challenge—even as regulators try to catch up. With scam losses soaring and victims growing in number, Australia’s regulators are calling for increased public awareness and stricter surveillance on crypto transactions. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-25T10:50:41,"Altcoin Season Index at 17: Unlocking Strategies for the Current Bitcoin Season","BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season Index at 17: Unlocking Strategies for the Current Bitcoin Season Are you feeling the shift in the cryptocurrency market? If you’ve been closely watching your altcoin portfolio, you might have noticed a different trend emerging. The Altcoin Season Index , a crucial metric for understanding market dynamics, currently sits at a low 17. This figure, reported by CoinMarketCap (CMC), isn’t just a number; it’s a clear signal that the crypto market is firmly in what’s known as Bitcoin Season . But what exactly does this mean for your cryptocurrency investment decisions, and how can you navigate these shifting tides? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index: What Does 17 Really Mean? The Altcoin Season Index is more than just a casual observation; it’s a data-driven tool designed to provide clarity on market sentiment and performance. Tracked by CoinMarketCap, this index offers a snapshot of how the broader altcoin market is performing relative to Bitcoin over a specific period. Let’s break down its mechanics: The Core Metric: The index specifically compares the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin over the past 90 days. Defining Altcoin Season: For the market to be officially in Altcoin Season , a significant majority—at least 75%—of these top 100 altcoins must have outperformed Bitcoin within that 90-day window. This typically indicates a period of high risk appetite, with capital flowing from Bitcoin into smaller, more volatile assets. Defining Bitcoin Season: Conversely, when 25% or fewer of these altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin, the market is deemed to be in Bitcoin Season . A score of 17, as we see now, falls squarely into this category, signaling a period where Bitcoin is the dominant performer. The Scale: The index scores range from 1 to 100, with higher scores indicating a stronger altcoin performance relative to Bitcoin. A score of 17 is on the lower end, emphasizing Bitcoin’s current strength. This metric is invaluable for investors seeking to understand the prevailing market narrative. It helps in identifying whether the market is favoring the stability and established nature of Bitcoin or the higher-risk, higher-reward potential of altcoins. Navigating Bitcoin Season: Key Strategies for Cryptocurrency Investment When the Altcoin Season Index points to a strong Bitcoin Season , it’s not a time for panic, but rather for strategic adjustments. Understanding this phase is crucial for any serious cryptocurrency investment portfolio. Here are some actionable insights and strategies: Prioritize Bitcoin: The Safe Haven in Volatility? During Bitcoin Season, capital tends to flow into Bitcoin. This could be due to several factors: Risk Aversion: In uncertain macroeconomic conditions or periods of heightened market fear, investors often flock to Bitcoin as a perceived “safer” asset within the crypto space. Its larger market cap and longer track record make it less volatile than many altcoins. Institutional Interest: The emergence of Bitcoin ETFs has opened doors for traditional finance, often leading to significant inflows into BTC, especially during periods when institutional investors are more cautious about broader crypto exposure. Halving Cycles: Historically, the periods leading up to and immediately following Bitcoin halvings often see Bitcoin outperform altcoins as scarcity narratives gain traction. Actionable Insight: Consider increasing your Bitcoin allocation. While altcoins might offer explosive gains during their season, Bitcoin often provides a more stable foundation during its dominance. This doesn’t mean abandoning altcoins entirely, but rather rebalancing your portfolio to reflect the current market reality. Re-evaluating Your Altcoin Portfolio: Quality Over Quantity In a Bitcoin Season , many smaller, less established altcoins tend to bleed against Bitcoin. This is a crucial time to review your altcoin holdings. Focus on Large-Cap Alts: During this phase, larger, more established altcoins with strong fundamentals (e.g., Ethereum, Solana, Binance Coin) tend to fare better than smaller, highly speculative assets. They often have more liquidity and a stronger community, making them more resilient. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): If you believe in the long-term potential of certain altcoins, Bitcoin Season can present an excellent opportunity to accumulate them at lower prices relative to Bitcoin. DCA helps mitigate risk by spreading your purchases over time. Research and Due Diligence: This period is ideal for deep diving into the projects you hold or are considering. Look for strong development teams, clear roadmaps, active communities, and real-world utility. Projects lacking these fundamentals are more likely to suffer significant drawdowns. Challenge: It can be tempting to chase pumps in smaller altcoins, but during Bitcoin Season, these pumps are often short-lived and carry higher risk. Patience and discipline are key. Historical Context: The Ebbs and Flows of the Crypto Market The crypto market is cyclical, and the concept of Altcoin Season and Bitcoin Season is not new. Understanding past cycles can provide valuable perspective. Historically, Bitcoin often leads bull runs, breaking new all-time highs and attracting fresh capital into the market. Once Bitcoin’s momentum slows or it consolidates at higher levels, a portion of that capital tends to “rotate” into altcoins, triggering an Altcoin Season. This rotation happens as investors seek higher returns in riskier assets, or as new narratives and technological advancements in altcoin projects gain traction. Example: In late 2017, after Bitcoin’s meteoric rise, there was a significant Altcoin Season in early 2018. Similarly, after Bitcoin’s surge in late 2020/early 2021, many altcoins saw parabolic gains in the spring of 2021. However, these rotations are not guaranteed, and the duration of each season can vary wildly. Macroeconomic factors, regulatory developments, and major technological breakthroughs can all influence these cycles. Why the Current Bitcoin Dominance? Factors at Play The current score of 17 on the Altcoin Season Index isn’t arbitrary. Several factors are likely contributing to Bitcoin’s current dominance in the crypto market : Macroeconomic Headwinds: Global economic uncertainty, inflation concerns, and interest rate hikes can lead investors to de-risk, moving away from speculative assets like altcoins and towards more established ones like Bitcoin, or even out of crypto entirely. Spot Bitcoin ETF Success: The approval and subsequent success of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the US have brought unprecedented institutional capital into Bitcoin. This steady demand creates a strong floor and upward pressure on BTC’s price, often overshadowing altcoin performance. Pre-Halving Accumulation: While the halving has passed, the anticipation and the post-halving supply shock narrative continue to make Bitcoin an attractive asset for long-term holders. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased regulatory scrutiny on altcoins, particularly those deemed unregistered securities, can deter investors and shift focus back to Bitcoin, which is more widely accepted as a commodity. Lack of Strong Altcoin Narratives: While there are always innovative projects, there hasn’t been a single, overarching altcoin narrative (like DeFi Summer or NFTs in previous cycles) powerful enough to consistently pull capital away from Bitcoin in recent months. Understanding these underlying drivers helps in making informed cryptocurrency investment decisions rather than reacting emotionally to market fluctuations. Is Another Altcoin Season Inevitable? What to Watch For While we are currently in Bitcoin Season , the dynamic nature of the crypto market suggests that an Altcoin Season will eventually return. The question is when, and what signals should investors look for? Bitcoin Dominance Chart: Keep a close eye on Bitcoin’s dominance chart. A significant and sustained drop in BTC dominance often precedes or accompanies an Altcoin Season. New Capital Inflows: When fresh capital enters the crypto market, it often flows into Bitcoin first. Once Bitcoin has absorbed a good portion of this, some of it then trickles down into altcoins. Emergence of Strong Narratives: The next Altcoin Season might be fueled by new, compelling narratives – perhaps advancements in AI, DePIN, gaming, or real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Projects leading these innovations could attract significant attention and capital. Ethereum’s Performance: Ethereum often acts as a bellwether for the altcoin market. If Ethereum starts to significantly outperform Bitcoin, it could signal broader altcoin strength. Market Sentiment Shift: A sustained shift from “fear” to “greed” on sentiment indices can indicate a growing appetite for riskier assets. Opportunity: Preparing for the next Altcoin Season during Bitcoin Season involves identifying high-potential projects at relatively lower valuations, building positions, and patiently waiting for the market to rotate. Challenges and Opportunities in a Bitcoin-Dominated Market Every market phase presents its own set of challenges and opportunities. A strong Bitcoin Season is no different for cryptocurrency investment . Challenges: Underperformance of Altcoins: Your altcoin portfolio might experience significant drawdowns against Bitcoin, leading to frustration and potential losses if not managed carefully. FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) on Bitcoin: While you might be holding altcoins, seeing Bitcoin surge can create FOMO, leading to impulsive decisions. Increased Volatility for Smaller Alts: Less liquid altcoins can experience extreme volatility, making them risky short-term plays. Opportunities: Accumulation Phase for Alts: Bitcoin Season offers a chance to accumulate quality altcoins at potentially discounted prices relative to Bitcoin. Stronger Foundation: If Bitcoin continues its upward trend, it strengthens the entire crypto ecosystem, laying a healthier foundation for the next altcoin rally. Learning and Research: This period is excellent for in-depth research, understanding project fundamentals, and refining your investment thesis without the pressure of rapidly moving markets. Ultimately, a successful cryptocurrency investment strategy during Bitcoin Season requires patience, a long-term perspective, and a disciplined approach to portfolio management. Beyond the Index: Complementary Metrics for the Savvy Investor While the Altcoin Season Index is a valuable tool, it’s just one piece of the puzzle. Savvy investors should also consider other metrics to get a holistic view of the crypto market : Bitcoin Dominance Chart (BTC.D): This chart directly shows Bitcoin’s market capitalization as a percentage of the total crypto market cap. A rising BTC.D often indicates Bitcoin Season, while a falling BTC.D can signal Altcoin Season. Total Crypto Market Cap (TOTAL): Observing the overall market cap helps understand the flow of new money into the space. When TOTAL rises significantly, it often benefits both BTC and alts. Total Altcoin Market Cap (TOTAL2): This chart specifically tracks the market cap of all cryptocurrencies excluding Bitcoin. A surge here indicates altcoin strength. Crypto Fear & Greed Index: This index gauges overall market sentiment. During periods of extreme greed, altcoins tend to perform well, while fear often leads to capital flowing into Bitcoin or out of the market entirely. On-Chain Data: Analyzing on-chain metrics like exchange flows, stablecoin supply, and whale movements can provide deeper insights into market participants’ intentions. Combining the insights from the Altcoin Season Index with these complementary metrics can help you make more informed and strategic cryptocurrency investment decisions. The Altcoin Season Index at 17 is a clear indicator: we are currently in Bitcoin Season . This isn’t a time for despair for altcoin holders, but rather a crucial period for strategic planning and smart cryptocurrency investment . By understanding the mechanics of the index, analyzing historical trends, and adapting your portfolio, you can not only weather this phase but also position yourself for future growth. Focus on strengthening your Bitcoin position, conducting thorough research on promising altcoins, and exercising patience. The crypto market is dynamic, and while Bitcoin leads the charge now, the vibrant world of altcoins will undoubtedly have its moment again.

According to CoinDesk's AI research, whales purchased 10.4 trillion SHIB tokens, worth over $110 million, on Monday, marking the largest daily accumulation in five months. The whale action has likely contributed to the cryptocurrency's 17% price bounce from the 16-month low reached Sunday. Note that the broader crypto market has stabilized following the initial knee-jerk reaction to the tensions in the Middle East. BTC, which fell below $100K over the weekend, last changed hands near $106,000. Market data indicate that SHIB is maintaining a generally constructive posture, with higher lows forming a subtle uptrend channel. The token found significant volume support at the $0.00001158 level during the 24 hours from June 24, 09:00 to June 25, 08:00, with trading volume surging to 439 billion, well above the daily average. This accumulation at support levels suggests the potential for continued upside momentum if the $0.00001175 resistance can be decisively cleared. As of writing, SHIB traded at around $0.00001162 on major exchanges, according to CoinDesk data. Key AI insights Higher lows formed a subtle uptrend channel, suggesting accumulation at support levels and potential for continued upside momentum if $0.00001175 resistance is cleared. During the 60 minutes from 25 June 07:06 to 08:05, SHIB climbed from $0.00001169 to $0.00001171, representing a 0.2% gain. A significant price surge occurred between 07:25-07:27, with volume peaking at 12.36 billion SHIB as prices reached the session high of $0.00001175. Price action formed an ascending channel with higher lows, though a sharp correction at 08:03 tested the $0.00001171 support level, suggesting consolidation after the earlier rally. Hourly chart SHIB's recovery has stalled since Tuesday, with prices trading in what appears to be a descending triangle, characterized by a falling trendline and a horizontal support line. A price move through the descending trendline would signal a continuation of the recovery rally, exposing the June 16 resistance above $0.00001230. Conversely, a breakdown of the triangle would signal a bearish reversal lower.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/25/shiba-inu-whales-snap-up-10t-shib-prices-chalk-out-descending-triangle-pattern,"BTC|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|RESEARCH","Markets|SHIB|Technical Analysis|Markets|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-25T10:40:15,"This 2014 Email Confirms Ripple Is Older Than Bitcoin","A 2014 email exchange has resurfaced online, confirming a fact long known by early blockchain enthusiasts but often overlooked in broader public discourse: Ripple predates Bitcoin. Brought back into the spotlight by X user SMQKE, this email thread features notable contributors discussing the origins and purpose of Ripple, offering rare clarity about one of the oldest digital payment systems in the crypto space. Ripple’s Early Origins: 2004 and Ryan Fugger’s Vision The email confirms that the earliest version of Ripple was conceived in 2004 by Canadian developer Ryan Fugger. As stated in the thread by Bailey Reutzel, “The first iteration of Ripple was conceived by Ryan Fugger in 2004.” Fugger initially envisioned RipplePay as a decentralized system for individuals to issue and exchange credit based on trust, well before the emergence of blockchain as a concept. This early version of Ripple was not designed as a cryptocurrency, but rather as a peer-to-peer financial system focused on community-based value exchange. It wasn’t until years later, with the rise of Bitcoin, that Ripple shifted focus toward building blockchain-native infrastructure. 2014 E-mails confirm: “Ripple is older than Bitcoin.” pic.twitter.com/9c8cOF4065 — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) June 24, 2025 Ripple vs. Bitcoin: Setting the Timeline Straight The email strongly counters the notion that Ripple was designed solely to profit from Bitcoin’s success. Jeffrey Cliff, responding to an earlier message, asserted: “Ripple predates Bitcoin, and the hype that followed.” This refutes the notion that Ripple was created in response to Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s whitepaper, authored by Satoshi Nakamoto, was published in late 2008, with the genesis block mined in January 2009. In contrast, Ripple’s development had already begun five years earlier under Fugger’s guidance. This timeline confirms Ripple’s independent conceptual genesis, making it one of the oldest projects in the digital currency space. Chris Larsen and the Transformation of Ripple The emails also delve into how Ripple evolved from Fugger’s initial concept into its current state. As Bailey Reutzel explains, Chris Larsen, described as a “serial financial services disruptor”, saw potential in the Ripple idea and sought to develop it further. Under his leadership, Ripple was reshaped to appeal to the financial mainstream, particularly as interest in Bitcoin grew. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Reutzel notes that Larsen likely positioned Ripple as a cryptocurrency not because of its core design, but as a means to attract attention during the early crypto boom. She writes: “Larsen pushed this as a cryptocurrency to catch attention, because the platform itself is not really about cryptocurrency at all.” XRP vs. Ripple: Understanding the Distinction Another important clarification comes from a participant named Evan, who emphasizes the need to differentiate between Ripple and XRP. He writes, “The distinction between Ripple the network and Ripple the currency is often quite confusing, so I think it’s most helpful to call the network Ripple and the currency just XRP .” This separation remains relevant today, particularly in regulatory discussions and in understanding the XRP Ledger’s open-source nature. This email exchange offers rare historical insight into Ripple’s legacy. It confirms that Ripple is not a Bitcoin derivative, but an independent financial innovation that predates the world’s first cryptocurrency by several years. As crypto continues to evolve, understanding the foundational histories of these platforms is more important than ever, especially when clarity is often lost in hype and misinformation.

On June 25, blockchain data flagged by Arkham Intelligence revealed that BlackRock and Fidelity collectively acquired more than $521 million worth of BTC in a single day. According to the transfer logs, BlackRock’s IBIT ETF address received 4,130 BTC, valued at approximately $436.3 million at the time of transfer, with the purchase coming from Coinbase Prime’s institutional custody, signaling a high-confidence allocation into BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF structure.

Both were executed within hours of each other, pointing to methodical layering of exposure. Institutions load up on Bitcoin Also active was Grayscale, which added 55.1 BTC ($5.8 million) to its GBTC trust, despite its gradual outflow trend over recent months. While smaller in scale, it still adds to the week’s net-positive ETF activity. Bitwise and ARK Invest also recorded sizable movements, with Bitwise shuffling 141.4 BTC between its own addresses and ARK moving nearly 40 BTC internally, routine ETF wallet rebalancing but notable in context. The renewed inflows from top-tier asset managers are especially telling given Bitcoin’s consolidation above $105,000, and increasing expectations around ETF-driven Q3 demand. While retail sentiment has cooled somewhat, institutional positioning suggests that the larger players are preparing for a potential leg higher.

HB2324 avoids prior vetoes by limiting crypto reserves to criminal forfeiture assets. If signed into law, the bill would mark Arizona’s second major crypto reserve legislation. Arizona has enacted HB 2324, a bill that creates a Bitcoin and Digital Assets Reserve Fund, consisting solely of seized cryptocurrencies obtained through criminal asset forfeiture proceedings. The bill passed the House of Representatives on a 34-22 vote on June 24, 2025, following Senate passage on a 16-14 vote on June 19, and is awaiting signature by Governor Katie Hobbs to take effect. The law avoids straight investment by taxpayers using only funds won from criminal cases instead of state money or treasury funds.

2025-06-25T10:29:43,"US Bitcoin ETFs record 11 consecutive days of net inflows despite macro jitters","U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds neared a two-week inflow streak on Tuesday, as geopolitical tensions eased and institutional interest continued to drive demand. According to data from SoSoValue, the 12 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs drew a combined $588.55 million in inflows on June 24. This marked the strongest single-day performance in over a month and extended the current streak of consecutive inflows to 11 days, totaling more than $3.3 billion. BlackRock’s IBIT led the day with $436.32 million in inflows, accounting for nearly three-quarters of the total. Fidelity’s FBTC and ARK Invest’s ARKB followed with $85.16 million and $43.85 million, respectively. Bitwise’s BITB, Grayscale’s GBTC, and VanEck’s HODL collectively brought in $23.22 million. Notably, several smaller funds recorded no inflows on the day. The spike in inflows coincided with a shift in macro sentiment, driven largely by geopolitical developments. On June 24, U.S. President Donald Trump announced that Iran and Israel had agreed to a ceasefire, emphasizing that both parties must strictly adhere to the terms. The ceasefire, following nearly two weeks of escalating hostilities, alleviated fears of broader conflict and its potential economic fallout, particularly rising oil prices and inflationary pressure. Bitcoin ( BTC ) responded positively to the news, surging 6.1% to reclaim the $106,718 level at press time. The move above the psychologically important $105,000 level appeared to validate bullish momentum, with market participants interpreting the ceasefire as a temporary de-risking event. Meanwhile, recent regulatory developments have also helped lift market sentiment. On June 23, the Federal Reserve removed the term “reputational risk” from its bank supervision guidelines. The change is seen as a structural shift that may reduce barriers preventing banks from offering services to digital asset firms. Industry experts believe this adjustment could accelerate the integration of crypto within traditional financial systems, particularly in banking infrastructure. You might also like: Trump Media files 19b-4 to list Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF on NYSE Arca Institutional appetite for Bitcoin also appears to be accelerating. MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor recently added $26 m i llion worth of Bitcoin to its treasury, pushing its total holdings to 592,345 Bitcoin. This trend is being mirrored by a growing number of new and established public firms exploring similar treasury strategies. For instance, veteran investor Anthony Pompliano recently unveiled ProCap, a new Bitcoin treasury firm that aims to accumulate $1 billion worth of Bitcoin. ProCap has already acquired 3,724 Bitcoin for roughly $387 million. Further reinforcing this institutional pivot, Trump Media filed with the SEC to list the “Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF” on the New York Stock Exchange. The proposed ETF would allocate 75% of its assets to Bitcoin and 25% to Ethereum, marking a high-profile attempt to gain a foothold in the growing digital asset fund landscape. Commenting on market dynamics, Komodo Platform CTO Kadan Stadelmann told crypto.news that despite macro jitters, “buyers are taking advantage of dips and accumulating.” “Market volume suggests significant market activity. Demand will almost certainly remain strong, especially as companies continue to announce they are starting Bitcoin Treasuries, the latest of which is Donald Trump’s Truth Social,” Stadlemann said. According to a new report by Bybit on portfolio allocation trends, Bitcoin now makes up 30.95% of the average investor’s portfolio, up from 25.4% in November 2024, a sign that investors increasingly view the benchmark cryptocurrency as a mature asset rather than a purely speculative play.

2025-06-25T10:23:19,"How to Trade Bitcoin and Make Profit: Smart Strategies for Investors","BitcoinWorld How to Trade Bitcoin and Make Profit: Smart Strategies for Investors Bitcoin continues to offer outstanding profit opportunities—if approached strategically. Investing in Bitcoin isn’t gambling; it requires understanding, planning, and discipline. Here’s how you can trade Bitcoin effectively and make consistent profit. Understand Bitcoin Before You Trade Bitcoin isn’t like stocks or bonds. It doesn’t produce dividends, nor is it tied to company earnings. Its value comes from network adoption, scarcity (only 21 million coins exist), macroeconomic factors, and investor sentiment. This makes Bitcoin volatile yet potentially lucrative. Key takeaway: Treat Bitcoin as a serious investment, not a quick gamble. Choose the Right Crypto Trading Platform Picking the right crypto trading platform is crucial. Don’t just select the most popular or flashiest app. Instead, align your choice with your investment goals and trading style. For active trading: Select a platform offering low spreads, fast execution, and real-time charts. For long-term holding: Prioritize platforms with robust security measures, cold storage, and transparent fee structures. Always opt for platforms with clear regulations and transparent fees. Ensure the platform offers tools like stop-loss orders, trade automation, and technical analysis indicators. Tip: Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) every time for added security. How to Trade Bitcoin and Make Profit Making profits consistently requires discipline. Trade within your financial comfort zone. Use limit orders to manage entries and exits precisely. Combine technical indicators like RSI, MACD, and moving averages with volume analysis for clearer signals. Always adhere to strict risk management. Limit losses per trade to a maximum of 2% of your total capital. Use stop-loss orders consistently. Avoid chasing sudden market surges (green candles). Remember: The goal isn’t winning every trade; it’s consistently making more when right and losing less when wrong. Time in the Market Beats Timing the Market Trying to consistently time Bitcoin’s peaks and troughs is challenging. A proven method is dollar-cost averaging (DCA): invest a fixed amount regularly, smoothing out volatility and reducing emotional trading decisions. Data supports DCA effectiveness—consistent, smaller investments regularly outperform sporadic large investments driven by market hype. Ensure your Bitcoin holdings are securely stored in a wallet you control—not just on an exchange. This practice helps reinforce a disciplined, long-term investment mindset. Common Mistakes That Can Destroy Your Profits Avoid these common pitfalls to protect your Bitcoin profits. Overtrading: Frequent trades enrich brokers, not you. Using excessive leverage: High leverage can amplify losses and wipe out your position quickly. Blindly following influencers: Trust your strategy, not social media hype. Not securing profits: Have clear targets for profit-taking instead of chasing unrealistic highs. Review your trades regularly, learn from your successes and failures, and continuously refine your trading strategy. Final Thoughts: Invest Strategically, Not Emotionally Bitcoin trading can be highly profitable when approached thoughtfully. Use a reliable crypto trading platform, understand your asset, manage risks diligently, and remain patient and disciplined. Remember: Profitable Bitcoin trading isn’t luck—it’s systematic, strategic, and disciplined investing.

2025-06-25T10:22:28,"Arizona passes HB2324 to create Bitcoin reserve funded by seized crypto, pending governor’s signature","Arizona has passed HB2324, approving a previously rejected proposal to create a Bitcoin reserve funded by seized criminal assets. Arizona has passed HB2324 , a Bitcoin Reserve bill that establishes a state-managed fund for digital assets seized through criminal forfeiture. The bill updates Arizona’s forfeiture laws to formally include cryptocurrencies and sets rules for law enforcement to securely seize and store them using approved digital wallets. The first $300,000 of seized assets goes to the Attorney General’s office. The rest is split — 50% to the Attorney General, 25% to the state’s general fund, and 25% to the reserve fund. HB2324 was initially rejected by the House on May 7. However, after a narrow 16–14 Senate vote on June 19, Republican Senator Janae Shamp — who had previously voted against it — filed a motion to reconsider. Following that, the bill returned to the Arizona House of Representatives and passed, clearing the way for it to be sent to Governor Katie Hobbs for signature. You might also like: Arizona reconsiders Bitcoin reserve plan using forfeited digital assets If the Governor signs it, HB2324 will become the second Bitcoin reserve-related bill enacted in Arizona.

That law allows Arizona to take possession of abandoned cryptocurrencies after three years and manage them through the Department of Revenue, but it does not involve criminal forfeiture or law enforcement seizures. In contrast, two earlier attempts to establish a Bitcoin reserve — SB1373 and SB1025 — were both vetoed by Governor Hobbs.

2025-06-25T10:20:56,"Crypto Fear & Greed: Index Soars to 66, What Does it Mean for Your Portfolio?","BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear & Greed: Index Soars to 66, What Does it Mean for Your Portfolio? Have you ever wondered if the collective mood of cryptocurrency investors could be distilled into a single number? It can, and it’s called the Crypto Fear & Greed Index . This fascinating tool provides a snapshot of the prevailing emotions driving the digital asset space, offering insights that can be invaluable for traders and investors alike. As of June 25, the index proudly stands at 66, firmly nestled in the ‘Greed’ zone – a significant one-point rise from the previous day. But what exactly does this mean for the volatile world of crypto, and how should you interpret this signal? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: What Does 66 Signify? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , developed by Alternative.me, is more than just a number; it’s a barometer of the overall market sentiment . Ranging from 0 to 100, where 0 represents ‘Extreme Fear’ and 100 signifies ‘Extreme Greed,’ the index provides a quick visual cue of the market’s emotional state. A reading of 66, as we see now, indicates a strong leaning towards ‘Greed.’ This suggests that investors are feeling optimistic, perhaps even euphoric, about future price movements, leading to increased buying activity and a general sense of confidence. But how is this magical number calculated? The index isn’t just pulling figures out of thin air. It aggregates data from six crucial factors, each weighted to reflect its importance in gauging market mood: Volatility (25%): This measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average over the last 30 and 90 days. High volatility, especially upwards, can signal a greedy market. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This factor analyzes the current volume and market momentum of Bitcoin and compares it with average values. High buying volumes in a strong market suggest a greedy sentiment. Social Media (15%): The index scans various social media platforms, particularly Twitter, for specific crypto-related hashtags and analyzes the speed and volume of posts. A high number of posts, especially those with positive sentiment, contributes to a higher ‘Greed’ score. Surveys (15%): Historically, Alternative.me conducted weekly polls to gather investor sentiment directly. While currently paused, this component aimed to provide direct insights into the emotional state of participants. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): This metric looks at Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market capitalization. A rising Bitcoin dominance often indicates a flight to safety or a strong belief in Bitcoin’s leadership, which can be interpreted differently depending on the overall market cycle. Google Trends (10%): By analyzing Google search queries related to cryptocurrencies, the index can gauge public interest and search behavior. A surge in searches for terms like ‘Bitcoin price manipulation’ might indicate fear, while ‘Bitcoin buy’ could suggest greed. Understanding these components helps us appreciate the complexity behind a seemingly simple number. A score of 66 is a composite of these varied signals, painting a picture of prevailing optimism. Navigating Market Sentiment: How Does it Influence Your Decisions? The collective market sentiment is a powerful force in the cryptocurrency world. Unlike traditional markets, crypto is highly susceptible to emotional swings, often leading to rapid and dramatic price movements. When sentiment is positive, as indicated by a high Fear & Greed Index, more people are likely to buy, pushing prices higher. This can create a self-fulfilling prophecy, where rising prices further fuel optimism, leading to even more buying – a classic ‘fear of missing out’ (FOMO) scenario. Conversely, when fear grips the market, investors tend to panic sell, driving prices down. This can trigger a cascade effect, as falling prices incite more fear, leading to further selling – a ‘fear, uncertainty, and doubt’ (FUD) cycle. For investors, recognizing these emotional tides is crucial. The index serves as a counter-indicator for many experienced traders: when the index is in ‘Extreme Greed,’ it might be a signal to consider taking profits, as the market could be overheated. When it’s in ‘Extreme Fear,’ it could present a buying opportunity, as assets might be undervalued due to irrational panic selling. Consider the historical context: Extreme Fear (0-24): Often coincides with market bottoms or significant corrections, when many investors are capitulating. Fear (25-49): A period of uncertainty and apprehension, where prices might consolidate or experience minor pullbacks. Neutral (50-54): A balanced market, where neither fear nor greed dominates. Greed (55-74): A period of growing optimism and buying pressure, leading to upward price momentum. Extreme Greed (75-100): Frequently seen during parabolic rallies or market tops, when euphoria is at its peak, and a correction might be imminent. The current reading of 66 places us firmly in the ‘Greed’ phase, suggesting that while optimism is high, it hasn’t yet reached the euphoric ‘Extreme Greed’ levels that often precede major pullbacks. This nuanced understanding is vital for informed decision-making. The Impact of Bitcoin Dominance on Overall Crypto Market Mood Bitcoin dominance is a fascinating component of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, representing Bitcoin’s market capitalization as a percentage of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. Why is this important? Because Bitcoin often acts as the bellwether for the entire crypto market . When Bitcoin’s dominance rises, it can mean a few things: Flight to Safety: During times of uncertainty or market downturns, investors often sell their altcoins and move funds back into Bitcoin, perceiving it as a more stable and established asset. This increases Bitcoin’s dominance. Bitcoin-Led Bull Run: In the early stages of a bull market, Bitcoin often leads the charge, outperforming altcoins. As Bitcoin gains momentum, its dominance increases, pulling the rest of the market up with it. Altcoin Season Ending/Beginning: Conversely, when Bitcoin dominance falls, it often signals an ‘altcoin season,’ where alternative cryptocurrencies see significant gains. The index factors in Bitcoin dominance because a strong, rising dominance can contribute to overall market confidence, especially if it’s accompanied by rising Bitcoin prices. It suggests that the foundation of the crypto market is strong, instilling a sense of ‘Greed’ as investors anticipate further gains across the board. However, a rapidly rising Bitcoin dominance in a fearful market could also indicate a lack of confidence in altcoins, so the context is always key. Mastering Crypto Market Trading Psychology: Beyond the Index While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a valuable tool, true mastery of the crypto market requires a deep understanding of trading psychology . Human emotions are powerful drivers, and in the high-stakes, 24/7 world of crypto, they can easily lead investors astray. The index helps visualize these emotions, but it’s up to individual traders to manage their own responses. Common psychological pitfalls include: FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): This often occurs during periods of ‘Greed’ or ‘Extreme Greed,’ where investors jump into assets that have already seen significant price increases, fearing they will miss out on further gains. This can lead to buying at market tops. FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt): The opposite of FOMO, FUD leads to panic selling during downturns, often at market bottoms, due to overwhelming negative news or price drops. Confirmation Bias: Seeking out information that confirms one’s existing beliefs, ignoring contradictory evidence. Loss Aversion: The tendency to feel the pain of losses more strongly than the pleasure of equivalent gains, leading to holding onto losing positions for too long. To counteract these biases, developing a disciplined approach is paramount. This involves setting clear trading strategies, defining entry and exit points, and sticking to them regardless of emotional swings. The index can be a helpful guide, signaling when the crowd might be acting irrationally, allowing you to take a contrarian view if your strategy dictates. Actionable Insights for Your Crypto Portfolio: What to Do in a Greed Market? So, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is at 66, signaling ‘Greed.’ What does this mean for your portfolio, and what actionable steps can you consider? While no financial advice is guaranteed, here are some insights based on historical market behavior: 1. Re-evaluate Your Risk Exposure In a ‘Greed’ phase, assets tend to be highly valued. This might be a good time to review your portfolio’s risk exposure. Are you over-allocated to highly speculative assets? Consider rebalancing your portfolio to lock in some profits and reduce potential downside if the market sentiment shifts rapidly. 2. Consider Partial Profit-Taking Many seasoned investors use periods of ‘Greed’ to take partial profits. This doesn’t mean selling everything, but perhaps selling a small percentage (e.g., 10-20%) of your most profitable holdings. This strategy allows you to secure gains, reduce your initial investment, and have capital ready for potential future dips. It’s a disciplined way to manage your trading psychology . 3. Avoid FOMO Buys When the market is soaring, the temptation to buy into assets that have already pumped is strong. Resist the urge to chase green candles. Instead, focus on your long-term strategy. If you must enter, consider dollar-cost averaging (DCA) into positions, buying smaller amounts over time, rather than a large lump sum at potentially inflated prices. 4. Research Diligently Even in a bull market, not all projects will succeed. Use periods of ‘Greed’ to double down on your research. Focus on projects with strong fundamentals, clear use cases, active development, and robust communities. Don’t let the rising tide lift all boats in your portfolio without proper due diligence. 5. Set Stop-Loss Orders Protect your capital. In a volatile crypto market , prices can turn on a dime. Setting stop-loss orders for your positions can help limit potential losses if the market suddenly reverses course. This is a crucial risk management tool, especially when sentiment is high and a correction could be around the corner. 6. Stay Informed but Skeptical Keep an eye on news and social media, but maintain a healthy dose of skepticism. During periods of ‘Greed,’ hype and misinformation can be rampant. Focus on reputable sources and objective data points, rather than succumbing to speculative chatter. Monitor the Bitcoin dominance for any significant shifts that might signal a change in market dynamics. The Fear & Greed Index is a valuable guide, but it’s just one piece of the puzzle. Combining its insights with sound financial principles, risk management, and a disciplined approach to trading psychology will empower you to navigate the exciting, yet challenging, world of cryptocurrencies more effectively. Conclusion: Riding the Waves of Crypto Sentiment The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , currently sitting at a ‘Greed’ level of 66, offers a compelling snapshot of the prevailing optimism in the digital asset market. It’s a powerful reminder that human emotions, from fear to elation, play a significant role in shaping price action. By understanding the components of this index – including volatility, market momentum, social media buzz, and crucial Bitcoin dominance – investors can gain a deeper appreciation for the forces at play in the dynamic crypto market . While the ‘Greed’ zone can be exhilarating, it also calls for prudence. It’s a time to reflect on your trading psychology , resist the urge of FOMO, and consider strategies like partial profit-taking and rebalancing your portfolio. Ultimately, the index is a tool to help you make more informed decisions, not a crystal ball. By combining its insights with diligent research and a disciplined approach, you can better position yourself to capitalize on opportunities while mitigating risks in this ever-evolving landscape.

2025-06-25T10:17:42,"Bitcoin Price Live, Traders Eye $97K Dip as Key Entry Point","The post Bitcoin Price Live, Traders Eye $97K Dip as Key Entry Point appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Following Bitcoin’s drop below the $100,000 mark over the weekend, fresh narratives are surfacing about where the top crypto might be headed next. Despite more than $63 billion flowing into the crypto market in 2024, Bitcoin has only managed a modest 13% gain year-to-date, raising questions about what’s holding back the top cryptocurrency. According to 10x Research , the usual catalysts such as ETF inflows, stablecoin activity, and corporate accumulation are in play, yet Bitcoin is no longer reacting the way it did during last year’s rally. Unlike the booming reaction in 2024, Bitcoin is now behaving differently, suggesting something deeper is shifting. Bitcoin Price Prediction Today Level Price Type Description Resistance $110,000 Bullish Target Next key upside level if $97K support holds; seen as a potential rebound zone. Resistance $106,000 Recovery Level BTC has bounced to this level after the weekend dip; signals renewed interest. Neutral $100,000 – $106,000 Consolidation Zone BTC may range between these levels until CPI or macro catalysts emerge. Support $100,000 Psychological Support Former key level now acting as minor support after the recent drop. Support $97,000 Key Entry Point Closely watched as a final dip zone; considered a solid re-entry point. Traders Are Shifting Tactics Instead of sparking a big rally, 10x Research says traders are showing their bullishness in quieter ways. They’re adapting to lower market volatility and putting their money into fewer top coins. This shift in strategy might be slowing down Bitcoin’s short-term gains, even though there’s still plenty of money flowing into the market. Why the Disconnect? The report also revisits the Fed’s surprise 50 bps rate cut in September 2024, which was met with skepticism. Bond yields surged, indicating investors weren’t convinced it was the right move. Meanwhile, inflation, which dropped from 3.5% in April 2024 to a stable 2.4%, has remained steady for three straight months. However, the expert’s warnings that tariffs would reignite inflation have so far proven inaccurate. Meanwhile, unemployment has held steady at 4.2% for nearly a year, defying recession fears. With macro fundamentals stabilizing and the Fed’s tone becoming more dovish, many expected a stronger Bitcoin rally. Yet, the market seems to be waiting for clearer signals. All Eyes on July CPI and Bitcoin’s Next Move With inflation steady and liquidity still flowing, all eyes are now on the July 15 CPI report as the next big market catalyst. 10x Research hints that Bitcoin’s next move may depend less on money flowing in and more on how market participants continue to adapt to these changing geopolitical and financial scenarios. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Supply Shock Ahead? Max Keiser Predicts Major Price Surge , Looking at the current sentiment, Analyst Astronomer suggests the decline may not be over yet, with a possible final dip before the price bounces back. The $97,000 zone is being watched closely as a key level for buyers to re-enter the market. If support holds, Bitcoin could aim for a rebound toward $110,000 . Weekend lows tend to be retested, and with sentiment shifting following a ceasefire deal between Israel and Iran, Bitcoin has already climbed back to $106,000. This geopolitical development, along with improving market mood, has brought renewed buying interest. The overall outlook remains cautiously bullish, with investors eyeing $97,000 as a solid entry point if another dip happens. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-25T10:15:07,"Bitcoin at $101K, Arbitrum Down 88% | Why Qubetics Is the Best Cheap Crypto to Buy Now","While Bitcoin remains the king of crypto, emerging projects like Qubetics and Arbitrum are carving out their own niches, promising unique solutions that could disrupt the industry. Bitcoin, still in its dominant position, has faced price fluctuations recently, with a slight downturn. Arbitrum, on the other hand, is showcasing the power of layer-2 solutions with its current low price. But what makes Qubetics stand out in this crowded space, and why should it be on the watchlist of any crypto enthusiast? As of now, Bitcoin (BTC) is experiencing a modest dip, down 1.26% over the last 24 hours. At a market cap of $2.01 trillion, Bitcoin’s dominance remains undeniable, but it has shown some volatility recently. On the other hand, Arbitrum (ARB), at a market cap of $1.33 billion, is another key player in the Ethereum ecosystem, providing scalability and faster transaction speeds through its layer-2 solution. But it’s the Qubetics presale that’s drawing attention, offering a unique decentralized VPN application and community-first tokenomics. This could be the best cheap crypto to buy now, with a promising future ahead. Qubetics Application: A Game-Changer for Businesses and Individuals Qubetics ($TICS) is a standout Web3 aggregator that unites leading blockchains, aiming to tackle issues that Bitcoin and Arbitrum haven’t fully addressed, such as decentralized privacy and security. Currently in its final public sale phase, Qubetics offers an innovative solution with a decentralized VPN application designed to secure both personal and business transactions. By offering the Qubetics presale, participants can engage with a project that combines technological innovation with a strong community-driven ethos. With the market dynamics shifting, this presents a unique opportunity for those looking to get involved early and reap the rewards of a rising blockchain network. For everyday users, Qubetics offers an unparalleled level of security. It works on a global scale, allowing individuals to browse the internet safely and privately, bypassing censorship and geo-restrictions without compromising on speed. Businesses can also integrate this decentralized VPN into their operations to protect sensitive data, ensuring smooth and secure operations across borders. As the best cheap crypto to buy now, Qubetics offers a forward-thinking approach to the decentralized internet, combining cutting-edge technology with an ecosystem that values user control and decentralization. The combination of its decentralized VPN application and blockchain technology makes it not just a promising token but a tangible tool for businesses and individuals alike. The real-world use cases and immediate benefits of the Qubetics platform make it an attractive choice for early adopters. Qubetics Presale: A Golden Opportunity for Early Adopters The Qubetics crypto presale is reaching its final stage, and this is your last chance to secure $TICS tokens before the price increases. With the current price of $0.3370 and only 9 million tokens left, the presale is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get in before the listing price increases by 20%. Over $18.1 million has already been raised, and more than 516 million tokens have been sold, indicating strong demand for the project. By participating in the Qubetics presale, early adopters have the potential to see significant returns once the token lists at $0.40. The price is expected to rise even further as the community-driven ecosystem grows, fueled by its scarcity and robust demand. Analysts are predicting a price surge in the next market cycle, and if Qubetics reaches anywhere between $5 and $10, a $10,000 investment today could turn into $150,000 to $300,000. The presale’s success is driven by a tokenomics overhaul that has reduced the total supply from over 4 billion to just 1.36 billion $TICS tokens. This reduction in supply creates scarcity, which is a major driver of value in any cryptocurrency market. Moreover, the increased allocation of tokens for the public sale, now set at 38.55%, shifts more control to the community, reinforcing the decentralized and user-governed ethos of Qubetics. For those looking for the best cheap crypto to buy now, Qubetics provides an exciting presale opportunity with a strong potential for growth. It’s a project that combines long-term value with short-term potential, making it a top pick for early participants. Bitcoin: The King of Crypto Faces Volatility Bitcoin, the world’s first cryptocurrency, is still regarded as the most important and valuable token in the crypto market. However, its price has experienced a 1.26% decline in the last 24 hours, with the current price hovering around $101,541.74. The 24-hour trading volume is at $62.36 billion, representing 36.7% of Bitcoin’s market cap, which stands at $2.01 trillion. Despite its position as the #1 crypto, Bitcoin has seen fluctuations recently, with a low of $98,286.21 and a high of $102,991.74 within the last day. Bitcoin’s market cap is far ahead of its competitors, yet it faces challenges like scalability and transaction speed. It has a total supply of 21 million BTC, with 19.88 million currently in circulation. While Bitcoin has become a store of value for many, its price volatility can present challenges for users looking for stability in a crypto asset. Nonetheless, Bitcoin continues to be a benchmark for the industry, and many consider it a safe long-term bet. Arbitrum: The Layer-2 Solution for Ethereum’s Scaling Problem Arbitrum (ARB) has been gaining attention as a solution to Ethereum’s scalability issues. With its layer-2 protocol, Arbitrum allows for faster and cheaper transactions while maintaining the security of Ethereum’s mainnet. Currently priced at $0.2692, Arbitrum has a market cap of $1.33 billion, with 4.96 billion ARB tokens in circulation. Arbitrum’s price has recently dropped by 1.43% in the last 24 hours, with the low being $0.2545 and the high $0.2746. This decline is part of a larger trend, with Arbitrum’s all-time high of $2.40 seen in January 2024. The price has since dropped 88.77%, showing both the potential for future growth and the risks involved in holding ARB. However, Arbitrum remains a key player in the Ethereum ecosystem, and its ability to solve Ethereum’s transaction issues gives it long-term potential. Conclusion: The Best Cheap Crypto to Buy Now As the cryptocurrency market continues to grow, both Bitcoin and Arbitrum have cemented their places in the industry, though they face challenges related to scalability and volatility. However, Qubetics presents a fresh opportunity, offering unique solutions with its decentralized VPN application and community-driven governance. With its ongoing presale, which has already raised over $18.1 million, Qubetics could be the best cheap crypto to buy now for those looking to capitalize on a promising Web3 platform. For those eager to join the next big wave in crypto, don’t miss the chance to join this best crypto presale and secure your place in this fast-growing ecosystem.

2025-06-25T10:14:00,"BNB Is Solid, BTC Eyes $150K As Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Turns Into Top Crypto Of 2025","Bitcoin has been testing a new breakout, with analysts forecasting that it could rise to $120,000 in July 2025. With optimism high, with a dash of uncertainty, investors are gearing up for an exciting summer 2025.

According to analysts, Bitcoin could trade up to a high of $120,000 in 2025 and rise to over $150,000 by 2030. That would represent a massive 50% increase in just five years. However, while the hard figures look big, they pale when compared to those of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Analysts forecast that MUTM tokens could rise by as much as 3,550% when they go live. That would be over 17 times bigger gains than what BTC investors can hope to get in the next five years. A Deep Dive into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized non-custodial protocol where users can join as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. As lenders, they deposit their assets in the liquidity pools to earn interest. The interest rate in a pool is set by the pool utilization rate. As more borrowers take loans from the pools, the utilization rate rises, which increases the interest rate. A rising interest rate pushes borrowers to repay their loans to avoid the rising costs, which encourages more lenders to deposit their assets to benefit from the high yields. The result is that protocol liquidity grows, while the lending costs come down. Consequently, the ecosystem achieves optimal capital efficiency while increasing the user base. To boost liquidity in the pools, thus lowering borrowing costs, the team will implement a liquidity mining program. In this program, lenders will be rewarded in MUTM tokens for depositing liquidity in the pool. The program will focus on high-value assets that are in high demand on the protocol. As a result, it preserves liquidity in the protocol even during highly volatile market conditions. Not all assets qualify for liquidity mining. By strategically moving incentives to select tokens, it can boost stability and discourage token inflation. Only tokens with high liquidity and low volatility will be included in the program due to their important role in the protocol. Meanwhile, small assets with high volatility will not be added to the liquidity rewards program due to their potential to introduce instability into the ecosystem. Liquidity Protections When it comes to liquidity protection, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has several strict measures in place. One of these is that all loans by borrowers must be overcollateralized. That simply means that they deposit collateral that is worth more than the value of the loan they take. Additionally, they have a token vetting process that ensures only secure tokens can be used on the protocol. For instance, tokens prone to price manipulation or centralization cannot be allowed on the platform. If they were allowed, they could use various exploits, including infinite token minting, to take liquidity from the pools. The protocol will also rely on asset caps and restrictions. For instance, they can restrict certain assets from being used as collateral, or restrict them to only being used to borrow assets at the same time. Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) team will also intervene to adjust core parameters to protocol liquidity in the pool. These core parameters can include the optimal utilization rate per asset and the interest rate slopes. Doing so will ensure that rates on Mutuum Finance are competitive with external platforms. Consequently, it will keep arbitrageurs from raiding the platform to take liquidity and use it on more lucrative platforms. The MUTM Token Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in phase 5 of the presale, where tokens are going for $0.03. The current price is a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. In the upcoming phase 6, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. So far, over $11 million worth of tokens have been sold to around 12,400 unique buyers. The presale has attracted a lot of attention, with 47% of the tokens set aside for phase 5 selling out barely two weeks after they launched. A major incentive for the pace has been the positive forecast of gains of up to 3,550%. Based on this price, a $1,600 purchase could grow to $56,800. That is a massive return that no serious investor wants to miss out on. Conclusion Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in an exciting phase of its presale where buyers stand to make a 50% discount on their purchase compared to those who wait until the token listing price of $0.06. Best of all, this opportunity is available to everyone with no upper or lower limit on how many MUTM tokens you can purchase.

2025-06-25T10:10:09,"A Huge Crypto Move Concerning Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Two Altcoins Came From a Chinese Company!","As institutional investors continue to see the power of cryptocurrencies, reserve plans are being announced one after another. At this point, the latest reserve news came from a company listed on Nasdaq called Aurora Mobile. Accordingly, the Chinese company Aurora Mobile has chosen four cryptocurrencies as part of its reserve strategy: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and SUI. Aurora Mobile has approved the investment of up to 20% of the company’s and its consolidated assets’ cash and equivalents in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and SUI. “Aurora Mobile will invest up to 20% of the Company's and its consolidated entities' cash and cash equivalents in cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. These investments may include, but are not limited to, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, SUI and other tokens. This decision reflects the Company's commitment to innovative treasury practices and focus on creating long-term value for shareholders.” Aurora Mobile Chairman Mr. Weidong Luo said: “By investing in digital assets, we increase our portfolio diversification by gaining exposure to cryptocurrencies, an asset class with low correlation to traditional markets. We are also providing a foothold in forward-thinking innovation by keeping up with technological advances that are reshaping global finance.” Yesterday, another Chinese company, Nano Labs, announced that it included BNB as part of its treasury strategy. According to the official statement, Nano Labs announced that it has signed a $500 million convertible note agreement for the purchase of Binance Coin (BNB).

2025-06-25T10:10:06,"Coinbase Aids Secret Service in Record $225M Crypto Scam Bust","Crypto exchange Coinbase has revealed its pivotal role in assisting the U.S. Secret Service with an investigation that led to the seizure of $225 million worth of crypto linked to investment scams . Notably, officials described the event as the agency’s largest crypto-related seizure to date. The Department of Justice filed for the forfeiture on June 18, recovering funds allegedly stolen through a “pig butchering” scheme—a long-term social engineering scam that manipulates victims into fraudulent crypto investments. Coinbase announced in a blog post on Tuesday that it collaborated closely with the Secret Service in 2024 alongside several other exchanges, helping to identify victims and track stolen funds through blockchain analytics. Coinbase Traced the Scams and Froze the Funds Between February 26 and February 29, 2024, Coinbase’s investigative team tracked millions of dollars in transactions tied to illicit wallets and flagged suspicious account activity. This effort allowed the Secret Service to identify over 130 Coinbase customers who had unknowingly fallen victim to the scam, representing losses of $2.3 million. The investigation further revealed that many of the frozen assets were linked to over 140 accounts on OKX. According to Coinbase, these accounts were allegedly controlled by individuals detained in Southeast Asian scam compounds—facilities often tied to human trafficking and digital fraud operations. Similarly, stablecoin issuer Tether played a critical role by freezing 39 wallet addresses containing the stolen $225 million in USDT in 2023. Tether later burned the tokens, a process that permanently removes them from circulation, and reissued an equivalent amount of USDT to a wallet under Secret Service control. Coinbase also noted that the entire process was transparent and verifiable onchain, demonstrating how blockchain technology can support real-time law enforcement action. A Growing Trend of Global Crypto Seizures The seizure highlights a growing trend among international authorities targeting stolen digital assets. In May, the Australian Federal Police seized nearly 25 Bitcoin, valued at over $2.6 million, tied to a 2013 heist involving 950 stolen BTC from a French crypto exchange. Earlier in February, German authorities confiscated €34 million (roughly $38 million) from eXch , a crypto platform allegedly used to launder funds following the $1.4 billion Bybit hack. As scammers increasingly exploit crypto’s global reach, collaborative investigations like this demonstrate that blockchain’s transparency can be used as a powerful tool for justice.
