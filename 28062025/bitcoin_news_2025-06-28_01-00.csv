2025-06-27T22:44:48,"South Korean Lawmaker Proposes ETF Bill to Include Virtual Assets","Key Takeaways: A bill proposes expanding South Korea’s Capital Markets Act to include digital assets as underlying ETF assets. Trust companies could legally hold and manage digital assets, under clearer rules for delegation and custody. Some industry figures warn that brokering derivatives tied to digital assets requires rigorous risk controls. Min Byung-deok, a member of South Korea Democratic Party, introduced a bill on June 27 to amend the Capital Markets Act, according to News1 . The proposal would expand the scope of underlying assets for ETFs to include digital assets like Bitcoin. The amendment establishes a legal framework allowing trust companies to hold and manage digital assets as trust property. It also outlines conditions for delegating custody of virtual assets to registered service providers. Lawmaker Proposes Bill to Enable Digital Asset-Based ETFs The bill is part of President Lee Jae-myung’s agenda to integrate digital assets into the financial system. A separate roadmap from the Financial Services Commission would permit institutional investors with more than KRW 10 billion in assets to trade virtual assets beginning in late 2025. Supporters say the amendment provides a legal foundation for digital asset-based ETFs and improves investor protections through clear rules on trust management. It also includes measures to expand the derivatives market, allowing risk management strategies using digital assets. Skeptics argue that brokering digital asset derivatives requires strict risk management. Some industry participants say only firms with sufficient capacity should be allowed to offer such products. Currently, South Korea prohibits ETFs that use digital assets as underlying assets, forcing domestic investors to trade abroad or rely on unregulated markets. The new measure could create a regulated pathway to participate in this market domestically. South Korea Moves Forward Amid Global Uncertainty If approved, the amendment would let asset managers develop financial products tied to digital assets, increase ETF market diversity, and boost transparency and oversight in the sector. Min said the bill would promote growth while strengthening protections for Korean investors. While global regulators weigh frameworks for digital asset ETFs, many jurisdictions still grapple with basic questions of valuation, custody, and cross-border compliance. In the absence of uniform standards, countries often move at different speeds, which can lead to regulatory arbitrage and inconsistent protections for investors. Industry observers say any shift in ETF rules could influence broader debates over digital asset taxation, reporting standards, and how digital finance fits into national growth strategies. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Why are some concerned about derivatives provisions? Critics argue that derivatives tied to digital assets involve risks that should be managed by firms with sufficient risk controls. How does this compare with global trends? While the U.S. has approved Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs, many countries still debate rules around custody, taxation, and investor protections. Could this affect other parts of South Korea’s financial regulation? Potentially. Analysts say ETF rules often intersect with tax policy, reporting standards, and national digital finance strategies.

A massive pile of platinum has accumulated under the moon’s surface, according to a paper published in the journal Planetary and Space Science. Lead researcher Jayanth Chennamangalam tells New Scientist that the trillion-dollar estimate stems from findings that around 6,500 lunar craters, each at least 1 kilometer wide, contain significant platinum group metal (PGM) deposits from asteroid impacts. The study spotlights the commercial potential of resources in space, which could attract private investment and reduce reliance on government funding for space exploration. And lunar mining could be far more viable than extracting resources from near-Earth asteroids, with the moon offering a vastly larger number of potential mining sites. Beyond its appeal in jewelry, platinum is coveted for its strength and vital use in high-tech applications, powering everything from clean energy solutions to life-saving medical equipment. The precious metal’s price has soared this year, climbing over 30% to around $1,400 per troy ounce, driven by a global supply deficit and rising demand from the automotive and jewelry sectors.

2025-06-27T22:01:48,"Mexican Man Sentenced to Over Eight Years in Prison for Using Crypto To Launder $5,500,000 in Illicit Drug Money","A Mexican national has been sentenced to eight years and four months in prison as a major player in a drug money laundering conspiracy that used crypto. According to a new U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) press release , Jose “Meno” Martinez of Guadalajara, Mexico, helped drug traffickers launder money in Mexico. Martinez laundered $5.5 million in drug money, transferring the funds to Mexico via crypto while keeping a percentage fee for himself. As a result of Martinez’s dealings, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has seized $1.35 million in bulk US currency, in addition to “approximately 3 kilograms of fentanyl, 52.77 kilograms of cocaine, 7,078.63 kilograms of unconverted methamphetamine in the form of charcoal lumps, 170 gallons of unconverted methamphetamine in the form of coconut oil, 140 kilograms of methamphetamine and 15 gallons of liquid methamphetamine.” Earlier this week, the DOJ also announced that two Florida men are facing the possibility of multiple decades in prison after allegedly masterminding a fraudulent scheme to steal over $100 million from a nonprofit organization set up to manage funds for people with special needs and disabilities. The DOJ alleges that Leo Joseph Govoni, John Leo Witeck and one unnamed co-conspirator purloined the Center for Special Needs Trust Administration client-beneficiary funds and concealed their embezzlement through complex financial transactions, allegedly sending fraudulent account statements with false balances to their disabled clients.

2025-06-27T22:00:45,"Bitcoin Forms 4-Year Inverse H&S Pattern – Neckline Break Could Send It Parabolic","Bitcoin is showing resilience above the $105,000 mark, holding firm despite ongoing volatility and economic uncertainty. While bulls struggle to break above the all-time high at $112,000, the market remains in a high-stakes consolidation phase. Macroeconomic conditions remain unstable, with weak global growth forecasts and elevated inflation pushing investors into risk-off assets. Still, Bitcoin appears to be thriving under these pressures, strengthening its case as a hedge against traditional financial instability. Related Reading: Ethereum Fakes Out Bears – Altcoin Rally Depends On Key Level Breakout Top analyst Carl Runefelt recently highlighted a compelling technical development: Bitcoin is forming a massive inverse head and shoulders pattern spanning the last four years. This rare and long-term formation typically signals a bullish reversal and, if confirmed, could mark the beginning of a powerful breakout into price discovery. Runefelt notes that the neckline of this pattern aligns with current resistance just below $112K, making the coming weeks crucial for market direction. As the crypto market digests geopolitical tensions, central bank policy shifts, and on-chain accumulation trends, Bitcoin’s ability to stay elevated signals growing investor conviction. All eyes are now on whether BTC can complete this historic pattern and launch the next leg of the bull run. Bitcoin At A Critical Crossroads Bitcoin is trading at a pivotal level that could determine the market’s next major move — a breakout into new all-time highs or a retrace toward lower demand zones. After surging over 10% since last Sunday, the bullish sentiment is building rapidly, but the price remains stuck in a tight range between $100,000 and $110,000. Bulls are confident and in control of momentum, yet they’ve repeatedly failed to push BTC above the key $110K resistance. At the same time, bears have been unable to take the price below the $100K psychological support, signaling equilibrium and mounting pressure for a breakout. This standoff has kept volatility high, with macroeconomic uncertainty and geopolitical instability adding fuel to the fire. Still, the current market structure appears constructive for Bitcoin. If bulls can finally break above the $110K level and push into price discovery, it would confirm the strength behind this rally and potentially spark a new phase of exponential growth. Carl Runefelt believes a major breakout may be on the horizon. His technical analysis reveals a massive inverse head and shoulders pattern forming over the last four years — a rare and highly bullish setup. According to Runefelt, traders should be “ready for a crazy pump” if Bitcoin breaks through the neckline near $112K. Historically, this type of pattern precedes explosive rallies, and given the long-term nature of this one, the upside potential could be significant. As long-term holders accumulate and market liquidity builds, the coming weeks may determine whether Bitcoin cements its breakout or returns to test deeper support. Either way, this moment is shaping up to be one of the most decisive junctures in the current bull cycle. Related Reading: Ethereum Reclaims $2,444 Level – Bullish Continuation In Focus BTC Price Analysis: Key Resistance Blocks Price Discovery Bitcoin is currently trading at $107,144 on the daily chart, showing modest gains but facing strong resistance as it nears the $109,300 level. The chart highlights a clearly defined horizontal structure between $103,600 and $109,300 — a range Bitcoin has respected for nearly two months. Bulls remain in control short term, having reclaimed all three major moving averages: the 50-day ($105,800), 100-day ($96,784), and 200-day ($96,136) SMAs. The most recent bounce off the $103,600 support zone was followed by rising volume, indicating a potential shift in momentum back to the upside. However, BTC has yet to close convincingly above $109,300, which continues to cap any price discovery attempts. A breakout above this level could open the door to new all-time highs and trigger an aggressive bullish continuation. Related Reading: Chainlink Reclaims Key Structure – Quiet Accumulation Could Fuel $25–$30 Surge On the downside, failure to breach resistance and a drop below $105K could reintroduce bearish pressure and trigger a retest of the lower range. For now, Bitcoin remains range-bound with bullish bias, but buyers need to follow through with strong volume and a clean break above the $109K barrier to fully confirm market intent. Until then, caution is warranted as indecision prevails near key resistance.

2025-06-27T22:00:28,"Top Developments On The XRP Ledger To Keep An Eye On","The XRP Ledger (XRPL) has witnessed some developments in recent times, which are set to boost the network’s activity. This includes the Wormhole integration, which enables interoperability and unlocks access to other networks. XRP Ledger Integrates Wormhole For Network Interoperability In an X post , Wormhole announced that it has partnered with Ripple to bring multichain interoperability to the XRP Ledger and the upcoming XRPL EVM Sidechain . Wormhole will be the core interoperability platform for the XRPL ecosystem. This integration will further expand the network’s adoption, as users will now be able to transfer their assets from the XRPL to other major networks. Wormhole also noted that this would bring new connectivity for developers and institutions looking to build multichain applications, whether for payments, DeFi, and RWA use cases. The XRP Ledger continues to expand, considering the integration and launch of new initiatives on the network, including the recent integration of Circle’s USDC stablecoin . Furthermore, Bitcoinist reported that the European Central Bank (ECB) is testing the XRP Ledger for bond settlement. Specifically, the ECB is working on the Axiology DLT Trading and Settlement System (TSS). However, it is worth mentioning that Axiology is a “private, permissioned infrastructure” which is built using the XRPL’s open-source code. As such, this bond settlement won’t exactly run on the network. Ripple Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David Schwartz declared that Real World Assets (RWAs) will drive the next wave of adoption for the XRP Ledger. This explains why the network is actively promoting asset tokenization. Ondo Finance recently launched its tokenized US Treasury fund (OUSG) on the network. Meanwhile, Guggenheim partnered with Ripple to launch the first Digital Commercial Paper on the XRPL. XRPL Gets A New Lift With Software Upgrade The XRPL Ledger is also set to witness new improvements with the Rippled 2.5.0 version , which just went live. The network upgrade includes major features such as a permissioned decentralized exchange (DEX). This adds DEXs that control who can participate and allows for compliant trading. It marks a major step towards onboarding institutions as these regulated players can trade on the XRP Ledger’s DEX using verified credentials. The feature also enables KYC-gated FX swaps and stablecoin flows. Essentially, this permissioned DEX feature promotes compliance and is expected to attract more developers. Another feature introduced by the XRP Ledger upgrade is Permission Delegation, which enables accounts to delegate permissions to other accounts for management and automation purposes. In an X post , Ripple developers explained that the potential use cases for this feature include MiCA compliance, RLUSD stablecoin operations, and corporate treasury management. The upgrade also introduces support for IOUs and MPTs under token escrow. The XRP Ledger’s escrow feature would support other tokens besides XRP. There is also the batch feature, which adds the ability to group multiple transactions and execute them together. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.09, down over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/top-developments-on-xrp-ledger/,"AAVE|ADA|ALGO|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CFX|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","XRP|Coinmarketcap|Decentralized Exchange|DEX|ECB|European Central Bank|IOUs|MiCA Compliance|MPTs|Ondo Finance|real-world assets|Rippled 2.5.0 Version|RLUSD|RWA|stablecoin|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPL EVM Sidechain|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT",cryptocompare

As Bitcoin continues to show strength, several meme coins have seen a slight decline in buzz, including Doge , which has traded relatively calmly over the last three days. BTC is gathering liquidity for a major move, though volume is likely to flow back into top meme coins if the price consolidates. Other flagship crypto assets, like BCH and ETH, posted a minor increase today, while Dog currently sees the most gain among the top 20 meme coins, as Fartcoin and Popcat shed major losses in the last 24 hours. Solana-Based Meme Are Still Popping Out Gains For Bitcoin, which still remains strong on the intraday trading, tokens on the Solana network are still trying to stay afloat amid the current daily price shakeout, especially the newly launched ones on the Dex, which are now popping insane gains like Mori, Joboy and Farthouse. While Sui network floods with undervalued meme coins are capped under $120 million, yet to get investors’ attention for a long-term gain due to low hype and weak community base, Brett -7%, Toshi -7% and Degen -12% are currently down as they lead meme coins chart on Base. Aside from Ethereum and BSC-based assets, some Artificial Intelligence tokens on Virtuals are also not left behind in the latest reductions as they have recorded major losses since yesterday. Alpha Tokens on CEXs Defy The Odds Since Bitcoin’s price bounced back last weekend, assets on the Alpha sector have gained more trading attention than any other for a couple of days. In fact, they currently defy the latest market odds as several meme coins see a sizeable volume outflow in the past hours. In contrast to the recent drops in meme coin prices, many Alpha tokens trading on CEXs have remained in the spotlight as Bitcoin sustains momentum. If the primary cryptocurrency continues to show strength, tokens in this sector may gain more traction as the market demand increases daily. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Instant exchanges let everyone bounce between these worlds, swapping Bitcoin for Ethereum to catch a dip or diving into Monero for privacy. It’s about staying nimble in a market that’s always on the move.

2025-06-27T21:15:00,"Trump Coin Price Prediction: Chart Shows 100% Move Coming Up – Time to Buy?","The downward consolidation that has capped Trump coin price action since mid-May is nearing its breakout point, strengthening the short-term price outlook with a potential 2x move. While the April setup featured a 20-day continuation pattern, the current formation flashes a classic reversal pattern that has developed over 60 days—a prolonged buildup of momentum. Meme coins continue to struggle under the FUD of geopolitical tensions, with the Israel-Iran conflict unresolved—TRUMP remains 45% below its presidential dinner peak. Derivatives Traders Are Betting on a TRUMP Rally Open interest is showing signs of recovery, rising 3% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGlass data . Speculative interest is building with traders actively following WIF price moves.

With a bounce from the lower support of a falling wedge in the early week—a classic bullish reversal pattern—the TRUMP coin price appears to be approaching a key breakout point. TRUMP / USDT 1-day price chart, bullish falling wedge reversal pattern. Source: TradingView, Binance. A confluence zone is now forming where historic accumulation just below $9.15 intersects with the wedge’s upper resistance trendline, increasing pressure for an upside move. Momentum indicators support the bullish setup. The MACD line has widened its marginal lead above the signal line following a golden cross—an early sign that a trend reversal is taking root. More so, the RSI has rebounded from oversold territory at 30, signaling seller exhaustion and presenting buyers with an opportunity to take control of the prevailing trend. If this setup mirrors the April breakout from a symmetrical triangle—a continuation pattern—a similar 2x gain could be on the cards, targeting the early March peak at $17.70. This local top marked the market trajectory pre-tariff war. With a US-China trade deal and potential for an EU trade deal soon, these past headwinds may be clearing for a continuation. The European Union has expressed its readiness to negotiate a trade agreement with the United States. pic.twitter.com/rki2CLvn6R — Okenwa Crypto. (@OkenwaCrypto1) June 26, 2025 However, considering the two-month build-up of the falling wedge, pressure could push an upward move even higher towards the February post-inauguration rally top around $24. Still, if the accumulation zone fails, the bullish setup could be invalidated. The next key support lies at $7.15, a 20% drop from current prices to retest the mid-April market bottom. Bitcoin Could be the Bigger Play – With Some Help Those who jumped to more speculative plays like TRUMP coin over the leading crypto may be forced to reconsider as the Bitcoin ecosystem finally addresses its biggest limitation: scalability. Slow transactions, high fees, and limited programmability have held it back from competing with the Ethereum and Solana networks—until now. And this shift starts with Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , Bitcoin’s first real-time Layer 2 that brings Solana-level speed and smart contracts directly to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) and anchored by a decentralized Canonical Bridge, it enables fast, cheap, and composable dApps—all while staying secured by Bitcoin.

According to the data, a major crypto whale deposited $20 million worth of USDC stablecoin into decentralized cryptocurrency exchange Hyperliquid and used $5.97 million of that to purchase the exchange’s HYPE token. The whale wallet purchased a total of 165,366 HYPE, paying an average of $36.08 for each token. At the time of writing, the HYPE price is trading at 36.04, almost at the level where the whale wallet made the purchase.

2025-06-27T21:00:49,"Chainlink (LINK) On Standby: Bitcoin’s Next Move Holds The Key","Chainlink (LINK) ended its latest session in a holding pattern, with indecisive candles and choppy intraday action pointing to a lack of clear direction. Traders now look to Bitcoin’s next move for guidance; any meaningful shift in BTC dominance could quickly tilt LINK’s price action. Until the market leader shows its hand, LINK remains on standby, hovering near key support while waiting for a decisive cue. Falling Wedge Holds The Key To Chainlink Next Big Move In a recent X post, CRYPTOWZRD provided an update on Chainlink’s daily technical outlook, noting that the daily candles for both LINK and LINKBTC closed indecisively. This indecision reflects uncertainty in the market as traders await clearer direction. The lack of a strong trend suggests a pause before the next significant move. Related Reading: Chainlink Bears Push Toward $12.50 As Weekend Volatility Looms The analyst highlighted that LINKBTC is currently forming a falling wedge pattern, which is generally considered a bullish formation, especially when it appears in oversold conditions. He stressed that a breakout from this wedge is essential for Chainlink to trigger the next impulsive move upward, signaling a potential shift in momentum. CRYPTOWZRD explained that this breakout is more likely to occur once Bitcoin dominance begins to decline. As Bitcoin’s grip loosens, altcoins like LINK tend to gain strength and follow suit. Therefore, monitoring Bitcoin dominance will be key in anticipating LINK’s next move. Regarding support levels, CRYPTOWZRD identified $12.50 as the critical next support target. A strong reversal from this point could ignite a rally toward the $16 resistance level or higher. This level will serve as a crucial testing ground for bullish momentum. He concluded by mentioning that his focus remains on lower-timeframe charts to identify quick scalp opportunities. While the broader trend is developing, CRYPTOWZRD is looking to capitalize on shorter-term movements, keeping a close eye on price action and volatility. Choppy Intraday Action Keeps Bulls Cautious Wrapping up the analysis, the analyst highlighted that LINK’s intraday chart remained sluggish and choppy, offering little in terms of clear directional bias. A possible retest of the $12.85 support level—or even a minor dip below it—could still present a bullish reversal opportunity, potentially paving the way for a push toward the $14.40 resistance target. Related Reading: Chainlink Holders Set Record As 1-Yr MVRV Signals ‘Opportunity’ However, the analyst warned that if Chainlink holds below the $12.85 level, it could slip into prolonged sideways movement. This uncertain behavior will likely hinge on Bitcoin’s overall market direction, which continues to heavily influence altcoin performance. With no clear trade setup currently in play, the analyst concluded that it’s best to remain patient for a cleaner structure to emerge before making any decisive moves.

2025-06-27T20:55:08,"XRP news: Ripple’s legal loss, $439m transfer ignite selloff dominoes","A legal battle hanging in limbo and a mysterious $439 million XRP transfer by Ripple coincided with a brutal wave of long liquidations that saw traders caught in the crossfire. The turbulence began shortly after U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres rejected a proposed settlement between Ripple Labs ( XRP ) and the SEC, dashing hopes of a swift resolution to the years-long securities lawsuit. Almost simultaneously, blockchain trackers spotted Ripple moving half a billion dollars’ worth of XRP to an undisclosed wallet, just as leveraged traders were piling into bullish bets. These events spooked the market, triggering a cascade of liquidations totaling $7.18 million, with longs outnumbering shorts by nearly 10-to-1, according to CoinGlass data. While the broader crypto sector showed signs of stabilization, XRP’s lopsided positioning turned a 5.3% drop into a bloodbath for overexposed traders, revealing the token’s overreliance on speculative optimism, with little defense against Ripple’s own corporate moves or legal headwinds. How Ripple’s corporate moves and legal woes likely fueled XRP’s decline The $7.18 million long liquidation event was the culmination of mounting pressure from Ripple’s opaque treasury management and unresolved legal battles. While Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) weathered broader market turbulence with relative stability, XRP’s 45.62% drop from its all-time high of $3.84 underscores a deeper issue: the token’s price action remains disproportionately tied to Ripple’s corporate decisions rather than organic demand. This week’s 5.3% slide, while not extreme in isolation, struck hard because of its timing. It came just as traders were positioning for a potential breakout above the $2.17 resistance. Judge Analisa Torres’ rejection of Ripple’s proposed SEC settlement reinforced the market’s worst fears. Without clarity on whether XRP will face stricter securities enforcement, institutional players remain hesitant to commit. This regulatory limbo has kept XRP range-bound between $2.00 and $2.60 since March, despite the token’s CME futures listing and whispers of a potential ETF. For traders, the message is clear: until the SEC case concludes, XRP’s upside will be capped by skepticism. Add in Ripple’s $439 million transfer to a shadow wallet, and the market had the perfect recipe for forced deleveraging. RLUSD Minting Amid the chaos, Ripple has quietly accelerated its stablecoin ambitions, minting 50 million RLUSD this month alone. The move aligns with the booming $252 billion stablecoin market, where giants like Tether and Circle generate massive revenue from Treasury-backed reserves. If RLUSD gains traction, it could provide Ripple with a lucrative revenue stream independent of XRP’s volatility. But for XRP holders, the bigger question is whether RLUSD adoption will translate into ecosystem stability. In theory, deeper liquidity and institutional use cases for Ripple’s stablecoin could bolster demand for XRP as a bridge asset. However, if RLUSD overshadows XRP in Ripple’s own financial strategy, the token risks becoming an afterthought in the company’s long-term vision.",crypto_news,https://crypto.news/xrp-news-ripples-legal-loss-439m-transfer-ignite-selloff-dominoes/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP","News|Ripple|SEC|XRP",cryptocompare
2025-06-27T20:44:51,"Kraken Launches Krak: P2P App for Crypto and Fiat in 110 Countries","Kraken, the world's oldest crypto exchange, has unveiled Krak, the next-generation peer-to-peer payments app that seeks to merge the freedom of cryptocurrency with the convenience of everyday finance. “Krak is live! Send crypto or fiat to anyone, anywhere, instantly—no banks, no borders, no fees. This is the future.” — @krakenfx Compatible with 110 countries, Krak allows users to send, receive, and store over 300 assets—from cryptocurrencies and stablecoins to local fiat—beyond the restriction of traditional banks or wallet addresses. How Krak Works At its essence, Krak is designed for a digital-native generation. The app allows users to send money across the world in seconds, via a unique payment ID called a Kraktag—no bank information or crypto wallet addresses needed. Be it sending Bitcoin to a friend in Berlin or euros to relatives in Lagos, Krak processes in-app for fiat and on-chain for crypto, keeping things speedy and inexpensive. Krak also features built-in crypto-to-fiat conversion, allowing users to instantly swap between digital assets and local currencies at competitive rates. The app’s intuitive interface supports recurring payments, bill splitting, and multi-currency wallets, making it ideal for freelancers, digital nomads, and families with cross-border ties. Early reviews praise Krak’s speed and transparency, highlighting its potential to disrupt both traditional banking and legacy payment apps. Launch-day key features : P2P transfers in 110 countries, on 300+ crypto and fiat currencies Kraktags for instant, private transfers Earn up to 4.1% on balances of USDG stablecoin, and up to 10% on 20+ digital assets No-lockup, minimum , or subscription spend and earn accounts Kraken's backend leverages its global network of money transmitter licenses and banking relationships to enable Krak to serve as an all-in-one financial center. Fee Structure, Rewards, and Future Roadmap Krak is becoming a ”PayPal-killer” with no or ultra-low fees on most transfers—especially against the 2–2.5% of the likes of Revolut and Cash App. Users can earn up to 4.1% on USDG balances and up to 10% on select digital assets, with rewards disbursed daily and no lock-ins. In the future, Kraken will launch: Physical and virtual Krak cards to spend at millions of merchants worldwide Advance-payment services like lending, loans, and credit cards Enhanced business and company instruments for global payroll and B2B payments International Expansion and Regulatory Barriers Kraken's move comes after years of building compliance infrastructure, licensing in the U.S., U.K., EU, Canada, and beyond. Krak is still not available in Australia and sanctioned regions, rollouts to roll out behind local regulation. The company's regulatory seriousness is considered to be a differentiation from less compliant fintech rivals. Competing With Coinbase, Revolut, and Cash App Krak's launch puts Kraken directly against fintech giants. Compared to Coinbase, Krak offers broader asset coverage and lower fees but is still more convenient for new users. Compared to Revolut, Krak offers more cryptocurrency functionality, higher yields, and lower transaction fees. Cash App and Venmo dominate U.S. P2P payments but have less broad crypto coverage and higher fees. Bottom line With Krak, Kraken is betting that the future of money is instant, borderless, and multi-asset. By meshing the agility of crypto with the convenience of everyday payments, Kraken is going to serve traders, yes, but also anyone who has to send, spend, and make their money worldwide—without the hassles of old banking.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9740/kraken-launches-krak-p2-p-app-for-crypto-and-fiat-in-110-countries,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

2025-06-27T20:25:10,"Number of Large Bitcoin Investors Surge to Multi-Month Highs: Do They Know Something?","On-chain data from the market intelligence platform Santiment shows that the number of wallets holding at least 10 BTC has returned to levels not seen since March. This surge in whale and shark activity coincides with massive institutional inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs and signals deep-pocketed confidence despite recent price consolidation below critical resistance. Whales Feast Amidst Retail Jitters According to Santiment, there has been a spike in the number of whale and shark wallets holding over 10 BTC, equivalent to over $1.07 million at the current price. The number has steadily grown in the last few weeks to hit 152,280, a level last seen on March 12, reflecting long-term optimism from experienced investors. These heavy hitters typically act during moments of retail panic, scooping up discounted BTC in what analysts call “smart money” behavior. This activity dovetails with a recent observation from market watcher Axel Adler Jr., who earlier in the week pointed out that despite $66 billion in realized profits over the past two months, mainly from short-term holders, Bitcoin’s price has held firm. In his assessment, the resilience was largely due to new demand absorbing these sell-offs, indicating significant buy-side strength. Moreover, earlier in the month, Binance saw nearly 4,500 BTC withdrawn in a single day, with over $800 million in stablecoin inflows that same week. The dual action of BTC exiting exchanges and fresh liquidity arriving was a possible pointer to a deep accumulation phase, potentially led by whales positioning for future upside. ETF flows also add another dimension to the story, with reports of U.S. spot BTC ETFs pulling in nearly $1.5 billion in just three days, marking one of its most aggressive accumulation periods since inception. BlackRock’s IBIT was at the forefront of this charge, purchasing 9,400 BTC this week alone. Price Action Stagnant At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $107,353, down slightly by 0.4% in the last 24 hours and a more noticeable 2.6% for the week. This means that despite a respectable 3.1% uptick over the past fortnight, the king cryptocurrency still underperformed the broader crypto market, which had gained 3% over seven days. The asset previously touched $108,066 but failed to hold that level, with investor Daan Crypto Trades noting that it is consolidating just under the critical $108,000 to $110,000 resistance zone. In his estimation, a breakout from the current wedge pattern could open the path to a new all-time high for BTC, provided it clears the range. Bitcoin’s dominance is also up. It is currently at 62.8% but previously reached 65.7%, its highest level in four years, suggesting that capital is flowing into BTC rather than altcoins.

The analyst, pseudonymously known as Capo, tells his 128,716 Telegram subscribers that Solana ( SOL ) is currently testing a resistance level that was previously a support zone. According to Capo, Solana could fall by up to 58% from the current level after failing to break above a level last reached late last month. “After the current dead-cat bounce, it’s now testing another important resistance, which was support before (support/resistance flip). Main target remains $60 to $80.” Source: CryptoCapo/Telegram Solana is trading at $143 at time of writing, down by around 51% from the all-time high reached in January. Turning to Bitcoin ( BTC ), Capo says the crypto king is facing strong resistance at the level just below $109,000. Based on the pseudonymous analyst’s chart of the one-day time frame, it appears Capo is suggesting that Bitcoin could first fall to a support level around the price of $93,000. Capo also appears to suggest that Bitcoin could capitulate even further and revisit the zone between $60,000 and $70,000, levels last witnessed in October of 2024. “If you think we’ve seen it all… think again.” Source: CryptoCapo/Telegram Bitcoin is trading at $107,197 at time of writing, down by around 4% from the current level.

2025-06-27T20:00:30,"Bitcoin Gets The Greenlight To Be Counted As Assets For Mortgage Applications, But What About XRP?","A major breakthrough has just arrived for Bitcoin and the crypto industry from one of the most influential financial regulatory bodies in the United States. The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), which oversees the country’s largest mortgage liquidity providers, has issued a directive that could change how digital assets are viewed. Under this directive, mortgage liquidity providers have been officially ordered to begin preparations for considering cryptocurrencies as part of a borrower’s asset portfolio during mortgage evaluations. Crypto As Mortgage-Eligible Asset In a recent post on the social media platform X, FHFA Director Bill Pulte issued a directive instructing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to prepare proposals that allow homebuyers to count cryptocurrency holdings held on US-regulated exchanges as part of their asset reserves for mortgage applications without converting them into dollars. Related Reading: These Companies Are Following Saylor’s Strategy Into The Bitcoin Battleground With Over $2 Billion Slated To Buy BTC Crypto assets have always been excluded from mortgage risk assessments unless converted to U.S. dollars before closing. However, this recent move breaks that barrier. This policy shift aligns with former President Donald Trump’s campaigns to establish the United States as the crypto capital of the world. Pulte, who was recently sworn in as the 5th Director of U.S. Federal Housing FHFA in March 2025, is now part of those taking steps to make this vision a reality. According to the order, both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac must also factor in market volatility and enforce strong risk-based adjustments before implementing the new assessment method. Fannie and Freddie are government-sponsored enterprises that do not issue mortgages themselves but play an important role in the housing market by purchasing home loans on the secondary market and setting the criteria for the loans they are willing to acquire. Bitcoin To Benefit The Most, But Where Does XRP Stand? Bitcoin is going to benefit the most from this policy update. Being the largest and most widely held cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has long been considered the digital gold standard, which makes it a natural candidate for institutional recognition. Related Reading: Crypto Pundit Reveals Why This Bitcoin Bull Market Feels Different As Crypto Enters ‘New Era’ Its established presence on U.S.-regulated exchanges and deep liquidity profile through Spot Bitcoin ETFs tick nearly every box laid out in the FHFA’s directive. However, the decision raises an important question for XRP holders as to whether the same regulation will be extended to XRP. Unlike Bitcoin, XRP has had a complicated history with regulatory agencies in the US, most notably the SEC. Although recent legal clarity around XRP has allowed the crypto to resume trading on major US-based exchanges, it isn’t really certain whether Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will be quick to include it under this new directive. Nonetheless, the FHFA’s directive doesn’t specify eligible tokens. It simply refers to cryptocurrencies held on US-regulated exchanges. As such, the directive could be quick to include US-based cryptocurrencies like XRP and Ethereum alongside Bitcoin. Other countries are already far ahead with XRP in real estate. In Japan, for instance, Open House Group allows XRP payments for property purchases in cities such as Tokyo and Osaka. Dubai is also using the XRP Ledger to tokenize real estate.

2025-06-27T20:00:00,"Bitcoin Hits 105K As One DeFi Token Gets Ready To Explode 4,300%","The crypto market is roaring again after Trump announced a deal had been reached with Iran and Israel. After briefly falling below $100k as tensions escalated in the Middle East, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) has recovered to over $105,000. One of the factors that has allowed Bitcoin (BTC) to remain relatively stable throughout the conflict is the growing institutional interest in BTC. US-traded Bitcoin Spot ETFs have seen continued inflows, which signals that investor confidence remains high. Amid the upbeat mood in the crypto sector, investors are looking for options for massive gains. One of the options that has gained mass attention so far is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The project is currently in the presale phase, where it has enjoyed a lot of success. According to analysts, this could be one of the leading projects for explosive growth in 2025, based on the results of the ongoing presale. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in phase 5 of the presale, where tokens are going for $0.03 each. The price is a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. These gradual increases are expected to continue until the final listing price of $0.06. In the upcoming phase 6, the price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. One of the reasons for the massive success of the presale is the expected beta launch of the Mutuum Finance platform on day one of the token listing. This beta launch will boost organic mentions of MUTM tokens and could push the price to new highs. It will boost interest in the project overall and lead to a rush to secure tokens before the live launch of the platform. According to analysts, this could cause the price of MUTM tokens to rise by 4,300%. Based on that forecast, a $1,900 investment in the current phase of the presale could grow to over $81,000. That is a massive return that investors in phase 5 of the presale are keen to secure. With tokens currently available at a 50% discount, this presents the best time to get your tokens. CertiK Partnership The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team is highly focused on the security of its protocol. In line with efforts to ensure the best security possible, the team submitted the code for a CertiK audit. They passed the audit, and they have a token Scan Score of 95 on CertiK. On top of the audit, the team has sought to partner with CertiK to ensure the continuous security of the protocol, long after it goes live. This partnership has taken the form of a Bug Bounty Program. The program will have a $50,000 pot set aside to reward bug hunters. To ensure fairness, the program has been split into four tiers of severity. These are critical, major, minor, and low, with those that identify the most critical vulnerabilities getting the rewards. By adding CertiK as a key partner in the development and maintenance of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ecosystem, it will boost trust in MUTM tokens. Additionally, it will serve to reassure potential protocol users that it is safe. These factors combined could make Mutuum Finance (MUTM) one of the biggest DeFi platforms by user numbers when it goes live. Details Of The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Protocol Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a DeFi protocol where users can participate as lenders, liquidators, or borrowers. The lenders deposit their assets into the protocol’s liquidity pool and earn interest, while borrowers can obtain loans by depositing overcollateralized collateral. The level of overcollateralization is determined by protocol parameters, chief amongst them the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. Each asset accepted for use on the protocol is assigned its own unique LTV, based on factors that include its liquidity and volatility. The more volatile an asset is, for example, the more conservative an LTV it will be assigned. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ecosystem does not require individual loan matching. Instead, it is based on collective pools with the associated borrowings and collateral. Interest rates on the protocol for both borrowers and lenders are determined automatically by market conditions. When there is a high proportion of funds being actively borrowed in a pool, the interest rate goes up. This process ensures that there is optimal capital efficiency. To ensure that liquidity on the protocol is protected, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team has placed various safeguards in place. These include address screening and asset screening. When it comes to address screening, the project will rely on a third-party service, which will check all addresses before they join the protocol. In terms of asset screening, various checks will be performed. They include checking the validity of a token’s price oracle, its centralization, volatility, and liquidity. The checks will be performed on listed assets as well, and if they fall below safe levels, a token may be delisted, or its use paused until the issue can be investigated. Conclusion Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the most exciting crypto projects of 2025.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, the crypto analytics firm Bitcoin Vector tells its audience that liquidity cautiously returning to the top crypto asset by market cap is a sign of an upcoming bull market. “The signal we’ve been waiting for: Bitcoin liquidity has shown its first meaningful expansion in June after reaching a three-year low. With BTC consolidating below its ATH, liquidity supports any sustained upside. While not a breakout, it’s a constructive shift. Capital is cautiously returning, laying the groundwork for the next leg.” Source: Bitcoin Vector/X According to the crypto intelligence firm, BTC is displaying a pattern that has historically led to gains. “Structure shift + price momentum: a duo we want to see. A potential Bitcoin leg up begins with this setup: Bullish momentum + structure shift confirmation (highlighted in blue). We just triggered the same pattern again. This setup historically leads to strong upside.” Source: Bitcoin Vector/X Bitcoin Vector goes on to note that the crypto king has been outperforming Ethereum ( ETH ) – the second-largest digital asset by trading volume – over the last year, meaning that ETH is now “undervalued and under-owned” and in “catch-up mode.” “Over the past year, BTC outperformed ETH massively: BTC rose +74% while ETH fell -28% But that strength has come at a cost BTC’s dominance is stretched, while ETH is now under-owned, undervalued, and in catch-up mode. Rotation season is near.” Source: Bitcoin Vector/X Bitcoin is trading for $107,140 at time of writing, while Ethereum is valued at $2,434, both marginal increases on the day.

2025-06-27T19:53:37,"Euro Stablecoin Market Nears $500M, Outpaces Dollar’s Growth","The euro-denominated stablecoin market is tearing higher in 2025, climbing almost 30% to near a $500 million mark and outperforming the expansion of dollar-backed competition on a percentage basis. This rally is being fueled by a convergence of macroeconomic forces, regulatory certainty, and a rising euro, laying the groundwork for the euro to take on the dollar's dominance in the digital asset ecosystem. Strength of Euro and Contrasting Monetary Policy Drive Demand The euro has appreciated by a whopping 12.88% against the U.S. dollar year to date, reaching its highest since 2021. A lot of this currency appreciation is due to the aggressive tightening by the European Central Bank (ECB) compared to the more relaxed approach of the Federal Reserve in the face of sustained fears of inflation. The result? Investors and institutions alike are being forced to seek alternatives to the U.S. dollar, driving demand for euro-backed digital assets and stablecoins. Market watchers say the move is part of a broader ”Sell America” trend as money flows out of U.S. assets and into Bitcoin, the euro, and gold. Top macro strategist Jens Nordvig cites rising demand for BTC and EUR call options as a sign that investors are protecting themselves against USD volatility and going long on the euro's ongoing strength. This macroclimate has laid rich soil for euro-denominated stablecoins, which are being used more and more as a store of value and transactional currency in DeFi and cross-border payments. EURC Pioneers the Way: Historic Growth and Multi-Chain Growth Circle's EURC stablecoin paces the way, with supply increasing 138% to over $200 million in market value during the first half of 2025. EURC has become the largest euro stablecoin, getting picked up quickly on Ethereum, Solana, and Base. On-chain activity is taking off: active accounts for EURC are up 66% to 22,000, and monthly transfer volume has grown 47% to over $2.5 billion. While still overshadowed by USDC and USDT, EURC's activity is forthcoming—especially since euro stablecoins have now begun to represent an expanding share of the $230 billion global stablecoin market. Other euro-backed tokens, such as Stasis EURS and Tether's EURT, are also picking up once more, but Circle's regulatory alignment and MiCA compliance made EURC the go-to token for institutions and DeFi protocols. EURC is already heavily adopted on lending platforms like Aave, DEXs like Uniswap and Curve, and as collateral for new euro-denominated DeFi products. MiCA Rules The Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) rule by the European Union is a key stimulant for euro stablecoin growth. MiCA has stringent standards for issuer licensing, transparency, and reserves, guaranteeing investors that euro-denominated tokens are secure and in line. The European Commission is expected to affirm stablecoins created outside the EU will be treated as equivalent to the licensed ones in the EU, also opening doors to global adoption. While the ECB has warned that stablecoins pose a threat to traditional banks during stress conditions, markets embrace MiCA's ease. Euro stablecoins are therefore becoming more seen as a regulated, safe haven for retail and institutional buyers alike—especially with euro-denominated DeFi rails expanding and an increasing number of protocols backing EURC and its cousins. Can the Euro Be Crypto's Second Reserve? While they are increasing rapidly, euro stablecoins are still below 1% of all stablecoins worldwide, light-years behind USD-backed giants. But with the revival of the euro, MiCA regulatory clarity, and increasing demand for non-dollar-denominated assets, the time is now right for the euro to become crypto's second reserve currency. Market observers expect more innovation in euro-denominated DeFi, payments, and cross-border settlements with EURC and its rivals poised to take a larger slice of the digital money economy. Bottom Line The meteoric surge of the euro stablecoin market to $500 million is more than a news ticker headline—it's a harbinger of new global finance. With MiCA regulations kicking in and the euro growing in strength, euro-backed stablecoins are becoming increasingly popular as a solid contender to the dollar, poised to reshape the future of digital money and DeFi in Europe and beyond.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9738/euro-stablecoin-market-nears-500-m-outpaces-dollar-s-growth,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|USDT","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-06-27T19:50:25,"Bitcoin long-term holders added 800,000 BTC in a month, the highest ever recorded","Bitcoin long-term holders just locked in the biggest single-month accumulation ever recorded, grabbing 800,000 BTC in the span of 30 days, according to CryptoQuant. That figure is the highest monthly net growth in coins sitting untouched for more than six months, meaning they’ve now officially crossed into Long-Term Holder (LTH) status. And it’s not some bear-market bargain hunting either. These coins were bought when Bitcoin was trading between $95,000 and $107,000, with spot prices still holding above $100,000 today. The term “LTH” can get tricky. It’s not about addresses, it’s about the coin age. The moment a coin stays put for over 180 days, it’s categorized as long-term. So this isn’t just whales parking coins. It’s about how long those coins sit there, untouched. What we’re seeing now is a kind of quiet lock-in, with investors holding harder than they ever have before. This exact kind of accumulation spike has only shown up six times in Bitcoin’s 15-year history. ETFs and dolphins buy as megawhales back off Since May 9, Bitcoin has barely moved, sticking to a $10,000 range, even with a brief jump near $112,000, just above its previous high. That rally didn’t last. And it wasn’t for lack of interest. Over the last month, Bitcoin ETFs pulled in $3.5 billion across 12 straight trading sessions, making it their ninth week of inflows out of the last 11. But while the ETFs were stacking, the price barely moved. Why? Markus Thielen, head of 10x Research, explained it bluntly: “There is this change of ownership happening. We are not seeing a lot of real demand right now because the demand has been almost perfectly offset by the selling from these larger wallets.” In other words, the big early holders — the megawhales — are selling. But they’re doing it slowly, waiting for institutions like ETFs and corporate treasuries to absorb the supply. Julio Moreno, CryptoQuant’s research chief, said the real power buyers this year are wallets holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC, a group CryptoQuant calls dolphins. ETFs likely fall into that bracket. These aren’t retail investors or megawhales. They’re institutions spreading coins across many wallets. BlackRock, for example, operates around 550 wallets, averaging 1,290 BTC each. Strategy — the firm formerly known as MicroStrategy — controls 490 wallets, averaging 927 BTC each, based on 10x Research’s breakdown. Despite looking like mid-sized holders, these companies have stacked thousands of Bitcoin through their network of smaller wallets. Julio said, “In reality, these entities are in fact large holders, having purchased thousands of Bitcoin.” Chinese miners sit on five million coins as whales manage exit Meanwhile, the biggest Bitcoin holders ever, the early Chinese mining operations, are still in the picture. Between 2013 and 2021, China controlled up to 75% of the global hashrate, creating as much as 15 million BTC. Today, they still sit on at least five million of those coins. In every previous bull run, those dormant wallets would start dumping onto exchanges. Not this time. Thielen pointed out that these older wallets are only letting go of what ETFs and companies like Strategy are ready to take. “This time, so far, it seems that these wallets are holding – holding tight and only releasing as many Bitcoins as can be scooped up by ETFs and by Strategy,” he said. Still, not everyone’s buying like they were in 2024. Strategy has slowed its acquisition pace, thanks to tighter stock premiums and more competition from other companies moving Bitcoin onto their balance sheets. They’re still the biggest public buyer, but they’re not pushing as hard right now. The whale cohorts — wallets holding 1,000 to 10,000 BTC — and the megawhales holding more than that, have been net sellers in 2025. Retail wallets, those with less than 1 BTC, are also offloading. But as long as the dolphins keep buying faster than the whales sell, the market holds steady. If that flips, things stall out. “The imbalance creates a slight bearish bias,” Thielen said. “Making a breakout unlikely without a clear shift in our tactical flow indicator. Until that signal improves, consolidation is expected to continue.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

2025-06-27T19:43:09,"Bitcoin Bull Michael Saylor’s Company Strategy Hit with Multiple Lawsuits – Here’s the Critical Date","Bitcoin-focused investment firm Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) is facing at least five separate class-action lawsuits over $6 billion in unrealized Bitcoin losses, alleging the company made misleading statements to investors about the risks and profitability of Bitcoin. The initial lawsuit was filed by Pomerantz LLP on May 16. However, four other law firms — Gross Law Firm, Bronstein Gewirtz & Grossman, Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check and Levi & Korsinsky — have opted to file separate lawsuits with similar content rather than join the lawsuit. That’s not unusual, legal experts say. “In class-action securities litigation, law firms compete for the lead counsel role because that role can be very lucrative, with fees in the tens of millions of dollars,” said Adam Pritchard, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School. Related News: BREAKING: Donald Trump Comments on Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies Each of the lawsuits alleges that the company made “materially false and misleading” statements about the profitability and risks of Bitcoin investments between April 30, 2024 and April 4, 2025. Professor Ann Lipton of the University of Colorado School of Law similarly emphasized the importance of the lead plaintiff position, saying, “The lead plaintiff controls the litigation and determines the class attorneys. In cases that appear to be strong, many firms and plaintiffs file lawsuits to try their luck.” Law firms looking to get ahead in the litigation process are issuing public press releases inviting more investors to join the case. These statements often draw attention to the July 15 deadline, when the court will choose a lead plaintiff and the other cases will be consolidated under that umbrella. The primary goal of law firms, Pritchard says, is to include the most harmed investor among their plaintiffs. The Securities Private Litigation Reform Act of 1995 requires that the lead plaintiff role be given to the investor who suffered the most harm and volunteered to take on that role. Lipton sums it up this way: “An investor who has had more losses will monitor the case and the lawyers more carefully. That’s why institutional investors are generally preferred.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-27T19:40:03,"Staked Ether exceeds 30% of ETH total supply","Ethereum (ETH) is facing a mix of relatively low prices and increased usage. The network is carrying a near-record level of transactions, while over 30% of the supply is locked. Ethereum (ETH) keeps building up a supply crunch, based on whale holdings and increased staking. Currently, around 30% of the supply is staked, with highly active inflows in the past few months. More than 35M ETH is staked on the Beacon chain, an all-time high. The trend for staking may continue, as ETFs are also allowed to include staking for passive income. ETH staking picked up again in Q2, leading to a record value locked of over 35M ETH, or around 30% of the available supply. | Source: Beacon Chain After some outflows from the staking contract during the market panic in March and April, Ethereum staking returned to peak levels, not seen since September 2024. ETH staking became one of the most reliable markers for long-term confidence in the network’s value. Following the Pectra upgrade, staking also accelerated as large-scale whales could deposit more ETH at a time to build their stake. As a result, the total value staked on Ethereum is at an all-time high. The Ethereum network carries over $61B locked in DeFi protocols, including lending, liquid staking, and DEX liquidity pools. ETH remains valuable as collateral, and whales are in no hurry to sell. More ETH is wrapped in multiple protocols and is taken off the open market. Whales have also shown increased activity, adding on average 800K ETH per day for the previous week, while only 16K new ETH are produced each week. Whales are showing unprecedented levels of accumulation, boosting the narrative of a long-awaited price breakout. ETH exchange reserves remain scarce, at around 19M tokens. ETFs are also actively buying, with BlackRock recently absorbing the stake sold by Grayscale. ETH is also becoming attractive to corporate buyers as a collateral asset. The Ethereum network also awaits a new upgrade , which could further scale and speed up transactions. Despite the relatively high price compared to other networks, Ethereum remains a key platform for DeFi. Based on smart contract activity, the network’s main use cases are ETH transfers, while USDT and USDC remain some of the busiest smart contracts. ETH remains undervalued with volatile trading The current status of ETH is raising expectations for a catch-up rally. Trading under $2,500, ETH is seen as undervalued, despite the peak on-chain activity. Transactions have been climbing for Ethereum throughout 2025, reaching a higher baseline, with the occasional day of anomalous record activity. Despite this, the ETH market price remains close to its lows, still crashing after each breakout. In June, ETH failed to reclaim the $3,000 level. The token is down around 5% in June, though Q2 may end with significant net gains. ETH expanded by 31.8% in Q2, mostly driven by the peak gains in May. The multiple bullish factors for ETH are still not enough to spark a more decisive rally. In June, there is still an expectation for a breakout, where ETH can rally as high as $10,000. Even without a rally, Ethereum has shown it is not a dead chain. Recently, the network drew in over $334M in daily net inflows from bridges, as value returned to the biggest liquidity hub.

2025-06-27T19:39:41,"Inflation fears push Bolivian small businesses to embrace crypto","Bolivian small businesses are increasingly starting to accept crypto as payment amid the ongoing financial crisis. Small businesses in Bolivia are increasingly embracing crypto as trust in the official currency deteriorates. According to a report by Reuters, restaurants, beauty salons, and a range of small businesses are beginning to accept crypto payments. Amid this rising crypto adoption, transactions are up 530% in the first half of 2025 compared to the same period last year. According to Bolivia’s central bank, crypto transactions rose from $46.5 million to $294 million over the course of the year. The surge in crypto usage comes as the country grapples with a major financial crisis. Bolivia’s currency has lost more than half its value on the black market, while the central bank has run out of dollar reserves. Fuel shortages and historic inflation levels are making crypto assets appear stable in comparison. As a result, Bolivians are increasingly turning to Bitcoin (BTC) and stablecoins like Tether (USDT) to protect their savings and purchasing power. According to Jose Gabriel Espinoza, former head of Bolivia’s central bank, daily USDT volumes in the country may be as high as $600,000. While this is still a small fraction of the $12–$14 million cash-based black market, reliance on crypto is rapidly growing.

2025-06-27T19:20:43,"Core Scientific Could Top $30 on CoreWeave Buyout Deal: Cantor Fitzgerald","In a research note released late Thursday, Cantor Fitzgerald says Core Scientific (CORZ) could fetch over $30 per share in a potential acquisition by cloud compute giant CoreWeave , citing both the long-term cash flows from its AI contracts and the replacement value of its data centers. That would be a near doubling from the current level just above $16. The note came hours after The Wall Street Journal reported that CoreWeave, a cloud AI compute firm, is once again in advanced talks to acquire Core Scientific, following a failed $5.75 per share offer in 2024. CORZ shares jumped 33% to close over $16 Thursday, but Cantor believes that it still undervalues the company by at least 50%. At the heart of the bull case is a 12-year, $3.5 billion infrastructure lease Core Scientific signed with CoreWeave in 2024 to provide 200 megawatts of AI capacity. Cantor values the lease stream at $24/share, using a conservative 15x profit multiple typical for traditional data center REITs. Add another $11.70/share for the replacement value of CORZ’s 570MW of power infrastructure, and the upside case becomes clear. The BTC - AI Pivot But it’s not just Cantor arguing that the compute power used for crunching numbers to mine BTC might be more efficiently used for AI. Rittenhouse Research, a new fintech and AI-focused firm, released a report in May arguing that the most successful crypto companies aren’t doubling down on bitcoin. Instead, they’re pivoting to become AI infrastructure providers. When Galaxy Digital bought the Helios data center in late 2022, it seemed like a rescue of a struggling miner, yet it turned out to be a strategic AI asset as demand for data center space surged with the rise of ChatGPT and LLMs, Rittenhouse pointed out. “The infrastructure used to mine digital gold is better used to process AI algorithms,” Rittenhouse wrote at the time. At the core of the argument is the belief that AI generates stable, long-term cash flows, unlike BTC mining, which is subject to sharp revenue drops every four years due to halvings and is heavily dependent on bitcoin’s volatile price cycles. The future profitability of BTC mining, Rittenhouse noted, is also dependent on mining firms being able to design chips that are significantly more efficient each cycle to account for the halvening, an increasingly difficult task as gains from silicon shrinkage begin to plateau. But Not Every Pivot Away from BTC is Successful While Cantor, and the market broadly, is looking fondly on Core Scientific's possible pivot, not all pivots away from BTC mining have gone this well. As CoinDesk recently reported, Bit Digital is dumping its bitcoin rigs to go all-in on Ethereum staking , and the market pushed down its stock by 15% during the Thursday trading session in New York. Canaan, once hoping to diversify into AI hardware, has now shuttered its chip unit entirely after failing to gain traction. Its stock is down nearly 75% in the last six months, and closed at 63 cents on Thursday. But Core Scientific might have found the middle path, leveraging its mining-built footprint to tap into a $100 billion-plus AI infrastructure boom. If Cantor’s thesis proves right, CoreWeave’s second offer for CORZ could look very different from the one they made last year , and it could mark a new blueprint for the rest of the sector. Neither CoreWeave nor Core Scientific has publicly commented on the matter.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/27/core-scientific-could-top-30-on-coreweave-buyout-deal-cantor-fitzgerald,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin|Mining|Corz|Coreweave|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-27T19:20:27,"Strategy is facing multiple lawsuits over $6B in unrealized Bitcoin losses and alleged investor deception","Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, is facing mounting legal pressure with at least five class-action suits accusing the company of security fraud. The accusations are based on its unrealized losses of $6 billion in its Bitcoin portfolio and accuse the corporation of not sufficiently disclosing risks to investors. According to the plaintiffs, the company issued untrue and misleading statements for 11 months, beginning in April 2024 and lasting until April 2025. The lawsuits allege that Strategy presented the Bitcoin volatility and the effects of the new accounting alteration in a weak manner. Investors contend that the failure to submit these risks led to a significant decline in share price. In the first case to be led by an investor, Abhey Parmar, he claims that the executives of Strategy Inc. had breached fiduciary duties and exaggerated the firm’s financial prospects. One of the main allegations is that CEO Phong Le and CFO Andrew Kang sold 31.5 million worth of the company before publicly announcing the changes in Bitcoin accounting. According to legal experts, this is common in large-scale class actions where law firms will bid to be appointed lead counsel. Stock gains amid legal scrutiny Strategy shares are up 28% year-to-date through all the legal headwinds, signaling continued investor confidence in its Bitcoin accumulation strategy. The firm now has 592,345 BTC worth more than $63 billion. Strategy has an average purchase price of $70,702 per coin, and Bitcoin is trading at $106,824, an unrealized gain of $21.3 billion, roughly a 51% gain. The founder and chairman of Strategy, Michael Saylor, remained the largest individual shareholder. He owns close to 20 million shares as of the last SEC filing, which translates to approximately $7.8 billion using the current stock price of $389.50 per share. Other significant shareholders are Vanguard (8.55%), BlackRock (5.80%), Capital International Investors (5.80%), Susquehanna Securities (4.82%), and Jane Street Group (4.70%). Despite the growing scrutiny, the company has maintained the same long-term approach to Bitcoin, which involves frequent buy-ups no matter the market conditions, and it has new fiscal backing as a result. Strategy shares ( $MSTR ) are trading at $393.24 and have a market cap of $107.51 billion, a premium of 1.67x over its net asset value. Profit warning sparked filing surge The lawsuits continued to gain traction following revelations by Strategy in April that it was expected to report no profit on Q1, attributed to unrealized losses in Bitcoin. The company cautioned in an SEC filing that it “may not be able to regain profitability in future periods.” Strategy recorded a loss of $16.49 per share in Q1. The initial class action was filed on May 16 by Pomerantz LLP, followed by individual actions by Gross Law Firm, Bronstein Gewirtz & Grossman, Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, and Levi & Korsinsky. The possibility of seeing numerous claims instead of a unified lawsuit indicates a clash of legal interests and confusion among the major stakeholders who should take the initiative. So far, none of the top institutional holders of Strategy has attested to participating in any of the suits. The result may shape wider market attitudes toward corporate exposure and disclosure on Bitcoin, especially when insider trading allegations become material.

Bitcoin (BTC) is down 0.7% in the last 24 hours, now trading for $106,700, according to CoinDesk market data. The orange coin’s performance was broadly in line with the CoinDesk 20’s — an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, except for stablecoins, memecoins, and exchange coins — which fell 0.7% in the same period of time. Sui (SUI) was the index’s token that experienced the biggest price change either way, and it only rose 3.3%. Crypto stocks saw more significant moves, with Coinbase (COIN) and Circle (CRCL) losing 6% and 16% respectively. The stablecoin issuer’s stock is down 40% since it topped at almost $300 on Monday. Bitcoin miners remained relatively flat on the day, including Core Scientific (CORZ), which rose more than 30% on Thursday off a report that AI Hyperscaler CoreWeave was looking into acquiring the company, although Hut 8 (HUT) fell 6.5%. The mild price action contrasted with the prospect of the White House’s tariff strategy kicking into high gear again. U.S. President Donald Trump announced that his administration would be terminating all trade discussions with Canada in light of the Digital Services Tax the country aims to impose on U.S. tech firms. “We will let Canada know the Tariff that they will be paying to do business with the United States of America within the next seven-day period,” Trump posted . The pause on reciprocal tariffs is also slated to end on July 9, but neither traditional markets nor crypto seem particularly concerned, Coinbase analysts noted in a research report. “[Markets] have largely disregarded the potential economic risks stemming from this situation… partly because this hasn’t necessarily been reflected in the economic data,” the analysts wrote.

2025-06-27T19:10:17,"XRP Exhibits Strong Bullish Sentiment Despite Ripple-SEC Settlement Snag","New data from blockchain analytics firm Santiment shows that while optimism around Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) has recently cooled, retail sentiment for XRP is overwhelmingly positive. BTC and ETH, the crypto market’s top two cryptocurrencies, have both witnessed a noticeable drop in positive sentiment on social media since late May. Santiment noted that their sentiment ratios, which measure positive against negative commentary, have trended downward. This cooling in social buzz comes amid wild price volatility and downward pressure on both crypto’s prices, suggesting a more cautious stance among investors. Bitcoin is trading at $106,897 at the time of publication, down 2% over the past 30 days. The alpha crypto hit $110,266 around two weeks ago on June 10, before entering a downtrend a day after Israel launched airstrikes on Iran that tanked equities and crypto markets. Meanwhile, Ether recently dipped to $2,429. The crypto has been stuck below the psychologically important $3,000 mark for over 20 weeks following gradual erosion in trader confidence. XRP Sentiment Positive As Judge Slaps Down $50M Settlement Request In sharp contrast, XRP’s bullish-to-bearish comment ratio has climbed 2.1:1 — the highest in roughly 17 days. Santiment analysts pointed out that this spike comes after New York judge Analisa Torres denied a joint request from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple for her to grant a proposed settlement agreement that would reduce Ripple’s civil penalty to $50 million and lift the permanent injunction against the blockchain payments firm. Despite the SEC adopting a more crypto-friendly regulatory posture in recent months under its new leadership, Torres found that the law hasn’t changed. Although Torres’s ruling was a massive legal blow that could prolong the nearly five-year-long case, it seems to have unexpectedly sparked positive discussion and belief among XRP holders. XRP was changing hands around $2.08 on Friday, a 2.4% decrease over the past day.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/xrp-exhibits-strong-bullish-sentiment-despite-ripple-sec-settlement-snag/,"BTC|ETH|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP","Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News",cryptocompare

2025-06-27T19:07:01,"BTCI: $100K Sticky Bitcoin Level May Benefit Option Sellers","Summary BTCI offers high yield by selling Bitcoin options, but these distributions are a return of capital rather than true income and may erode principal over time. BTCI outperforms in flat Bitcoin markets due to its premium income, but underperforms during sharp rallies and carries a similar downside risk to holding Bitcoin directly. I suspect Bitcoin's price may remain range-bound near $100K due to the behavioral and emotional weight of this price level, creating resistance above $110K and support below $90K. Although BTCI is not suitable for long-term income or aggressive bull scenarios, it stands to outperform with a high yield if Bitcoin remains range-bound, as I suspect. Those who follow my research may know that I am skeptical of both Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and derivative-based ETFs. Both have become more popular investments among retail investors seeking low market correlation and high appreciation potential (Bitcoin) and high-income returns (option selling funds). Thus, it is little surprise that Neos Funds has seen strong inflows in its Bitcoin option strategy ETF ( BTCI ), which generates distributions by selling options on Bitcoin. Although cryptocurrencies provide potential and, in a few cases, actual economic utility, I doubt Bitcoin's potential to fulfill its primary role as a medium of exchange . For the time being, it is certainly a store of value for many, but one subject to the speculative whims led, in part, by excess liquidity conditions in the market. Derivative-based ETFs often generate dividend premiums by selling options. While strategy is attractive to many due to its double-digit yields, I believe it is frequently misunderstood as ""income,"" when in fact it is a return of capital, akin to an insurance premium for assuming risk. Given the fund's sharp rise in assets under management since its inception, and the popularity of both option selling and Bitcoin funds, I believe BTCI deserves closer inspection. Although I am generally skeptical of Bitcoin and option selling, BTCI may be an instance where this strategy is sensible, given that speculative demand for Bitcoin long options may be excessive. BTCI Outperforms in Flat Markets On the surface, BTCI has many desirable qualities. Its current distribution rate is around 30%, with a reasonable expense ratio (for a complex fund) of 0.98%. BTCI's total return since its inception late last year is 50%, significantly outperforming most equity funds over the same period, driven by both price appreciation and substantial distribution returns. Since its inception, BTCI's correlation with the S&P 500 ETF ( SPY ) is 0.44, a relatively low figure that still indicates some market exposure. Its correlation to the Bitcoin ETF ( HODL ), which it owns for appreciation, is 0.98. Since its inception, BTCI has underperformed HODL on a total return basis (which accounts for fully reinvested dividends): Data by YCharts As seen in the total return ratio, BTCI underperforms sharply during large rallies in Bitcoin, such as that seen recently and after the election last November. However, BTCI outperformed slightly during the range-bound conditions in the intermediate periods. Two-thirds of BTCI is allocated to T-Bills, resulting in a BTCI SEC Yield of 2.1%, as distributions of option premiums are not considered actual dividends. The reason is that, unlike actual dividends, these premiums will weigh on BTCI's unit price over time. Approximately 25% of BTCI is allocated to the Bitcoin ETF ( HODL ), which may experience minor appreciation potential in the event of a rise in the price of Bitcoin. However, most of its fluctuations come from the small portion of the fund allocated to options on the CBOE Mini Bitcoin Index, MBTX. The index is currently at 255 points, equivalent to a BTC-USD value of approximately $107K. Currently, 9.5% of BTCI is allocated to long calls at 225, providing significant appreciation potential should Bitcoin rise, though this position will be worthless should Bitcoin fall to ~$94K. About 1% of the fund is allocated to call sales at 285 and 270, respectively (about $110K-$120K in BTC terms). It also has a negative put at 225, which is approximately 1% of its holdings. Thus, roughly 2% of the fund is allocated to option sales, generating premium returns of roughly 2% by expiration in mid-July. Based on its allocations, its ratio appears to be four put short positions, two long calls, and two short calls at differing expiries. Because option price data on MBTX is not as readily available as it is on the Bitcoin fund ( GBTC ), I aligned the expiry prices from MBTX with the equivalent prices for GBTC and, using an online tool, created a rough profit payoff chart for this strategy at current GBTC option prices. I assume that implied volatility levels (which drive premiums) are roughly equivalent for GBTC options and MBTX. At the same time, GBTC trades at its NAV , meaning this payoff chart should be almost identical for BTCI based on its current holdings: Option payoff chart for GBTC, July 18th, 2 $75 long calls, 4 $75 short puts,1 $90 short call, and 1 $95 short call (OptionsProfitCalculator.com) Importantly, the total cost of each option position is in the same ratios as BTCI's allocations on its positions, with the same expiry date. Although imperfect, this should be as close as possible to BTCI's actual payoff chart from its current derivative positions. However, it does not include the quarter of the fund allocated to HODL. Accounting for that position would ""tilt"" this chart upward, showing a ~1/4 slope at the left end instead of a plateau. The 2/3rds of the fund in T-bills would very slightly lift the chart by about 30 bps, as that income will come regardless of Bitcoin's price. Fundamentally, this strategy is not significantly different than a simple covered-call approach. However, by selling options at various expiration levels, the payoff is more curved than the usual ""stair step"" seen in simple covered calls. This gives BTCI relatively high appreciation potential, with a roughly 1:1 linear payoff up to a 5% rise in Bitcoin through July 18th. If Bitcoin rises by over 10%, BTCI should increase about 7% to 8%, with more limited gains given a very sharp rise in Bitcoin. Crucially, BTCI should earn about 1% (98 bps) if Bitcoin merely sustains its current price. There is approximately 1/17th of a year between now and July 18th, meaning the annualized return of BTCI would be about 18% annualized, assuming no change in Bitcoin's price or implied volatility levels. BTCI can earn a decent yield in flat markets because Bitcoin is volatile and therefore has high option premiums to account for its added risk. GBTC's implied volatility today is 37% , far higher than seen in equity index funds, but that is one of its lowest implied volatility levels compared to recent months. This means that BTCI's premium compensation may be low compared to the volatility risk associated with Bitcoin. Bitcoin May Face Sustained Plateau Investors who reinvest their distributions back into BTCI can expect total returns that are very similar to those of Bitcoin itself. The primary difference is that BTCI's strategy generates returns in flat markets, albeit not as strong as those in sharp rallies. BTCI's downside risk is roughly the same as that of Bitcoin itself, except for a small premium cushion. That said, if BTCI's distributions are not reinvested, the position's value will inevitably decline compared to the value of Bitcoin. We can see this in the price-return ratio of BTCI to HODL: Data by YCharts Their total returns, accounting for reinvested distributions, are very close; yet, BTCI experiences chronic decay to simply long Bitcoin funds. This decay factor is larger the faster Bitcoin rises, and vice versa. For this reason, it isn't very reasonable to treat BTCI's distributions as income that can be used for personal consumption. Doing so will inevitably lead to the decay of capital over time, assuming Bitcoin does not appreciate forever . Today, Bitcoin is at a key level, aligning with its past peak before the spring correction. Both Bitcoin and gold have been in trading ranges since the May recovery: Data by YCharts Compared to gold, Bitcoin has demonstrated higher market exposure. Although gold faced small losses during the height of the last correction, it generally rose through that period as inflation expectations and concerns mounted. At the same time, Bitcoin's value crashed by around 30%, more than the value of equities. Gold continued to rise as the market recovered. From an inter-asset correlation standpoint, Bitcoin is neither countercyclical nor a hedge against monetary risk. When concerns regarding dovish monetary policies (in a recession) rise, we're generally seeing gold rally and Bitcoin decline. Changes in the liquidity conditions of retail investors likely drive the price change of Bitcoin. When individual investors report having higher cash allocations, and those allocations are declining, we generally see sharp rallies in Bitcoin. When they report having low cash positions, Bitcoin often peaks and declines. See below: Data by YCharts This relationship is not perfect. I have had a bearish sentiment on Bitcoin since late last year due to low investor sideline cash levels; yet, it rose dramatically after Trump's election, primarily due to the view that he would create a Bitcoin reserve. The reality of this plan has disappointed investors , as Trump is not aiming to buy Bitcoin with government funds, but rather is merely creating a named reserve for Bitcoin that the government already owns through civil asset forfeiture. To me, this effort mainly highlights the degree to which Bitcoin is not an asset immune to government oversight and confiscation. Nevertheless, investor cash allocations were higher last month due to a derisking effort following the correction. That may be somewhat supportive of Bitcoin, though it is unclear if cash levels have fallen significantly since, which I assume given the full recovery of most assets. In my view, it is more likely that Bitcoin struggles to break above $110K, given its momentum has slowed. To me, the more likely outcome is continued range-bound behavior around $100K, given that it is an emotionally critical threshold. Bitcoin may also crash again, potentially catalyzed by another market correction due to the upcoming end of delayed tariffs , though recent news suggests the deadline will be delayed yet again . However, considering only Bitcoin's fundamentals, I believe a range-bound outlook is the most reasonable, particularly given that gold is also in a trading range. The Bottom Line If Bitcoin fluctuates around the $90K to $110K range for a prolonged period, BTCI stands to outperform Bitcoin, earning premiums in a flat market. For this reason, I remain neutral on BTCI, but I believe it may have some speculative short-term value in relation to Bitcoin itself. Of course, there's an argument that Bitcoin may see a huge rally if it breaks above $110K. BTCI is likely to underperform in a massive rally and has roughly the same downside risk should the rally reverse. In my opinion, that is unlikely, given the behavioral and emotional importance of $100K, which provides a ""stickiness factor"" that may keep it around this level. A flat Bitcoin price is ideal for BTCI because it will earn high premiums with less volatility if that is sustained.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4797848-btci-100k-sticky-bitcoin-level-may-benefit-option-sellers?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","BTCI",cryptocompare
