2025-06-27T23:50:41,"US Stock Market: Unprecedented Surge as Nasdaq and S&P 500 Hit Record Highs","BitcoinWorld US Stock Market: Unprecedented Surge as Nasdaq and S&P 500 Hit Record Highs For those deeply immersed in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, it’s easy to focus solely on Bitcoin’s latest moves or Ethereum’s upgrades. Yet, the broader financial landscape, particularly the performance of the US Stock Market , often provides crucial context and can even hint at future trends for digital assets. Recently, the traditional markets have been making headlines, not just in the financial news, but across the board, as both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 have soared to new Market All-Time Highs . This isn’t just a win for Wall Street; it’s a signal that resonates throughout the global economy, potentially influencing everything from investor confidence to capital flows into alternative assets like crypto. Understanding the Nasdaq Record High: A Closer Look at Tech’s Triumph The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite has once again proven its mettle, climbing to an impressive 20,219.10, marking a 0.25% increase that solidified its position at an all-time high. This milestone isn’t merely a number; it reflects a powerful narrative of innovation, growth, and the enduring dominance of the tech sector in the global economy. What’s fueling this remarkable Nasdaq Record High ? AI Revolution: The explosive growth in artificial intelligence continues to drive demand for chips, software, and cloud services, directly benefiting tech giants like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Google’s parent company, Alphabet. Corporate Earnings: Many of the Nasdaq’s largest constituents have reported robust earnings, exceeding analyst expectations and demonstrating strong fundamentals even in a challenging economic environment. Investor Confidence: A renewed appetite for growth stocks, fueled by expectations of potential interest rate cuts and a generally optimistic outlook on technological advancements, has channeled significant capital into the sector. Magnificent Seven’s Continued Influence: The so-called ‘Magnificent Seven’ tech titans (Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta, and Tesla) continue to exert immense influence, with their collective performance often dictating the Nasdaq’s trajectory. Their sheer market capitalization and ongoing innovation act as powerful engines for the index. This surge highlights the market’s belief in the long-term potential of technological innovation to drive economic progress and create new value, a sentiment that often spills over into the crypto space, particularly for projects focused on Web3, AI, and decentralized technologies. What Drives the S&P 500 Performance to Uncharted Territory? Not to be outdone, the broader S&P 500 index also ascended to a new peak, rising 0.19% to 6,152.66. As a benchmark for the overall health of the U.S. economy, the S&P 500’s achievement signifies a widespread strength across various sectors, not just technology. The robust S&P 500 Performance is a testament to several interconnected factors: Broad-Based Corporate Earnings: Beyond tech, sectors like financials, industrials, healthcare, and consumer discretionary have shown resilience and growth, contributing to a more diversified market rally. Companies are managing costs effectively and seeing strong consumer demand. Resilient Economy: Despite concerns about inflation and interest rates, the U.S. economy has demonstrated remarkable resilience, with strong employment figures and steady GDP growth. This underlying economic stability provides a solid foundation for corporate profitability. Optimism on Interest Rates: While the Federal Reserve has maintained a hawkish stance, market participants are increasingly optimistic about the prospect of future rate cuts, which would reduce borrowing costs for businesses and potentially boost consumer spending. Share Buybacks and Dividends: Many S&P 500 companies are returning capital to shareholders through aggressive share buyback programs and consistent dividend payouts, which can enhance stock prices and attract investors. The S&P 500’s climb reflects a collective belief in the fundamental strength and adaptability of American corporations. This broad market optimism often sets a positive backdrop for all asset classes, including digital ones. The US Stock Market’s Ascent: A Beacon of Economic Optimism? The simultaneous record highs in both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 paint a picture of profound optimism within the broader US Stock Market . This isn’t just a fleeting moment; it’s a culmination of various economic forces and investor confidence. But what does this mean for the everyday person, and indeed, for those observing the volatile crypto markets? The market’s ascent can be seen as a strong indicator of several underlying economic strengths: Factor Impact on Market Relevance to Broader Economy Strong Corporate Profits Higher valuations, investor confidence Healthy business environment, job creation Consumer Spending Drives revenue for many companies Indicates consumer confidence and economic activity Innovation & Technology New growth avenues, productivity gains Transforms industries, creates future wealth Stable Employment Ensures consistent consumer demand Low unemployment, wage growth While some might point to potential overvaluation or the concentration of gains in a few large companies, the breadth of the S&P 500’s participation suggests a more widespread economic health. This robust traditional market performance can sometimes act as a leading indicator, suggesting a ‘risk-on’ environment where investors are more willing to take on risk across various asset classes. Navigating Market All-Time Highs: Opportunities and Considerations for Investors When major indices hit Market All-Time Highs , it naturally sparks a mix of excitement and apprehension. For long-term investors, these highs can validate their strategies and signify healthy growth. However, it also raises questions about sustainability and potential corrections. It’s a critical juncture where understanding the nuances becomes paramount. Opportunities: Wealth Creation: For those already invested, these highs represent significant portfolio growth and increased net worth. Positive Economic Signal: Sustained market highs often correlate with a robust economy, indicating strong corporate performance and consumer confidence. Momentum Trading: Some traders may find opportunities in continuing upward trends, though this comes with higher risk. Considerations & Challenges: Valuation Concerns: High prices can mean stretched valuations, potentially limiting future upside or increasing vulnerability to negative news. Increased Volatility: Markets at highs can be more susceptible to sharp pullbacks or corrections as investors might be quicker to take profits. Fear of Missing Out (FOMO): The temptation to jump into a rising market can lead to irrational decisions, especially for new investors. Interest Rate Outlook: Future interest rate decisions by central banks could impact corporate borrowing costs and overall market liquidity. For investors, the key is to maintain a balanced perspective, focusing on long-term goals rather than short-term fluctuations. This principle holds true whether you’re navigating traditional stocks or the often more volatile crypto landscape. How Shifting Investor Sentiment in Traditional Markets Impacts Crypto The relationship between traditional financial markets and the burgeoning world of cryptocurrencies is complex and evolving. While often seen as separate, the prevailing Investor Sentiment in the stock market can have a profound, albeit sometimes indirect, impact on digital assets. This connection is primarily observed through ‘risk-on, risk-off’ dynamics and capital flows. The ‘Risk-On, Risk-Off’ Dynamic: When traditional markets like the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are soaring, it often signifies a ‘risk-on’ environment. In such periods, investors generally have a higher appetite for risk, which can lead them to allocate more capital to higher-beta assets, including cryptocurrencies. Conversely, during ‘risk-off’ periods (when traditional markets are declining or volatile), investors tend to seek safer havens, potentially drawing capital away from crypto. Correlation Trends: Historically, Bitcoin, often seen as a proxy for the broader crypto market, has shown periods of correlation with tech stocks (Nasdaq). This is partly because both are considered growth assets, benefiting from abundant liquidity and investor optimism. When tech performs well, crypto often follows, and vice versa. However, there’s also a growing narrative of crypto’s unique value proposition (e.g., decentralization, inflation hedge) allowing it to move independently at times. Institutional Capital Flows: The increasing institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies, especially with the advent of spot Bitcoin ETFs, means that more traditional investors now have direct exposure to crypto. As these large institutions manage their broader portfolios, their sentiment towards the overall market can influence their crypto allocations. A buoyant stock market might make them more comfortable diversifying into digital assets. Macroeconomic Factors: Factors like inflation, interest rates, and global economic growth affect both traditional and crypto markets. For instance, if inflation concerns ease, it might lead to a more accommodative monetary policy, benefiting both stocks and crypto by increasing liquidity. Understanding these interconnections is crucial for crypto investors, as it provides a broader context for market movements beyond just crypto-specific news. Actionable Insights for the Savvy Crypto Investor Given the current landscape where traditional markets are reaching unprecedented highs, what should a discerning crypto investor consider? It’s not about abandoning one for the other, but about understanding the symphony of global finance. Stay Informed, Broadly: Don’t just follow crypto news. Keep an eye on macroeconomic indicators, central bank policies, and the performance of major stock indices. These broader trends can often signal shifts in investor appetite for risk, which directly impacts crypto. Diversify Wisely: While crypto offers immense potential, a well-rounded portfolio might include exposure to both traditional assets and digital ones. Consider how your crypto holdings fit into your overall financial strategy. Understand Correlation vs. Causation: Just because crypto moves with stocks doesn’t mean stocks are directly causing crypto’s moves, or vice versa. Both might be reacting to underlying macro factors. Focus on fundamentals for your chosen crypto assets. Manage Risk: All-time highs in any market can induce FOMO. Avoid making impulsive decisions. Stick to your investment thesis, use dollar-cost averaging, and set clear risk management parameters. Don’t overextend yourself based on exuberance in traditional markets. Long-Term Vision: Both traditional markets and crypto experience cycles. While current highs are exciting, maintaining a long-term perspective can help you weather inevitable corrections and capitalize on sustained growth. Focus on projects with strong utility, development, and community. By integrating insights from the traditional financial world with a deep understanding of the crypto space, you can make more informed decisions and navigate the evolving market landscape with greater confidence. Conclusion: Riding the Waves of Financial Evolution The recent ascent of the Nasdaq and S&P 500 to Market All-Time Highs is a powerful testament to the resilience and growth potential of the US Stock Market . These milestones reflect robust corporate earnings, strong economic indicators, and a prevailing sense of optimism among investors. While the crypto market often dances to its own beat, it is undeniably part of this larger financial ecosystem. The prevailing Investor Sentiment , whether driven by tech triumphs on the Nasdaq or broad economic strength reflected in the S&P 500 Performance, can create ripples that reach every corner of the investment world, including digital assets. For crypto enthusiasts, these traditional market highs offer valuable context. They signal a ‘risk-on’ environment that can foster capital inflows into more speculative assets, yet they also underscore the importance of diversification and prudent risk management. As we move forward, the interplay between these two seemingly distinct worlds will only grow more intricate, demanding a holistic understanding from all investors. By staying informed, adapting strategies, and maintaining a long-term perspective, you can confidently navigate the exciting, interconnected future of finance.

The digital asset platform, backed by Intercontinental Exchange, outlined in its Form S-3 filing that it could issue common and preferred stock, debt instruments, warrants, or bundled securities depending on market conditions. Bakkt’s Bitcoin Treasury Strategy While Bakkt has yet to acquire Bitcoin, the filing aligns with a recent update to its investment policy, allowing the firm to allocate capital toward BTC and other digital assets under its broader treasury strategy. The company stated the timing and scale of any potential crypto purchases would be influenced by several factors, such as capital market receptivity, operational performance, and strategic factors. The filing also acknowledges Bakkt’s history of operating losses and limited track record, and notes that it has identified factors that cast doubt on its ability to continue as a going concern, making the flexibility to tap into capital markets critical for the firm’s operational plans. The $1 billion shelf registration would allow Bakkt to access funds swiftly if market conditions turn favorable, and provide optionality for the company amid its ongoing efforts to stabilize its financial footing while seeking opportunities in digital assets. Bakkt On Crypto IPO Wave The latest effort to secure capital and explore Bitcoin purchases comes as momentum builds in the crypto sector, which is evidenced by new IPO activity from firms like Circle and eToro, along with Gemini’s recent filing . The NYSE-listed firm said that these milestones are “fostering a new kind of public participation in technology that’s reshaping the future of finance.” It went on to add, “At Bakkt, we know what it means to run a public company in this space. These developments bring validation, visibility, and maturity to the market – but they also raise the bar for resilience, compliance, and transparency. That magnifies the importance of infrastructure.” The post $1 Billion Filing by Bakkt Hints at Bitcoin Treasury Ambitions appeared first on CryptoPotato .",cryptopotato,https://cryptopotato.com/1-billion-filing-by-bakkt-hints-at-bitcoin-treasury-ambitions/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION","AA News|BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|Bakkt|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-06-27T23:40:06,"Bitcoin’s Astonishing Evolution: IBIT Volatility Now Mirrors S&P 500","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Astonishing Evolution: IBIT Volatility Now Mirrors S&P 500 Remember when Bitcoin was synonymous with wild price swings, a rollercoaster ride reserved only for the bravest of investors? For years, its notorious volatility kept many traditional finance players on the sidelines. Well, buckle up, because the narrative is rapidly changing, and a recent report has just dropped a bombshell that could redefine Bitcoin’s place in the investment world. We’re talking about a monumental shift in IBIT volatility , signaling a new era for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. What’s Behind This Stunning Shift in IBIT Volatility? The news comes from Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, who recently shared a remarkable observation on X. He reported that the 60-day volatility of BlackRock’s IBIT ETF, which tracks Bitcoin, has plummeted. Just a year ago, IBIT’s volatility was an astounding 5.7 times higher than that of the S&P 500. Today? It has declined to just above parity, meaning IBIT volatility is now nearly matching that of the U.S. stock market. This isn’t just a minor adjustment; it’s a profound transformation. For context, imagine a high-performance sports car that was once notoriously difficult to handle suddenly becoming as smooth and predictable as a family sedan on the highway. This dramatic reduction in volatility for a Bitcoin-backed product like IBIT sends a powerful message to the financial world. It suggests that Bitcoin, through the lens of a regulated ETF, is shedding its ‘wild west’ image and embracing a new level of maturity. Why Does Bitcoin Volatility Matter for Your Portfolio? For a long time, the significant Bitcoin volatility was both its allure and its deterrent. Traders loved the rapid price movements, offering opportunities for quick gains. However, for long-term investors, especially institutional ones, such unpredictability was a major hurdle. Pension funds, endowments, and sovereign wealth funds prioritize stability and predictable returns. High volatility means higher risk, which often translates to strict allocation limits or outright exclusion from traditional portfolios. The decline in Bitcoin volatility is a game-changer because it addresses this core concern. When an asset becomes less volatile, it becomes more attractive to a broader spectrum of investors who are risk-averse or operate under strict investment mandates. This shift is not just about price swings; it’s about the asset’s perceived risk profile and its potential to be a stable component of a diversified portfolio rather than just a speculative bet. Is Bitcoin Now Truly a Peer to the S&P 500? The comparison to the S&P 500 is particularly significant. The S&P 500 is widely regarded as the benchmark for the U.S. stock market and a proxy for the overall health of the economy. It represents a basket of 500 large U.S. companies, known for their relative stability and consistent performance over the long term. For Bitcoin’s volatility to approach that of the S&P 500 means it’s no longer just an outlier; it’s starting to behave like a mature financial asset. What does this mean in practical terms? It implies that the risk-reward profile of Bitcoin, particularly when accessed via a regulated vehicle like IBIT, is becoming comparable to established equities. This convergence could fundamentally alter how financial advisors and portfolio managers view cryptocurrency. It moves Bitcoin from the ‘alternative, high-risk’ bucket into a potentially more integrated role within traditional asset allocation models. This evolution is crucial for broader acceptance and integration into mainstream finance. Unlocking New Horizons: The Promise of Institutional Adoption The sharp drop in IBIT volatility is a monumental step towards accelerated institutional adoption . Institutions, by their nature, are conservative. They require regulatory clarity, robust infrastructure, and, critically, manageable risk profiles. While Bitcoin ETFs have provided the regulatory clarity and infrastructure, the persistent volatility remained a sticking point. Now, with volatility mirroring the S&P 500, a major barrier has been lowered. Consider the benefits for institutional investors: Diversification: Bitcoin still offers a low correlation with traditional assets, meaning it can provide true diversification benefits to a portfolio, especially if its volatility is contained. Accessibility: ETFs like IBIT provide a familiar, regulated wrapper, making it easy for institutions to gain exposure without directly managing digital assets. Risk Management: Reduced volatility makes risk assessment and management much simpler, aligning Bitcoin more closely with existing institutional frameworks. This development could unleash a new wave of capital into the crypto space. We’re talking about pension funds, university endowments, corporate treasuries, and wealth management firms, all of whom have been watching from the sidelines, waiting for the right conditions. The reduction in volatility, combined with the ease of access through ETFs, makes a compelling case for including Bitcoin in their portfolios, marking a pivotal moment for institutional adoption . What Does This Stability Mean for the Broader Crypto Market? The implications of Bitcoin’s newfound stability extend far beyond just IBIT or Bitcoin itself. This increased crypto market stability , spearheaded by Bitcoin’s maturation, could have a ripple effect across the entire digital asset ecosystem. As the dominant cryptocurrency, Bitcoin often sets the tone for the rest of the market. A more stable Bitcoin could lead to: Reduced Altcoin Volatility: While altcoins will likely remain more volatile than Bitcoin, a stable BTC could provide a more solid foundation, potentially leading to less extreme swings in the broader market. Increased Investor Confidence: A less volatile market attracts more cautious investors, fostering an environment of sustained growth rather than boom-and-bust cycles. Enhanced Regulatory Comfort: Regulators often view high volatility as a sign of an immature or risky market. Bitcoin’s stability could encourage more favorable regulatory frameworks globally. Innovation and Utility Focus: With less focus on price speculation, the industry can pivot more towards developing real-world applications, utility, and infrastructure, attracting talent and investment focused on long-term value. This doesn’t mean the crypto market will become boring. Innovation will continue at a rapid pace. However, the underlying asset that anchors the market – Bitcoin – is showing signs of becoming a more reliable and predictable investment vehicle, which is essential for achieving true crypto market stability and mainstream acceptance. Conclusion: Bitcoin’s Remarkable Journey Towards Maturity The journey of Bitcoin from a niche digital experiment to a globally recognized asset has been nothing short of extraordinary. The latest data on IBIT’s volatility, indicating its near parity with the S&P 500, marks a significant milestone in this evolution. It signals a new chapter where Bitcoin is increasingly seen not just as a speculative gamble, but as a legitimate, maturing financial asset capable of fitting into traditional investment portfolios. This profound shift in Bitcoin volatility perception is a testament to the market’s maturation, the impact of institutional-grade products like BlackRock’s IBIT ETF, and the growing understanding of digital assets. For investors, both retail and institutional, this offers a compelling reason to re-evaluate Bitcoin’s role in their financial strategies. The future of finance is undoubtedly embracing digital assets, and Bitcoin’s journey towards stability is paving the way for a more integrated and accessible crypto future.

2025-06-27T23:20:58,"Bitcoin: 10x Research Unveils Critical Coinbase Overvaluation Warning","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin: 10x Research Unveils Critical Coinbase Overvaluation Warning In the fast-paced and often unpredictable world of cryptocurrency, identifying profitable strategies and avoiding pitfalls is paramount. As market sentiment shifts rapidly, investors constantly seek reliable insights to navigate the digital asset landscape. Recently, a prominent voice in crypto research, 10x Research, has made a compelling and somewhat controversial call that has caught the attention of the entire market: a bold pair trade recommending a long position on Bitcoin coupled with a short position on Coinbase (COIN). This isn’t just a casual tip; it’s a strategic warning rooted in a deep digital asset analysis of current market dynamics and valuations. But why this specific recommendation, and what does it signal for your crypto portfolio? Understanding the Bold Crypto Trading Strategy from 10x Research At its core, 10x Research’s recommendation is a classic “pair trade” – a market-neutral crypto trading strategy designed to profit from the relative performance of two correlated assets, rather than their absolute price movements. In this scenario, you bet on Bitcoin outperforming Coinbase . The logic is simple yet profound: if Coinbase shares are indeed overvalued relative to the underlying crypto market, and Bitcoin continues its fundamental ascent, this strategy could yield significant returns regardless of broader market swings. This approach seeks to mitigate overall market risk by simultaneously holding a long and a short position. It’s a sophisticated maneuver, typically employed by institutional investors, but its underlying rationale provides crucial insights for every crypto enthusiast. Long Bitcoin: The belief that Bitcoin, as the flagship cryptocurrency, will continue to grow in value due to adoption, halving events, and its role as a digital gold. Short Coinbase: The expectation that Coinbase’s stock price, despite recent rallies, is inflated and due for a correction, perhaps because its growth isn’t justified by its current business fundamentals. The Relative Play: The trade isn’t about Bitcoin going up or Coinbase going down in isolation, but rather Bitcoin performing better than Coinbase. The Alarming Coinbase Market Valuation: Is a Correction Looming? The crux of 10x Research’s bearish stance on Coinbase centers on its staggering market valuation . The report highlights that COIN shares have experienced an impressive 84% rally in just two months. While such a surge might typically be celebrated, 10x Research warns that this rapid ascent appears increasingly disconnected from Coinbase ’s fundamental business metrics. The core issue? Trading volumes, the lifeblood of any exchange, have not kept pace with the stock’s parabolic rise. This divergence suggests that the recent gains in COIN are less about robust operational performance and more about speculative fervor or broader market exuberance. Consider these points regarding Coinbase’s current standing: Metric Coinbase (COIN) Status Implication Recent Stock Rally +84% in two months Significant short-term gains, potentially overheated. Trading Volume Not keeping pace with stock price Lack of fundamental justification for stock growth. Correlation to Bitcoin Price Disconnected from recent Bitcoin movements Suggests speculative rather than organic growth. Market Activity Overall market activity doesn’t justify rally Increased risk of a significant price correction. When a company’s stock price surges without a corresponding increase in its core business activities, it often signals that the stock is trading above its intrinsic value. This can make it vulnerable to sharp pullbacks, especially if broader market sentiment shifts or if investors begin to scrutinize fundamentals more closely. For Coinbase , a correction could mean a significant re-evaluation of its shares, bringing its price more in line with its actual trading volumes and market share. Bitcoin’s Enduring Strength and In-depth Digital Asset Analysis While 10x Research points to potential weakness in Coinbase , their confidence in Bitcoin remains steadfast. This is crucial for the “long” side of the pair trade. Bitcoin , the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market valuation , continues to solidify its position as a global digital store of value, often dubbed “digital gold.” Its decentralized nature, finite supply, and growing institutional adoption underpin its long-term appeal. Unlike a centralized exchange like Coinbase , Bitcoin’s value is derived from its network effects, security, and increasing utility as a global, permissionless financial rail. A comprehensive digital asset analysis reveals several factors contributing to Bitcoin’s robust outlook: Halving Events: The periodic reduction in new Bitcoin supply, historically a bullish catalyst. Institutional Inflows: Growing interest and investment from large financial institutions, including spot Bitcoin ETFs, legitimizing the asset class. Macroeconomic Hedging: Bitcoin’s perceived role as a hedge against inflation and traditional financial system instability. Network Security: The unparalleled computational power securing the Bitcoin blockchain, making it highly resilient. This stark contrast between Bitcoin’s fundamental strength and Coinbase’s potentially inflated stock price forms the bedrock of 10x Research’s recommendation. They see Bitcoin as the resilient asset, poised for continued growth, while Coinbase , despite its critical role in the ecosystem, faces challenges in justifying its current premium. Actionable Insights: Navigating Your Investment Strategy in a Shifting Landscape For investors, 10x Research’s insights offer a valuable perspective on current crypto market dynamics and potential shifts in market valuation . While a pair trade of long Bitcoin and short Coinbase might be complex for individual retail investors due to the mechanics of shorting, the underlying analysis provides critical takeaways for any investment strategy . Here are some actionable insights: Scrutinize Fundamentals: Don’t just chase rallies. Always look beyond price action to underlying business fundamentals, especially for crypto-related stocks like Coinbase . Are trading volumes, user growth, and revenue streams truly supporting the stock’s performance? Diversify Your Portfolio: While Bitcoin may be a strong long-term play, relying solely on one asset, or one type of asset (like exchange stocks), can be risky. A diversified portfolio can help mitigate the impact of unexpected corrections. Understand Relative Value: The 10x Research call emphasizes relative value. Even if the entire crypto market sees a downturn, an asset that is fundamentally stronger (like Bitcoin ) might still outperform one that is overvalued (like Coinbase shares). Stay Informed on Digital Asset Analysis: Regularly consult reputable research firms and market analysts. Their insights, even if you don’t directly replicate their trades, can inform your own decisions and help you identify potential risks and opportunities. Consider Your Risk Tolerance: Shorting stocks carries unlimited risk and is not suitable for all investors. If you’re not comfortable with complex strategies, focus on the “long” side of the analysis – strengthening your conviction in fundamentally sound assets like Bitcoin . The challenge lies in the inherent volatility of the crypto market. While expert analysis provides a roadmap, unexpected news, regulatory changes, or broader economic shifts can quickly alter market trajectories. Therefore, continuous monitoring and adaptability are key components of a successful crypto trading strategy . Conclusion: A Critical Juncture for Crypto Investors 10x Research’s recommendation to go long Bitcoin and short Coinbase serves as a potent reminder of the importance of fundamental analysis in the often-euphoric crypto market. It underscores a critical divergence: the enduring strength and fundamental value proposition of decentralized digital assets like Bitcoin versus the potential overextension of centralized entities like exchanges whose stock prices may outpace their operational realities. As the crypto landscape matures, discerning between genuine growth and speculative bubbles becomes ever more crucial. Whether you choose to implement a sophisticated pair trade or simply re-evaluate your long-term holdings, 10x Research’s bold call provides an invaluable lens through which to view the current state of market valuation and refine your investment strategy for the road ahead. Staying ahead requires not just riding the waves, but understanding the underlying currents through diligent digital asset analysis .

The inclusion of XRP in BlackRock’s formal documentation signals that the stakes of this lawsuit extend far beyond Ripple. BlackRock Cites Ripple Case in SEC Filing BlackRock’s filing warned that if any regulatory body or court were to classify Bitcoin as a security, it could cause an “immediate material adverse impact” on both the price of Bitcoin and spot Bitcoin ETF shares.

The firm’s decision to single out the Ripple case underscores its importance as a regulatory bellwether for the entire digital asset ecosystem. SMQKE Highlights Institutional Interest This growing institutional interest was echoed by popular crypto commentator SMQKE, who posted on X: “Remember, BlackRock is paying close attention to the Ripple v.

A favorable resolution in the SEC lawsuit would not only affirm XRP’s non-security status but also remove a major obstacle to enterprise and government adoption in key financial markets. Judge Analisa Torres recently denied the initial joint motion to settle the case on procedural grounds, not on its merits. A revised filing is expected soon, and legal analysts widely anticipate that a final resolution could arrive by Q3 2025. For BlackRock to reference the case in its Bitcoin ETF filing suggests that institutional finance is watching the outcome closely and preparing to act. XRP Price Outlook Remains Resilient Despite the legal overhang, XRP is currently trading around $1.98, consolidating just below the $2 psychological level. Analysts note consistent accumulation and signs of bullish divergence on the daily chart, with upside potential building as the lawsuit nears its conclusion. If Ripple secures a favorable outcome, XRP could see a rapid breakout, potentially revisiting its all-time high of $3.84 and setting the stage for new record highs. BlackRock’s explicit reference to the Ripple case confirms what many in the crypto space have long suspected: the outcome of this lawsuit is not just about Ripple, it’s about the future of digital assets in regulated finance. With institutional players like BlackRock closely monitoring developments and voices like SMQKE linking the case to central bank adoption, XRP’s path forward may be clearer than ever, once the legal fog lifts.

2025-06-27T23:00:32,"Fading Spot Volumes And Muted Futures Sentiment Threaten To Send Bitcoin Below $99,000 Again","Bitcoin returned to its familiar price range over the week after a dip last weekend brought its price to just under $99,000. This was followed by a bounce to the $106,000 price level, which has given bulls a reason to remain hopeful. However, on-chain data shows some deeper cracks are forming beneath the surface. The latest on-chain data from analytics firm Glassnode shows growing signs of fatigue in both spot and futures markets. These are conditions that may again cause Bitcoin price to retest $99,000. Price Support Holds, But Momentum is Clearly Fading Bitcoin has gone through multiple price swings in recent days, but it has found its way back to the narrow $100,000 to $110,000 band that has defined market structure since early May. On-chain data from Glassnode shows that strong accumulation between $93,000 and $100,000, which is visible on the Cumulative Volume Delta (CBD) Heatmap, has so far served as a buffer zone that helped Bitcoin’s prices bounce during the most recent geopolitical volatility. However, market volume indicates that this structural support may soon face additional pressure. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Top In? Bitcoin MVRV-Score Has The Answer According to the latest weekly report by Glassnode, investor profitability and engagement surrounding Bitcoin are cooling rapidly. Specifically, a third major wave of profit-taking is causing the 30-day realized profit average to taper, and on-chain activity has decreased significantly. The 7-day moving average of on-chain transfer volume has dropped by about 32%, from a peak of $76 billion in late May to $52 billion over the recent weekend. Current spot volume trading, which is now at just $7.7 billion, is far below the volumes seen during previous rallies. The lack of strong buying enthusiasm on the spot market shows that bullish sentiment has been replaced by caution. As such, the risk of a breakdown below $99,000 grows unless another wave of demand re-enters. Futures Market Also Cooling Off The slowdown in sentiment is not limited to the spot market. Although Bitcoin is attracting interest on derivatives exchanges, there are clear signs that futures sentiment is waning. Open interest dropped by 7% over the weekend, from 360,000 BTC to 334,000 BTC, and funding rates have been declining steadily since Bitcoin hit its Q1 2025 all-time high. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Could Rally To $110,000 ATH As These Macroeconomic Factors Align Futures market participants had been very active through Bitcoin’s climb to $111,800 in May, but their conviction appears to be fading now. A further indication of a growing reluctance to hold long positions is the sharp decline in both the annualized funding rate and the 3-month rolling basis. Without stronger directional conviction, the futures markets may not provide the upside needed to push Bitcoin to new highs. This situation may instead contribute to additional downward pressure. So far, Bitcoin has respected the $93,000 to $100,000 support zone, which was heavily accumulated during the Q1 2025 top formation. However, with low spot volumes, on-chain activity slowing, and fading futures sentiment, this support could become tested again. If market participants with a cost basis in this zone begin to sell, the resulting pressure could drag Bitcoin below $99,000 again next week. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $107,100.

2025-06-27T23:00:17,"Bitcoin 4-Hour Chart Flashes Bullish Momentum — Breakout Brewing?","Bitcoin is showing signs of renewed strength on the 4-hour chart, with bullish momentum building. The price is climbing steadily, supported by higher lows and improving volume. As BTC pushes against resistance levels, technical indicators are turning upward, reinforcing the bullish outlook. MACD and RSI Point To Bullish Shift Bitcoin is trending upward after a recent downtrend, with the structure setting up for a continuation move. According to Gemxbt, support is holding around $104,000, and resistance is forming near $108,000, creating a tight but favorable trading range. Momentum indicators are flashing bullish signals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is around 60, while the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has confirmed a bullish crossover. Gemxbt points out that an entry around $106,000, with a stop-loss placed at $104,000, looks promising. The analyst also revealed that Bitcoin’s 4-hour chart is shaping up with a consolidation pattern within an upward trend, forming higher lows and higher highs , a classic sign of bullish structure building strength. Currently, key support is around $104,000, providing a solid base for the ongoing trend, while resistance near $110,000 acts as the next hurdle for a breakout. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains neutral, suggesting that there is still room for movement in either direction. The MACD is showing bullish momentum, reinforcing the case for a continuation to the upside. Crypto analyst Elias ₿Lake also mentioned that the Bitcoin daily chart is currently testing resistance, with positive momentum building across the broader Bitcoin landscape. As such, Elias believes the resistance zone won’t last much longer. Additionally, funding rates are negative, indicating the market is in short supply, especially when paired with liquidation maps that show a clear upside. The setup is ready for a breakout, as Elias eyes the $112,000 as the next price target . Bitcoin 4-Hour Chart Flashes Bullish Momentum — Breakout Brewing? Bitcoin has broken above a key trendline on the 1-day chart, confirming a bullish shift after bouncing from a strong demand zone . This breakout marks a technical development, and now, a retest is in progress, often viewed as a prime entry zone before the next leg up. Analyst GîZ highlighted a target of $125,000, assuming the price continues to hold above the support zone between $107,000 and $103,000. This structure represents a textbook break-out and retest, a pattern that often precedes strong upward continuation if the retest holds. Global liquidity is on the rise and starting to reflect in Bitcoin price action. The M2 money supply of liquidity just crossed the $112,000 mark on the 3-month chart, and BTC appears to be closely following that curve. Lastly, Zhao Lusi emphasizes a repeating lead-leg pattern, where liquidity trends first, and BTC follows next.

2025-06-27T23:00:15,"Mullen Automotive Unlocks Future of EV Sales with Crypto Payments","BitcoinWorld Mullen Automotive Unlocks Future of EV Sales with Crypto Payments The world of electric vehicles is constantly evolving, and now, a groundbreaking development is set to redefine how you purchase your next EV. Mullen Automotive , a prominent Nasdaq-listed electric vehicle manufacturer, has officially embraced the digital revolution by announcing its acceptance of crypto payments for its innovative lineup of Mullen and Bollinger commercial vehicles. This bold move signals a significant shift in the automotive industry, blending cutting-edge transportation with the decentralized power of digital currencies. Why is Mullen Automotive Embracing Crypto Payments? In a strategic move designed to broaden its customer base and streamline transactions, Mullen Automotive has positioned itself at the forefront of digital commerce within the automotive sector. The decision to accept cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin isn’t just about novelty; it’s about tapping into a growing demographic of tech-savvy consumers and leveraging the inherent advantages of blockchain technology. Here are some key reasons behind this pioneering initiative: Expanded Customer Reach: By accepting digital assets, Mullen can appeal to a global audience of cryptocurrency holders who might prefer using their digital wealth for high-value purchases. Reduced Transaction Fees: In some cases, cryptocurrency transactions can incur lower fees compared to traditional credit card processing or bank transfers, potentially benefiting both the company and the customer. Faster Settlements: While not instantaneous for all cryptocurrencies, blockchain transactions can often settle faster than conventional banking methods, improving cash flow efficiency. Innovation and Brand Image: Embracing crypto enhances Mullen’s image as a forward-thinking and innovative company, aligning with the progressive nature of electric vehicle technology. Simplified International Transactions: Cryptocurrencies transcend national borders, making it easier for international buyers to purchase EVs without complex currency conversions or banking hurdles. The company specifically highlighted its acceptance of Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s leading cryptocurrency, which brings a level of established trust and liquidity to the payment options. The Unique Choice: TRUMP Meme Coin and Its Implications Perhaps the most unexpected inclusion in Mullen’s initial list of accepted cryptocurrencies is the TRUMP meme coin . This decision has certainly turned heads within both the crypto and automotive communities. While many companies entering the crypto payment space stick to mainstream assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum, Mullen’s choice to include a politically-themed meme coin is a bold differentiator. What does this mean for Mullen Automotive? Targeted Appeal: Accepting a meme coin associated with a specific political figure could potentially resonate with a niche, yet passionate, segment of the market, fostering strong brand loyalty among supporters. Increased Visibility: The unique nature of this choice generates significant media attention and discussion, providing Mullen with valuable publicity. Volatility Considerations: Meme coins are notoriously volatile. Mullen’s strategy will need robust risk management to mitigate potential price fluctuations between the time of purchase and conversion to fiat currency. Mullen’s press release also indicated that the company is actively considering support for other cryptocurrencies, including popular meme coins and stablecoins. This suggests a flexible and adaptive approach to digital payments, aiming to cater to diverse preferences and potentially integrate more stable options in the future. Revolutionizing EV Sales: A Glimpse into the Future of Automotive Commerce The integration of crypto payments by a Nasdaq-listed automotive company like Mullen Automotive is more than just a payment option; it’s a statement about the evolving landscape of commerce. For EV sales , this could mark the beginning of a new era of accessibility and transaction fluidity. Historically, purchasing a vehicle involves traditional financing, bank transfers, or credit. The advent of crypto payments introduces an alternative that aligns with the digital-first mindset of many modern consumers. Imagine a seamless transaction where a buyer can leverage their crypto holdings directly to acquire a high-value asset like an electric vehicle, bypassing some of the conventional financial intermediaries. This move by Mullen follows a broader trend where luxury goods, real estate, and other high-ticket items are increasingly becoming purchasable with digital currencies. While not every car manufacturer has fully committed to crypto payments (Tesla famously dabbled then paused Bitcoin acceptance), Mullen’s steadfast adoption could encourage others to explore similar pathways, further legitimizing cryptocurrencies as a viable medium of exchange for significant purchases. Navigating the Digital Road: Challenges and Considerations for Crypto Payments While the benefits are clear, adopting crypto payments for something as significant as EV sales comes with its own set of challenges that Mullen Automotive will need to navigate carefully: Price Volatility: The fluctuating nature of cryptocurrencies, especially meme coins, poses a risk. Mullen will likely employ third-party payment processors that instantly convert crypto to fiat currency upon transaction to mitigate this risk. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Mullen must ensure compliance with all relevant financial regulations and tax laws. Technical Integration and Security: Implementing a secure and efficient crypto payment system requires robust technical infrastructure and stringent security measures to protect against hacks, scams, and errors. Customer Education: While crypto adoption is growing, many potential EV buyers may not be familiar with using cryptocurrencies for purchases. Providing clear guidance and support will be crucial. Tax Implications: For consumers, using crypto to purchase goods can trigger capital gains taxes depending on their jurisdiction and how long they held the asset. Mullen will need to ensure clear communication on this front. Despite these hurdles, Mullen’s commitment indicates a belief that the long-term advantages outweigh the short-term complexities, positioning them as an innovator in the EV market. Beyond Bitcoin: What Does This Mean for the Broader EV and Crypto Markets? Mullen Automotive’s embrace of Bitcoin and the TRUMP meme coin as payment options for its electric vehicles sends a powerful signal across industries. It reinforces the idea that cryptocurrencies are moving beyond speculative assets to become practical tools for commerce. This development could catalyze further crypto adoption in the automotive sector. If Mullen demonstrates success in attracting new customers and streamlining sales through digital currencies, other EV manufacturers and even traditional automakers might consider integrating similar payment solutions. This could lead to a more widespread acceptance of cryptocurrencies for high-value purchases, accelerating their mainstream integration. Furthermore, it highlights the increasing demand from consumers to have diverse payment options, reflecting a global trend towards digital and decentralized finance. The acceptance of a meme coin like TRUMP also underscores the growing influence of community-driven digital assets, challenging traditional notions of value and utility in the crypto space. Mullen’s pioneering step could pave the way for a future where purchasing an electric vehicle with your preferred digital currency is as common as using a credit card today. It’s a testament to the dynamic convergence of technological innovation in both transportation and finance. Mullen Automotive’s decision to accept crypto payments , including Bitcoin and the TRUMP meme coin , marks a pivotal moment for both the electric vehicle and cryptocurrency industries. It showcases a forward-thinking approach that could redefine EV sales and broaden market accessibility. While challenges remain, this move positions Mullen Automotive as a pioneer, potentially paving the way for wider digital currency adoption in mainstream commerce. As the lines between traditional finance and decentralized currencies continue to blur, innovations like these are crucial in shaping the future of how we transact and what we drive.

2025-06-27T22:44:48,"South Korean Lawmaker Proposes ETF Bill to Include Virtual Assets","Key Takeaways: A bill proposes expanding South Korea’s Capital Markets Act to include digital assets as underlying ETF assets. Trust companies could legally hold and manage digital assets, under clearer rules for delegation and custody. Some industry figures warn that brokering derivatives tied to digital assets requires rigorous risk controls. Min Byung-deok, a member of South Korea Democratic Party, introduced a bill on June 27 to amend the Capital Markets Act, according to News1 . The proposal would expand the scope of underlying assets for ETFs to include digital assets like Bitcoin. The amendment establishes a legal framework allowing trust companies to hold and manage digital assets as trust property. It also outlines conditions for delegating custody of virtual assets to registered service providers. Lawmaker Proposes Bill to Enable Digital Asset-Based ETFs The bill is part of President Lee Jae-myung’s agenda to integrate digital assets into the financial system. A separate roadmap from the Financial Services Commission would permit institutional investors with more than KRW 10 billion in assets to trade virtual assets beginning in late 2025. Supporters say the amendment provides a legal foundation for digital asset-based ETFs and improves investor protections through clear rules on trust management. It also includes measures to expand the derivatives market, allowing risk management strategies using digital assets. Skeptics argue that brokering digital asset derivatives requires strict risk management. Some industry participants say only firms with sufficient capacity should be allowed to offer such products. Currently, South Korea prohibits ETFs that use digital assets as underlying assets, forcing domestic investors to trade abroad or rely on unregulated markets. The new measure could create a regulated pathway to participate in this market domestically. South Korea Moves Forward Amid Global Uncertainty If approved, the amendment would let asset managers develop financial products tied to digital assets, increase ETF market diversity, and boost transparency and oversight in the sector. Min said the bill would promote growth while strengthening protections for Korean investors. While global regulators weigh frameworks for digital asset ETFs, many jurisdictions still grapple with basic questions of valuation, custody, and cross-border compliance. In the absence of uniform standards, countries often move at different speeds, which can lead to regulatory arbitrage and inconsistent protections for investors. Industry observers say any shift in ETF rules could influence broader debates over digital asset taxation, reporting standards, and how digital finance fits into national growth strategies. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Why are some concerned about derivatives provisions? Critics argue that derivatives tied to digital assets involve risks that should be managed by firms with sufficient risk controls. How does this compare with global trends? While the U.S. has approved Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs, many countries still debate rules around custody, taxation, and investor protections. Could this affect other parts of South Korea’s financial regulation? Potentially. Analysts say ETF rules often intersect with tax policy, reporting standards, and national digital finance strategies.

A massive pile of platinum has accumulated under the moon’s surface, according to a paper published in the journal Planetary and Space Science. Lead researcher Jayanth Chennamangalam tells New Scientist that the trillion-dollar estimate stems from findings that around 6,500 lunar craters, each at least 1 kilometer wide, contain significant platinum group metal (PGM) deposits from asteroid impacts. The study spotlights the commercial potential of resources in space, which could attract private investment and reduce reliance on government funding for space exploration. And lunar mining could be far more viable than extracting resources from near-Earth asteroids, with the moon offering a vastly larger number of potential mining sites. Beyond its appeal in jewelry, platinum is coveted for its strength and vital use in high-tech applications, powering everything from clean energy solutions to life-saving medical equipment. The precious metal’s price has soared this year, climbing over 30% to around $1,400 per troy ounce, driven by a global supply deficit and rising demand from the automotive and jewelry sectors.

According to a new U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) press release , Jose “Meno” Martinez of Guadalajara, Mexico, helped drug traffickers launder money in Mexico. Martinez laundered $5.5 million in drug money, transferring the funds to Mexico via crypto while keeping a percentage fee for himself. As a result of Martinez’s dealings, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has seized $1.35 million in bulk US currency, in addition to “approximately 3 kilograms of fentanyl, 52.77 kilograms of cocaine, 7,078.63 kilograms of unconverted methamphetamine in the form of charcoal lumps, 170 gallons of unconverted methamphetamine in the form of coconut oil, 140 kilograms of methamphetamine and 15 gallons of liquid methamphetamine.” Earlier this week, the DOJ also announced that two Florida men are facing the possibility of multiple decades in prison after allegedly masterminding a fraudulent scheme to steal over $100 million from a nonprofit organization set up to manage funds for people with special needs and disabilities. The DOJ alleges that Leo Joseph Govoni, John Leo Witeck and one unnamed co-conspirator purloined the Center for Special Needs Trust Administration client-beneficiary funds and concealed their embezzlement through complex financial transactions, allegedly sending fraudulent account statements with false balances to their disabled clients.

While bulls struggle to break above the all-time high at $112,000, the market remains in a high-stakes consolidation phase. Macroeconomic conditions remain unstable, with weak global growth forecasts and elevated inflation pushing investors into risk-off assets. Still, Bitcoin appears to be thriving under these pressures, strengthening its case as a hedge against traditional financial instability. Related Reading: Ethereum Fakes Out Bears – Altcoin Rally Depends On Key Level Breakout Top analyst Carl Runefelt recently highlighted a compelling technical development: Bitcoin is forming a massive inverse head and shoulders pattern spanning the last four years. This rare and long-term formation typically signals a bullish reversal and, if confirmed, could mark the beginning of a powerful breakout into price discovery. Runefelt notes that the neckline of this pattern aligns with current resistance just below $112K, making the coming weeks crucial for market direction. As the crypto market digests geopolitical tensions, central bank policy shifts, and on-chain accumulation trends, Bitcoin’s ability to stay elevated signals growing investor conviction. All eyes are now on whether BTC can complete this historic pattern and launch the next leg of the bull run. Bitcoin At A Critical Crossroads Bitcoin is trading at a pivotal level that could determine the market’s next major move — a breakout into new all-time highs or a retrace toward lower demand zones. After surging over 10% since last Sunday, the bullish sentiment is building rapidly, but the price remains stuck in a tight range between $100,000 and $110,000. Bulls are confident and in control of momentum, yet they’ve repeatedly failed to push BTC above the key $110K resistance. At the same time, bears have been unable to take the price below the $100K psychological support, signaling equilibrium and mounting pressure for a breakout. This standoff has kept volatility high, with macroeconomic uncertainty and geopolitical instability adding fuel to the fire. Still, the current market structure appears constructive for Bitcoin. If bulls can finally break above the $110K level and push into price discovery, it would confirm the strength behind this rally and potentially spark a new phase of exponential growth. Carl Runefelt believes a major breakout may be on the horizon. His technical analysis reveals a massive inverse head and shoulders pattern forming over the last four years — a rare and highly bullish setup. According to Runefelt, traders should be “ready for a crazy pump” if Bitcoin breaks through the neckline near $112K. Historically, this type of pattern precedes explosive rallies, and given the long-term nature of this one, the upside potential could be significant. As long-term holders accumulate and market liquidity builds, the coming weeks may determine whether Bitcoin cements its breakout or returns to test deeper support. Either way, this moment is shaping up to be one of the most decisive junctures in the current bull cycle. Related Reading: Ethereum Reclaims $2,444 Level – Bullish Continuation In Focus BTC Price Analysis: Key Resistance Blocks Price Discovery Bitcoin is currently trading at $107,144 on the daily chart, showing modest gains but facing strong resistance as it nears the $109,300 level. The chart highlights a clearly defined horizontal structure between $103,600 and $109,300 — a range Bitcoin has respected for nearly two months. Bulls remain in control short term, having reclaimed all three major moving averages: the 50-day ($105,800), 100-day ($96,784), and 200-day ($96,136) SMAs. The most recent bounce off the $103,600 support zone was followed by rising volume, indicating a potential shift in momentum back to the upside. However, BTC has yet to close convincingly above $109,300, which continues to cap any price discovery attempts. A breakout above this level could open the door to new all-time highs and trigger an aggressive bullish continuation. Related Reading: Chainlink Reclaims Key Structure – Quiet Accumulation Could Fuel $25–$30 Surge On the downside, failure to breach resistance and a drop below $105K could reintroduce bearish pressure and trigger a retest of the lower range. For now, Bitcoin remains range-bound with bullish bias, but buyers need to follow through with strong volume and a clean break above the $109K barrier to fully confirm market intent.

As Bitcoin continues to show strength, several meme coins have seen a slight decline in buzz, including Doge , which has traded relatively calmly over the last three days. BTC is gathering liquidity for a major move, though volume is likely to flow back into top meme coins if the price consolidates. Other flagship crypto assets, like BCH and ETH, posted a minor increase today, while Dog currently sees the most gain among the top 20 meme coins, as Fartcoin and Popcat shed major losses in the last 24 hours. Solana-Based Meme Are Still Popping Out Gains For Bitcoin, which still remains strong on the intraday trading, tokens on the Solana network are still trying to stay afloat amid the current daily price shakeout, especially the newly launched ones on the Dex, which are now popping insane gains like Mori, Joboy and Farthouse. While Sui network floods with undervalued meme coins are capped under $120 million, yet to get investors’ attention for a long-term gain due to low hype and weak community base, Brett -7%, Toshi -7% and Degen -12% are currently down as they lead meme coins chart on Base. Aside from Ethereum and BSC-based assets, some Artificial Intelligence tokens on Virtuals are also not left behind in the latest reductions as they have recorded major losses since yesterday. Alpha Tokens on CEXs Defy The Odds Since Bitcoin’s price bounced back last weekend, assets on the Alpha sector have gained more trading attention than any other for a couple of days. In fact, they currently defy the latest market odds as several meme coins see a sizeable volume outflow in the past hours. In contrast to the recent drops in meme coin prices, many Alpha tokens trading on CEXs have remained in the spotlight as Bitcoin sustains momentum. If the primary cryptocurrency continues to show strength, tokens in this sector may gain more traction as the market demand increases daily. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The rollout started with tokenized shares of Strategy (MSTR), known as the world's largest corporate bitcoin BTC holder, with more stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to be added in the coming days, the firm said in an X post. Gemini said it partnered with Dinari, a firm focused on tokenizing real-world assets, to issue the tokens. Dinari obtained a broker-dealer registration from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) earlier this week, allowing the firm to offer tokenized versions of U.S. stocks. The move comes as demand grows for bringing traditional financial instruments such as equities onto blockchain rails, also known as tokenization of real-world assets. Crypto exchanges Coinbase and Kraken are also seeking to expand into tokenized securities trading, while Robinhood is reportedly working on offering tokenized U.S. stocks for EU users.

2025-06-27T21:35:48,"Why instant crypto exchanges are essential for traders in 2025","Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. With crypto booming in 2025, instant exchanges like Quickex offer fast, hassle-free swaps for traders at every level. It’s 2025, and the crypto market’s on fire. Bitcoin has sailed past $100,000, Ethereum is driving a DeFi explosion, and new tokens are dropping left and right. Whether someone is just dipping their toes in or trading like a pro, they need a way to swap coins fast without getting bogged down. That’s where instant crypto exchanges shine, and platforms like Quickex make it feel effortless. Here’s why these tools are a go-to in today’s wild market and what sets them apart. You might also like: Dow Jones up 500 points as trade and Fed optimism sweeps the market Why fast crypto swaps are changing the game for traders Previously, cryptocurrency transactions were a nightmare; endless forms, days of waiting, and constant worry about funds. Instant exchanges like Quickex have flipped that script. They’re like grabbing coffee to go: pick coins, swap, and it’s done in minutes. With over 1,000 trading pairs, users can do things like exchange Bitcoin or chase any hot altcoin. It’s a breeze, whether someone is new to crypto or a market junkie. The best part? There’s no need to be a tech wizard. The interface is as simple as texting a friend. Choose a pair, hit confirm, and move on with the day. It’s built for real people who just want to get things done. How does a crypto exchange in 3 simple steps look? Select the cryptocurrency to exchange and the one to receive — for example, BTC to USDT . Input the amount and a wallet address. Double-check everything to ensure accuracy. Make the payment to the generated address. Once the transaction is confirmed, the exchanged crypto will be sent to the wallet, usually within minutes. Top features that make instant crypto platforms stand out in 2025 Here’s what to know about what makes the best instant exchanges popular in 2025: Tons of Trading Pairs: Top platforms offer over 1,000 pairs so that people can swap Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero, or whatever’s trending. The platform gives anyone that flexibility, letting them pivot to any coin that’s catching fire. It’s like a crypto playground – endless choices, no limits. Ironclad Security: In crypto, keeping money safe is non-negotiable. Quickex doesn’t store user funds – everything stays in a user’s own wallet, giving them full control. Think of it as keeping cash under the mattress, but with high-tech encryption to lock out thieves. This setup ensures funds are as secure as it gets. Speed: When the market’s moving, every second counts. Quickex gets swaps done in 5-10 minutes with fees starting at 0.5%. No mandatory KYC means privacy is kept, especially for coins like Monero that are all about staying low-key. Developer Perks: For those building a crypto app, instant exchanges are a lifeline. Quickex’s crypto exchange API lets developers weave swap features into their platforms, making crypto smooth for users. It’s perfect for the web3 craze taking over in 2025. Crypto market trends in 2025: Why Flexibility matters more than ever Zoom out, and the market’s a whirlwind. Bitcoin’s a rockstar, pulling in everyone from big banks. Ethereum’s the engine behind DeFi, with new projects launching daily. Monero’s still the pick for anyone who wants their moves off the radar. Instant exchanges let everyone bounce between these worlds, swapping Bitcoin for Ethereum to catch a dip or diving into Monero for privacy. It’s about staying nimble in a market that’s always on the move. Why instant crypto swaps matter in a volatile global economy In 2025, the world feels shaky – geopolitical tensions, economic uncertainty, you name it. It’s practically pushing people to keep their money safe and stay on top of tech that protects their freedom. Instant exchanges are a smart move for anyone who values privacy and doesn’t have hours to waste. Quickex, with its massive range of pairs and focus on keeping funds in the user’s control, fits the bill. Whether someone is exchanging BTC to XMR to stay private, using the exchange API for their app, or exploring exchanges to dive into crypto, these platforms let them move fast and stay secure in a world that demands both.

2025-06-27T21:15:00,"Trump Coin Price Prediction: Chart Shows 100% Move Coming Up – Time to Buy?","The downward consolidation that has capped Trump coin price action since mid-May is nearing its breakout point, strengthening the short-term price outlook with a potential 2x move. While the April setup featured a 20-day continuation pattern, the current formation flashes a classic reversal pattern that has developed over 60 days—a prolonged buildup of momentum. Meme coins continue to struggle under the FUD of geopolitical tensions, with the Israel-Iran conflict unresolved—TRUMP remains 45% below its presidential dinner peak. Derivatives Traders Are Betting on a TRUMP Rally Open interest is showing signs of recovery, rising 3% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGlass data . Speculative interest is building with traders actively following WIF price moves.

TRUMP 12-hour long/short ratio. Source: Coinglass. Trump Price Analysis: Is it Time to Buy? With a bounce from the lower support of a falling wedge in the early week—a classic bullish reversal pattern—the TRUMP coin price appears to be approaching a key breakout point. TRUMP / USDT 1-day price chart, bullish falling wedge reversal pattern. Source: TradingView, Binance. A confluence zone is now forming where historic accumulation just below $9.15 intersects with the wedge’s upper resistance trendline, increasing pressure for an upside move. Momentum indicators support the bullish setup. The MACD line has widened its marginal lead above the signal line following a golden cross—an early sign that a trend reversal is taking root. More so, the RSI has rebounded from oversold territory at 30, signaling seller exhaustion and presenting buyers with an opportunity to take control of the prevailing trend. If this setup mirrors the April breakout from a symmetrical triangle—a continuation pattern—a similar 2x gain could be on the cards, targeting the early March peak at $17.70. This local top marked the market trajectory pre-tariff war. With a US-China trade deal and potential for an EU trade deal soon, these past headwinds may be clearing for a continuation. The European Union has expressed its readiness to negotiate a trade agreement with the United States. pic.twitter.com/rki2CLvn6R — Okenwa Crypto. (@OkenwaCrypto1) June 26, 2025 However, considering the two-month build-up of the falling wedge, pressure could push an upward move even higher towards the February post-inauguration rally top around $24. Still, if the accumulation zone fails, the bullish setup could be invalidated. The next key support lies at $7.15, a 20% drop from current prices to retest the mid-April market bottom. Bitcoin Could be the Bigger Play – With Some Help Those who jumped to more speculative plays like TRUMP coin over the leading crypto may be forced to reconsider as the Bitcoin ecosystem finally addresses its biggest limitation: scalability. Slow transactions, high fees, and limited programmability have held it back from competing with the Ethereum and Solana networks—until now. And this shift starts with Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , Bitcoin’s first real-time Layer 2 that brings Solana-level speed and smart contracts directly to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) and anchored by a decentralized Canonical Bridge, it enables fast, cheap, and composable dApps—all while staying secured by Bitcoin. With almost $1.7 million in its third presale week, investors are already rallying behind $HYPER , potentially credited to its huge 466% APY on staking that rewards early investors.

2025-06-27T21:00:49,"Chainlink (LINK) On Standby: Bitcoin’s Next Move Holds The Key","Chainlink (LINK) ended its latest session in a holding pattern, with indecisive candles and choppy intraday action pointing to a lack of clear direction. Traders now look to Bitcoin’s next move for guidance; any meaningful shift in BTC dominance could quickly tilt LINK’s price action. Until the market leader shows its hand, LINK remains on standby, hovering near key support while waiting for a decisive cue. Falling Wedge Holds The Key To Chainlink Next Big Move In a recent X post, CRYPTOWZRD provided an update on Chainlink’s daily technical outlook, noting that the daily candles for both LINK and LINKBTC closed indecisively. This indecision reflects uncertainty in the market as traders await clearer direction. The lack of a strong trend suggests a pause before the next significant move. Related Reading: Chainlink Bears Push Toward $12.50 As Weekend Volatility Looms The analyst highlighted that LINKBTC is currently forming a falling wedge pattern, which is generally considered a bullish formation, especially when it appears in oversold conditions. He stressed that a breakout from this wedge is essential for Chainlink to trigger the next impulsive move upward, signaling a potential shift in momentum. CRYPTOWZRD explained that this breakout is more likely to occur once Bitcoin dominance begins to decline. As Bitcoin’s grip loosens, altcoins like LINK tend to gain strength and follow suit. Therefore, monitoring Bitcoin dominance will be key in anticipating LINK’s next move. Regarding support levels, CRYPTOWZRD identified $12.50 as the critical next support target. A strong reversal from this point could ignite a rally toward the $16 resistance level or higher. This level will serve as a crucial testing ground for bullish momentum. He concluded by mentioning that his focus remains on lower-timeframe charts to identify quick scalp opportunities. While the broader trend is developing, CRYPTOWZRD is looking to capitalize on shorter-term movements, keeping a close eye on price action and volatility. Choppy Intraday Action Keeps Bulls Cautious Wrapping up the analysis, the analyst highlighted that LINK’s intraday chart remained sluggish and choppy, offering little in terms of clear directional bias. A possible retest of the $12.85 support level—or even a minor dip below it—could still present a bullish reversal opportunity, potentially paving the way for a push toward the $14.40 resistance target. Related Reading: Chainlink Holders Set Record As 1-Yr MVRV Signals ‘Opportunity’ However, the analyst warned that if Chainlink holds below the $12.85 level, it could slip into prolonged sideways movement. This uncertain behavior will likely hinge on Bitcoin’s overall market direction, which continues to heavily influence altcoin performance. With no clear trade setup currently in play, the analyst concluded that it’s best to remain patient for a cleaner structure to emerge before making any decisive moves.

2025-06-27T20:55:08,"XRP news: Ripple’s legal loss, $439m transfer ignite selloff dominoes","A legal battle hanging in limbo and a mysterious $439 million XRP transfer by Ripple coincided with a brutal wave of long liquidations that saw traders caught in the crossfire. The turbulence began shortly after U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres rejected a proposed settlement between Ripple Labs ( XRP ) and the SEC, dashing hopes of a swift resolution to the years-long securities lawsuit. Almost simultaneously, blockchain trackers spotted Ripple moving half a billion dollars’ worth of XRP to an undisclosed wallet, just as leveraged traders were piling into bullish bets. These events spooked the market, triggering a cascade of liquidations totaling $7.18 million, with longs outnumbering shorts by nearly 10-to-1, according to CoinGlass data. While the broader crypto sector showed signs of stabilization, XRP’s lopsided positioning turned a 5.3% drop into a bloodbath for overexposed traders, revealing the token’s overreliance on speculative optimism, with little defense against Ripple’s own corporate moves or legal headwinds. How Ripple’s corporate moves and legal woes likely fueled XRP’s decline The $7.18 million long liquidation event was the culmination of mounting pressure from Ripple’s opaque treasury management and unresolved legal battles. While Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) weathered broader market turbulence with relative stability, XRP’s 45.62% drop from its all-time high of $3.84 underscores a deeper issue: the token’s price action remains disproportionately tied to Ripple’s corporate decisions rather than organic demand. This week’s 5.3% slide, while not extreme in isolation, struck hard because of its timing. It came just as traders were positioning for a potential breakout above the $2.17 resistance. Judge Analisa Torres’ rejection of Ripple’s proposed SEC settlement reinforced the market’s worst fears. Without clarity on whether XRP will face stricter securities enforcement, institutional players remain hesitant to commit. This regulatory limbo has kept XRP range-bound between $2.00 and $2.60 since March, despite the token’s CME futures listing and whispers of a potential ETF. For traders, the message is clear: until the SEC case concludes, XRP’s upside will be capped by skepticism. Add in Ripple’s $439 million transfer to a shadow wallet, and the market had the perfect recipe for forced deleveraging. RLUSD Minting Amid the chaos, Ripple has quietly accelerated its stablecoin ambitions, minting 50 million RLUSD this month alone. The move aligns with the booming $252 billion stablecoin market, where giants like Tether and Circle generate massive revenue from Treasury-backed reserves. If RLUSD gains traction, it could provide Ripple with a lucrative revenue stream independent of XRP’s volatility. But for XRP holders, the bigger question is whether RLUSD adoption will translate into ecosystem stability. In theory, deeper liquidity and institutional use cases for Ripple’s stablecoin could bolster demand for XRP as a bridge asset. However, if RLUSD overshadows XRP in Ripple’s own financial strategy, the token risks becoming an afterthought in the company’s long-term vision.",crypto_news,https://crypto.news/xrp-news-ripples-legal-loss-439m-transfer-ignite-selloff-dominoes/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP","News|Ripple|SEC|XRP",cryptocompare
2025-06-27T20:44:51,"Kraken Launches Krak: P2P App for Crypto and Fiat in 110 Countries","Kraken, the world's oldest crypto exchange, has unveiled Krak, the next-generation peer-to-peer payments app that seeks to merge the freedom of cryptocurrency with the convenience of everyday finance. “Krak is live! Send crypto or fiat to anyone, anywhere, instantly—no banks, no borders, no fees. This is the future.” — @krakenfx Compatible with 110 countries, Krak allows users to send, receive, and store over 300 assets—from cryptocurrencies and stablecoins to local fiat—beyond the restriction of traditional banks or wallet addresses. How Krak Works At its essence, Krak is designed for a digital-native generation. The app allows users to send money across the world in seconds, via a unique payment ID called a Kraktag—no bank information or crypto wallet addresses needed. Be it sending Bitcoin to a friend in Berlin or euros to relatives in Lagos, Krak processes in-app for fiat and on-chain for crypto, keeping things speedy and inexpensive. Krak also features built-in crypto-to-fiat conversion, allowing users to instantly swap between digital assets and local currencies at competitive rates. The app’s intuitive interface supports recurring payments, bill splitting, and multi-currency wallets, making it ideal for freelancers, digital nomads, and families with cross-border ties. Early reviews praise Krak’s speed and transparency, highlighting its potential to disrupt both traditional banking and legacy payment apps. Launch-day key features : P2P transfers in 110 countries, on 300+ crypto and fiat currencies Kraktags for instant, private transfers Earn up to 4.1% on balances of USDG stablecoin, and up to 10% on 20+ digital assets No-lockup, minimum , or subscription spend and earn accounts Kraken's backend leverages its global network of money transmitter licenses and banking relationships to enable Krak to serve as an all-in-one financial center. Fee Structure, Rewards, and Future Roadmap Krak is becoming a ”PayPal-killer” with no or ultra-low fees on most transfers—especially against the 2–2.5% of the likes of Revolut and Cash App. Users can earn up to 4.1% on USDG balances and up to 10% on select digital assets, with rewards disbursed daily and no lock-ins. In the future, Kraken will launch: Physical and virtual Krak cards to spend at millions of merchants worldwide Advance-payment services like lending, loans, and credit cards Enhanced business and company instruments for global payroll and B2B payments International Expansion and Regulatory Barriers Kraken's move comes after years of building compliance infrastructure, licensing in the U.S., U.K., EU, Canada, and beyond. Krak is still not available in Australia and sanctioned regions, rollouts to roll out behind local regulation. The company's regulatory seriousness is considered to be a differentiation from less compliant fintech rivals. Competing With Coinbase, Revolut, and Cash App Krak's launch puts Kraken directly against fintech giants. Compared to Coinbase, Krak offers broader asset coverage and lower fees but is still more convenient for new users. Compared to Revolut, Krak offers more cryptocurrency functionality, higher yields, and lower transaction fees. Cash App and Venmo dominate U.S. P2P payments but have less broad crypto coverage and higher fees. Bottom line With Krak, Kraken is betting that the future of money is instant, borderless, and multi-asset. By meshing the agility of crypto with the convenience of everyday payments, Kraken is going to serve traders, yes, but also anyone who has to send, spend, and make their money worldwide—without the hassles of old banking.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9740/kraken-launches-krak-p2-p-app-for-crypto-and-fiat-in-110-countries,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

2025-06-27T20:25:10,"Number of Large Bitcoin Investors Surge to Multi-Month Highs: Do They Know Something?","On-chain data from the market intelligence platform Santiment shows that the number of wallets holding at least 10 BTC has returned to levels not seen since March. This surge in whale and shark activity coincides with massive institutional inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs and signals deep-pocketed confidence despite recent price consolidation below critical resistance. Whales Feast Amidst Retail Jitters According to Santiment, there has been a spike in the number of whale and shark wallets holding over 10 BTC, equivalent to over $1.07 million at the current price. The number has steadily grown in the last few weeks to hit 152,280, a level last seen on March 12, reflecting long-term optimism from experienced investors. These heavy hitters typically act during moments of retail panic, scooping up discounted BTC in what analysts call “smart money” behavior. This activity dovetails with a recent observation from market watcher Axel Adler Jr., who earlier in the week pointed out that despite $66 billion in realized profits over the past two months, mainly from short-term holders, Bitcoin’s price has held firm. In his assessment, the resilience was largely due to new demand absorbing these sell-offs, indicating significant buy-side strength. Moreover, earlier in the month, Binance saw nearly 4,500 BTC withdrawn in a single day, with over $800 million in stablecoin inflows that same week. The dual action of BTC exiting exchanges and fresh liquidity arriving was a possible pointer to a deep accumulation phase, potentially led by whales positioning for future upside. ETF flows also add another dimension to the story, with reports of U.S. spot BTC ETFs pulling in nearly $1.5 billion in just three days, marking one of its most aggressive accumulation periods since inception. BlackRock’s IBIT was at the forefront of this charge, purchasing 9,400 BTC this week alone. Price Action Stagnant At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $107,353, down slightly by 0.4% in the last 24 hours and a more noticeable 2.6% for the week. This means that despite a respectable 3.1% uptick over the past fortnight, the king cryptocurrency still underperformed the broader crypto market, which had gained 3% over seven days. The asset previously touched $108,066 but failed to hold that level, with investor Daan Crypto Trades noting that it is consolidating just under the critical $108,000 to $110,000 resistance zone. In his estimation, a breakout from the current wedge pattern could open the path to a new all-time high for BTC, provided it clears the range. Bitcoin’s dominance is also up. It is currently at 62.8% but previously reached 65.7%, its highest level in four years, suggesting that capital is flowing into BTC rather than altcoins.

The company announced today that it has launched micro futures contracts for XRP and Solana, along with a micro version of its existing “Bitcoin Friday” futures. Micro-futures are smaller in scale than traditional futures contracts, allowing investors to speculate or hedge against asset price movements with lower capital requirements and risk. These products are often preferred for assets such as stock indices, commodities and currencies. Related News: List of the Most Discussed Words in the Cryptocurrency Community in the Last 24 Hours Published - Two Altcoins Are Trending Robinhood began gradually rolling out futures products for foreign exchange (FX), index, commodity, and cryptocurrency markets earlier this year.

The analyst, pseudonymously known as Capo, tells his 128,716 Telegram subscribers that Solana ( SOL ) is currently testing a resistance level that was previously a support zone. According to Capo, Solana could fall by up to 58% from the current level after failing to break above a level last reached late last month. “After the current dead-cat bounce, it’s now testing another important resistance, which was support before (support/resistance flip). Main target remains $60 to $80.” Source: CryptoCapo/Telegram Solana is trading at $143 at time of writing, down by around 51% from the all-time high reached in January. Turning to Bitcoin ( BTC ), Capo says the crypto king is facing strong resistance at the level just below $109,000. Based on the pseudonymous analyst’s chart of the one-day time frame, it appears Capo is suggesting that Bitcoin could first fall to a support level around the price of $93,000. Capo also appears to suggest that Bitcoin could capitulate even further and revisit the zone between $60,000 and $70,000, levels last witnessed in October of 2024. “If you think we’ve seen it all… think again.” Source: CryptoCapo/Telegram Bitcoin is trading at $107,197 at time of writing, down by around 4% from the current level.

2025-06-27T20:00:30,"Bitcoin Gets The Greenlight To Be Counted As Assets For Mortgage Applications, But What About XRP?","A major breakthrough has just arrived for Bitcoin and the crypto industry from one of the most influential financial regulatory bodies in the United States. The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), which oversees the country’s largest mortgage liquidity providers, has issued a directive that could change how digital assets are viewed. Under this directive, mortgage liquidity providers have been officially ordered to begin preparations for considering cryptocurrencies as part of a borrower’s asset portfolio during mortgage evaluations. Crypto As Mortgage-Eligible Asset In a recent post on the social media platform X, FHFA Director Bill Pulte issued a directive instructing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to prepare proposals that allow homebuyers to count cryptocurrency holdings held on US-regulated exchanges as part of their asset reserves for mortgage applications without converting them into dollars. Related Reading: These Companies Are Following Saylor’s Strategy Into The Bitcoin Battleground With Over $2 Billion Slated To Buy BTC Crypto assets have always been excluded from mortgage risk assessments unless converted to U.S. dollars before closing. However, this recent move breaks that barrier. This policy shift aligns with former President Donald Trump’s campaigns to establish the United States as the crypto capital of the world. Pulte, who was recently sworn in as the 5th Director of U.S. Federal Housing FHFA in March 2025, is now part of those taking steps to make this vision a reality. According to the order, both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac must also factor in market volatility and enforce strong risk-based adjustments before implementing the new assessment method. Fannie and Freddie are government-sponsored enterprises that do not issue mortgages themselves but play an important role in the housing market by purchasing home loans on the secondary market and setting the criteria for the loans they are willing to acquire. Bitcoin To Benefit The Most, But Where Does XRP Stand? Bitcoin is going to benefit the most from this policy update. Being the largest and most widely held cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has long been considered the digital gold standard, which makes it a natural candidate for institutional recognition. Related Reading: Crypto Pundit Reveals Why This Bitcoin Bull Market Feels Different As Crypto Enters ‘New Era’ Its established presence on U.S.-regulated exchanges and deep liquidity profile through Spot Bitcoin ETFs tick nearly every box laid out in the FHFA’s directive. However, the decision raises an important question for XRP holders as to whether the same regulation will be extended to XRP. Unlike Bitcoin, XRP has had a complicated history with regulatory agencies in the US, most notably the SEC. Although recent legal clarity around XRP has allowed the crypto to resume trading on major US-based exchanges, it isn’t really certain whether Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will be quick to include it under this new directive. Nonetheless, the FHFA’s directive doesn’t specify eligible tokens. It simply refers to cryptocurrencies held on US-regulated exchanges. As such, the directive could be quick to include US-based cryptocurrencies like XRP and Ethereum alongside Bitcoin. Other countries are already far ahead with XRP in real estate. In Japan, for instance, Open House Group allows XRP payments for property purchases in cities such as Tokyo and Osaka. Dubai is also using the XRP Ledger to tokenize real estate.

2025-06-27T20:00:00,"Bitcoin Hits 105K As One DeFi Token Gets Ready To Explode 4,300%","The crypto market is roaring again after Trump announced a deal had been reached with Iran and Israel. After briefly falling below $100k as tensions escalated in the Middle East, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) has recovered to over $105,000. One of the factors that has allowed Bitcoin (BTC) to remain relatively stable throughout the conflict is the growing institutional interest in BTC. US-traded Bitcoin Spot ETFs have seen continued inflows, which signals that investor confidence remains high. Amid the upbeat mood in the crypto sector, investors are looking for options for massive gains. One of the options that has gained mass attention so far is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The project is currently in the presale phase, where it has enjoyed a lot of success. According to analysts, this could be one of the leading projects for explosive growth in 2025, based on the results of the ongoing presale. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in phase 5 of the presale, where tokens are going for $0.03 each. The price is a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. These gradual increases are expected to continue until the final listing price of $0.06. In the upcoming phase 6, the price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. One of the reasons for the massive success of the presale is the expected beta launch of the Mutuum Finance platform on day one of the token listing. This beta launch will boost organic mentions of MUTM tokens and could push the price to new highs. It will boost interest in the project overall and lead to a rush to secure tokens before the live launch of the platform. According to analysts, this could cause the price of MUTM tokens to rise by 4,300%. Based on that forecast, a $1,900 investment in the current phase of the presale could grow to over $81,000. That is a massive return that investors in phase 5 of the presale are keen to secure. With tokens currently available at a 50% discount, this presents the best time to get your tokens. CertiK Partnership The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team is highly focused on the security of its protocol. In line with efforts to ensure the best security possible, the team submitted the code for a CertiK audit. They passed the audit, and they have a token Scan Score of 95 on CertiK. On top of the audit, the team has sought to partner with CertiK to ensure the continuous security of the protocol, long after it goes live. This partnership has taken the form of a Bug Bounty Program. The program will have a $50,000 pot set aside to reward bug hunters. To ensure fairness, the program has been split into four tiers of severity. These are critical, major, minor, and low, with those that identify the most critical vulnerabilities getting the rewards. By adding CertiK as a key partner in the development and maintenance of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ecosystem, it will boost trust in MUTM tokens. Additionally, it will serve to reassure potential protocol users that it is safe. These factors combined could make Mutuum Finance (MUTM) one of the biggest DeFi platforms by user numbers when it goes live. Details Of The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Protocol Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a DeFi protocol where users can participate as lenders, liquidators, or borrowers. The lenders deposit their assets into the protocol’s liquidity pool and earn interest, while borrowers can obtain loans by depositing overcollateralized collateral. The level of overcollateralization is determined by protocol parameters, chief amongst them the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. Each asset accepted for use on the protocol is assigned its own unique LTV, based on factors that include its liquidity and volatility. The more volatile an asset is, for example, the more conservative an LTV it will be assigned. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ecosystem does not require individual loan matching. Instead, it is based on collective pools with the associated borrowings and collateral. Interest rates on the protocol for both borrowers and lenders are determined automatically by market conditions. When there is a high proportion of funds being actively borrowed in a pool, the interest rate goes up. This process ensures that there is optimal capital efficiency. To ensure that liquidity on the protocol is protected, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team has placed various safeguards in place. These include address screening and asset screening. When it comes to address screening, the project will rely on a third-party service, which will check all addresses before they join the protocol. In terms of asset screening, various checks will be performed. They include checking the validity of a token’s price oracle, its centralization, volatility, and liquidity. The checks will be performed on listed assets as well, and if they fall below safe levels, a token may be delisted, or its use paused until the issue can be investigated. Conclusion Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the most exciting crypto projects of 2025. With a massive 50% discount on offer for buyers in the current phase, this could represent your best opportunity to make returns of 43x or higher when the MUTM tokens go live.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, the crypto analytics firm Bitcoin Vector tells its audience that liquidity cautiously returning to the top crypto asset by market cap is a sign of an upcoming bull market. “The signal we’ve been waiting for: Bitcoin liquidity has shown its first meaningful expansion in June after reaching a three-year low. With BTC consolidating below its ATH, liquidity supports any sustained upside. While not a breakout, it’s a constructive shift. Capital is cautiously returning, laying the groundwork for the next leg.” Source: Bitcoin Vector/X According to the crypto intelligence firm, BTC is displaying a pattern that has historically led to gains. “Structure shift + price momentum: a duo we want to see. A potential Bitcoin leg up begins with this setup: Bullish momentum + structure shift confirmation (highlighted in blue). We just triggered the same pattern again. This setup historically leads to strong upside.” Source: Bitcoin Vector/X Bitcoin Vector goes on to note that the crypto king has been outperforming Ethereum ( ETH ) – the second-largest digital asset by trading volume – over the last year, meaning that ETH is now “undervalued and under-owned” and in “catch-up mode.” “Over the past year, BTC outperformed ETH massively: BTC rose +74% while ETH fell -28% But that strength has come at a cost BTC’s dominance is stretched, while ETH is now under-owned, undervalued, and in catch-up mode. Rotation season is near.” Source: Bitcoin Vector/X Bitcoin is trading for $107,140 at time of writing, while Ethereum is valued at $2,434, both marginal increases on the day.

2025-06-27T19:53:37,"Euro Stablecoin Market Nears $500M, Outpaces Dollar’s Growth","The euro-denominated stablecoin market is tearing higher in 2025, climbing almost 30% to near a $500 million mark and outperforming the expansion of dollar-backed competition on a percentage basis. This rally is being fueled by a convergence of macroeconomic forces, regulatory certainty, and a rising euro, laying the groundwork for the euro to take on the dollar's dominance in the digital asset ecosystem. Strength of Euro and Contrasting Monetary Policy Drive Demand The euro has appreciated by a whopping 12.88% against the U.S. dollar year to date, reaching its highest since 2021. A lot of this currency appreciation is due to the aggressive tightening by the European Central Bank (ECB) compared to the more relaxed approach of the Federal Reserve in the face of sustained fears of inflation. The result? Investors and institutions alike are being forced to seek alternatives to the U.S. dollar, driving demand for euro-backed digital assets and stablecoins. Market watchers say the move is part of a broader ”Sell America” trend as money flows out of U.S. assets and into Bitcoin, the euro, and gold. Top macro strategist Jens Nordvig cites rising demand for BTC and EUR call options as a sign that investors are protecting themselves against USD volatility and going long on the euro's ongoing strength. This macroclimate has laid rich soil for euro-denominated stablecoins, which are being used more and more as a store of value and transactional currency in DeFi and cross-border payments. EURC Pioneers the Way: Historic Growth and Multi-Chain Growth Circle's EURC stablecoin paces the way, with supply increasing 138% to over $200 million in market value during the first half of 2025. EURC has become the largest euro stablecoin, getting picked up quickly on Ethereum, Solana, and Base. On-chain activity is taking off: active accounts for EURC are up 66% to 22,000, and monthly transfer volume has grown 47% to over $2.5 billion. While still overshadowed by USDC and USDT, EURC's activity is forthcoming—especially since euro stablecoins have now begun to represent an expanding share of the $230 billion global stablecoin market. Other euro-backed tokens, such as Stasis EURS and Tether's EURT, are also picking up once more, but Circle's regulatory alignment and MiCA compliance made EURC the go-to token for institutions and DeFi protocols. EURC is already heavily adopted on lending platforms like Aave, DEXs like Uniswap and Curve, and as collateral for new euro-denominated DeFi products. MiCA Rules The Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) rule by the European Union is a key stimulant for euro stablecoin growth. MiCA has stringent standards for issuer licensing, transparency, and reserves, guaranteeing investors that euro-denominated tokens are secure and in line. The European Commission is expected to affirm stablecoins created outside the EU will be treated as equivalent to the licensed ones in the EU, also opening doors to global adoption. While the ECB has warned that stablecoins pose a threat to traditional banks during stress conditions, markets embrace MiCA's ease. Euro stablecoins are therefore becoming more seen as a regulated, safe haven for retail and institutional buyers alike—especially with euro-denominated DeFi rails expanding and an increasing number of protocols backing EURC and its cousins. Can the Euro Be Crypto's Second Reserve? While they are increasing rapidly, euro stablecoins are still below 1% of all stablecoins worldwide, light-years behind USD-backed giants. But with the revival of the euro, MiCA regulatory clarity, and increasing demand for non-dollar-denominated assets, the time is now right for the euro to become crypto's second reserve currency. Market observers expect more innovation in euro-denominated DeFi, payments, and cross-border settlements with EURC and its rivals poised to take a larger slice of the digital money economy. Bottom Line The meteoric surge of the euro stablecoin market to $500 million is more than a news ticker headline—it's a harbinger of new global finance. With MiCA regulations kicking in and the euro growing in strength, euro-backed stablecoins are becoming increasingly popular as a solid contender to the dollar, poised to reshape the future of digital money and DeFi in Europe and beyond.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9738/euro-stablecoin-market-nears-500-m-outpaces-dollar-s-growth,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|USDT","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-06-27T19:50:25,"Bitcoin long-term holders added 800,000 BTC in a month, the highest ever recorded","Bitcoin long-term holders just locked in the biggest single-month accumulation ever recorded, grabbing 800,000 BTC in the span of 30 days, according to CryptoQuant. That figure is the highest monthly net growth in coins sitting untouched for more than six months, meaning they’ve now officially crossed into Long-Term Holder (LTH) status. And it’s not some bear-market bargain hunting either. These coins were bought when Bitcoin was trading between $95,000 and $107,000, with spot prices still holding above $100,000 today. The term “LTH” can get tricky. It’s not about addresses, it’s about the coin age. The moment a coin stays put for over 180 days, it’s categorized as long-term. So this isn’t just whales parking coins. It’s about how long those coins sit there, untouched. What we’re seeing now is a kind of quiet lock-in, with investors holding harder than they ever have before. This exact kind of accumulation spike has only shown up six times in Bitcoin’s 15-year history. ETFs and dolphins buy as megawhales back off Since May 9, Bitcoin has barely moved, sticking to a $10,000 range, even with a brief jump near $112,000, just above its previous high. That rally didn’t last. And it wasn’t for lack of interest. Over the last month, Bitcoin ETFs pulled in $3.5 billion across 12 straight trading sessions, making it their ninth week of inflows out of the last 11. But while the ETFs were stacking, the price barely moved. Why? Markus Thielen, head of 10x Research, explained it bluntly: “There is this change of ownership happening. We are not seeing a lot of real demand right now because the demand has been almost perfectly offset by the selling from these larger wallets.” In other words, the big early holders — the megawhales — are selling. But they’re doing it slowly, waiting for institutions like ETFs and corporate treasuries to absorb the supply. Julio Moreno, CryptoQuant’s research chief, said the real power buyers this year are wallets holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC, a group CryptoQuant calls dolphins. ETFs likely fall into that bracket. These aren’t retail investors or megawhales. They’re institutions spreading coins across many wallets. BlackRock, for example, operates around 550 wallets, averaging 1,290 BTC each. Strategy — the firm formerly known as MicroStrategy — controls 490 wallets, averaging 927 BTC each, based on 10x Research’s breakdown. Despite looking like mid-sized holders, these companies have stacked thousands of Bitcoin through their network of smaller wallets. Julio said, “In reality, these entities are in fact large holders, having purchased thousands of Bitcoin.” Chinese miners sit on five million coins as whales manage exit Meanwhile, the biggest Bitcoin holders ever, the early Chinese mining operations, are still in the picture. Between 2013 and 2021, China controlled up to 75% of the global hashrate, creating as much as 15 million BTC. Today, they still sit on at least five million of those coins. In every previous bull run, those dormant wallets would start dumping onto exchanges. Not this time. Thielen pointed out that these older wallets are only letting go of what ETFs and companies like Strategy are ready to take. “This time, so far, it seems that these wallets are holding – holding tight and only releasing as many Bitcoins as can be scooped up by ETFs and by Strategy,” he said. Still, not everyone’s buying like they were in 2024. Strategy has slowed its acquisition pace, thanks to tighter stock premiums and more competition from other companies moving Bitcoin onto their balance sheets. They’re still the biggest public buyer, but they’re not pushing as hard right now. The whale cohorts — wallets holding 1,000 to 10,000 BTC — and the megawhales holding more than that, have been net sellers in 2025. Retail wallets, those with less than 1 BTC, are also offloading. But as long as the dolphins keep buying faster than the whales sell, the market holds steady. If that flips, things stall out. “The imbalance creates a slight bearish bias,” Thielen said. “Making a breakout unlikely without a clear shift in our tactical flow indicator. Until that signal improves, consolidation is expected to continue.” KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-whales-make-history-with-800000-btc/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|RESEARCH","Bitcoin|BTC",cryptocompare
2025-06-27T19:43:09,"Bitcoin Bull Michael Saylor’s Company Strategy Hit with Multiple Lawsuits – Here’s the Critical Date","Bitcoin-focused investment firm Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) is facing at least five separate class-action lawsuits over $6 billion in unrealized Bitcoin losses, alleging the company made misleading statements to investors about the risks and profitability of Bitcoin. The initial lawsuit was filed by Pomerantz LLP on May 16. However, four other law firms — Gross Law Firm, Bronstein Gewirtz & Grossman, Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check and Levi & Korsinsky — have opted to file separate lawsuits with similar content rather than join the lawsuit. That’s not unusual, legal experts say. “In class-action securities litigation, law firms compete for the lead counsel role because that role can be very lucrative, with fees in the tens of millions of dollars,” said Adam Pritchard, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School. Related News: BREAKING: Donald Trump Comments on Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies Each of the lawsuits alleges that the company made “materially false and misleading” statements about the profitability and risks of Bitcoin investments between April 30, 2024 and April 4, 2025. Professor Ann Lipton of the University of Colorado School of Law similarly emphasized the importance of the lead plaintiff position, saying, “The lead plaintiff controls the litigation and determines the class attorneys. In cases that appear to be strong, many firms and plaintiffs file lawsuits to try their luck.” Law firms looking to get ahead in the litigation process are issuing public press releases inviting more investors to join the case. These statements often draw attention to the July 15 deadline, when the court will choose a lead plaintiff and the other cases will be consolidated under that umbrella. The primary goal of law firms, Pritchard says, is to include the most harmed investor among their plaintiffs. The Securities Private Litigation Reform Act of 1995 requires that the lead plaintiff role be given to the investor who suffered the most harm and volunteered to take on that role. Lipton sums it up this way: “An investor who has had more losses will monitor the case and the lawyers more carefully. That’s why institutional investors are generally preferred.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-27T19:40:03,"Staked Ether exceeds 30% of ETH total supply","Ethereum (ETH) is facing a mix of relatively low prices and increased usage. The network is carrying a near-record level of transactions, while over 30% of the supply is locked. Ethereum (ETH) keeps building up a supply crunch, based on whale holdings and increased staking. Currently, around 30% of the supply is staked, with highly active inflows in the past few months. More than 35M ETH is staked on the Beacon chain, an all-time high. The trend for staking may continue, as ETFs are also allowed to include staking for passive income. ETH staking picked up again in Q2, leading to a record value locked of over 35M ETH, or around 30% of the available supply. | Source: Beacon Chain After some outflows from the staking contract during the market panic in March and April, Ethereum staking returned to peak levels, not seen since September 2024. ETH staking became one of the most reliable markers for long-term confidence in the network’s value. Following the Pectra upgrade, staking also accelerated as large-scale whales could deposit more ETH at a time to build their stake. As a result, the total value staked on Ethereum is at an all-time high. The Ethereum network carries over $61B locked in DeFi protocols, including lending, liquid staking, and DEX liquidity pools. ETH remains valuable as collateral, and whales are in no hurry to sell. More ETH is wrapped in multiple protocols and is taken off the open market. Whales have also shown increased activity, adding on average 800K ETH per day for the previous week, while only 16K new ETH are produced each week. Whales are showing unprecedented levels of accumulation, boosting the narrative of a long-awaited price breakout. ETH exchange reserves remain scarce, at around 19M tokens. ETFs are also actively buying, with BlackRock recently absorbing the stake sold by Grayscale. ETH is also becoming attractive to corporate buyers as a collateral asset. The Ethereum network also awaits a new upgrade , which could further scale and speed up transactions. Despite the relatively high price compared to other networks, Ethereum remains a key platform for DeFi. Based on smart contract activity, the network’s main use cases are ETH transfers, while USDT and USDC remain some of the busiest smart contracts. ETH remains undervalued with volatile trading The current status of ETH is raising expectations for a catch-up rally. Trading under $2,500, ETH is seen as undervalued, despite the peak on-chain activity. Transactions have been climbing for Ethereum throughout 2025, reaching a higher baseline, with the occasional day of anomalous record activity. Despite this, the ETH market price remains close to its lows, still crashing after each breakout. In June, ETH failed to reclaim the $3,000 level. The token is down around 5% in June, though Q2 may end with significant net gains. ETH expanded by 31.8% in Q2, mostly driven by the peak gains in May. The multiple bullish factors for ETH are still not enough to spark a more decisive rally. In June, there is still an expectation for a breakout, where ETH can rally as high as $10,000. Even without a rally, Ethereum has shown it is not a dead chain. Recently, the network drew in over $334M in daily net inflows from bridges, as value returned to the biggest liquidity hub.
