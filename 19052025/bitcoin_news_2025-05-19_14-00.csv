2025-05-19T11:57:19.000Z,"Big News For XRP: This Company Just Applied for 3 XRP ETFs","Prominent crypto commentator Levi (@LeviRietveld) recently drew attention to a new filing relating to XRP, highlighting a registration by Volatility Shares Trust for XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) products. Levi shared his excitement on X, as he and the broader XRP community anticipate the launch of spot XRP ETFs. However, while Levi misidentified the ETF products, a recent Coindesk report shared more information, revealing that Volatility Shares has filed for a spot XRP ETF, a 2x leveraged XRP ETF, and a -1x inverse XRP ETF. More XRP ETF Applications Join the Race The registration indicates Volatility Shares’ intent to offer multiple forms of exposure to XRP, including direct tracking, enhanced upside, and short positioning. The spot ETF would directly follow the price of XRP, the 2x leveraged product aims to deliver twice the daily performance of XRP, and the inverse ETF would provide the opposite of XRP’s daily returns. These filings are part of a broader push by Volatility Shares to introduce cryptocurrency-based ETFs to the market. The company was previously the first to launch a 2x Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. and is now extending its lineup to include XRP. Teucrium, a known ETF issuer, recently gained approval for its 2x XRP ETF in the U.S. and has since disclosed that the product achieved the most successful ETF launch in the company’s history. This shows the significant demand and trading volume potential for XRP-related products. Volatility Shares’ products are intended to be listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, according to regulatory documents filed under Form 8-A12B on May 16, 2025.

Other applicants include Grayscale, Bitwise, WisdomTree, 21Shares, CoinShares, Canary Capital, and more than 70 other ETF applications are pending . While the U.S. market is waiting for the SEC, crypto markets worldwide are progressing. Brazil’s securities regulator has approved the world’s first spot XRP ETF . This development is mounting more pressure on U.S. regulators to authorize similar products domestically. What’s Next for XRP ETFs The market conditions surrounding XRP ETFs have evolved notably in 2025. The combination of international approvals and successful domestic launches provides a favorable backdrop for further expansion. Regulatory clarity around XRP has also improved following the settlement agreement between Ripple and the SEC. While both parties have faced a recent setback, experts believe the official resolution of the lawsuit will come soon , cementing XRP’s legal clarity and opening the door for institutional investment through ETFs and other products.

2025-05-19T11:49:01.000Z,"Australian court ruling could lead to $640M in Bitcoin tax refunds","A court decision in Australia could open the door to as much as $640 million in capital gains tax (CGT) refunds on Bitcoin transactions after a judge ruled that crypto should be treated as money rather than a taxable asset. On May 19, the Australian Financial Review (AFR) reported that the decision arose within a criminal case involving federal police officer William Wheatley, who allegedly stole 81.6 Bitcoin ( BTC ) in 2019. At the time, the assets were worth roughly $492,000. At current market prices, the tokens are valued at more than $13 million. In the case, Judge Michael O’Connell of Victoria ruled that Bitcoin qualifies as a form of money rather than property, likening the digital asset to Australian dollars rather than to shares, gold or foreign currency. The interpretation could set a legal precedent, potentially placing Bitcoin transactions outside the scope of Australia’s current CGT regime. New court ruling challenges Australian crypto tax laws In an AFR interview, tax lawyer Adrian Cartland said the verdict “totally upends” the Australian Taxation Office’s (ATO) current position. Since 2014, the ATO has classified crypto assets as CGT assets. This means that users must pay tax when selling or trading them. Under the ATO’s guidance, any disposal of Bitcoin, including selling it for fiat, exchanging it for another crypto or using it to purchase goods or services, constitutes a CGT event. This framework has been the basis for taxing cryptocurrency transactions in Australia for over a decade. However, the recent ruling challenges the approach by suggesting that Bitcoin functions more like money than property. This potentially exempts it from CGT. Related: Australian feds seize mansion, Bitcoin allegedly linked to crypto exchange hack Tax refunds could reach $640 million Cartland said it was held that Bitcoin is Australian money. “That is, it is not a CGT asset. Therefore, acquisitions and disposals of Bitcoin have no tax consequences,” the tax lawyer added. If the ruling is upheld on the appeal, Cartland estimates that there could be potential tax refunds totalling 1 billion Australian dollars ($640 million). However, while Cartland thinks there could be up to a billion in refunds, the ATO said there were no official figures that confirm the amount to be potentially refunded if the case changes how Bitcoin is taxed in Australia.

2025-05-19T11:45:31.000Z,"Trump Administration To Slash Banking Rules Designed To Prevent 2008-Style Collapse: Report","The US government is reportedly gearing up to announce a rollback in banking regulations that will provide financial institutions with looser capital requirements. President Trump’s administration is preparing to announce a reduction in the supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) for US banks’ capital reserves, the Financial Times (FT) reports , citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. Regulators originally implemented the current SLR rules as part of Basel III in 2014, aiming to prevent a repeat of the 2008-2009 Global Financial Crisis. But some have argued that the regulations hold back the market and the financial industry. Says Greg Baer, head of the Bank Policy Institute lobby group, “Penalizing banks for holding low-risk assets like Treasuries undermines their ability to support market liquidity during times of stress when it is most needed… Regulators should act now rather than waiting for the next event.” Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell also said earlier this year that he believed dialing back the SLR would “strongly” help support the US Treasury market. “We need to work on Treasury market structure, and part of that answer can be, and I think will be, reducing the calibration of the supplemental leverage ratio.” But others don’t share the same sentiment. Nicolas Véron, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, tells the FT that given the current risks for US banks and the role of the dollar and the direction of the economy, now is not the right time to relax capital standards. Under Basel III, systemically important banks (SIBs) in the United States are required to maintain a supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of 5% or more at the holding company level and 6% at the insured depository institution level. Meanwhile, many other developed countries adhere to the Basel III minimum SLR of 3%, though some jurisdictions have proposed or implemented slightly higher standards ranging from 3.5% to 4.25% FT’s sources did not specify what precise SLR percentage regulators are aiming for, but lobbyists say they would like to bring America’s requirements more in line with international standards.

2025-05-19T11:31:41.000Z,"Australian federal police seizes $4.5M in assets tied to 2013 crypto theft","Australian authorities have seized more than $4.5 million in assets from a Queensland man, who was linked to the 2013 theft of 950 BTC from a French crypto exchange. In a May 18 statement , AFP-led Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce said that more than $4.5 million worth of assets—including a waterfront mansion in Queensland, a luxury vehicle, and nearly 25 Bitcoin ( BTC )—have been forfeited to the Commonwealth, following an investigation into the suspected proceeds of a major international crypto theft dating back to 2013. The forfeiture was ordered by the District Court of Queensland back in April this year, culminating a years-long probe into stolen digital assets and cybercrime involving a Queensland man previously convicted of hacking a U.S.-based gaming company. The man, whose identity has not been publicly disclosed in this announcement, was also linked to the theft of 950 BTC from a French crypto exchange in 2013. While no criminal charges were filed in this specific case, Australian authorities used the Proceeds of Crime Act to pursue the assets under civil forfeiture laws, which do not require a criminal conviction. The investigation, known as Operation Gouldian, began in September 2018 after AUSTRAC—the Australian financial intelligence agency—received information from law enforcement in Luxembourg about suspicious BTC transactions. This triggered a deeper probe into the individual’s financial activity, which ultimately revealed a massive gap between the man’s apparent wealth and any identifiable legitimate income. By July 2023, the CACT had secured restraining orders over several assets believed to be funded through criminal means, including a 2019 black Mercedes Benz sedan, a waterfront property in Beachmere, and 24.99454224 BTC. Federal agents later executed search warrants at the Beachmere property, strengthening the case for forfeiture.

From there, they may be allocated by the Attorney-General to support crime prevention initiatives, law enforcement programs, and efforts targeting the illicit drug trade and related social harms. The Queensland forfeiture adds to a growing list of recent cases where proceeds from crypto thefts were used to fund lavish lifestyles. For example, last week, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted 12 more individuals in a $263 million crypto fraud case, revealing that the illicit gains were spent on luxury vehicles, jewelry, and designer goods.

Once seen as a rocket fueled by internet hype and retail dreams, Bitcoin ( BTC ) may be settling into a slower, more mature phase as large investors step in, analyst Willy Woo says. In a recent post on X, Woo questioned the idea of Bitcoin’s limitless growth, saying “people think BTC is like a magical unicorn that climbs to infinity on moonbeams.” He pointed to a chart showing that the triple-digit annual gains seen in 2017 have since faded, suggesting those days may be behind us. People think BTC is like a magical unicorn that climbs to infinity on moonbeams. Here's the actual CAGR chart. We are well past the 2017 year where we'd see many 100s of percent growth.

Data from Bitcoin Treasuries shows that private and public companies, ETFs, and governments collectively hold nearly 3 million BTC as of May. After accounting for an estimated 3.5 million lost coins, this represents about 18.75% of Bitcoin’s effective circulating supply.

Despite the slowing growth, Woo remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term prospects, encouraging investors to “enjoy the ride” for the next 15 to 20 years, noting that few publicly investable assets can match Bitcoin’s performance over the long term, even as its compound annual growth rate gradually declines.

2025-05-19T11:30:00.000Z,"Bitcoin Fees Hit 2025 High as Corporate Buys Draw Scrutiny","Bitcoin’s growing presence on corporate balance sheets is prompting mixed reactions across markets. As transaction fees on the Bitcoin network hit their highest levels of 2025, Singapore-based Basel Medical Group announced plans to purchase $1 billion worth of the cryptocurrency through a share-swap arrangement. The move, intended to strengthen its financial position and support future acquisitions, was met with skepticism from investors, sending the company’s stock down 15%. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s rising fees reflect renewed demand for its blockspace, even as daily transaction volume declines. Bitcoin Transaction Fees Rise as Price Pushes Toward $106K, Despite Slowing Activity Bitcoin (BTC) continues to capture market attention in May 2025, as its price briefly touched a new local high of nearly $106,000 before retreating slightly to around $104,500. While traders welcomed the surge, they also took note of a corresponding rise in transaction fees, which is a signal that demand for Bitcoin's blockspace is once again heating up. According to recent data, the seven-day moving average of transaction fees on the Bitcoin network has climbed steadily since early May, reaching a 2025 high of $2.40. That marks a roughly $1 increase over just a couple of weeks. The growing fees are often seen as an indicator of increased network congestion and heightened competition for block inclusion, especially as Bitcoin’s price surges. Curiously, the fee increase isn’t being driven by a higher transaction count. In fact, the average number of daily transactions has been falling. Data shows that Bitcoin handled around 507,000 transactions on April 22, a figure that has since dropped more than 35% to approximately 330,000 daily transactions. This inverse correlation—higher fees despite fewer transactions—suggests that the transactions being processed may be larger, more complex, or more urgent, driving users to pay higher fees to ensure prompt confirmations. It also points to renewed activity from institutions or major holders willing to pay a premium to move funds during price rallies. Bitcoin Dominance Reclaims Ground Bitcoin's market dominance, the metric that compares BTC’s market cap to that of the entire crypto ecosystem, has rebounded in recent days following a slight pullback earlier in the month. This recovery suggests that the dip in Bitcoin’s value relative to altcoins was more likely a result of temporary liquidity imbalances than a fundamental pivot toward an ”altcoin season.” Bitcoin dominance chart (Source: CoinMarketCap ) The latest bounceback in dominance signals that investors are still leaning heavily into Bitcoin during periods of volatility, affirming its status as the market’s most stable digital asset and primary store of value. One of the more bullish signals for Bitcoin comes from Glassnode’s data on illiquid supply. The amount of BTC held in wallets with little to no spending history has hit an all-time high, reducing the liquid supply available on exchanges. This tightening supply dynamic is key. With less Bitcoin available for immediate trade and rising demand spurred by both institutional interest and macroeconomic uncertainty, any continued inflows could rapidly tip the scales toward a supply shock. That scenario could drive prices even higher as buyers compete for a shrinking pool of tradable BTC. This trend reinforces a recurring theme in Bitcoin market cycles: HODLing behavior intensifies in anticipation of further gains, leaving less room for new buyers unless they’re willing to pay a premium. What’s Behind the Rally? Several factors appear to be fueling Bitcoin’s current rally. Renewed institutional interest, continued inflationary pressures in traditional economies, and growing concerns over global debt levels have made hard-capped digital assets more attractive. Additionally, geopolitical tensions and recent US Treasury discussions about expanding digital dollar research may be helping BTC find support as a decentralized alternative to state-issued currencies. And while the altcoin market has seen periodic excitement, Bitcoin remains the benchmark asset for those looking to hedge against macroeconomic instability. With transaction fees on the rise and network congestion mounting, the Bitcoin ecosystem may soon be tested again. Developers are watching closely for signals of renewed spam activity. particularly from inscriptions and Ordinals, that could artificially inflate network use. At the same time, increased fee revenues are welcomed by miners, especially following the recent halving which slashed block rewards. For now, the combination of surging illiquid supply, rising fees, and rebounding dominance presents a compelling setup for Bitcoin bulls. If liquidity continues flowing in and retail investors return in force, the case for a sustained push beyond $106,000 becomes more plausible. Yet caution is warranted. The divergence between price and transaction volume introduces potential volatility, especially if speculative activity returns to the market without fundamental support. As always in crypto, sentiment can shift quickly. Basel Medical Group Shares Fall 15% After Announcing $1B Bitcoin Treasury Purchase In other Bitcoin news, Basel Medical Group has become the latest public company to bet big on BTC, announcing plans to acquire $1 billion worth of the cryptocurrency for its corporate treasury. But the news has triggered a sharp sell-off, with shares of the Singapore-based healthcare provider plunging nearly 15% in intraday trading on May 16, according to Google Finance data. Basel Medical’s shares down 15% on May 16 (Source: Google Finance ) The market’s reaction suggests that while Bitcoin may be gaining traction as a treasury asset among corporations, shareholder skepticism remains high, particularly when the pivot comes from firms outside the tech or financial sectors. In a statement issued on May 16, Basel Medical said it is in “advanced discussions with a consortium of institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals” to acquire $1 billion in Bitcoin through a “novel share-swap arrangement.” The deal, the company claims, will significantly strengthen its balance sheet and enhance its ability to pursue mergers and acquisitions across Asia’s rapidly expanding healthcare sector. The Bitcoin allocation, Basel says, is designed to “establish a diversified asset base to weather market volatility” and provide “unmatched financial flexibility” amid ongoing expansion plans. Yet shareholders were far from reassured. Following the announcement, shares of Basel Medical Group (ticker: BMGL) fell precipitously, erasing over $150 million in market capitalization by midday. The sell-off mirrors other recent episodes where investors responded negatively to similar Bitcoin treasury announcements, casting doubt on whether corporate BTC strategies can win broad investor approval. Strategic Play or Risky Gamble? Basel Medical’s bold move is part of a broader strategy to fuel inorganic growth. Just last month, the firm acquired Bethesda Medical, a regional peer, in a move touted as “the beginning of Basel Medical Group’s expansion strategy in Singapore and the broader Southeast Asian healthcare market.” CEO Darren Chhoa defended the Bitcoin treasury pivot, calling it a cornerstone of the company’s M&A roadmap. “Our expanded balance sheet will allow us to move quickly on strategic opportunities as we build a premier healthcare platform across high-growth Asian markets,” Chhoa said. Still, market observers remain divided on the wisdom of merging Bitcoin speculation with healthcare operations. While some hail the move as visionary, others question whether volatile crypto assets belong on the books of a traditionally conservative industry like healthcare. Basel isn’t the first company to see its stock punished after announcing plans to buy Bitcoin. In March, GameStop lost almost $3 billion in market value in a single day after revealing its own plans to adopt a Bitcoin treasury model. Investors reacted with confusion, wondering whether the struggling video game retailer was losing strategic focus. “There are question marks with GameStop's model,” eToro US investment analyst Bret Kenwell told Reuters at the time. “If bitcoin is going to be the pivot, where does that leave everything else?” Despite the pushback, Bitcoin treasuries continue to grow. According to BitcoinTreasuries.net, corporations now hold approximately $80 billion worth of BTC on their balance sheets. Early adopters like Strategy and Tesla have helped blaze the trail, with Strategy in particular using convertible debt and equity offerings to accumulate over $13 billion in Bitcoin. Bitcoin treasury metrics (Source: Bitcointreasuries.net ) Financial institutions are also becoming more open to the idea. In a 2024 report, Fidelity Digital Assets noted that Bitcoin could serve as a “valuable hedge against growing fiscal deficits, currency debasement, and geopolitical risks”—a view increasingly shared by macro investors amid uncertain global conditions. A Crypto Hedge for Healthcare? For Basel Medical, the rationale appears rooted in a desire to gain financial leverage without taking on traditional debt. The share-swap model being discussed could allow the company to issue new shares in exchange for Bitcoin from private investors, thereby acquiring the asset without immediate cash outflows. In theory, this would provide Basel with an appreciating reserve asset that could be liquidated or borrowed against in future acquisitions. But such a strategy depends heavily on Bitcoin’s continued upward trajectory, an assumption not all shareholders are willing to bet on. Moreover, critics argue that using shareholder capital to accumulate crypto risks undermining investor confidence in the firm’s core business. For a company operating in healthcare, where predictability and risk management are paramount, adding a volatile digital asset to the treasury could be perceived as reckless. The Basel news comes at a time when Bitcoin itself is on the rise, recently trading just above $104,000. As macroeconomic uncertainties mount and fiat currencies face growing scrutiny, more companies may consider Bitcoin exposure as a strategic asset. But as this week’s sell-off shows, the market is still drawing a line between financial innovation and speculative overreach.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9168/bitcoin-fees-hit-2025-high-as-corporate-buys-draw-scrutiny,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

Announcing the prediction for the highly anticipated altcoin season, Arthur Hayes said that the altcoin season is expected to occur this summer or early in the third quarter. When Will Altcoin Season Begin? Speaking to Fortuna, Hayes explained his predictions about Bitcoin and altcoins, as well as curiosities about his portfolio. Hayes stated that he also invested in gold apart from cryptocurrencies at this point and said that gold constitutes approximately 20% of his personal investment portfolio. He argued that for the expected altcoin season, Bitcoin must first surpass $110,000 and climb to between $150,000 and $200,000 with increasing trading volume. He said he expects this growth in BTC to likely occur this summer or early in the third quarter. According to Hayes, when Bitcoin reaches these levels, the altcoin season will also begin. However, Hayes stated that this altcoin season will not be like the 2021 super cycle, where each altcoin increased 100 times, and warned investors against some altcoins. According to Hayes, older altcoins with high fully diluted valuations (FDV), low circulating supply, low user base, and low revenue are unlikely to perform well in this cycle. Ethereum Will Surpass Solana! Hayes also said that ETH has stronger upside potential than Solana, citing Ethereum’s high total value locked (TVL), robust developer ecosystem, and position as the most secure proof-of-stake blockchain. Hayes, who acknowledged that Solana has seen a tremendous rise from $7 to $170, said that despite this rise, he expects ETH to perform better in the upcoming bull market. Bitcoin Price Prediction! Finally, Hayes, who also announced his Bitcoin price prediction, estimates that Bitcoin will reach $1 million before Trump's term ends and approximately $250,000 by the end of 2025. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-19T11:15:12.000Z,"US crypto funds top $7.5B inflows in 2025 as investor appetite grows","Crypto investment products in the United States have attracted over $7.5 billion worth of investment in 2025, with a fifth week of net positive inflows last week signaling growing investor demand for digital assets. US-based crypto investment products attracted $785 million worth of investment last week, pushing the year-to-date (YTD) total to over $7.5 billion, according to a May 19 report by digital asset manager CoinShares. The latest figure marks the fifth consecutive week of net positive flows, following nearly $7 billion in outflows during February and March. Weekly crypto asset flows, USD, million. Source: CoinShares The United States accounted for the bulk of inflows, with $681 million, followed by Germany at $86.3 million and Hong Kong at $24.4 million. Crypto flows by country. Source: CoinShares Investor demand for risk assets such as cryptocurrencies staged a significant recovery after the White House announced a 90-day pause on additional tariffs on May 12, which marked a 24% cut for import tariffs for both the US and China. A day after the announcement, Coinbase exchange saw 9,739 Bitcoin ( BTC ) worth more than $1 billion withdrawn from the exchange — the highest net outflow recorded in 2025, signaling that institutional appetite was “accelerating,” according to Bitwise head of European research, André Dragosch. Related: Tether surpasses Germany’s $111B of US Treasury holdings Ethereum leads with $205 million in weekly inflows Ether ( ETH ) was the top performer among crypto investment products, attracting $205 million in inflows last week. That brings its year-to-date total to more than $575 million. The report attributed the $200 million to renewed investor optimism following the successful Pectra upgrade and the appointment of new co-executive director Tomasz Stańczak. After initial delays, Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade went live on the mainnet on May 7, introducing improvements such as higher staking limits and account abstraction via EIP-7702. By contrast, Solana ( SOL ) investment products were the only major assets to see net outflows, with $890,000 withdrawn over the past week.

2025-05-19T11:11:06.000Z,"New Bitcoin All-Time High Next ot Painful Correction? Analyst Weighs In","Bitcoin (BTC) has arrived at a crossroads after its recent rally past $106,000. Market participants are speculating whether the digital asset will see more momentum to register new highs or retrace a bit to cool off. A tweet thread by market expert Ali Martinez has outlined factors that could contribute to bitcoin’s surge or correction in the coming days. He believes the cryptocurrency will eventually hit an all-time high, but it remains unclear if the asset will experience a correction first. Will BTC Surge or Retrace? According to Martinez, BTC has hit a critical resistance zone around $107,000 after rallying at least 42% in the past month. This region has historically been a turning point for past rallies, as seen in December and January. The analyst insists a daily close above $107,000 will provide the push BTC needs to reach new highs, but until that happens, market participants remain patient. While the wait continues, the Bitcoin Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows that momentum is stretched, and the asset has climbed into overbought territory since May 15. A surge into this zone has always preceded short-term corrections. This means BTC may be due for a brief retrace, especially with the RSI signalling overbought conditions. Additionally, BTC whales have been realizing profits . This significant profit taking is evident in this cohort of market participants selling more than 30,000 BTC since May 13. Such levels of profit taking usually increase selling pressure and trigger notable declines in the price of an asset. Major Support And Resistance Zones Martinez said BTC could fall to the support zone between $95,850 and $98,730 if selling pressure from investors increases. At least 1.19 million wallets have accumulated more than one million BTC at $98,732, making that level a major demand zone. The asset could see an even deeper correction if BTC falls below this support region. However, if BTC holds above the support range, the asset could consolidate and amass momentum for its next leg up. From there, $116,900 is the next major target. So, Bitcoin pricing bands show $98,131 and $116,900 as key support and resistance levels for BTC over the following weeks. Meanwhile, the leading cryptocurrency has been consolidating over the last few days, and was changing hands around $103,000 at the time of writing.

2025-05-19T11:05:40.000Z,"Expert On How XRP Price Could React After CME Futures Launch","The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) is launching XRP futures today, May 19. This development represents a major step for XRP’s market maturity and has attracted attention from institutional and retail investors alike. Trader and XRP analyst Aj Allen offered insights on how this event could influence short-term price action, drawing from historical data and professional trading behavior. XRP Futures Explained: Institutional Appeal and Trading Mechanics CME’s XRP futures are cash-settled, meaning the contracts are resolved in fiat currency rather than actual asset delivery. This format enables market participants to speculate on XRP’s price without holding it. It also appeals to institutions that seek exposure to digital assets without dealing with custody or regulatory complexities. Traders can take long positions if they expect prices to increase or short positions if they predict a decline. While retail investors may focus on directional trades, institutional players tend to apply advanced strategies, including arbitrage and hedging. How Much Could XRP React to This Launch? Allen referenced previous Futures rollouts as case studies. When CME introduced Bitcoin futures in December 2017, Bitcoin surged to a record high near $20,000. However, the price dropped roughly 30% within days, which coincided with the broader market peaking during that bull cycle. Similarly, when Ethereum futures began trading on the CBOE in February 2018, ETH dropped from approximately $1,400 to $1,100 shortly after. These examples suggest that futures launches, while often preceded by bullish speculation, may be followed by sharp declines as traders take profits or enter short positions. XRP holders should also prepare for something similar. Institutional Strategies and Market Volatility Allen explained that professional traders frequently use basis trading to capitalize on the difference between futures and spot prices. When futures trade at a premium to the spot price (a condition known as contango), investors may short futures and purchase the underlying asset. In contrast, if futures trade below the spot price (backwardation), they may buy futures and short the spot market. These actions help align prices but can also contribute to short-term volatility. Furthermore, futures contracts serve as risk management tools. Investors holding XRP may use futures to hedge their positions, especially during market uncertainty, by taking offsetting positions that reduce potential losses. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Anticipation surrounding the Futures launch has led to expectations of a potential price increase. However, based on previous market behaviour observed with Bitcoin and Ethereum, a corrective phase could follow the initial uptick. Allen notes that the impact will ultimately depend on institutional engagement, trading volume, and market liquidity. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.31, reflecting a 3.10% decrease in the past 24 hours. The token remains approximately 40% below its historical peak, indicating room for both upward movement and further volatility. Potential Long-Term Implications Beyond immediate price considerations, the launch of XRP futures may improve the asset’s prospects for a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF). Analysts from Bloomberg have previously indicated that having a CFTC-regulated futures product in place is a key factor the SEC evaluates when approving spot ETFs. This was the case with Bitcoin and Ethereum, which had regulated futures markets before receiving approval for spot ETFs in 2024. As the market adapts to this new derivative offering, observers will watch closely to see whether XRP follows a pattern similar to its predecessors and how this development might shape its role in the digital asset space.

2025-05-19T10:54:57.000Z,"Bitcoin Pepe may gain traction as CME launches XRP Futures ETF","XRP and other cryptocurrencies remain in focus ahead of CME’s launch of the XRP Futures ETF on Monday, which is being touted as a major milestone for digital assets at large. Investors are convinced that the launch of XRP Futures ETF will help boost institutional demand for Ripple’s native coin. Additionally, the futures exchange-traded fund is also being seen as a potential catalyst that could pave the way for the US Securities and Exchange Commission to eventually approve the pending applications for Spot XRP ETFs as well. All in all, these developments are broadly expected to help improve the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies over the next few years. According to lawyer Bill Morgan: These are futures contracts. Do you know what that means for demand for XRP? Aren’t these cash-settled futures contracts? And this institutional demand and mainstream adoption of XRP could have a trickle-down effect on other crypto assets and meme coins like Bitcoin Pepe as well. Retail investors could turn to meme coins as CME launches XRP Futures ETF The launch of XRP Futures ETF today marks a significant milestone for the broader crypto market. Institutional adoption of Ripple’s native coin through futures contracts signals growing confidence in digital assets, which could extend to speculative tokens. Historically, major crypto developments, such as Bitcoin ETFs launch, have triggered increased liquidity and investor interest in altcoins and meme coins in the succeeding weeks and months. With institutions potentially turning to XRP on the back of CME’s futures exchange-traded fund, meme coins built on other established networks, like Bitcoin Pepe and Puffer, could benefit from heightened market enthusiasm as well. Investors seeking high-risk, high-reward opportunities may turn to these meme coins as a way to capitalise on the broader crypto rally. Additionally, the legitimization of XRP through an ETF could pave the way for similar financial products for meme coins in the future, further integrating them into the traditional financial ecosystem. What makes Bitcoin Pepe a particularly exciting investment for 2025 Bitcoin Pepe stands to particularly benefit from the launch of an XRP Futures ETF as it combines Bitcoin’s security with the viral appeal of meme culture. Built on the Bitcoin blockchain using the BRC-20 token standard, decentralisation and scarcity sit right at the heart of Bitcoin Pepe, making it an intriguing asset for investors in 2025. Unlike many meme coins that rely on Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain, Bitcoin Pepe leverages Bitcoin’s robust infrastructure, ensuring greater security and resilience. Its fixed supply model enhances scarcity, potentially driving long-term value. Additionally, Bitcoin Pepe fosters a strong community-driven ecosystem, where holders actively participate in shaping its future. While meme coins are often dismissed as speculative assets, Bitcoin Pepe’s integration with Bitcoin’s blockchain gives it a unique edge, positioning it as a potential leader in the next wave of meme coin adoption.

Built on Bitcoin’s BRC-20 standard, the project introduces a new PEP-20 token format that merges internet meme culture with Bitcoin infrastructure. Since launch, it has raised more than $9.4 million, burned its liquidity pool tokens, and renounced contract ownership – moves that have attracted retail investors looking for community-led, low-tax tokens in the altcoin space. The coin’s supply is capped at 420,690,000,000 tokens, with 0% transaction taxes. Its rise comes amid renewed interest in meme coins, driven by strong performances from Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Bonk, and others. With no central control and a meme-powered narrative, Bitcoin Pepe is rapidly gaining attention as one of the best cryptos to buy in the current market cycle.

Dogecoin, the original meme token, spiked by 12.7% in a single day in April. Shiba Inu closed 2024 up 105%, while Pepe Coin and Bonk saw major gains in May trading. Retail investors are once again piling into high-risk, high-reward assets as social media sentiment drives speculative interest across the altcoin market. But Bitcoin Pepe offers something new. Most meme coins are based on Ethereum or Solana. In contrast, Bitcoin Pepe is natively built on Bitcoin, tapping into its security while aiming to recreate the fast, low-fee environment of Solana through its proposed PEP-20 upgrade. It positions itself as a scalable, decentralised meme project with no taxes, a fair launch, and deep meme credibility – thanks to its “Pepe meets Bitcoin” branding. With an exchange listing expected by 31 May, Bitcoin Pepe has a clear roadmap and an active base of holders and Twitter followers ready to support the next leg of growth.

Comparing Bitcoin Pepe with Dogecoin, Bonk, and Sponge V2 Bitcoin Pepe is not the only meme coin drawing attention in 2025. Dogecoin, with a market cap of over $25 billion, continues to dominate the space. Its high liquidity and cultural relevance, bolstered by Elon Musk’s intermittent support, make it a safer bet for conservative meme investors. However, Dogecoin’s unlimited supply and slower blockchain limit its upside compared to newer projects like BPEP. Bonk, a meme coin built on Solana, has seen a revival thanks to its developer activity and validator partnerships. It boasts low fees and a large user base but lacks the novel BRC-20 angle Bitcoin Pepe is bringing to the space. Bonk’s growth is stabilising after its rapid early-year rise. Sponge V2, a relaunch of the popular Sponge token, blends staking rewards with play-to-earn mechanics. The project has over 5 billion tokens staked and an active gaming roadmap, but remains confined to the small-cap segment. Its upside depends on game development success, while Bitcoin Pepe offers broader appeal via its Bitcoin-based launch and meme branding. Among these, Bitcoin Pepe stands out for being the only major meme coin leveraging Bitcoin’s blockchain, offering a fresh angle to a familiar concept. Its technical ambition, paired with humorous branding, positions it uniquely in the meme coin resurgence.

2025-05-19T10:39:01.000Z,"Metaplanet inches toward 2025 goal with fresh 1004 BTC purchase","Japan’s Metaplanet has acquired over 1,000 Bitcoin as part of its ongoing treasury strategy, bringing it within striking distance of its year-end target. According to a May 19 announcement , the Tokyo-listed firm purchased 1,004 BTC for around ¥15.2 billion ($104.6 million), marking one of its largest single-day acquisitions to date. The average purchase price for the latest batch stood at ¥15,134,304 per Bitcoin. It also raised Metaplanet’s average cost basis to ¥13.5 million per Bitcoin. The company now holds 7,800 BTC in total, up from 6,796 BTC on May 12. At current market prices, its holdings are worth an estimated $807 million. It is the second-largest Bitcoin purchase in Metaplanet’s history, following its 1,241 BTC acquisition on May 12. That earlier buy had pushed the company past El Salvador in total corporate Bitcoin holdings. Metaplanet’s BTC Yield, a metric it uses to track the growth in Bitcoin per fully diluted share, rose to 47.8% for the second quarter as of May 19. The firm had previously reported BTC Yields of 95.6% for Q1 2025 and 309.8% for Q4 2024. Closing in on the yearly target Metaplanet plans to acquire 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025 and 21,000 BTC by the end of 2026, which represents 1% of Bitcoin’s total fixed supply. With 7,800 BTC already in reserve, it has now crossed the 75% mark toward this year’s goal. Since launching its Bitcoin Treasury Operations as an official business unit in December 2024, Metaplanet has significantly ramped up its buying activity. In April alone, it made four purchases totalling 794 BTC, followed by 2,800 BTC acquired in the first 19 days of May. Metaplanet’s aggressive strategy To fund these acquisitions, the firm has leaned heavily on capital market instruments rather than operational cash flows. Its latest purchase was backed by proceeds from bond issuances and stock acquisition rights, continuing a pattern established since early 2024. Specifically, Metaplanet has issued a series of zero-coupon, non-interest-bearing bonds to EVO FUND, its financial backer. Since January, these offerings have raised billions of yen and several million dollars, with many repaid early using funds generated from equity conversion. As part of this financing mechanism, the company has exercised multiple tranches of stock acquisition rights, issuing tens of millions of new shares. These rights are structured with no discount and include provisions to adjust pricing based on market conditions, aligning with U.S.-style ATM equity facilities. Corporate Bitcoin buying on the rise Metaplanet’s latest acquisition came as BTC was trading roughly 3% below its all-time high, joining a broader wave of corporate accumulation seen this year. U.S.-based Strategy , the largest public holder of Bitcoin, recently snapped up 13,390 BTC for $1.34 billion, boosting its total stash to 568,840 BTC. Around the same time, Twenty One Capital, a new venture backed by SoftBank, Tether , and Cantor Fitzgerald, entered the market with an initial allocation of 42,000 BTC, vaulting into the top three corporate holders. Smaller players have also joined the fray. Medical tech firm Semler Scientific added over 1,100 BTC in Q1 and filed to raise $500 million for further purchases. Meanwhile, Next Technology Holding has revealed it had accumulated 5,833 BTC, with most of the buys made in 2025.

2025-05-19T10:30:54.000Z,"Bitcoin May Kill The Satoshi: Jack Dorsey Sparks Controversy","Bitcoin’s smallest named unit, the satoshi, is suddenly on the defensive after Block Inc. chief executive Jack Dorsey publicly endorsed scrapping it in favour of calling every indivisible integer of the network simply “bitcoin.” On Sunday the former Twitter CEO reposted a remark by “grubles” and added his own assessment: “sats are so confusing to people just getting into bitcoin. bits of bitcoin is better, and just bitcoin is best.” Dorsey ’s interjection came in response to grubles who argued that “‘Sats’ are technically bitcoin. So it’s not incorrect to just stop calling them sats and just call them bitcoin again.” One critic replied that the discussion showed that “people have nothing else to worry about,” to which Dorsey shot back: “I’m very worried about Bitcoin becoming money. It must.” Proposal To Ditch Satoshis As Bitcoin’s Base Unit The immediate backdrop is the improvement proposal 177 (BIP 177) , introduced on 23 April by Synonym CEO and developer John Carvalho. The document would “redefine the commonly recognized ‘bitcoin’ unit so that the base unit becomes the primary reference unit,” eliminating the customary eight-decimal presentation and deprecating the term “satoshi.” Internally nothing changes; what users now know as 1 BTC would display as 100 000 000 bitcoins, while wallets could offer a legacy toggle for backwards compatibility. Carvalho argues that imposing an integer-only view cleans up education and user interfaces by exposing the protocol’s true nature: “Bitcoin’s ledger represents values as integral base units. The decimal point is merely a human-imposed abstraction.” Supporters say that ditching decimals removes the psychological hurdle that drives newcomers to cheaper-looking altcoins and that the move resembles a “stock split” rather than a monetary debasement. Resistance has been fierce. Swan chief executive Cory Klippsten, Byte Federal product director Michelle Weekley and consultant Magdalena Gronowska all warn that multiplying apparent supply from 21 million to 2.1 quadrillion “bitcoins” would sow chaos. Weekley counters that “people understand cents in a dollar, they will understand sats in a Bitcoin,” while Gronowska fears some users “could think that Bitcoin abruptly crashed from its current price of around $100,000 and that its supply has massively inflated.” Robin Linus, creator of the Bitcoin Virtual Machine (BVM), notes that the currency’s pseudonymous inventor anticipated such a shift. In a 6 February 2010 Bitcointalk post , Satoshi Nakamoto wrote: “If it gets tiresome working with small numbers, we could change where the display shows the decimal point… Same amount of money, just different convention.” The denomination debate is hardly new: Jimmy Song’s 2017 BIP 176 proposed “bits” (one-millionth of a BTC) as a friendlier frontage, but Carvalho dismisses that as retaining a “layered decimal approach” and “shifting complexity rather than eliminating it.” No Bitcoin consensus-critical change has been activated since the Taproot soft fork in November 2021, and BIP 177 would likewise require only interface, not protocol, updates—yet a norm change still depends on widespread voluntary adoption by wallets, exchanges and payment processors. For now the market shows little concern.

The retreat sparked warnings that the market could pierce the psychologically important $100,000 mark if buyers fail to defend near-term support. Divergence hints at trend reversal Technical analysts flagged a lower high in the relative strength index versus a higher price high, a classic sign of waning momentum. Chartist Bluntz cautioned traders to “be careful with [placing] longs” until the signal plays out or is invalidated by a strong rebound.

Key zones come into view Volume-profile data identifies $97,000–$98,500 as heavy support if the immediate $101,500–$102,500 floor dissolves. Failure there would open the way to a potential inverse head-and-shoulders retest around $91,000, where the 50-period EMA sits on the three-day chart. Such a move would echo reversals seen in December 2024 and January 2025, when repeated rejections at the $107,000 neckline preceded sizable drawdowns. Longer-term outlook intact Despite near-term weakness, the broader structure still points to a possible surge toward $150,000 once consolidation completes and the neckline flips to support. Macro drivers, including Moody’s weekend downgrade of U.S. sovereign credit, have added stress to risk assets but could ultimately aid Bitcoin if dollar softness persists. Derivatives markets show funding rates resetting toward neutral, suggesting leverage has been flushed and setting the stage for a healthier advance when momentum returns. For now, bulls must prove their resilience by preventing a decisive daily close beneath $100,000, or risk ceding control to short sellers eyeing deeper value zones.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/bears-test-bitcoin-support-after-sharp-intraday-slide-90000-in-play/,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|RESEARCH","Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence",cryptocompare

2025-05-19T10:12:50.000Z,"Monday madness; Crypto market wipes $100 billion in a day","Last weekend featured exceptional volatility and ended with a massive downturn as the one-day cryptocurrency market valuation revealed a $100 billion crash by the morning of Monday, May 19. Late on Sunday, the digital assets market capitalization climbed to a high of $3.32 trillion, only to crash by more than $110 billion to $3.2 trillion at press time. The collapse aligns with the moves observed in the last week, especially in the previous three days, per the data retrieved from TradingView. Total cryptocurrency market valuation one-day chart. Source: TradingView At the start of Saturday, May 17, the total crypto market cap stood at $3.25 trillion, only to drop by $40 billion to $3.21 trillion within hours. After a day of sideways trading, digital assets soared more than $100 billion, then created a ravine as they fully corrected before rallying once again on Sunday ahead of the latest plunge. Total cryptocurrency market valuation one-week chart. Source: TradingView Why the crypto market erased $100 billion in a day At press time on May 19, there appeared to be two main reasons for the volatility and downturn. The first involved the world’s premier cryptocurrency, Bitcoin ( BTC ), as it attempted and failed to find a footing above $105,000 after its highest weekly close in history. The seven-day chart for BTC shows two strong upswings over the weekend, with one crossing above $105,000 and the other moving even higher above $106,000. Considering Bitcoin’s influence on other digital assets, it is safe to assume that the two rallies generated significant optimism for altcoins and that the correction initiated a wider sell-off. However, the fact that BTC itself corrected 2.97% in the last 24 hours to its press time price of $103,277 indicates there is more to the downturn than the market simply following the leader. BTC one-day price chart. Source: Google Profit-taking limits rallies amid resurgent economic uncertainty Moody’s decision to downgrade the U.S. credit rating caused investor anxiety and arguably spoiled the growing bullishness that followed the 90-day trade truce with China. The situation was exacerbated by the growing 30-year treasury yield, especially since President Trump already demonstrated his sensitivity to the metric during the Liberation Day announcement turmoil. Overall, the latest cryptocurrency market wipe likely showcases that any potential upsides are limited in the second half of May by investors seeking to lock in profits before macroeconomic uncertainty either leads to another crash or dissipates.

2025-05-19T10:10:58.000Z,"Bitcoin Logs Highest Weekly Close Ever, Inches Closer to All-Time High","Bitcoin has achieved its highest-ever weekly close, signaling sustained bullish momentum in the cryptocurrency market. According to data from Coingecko, BTC closed just under $106,500 on May 18 (midnight UTC), surpassing its previous record weekly close of $104,400 set in December. The digital asset now sits less than 3% away from its all-time high of $109,358, reached on January 20. The rally marks the sixth consecutive week of gains for BTC, and the trend suggests strong investor confidence. The move also secured the cryptocurrency’s highest daily candle close ever, with analysts pointing to the potential for a “new higher high” if daily closes continue above $105,000. Sustained Rally Analyst Rekt Capital noted the importance of the $105,000 level, noting that a daily close above that would signal a breakout into uncharted territory. Notably, since reaching a local top, the largest cryptocurrency has slightly dropped in value. Bitcoin is currently trading around $102,600 at the time of writing. Investor Scott Melker posted on X that BTC’s recent daily close was the highest in its history, reinforcing the growing bullish sentiment. Bitcoin’s six-week rally has drawn comparisons to its powerful surge in November, when it added $30,000 in just three of its largest weekly candles. In May so far, the cryptocurrency has climbed approximately $12,000—rising from around $94,000 to over $106,000 before pulling back slightly. Meanwhile, Arete Capital’s partner known as “McKenna” noted the reappearance of the “Coinbase premium,” a metric used to gauge U.S. investor sentiment by comparing Bitcoin prices on Coinbase and Binance. McKenna said the strength of the market’s bid, particularly on a quiet Sunday night, felt unusual—hinting that traders might be positioning themselves ahead of a major event or announcement in the coming week . Bitcoin Long-Term Growth Slowing Despite the short-term excitement, some analysts are taking a broader view. On May 18, market commentator Willy Woo highlighted that Bitcoin’s compound annual growth rate (CAGR) is trending downward—a natural sign of maturation. As Bitcoin absorbs more capital and evolves into a macro asset , Woo expects the annual growth rate to stabilize around 8% in the next 15 to 20 years. He noted that while the days of exponential growth may be cooling, BTC still outperforms most publicly investable products in the long term. “Until then,” Woo wrote, “enjoy the ride.” The post Bitcoin Logs Highest Weekly Close Ever, Inches Closer to All-Time High appeared first on TheCoinrise.com .",thecoinrise,https://thecoinrise.com/bitcoin-logs-highest-weekly-close-ever-inches-closer-to-all-time-high/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin News|Bitcoin Price|Bitcoin surge",cryptocompare
2025-05-19T10:07:21.000Z,"CME Launches Ripple (XRP) Futures Today: Here’s What You Need to Know","The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) is officially launching XRP futures contracts on May 19, introducing institutional-grade derivatives for Ripple’s native token. The move marks a major expansion of CME’s crypto offering, coming soon after its Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) futures products. Breaking Down the New XRP Futures Contracts According to a notice from April 24, the new offerings will provide traders with cash-settled exposure to XRP’s price movement based on the CME CF XRP-Dollar Reference Rate without requiring actual ownership of the asset. They also come in two distinct contract sizes to accommodate different trading strategies. The standard XRP futures contract, listed under the ticker code XRP, represents 50,000 tokens with a minimum price fluctuation of $0.0005 per one, equating to $25 per contract. For traders looking for smaller exposure, the Micro XRP futures contract (MXP) covers 2,500 XRP with the same minimum tick size of $0.0005, translating to $1.25 per contract. After-hours participants were able to access the contracts from the evening of May 18 on CME Globex and CME ClearPort. Trading hours are set to follow the standard Sunday-to-Friday CME schedule, with a one-hour daily break beginning at 4 pm CT. Per the CME notice, these contracts will be listed monthly for six consecutive months, and supplemented by four quarterly listings in March, June, September, and December. The minimum threshold for block trades stands at five contracts for standard futures and ten for micro futures, with trades required to be reported within 15-minute windows. Additionally, fee structures vary significantly depending on participant type. Individual members will enjoy the lowest rates at $4 per standard contract and $0.75 for the micro one, while non-members will have to dig deeper into their pockets, respectively coughing up $7.50 and $1.15 for the standard and micro contracts. Legal Overhang The products’ launch comes only days after Judge Analisa Torres denied a joint motion by Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an indicative ruling on a $50 million settlement they had agreed on that would have ended a years-long legal spat between the two. The judge, who previously declared that programmatic sales of XRP did not constitute security offerings, stated that it would be “procedurally improper” to approve the motion since neither the regulator nor the crypto payments company filed it correctly. Meanwhile, despite the bullish implications of institutional adoption, the price of XRP has shown muted movement. At the time of writing, the token had dipped slightly by 1.3% in 24 hours and lost 2.6% across seven days. However, it maintains a 12.1% gain over the past month, suggesting some accumulation in anticipation of the futures rollout.

2025-05-19T09:59:39.000Z,"Dubai regulator sets compliance deadline for updated crypto rules","Dubai’s crypto regulator has given licensed digital asset companies until June 19 to comply with its updated activity-based Rulebooks to enhance market integrity and risk oversight. On May 19, Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) announced that it had released Version 2.0 of the Rulebooks. The regulator said it had strengthened controls around margin trading and token distribution services, harmonised compliance requirements across all licensed activities and given clearer definitions for collateral wallet arrangements. VARA’s team will engage with licensed entities and expects the companies to comply with the updated rules after a 30-day transition period. “In line with global regulatory best practices, a 30-day transition period has been granted to all impacted virtual asset service providers [VASPs], with full compliance required by 19 June 2025,” VARA wrote. VARA enhances supervisory mechanisms VARA highlighted that it had enhanced supervisory mechanisms across several regulated activities. This includes advisory, broker-dealer, custody, exchange, lending and borrowing, virtual asset (VA) management and investment, and VA transfer and settlement services. A VARA spokesperson told Cointelegraph that the updates will bring consistency across all activity-based rules defining core operational terms. The spokesperson gave examples of terms like “client assets,” “qualified custodians,” and “collateral requirements” as some of the terms more consistently defined in the update. The update also aligned risk management and disclosure obligations, where activities overlap, in areas like brokerage, custody and exchange. “The aim was to reduce ambiguity and help VASPs navigate cross-functional compliance more easily,” VARA told Cointelegraph. Related: Dubai gov’t agencies to link real estate registry with property tokenization Dubai regulator tightens leverage thresholds for margin trading As for margin trading, the VARA spokesperson said they tightened leverage thresholds, mandated clearer collateralisation standards, and enhanced the monitoring obligations for VASPs offering this feature. Margin trading allows traders to control large positions with smaller amounts of capital. It amplifies both gains and losses. Tightening the leverage traders use helps limit the risks of widespread liquidations in a market downturn. The crypto regulator introduced a new section on token distribution that sets out licensing prerequisites, investor protections and marketing restrictions. The spokesperson emphasized the marketing restrictions, especially for “retail-facing offers.” “It’s about aligning with global conduct expectations and closing observed regulatory gaps,” the VARA spokesperson said.

With inflation worries and economic uncertainty in the air, Bitcoin is still hovering near its highs , but the road ahead looks bumpy. Analyst Breaks Down What’s Next Crypto analyst Mags explains that the $106K level has become a key barrier for Bitcoin’s price , making it hard for the asset to break higher on the first try. This latest rejection came after Bitcoin reclaimed the range, a retest that often doesn’t lead to an immediate breakout. Although Bitcoin was rejected again, Mags believes this setup still supports a bullish outlook. He outlines two possible scenarios that could unfold from here, both of which favor upward movement. #Bitcoin is Dumping – But Why? Is It Over? Yesterday, Bitcoin tested the range high for the third time and got rejected again. This area is proving to be strong resistance. Previously, rejection from this same level led to a breakdown below the range. Now, this is the first… pic.twitter.com/4KhFmiQk3Q — Mags (@thescalpingpro) May 19, 2025 Scenario One: Breakout After Brief Pause The first possible outcome is that Bitcoin consolidates slightly below the resistance before breaking out strongly. Mags says this kind of breakout is rare but very powerful. It usually comes when the market catches off guard and leads to a sudden rise in price. If Bitcoin breaks this resistance after some brief sideways movement, it could signal strong momentum and kick off the next rally. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Arthur Hayes Reveals Bold Crypto Market Prediction 2025 , Scenario Two: Pullback Before Next Leg Up The second possibility is a short-term dip. Bitcoin could move back down toward the middle of the range, which sits around the $99,400 level. Mags says this could include a brief move below that price as part of a healthy correction. Such a retest would give the market time to reset before pushing higher again. This path may take longer, but it helps build stronger support for a more sustainable move up. Outlook Remains Positive Despite the recent rejection, both of these scenarios suggest that Bitcoin still has more room to grow . Mags emphasizes that the current price action is not bearish. Instead, it shows a typical pattern of resistance testing before a larger breakout. Traders are now watching closely to see whether Bitcoin will push higher soon or take a dip before making its next move. Either way, Mags remains optimistic about the trend. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

According to data from CoinGecko, the Ethereum-based version of MOO DENG ( MOODENG ) was up about 15.5%, trading around $0.000050 on May 19, afternoon Asian time. That puts it up nearly 180% from its lowest point this year, and gives it a market cap of roughly $11.39 billion. This recent price jump was backed by strong trading activity. Daily volume surged 130% over the previous day, hitting more than $12 million, a clear sign of renewed market interest. Looking at the 4-hour chart, MOODENG has made a solid recovery since it bottomed at $0.000018 in April. It’s now trading above both its short- and long-term moving averages, which usually signals that buyers are in control.

Even more encouraging, a golden cross just formed, with the 20-day EMA crossing over the 50-day EMA. The last time this happened, MOODENG rallied about 140% from the breakout point.

Momentum on the technical front is also being matched by a rise in daily active addresses, hinting at growing network usage and retail participation. Meanwhile, whales appear to be jumping in, too.

In a blog post, Chainalysis revealed that while total revenue on darknet markets dropped 15% in 2024 due to years of international law enforcement efforts, crypto sales on a Russia-focused darknet market still jumped 68%.

2025-05-19T09:44:18.000Z,"Bitcoin to $300,000 Isn’t a Matter of How but When, Says Pundit as Price Soars Past $103,000","Bitcoin (BTC) kicked off the month with renewed momentum, breaking above $103,000. At press time, the world’s leading cryptocurrency is trading at approximately $103,241, up just over 3.50% over the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinGecko. Meanwhile, the total crypto market capitalization rose 3.10% over the same period to $3.25 trillion. However, BTC’s dominance currently sits at a commanding 61%, indicating that altcoins have lagged. That said, BTC’s surge has reignited bullish sentiment across the market, with popular trader and market analyst Gert Van Lagen confidently declaring that Bitcoin’s march toward $300,000 is now a question of when, not if . “BTC to ~$300K+ isn’t a question of if, but when. The structure is screaming for it — identical to what we saw in SPX and Gold before their breakouts.” The pundit tweeted . According to Van Lagen, Bitcoin’s current price action mirrors a textbook “cup and handle” pattern, having broken out of both the handle structure and the neckline earlier this year. Notably, Bitcoin’s ascent also coincided with a new all-time high for gold, which surged to $3,389 per troy ounce. The rally in both assets reflects growing investor concern over macroeconomic instability, especially amid escalating tensions between the U.S. and China. This uncertain backdrop has increased demand for alternative stores of value, particularly Bitcoin and gold , as investors hedge against a weakening dollar. “Bitcoin’s breakout above $87,000 is driven by rising global liquidity, fueled by expanding money supply and renewed institutional interest,” explained Dominic John, analyst at Kronos Research. Additionally, data from Glassnode reveals a sharp uptick in accumulation by large holders. Notably, whales holding over 10,000 BTC are maintaining a strong accumulation trend, with an accumulation score near 0.7. Additionally, the number of wallets holding over 1,000 BTC has climbed to a four-month high of 2,107, levels last seen during the Trump election rally in late 2024, while smaller holders appear to be exiting the market. “Whales are accumulating huge amounts of bitcoin. They know what’s coming next,” said crypto trader Mister Crypto. On-chain analytics from Santiment also shows that addresses holding between 10 and 10,000 BTC now control 67.77% of the circulating supply, adding over 53,000 BTC in April alone. That said, as geopolitical tensions rise and institutional accumulation intensifies, the road to $300,000 is beginning to look less speculative and more inevitable.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-to-300000-isnt-a-matter-of-how-but-when-says-pundit-as-price-soars-past-103000/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare
2025-05-19T09:42:57.000Z,"Bitcoin (BTC) Spikes to $107,000, Drops to $102,000 After US AAA Credit Rating Downgrade","After spiking to just over $107,000 early on Monday, Bitcoin bears arrived in force to lop off $5,000 in the period of just a few hours. In traditional finance, Moody’s credit rating agency downgraded US debt to AA1. Is Bitcoin front-running a potential US stock market dip? Bond yields spike and Bitcoin drops as US receives downgrade On Friday, the last of the top three credit rating agencies in the United States downgraded the US credit rating on its debt to Aa1, from Aaa, a rating it had held since 1917. With all three major credit rating agencies having now downgraded the US, the impact on the economy is probably about to be felt. Firstly, treasury yields have already risen as investors perceive the higher risk of holding U.S. Treasury bonds. The baseline 10-year yield has spiked to 4.52%, while the 20 yr and 30 yr yields have surged to over 5%. Volatility is going to be a major factor on Monday, while overall, the downgrade means that the US dollar just will not have the same safe haven attraction for investors as it has up to now. The Bitcoin (BTC) drop to $102,000 may have been a bit of an overreaction, or perhaps the result of profit taking, with the uncertainty of how the US stock market will react probably a major concern. It remains to be seen how the premier cryptocurrency will perform when the markets open later today. A final thought on this is that after the previous two rating agency downgrades, the longer term impact on markets was fairly limited. It might even be asked, if investors lose confidence in the US dollar, into which other fiat currency will they put their money? $BTC drops to 0.786 Fibonacci and gets bought up again Source: TradingView Looking at the $BTC chart in the 4-hour time frame, it can be noted that the price crept along the descending trendline for a while before finally breaking free and hitting that $107,000 top early on Monday. However, once it got there the reversal was fairly dramatic and took the price down to perfectly touch the deepest Fibonacci level of 0.786, at around $102,000. From there the price has been bought up again. By using the impending downgrade fallout in the US stock market, market manipulators have probably had a good day so far. $BTC bullish weekly candle close Source: TradingView The weekly time frame for $BTC continues to display a positive story. The weekly candle closed above the critical $104,000 horizontal level - a very bullish event. Of course, the price is back under this level straight away on Monday, but with the rest of the week still to come, another close above $104,000 could be a possibility. The indicators in the Stochastic RSI are coming to the top now, but with the 2-week indicators climbing as well, the weekly indicator lines could stay above the 80.00 level for quite some time. The Relative Strength Index at the bottom of the chart is starting to dip, but once again, there is the whole week left for this to change. All eyes will be on the US stock market when it opens later on Monday. This is likely going to add a lot of volatility to the mix. That said, the market prices these things in ahead of time, and it would not be a surprise for this bad news to be shaken off relatively quickly.

Moody’s recent downgrade of the U.S. credit rating removed its Aaa status, citing large deficits and rising interest costs. The last time this part of the yield curve reached such a level was on April 9, during the \""tariff tantrum\""—a period marked by aggressive market sell-offs across stocks and cryptocurrencies. Back then, Bitcoin had dropped to a local low near $75,000 , but it has since rallied to around $103,000 after peaking at $106,000 over the weekend. Market expert Jim Bianco pointed out that the last time the 30-year yield closed at or above 5% was on October 31, 2023. That was just shy of the highest recent close—5.11% on October 19, a level not seen since 2007. Adding to the pressure, foreign appetite for U.S. debt is fading. The U.K. has now overtaken China as the second-largest foreign holder of Treasuries , with $779.3 billion, behind only Japan. Both China and Japan have been steadily reducing their holdings, increasing the urgency for the U.S. to find alternative debt buyers. As more bonds are issued to cover budget shortfalls, the increase in supply is pushing yields up and prices down.

Many altcoins have followed suit on the way down, with substantial losses from the likes of SOL, ADA, AVAX, SHIB, and others. BTC Stopped at $106K Last Monday was also quite eventful for BTC, whose price went up to almost $106,000 for the first time since late January before it crashed to under $101,000 within hours. However, the bulls managed to maintain the asset within a six-digit price territory and began a recovery that pushed the cryptocurrency back to a tight range between $103,000 and $105,000. It spent most of the business week between those two boundaries, and the weekend began on a dull note , as most do. However, the landscape changed on Sunday evening when the bulls initiated a surprising rally that drove BTC to $106,000 at first, where it was stopped, but another, even more impressive run pushed it beyond $107,000 to mark a new multi-month peak. Another rejection followed, and BTC slumped by roughly $5,000 within hours to just over $102,000. It has recovered some ground since then and now sits above $103,000, and its market cap is back to $2.050 trillion.

Bitcoin one-day market cap chart. Source: CoinMarketCap Drivers of Bitcoin’s price rally Although there was no immediate trigger for the Bitcoin rally that nearly tested $107,000, several factors may have driven the price higher. For instance, investors seem to be tapping into the asset as a potential safe haven in reaction to Moody’s downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating, alongside easing trade tensions. At the same time, Bitcoin has also seen increased capital inflows into exchange-traded funds. Data shows that U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded net inflows of $608 million over the past week. On the other hand, Google also had an impressive week, with the stock rallying over 5% to close at $167.43 in the last trading session. GOOGL one-week price chart. Source: Finbold Bitcoin and Google structural differences The two assets, however, operate in different categories. Alphabet, a technology giant, is backed by tangible company assets, including its vast portfolio of services like Google Search, YouTube, and cloud computing. In contrast, Bitcoin is a decentralized currency that exists solely in the digital realm and trades 24/7 on global exchanges. This structural difference may have given Bitcoin an edge, as its surge past Alphabet occurred over the weekend, when traditional stock markets were closed. Bitcoin’s ability to trade around the clock allowed it to capitalize on weekend market momentum, while Alphabet’s stock remained static until markets reopened on Monday.

Announcing the Trillion Dollar Security (1TS) initiative: an ecosystem-wide effort to upgrade Ethereum’s security to help bring the world onchain. — Ethereum Foundation (@ethereumfndn) May 14, 2025 This move comes just days after the Pectra upgrade helped propel ETH’s price by over 43%, briefly touching $2,750. Source Analysts now view the $2,000–$2,300 range as crucial support. If this level holds, Ethereum could be on track to break past $3,000, strengthening its grip as the top programmable blockchain while boosting confidence among long-term investors. Bitcoin Pepe tipped as top altcoin as May 31 listing nears Bitcoin Pepe is quickly positioning itself as one of the most promising altcoins of 2025. Built as the first meme-centric layer 2 protocol on Bitcoin, it brings together the reliability of Bitcoin’s security with Solana-style speed and scalability. This blend offers investors a powerful mix of trust and meme-driven momentum. Bitcoin Pepe is rewriting what’s possible on the Bitcoin blockchain. Its presale rewards early investors and anchors its bold vision, unlocking Bitcoin’s $2 trillion market cap for the meme coin era. Using the groundbreaking PEP-20 token standard, Bitcoin Pepe introduces Solana-like speed via a Bitcoin layer 2 custom-built for meme assets. Time to stop sleeping on $BPEP as you're going to regret it laterSeen they've got some major partnerships lined up too.Heard the tier 1's are after this one... I'd stack now while you can. https://t.co/T3kuv2iX4G — Zenia (@Zenia_sol) May 14, 2025 With over $9m already raised in presale funding and BPEP priced at $0.0342, anticipation is building ahead of its May 31 listing event. Once the token lists on exchanges, the presale gains could accelerate.

Solana eyes $200 breakout as traders weigh cup-and-handle setup Solana (SOL) is again a focal point in the crypto market, hovering around $175 after brushing against key resistance near $170. The $170–$185 range has become a critical zone, with traders debating whether the current price action signals bullish consolidation or looming exhaustion. Crypto analyst Ali (@ali_charts) has flagged a developing cup-and-handle pattern, suggesting that a confirmed breakout above $200 could trigger a fresh wave of buying. While overbought signals remain a concern, the broader altcoin rally led by Bitcoin and Ethereum supports bullish sentiment. The next few sessions may prove decisive for Solana’s short-term trajectory. #Solana $SOL above $200 is an instant buy, as it could be breaking out of this massive cup-and-handle pattern! pic.twitter.com/cE2XUSTGLJ — Ali (@ali_charts) May 15, 2025 Unlike the other three established altcoins, Bitcoin Pepe offers traders a timely opportunity to gain early exposure to a high-potential meme layer on Bitcoin.

2025-05-19T09:16:28.000Z,"Top 5 Crypto Events to Watch Today – May 19th","The post Top 5 Crypto Events to Watch Today – May 19th appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News May 19th is turning out to be nothing like a regular (boring) Monday – everything seems to be hitting at once! This is a day packed with real-world moves that could either disrupt or immensely boost the crypto market. From high-stakes calls from the White House to a Senate vote that reshape how stablecoins are regulated in the U.S., there’s a lot happening. Let’s break it down – what’s happening, why it matters, and what to watch next. #1 Trump, Putin, and a Ceasefire Bid that Could Quiet the Chaos President Donald Trump will speak separately with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky today in a push to secure a ceasefire. “I will be speaking, by telephone, to President Vladimir Putin of Russia on Monday, at 10:00 a.m.,” Trump said on Truth Social, aiming to stop the “bloodbath” killing over 5,000 troops a week and to discuss trade. He also confirmed he’ll follow up with Zelensky and NATO members. The geopolitical backdrop is heavy – but here’s where crypto enters the picture: research shows the Russia-Ukraine war directly affects Bitcoin trading volumes. A 1% escalation in the war reportedly causes a 0.2% drop in BTC activity. So, if this ceasefire progresses, don’t be surprised to see a volume bounce and a broader market reset. #2 XRP Futures Go Live on CME – Eyes on $2.50? After months of speculation, it’s official – CME is launching XRP futures today! The move works to expand its crypto derivatives lineup and clear the way for new institutional strategies. “We’re pleased to announce our plans to expand our suite of cryptocurrency derivatives with the introduction of XRP futures on May 19, subject to regulatory review,” CME said. If it wasn’t clear – this is a big deal! Not just because CME is the world’s largest derivatives exchange, but because futures products often act as a gateway for hedge funds and tradfi institutions that can’t (or won’t) hold spot crypto. And let’s take a look back. When CME launched regulated Bitcoin futures in late 2017, it famously coincided with the top of that bull cycle. So the XRP crowd is watching closely: could this be a breakout moment? For now, signals lean bullish. Technical indicators suggest XRP could push toward $2.50, and the token is holding firm above key moving averages. Plus, there’s growing noise around institutional interest, with BlackRock’s crypto strategies and the XRP ETF launch both in the mix. #3 Coinbase Hits the S&P 500 – A Historic First for Crypto Coinbase Global (COIN) officially enters the S&P 500 today, replacing Discover Financial Services. What a milestone! “Coinbase Global Inc. (NASD: COIN) will replace Discover Financial Services (NYSE: DFS) in the S&P 500 effective prior to the opening of trading on Monday, May 19,” said S&P Global in a release. Founded in 2012, Coinbase has grown into the largest U.S.-based crypto exchange and the world’s biggest Bitcoin custodian. As of today, the company holds a market cap of $67.87 billion. For crypto, this moment is symbolic and strategic. It’s one thing to talk about adoption – it’s another to see one of the biggest names in the space sit shoulder to shoulder with Apple, Amazon, and JPMorgan on one of Wall Street’s most elite lists. Wouldn’t you agree? #4 Saylor May Be Back to Buy More Bitcoin Michael Saylor is teasing YET another big Bitcoin purchase for Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy). In a familiar move, he posted the firm’s portfolio tracker on X, a signal that’s historically preceded a BTC buy within 24 hours. “Never short a man who buys orange ink by the barrel,” he wrote. Strategy currently holds 568,840 BTC worth $59 billion, up $19.7 billion from cost basis. If this next buy lands, Bitcoin bulls may just get the fuel they need to push toward $110K. Fingers crossed. #5 Stablecoin Vote: GENIUS Act Returns to Senate Floor The GENIUS Act – a bipartisan bill aiming to establish a federal framework for payment stablecoins – is back for another vote after falling short earlier this month. Senator Bill Hagerty said, “Next week, the Senate will make history when we pass the GENIUS Act…” adding that the bill would “cement U.S. dollar dominance, protect customers, increase demand for U.S. treasuries…” Senator Gillibrand echoed the urgency, stressing stablecoins’ role in global finance. If this passes, it’ll mark the U.S.’s first serious regulatory win in crypto – and finally offer some clarity to stablecoin players. Bottom line? May 19 is stacked with events that could set the tone for the next phase of the crypto cycle. Momentum is building.

This includes advisory, broker-dealer, custody, exchange, lending and borrowing, virtual asset (VA) management and investment, and VA transfer and settlement services. A VARA spokesperson told Cointelegraph that the updates will bring consistency across all activity-based rules defining core operational terms. The spokesperson gave examples of terms like “client assets,” “qualified custodians,” and “collateral requirements” as some of the terms more consistently defined in the update.  The update also aligned risk management and disclosure obligations, where activities overlap, in areas like brokerage, custody and exchange. “The aim was to reduce ambiguity and help VASPs navigate cross-functional compliance more easily,” VARA told Cointelegraph. Related: Dubai gov’t agencies to link real estate registry with property tokenizationDubai regulator tightens leverage thresholds for margin tradingAs for margin trading, the VARA spokesperson said they tightened leverage thresholds, mandated clearer collateralisation standards, and enhanced the monitoring obligations for VASPs offering this feature. Margin trading allows traders to control large positions with smaller amounts of capital. It amplifies both gains and losses. Tightening the leverage traders use helps limit the risks of widespread liquidations in a market downturn. The crypto regulator introduced a new section on token distribution that sets out licensing prerequisites, investor protections and marketing restrictions. The spokesperson emphasized the marketing restrictions, especially for “retail-facing offers.” “It’s about aligning with global conduct expectations and closing observed regulatory gaps,” the VARA spokesperson said. Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/dubai-crypto-regulator-updates-rulebooks-tightens-margin-trading?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-19T08:55:00.000Z,"Crypto drainers as a service: What you need to know","What is a crypto drainer?              A crypto drainer is a malicious script designed to steal cryptocurrency from your wallet. Unlike regular phishing attacks that try to capture login credentials, a crypto drainer tricks you into connecting your wallets, such as MetaMask or Phantom, and unknowingly authorizing transactions that grant them access to your funds.Disguised as a legitimate Web3 project, a crypto drainer is usually promoted via compromised social media accounts or Discord groups. Once you fall prey to the fraud, the drainer can instantly transfer assets from the wallet.Crypto drainers may take various forms:Malicious smart contracts that initiate unauthorized transfers.Fake NFTs or token systems that create deceptive exchanges or assets.Crypto drainers are a growing threat in Web3, enabling quick, automated theft of crypto assets from unsuspecting users through deception. Common methods of crypto drainers include: Phishing websites.Fake airdrops.Deceptive ads.Malicious smart contracts.Harmful browser extensions.Fake NFT marketplaces.                  Crypto drainers-as-a-service (DaaS), explained              DaaS elevates the threat of crypto drainers by commercializing them. Just like  software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms, DaaS platforms sell ready-to-use malware kits to cybercriminals, often in exchange for a percentage of the stolen funds.In the DaaS model, developers offer turnkey draining scripts, customizable phishing kits and even integration help in exchange for a share of the stolen funds. A DaaS offer might be bundled with social engineering support, anonymization services and regular updates, making them attractive even to low-skill scammers.Types of crypto DaaS tools include:JavaScript-based drainers: Malicious JavaScript is embedded into phishing websites that mimic legitimate decentralized apps (DApps). These scripts execute when you connect your wallet, silently triggering approval transactions that drain assets. Token approval malware: Tricks users into granting unlimited token access via malicious smart contracts.Clipboard hijackers: Hackers use clipboard hijackers to monitor and replace copied wallet addresses with those controlled by attackers. Info-stealers: They harvest browser data, wallet extensions and private keys. Some DaaS packages combine these with loader malware that drops additional payloads or updates the malicious code. Modular drainer kits: Segregated into modules, these drainers use obfuscation techniques to bypass browser-based security tools. Did you know? According to Scam Sniffer, phishing campaigns using wallet drainers siphoned off over $295 million in NFTs and tokens from unsuspecting users in 2023.                  What crypto DaaS kits include              Crypto DaaS kits are pre-built toolsets sold to scammers, enabling them to steal digital assets with minimal technical skill. These kits typically include phishing page templates, malicious smart contracts, wallet-draining scripts and more.This is what crypto DaaS kits generally include:Pre-built drainer software: Plug-and-play malware requiring minimal setup.Phishing kits: DaaS providers supply customizable phishing website templates that hackers can modify according to their plans.Social engineering: With DaaS, hackers find support for social engineering along with psychological tactics to trick users into connecting their wallets.Operational security (OPSEC) tools: To avoid detection, some DaaS vendors offer advanced operational security tools that mask user identity and hide digital footprints.Integration assistance and/obfuscation: These services help attackers deploy drainer scripts seamlessly and use obfuscation tools to evade tracking.Regular updates: Frequent improvements are designed to bypass wallet defenses and detection systems.User-friendly dashboards: Control panels that help attackers oversee operations and monitor drained funds.Documentation and tutorials: Step-by-step instructions enabling even beginners to execute scams efficiently.Customer support: Some DaaS operators provide real-time help through secure messaging apps like Telegram.With DaaS kits available for as little as $100 to $500, or through subscription models, sophisticated crypto attacks are no longer limited to experienced hackers. Even the inexperienced can now access these scripts with a small budget, effectively democratizing this type of crime.Did you know? Advanced DaaS tools often update scripts to evade detection from browser extensions like WalletGuard and security alerts issued by MetaMask or Trust Wallet.                  Evolution of crypto drainers as prominent fraudulent activity              The threat landscape of cryptocurrency fraud is constantly evolving. Emerging around 2021, crypto drainers have rapidly transformed the landscape. Their ability to stealthily siphon funds from users' wallets has made them a threat that demands vigilance.Drainers specifically designed to target MetaMask began to emerge around 2021 and were openly advertised on illicit online forums and marketplaces.Here are some prominent drainers that have been around for some time:Chick Drainer: It emerged in late 2023, targeting Solana (SOL) users through phishing campaigns. It operates using the CLINKSINK script, embedded in fake airdrop websites.Rainbow Drainer: The platform shares code similarities with Chick Drainer, suggesting potential reuse or collaboration among threat actors.Angel Drainer: Launched around August 2023, Angel Drainer is widely promoted on Telegram by threat groups like GhostSec. Affiliate scammers need to make an upfront payment between $5,000 and $10,000 and also pay a 20% commission on all stolen assets facilitated through its platform.Rugging’s Drainer: Compatible with several crypto platforms, this DaaS drainer offers comparatively low commission fees, typically ranging from 5% to 10% of the stolen proceeds. In the wake of the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s X account being compromised in January 2024, Chainalysis found a crypto drainer acting as the SEC. This led users to connect their wallets in an attempt to claim nonexistent airdropped tokens.According to a Kaspersky Security Bulletin, dark web threads discussing crypto drainers rose sharply in 2024, jumping by 135% to 129 threads from 55 in 2022. These conversations encompass a wide range of topics, including buying and selling malicious software and forming distribution teams.As the following chart demonstrates, crypto drainers have been stealing crypto at a faster quarterly growth rate than even ransomware.                  Red flags to identify a crypto DaaS attack              Spotting a crypto wallet drainer attack early is crucial to minimizing potential losses and securing your assets. You must be careful, as a sophisticated drainer attack can sometimes evade standard alert mechanisms. You must remain vigilant even while relying on automated tools. Here are a few indicators that your wallet may be under threat:Unusual transactions: A red flag of a drainer attack is finding transactions you didn’t authorize. These may include unexpected token transfers or withdrawals to unknown wallet addresses. Sometimes, attackers execute multiple small transfers to avoid detection, so you must monitor for repeated unusual transactions of low-value crypto. Lost access to wallet: If you cannot access your wallet or your funds are missing, it could mean an attacker has taken control. This often happens when the drainer changes private keys or recovery phrases, effectively locking you out. Security alerts from wallet providers: Your crypto wallet may issue security alerts for suspicious actions, like logins from new devices, failed access attempts or unauthorized transactions. These warnings indicate that someone may be trying to access your wallet or has already accessed it.Fake project websites or DApps: If you find a cloned or newly launched platform mimicking a real Web3 service and prompting wallet connections, it is a warning sign of a crypto drainer. It might also have urgent calls to action, urging users to immediately claim rewards, airdrops, or mint NFTs. The objective is to pressure victims into connecting wallets without verifying authenticity.Unverified social media promotions: Suspicious links shared via X, Discord, Telegram or Reddit, often unverified profiles, indicate a fraudulent attempt to drain money from a wallet. Fraudsters may also use compromised accounts to share malicious links. Unaudited smart contracts: Interacting with unfamiliar contracts without public audits or GitHub transparency can expose wallets to hidden drainer scripts.Wallet prompts requesting broad permissions: Sign-in or approval requests that ask for full token spending access or access to all assets, rather than specific transactions, are serious warning signs.Did you know? Just one popular drainer kit can be used by hundreds of affiliates. That means a single DaaS platform can be behind thousands of wallet thefts in a matter of days.                  How to protect your crypto wallet from DaaS attackers              To protect your crypto wallet from DaaS attackers, adopting strong, proactive security practices is essential. Blockchain monitoring tools can help identify suspicious patterns linked to drainer activity, allowing you to respond quickly. Here are key strategies to help protect your digital assets:Use hardware wallets: Hardware wallets, or cold wallets, store private keys offline, shielding them from online threats like malware and phishing. Keeping your keys in a physical device significantly lowers the risk of remote attacks and is ideal for securing long-term crypto holdings.Enable 2FA (two-factor authentication): Adding 2FA to your wallet means even if someone steals your password, they will need a second verification step. They need to put in a verification code sent to your phone to access the account, along with your password, making unauthorized access much harder.Avoid phishing links: Always verify URLs and avoid clicking on unsolicited messages claiming rewards or updates. Never input private keys or seed phrases on suspicious sites. When in doubt, manually enter the correct website address.Secure your private keys and seed phrases: Store your private keys and seed phrases offline in a safe, physical location. Never save these credentials on internet-connected devices, or hackers might get access to them, putting your wallet at risk. Verify apps and browser extensions: Take care to install software only from official sources. Research apps beforehand to avoid malicious or fake tools.Monitor wallet activity regularly: Check your wallet for unauthorized transactions or unusual patterns. Early detection can help stop further losses and improve recovery chances.                  What to do if you suffer from a crypto-drainer attack              Swift action is essential if you suspect your crypto wallet has been compromised. Though fund recovery is rare, quick action can limit further losses.Here are the steps you need to take if you suffer from a crypto DaaS attack:Secure your accounts: Immediately change the password for your wallet and enable 2FA, if you still have access to it. Transfer any remaining funds to a secure, uncompromised wallet.Notify your wallet provider or exchange: Report the incident to your wallet provider or exchange. You could request them to monitor your account or freeze suspicious activity. Platforms may flag suspicious addresses or prevent further transfers.File a report with authorities: Contact local law enforcement or cybercrime units, as cryptocurrency theft is treated as a financial crime in most regions.Seek professional assistance: Cybersecurity firms specializing in blockchain forensics can analyze transactions and potentially trace the stolen funds. While full recovery is unlikely, especially if assets pass through mixers or bridges, expert help may aid investigations.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/crypto-drainers-as-a-service-what-you-need-to-know?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The team claimed to have immediately responded and taken action involving multiple departments, including the firm’s chief operating officer, Helen Liu.Other people involved in the operation were the heads of customer service, risk control, the Chinese-language division, product managers and the technical team. The exchange coordinated its actions with the user.After an internal investigation, Bybit concluded this was a “unique case affecting an individual user, not a systemic issue.” The account’s KYC information was not tampered with and the funds in the account remained secure at all times.Bybit had not answered Cointelegraph’s request for comment at the time of writing.Related: A decade-old debate is back as self-custody gets smarterThe perks of media attentionBybit claims to have taken large-scale and timely action, which involved a member of its executive team, all in response to an issue reported by a single user. Chinese-speaking X crypto influencer EnHeng claimed to be the reason for this.In a separate post that Bybit’s X post answers to — EnHeng explained that in a group chat, he noticed “a girl mentioned a bug related to Bybit’s Apple ID.” He verified the issue and after confirming that it was real, flagged it to Bybit.EnHeng said that the staff responded quickly and assisted the user in recovering access to about $100,000 worth of funds. They highlighted:“This incident really made me feel the value of having influence.”EnHeng said “in this market, retail investors often lack a voice and are vulnerable.” For this reason, he said, “When we have more resources and a bigger voice, we should use them to speak up for retail investors.”Related: Self-custody vs. centralized crypto cards: Freedom or convenience?Locked out of exchangeBeing locked out of a cryptocurrency exchange account or some of its features is not excessively uncommon. Often, it is an emergency measure meant to prevent fund losses.A recent example is Phemex crypto exchange halting withdrawals after being alerted to nearly $30 million worth of suspicious outflows that raised alarms among blockchain security firms in late January. Indian cryptocurrency exchange Mudrex temporarily halted crypto withdrawals during the same month, claiming compliance improvements were the reason.Sometimes action is taken on the request of law enforcement. Last summer, a small set of Palestinian user accounts was frozen after Israeli authorities issued a seizure request. Also last summer, OKX warned it would terminate any account linked to crypto mixer Tornado Cash or sanctioned addresses, and several users said their log-ins were suddenly disabled.Those incidents echo an old adage popular in the Bitcoin (BTC) community: Not your keys, not your coins.

2025-05-19T07:55:20.000Z,"Vitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes for Ethereum scaling","Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin unveiled a proposal to preserve trustless, censorship-resistant access to Ethereum, even as the network scales. On May 19, Buterin shared a post outlining how to make Ethereum's layer-1 scaling “more friendly” to users running local nodes for personal use. The Ethereum co-founder highlighted the importance of independent users running nodes, saying that a market dominated by a few Remote Procedure Call (RPC) providers risks censorship. RPC providers let wallets, users and apps interact with the blockchain without running their own nodes. Crypto wallets are usually connected to an RPC provider behind the scenes. Buterin believes there are risks to this setup. “A market structure dominated by a few RPC providers is one that will face strong pressure to deplatform or censor users. Many RPC providers already exclude entire countries,” Buterin wrote. Source: Vitalik ButerinVitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes In addition to censorship, Buterin argued that reasons like expensive fully-trustless cryptographic solutions and metadata privacy show that there’s value in ensuring greater ease for those running a personal node. In the proposal, Buterin's solution relies on a novel type of node called “partially stateless nodes.” These nodes are designed to help users maintain privacy-preserving access to blockchain data without the heavy resource demands of running a full node. As Ethereum scales and the gas limit increases, running a full node requires more storage and bandwidth. Buterin said partially stateless nodes address the issue by allowing users to verify the blockchain and serve local data, but only store a subset of the Ethereum state, based on the user’s needs.Vitalik Buterin’s graphic of partially stateless nodes. Source: Vitalik ButerinRelated: Ethereum Foundation unveils security initiative to supplant legacy systemsA new node type to validate blocks “statelessly”The nodes would operate by validating blocks statelessly. This means they don't require the storage of the full Merkle proofs or the entire blockchain history. They can selectively keep certain parts of the state up to date. This means that users could configure their nodes only to save data related to their accounts, the decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, and their commonly used tokens like stablecoins and Ether (ETH). The rest of the data will be left out, and queries beyond the stored subset will fail or be routed through an RPC solution. Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/vitalik-buterin-partially-stateless-nodes-ethereum-scaling-privacy?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-19T07:38:51.000Z,"How to read a Bitcoin liquidation map (without getting liquidated)","Understanding a Bitcoin liquidation map is imperative in dealing with the inherent volatility of the crypto market. The visual tool showcases probable liquidation levels, indicating where large orders may cause cascading price changes. This post explores how to interpret a Bitcoin liquidation map, allowing you to trade smarter in the volatile world of cryptocurrency.What is liquidation in crypto trading?In cryptocurrency trading, liquidation happens when an exchange forcefully closes a trader's leveraged position due to insufficient margin to pay losses. This usually occurs when the market moves sharply against the position. Long liquidations occur when prices fall, affecting traders who bet on an uptrend. Short liquidations happen when prices unexpectedly rise, impacting those who bet on a decline. Did you know? In crypto, a single liquidation cascade can wipe out millions in minutes, triggered not by hacking but by traders using too much leverage at the wrong time.What is a Bitcoin liquidation map?A Bitcoin liquidation map is a visual heatmap indicating price levels where large liquidations are expected to occur. These maps assist traders in identifying zones where leveraged positions may be closed forcibly if prices fluctuate sharply. Tools like CoinGlass provide real-time Bitcoin (BTC) liquidation maps, valuable resources for risk-aware traders. With the liquidation map, you canUse breakout trading strategies for profitable scalping opportunities.Set stop-loss levels based on key liquidation zones for better risk management.Target high-liquidity areas to secure profits efficiently.Enter large trades near liquidity clusters to minimize slippage and enhance execution.Analyze the gradient of liquidation intensity to anticipate potential price movements..Functioning of a liquidation map and key components The X-axis of the liquidation chart represents the bid price, while the Y-axis denotes the relative strength of liquidation activity. Each column on the graphic illustrates a liquidation cluster's relative significance compared to other clusters.The chart demonstrates how the market will respond if the price reaches certain thresholds. Taller liquidation bars indicate a higher potential impact. The various hues are solely for visual clarity, allowing users to distinguish between distinct liquidation zones.Here are the main components of a liquidation map:Heat zones: Indicate where most positions could be eliminated if the price reaches specific levels.Liquidity pools: Collections of stop-loss and liquidation orders that can cause rapid price movements.Open interest levels: Demonstrate where large amounts of leveraged positions are concentrated.Price imbalances or gaps: Disclose areas without support or resistance, allowing prices to move swiftly.Did you know? Crypto liquidations often follow the herd; when too many traders place similar bets, liquidation maps light up and whales use them as price targets.How to use a liquidation map in your Bitcoin trading strategyA Bitcoin liquidation map provides insights into probable price movements and risk zones by visually representing places where leveraged positions will likely be closed. Here is how to use a liquidation map in Bitcoin trading:Identify high-risk zones: Identify places with dense liquidation clusters to avoid overleveraging. These areas come across as magnets, attracting price changes that might cause a series of liquidations.Time entry and exit: Liquidation clusters help find the optimal entry and exit points. Entering and exiting trades before a cluster becomes risky helps you lock in profits before reversals.Combine with technical indicators: Enhance your research by combining liquidation maps with tools such as support/resistance levels and relative strength index (RSI). This sets out a comprehensive view of market conditions.Avoid herd mentality: Exercise caution in places with high leverage concentrations. Such zones may be traps constructed by larger players to induce liquidations and profit from the resulting volatility.Monitor whale activity: Large traders frequently target liquidation zones to turn price moves to their advantage. Observing these patterns can provide insights about prospective market movements.Anticipate reversals: Markets frequently experience reversals following large liquidation events. Recognizing these trends can aid in positioning for possible rebounds.Implement robust risk management: Use stop-loss orders and handle leverage carefully. Liquidation maps can help you determine where to put these orders to minimize exposure.Common mistakes to avoid when using the Bitcoin liquidation mapUsing a Bitcoin liquidation map can enhance trading decisions, but misinterpretation can lead to costly errors. Here are common mistakes you need to avoid:Blindly trading toward liquidity zones: If you are trading toward liquidity zones without thinking, expect reversals.Misreading map colors or scale: Making a mistake in judging map colors or scale can skew your risk assessment.Over-relying on liquidation data without context: Maps are valuable tools, not an assurance that what they reflect will happen.Ignoring macro news or sentiment analysis: External events often override technical signals. A sudden event may make all predictions fall flat.Always combine liquidation maps with broader technical analysis. Smart trading requires context, not just colorful charts.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Source: PACERCoinbase reported on May 15 that four days earlier it had been hit with a $20 million extortion attempt after cybercriminals bribed several of its customer support agents to access internal systems and steal a limited amount of user account data.The stolen data included names, addresses, phone numbers, emails, the last four digits of Social Security numbers, some bank account identifiers, driver’s licenses, passports and some account data, such as balance snapshots and transaction history.Bender claimed that “Coinbase failed to implement and maintain reasonable security safeguards,” which exposed users to “serious and ongoing risks.”The suit also claimed Coinbase’s response to the incident was “inadequate, fragmented, and delayed.”“Users were not promptly or fully informed of the compromise, and Coinbase did not immediately take meaningful steps to mitigate further harm,  provide identity protection services, or offer actionable guidance to affected individuals,” the complaint claimed.The lawsuit claimed users could face “substantial, immediate, and ongoing threat of identity theft and financial fraud” and that the consequences of the breach could be long-term or “potentially permanent” because the compromised information can’t be recovered or made secure once exposed.Flurry of lawsuits make similar allegations Two other lawsuits filed in a New York federal court made similar claims against Coinbase, while a fourth lawsuit added the allegation of unjust enrichment, arguing that Coinbase didn’t spend enough on data security measures.All four complaints ask for damages and other measures to help protect the plaintiff’s sensitive data.Meanwhile, a fifth lawsuit filed in a California federal court on May 15 made similar claims against Coinbase, but asked the court to order Coinbase to purge all sensitive data it holds about the plaintiffs and hire third-party security auditors to test its security systems, among other requests.A Coinbase spokesperson did not comment on the lawsuits and instead pointed Cointelegraph to a blog post it shared regarding the data breaches.Coinbase said it refused to pay the $20 million ransom and has flagged plans to reimburse users tricked into sending crypto to phishing scammers due to the data breach.In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the exchange said it expects reimbursement expenses ranging from $180 million to $400 million.Related: Retired artist loses $2M in crypto to Coinbase impersonatorThe exchange also reportedly fired a group of customer support agents based in India following their alleged involvement in social engineering attacks on users.Coinbase (COIN) shares dipped 7% and dropped to $244 after it disclosed the data breach along with an ongoing SEC probe over misstated user numbers in 2021.The stock has since staged a comeback, spiking 9% and hitting $266 by the closing bell on May 16, according to Google Finance. Coinbase has climbed even higher following the data breach.

Bitcoin developer John Carvalho introduced Bitcoin Improvement Proposal-177 on April 23, which seeks to eliminate the concept of satoshis, of which there are 100,000,000 in 1 Bitcoin (BTC), and effectively split Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million into 21 quadrillion units.It follows a 2017 proposal from Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song to create “bits,” representing one-millionth of 1 Bitcoin. However, Carvalho said Song’s approach would still require Bitcoin users to think about decimals and “shifts complexity rather than eliminating it.”Block Inc. CEO Jack Dorsey is among those calling for the change, saying in a May 18 X post that satoshis, or sats, are too confusing for newcomers.“Bits of Bitcoin is better, and just Bitcoin is best,” Dorsey said.Dorsey pointed to a December 2024 discussion on the topic where Stevie Lee, product lead of Bitcoin infrastructure firm Spiral, argued that not enough people know or care about what satoshis are.“Everyone knows Bitcoin, no one knows sats, people just want to send and receive Bitcoin,” Lee said, recalling past conversations where people thought satoshis were an entirely new token, unrelated to Bitcoin.He added that the Bitcoin community shouldn’t be too concerned with the change, as they know the underlying economics of Bitcoin would remain intact.Related: DOJ charges 12 more gamer-turned $263M Bitcoin robbersSwan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten and Byte Federal director of product Michelle Weekley were among those who opposed the change.“People understand cents in a dollar, they will understand sats in a Bitcoin,” Weekley said on X.Magdalena Gronowska, a self-described Bitcoin consultant, claimed that the change could make some people think that Bitcoin abruptly crashed from its current price of around $100,000 and that its “supply has massively inflated.”Zaprite business development lead Parker Lewis argued that sats were easier to understand.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewBoth moving averages are sloping up, and the relative strength index (RSI) is in the overbought zone, signaling that the buyers hold the edge.

They will try to pull the price back into the triangle. If that happens, the aggressive bulls may get trapped, pulling the pair to $100,000.

If they manage to do that, the pair could surge toward $3,000.The first sign of weakness will be a break below the $2,400 level.

A recent Gemini Institutional Insights report actually noted how a new Ethereum L2 solution is launched approximately every 19 days. In response to the seemingly endless conveyor belt of new zkEVMs and optimistic rollups coming to market, the chorus of criticism continues to grow louder: “This is definitely the saturation point, no more chains are needed.”Some of the most outspoken critics of L2s argue that L2s are redundant, but this is narrow thinking. In many ways, the idea that creating new L2s should be slowed down is like arguing that there were too many websites in 1998. The proliferation of L2s is not causing the Web3 space to become overly bloated or fragmented at all. The number of chains today isn’t too many. It’s laughably few, and right now is the early innings of a multi-decade explosion in specialized, modular blockchain infrastructure.The rise of L2s is far from a passing fadWhile some contend that this L2 surge we’ve been experiencing is merely a temporary frenzy led by DeFi degenerates, it’s really an enterprise-grade infrastructure expansion, as banks (including Deutsche Bank), game studios (gaming activity on some L2 blockchains rose by over 20,000% in February 2025), logistics networks and global manufacturers get on board. Industries like banking and logistics, which are typically risk-averse, don’t make major tech pivots lightly. They do so because they have to, and in many cases, public blockchains do not meet their needs. Returning to their inherent risk-averse DNA, large enterprises and institutions in these sectors generally won’t want to build on shared, general-purpose L1s. Instead, they’ll want to deploy their own chains where they can enjoy custom performance, predictable costs, jurisdictional compliance and granular-level privacy.This focus on proprietary networks isn’t solely a Web3 thing. Let’s think about it. Did Facebook, Netflix and JPMorgan co-host on GeoCities? Of course not, so why would Web3 be any different? Shared L1s and monolithic architectures might have worked for early token experiments and composable DeFi primitives. Still, realistically, they can’t support real-world businesses’ complexity, regulatory burden or contractual requirements.The growing viability of L2sThanks to modular stacks, rollup-as-a-service platforms and breakthrough zero-knowledge proof technology, spinning up a dedicated chain is becoming increasingly viable and accessible to a wide range of enterprises across the industry spectrum. As the infrastructure improves, the cost of launching and maintaining specialized chains will also reduce, so a substantial rise in the number of L2s can be expected as time goes on.Recent: Devs introduce Ethereum R1 layer-2 scaling solutionSome onlookers will argue that this future will be convoluted for users forced to hop between chains while voicing concerns about liquidity fragmentation and the dispersal of tradable assets across multiple platforms. These are short-sighted concerns. We’re building toward seamless interoperability through shared settlement layers, trust-minimized bridges and unified account abstraction. Ultimately, the end-user won’t care whether they’re on rollup #4,318 or chain #9,072; they’ll just transact with ease and be happy with that. In the same way that cloud computing unlocked hyper scale by abstracting the hardware layer, modular blockchains are unlocking hyperscale for value transfer, asset issuance and programmable trust. Irrespective of what the doubters say, specialized L2s won’t cannibalize each other. They’ll serve different verticals, jurisdictions and use cases. There is no reason why an L2 for high-frequency trading can’t easily coexist with an L2 for national land registries.We’re not drowning in chains — we’re barely ankle-deep in the grand scheme of things. Anyone seriously betting on consolidation or some magical “winner-take-all” chain is just betting against scale and sovereignty. The real bet is hundreds of L2s and thousands of use cases as part of one modular, scalable future.Opinion by: Igor Mandrigin, co-founder and CTPO of Gateway.fm.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-18T09:40:57.000Z,"‘Bitcoin Standard’ author backs funding dev to make spamming Bitcoin costly","Economist and author of The Bitcoin Standard, Saifedean Ammous, has weighed in on the ongoing debate over spam inscriptions on the Bitcoin network, suggesting he would “throw in a few sats” to fund a full-time developer focused on making Bitcoin spamming more difficult and expensive.Ammous made the remarks in response to a thread initiated by the pseudonymous developer GrassFedBitcoin, who called for Bitcoin Core to merge pull request #28408, which would enable node operators to filter inscriptions more easily.According to GrassFedBitcoin, the lack of inscription filtering tools contributes to unnecessary blockchain bloat and undermines Bitcoin (BTC)’s role as a monetary protocol.“No one running a node wants to relay inscriptions,” he wrote, arguing that the OP_RETURN limit increases were justified in the past under false assumptions. He pushed for a configurable, default policy discouraging the use of Bitcoin for storing JPEGs rather than monetary data.Blockstream CEO Adam Back challenged the proposal, describing inscription filtering as an “arms race.” He noted that spam data embedded in Bitcoin transactions can be endlessly modified using code structures, requiring constant updates to filtering tools.Source: Adam BackRelated: Bitcoin Ordinals vs. Ethereum NFTs: A comparative overviewAmmous compares Bitcoin spam to emailAmmous compared the Bitcoin spam issue to email spam — another arms race society continues to fight without abandoning the system.“It’s not easy, but it’s worth trying to help bankrupt the spammers faster,” Ammous said. He argued that fighting spam is not censorship, noting that node operators already reject invalid transactions.“So a node runner looking to remove retards' spam is no less valid than retards' spam,” he added.The debate drew commentary from other users. One participant suggested Core developers treat spam-coding employees at certain startups as “unwilling QA engineers” and simply unstandardize every trick they deploy.Ammous took it further, proposing to “deprecate” the work of developers building spam tools and even hiring outside coders to overwhelm their systems.Source: Saifedean AmmousThe conversation reflects ongoing tensions in the Bitcoin community over the network’s intended use. With inscriptions continuing to congest the network, calls for technical countermeasures — and pointed critiques of those defending spam — are growing louder.In a Feb. 4 report, Mempool Research said the adoption of inscriptions could drive the Bitcoin network’s average block size as high as 4 megabytes (MB) per block, far higher than current averages.Bitcoin’s average block size — the amount of data in each block posted to the network’s public ledger — is currently around 1.5 MB.Magazine: Arthur Hayes $1M Bitcoin tip, altcoins’ powerful rally’ looms: Hodler’s Digest, May 11 – 17",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/saifedean-ammous-funds-dev-to-fight-bitcoin-spam?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

But in March, Suman received a text message appearing to be from Coinbase, warning him of unauthorized account access.After responding, he got a phone call from a man identifying himself as a Coinbase security staffer named Brett Miller. The caller appeared knowledgeable, correctly stating that Suman’s funds were stored in a hardware wallet.He then convinced Suman that his wallet could still be vulnerable and walked him through a “security procedure” that involved entering his seed phrase into a website mimicking Coinbase’s interface.Nine days later, a second caller claiming to be from Coinbase repeated the process.

2025-05-17T15:21:23.000Z,"A Bitcoiner’s guide to South Africa’s Garden Route","South Africa’s Garden Route, famed for its lush forests, expansive beaches and charming towns, has become a testbed for Bitcoin adoption.From Mossel Bay to Witsand and Plettenberg Bay to Knysna, Bitcoin has become popular among shop owners and travelers alike for a multitude of reasons.“We’re seeing the early signs of a parallel, permissionless economy emerging across an entire region,” James Caw, founder of SimplB — a local crypto asset provider — told Cointelegraph, “where small businesses benefit from faster, lower-cost digital payments and where people have more options to earn, send and receive sound money securely.”For tourists, the benefits are immediate: no currency exchange hassles, no international card fees, and the ability to pay instantly and securely. For locals, Bitcoin (BTC) offers a hedge against inflation, protection from currency volatility and new economic opportunities.Here’s a taste of what a Bitcoin-friendly trip along the Garden Route is like.The Garden Route is where Bitcoin meets paradiseThe Garden Route is one of South Africa’s premier tourist corridors. It stretches roughly 300 kilometers from Mossel Bay in the west to the Storms River Mouth in the east, attracting hundreds of thousands of tourists yearly.Crypto adoption is escalating thanks to South Africa’s regulatory environment, which now recognizes Bitcoin as a financial product. Across the Garden Route, you can spend pre-acquired Bitcoin freely, with little concern for local tax or exchange controls.It’s a grassroots movement. Towns like Witsand and Plettenberg Bay are at the forefront, and national retailers like Pick n Pay provide a safety net for crypto spending along the way. Every Pick n Pay store, including supermarkets, clothing outlets and Express convenience stores, accepts Bitcoin via the CryptoQR app. This guarantees you can always buy daily goods with Bitcoin wherever you travel. Related: Stablecoin fever: 5 major stablecoins are growing crypto adoptionWitsand is the Bitcoin villageLocated at the mouth of the Breede River, Witsand is a sleepy coastal town with a big reputation in the Bitcoin world. Here, Bitcoin isn’t just accepted — it’s preferred.It’s thanks to the efforts of local champions like Edwin Jones, a software engineer and passionate supporter of Bitcoin adoption in the Garden Route. Witsand has become a functioning Bitcoin circular economy. Accommodation options like Fantasea and Happy Days holiday homes, meals at Ellie’s on Main, groceries at local shops, gym memberships, boat services, petrol, surf lessons and mini-golf can be paid for using Bitcoin.As Jones notes: Bitcoin Witsand existed long before we gave it a name. It was just having conversations with friends, and as the local businesses started understanding Bitcoin, they actually demanded we start getting the technology in place.The town’s small and close-knit community has enabled rapid adoption; more than 45 establishments accept Bitcoin as of early 2025. The town’s enthusiasm is infectious, as locals and visitors enjoy the ease and security of digital payments.Witsand proudly announces its acceptance of Bitcoin. Source: Edwin JonesWitsand’s success as a Bitcoin hub is rooted in its community-driven approach. Jones outlines its growth by outlining that: Although there have been many individual businesses over the years since 2009 that started and stopped accepting Bitcoin for the Garden Route, the adoption really started kicking off in 2021.“With the Lightning Network starting to reach maturity around that time, the first Spaza Shop in Mossel Bay, Bitcoin Ekasi, started accepting Bitcoin in August 2021, and the first restaurant in Witsand in December of the same year.”Education has been central to the process. Local advocates have focused on teaching business owners the fundamentals of Bitcoin, warning against scams and emphasizing the difference between Bitcoin and speculative altcoins. “With all the circular economies advocating against gambling and trading, cautioning against interest and investments, being explicitly Bitcoin, and focusing on the fundamentals rather than the price, scammers have been kept at bay,” Jones said. “We have also found that businesses don’t have to adapt as much as evolve.”Bitcoin doesn’t change a business — it just supercharges it. Doing the same old things, much better.Mossel Bay’s surf and social upliftmentMossel Bay, the historical gateway to the Garden Route, is not just about beaches and maritime history. Mossel Bay is home to Bitcoin Ekasi, a pioneering project that brought Bitcoin to the township of JCC Camp.Bitcoin Ekasi empowers unbanked residents by enabling them to earn and spend Bitcoin locally. Coaches at The Surfer Kids nonprofit are paid in Bitcoin, and local spaza shops accept Bitcoin for daily necessities.For the Bitcoiner tourist, Mossel Bay offers a unique opportunity for “conscious crypto-tourism.” You can take surf lessons from instructors paid in Bitcoin, visit the Bitcoin Ekasi education center, or support the project with direct donations.The town also boasts a Pick n Pay that accepts Bitcoin. As SimplB’s Caw observes: The Bitcoin Ekasi project first started when they began accepting Bitcoin because of the demand from foreign tourists visiting Mossel Bay. It is just so simple to function on a Bitcoin standard once you begin using it.Plettenberg Bay is the fastest-growing Bitcoin economyFurther east, Plettenberg Bay has witnessed an explosion in Bitcoin adoption. In just a few months, the number of Bitcoin-accepting merchants jumped from five to more than 75, making it one of Africa’s most dynamic crypto economies.Confirmed acceptors include Ferris Cars (which facilitates rental accommodation payments in crypto), Glow Lighting Design and all local Pick n Pay branches. Adventure tourism companies, boutique retailers and professional services are increasingly receptive to Bitcoin, especially if you ask. The rapid growth suggests an enthusiastic local scene, with businesses eager to tap into the spending power of Bitcoin tourists.Related: 8 major crypto firms announce US expansion this yearPlettenberg Bay offers a vibrant mix of beach life, nature and crypto-friendly commerce. The town’s energy is palpable, and visitors are encouraged to engage with merchants, share information about Lightning payments, and help grow the ecosystem.“Right now Plettenberg Bay is by far the most interesting circular economy in Africa and possibly the world,” said Jones. “It currently boasts having the most businesses accepting Bitcoin of any town in Africa and has achieved this in less than three months.”Bitcoin preferred signs can be found along the Garden Route.

It was one of the trial sites for the innovative QR code converter from MoneyBadger, which enables Bitcoin spending at every Pick n Pay in South Africa.Sedgefield itself doesn’t have the same density of Bitcoin-accepting independent merchants as Witsand or Plettenberg Bay, but the presence of Pick n Pay ensures that crypto tourists can always pay for groceries and essentials with sats.Practical information for your tripIf you do make it out to the Garden Route, recommended wallets include Blink, Wallet of Satoshi and Phoenix — all Lightning-enabled and widely used in the region. In larger towns like Knysna, George, Wilderness and Oudtshoorn, the Bitcoin scene is still emerging. There aren’t yet established circular economies, but the nationwide acceptance of Bitcoin at Pick n Pay provides a reliable foundation for spending.The Spasie on Breede Restaurant and Bar is just one of many establishments accepting Bitcoin. Source: Edwin JonesBTC Map occasionally lists independent merchants, like Beans About Coffee in Oudtshoorn. Still, the best strategy is to ask around, look for Bitcoin signage, and use mapping tools to discover new acceptors.For accommodation, activities and dining, direct inquiry remains key. Many guesthouses and tour operators are open to Bitcoin payments, especially as awareness grows.

2025-05-17T15:00:00.000Z,"The DeFi mullet — Fintech needs DeFi in the back","Opinion by: Merlin Egalite, co-founder at Morpho LabsFintechs in the front, decentralized finance (DeFi) in the back: the DeFi Mullet.Today’s fintech companies offer excellent user experiences but are constrained by traditional financial infrastructure — siloed, slow, expensive and inflexible. Meanwhile, DeFi provides lightning-fast, cost-effective, interoperable infrastructure but lacks mainstream accessibility.The solution? Combine fintech’s distribution and user experience with DeFi’s efficient back end.The mullet is inevitableFintech companies heavily rely on traditional financial (TradFi) infrastructure that is siloed, slow to deploy and run, and costly to maintain. This inefficiency limits their control over costs and product offerings and has potential infrastructure risks. Fintechs have a strong incentive to transition to building on autonomous, credibly neutral public infrastructure.The power of DeFi is evident in stablecoins. While traditional international wire transfers cost $30–$50 and take one to five business days, stablecoin transfers cost mere cents and settle in seconds. This revolutionary improvement in financial infrastructure extends beyond payments. DeFi provides 24/7/365 infrastructure for trading, lending and borrowing with instant settlement, open access and deep liquidity, enabling better price execution and yields.Plugging their compliance-ready front end into DeFi infrastructure, fintech companies can focus on creating exceptional user experiences. This opens up tremendous opportunities for innovation while driving more liquidity onchain, creating a positive feedback loop of embracing the DeFi Mullet.Now is the time for mainstream adoptionToday’s DeFi ecosystem has proven its reliability for fintech integration. There are dozens of protocols that demonstrate this maturity, securely managing billions in loans through immutable, governance-minimized designs. DeFi infrastructure gives fintechs complete control over their infrastructure. This is particularly crucial after the recent Synapse bankruptcy that trapped Yotta user funds meant to be insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.Recent: Bitcoin DeFi will have 300M users, beating Ethereum and Solana: ExecInstitutions are also coming onchain. BlackRock has tokenized a fund via Securitize; Stripe has acquired Bridge for $1 billion to scale its stablecoin solutions; the US is creating a strategic Bitcoin (BTC) reserve; and clarity on regulation is opening the floodgates. The shift is step-by-step but tangible.DeFi has arrived.The next phaseFor years to come, expect more products like crypto-backed loans to be released by fintech’s most advanced players, offering onchain saving accounts, onchain loans, instant international payments and more. This transformation will be invisible to users and powered by smart wallets and account abstraction that maintain the familiar Web2-like user experience at which fintech companies excel. Early adopters will gain significant advantages over competitors.Yet, unlike building on traditional finance, DeFi’s open infrastructure means even latecomers can benefit from existing network effects without starting from zero.Some skeptics argue that the involvement of fintechs and traditional institutions will erode decentralization, as protocols must comply with regulatory requirements. While this concern is understandable, the opposite is more likely.Expecting protocols to achieve compliance across every jurisdiction worldwide is unrealistic, especially given the vast regulatory fragmentation. Instead, regulating the apps that interface with users makes far more sense rather than the underlying protocols. For this regulatory model to work, however, protocols must remain credibly neutral.A credibly neutral mechanism adheres to four principles:It embeds no preference for specific individuals or outcomes.It is open-source with publicly verifiable execution.It is simple and understandable.It changes infrequently.Examples like HTTP and SMTP demonstrate the power of credibly neutral protocols — they are free, open and unregulated, with only the clients subject to oversight. The same logic should apply to governance-minimized, immutable DeFi protocols.These constraints will push DeFi builders toward creating genuinely decentralized and trustless systems.Fintechs integrating DeFi protocols can build on top of the most neutral infrastructure and access their growing network effects.Let the mullet growThe DeFi mullet is more than just a meme — it’s a structural shift.To scale, DeFi must meet users where they are: through regulated, user-friendly fintech channels. For fintechs to stay relevant, they must offer their customers the best user experience and opportunities, such as the best rates. Those who miss this opportunity risk falling into irrelevance, much like traditional retail banks losing market share to today’s fintechs.This convergence isn’t just possible — it’s inevitable.Opinion by: Merlin Egalite, co-founder at Morpho Labs.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-17T12:09:46.000Z,"Bitcoin to $250K in 2025 ‘totally possible’ — crypto analyst Scott Melker","Bitcoin’s next explosive move could send the asset to $250,000 by the end of 2025, according to Scott Melker, a crypto analyst and host of The Wolf of All Streets podcast.Speaking in a recent interview, Melker cited growing institutional interest and diminishing volatility as key factors that could drive the next leg up.“250K this year, totally possible,” Melker said, adding that Bitcoin (BTC)’s volatility has declined significantly in recent years.“It used to be about three times as volatile as the S&P. Now it’s less than two times.” He pointed to increased involvement from pension funds and ETF issuers as evidence of a more mature, stable market.The shift, he argued, reflects a broader trend of institutional adoption. “The more institutional money, the more Wall Street money, the more long-term holders get involved, the less volatility there’s going to be,” Melker explained.Related: New Bitcoin price all-time highs could occur in MayCrypto markets show signs of strength in 2025Market activity in 2025 has already shown signs of strength. Bitcoin surged past $104,000, while Ether (ETH) reclaimed levels above $2,600.Coinbase’s addition to the S&P 500 marked a major milestone for crypto’s integration into mainstream finance. Melker noted the company is not just entering the index but doing so in the top 50 by market cap — a reflection of how deeply rooted some crypto firms have become.In addition to Coinbase, firms like Galaxy Digital and eToro have moved forward with public listings, signaling confidence in regulatory conditions under the current US administration.Melker said that this environment, bolstered by dropped SEC lawsuits and favorable executive orders, has created what he calls “an extremely bullish” backdrop for the sector.While Bitcoin remains the primary focus, Melker acknowledged a renewed interest in altcoins. Recent price action saw Ethereum outpace Bitcoin, triggering a rally across smaller-cap tokens — a sign, he said, that “new money” is entering the space rather than just rotating within it.Related: Here is why Bitcoin price is stuck below $105KDon’t rule out a wild runDespite the optimism, Melker tempered expectations, noting that most experts are forecasting cycle highs between $120,000 and $150,000. Still, he emphasized that wild surges are not out of the ordinary in crypto.“From the 2020 lows to the last bull market, Bitcoin went from $3,000 to $69,000.

2025-05-17T09:12:28.000Z,"Everstake defends non-custodial staking as SEC weighs industry input","The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has held discussions with Everstake, one of the largest non-custodial staking providers globally, to explore clearer regulatory definitions around staking in blockchain networks.The meeting, which also involved the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, comes at a time when over $193 billion in digital assets are staked across major proof-of-stake (PoS) networks.However, despite the massive scale of participation, staking remains in a legal gray zone in the US as regulators wrestle with its classification under existing securities law.The previous SEC administration also took enforcement actions against major players such as Kraken, Coinbase, and Consensys due to their staking services. The agency, under pro-crypto President Donald Trump, has recently dismissed these enforcement actions.During the meeting, Everstake told the SEC that non-custodial staking should not be classified as a securities transaction. The company said that users maintain full control over their digital assets throughout the staking process and do not transfer ownership to a third party.They argued that this makes staking a technical function, not an investment product.“Our main assertion is that staking is not a financial instrument or security transaction, but rather a technical process, a base-layer protocol mechanism—akin to an oracle in a database—that maintains the integrity and functionality of decentralized networks,” Everstake founder Sergii Vasylchuk told Cointelegraph.Everstake team meeting with the SEC. Source: EverstakeRelated: SEC delays staking decision for Grayscale ETH ETFsEverstake calls for regulatory clarityIn a letter submitted to the SEC’s Crypto Task Force on April 8, 2025, Everstake asked the agency to extend regulatory clarity to non-custodial staking and custodial and liquid staking models.In the letter, which came in respond to Commissioner Hester Peirce’s call for input on regulatory treatment of blockchain services, Everstake argued that non-custodial staking should not be considered a securities offering.It claimed that non-custodial staking, where users retain control of their tokens, does not involve the pooling of assets or the expectation of profits from managerial efforts.In its model, Everstake said users delegate only validation rights while maintaining ownership of their digital assets. The staking rewards are algorithmically distributed by the blockchain network itself, and the firm merely provides technical infrastructure.Related: Ethereum ETF staking will have little impact without multimonth rally: AnalystNon-custodial staking fails the Howey testThe letter also details why non-custodial staking fails each prong of the Howey test. Users do not make an investment of money in a common enterprise, do not expect profits from Everstake’s efforts, and are not dependent on the company’s management for financial returns.Instead, any rewards come from network-level incentives and fluctuate with the market value of the underlying asset.Everstake proposes specific criteria that should exempt non-custodial staking from securities classification. These include user asset control, absence of pooled funds, permissionless unstaking, and the provision of purely technical services.It likens non-custodial staking to proof-of-work mining, which the SEC has previously ruled out as a securities transaction.Margaret Rosenfeld, Everstake’s chief legal officer, also told Cointelegraph that “with non-custodial staking, there’s no handover of assets, no investment contract, and no third-party risk.” She added:“Treating it as a securities offering undermines the decentralized model and risks chilling innovation in the blockchain sector.”Nevertheless, the SEC has so far withheld a definitive stance. Rosenfeld said that the agency did not make any “specific commitments” on staking guidance. However, it continues to listen to industry stakeholders.“The Task Force is actively engaging with a range of stakeholders—including those involved with non-custodial staking, ETFs, and broader blockchain infrastructure—to gather input.”In an April 30 letter to the SEC, nearly 30 crypto advocate groups led by the lobby group the Crypto Council for Innovation (CCI) asked the agency for clear regulatory guidance on crypto staking and staking services.Magazine: Binance Wallet ‘killing’ MetaMask and airdrops, Chinese RWA tokens: Asia Express",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/everstake-defends-non-everstake-sec-non-custodial-staking-guidance-staking-as-sec-weighs-industry-input?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

On-chain data suggests the current profit taking is too weak to extinguish Bitcoin’s current price momentum. Bitcoin (BTC) price has spent the bulk of the week pinned below $104,000 to $105,000, which many analysts have labelled as a resistance zone, but an alternative view suggests that BTC is simply consolidating within a bull flag. A bull flag is a continuation pattern that is characterized by a period of sideways price action following a sharp uptrend, and when the structure confirms or breaks from the trendline resistance, the uptrend continues. BTC/USDT 1-day chart. Source: TRDR.ioWhile the range-bound trading portion of the flag is said to represent indecision from buyers and sellers, in this scenario, the absence of buy volume is the primary culprit. As shown in the TRDR.io chart below, Bitcoin’s explosive move to $105,900 from $74,400 was accompanied by large liquidations in the margin markets and robust spot volumes, which aligned with several days of billion-dollar spot BTC ETF inflows. BTC/USDT 1hr chart.

The spot and futures cumulative volume delta, along with the open interest metric on the chart show traders selling near the range highs and the absence of new long leverage and significantly sized spot positions being opened in this area, whereas drops to range low (bull flag support) sees bids filled on the spot side, but there is still limited use of margin for fresh longs. BTC/USD spot and margin CVD. Source: TRDR.ioBitcoin’s recent cool-down phase is a normal outcome after the near 40% recovery that started on April 8, and the loss of upward momentum resulting from profit-taking in futures markets near the current range high is also to be expected. Bitcoin short-term holder supply profit and loss data from Glassnode supports this view, as shown in the chart below. The onchain data company highlighted profit taking for short-term traders but explained that it does not exceed the statistical norm, leaving room for further price upside. “Recently, the magnitude of STH Realized Profit has surged to almost +3 standard deviations above its 90-day average, reflecting a notable uptick in profit realization. In past cycles, particularly during rallies towards the ATH, this metric has historically climbed to over +5 standard deviations of more.

And so we think it makes it a lot easier to be exchanged, a lot more accessible for everybody.”Robinhood's Johann Kerbrat at Consensus 2025. Source: CointelegraphRobinhood has been one of a handful of investment firms or brokerages that have explored RWA tokenization in recent months. Others include BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, Apollo, and VanEck.RWA tokenization is often touted as a means to enhance financial accessibility, with most tokenized funds currently concentrated on the private credit and US treasury markets. According to RWA.xyz on May 16, the total market capitalization of onchain RWA is $22.5 billion across just 101,457 asset holders. On average, each holder owns $221,867 in onchain assets.Related: MultiBank, MAG, Mavryk ink world’s largest $3B RWA tokenization dealStablecoin evolution will create more ‘specialized’ tokensKerbrat also touched on stablecoins, which have emerged as a key crypto use case this cycle. “You will see 100 stablecoins,” he predicted. Kerbrat expects a rise in stablecoins that are “more specialized in a specific market.” According to DefiLlama, dollar-pegged stablecoins dominate the stablecoin sector. The two largest, Tether’s USDt (USDT) and Circle’s USDC (USDC), account for $211.8 billion or 87.1% of the $243.3 billion stablecoin market cap.“If you're trying to move funds from the US to Singapore, maybe you will use a specific stablecoin,” he said. \""The shift is going to go from just stablecoin to platforms that are managing all these stablecoins.”Tether's USDT has seen its market share surge over the past few years.

This has additional benefits for data transmission in space, Belcher said.“The architecture is well-suited to space because it reduces delays, compensates for data corruption caused by radiation, and enables cryptographic verification to ensure data has not been tampered with,” she said.The foundation is a nonprofit governing the decentralized cloud storage protocol Filecoin (FIL), which uses the IPFS web protocol to store data. Lockheed Martin is one of the world’s largest aerospace companies.Source: Filecoin FoundationDecentralized storage benefits“There’s a multi-second delay from the Moon and a multi-minute delay from Mars,” Belcher said.“With IPFS, you look for a content ID and retrieve the data from wherever is closest — your own device, a nearby satellite, or a lunar station.”Additionally, the IPFS uses a distributed architecture to store multiple copies of data across a global network, reducing reliance on centralized data centers.These multiple copies of data improve reliability in environments where hardware is prone to degradation, helping to ensure the integrity of sensitive materials such as satellite images, according to Belcher.Interest in decentralized archival storage is growing among media companies, and the Foundation is also exploring potential military applications of this technology, Belcher said.“It could be really powerful for media in general to have that deep archive and also the ability to have your records everywhere all over the world when needed,” she said.The FIL token is a utility token that can be used within the Filecoin ecosystem. It has a total market capitalization of approximately $1.8 billion as of May 16, according to Cointelegraph data.
