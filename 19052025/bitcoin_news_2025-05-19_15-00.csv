2025-05-19T12:50:40.000Z,"Crypto bull run intact despite weekend volatility in Bitcoin","Bitcoin saw a classic weekend pump-and-dump, with price now sitting at a critical support level. Despite the drop, the market structure remains bullish and poised for another breakout. Bitcoin ( BTC ) opened the week with a sharp retracement after an unsustainable Sunday rally pushed prices higher. The impulsive sell-off into Monday brought the asset back to a crucial support zone, yet the broader picture remains optimistic. Bitcoin continues to trade within a well-defined bullish channel, and the current correction is retesting key levels that could act as a launchpad for the next leg up. If this zone holds, there’s a strong case for Bitcoin pushing to new all-time highs in the coming days. Key technical points Bitcoin is still respecting its bullish ascending channel, holding higher highs and higher lows. Price is testing a support confluence zone at $102,790, the 0.618 Fibonacci, the VWAP, and the channel low. Bullish structure remains intact, despite the short-term volatility after the weekend spike. BTCUSDT (4H) Chart, Source: TradingView The corrective move seen over the past 24 hours is characteristic of weekend-driven volatility, where thin Sunday volume can lead to exaggerated price swings. While the pullback may seem dramatic on lower timeframes, it has delivered Bitcoin to a significant technical zone with multiple levels of confluence. This makes the current area not just a support level, but a potential accumulation zone. Importantly, the broader market structure remains bullish. Bitcoin continues to form higher highs and higher lows, and the ascending trading channel has held firm through the recent retracement. Holding this support region could establish the foundation for the next bullish rotation. Technically, it’s a high-probability zone for long setups, provided price consolidates and begins forming a base on intraday charts. You might also like: The new web3 paradigm: Why LayerK is built for a post-big tech internet From here, Bitcoin must stabilize above this support confluence and establish a bottoming formation, a typical precursor to renewed momentum. If successful, this would open the door to a move toward the channel’s upper boundary. That upper trendline, which hasn’t been tested during the current move, remains a likely price target if bullish momentum returns. What to expect in the coming price action Bitcoin continues to hold a bullish narrative despite recent weekend volatility. If current support levels remain intact, price is likely to rotate higher and make another attempt at all-time highs this week. A brief period of consolidation at these levels could represent the calm before the next breakout.

Here is the Latest Purchase Amount","Japanese investment firm Metaplanet has strengthened its aggressive accumulation strategy by adding another 1,004 Bitcoin (BTC) to its corporate treasury, bringing its total assets to 7,800 BTC. Metaplanet Buys 1,004 More Bitcoins for $104 Million, Bringing Total Assets Near $806 Million The company announced on Monday that the latest purchase, valued at $104.3 million, was made at an average price of $103,873 per bitcoin. This brings Metaplanet’s total Bitcoin investment to approximately $712.5 million, acquired at an average cost of $91,343 per BTC, according to CEO Simon Gerovich. At current market prices — with Bitcoin trading at $103,343, according to The Block’s price page — Metaplanet’s BTC stash is currently worth around $806 million. Often referred to as the “MicroStrategy of Asia” due to its Bitcoin-heavy corporate strategy, Metaplanet began accumulating BTC in April 2024 and has been steadily increasing its purchases in pursuit of its goal of 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025. The Tokyo-listed firm has primarily funded its bitcoin purchases through a series of bond issues. The $15 million bond issue announced last week was its 15th since launching the crypto-focused strategy. According to data from Bitcointreasuries.net, Metaplanet is currently the largest publicly traded institutional Bitcoin holder in Asia and 11th globally, falling behind only US-based firms like MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, which maintains its global lead with 568,840 BTC. The firm’s BTC accumulation strategy appears to be paying off, at least in terms of investor sentiment. Shares of Metaplanet were up 12.2% in Japan on Monday, with trading still ongoing, according to Yahoo Finance. The purchase comes as Bitcoin continues to trade near all-time highs. While the asset has been relatively sideways over the past 24 hours, it has seen renewed bullish momentum in recent weeks spurred by institutional inflows and strong ETF performance. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-19T12:38:24.000Z,"Never sell your Bitcoin — unless you’re Willy Woo? Crypto X purists pounce on influencer for strategy","Most people on crypto X are familiar with the “Never sell your Bitcoin” maxim. However, on May 13, one of the prominent Bitcoin influencers, trader and investor Willy Woo, admitted he is selling his holdings to invest in Bitcoin infrastructure instead. The post sparked debates and was booed by many in the crypto community. However, Woo presented some rationale in defense of his decision. Woo isn’t bearish on Bitcoin Willy Woo is far from being somewhat bearish on Bitcoin. Just a week before publicly claiming that he was getting rid of his BTC, he predicted that Bitcoin dominance would surpass 90% in the next 15 years. Woo has been an avid Bitcoin trader and market expert for many years. His revelation about selling BTC to invest in Bitcoin infrastructure companies came up totally unprovoked. He just replied to the tweet of a popular X account The Bitcoin Therapist, who calls everyone who is selling bitcoins “retards” more or less on a daily basis. Replying to one such post, Woo admitted that he had actually just sold some of his BTC to a contractor doing some work for him, adding, “This is how BTC wins. Adoption.” When the Bitcoin Therapist referred to this as a charitable donation, Woo said that he is getting rid of all his BTC now, “Buying BTC infrastructure companies with it.” TBH I’m in the process of getting rid of all my BTC. Buying BTC infrastructure companies with it. But to your point there was a time when BTC was climbing by 30% per week and OGs were giving away 5BTC at a time via faucets in order to support the network with new users. — Willy Woo (@woonomic) May 14, 2025 To explain his decision, Woo provided an example of himself investing in Exodus Wallet in 2016. According to Woo, the profits made from this investment are 2.5 times bigger now than the profits from the Bitcoin investment made at that time. He noted that nowadays, Bitcoin startups have Bitcoin treasuries, and if the startup itself turns out to be a failure, the BTC treasury may mitigate the risks. However, in the event of a startup’s success, it is possible to gain much more than by investing solely in Bitcoin. Excuse my language but you would have to be fucking retarded to sell your bitcoin right now. — The ₿itcoin Therapist (@TheBTCTherapist) May 13, 2025 Although Woo presented his vision, few to no people on X found it convincing. In the comment section, people referred to it as a mistake; some expressed suspicion that Woo is probably hinting at a soon-to-come correction. When the Bitcoin Therapist posted a screenshot of Woo’s revelation, captioning it “Legendary trader Willy Woo, says he’s selling his Bitcoin to buy infrastructure companies,” many people questioned the “legendary” status itself, called Woo names, or dismissed Woo, saying that he is “not the same” after mistakes he has been doing since 2021. Generally, a screenshot of his post taken out of context was ridiculed and received severe backlash. LOL. Selling the actual infrastructure — the literal foundation of everything — to buy “infrastructure companies” Everyone of these infra & treasuries companies will be buying Bitcoin. https://t.co/AXkk8tD8Pl — Sina 🗝️⚡ 21st Capital (@Sina_21st) May 14, 2025 However, a rare voice of support, product builder Dan Sanchez, replied to the screenshot, noting that he has been paying people with BTC and, although he may have missed huge returns because of this, “the bigger incentive is making an impact on people that provide real value.” I've spent a lot of my Bitcoin on domains, projects, logos, people, data, and other resources. Does it freak me out that I could have WAY more liquidity than I do now? Sure does. The bigger incentive is making an impact on people that provide real value, so that they themselves… — Dan Sanchez (BitcoinMedia.com) 🟠 (@DanSanchez) May 14, 2025 In December 2024, it was reported that Willy Woo invested in Debifi, a noncustodial platform facilitating Bitcoin-backed lending. Woo sees the platform not just as a lending platform but rather as a tool that allows long-term holders to borrow more funds without having to sell their holdings. David Bailey vs subscribers Just hours after the fuss surrounding Woo’s alleged Bitcoin sale, David Bailey of Bitcoin Magazine and Nakamoto, a new company following the steps of Strategy, got in an argument with his subscribers on X. The dispute erupted as Bailey asked what’s wrong with selling bitcoins to buy back discounted shares of his company, Nakamoto (NAV). Read more: Michael Saylor Asserts MicroStrategy Will Never Sell Its Bitcoin There were various responses, with commenters not only showcasing a strong “Never sell Bitcoin” stance but also emphasizing that selling Bitcoin would send the market a signal that won’t land well for Nakamoto. For instance, it can be a signal that the company’s trust in Bitcoin is weak, which is not a good look for a company built around the idea of relentless Bitcoin accumulation. Another argument against trading Bitcoin is that it may signal weakness of the NAV shares themselves. If a company is trading below 1 NAV the market is likely worried about future default risk / too much leverage. So selling bitcoin to buy back shares would shrink the asset base, leave liabilities unchanged, and increase the company’s leverage ratio further. — Joe Burnett, MSBA (@IIICapital) May 14, 2025 Bailey didn’t agree with anyone. He posted another tweet, guessing that people in the comment section simply cannot distinguish arbitrating from selling, adding, “I feel like I’m taking crazy pills reading these comments, lol.” This is going to sound crazy but the biggest issue with a Bitcoin Treasury Co selling btc will be the psychological factor that a BTC Co is actually selling Bitcoin. — TO (@TheOneNotChosen) May 14, 2025 Plan B’s case Plan B is a prominent Bitcoin influencer and popularizer of adopting the Stock-to-Flow model for Bitcoin price analysis. Plan B made headlines in February when he revealed that he is moving his Bitcoin holdings to ETFs to reach “peace of mind” and avoid problems with private key management. ⚠️ Disclosure ⚠️ I have transferred my bitcoin to ETFs. Yes I know, not your keys not your coins. But it is just easier for me to manage bitcoin the same way as equities and bonds. Also, not having to hassle with keys gives me peace of mind. I guess I am not a maxi anymore. — PlanB (@100trillionUSD) February 15, 2025 The move triggered much criticism, both from Bitcoin maxis and Bitcoin skeptics. As for the latter, economist Peter Schiff referred to Plan B’s switch to ETFs as “another example of Bitcoin not fulfilling its supposed purpose.” Bitcoiners criticized Plan B for entrusting control over his funds to a third party. That’s not about being a maxi or not… It’s about the individual decision of having an asset in your control or not. Do you trust yourself or do you trust someone else? — Dan Held (@danheld) February 15, 2025 Just like in the case of Bailey and Woo, selling Bitcoin, no matter for what purpose, is met with dismay and disapproval. So, never sell your Bitcoin. Or, perhaps, sell it in secret.

No company has leaned harder into crypto than this one – making it one of the largest corporate Bitcoin holders. At the heart of it all is Michael Saylor. Come what may – praise or harsh criticism, Saylor doesn’t budge from his belief that Bitcoin is “digital gold”. “My formula for success is rise early, work late, and buy Bitcoin,” But lately, that no-brakes approach is starting to raise more than just eyebrows. A fresh lawsuit is now questioning whether the company’s obsession with Bitcoin might be more reckless than revolutionary. And just when you think they’d pull back, they double down with another massive BTC buy. What is going on? Investors Push Back: Strategy Slapped With Class Action Lawsuit MicroStrategy (MSTR) is staring down a class action lawsuit filed in the Eastern District of Virginia . The case, led by Pomerantz LLP , targets the firm and key executives for allegedly misleading investors over the financial impact of new Bitcoin accounting rules. What is this all about? ASU 2023-08 , a standard requiring companies to reflect Bitcoin’s market value on their balance sheets. According to the suit, Strategy failed to adequately warn investors of the potential $5.91 billion fair-value loss under the updated rules. The complaint also accuses the company of sugarcoating reality through made-up metrics like “BTC Yield” and “BTC $ Gain,” painting a far rosier picture of profitability than GAAP numbers would support. It didn’t go unnoticed. On April 7 , after the $5.9B bombshell surfaced, MSTR stock dropped 8.67% . By May 1 , earnings confirmed the dent – and investors weren’t amused. And that’s when things came crumbling down. Meanwhile, Another Bitcoin Buy? If you thought the lawsuit might slow Strategy down, think again. According to a May 19 filing, the company has snapped up another 7,390 BTC – worth $764.9 million – at an average price of $103,498 per coin. The purchase was funded through an ATM equity offering and newly issued Series A STRK preferred stock . That brings Strategy’s total stash to 576,230 BTC , now valued around $59 billion , with a new average cost basis of $69,726 . A Strategy Set in Stone Here’s what’s odd: a high-stakes lawsuit, billions in reported losses, and yet – business as usual. There’s no sign of a pivot. No course correction.

The cryptocurrency market capitalization decreased by 3.3% over the last 24 hours, now standing at $3.36 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $141 billion at the time of writing. TLDR: The market has seen drops across the board: liquidations pushing it down, ETF inflows pulling it up; BTC briefly hit the weekly high of $106,518, before pulling back to $103,011; Bitcoin may surge to $136,000 soon; Spot ETFs continue to see investor interest, hitting weekly net inflows of $608.4 million; Analysts expect a short-term pullback, driven by short-term liquidations; While the dip seems unstainable, negative news or regulations may prolong it. Why Is Crypto Down Today – May 19, 2025: Crypto Winners & Losers Not a single coin among the top 10 coins per market cap has seen its price increase today. Ethereum (ETH) recorded the highest loss. It’s down 4.8% to the price of $2,386. The smallest decrease is recorded by Bitcoin (BTC) , having dropped 0.9%, now trading at $103,011. This is a significant pullback from the briefly held daily high of $106,518. Notably, this was also its high for the past week.

Source: Coinglass Bitcoin May Surge to $136,000 Soon John Glover, Chief Investment Officer at crypto lending platform Ledn and former Barclays managing director, says he expects to see a short-lived Bitcoin correction before the next leg higher towards $136,000. “The BTC price action is tracking the projected line nicely,” Glover says. He expects a short-lived correction into the mid-$80,000 region to complete wave (ii) of Wave 5. Once that wave is done, the next impulsive move would be higher to target $120,000, with the ultimate target of $136,000 later in the year or early next year “to complete Wave 5 (orange line) of the bull run.” Per Glover, “keep in mind that wave (i) can be completely retraced by wave (ii), so a retest of the $74,5000 low of Wave IV is not out of the question. But my expectations continue to be for a rally to $133,000-$136,000 into the end of this year/beginning of next.” Source: John Glover, Ledn Meanwhile, Adam Back, CEO of blockchain tech company Blockstream , recently argued that BTC is significantly undervalued and could hit $1 million per coin during the current market cycle. He said that the four-year cycle in BTC’s price action stretches with time and that we’re early in this cycle. “I’m thinking this cycle could get quite high $500,000 to $1 million, because there’s a lot going on.” The catalysts include the US approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and crypto-friendly political approach in that country, Back said.

The coin is currently hovering around $103,000, signaling a short-term weakness. Nonetheless, a drop below the psychological level of $100,000 and the technical level of $98,000 could lead to further downside. According to the latest Glassnode report, a key accumulation zone has been between $93,000 and $95,000. This zone will likely act as a strong support level in case of a short-term market pullback such as this one. It will be “a demand zone where investors are likely to see value once again.” Source: Glassnode Moreover, the Fear and Greed Index has stood at 71 for several days now. While it may indicate a rise in optimism and buying activity, the downside is that it may also suggest overconfidence and overvaluation. That said, the price is still supported by consistent spot ETF inflows and major macro factors. Inflation, tariff deals, and other economic factors are turning investor interest towards safe assets, including digital assets. For the week ending 16 May, US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs saw net inflows totaling $608.4 million, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) leading the pack. Furthermore, Metaplanet has purchased an additional 1,004 BTC on Monday. This is Asia’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder, and the purchase is part of its Bitcoin accumulation strategy. This acquisition has increased its total holdings to 7,800 BTC.

(@Metaplanet_JP) May 19, 2025 Quick FAQ Why did crypto move against stocks today? The broader crypto market has seen notable volatility and downward pressure today due to high leverage and liquidations. On the other hand, the US stock markets posted gains due to the increase in investor and macro optimism. For example, the S&P 500 is up 0.7% today, the Nasdaq-100 has increased by 0.43%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up by 0.78%. Is this dip sustainable? The current sell-off may be unsustainable, given the consistent institutional interest. The dip is likely a pullback triggered by liquidations across long and short positions. However, negative news or regulatory shifts, combined with the volatility, may trigger an additional correction.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) fell to $102,870 after trading near the $106,000 level on Sunday. Ethereum ( ETH ) declined to $2,400, while the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies dropped by 1.67% to $3.25 trillion. The selling pressure mirrored the broader financial market, with futures tied to the Nasdaq 100, Russell 2000, and S&P 500 all down over 1%. Dow Jones futures slipped by 0.70%. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana prices chart | Source: crypto.news Bitcoin and crypto prices fell after Moody’s US downgrade Stocks and crypto fell as investors reacted to Moody’s decision to downgrade the US credit rating . In a statement on Friday, the agency warned that the country’s fiscal outlook was deteriorating. The US Debt Clock shows the national debt has risen to over $36.8 trillion, up from $21 trillion in 2020. That figure is expected to rise further following a new agreement in the House on the so-called Big, Beautiful Bill. You might also like: Bitcoin’s institutionalization puts brakes on wild rallies, analyst says The bill includes tax cuts estimated to cost between $4.5 trillion and $5 trillion over the next decade, partially offset by projected spending cuts of $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion. Historically, markets have reacted negatively to credit rating downgrades of major economies. Stocks and cryptocurrencies declined on August 1, 2023, when Fitch downgraded the U.S. from AAA to AA+. A similar move occurred on August 5–6, 2011, when S&P Global made the same downgrade. Some analysts, however, downplayed the impact of Moody’s decision. In a post on X, Jim Bianco called the downgrade a “nothingburger.” Why the Moody’s downgrade of the US SHOULD BE a nothingburger —- In August 2011, S&P went first and downgraded the US from AAA to AA+. All hell broke loose. The reason hell broke loose was a lot of derivative contract, loan agreements, investment directives and the like… https://t.co/YLq29uKcyZ — Jim Bianco (@biancoresearch) May 16, 2025 In theory, the deteriorating US public finances is a bullish catalyst for Bitcoin, an asset that is slowly becoming a safe-haven asset. In a lengthy white-paper , BlackRock argued that Bitcoin was becoming a good asset to hedge against the soaring US debt and the rising risk of a default. BlackRock noted that Bitcoin was a “scarce, non-sovereign, decentralized asset with a limited supply.” Since that paper’s release, Bitcoin’s fundamentals have improved. Supply on exchanges and in over-the-counter markets has dropped to multi-year lows, while demand via exchange-traded funds has surged. Cumulative inflows into spot Bitcoin funds have surpassed $41 billion. More companies are also adding Bitcoin to their treasuries. Therefore, Bitcoin and crypto prices will likely bounce back from this panic. For example, most altcoins have rallied in the past few weeks as the Liberation Day tariffs fears eased.

2025-05-19T12:28:22.000Z,"Ethereum Gets Rejected From a Crucial Range-Will This Hinder the ETH Price Rally to $3000?","The post Ethereum Gets Rejected From a Crucial Range-Will This Hinder the ETH Price Rally to $3000? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum has been displaying massive strength and outperforming most of the cryptos, including Bitcoin. The price surged and reached the crucial resistance levels, not seen since February but failed to surpass the range, resulting in a notable pullback. Previously, the rejection from the range had dragged the levels towards the lows below $1400. So the question arises whether the ETH price will revive a strong upswing to $3000. Regardless of the long-term price action, the ETH price is poised for a strong upswing in the short term as the 50/200-day MAs have undergone a golden cross. However, in the long term, the price is expected to face some upward pressure as the token has dropped below a crucial resistance zone. Previously, a strong buying volume followed this rejection, which pushed the price to $4000. The ETH price has witnessed its strongest 1-month rise in recent times after the rebound it underwent on April 7, 2025. Meanwhile, the price faced extreme upward pressure last week, which stopped the rally and got rejected exactly at the 50-day weekly MA. This rebound is technically the new bullish leg of the multi-year rising wedge. The 1-week MA 50 turned into a resistance when it last broke on the week of January 27, 2025. Once it breaks and closes above the range, one can expect a strong bullish upswing that happened during late 2024. Therefore, all eyes will now be on the current weekly close, which is now expected to rise above the 200-day weekly MA and surpass the 50-day MA. As the weekly MACD has already turned bullish, the ETH price is believed to revive a strong rise back to the psychological barrier at $4000. However, breaking this barrier is extremely crucial to keep up the bullish trend towards a new ATH.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/ethereum-gets-rejected-from-a-crucial-range-will-this-hinder-the-eth-price-rally-to-3000/,"BTC|ETH|TRADING","Price Analysis|Ethereum",cryptocompare

The rally has been clearly spot-driven , characterised by impulse moves higher following short, well-defined consolidation phases. This pattern suggests healthy accumulation and strong underlying demand rather than speculative excess. Spot Cumulative Volume Delta across major exchanges has remained positive, reinforcing the view that real buyers—rather than leveraged traders—are dominating the market. Meanwhile, derivatives positioning has been reactive , with open interest fluctuations highlighting a transition period marked by short squeezes and liquidation-driven resets. The result is a healthier foundation, with speculative froth cleared and momentum now underpinned by genuine capital flows. With Bitcoin just off its All-Time High, and spot premium remaining elevated, the current range-bound price action may simply represent a period of stabilisation before a potential breakout. While short-term pullbacks are still likely, the broader trend remains firmly constructive. That said warning signs continue to flash across the US economy, as inflation cools but deeper structural risks begin to surface. The Consumer Price Index rose just 0.2 percent month-over-month in April, and is up just 2.3 percent on the year—the lowest annual gain since early 2021. A drop in food prices helped ease the pressure from shelter costs, but the outlook remains clouded by uncertainty over tariffs and trade policy. Despite a temporary truce between the US and China, sweeping import tariffs remain, with more potentially on the way by July. These unresolved trade tensions create significant challenges for businesses and policymakers alike. At the same time, financial strain is building at the household level. Recent data from the New York Fed show a rise in 90+ day delinquencies on credit card and student loan balances, underscoring the fragile state of consumer finances. As tariffs begin to bite and inflation risks linger, the combination of slowing growth and rising prices—potential stagflation—could leave the Federal Reserve in a difficult position. For now, with core services and housing costs still elevated, the Fed is likely to remain cautious. But with economic pressures mounting, the coming months will demand both flexibility and vigilance. Institutional and corporate adoption of Bitcoin continues to grow, even amid market dips and regulatory uncertainty. Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment Company increased its holdings in BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) during Q1 2025, signalling long-term confidence despite a temporary drop in the ETF’s market value. Since its January 2024 launch, IBIT has led the US market for spot ETFs, drawing over $45.5 billion in inflows and managing $65.4 billion in assets. In Latin America, Brazilian fintech Méliuz became the region’s first public company to adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy. After purchasing 274.52 BTC worth $28.4 million, its total holdings now exceed 320 BTC. The move was backed by shareholders and was followed by a 116 percent surge in the company’s stock, reflecting strong investor support for crypto-based financial strategies. Meanwhile, the legal landscape remains tense. A US judge rejected a joint request from the SEC and Ripple to ease penalties and lift restrictions, citing procedural errors due to the case being under appeal. The decision stalls a potential settlement in a landmark case that could shape the future of crypto regulation in the US. Together, these events highlight both the momentum and the hurdles facing crypto’s growing role in finance.

Announced on May 19, this marks the company’s second-largest Bitcoin buy to date, as the cryptocurrency continues to hover just below its all-time high. With this acquisition, Metaplanet’s total Bitcoin holdings now stand at 7,800 BTC, valued at roughly $807 million at current market prices. The purchase follows closely behind its largest single buy of 1,241 BTC on May 12 for $129 million, a transaction that pushed its reserves past those of El Salvador. Metaplanet is now the largest corporate BTC holder in Asia and ranks tenth globally, according to data from BiTBO. The company has demonstrated a strong return on its BTC investment strategy. It posted a Bitcoin yield of 95.6% in the first quarter and has already achieved a 47.8% yield in the second quarter. This yield reflects the percentage growth in BTC holdings per fully diluted share, highlighting Metaplanet’s aggressive and consistent accumulation strategy. Closing in on Galaxy Digital’s Position If Metaplanet adds another 301 BTC to its balance sheet, it will surpass Galaxy Digital Holdings, which currently sits in ninth place among public companies with 8,100 BTC. At the top of the leaderboard remains Michael Saylor’s firm, Strategy, with a commanding 568,840 BTC—worth around $59 billion—under management. Metaplanet has notably ramped up its Bitcoin purchases in recent months. So far in May alone, the firm has added 2,800 BTC. In April, it made four separate buys totaling 794 BTC, and in March, six purchases brought in a combined 1,655 BTC. Michael Saylor Teases New Bitcoin Buy Meanwhile, Strategy founder Michael Saylor hinted at another upcoming purchase by sharing a screenshot of the firm’s BTC portfolio tracker on social media platform X, accompanied by the cryptic phrase, “Never short a man who buys orange ink by the barrel.” Strategy continues to lead all corporate buyers with 77% of the growth in corporate-held Bitcoin this year, according to investment firm River. River’s May 12 report also revealed that corporations have outpaced all other sectors—including ETFs, governments, and retail investors—as the largest net buyers of Bitcoin in 2025. With institutional momentum building and prices nearing historic highs, Metaplanet’s aggressive strategy may signal broader corporate conviction in BTC’s long-term value.

Today, Bitcoin even touched a high near $107,000 —fueling excitement among crypto investors. A key factor in this bullish trend is El Salvador’s bold Bitcoin investment strategy , which has generated impressive returns. Recently, El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele revealed via an X post that the country’s Bitcoin holdings have yielded over $357 million in unrealized profit . Let’s dive deeper into this developing story. El Salvador’s Bitcoin Investment Strategy: Key Facts El Salvador became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021 , signaling its strong pro-crypto stance. According to El Salvador’s Bitcoin Office, the country currently holds 6,181 BTC , valued around $639 million at current prices. El Salvador’s BTC Holdings: $357 Million Unrealized Profit President Bukele’s recent X post confirmed the unrealized gains from their Bitcoin holdings: “Our BTC holdings have generated over $357 million in unrealized profit.” View Bukele’s post on X With the BTC price around $102K per token, the total value of El Salvador’s holdings stands at roughly $644 million .

A law was passed making Bitcoin usage voluntary for the private sector , not mandatory. Many global critics and some Bitcoin supporters have distanced themselves from El Salvador’s approach. However, President Bukele remains firm in his commitment: “If it didn’t stop when the world ostracised us and most ‘bitcoiners’ abandoned us, it won’t stop now, and it won’t stop in the future.” What This Means for Bitcoin’s Future El Salvador’s successful BTC investment highlights growing acceptance and confidence in Bitcoin as an asset and legal tender.

Here Are the Details…","Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States, is facing a new lawsuit in the country. Accordingly, Coinbase is facing a class action lawsuit in the US state of Illinois over an alleged biometric data breach. Following the conclusion of its lawsuit with the SEC, Coinbase has faced new litigation, with a group of Coinbase users in the state of Illinois filing a class-action lawsuit against the exchange, alleging that the exchange’s identity checks violate the state’s Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA). Users allege in the lawsuit that Coinbase required users to verify their identity with a government-issued ID and processed the collection, storage, or sharing of biometric data without written notice or proper consent, thereby violating BIPA. The plaintiffs allege that Coinbase failed to inform users in writing about the collection, storage or sharing of their biometric data and the purpose and retention schedule of their data. The plaintiffs also alleged that Coinbase violated the law by sharing biometric data with third-party verification providers such as Jumio, Onfido, Au10tix, and Solaris without users’ consent. “Coinbase does not publicly provide a retention schedule or guidelines for the permanent destruction of Plaintiffs’ biometric identifiers as specified by BIPA.” Coinbase was also hit with a lawsuit filed by a group of Coinbase users in May 2023 alleging similar BIPA violations, but the case was dismissed by a judge. *This is not investment advice.

Here’s what’s driving the hype and the caution. XRP Trend Shifts: Key Weekly EMA & SMA Strategy Analyst EGRAG Crypto’s latest analysis on XRP highlights a trading strategy based on the relationship between the 21-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the 33-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) on the weekly chart. According to EGRAG, these moving averages are key for spotting major trend shifts in the market. If the 21 EMA crosses below the 33 SMA, it signals a bearish trend, and we could be heading into a bear market. Historically, these crosses have led to significant price drops, with XRP falling 87% in May 2018 and 72% in November 2021. The next major drop could be around 79.5% from the bearish cross point. This is a key sell signal as it suggests that the top is in and a steep correction could follow, Egrag explains. Is XRP Entering A Long-Term Uptrend? On the flip side, a 21 EMA crossing above the 33 SMA is seen as a strong bullish signal, often preceding major price rallies. The analyst notes that the past bullish crosses have triggered massive pumps. This could be a sign that the market is entering a long-term uptrend, leading to much higher price levels, like the $5.7, $9.5, $27, and $37 targets mentioned. Double Digits Possible, Say Analysts XRP hitting double digits may sound a bit far-fetched, but history says it’s possible. In 2018, XRP controlled over 31% of the entire crypto market and hit $3.84. Now, in 2025, it’s trading around $3.34 but holds just 5% market share. If XRP reclaims even half of its old market dominance, it could see massive gains. This is especially possible if Bitcoin cools off and altcoins rally later. Will XRP Rally After Futures Launch? CME is launching XRP futures today. Some traders worry that this could lead to a short-term top, as similar futures launches for Bitcoin in 2018 had led to sharp sell-offs later. It had also coincided with the peak of the bull cycle at that time. XRP is currently trading at $2.32, down 2.9% ahead of the launch.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-to-hit-5-9-and-27/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare

2025-05-19T12:07:25.000Z,"Best Presales to Buy as $PEPE, $WIF & $BONK Sales Jump in Widely Anticipated Bull Market","The 24-hour trading volume for meme coins has surged by an astonishing ~60%, causing top tokens in this arena to explode. $PEPE’s daily trading volume has jumped by ~113%, while $WIF and $BONK witnessed significant spikes of ~56% and ~42%, respectively. As they continue to attract the attention of new investors, the best presales to buy right now – like $SUBBD and $MIND – are set for substantial returns. But what’s casting a light on these altcoins, old and new? US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Attract $603M+ Weekly Inflows The resurgence of meme coins is fueled by a broader return of ‘risk-on’ sentiment across crypto markets. It’s partly spurred by inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs, which attracted $600M+ in net capital over the past week. As of May 17, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) has solidified its position as the US spot Bitcoin ETF leader, boasting $63.23B in asset management . Impressively, IBIT nearly takes up half of the total market, which currently stands at $129.14B. This influx of large, long-term capital into $BTC leads to higher liquidity and reduced volatility over time, supporting more sustainable growth for the crypto sector’s bellwether. It has partly spurred $BTC to nudge closer to its $108K ATH ( at ~$103K ), triggering a general upswing in meme coins. Surging trading volumes and renewed risk appetite create the perfect environment for such coins to gain traction – $SUBBD , $MIND , $BDAG, and $BEST might be the next crypto to explode . 1. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) – AI Token Set to Disrupt the $85B Subscription-Based Economy SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) is an AI-Web3 platform that could power the next evolution in the $85B subscription-based creator economy. Backed by 2K+ top-earning influencers and a network of 250M+ followers, it transforms how influencers, creators, and fans connect. Influencers can use their very own AI assistant and boost their revenue by cutting out intermediaries via direct-to-fan monetization. Meanwhile, creators will gain access to AI tools (like a video generator, live streams, voice notes, and a profile creation feature) to automate their actions on the platform. Fans also enjoy their fair share of benefits: exclusive, direct access to their creators and their content, plus loyalty bonuses. $SUBBD unlocks access to exclusive content, beta access, and up to 200% staking rewards, all while offering platform discounts and XP-based rewards. Given that the project has already raised $447K+ on presale, it has what it takes to be a breakout token for the creator economy. You can buy $SUBBD for just $0.05545 before its price increases in two days. It could jump ~442% and reach $0.301 before 2026 gears up , so now’s a favorable time to get involved. 2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – AI Agent That Offers Early Access to Top Crypto Opportunities MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is another AI-focused project. This new meme coin on presale aims to give crypto investors a leg up in the fast-moving crypto trading arena. Merging advanced AI tools, Web3 technology, and community-first tokenomics (15% of its total token supply is earmarked for member rewards), it tackles pressing problems: information overload, market fragmentation, and limited access to early-stage opportunities. The project’s AI agent, MIND, is where the magic happens. By consolidating real-time data, scanning social and DeFi trends, and delivering actionable insights, you can significantly boost your trading tactics. To get involved, you need only buy $MIND on presale , currently for just $0.0037515. Upon doing so, you’ll also gain early access to new cryptocurrencies and presale alerts. Not to mention, for passive income, you can stake the coin at a sizable 238% APY. It’s not surprising that $MIND raised $100M in less than a day of going live and has attracted over $9.5M since. Further fueling the project’s growth are big-time investors, three of whom injected $25,074.33 , $17,386.59 , and $16,634.18 into the presale relatively early on. Additionally, the US administration’s ongoing crypto support could boost the project to greater heights and bring the coin’s value to $0.00535 . Considering that America’s Web3 support is evident, with 14 US states recently adding $632M in Strategy stock to their portfolios, now’s a prime time to engage – and it’s the last call to join the first-movers . 3. BlockDag ($BDAG) – A Scalable Blockchain Token That Merges Bitcoin and Ethereum’s Hottest Features BlockDAG is a new crypto network that combines the best parts of Bitcoin and Ethereum (fast payments and smart contracts) to make these networks faster and more scalable. It achieves this by using a powerful system dubbed ‘GhostDAG,’ which enables multiple blocks to be created at the same time. It can handle thousands of transactions per second, far surpassing the base layers of Bitcoin and Ethereum. It also leverages a hybrid proof-of-work consensus mechanism that ensures high decentralization, plus advanced cryptographic techniques to protect user data. $BDAG, its native token, powers everything on the network. It’s necessary to pay for transaction fees (as low as one cent), launch dApps, tokens, NFTs, and dish out miner rewards. Moreover, it works across both Bitcoin’s UTXO model and Ethereum’s Virtual Machine (EVM) thanks to its 1:1 bridge. Thanks to its EVM compatibility, it can run Ethereum apps, so you can easily build on the network ahead of mainstream adoption. You can join the BlockDAG ecosystem and reap the benefits by purchasing $BDAG on presale for just $0.0020 using various coins, including $BTC, $TRUMP, and $TON. 4. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Low Gas Fees & DAO Rights Within the Best Anonymous Crypto Wallet Another rising utility token is $BEST , the native token of Best Wallet , our #1 anonymous crypto wallet . Beyond its user privacy benefits, Best Wallet’s strengths include its support of over 1K+ cryptos, built-in launchpad, cross-chain swaps, crypto presale aggregator, and unwavering commitment to security. It utilizes Fireblocks’ Multi-Party Computation (MPC) technology to deliver next-gen crypto security without the need for traditional seed phrases. Plus, it’s getting set to launch advanced anti-fraud and MEV protection. In fact, besides safeguarding measures, Best Wallet has tons to look forward to in the pipeline: the support of 60+ blockchain networks, an NFT gallery, and a rewards hub. $BEST serves as both a utility and governance token within the expansive Best Wallet ecosystem. You can buy the coin to enjoy reduced transaction fees, higher staking rewards (at a 117% APY, for the time being), and participate in the project’s future trajectory. After being listed on crypto exchanges , $BEST could reach $0.072 this year. However, it’s currently available for just $0.025045 – a strategic, low-cost entry point before it possibly almost triples in price. The Best Presales Thrive Amid Enhanced Market Interest As the best meme coins to buy now, like $PEPE, $WIF, and $BONK, continue to rally amid favorable crypto developments, like Bitcoin ETFs, new crypto presales – $SUBBD , $MIND , $BDAG, and $BEST – are in the spotlight. Best yet, unlike the meme coin leaders, they’re not speculative assets; they solve real-world problems with cutting-edge tech. Whether you’re interested in new ways to connect with creators, AI-powered insights, next-gen blockchain infrastructure, or crypto wallet perks, they each unlock innovative solutions for everyday traders. However, this isn’t investment advice. Be sure to always do your research and never invest more than you can afford to lose.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/best-presales-right-now-in-anticipated-market-rally/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Crypto News",cryptocompare

2025-05-19T12:00:52.000Z,"Bitcoin ETF open interest dips 5% to $29.47B as BTC holds near $102.9K","US-listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded net inflows of $260.27 million, extending a trend of positive capital movement into digital asset products. However, open interest has now dropped 5% to $29.47 billion, marking a slowdown from recent weeks as Bitcoin’s price struggled to break key resistance levels. The pullback in inflows follows a month-long run of heightened institutional interest, with investors now appearing more cautious. During the five-day period, Bitcoin remained rangebound, trading between $102,711 and $104,971. This consolidation phase likely contributed to the softer demand for ETF exposure. The lower inflow figure also reflects broader macroeconomic uncertainties, with traders reacting to global rate policies and mixed inflation data across key markets. BTC trades sideways near $103K Bitcoin’s lack of decisive price action has curbed some of the aggressive buying seen in prior weeks. On 19 May, BTC briefly touched $107,108 before correcting and is now trading at approximately $102,969. Source: CoinMarketCap This suggests that despite occasional breakouts, strong overhead resistance is dampening short-term momentum. While ETFs remain a key avenue for institutional crypto exposure, last week’s inflow of $260.27 million highlights tempered enthusiasm compared to previous weekly figures that crossed $900 million. The technical indecision may be prompting investors to wait for a more defined trend before deploying fresh capital. Market observers have also noted a shift in investor focus toward other altcoins and layer-2 projects, which have shown stronger relative strength in recent sessions. Derivatives activity Despite slower ETF inflows, data from the derivatives market points to ongoing bullish sentiment. Futures open interest dropped 5% to $29.47 billion. Options market data also reflects positive bias. On 16 May, demand for call options outweighed puts, indicating that traders are positioning for an upward move. This suggests confidence in a possible short-term rebound above recent resistance, with some investors anticipating a push toward the $110,000 mark. Still, analysts warn that leveraged positions may increase volatility, especially if BTC fails to hold above $100,000 in the coming days. Resistance levels remain key to next move Bitcoin’s near-term direction hinges on its ability to break through resistance around $105,000. A convincing move above this level, supported by volume, could reignite ETF inflows and validate bullish positioning in the derivatives market. Until then, institutional interest may continue to moderate. Even with the recent dip in net ETF flows, the broader 2025 trend reflects growing institutional acceptance of Bitcoin. Spot products have made it easier for asset managers to gain exposure without dealing directly with custody or regulatory complexities. As BTC hovers near $102,969, the market awaits a clearer breakout or breakdown. The next move could determine whether this consolidation is merely a pause in a longer uptrend or an early sign of a broader cooldown.

2025-05-19T12:00:45.000Z,"Dogecoin Price Resistance In View: Why The Key Lies At $0.25","Over the last few days, the Dogecoin price has struggled to hold up with the Bitcoin price hitting multiple resistances. This has triggered a wave of liquidations for crypto traders who have been betting on the price to go higher. The decline has also raised concerns as to whether the bullish rally that began at the start of the month is finally over. Dogecoin Price Faces Major Resistance Crypto analyst MindfullyLost has explained what is plaguing the Dogecoin price recently. According to the crypto analyst, the Dogecoin price has seen good support on the 4HR, which has continued to be above $0.21, even through the downtrend. Related Reading: Golden Ratio Multiplier Called Bitcoin Top In 2021 – Here’s What It’s Saying Now Also, when it comes to the hourly chart, there is also support forming for Dogecoin at this level. This comes after a retest of the $0.22 level before the bulls were able to bounce. This shows weakness in this support and could fail with a more dominant move. Presently, there is resistance mounting at $0.23 for the Dogecoin price and the bears are already bearing down on this level. As the crypto analyst shows, a break above this level would be confirmation of the uptrend for the Dogecoin price, making it a buy zone. The next major resistance after this then lies at $0.25 and this is the moment of truth for Dogecoin. Bulls would have to completely test and clear this resistance level. Otherwise, the chances of the price falling back down toward support at $0.21 remain high. What’s Next For DOGE? The Dogecoin price is currently consolidating and according to the crypto analyst, this consolidation could continue for a while. This would translate to sideways price movement for the foreseeable future, as well as a continuation of the battle for dominance between the bears and bulls. Related Reading: Cardano Market Structure Says Crash Is Coming, But $0.9 Is Still In The Cards Bulls would have to start pushing the price higher to actually try to test the first resistance level. Until then, Dogecoin could plunge further into the oversold territory, which would not be entirely bad for the price, making the rebound even stronger. As for how high the Dogecoin price could go if it breaks major resistance levels, some crypto analysts have called for a bounce to at least its previous all-time high at $0.71. While others have speculated that $1 is a natural destination for Dogecoin, and double-digit predictions, such as reaching as high as $10, have also made it to the forefront.

2025-05-19T12:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin: The Rally Continues And I'm Still Behind It","Summary I maintain a bullish stance on Bitcoin due to its increasing popularity, higher trading volumes, and broader adoption by both retail investors and governments. The creation of Bitcoin ETFs has significantly boosted retail investor participation, legitimizing the asset class and driving prices higher. Governments, including the US, are now considering Bitcoin strategic reserves, adding a new layer of legitimacy and potential price support. Despite Bitcoin's volatility and correlation with equities, the declining US dollar and risk-on market sentiment support further gains for BTC. Main Thesis and Background The purpose of this article is to evaluate the broader market as a whole, with a particular focus on why I see a continued bull case for Bitcoin (BTC-USD). This is due to weighing the potential pros and cons of putting money cash into this thematic idea after looking across the investment landscape and seeing which rally really has legs. While BTC has indeed come under pressure this year, it has roared back with a vengeance. Of particular note, this cryptocurrency is up over 66% since I last covered it in Q4 2024: BTC's Performance (Seeking Alpha) Of course, it has not been a straight shot upwards (nothing ever is!). As we have seen a share of volatility in 2025, it should be no surprise that BTC has seen its ups and downs along with the market year-to-date: YTD Performance (Google Finance) With this in mind, I believe it makes sense to take a critical look at BTC to see if further gains are actually possible. It has had quite a run, but sharp sell-offs could spook some investors, and it does make sense to be cautious when an asset (any asset) is outperforming. The good news here - for those who are long or planning to be long BTC - is that I see the trend for BTC continuing in the months to come. I think the bull case remains intact and there are tailwinds swirling around that can push the price higher - despite nearing its all-time high as of the time of writing (5/12). I will discuss my outlook and the rationale behind my continued \""buy\"" rating for this asset in detail below. Interest in Crypto Keeps Surging One of the key reasons I continue to like BTC here has to do with popularity. While that may sound a little juvenile, the fact is that Bitcoin and crypto more broadly continue to become more heavily adopted by the American and global investment community. This has been largely positive for this sector, and we can see this isn't a small development. The trading volumes for BTC in particular have been rising over time and really spiked after the elections here in the US in November. As we moved into 2025, these volumes have remained elevated and that is an encouraging sign: Crypto Volumes (BTC and Total Market) (Coin Metrics) The net result here is that BTC and crypto are not going anywhere. If anything, it is getting more popular with investors big and small and that is bullish for prices in my view. As allocations rise that usually means prices are heading higher - this is because more people want exposure to an asset with some level of scarcity. The view I have is that this remains an emerging asset class despite how long it has been around. The number of investors with exposure remains small compared to other sectors like stocks, bonds, or other commodities. Further, higher volumes can help reduce volatility as a few big traders cannot necessarily dominate prices the way they can if fewer people own the asset. Simply put, the rising trading volumes help support the legitimacy of the sector and I only see this helping BTC going forward. In a Shift, Governments Now Embracing BTC Perhaps one of the most bullish tailwinds I see out there in the market today with respect to crypto (and specifically BTC) is how governments are beginning to embrace the idea rather than restrict. Once skeptical of losing control over currency markets, both governments and central banks are debating how they can use BTC to their advantage. One of the primary ways has been to consider the establishment of Bitcoin \""strategic reserves\"". This allows a government can control and \""own\"" a level of Bitcoin in a manner similar to traditional reserves like gold and the USD. While far from a comparison to those assets right now, it is a move that could put BTC on that path in the future. Under a Trump administration, the US now seems to be on its way to making this a firm reality. In March, the White House released a statement calling for the creation of such a reserve, and I would expect other nations will follow in the short term to avoid falling behind: BTC Policy Announcement (White House) Clearly, we have seen a more \""pro-Bitcoin\"" regulatory environment in the US. The initiation of a strategic reserve as well as some other appointments within the current administration that are proponents of the idea speaks to the general sense that the US is helping to lead the charge to legitimize this currency as a medium of exchange. If we see the US have some early success or wins in this regard, I would expect other developed nations to follow suit. Of course, I am not a US dollar skeptic nor do I think cryptocurrencies are going to \""replace\"" fiat currency. While I see a bull case for Bitcoin continuing, I don't have a complete lack of trust in the currency system like some do who happen to invest in this space! And I would point out that the US dollar remains the far and away favorite for international trade and finance: Percentage Of Currency Use (By Purpose) (Bank for International Settlements) What I am driving at here is I do not want to give the impression that I believe BTC is going to replace traditional currencies around the world. The US dollar remains paramount when it comes to international finance and other currencies - such as the Euro, Yen, British Pound, and Chinese renminbi - are not going anywhere either. I see BTC being a compliment to traditional currencies, not a replacement, and I don't want to lump myself in with the US dollar skeptics out there who dominate many BTC blogs and news articles. That said, I see a world where the US dollar can still remain top dog while BTC can also thrive. That has been happening to date, and I see it continuing in the short term. So I don't see anything insincere about suggesting both have a bright future ahead. The ETF Catalyst Really Delivered My next point is an expansion on a tailwind I talked about in prior reviews. It was the creation and deployment of ETFs on the open market targeting retail investors - giving a plethora of ways to gain exposure to this asset class beyond buying BTC directly. This was central to my prior \""buy\"" calls on BTC because I saw this as a two-fold catalyst. One, it would increase the legitimacy of the cryptocurrency sector to see the major names in investment management offering funds to own exposure. Two, it gave easy and relatively cheap ways for retail investors to buy into this idea, fueling a retail rally that would indeed ultimately materialize. Simply, I saw this as a big win for the sector when it was starting to become a reality, and it has indeed been a win. To understand the significance, we can look at volumes again. As these ETFs hit the market, they saw a surge in demand. This has boosted prices across the sector (for BTC and other cryptos) and has also forced those fund managers to increase their holdings of BTC in order to meet redemptions should they occur. The net result has been a massive piling into BTC by said fund managers who offer these ETFs, and the result has been staggering: BTC Holdings in Publicly Traded, Private Companies, ETFs, & Countries (World Bank) The takeaway for me is that retail buying is being facilitated - in part - by the expansion of ETF products available in the market. This has given non-institutional buyers a way to easily compare and shop for the \""right\"" fund for them, and offers options beyond going on crypto exchanges to purchase BTC. While I, personally, favor that latter approach, I recognize it isn't the best path for everyone given how emerging and confusing this sector can be. In a nutshell, over the past few years, I saw adoption by fund managers of this idea and approval of ETFs as big catalysts for higher prices for BTC. This hypothesis has been vindicated, and I don't believe the thesis has run its course. I see this as support for me buying BTC in the past has worked out well, and I see it as continued support for remaining a bull today. The Dollar's Decline is Helping Push Commodities Higher Another factor behind BTC's rise has been the decline of the value of the US dollar. This has helped crude oil rebound, pushed gold prices to record levels, and, of course, supported higher prices for BTC: USD Index (Bloomberg News) The logic here is pretty straightforward. As long as there is some weakness in the US dollar, I would expect assets priced in the US dollar - such as BTC - to see some support. This is not a \""sure thing\"" by any means, but it does help illustrate how one can tap crypto markets to profit off a falling US dollar. Unless we see the Fed hike interest rates aggressively, which I would not expect this year, then I don't see the US dollar stifling the returns of BTC going forward. Bitcoin is a 'Risk-On' Play, Similar to Tech While I continue to have a favorable view of BTC, we need to remain aware of the risks. One doesn't have to look any further back than April to understand that this is an asset that can be very volatile. The similarity between stocks and BTC is growing increasingly correlated in this regard. While that can be \""good\"" when investors are in risk-on mode, the reverse is also true. This is not an asset I would recommend for those who are risk-averse because the drops can be severe when they occur. Expanding on this, I would note that unlike the ETF adoption thesis, one of my other reasons for buying BTC initially has faded out a bit. This was to act as an equity hedge - hoping that BTC would deliver positive returns even when equity markets are dropping. While there was not much of a correlation when BTC first arrived on the scene, that has changed dramatically. Many of the same market and macro-forces that impact large-cap US stocks are not impacting BTC in a similar fashion. The net result is that BTC's use as a diversifier is starting to come into question: Bitcoin vs. Tech Stocks (US) (Morningstar News) The conclusion I draw is that Bitcoin is doing less to round out a portfolio, and there is less and less chance of this being a true \""hedge\"" when equity markets get rattled. To me, this has become just another asset to buy if one is wanting a risky play that could pay off. That doesn't make it bad, but it does suggest it may not be for everyone. Bottom Line BTC continues its march higher, and I see more gains ahead. While the last time it breached the 100k level it swiftly pulled back, I think the market's resumption of rewarding risky plays will send this cryptocurrency to a new record. With ETFs continuing to bring in retail dollars, global governments warming up to the prospect of owning BTC directly, and the US dollar seeing a push lower, all of this adds up to me liking BTC here. I am therefore keeping the buy rating for this asset in place and suggest that my followers give the idea some consideration at this time.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4787971-bitcoin-rally-continues-im-still-behind-it?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","BTC-USD",cryptocompare
2025-05-19T11:58:43.000Z,"Bitcoin's Volatile Liquidity Run Could Lead to New Record Highs","Bitcoin (BTC) enjoyed its weekly dose of volatility late Sunday, rising to around $107,000, before decisively plunging back to $102,000. The crypto market typically experiences a bump in volatility at this time on Sunday as it coincides with the opening of the CME futures market, which takes a few moments to recalibrate to the lower liquidity 24/7 crypto markets. This weekend was slightly different. Whilst on the surface the price action will go down as a bearish rejection from a key level of resistance, which bitcoin has now failed to break at three attempts. BTC actually spiked first on the CME, indicating that the price action was led by institutional U.S. traders as opposed to retail crypto traders. Over the past few months the CME has often opened lower than it closed on the Friday, creating a \""gap\"" on the chart, which did not occur this week. As price whiplashed around this $5,000 range, the move wiped out liquidity on both sides , creating a rather crucial inflection point. Now, market depth all the way up to $110,000 is minimal compared to limit orders lining the book down to $100,000. This means that any upside thrust will likely take this level out and see bitcoin trade at a new record high. However, it's worth considering the other side of the coin. It is also conceivable that the Sunday evening price action was a typical stop-loss hunt, which involves traders targeting a zone where those in short positions would want to exit, thus creating an impulse in buy pressure as short traders scurry to buy back their position. This strategy often takes place alongside entry into a larger short position. For example, if a trader wants to short BTC with a risk tolerance of 4%, it would be advantageous to open that position at $107,000 with a stop loss at $111,280 as opposed at $105,000 with a stop at $109,200. Astute traders can secure that entry by assessing levels of liquidity and squeezing short positions into closing, which temporarily lifts price to an ideal entry. Either way, with liquidity now relatively low around record highs, bitcoin is one news catalyst away from that awaited upside thrust, and these potentially fresh short positions at $107,000 could provide the ammunition to that eventual break out.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/19/bitcoin-s-volatile-liquidity-run-could-lead-to-new-record-highs,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin|btc|Liquidity|market analysis|News",cryptocompare

2025-05-19T11:57:19.000Z,"Big News For XRP: This Company Just Applied for 3 XRP ETFs","Prominent crypto commentator Levi (@LeviRietveld) recently drew attention to a new filing relating to XRP, highlighting a registration by Volatility Shares Trust for XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) products. Levi shared his excitement on X, as he and the broader XRP community anticipate the launch of spot XRP ETFs. However, while Levi misidentified the ETF products, a recent Coindesk report shared more information, revealing that Volatility Shares has filed for a spot XRP ETF, a 2x leveraged XRP ETF, and a -1x inverse XRP ETF. More XRP ETF Applications Join the Race The registration indicates Volatility Shares’ intent to offer multiple forms of exposure to XRP, including direct tracking, enhanced upside, and short positioning. The spot ETF would directly follow the price of XRP, the 2x leveraged product aims to deliver twice the daily performance of XRP, and the inverse ETF would provide the opposite of XRP’s daily returns. These filings are part of a broader push by Volatility Shares to introduce cryptocurrency-based ETFs to the market. The company was previously the first to launch a 2x Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. and is now extending its lineup to include XRP. Teucrium, a known ETF issuer, recently gained approval for its 2x XRP ETF in the U.S. and has since disclosed that the product achieved the most successful ETF launch in the company’s history. This shows the significant demand and trading volume potential for XRP-related products. Volatility Shares’ products are intended to be listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, according to regulatory documents filed under Form 8-A12B on May 16, 2025. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Mounting Pressure for Regulatory Approval Volatility Shares is among several firms seeking approval to offer XRP ETFs in the United States. Other applicants include Grayscale, Bitwise, WisdomTree, 21Shares, CoinShares, Canary Capital, and more than 70 other ETF applications are pending . While the U.S. market is waiting for the SEC, crypto markets worldwide are progressing. Brazil’s securities regulator has approved the world’s first spot XRP ETF . This development is mounting more pressure on U.S. regulators to authorize similar products domestically. What’s Next for XRP ETFs The market conditions surrounding XRP ETFs have evolved notably in 2025. The combination of international approvals and successful domestic launches provides a favorable backdrop for further expansion. Regulatory clarity around XRP has also improved following the settlement agreement between Ripple and the SEC. While both parties have faced a recent setback, experts believe the official resolution of the lawsuit will come soon , cementing XRP’s legal clarity and opening the door for institutional investment through ETFs and other products.

According to CoinGecko , the global cryptocurrency market cap has dropped by 3.7% to $3.37 trillion at press time. This surprising divergence comes amid a sharp rejection in Bitcoin’s price, which fell from a new multi-month high above $107,000 to around $103,000 within hours. Altcoins followed suit, with Ethereum losing over 4% in a single day, currently hovering around $2,400. Why is the price of Virtuals Protocol’s VIRTUAL rising? The price of Virtuals Protocol’s native token, VIRTUAL, has been displaying volatility but remains among the market’s strongest performers over the past month. At the time of writing, VIRTUAL traded at $1.81, having experienced a modest gain of 2% in the past 24 hours, while posting an impressive 13.7% gain over the past week and over 212% in the last 30 days. One key factor contributing to VIRTUAL’s resilience is strong investor engagement, driven by consistent platform growth and ecosystem developments. Notably, the integration of Arbus, a new AI-powered market intelligence layer, appears to have sparked interest.

However, technical analysis suggests caution. A potential triple top pattern is forming, indicating bearish momentum may be building. Virtuals Protocol price chart | Source: TradingView After repeated failed breakouts above the $2.08 resistance level, VIRTUAL could soon retest its neckline around $1.66. If support fails, the next potential downside target lies near $1.23. Despite these risks, strong historical price performance and consistent trading activity support the token’s current standing among top altcoin movers. Why is the price of KAITO rising? KAITO, the native token of the Kaito AI ecosystem, is gaining significant traction amid a broader market sell-off. Trading at $1.90 with an 8.6% daily increase, KAITO has shown sustained momentum in recent weeks. It has climbed from a monthly low of $0.6747 in mid-April to a recent peak of $2.11, before settling into its current range. While it remains 34% below the February 2025 all-time high (ATH) of $2.92 according to CoinMarketCap, KAITO’s current bullish momentum points to a possible surge above the ATH soon. One of the primary drivers of KAITO’s surge is the platform’s growing influence within the Web3 social and AI-powered content economy. Kaito’s innovative approach, which combines AI content generation with decentralised incentives, has attracted a large user base. The Kaito Yapper leaderboard, which rewards users for quality engagement and content sharing, is fueling demand. This week alone, over $5,000 in USDS is being distributed to the top 20 participants, with additional incentives for regional contributors. Additionally, the platform is now integrated with high-profile campaigns such as Novastro’s token rewards and OpenLedger’s content initiatives. These collaborative efforts are creating a strong flywheel effect for user acquisition, while the KAITO token remains central to reward distribution. Furthermore, users are publicly reporting large earnings from Kaito-related campaigns and airdrops, adding to the hype and drawing in new speculators. Kaito’s strong community engagement, coupled with its airdrop success stories, is helping maintain its upward trajectory even as most of the crypto market struggles to recover. Other altcoins to watch as Ethereum and Bitcoin bleed While the broader crypto landscape faces downward pressure, a few other altcoins are also managing to defy the trend and post strong gains. Among them is Collaterize (COLLAT), which has soared by over 73% in the past 24 hours, trading around $0.0504. Its market cap now exceeds $50 million, and its 7-day performance is up more than 130%, making it the top gainer of the day. Another strong performer is Keeta (KTA), which has risen nearly 25%, followed by Acet (ACT) and SX Network (SX), both registering double-digit gains. These assets are drawing liquidity in a market that appears to be favouring highly speculative, low-cap projects during this correction phase. Interestingly, the rise of these altcoins coincides with increased Bitcoin dominance, which has climbed back above 61%. This suggests that while larger-cap altcoins like Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are under pressure, traders are rotating into smaller-cap assets that offer quicker potential returns. The current market dynamic reveals a split strategy among investors, cautious on majors but aggressively opportunistic with emerging altcoins. This bifurcation could persist, especially if Bitcoin remains range-bound and fails to reclaim new highs.

2025-05-19T11:49:01.000Z,"Australian court ruling could lead to $640M in Bitcoin tax refunds","A court decision in Australia could open the door to as much as $640 million in capital gains tax (CGT) refunds on Bitcoin transactions after a judge ruled that crypto should be treated as money rather than a taxable asset. On May 19, the Australian Financial Review (AFR) reported that the decision arose within a criminal case involving federal police officer William Wheatley, who allegedly stole 81.6 Bitcoin ( BTC ) in 2019. At the time, the assets were worth roughly $492,000. At current market prices, the tokens are valued at more than $13 million. In the case, Judge Michael O’Connell of Victoria ruled that Bitcoin qualifies as a form of money rather than property, likening the digital asset to Australian dollars rather than to shares, gold or foreign currency. The interpretation could set a legal precedent, potentially placing Bitcoin transactions outside the scope of Australia’s current CGT regime. New court ruling challenges Australian crypto tax laws In an AFR interview, tax lawyer Adrian Cartland said the verdict “totally upends” the Australian Taxation Office’s (ATO) current position. Since 2014, the ATO has classified crypto assets as CGT assets. This means that users must pay tax when selling or trading them. Under the ATO’s guidance, any disposal of Bitcoin, including selling it for fiat, exchanging it for another crypto or using it to purchase goods or services, constitutes a CGT event. This framework has been the basis for taxing cryptocurrency transactions in Australia for over a decade. However, the recent ruling challenges the approach by suggesting that Bitcoin functions more like money than property. This potentially exempts it from CGT. Related: Australian feds seize mansion, Bitcoin allegedly linked to crypto exchange hack Tax refunds could reach $640 million Cartland said it was held that Bitcoin is Australian money. “That is, it is not a CGT asset. Therefore, acquisitions and disposals of Bitcoin have no tax consequences,” the tax lawyer added. If the ruling is upheld on the appeal, Cartland estimates that there could be potential tax refunds totalling 1 billion Australian dollars ($640 million). However, while Cartland thinks there could be up to a billion in refunds, the ATO said there were no official figures that confirm the amount to be potentially refunded if the case changes how Bitcoin is taxed in Australia.

2025-05-19T11:45:31.000Z,"Trump Administration To Slash Banking Rules Designed To Prevent 2008-Style Collapse: Report","The US government is reportedly gearing up to announce a rollback in banking regulations that will provide financial institutions with looser capital requirements. President Trump’s administration is preparing to announce a reduction in the supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) for US banks’ capital reserves, the Financial Times (FT) reports , citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. Regulators originally implemented the current SLR rules as part of Basel III in 2014, aiming to prevent a repeat of the 2008-2009 Global Financial Crisis. But some have argued that the regulations hold back the market and the financial industry. Says Greg Baer, head of the Bank Policy Institute lobby group, “Penalizing banks for holding low-risk assets like Treasuries undermines their ability to support market liquidity during times of stress when it is most needed… Regulators should act now rather than waiting for the next event.” Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell also said earlier this year that he believed dialing back the SLR would “strongly” help support the US Treasury market. “We need to work on Treasury market structure, and part of that answer can be, and I think will be, reducing the calibration of the supplemental leverage ratio.” But others don’t share the same sentiment. Nicolas Véron, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, tells the FT that given the current risks for US banks and the role of the dollar and the direction of the economy, now is not the right time to relax capital standards. Under Basel III, systemically important banks (SIBs) in the United States are required to maintain a supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of 5% or more at the holding company level and 6% at the insured depository institution level. Meanwhile, many other developed countries adhere to the Basel III minimum SLR of 3%, though some jurisdictions have proposed or implemented slightly higher standards ranging from 3.5% to 4.25% FT’s sources did not specify what precise SLR percentage regulators are aiming for, but lobbyists say they would like to bring America’s requirements more in line with international standards.

2025-05-19T11:31:41.000Z,"Australian federal police seizes $4.5M in assets tied to 2013 crypto theft","Australian authorities have seized more than $4.5 million in assets from a Queensland man, who was linked to the 2013 theft of 950 BTC from a French crypto exchange. In a May 18 statement , AFP-led Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce said that more than $4.5 million worth of assets—including a waterfront mansion in Queensland, a luxury vehicle, and nearly 25 Bitcoin ( BTC )—have been forfeited to the Commonwealth, following an investigation into the suspected proceeds of a major international crypto theft dating back to 2013. The forfeiture was ordered by the District Court of Queensland back in April this year, culminating a years-long probe into stolen digital assets and cybercrime involving a Queensland man previously convicted of hacking a U.S.-based gaming company. The man, whose identity has not been publicly disclosed in this announcement, was also linked to the theft of 950 BTC from a French crypto exchange in 2013. While no criminal charges were filed in this specific case, Australian authorities used the Proceeds of Crime Act to pursue the assets under civil forfeiture laws, which do not require a criminal conviction. The investigation, known as Operation Gouldian, began in September 2018 after AUSTRAC—the Australian financial intelligence agency—received information from law enforcement in Luxembourg about suspicious BTC transactions. This triggered a deeper probe into the individual’s financial activity, which ultimately revealed a massive gap between the man’s apparent wealth and any identifiable legitimate income. By July 2023, the CACT had secured restraining orders over several assets believed to be funded through criminal means, including a 2019 black Mercedes Benz sedan, a waterfront property in Beachmere, and 24.99454224 BTC. Federal agents later executed search warrants at the Beachmere property, strengthening the case for forfeiture. You might also like: 12 more charged in $263M crypto theft and RICO conspiracy “Criminals are driven by greed at the expense of honest Australians and businesses who are losing their hard-earned money to cyber criminals,” AFP Commander Jason Kennedy said in a statement. “The profits derived from criminal activities are also often used to fund further criminal acts, which is why the AFP works closely with our partners in the CACT to target the proceeds of crime and ensure they are re-invested in the community.” The seized assets will be liquidated by the Australian Financial Security Authority, and the funds will be transferred to the Commonwealth Confiscated Assets Account. From there, they may be allocated by the Attorney-General to support crime prevention initiatives, law enforcement programs, and efforts targeting the illicit drug trade and related social harms. The Queensland forfeiture adds to a growing list of recent cases where proceeds from crypto thefts were used to fund lavish lifestyles. For example, last week, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted 12 more individuals in a $263 million crypto fraud case, revealing that the illicit gains were spent on luxury vehicles, jewelry, and designer goods.

Once seen as a rocket fueled by internet hype and retail dreams, Bitcoin ( BTC ) may be settling into a slower, more mature phase as large investors step in, analyst Willy Woo says. In a recent post on X, Woo questioned the idea of Bitcoin’s limitless growth, saying “people think BTC is like a magical unicorn that climbs to infinity on moonbeams.” He pointed to a chart showing that the triple-digit annual gains seen in 2017 have since faded, suggesting those days may be behind us. People think BTC is like a magical unicorn that climbs to infinity on moonbeams. Here's the actual CAGR chart. We are well past the 2017 year where we'd see many 100s of percent growth. Now look at 2020, that was the year BTC got institutionalised, corporations and sovereigns… pic.twitter.com/hcGAGZXkU5 — Willy Woo (@woonomic) May 18, 2025 Woo pointed to 2020 as a key turning point for Bitcoin, saying it marked the start of institutional adoption as “corporations and sovereigns started accumulating.” He noted that Bitcoin’s compound annual growth rate dropped from over 100% to around 30-40% after that, and added that the figure has been trending downward as more capital flows into the network. Data from Bitcoin Treasuries shows that private and public companies, ETFs, and governments collectively hold nearly 3 million BTC as of May. After accounting for an estimated 3.5 million lost coins, this represents about 18.75% of Bitcoin’s effective circulating supply.

Despite the slowing growth, Woo remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term prospects, encouraging investors to “enjoy the ride” for the next 15 to 20 years, noting that few publicly investable assets can match Bitcoin’s performance over the long term, even as its compound annual growth rate gradually declines.

2025-05-19T11:30:00.000Z,"Bitcoin Fees Hit 2025 High as Corporate Buys Draw Scrutiny","Bitcoin’s growing presence on corporate balance sheets is prompting mixed reactions across markets. As transaction fees on the Bitcoin network hit their highest levels of 2025, Singapore-based Basel Medical Group announced plans to purchase $1 billion worth of the cryptocurrency through a share-swap arrangement. The move, intended to strengthen its financial position and support future acquisitions, was met with skepticism from investors, sending the company’s stock down 15%. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s rising fees reflect renewed demand for its blockspace, even as daily transaction volume declines. Bitcoin Transaction Fees Rise as Price Pushes Toward $106K, Despite Slowing Activity Bitcoin (BTC) continues to capture market attention in May 2025, as its price briefly touched a new local high of nearly $106,000 before retreating slightly to around $104,500. While traders welcomed the surge, they also took note of a corresponding rise in transaction fees, which is a signal that demand for Bitcoin's blockspace is once again heating up. According to recent data, the seven-day moving average of transaction fees on the Bitcoin network has climbed steadily since early May, reaching a 2025 high of $2.40. That marks a roughly $1 increase over just a couple of weeks. The growing fees are often seen as an indicator of increased network congestion and heightened competition for block inclusion, especially as Bitcoin’s price surges. Curiously, the fee increase isn’t being driven by a higher transaction count. In fact, the average number of daily transactions has been falling. Data shows that Bitcoin handled around 507,000 transactions on April 22, a figure that has since dropped more than 35% to approximately 330,000 daily transactions. This inverse correlation—higher fees despite fewer transactions—suggests that the transactions being processed may be larger, more complex, or more urgent, driving users to pay higher fees to ensure prompt confirmations. It also points to renewed activity from institutions or major holders willing to pay a premium to move funds during price rallies. Bitcoin Dominance Reclaims Ground Bitcoin's market dominance, the metric that compares BTC’s market cap to that of the entire crypto ecosystem, has rebounded in recent days following a slight pullback earlier in the month. This recovery suggests that the dip in Bitcoin’s value relative to altcoins was more likely a result of temporary liquidity imbalances than a fundamental pivot toward an ”altcoin season.” Bitcoin dominance chart (Source: CoinMarketCap ) The latest bounceback in dominance signals that investors are still leaning heavily into Bitcoin during periods of volatility, affirming its status as the market’s most stable digital asset and primary store of value. One of the more bullish signals for Bitcoin comes from Glassnode’s data on illiquid supply. The amount of BTC held in wallets with little to no spending history has hit an all-time high, reducing the liquid supply available on exchanges. This tightening supply dynamic is key. With less Bitcoin available for immediate trade and rising demand spurred by both institutional interest and macroeconomic uncertainty, any continued inflows could rapidly tip the scales toward a supply shock. That scenario could drive prices even higher as buyers compete for a shrinking pool of tradable BTC. This trend reinforces a recurring theme in Bitcoin market cycles: HODLing behavior intensifies in anticipation of further gains, leaving less room for new buyers unless they’re willing to pay a premium. What’s Behind the Rally? Several factors appear to be fueling Bitcoin’s current rally. Renewed institutional interest, continued inflationary pressures in traditional economies, and growing concerns over global debt levels have made hard-capped digital assets more attractive. Additionally, geopolitical tensions and recent US Treasury discussions about expanding digital dollar research may be helping BTC find support as a decentralized alternative to state-issued currencies. And while the altcoin market has seen periodic excitement, Bitcoin remains the benchmark asset for those looking to hedge against macroeconomic instability. With transaction fees on the rise and network congestion mounting, the Bitcoin ecosystem may soon be tested again. Developers are watching closely for signals of renewed spam activity. particularly from inscriptions and Ordinals, that could artificially inflate network use. At the same time, increased fee revenues are welcomed by miners, especially following the recent halving which slashed block rewards. For now, the combination of surging illiquid supply, rising fees, and rebounding dominance presents a compelling setup for Bitcoin bulls. If liquidity continues flowing in and retail investors return in force, the case for a sustained push beyond $106,000 becomes more plausible. Yet caution is warranted. The divergence between price and transaction volume introduces potential volatility, especially if speculative activity returns to the market without fundamental support. As always in crypto, sentiment can shift quickly. Basel Medical Group Shares Fall 15% After Announcing $1B Bitcoin Treasury Purchase In other Bitcoin news, Basel Medical Group has become the latest public company to bet big on BTC, announcing plans to acquire $1 billion worth of the cryptocurrency for its corporate treasury. But the news has triggered a sharp sell-off, with shares of the Singapore-based healthcare provider plunging nearly 15% in intraday trading on May 16, according to Google Finance data. Basel Medical’s shares down 15% on May 16 (Source: Google Finance ) The market’s reaction suggests that while Bitcoin may be gaining traction as a treasury asset among corporations, shareholder skepticism remains high, particularly when the pivot comes from firms outside the tech or financial sectors. In a statement issued on May 16, Basel Medical said it is in “advanced discussions with a consortium of institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals” to acquire $1 billion in Bitcoin through a “novel share-swap arrangement.” The deal, the company claims, will significantly strengthen its balance sheet and enhance its ability to pursue mergers and acquisitions across Asia’s rapidly expanding healthcare sector. The Bitcoin allocation, Basel says, is designed to “establish a diversified asset base to weather market volatility” and provide “unmatched financial flexibility” amid ongoing expansion plans. Yet shareholders were far from reassured. Following the announcement, shares of Basel Medical Group (ticker: BMGL) fell precipitously, erasing over $150 million in market capitalization by midday. The sell-off mirrors other recent episodes where investors responded negatively to similar Bitcoin treasury announcements, casting doubt on whether corporate BTC strategies can win broad investor approval. Strategic Play or Risky Gamble? Basel Medical’s bold move is part of a broader strategy to fuel inorganic growth. Just last month, the firm acquired Bethesda Medical, a regional peer, in a move touted as “the beginning of Basel Medical Group’s expansion strategy in Singapore and the broader Southeast Asian healthcare market.” CEO Darren Chhoa defended the Bitcoin treasury pivot, calling it a cornerstone of the company’s M&A roadmap. “Our expanded balance sheet will allow us to move quickly on strategic opportunities as we build a premier healthcare platform across high-growth Asian markets,” Chhoa said. Still, market observers remain divided on the wisdom of merging Bitcoin speculation with healthcare operations. While some hail the move as visionary, others question whether volatile crypto assets belong on the books of a traditionally conservative industry like healthcare. Basel isn’t the first company to see its stock punished after announcing plans to buy Bitcoin. In March, GameStop lost almost $3 billion in market value in a single day after revealing its own plans to adopt a Bitcoin treasury model. Investors reacted with confusion, wondering whether the struggling video game retailer was losing strategic focus. “There are question marks with GameStop's model,” eToro US investment analyst Bret Kenwell told Reuters at the time. “If bitcoin is going to be the pivot, where does that leave everything else?” Despite the pushback, Bitcoin treasuries continue to grow. According to BitcoinTreasuries.net, corporations now hold approximately $80 billion worth of BTC on their balance sheets. Early adopters like Strategy and Tesla have helped blaze the trail, with Strategy in particular using convertible debt and equity offerings to accumulate over $13 billion in Bitcoin. Bitcoin treasury metrics (Source: Bitcointreasuries.net ) Financial institutions are also becoming more open to the idea. In a 2024 report, Fidelity Digital Assets noted that Bitcoin could serve as a “valuable hedge against growing fiscal deficits, currency debasement, and geopolitical risks”—a view increasingly shared by macro investors amid uncertain global conditions. A Crypto Hedge for Healthcare? For Basel Medical, the rationale appears rooted in a desire to gain financial leverage without taking on traditional debt. The share-swap model being discussed could allow the company to issue new shares in exchange for Bitcoin from private investors, thereby acquiring the asset without immediate cash outflows. In theory, this would provide Basel with an appreciating reserve asset that could be liquidated or borrowed against in future acquisitions. But such a strategy depends heavily on Bitcoin’s continued upward trajectory, an assumption not all shareholders are willing to bet on. Moreover, critics argue that using shareholder capital to accumulate crypto risks undermining investor confidence in the firm’s core business. For a company operating in healthcare, where predictability and risk management are paramount, adding a volatile digital asset to the treasury could be perceived as reckless. The Basel news comes at a time when Bitcoin itself is on the rise, recently trading just above $104,000. As macroeconomic uncertainties mount and fiat currencies face growing scrutiny, more companies may consider Bitcoin exposure as a strategic asset. But as this week’s sell-off shows, the market is still drawing a line between financial innovation and speculative overreach.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9168/bitcoin-fees-hit-2025-high-as-corporate-buys-draw-scrutiny,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-05-19T11:27:09.000Z,"Arthur Hayes Gives Clear Date for Altcoin Season: \""But Bitcoin Must Rise to This Level First!\"" – Announced the Altcoin That Will Rise the Most!","Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes, known for his bold predictions about Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins, made new statements. Announcing the prediction for the highly anticipated altcoin season, Arthur Hayes said that the altcoin season is expected to occur this summer or early in the third quarter. When Will Altcoin Season Begin? Speaking to Fortuna, Hayes explained his predictions about Bitcoin and altcoins, as well as curiosities about his portfolio. Hayes stated that he also invested in gold apart from cryptocurrencies at this point and said that gold constitutes approximately 20% of his personal investment portfolio. He argued that for the expected altcoin season, Bitcoin must first surpass $110,000 and climb to between $150,000 and $200,000 with increasing trading volume. He said he expects this growth in BTC to likely occur this summer or early in the third quarter. According to Hayes, when Bitcoin reaches these levels, the altcoin season will also begin. However, Hayes stated that this altcoin season will not be like the 2021 super cycle, where each altcoin increased 100 times, and warned investors against some altcoins. According to Hayes, older altcoins with high fully diluted valuations (FDV), low circulating supply, low user base, and low revenue are unlikely to perform well in this cycle. Ethereum Will Surpass Solana! Hayes also said that ETH has stronger upside potential than Solana, citing Ethereum’s high total value locked (TVL), robust developer ecosystem, and position as the most secure proof-of-stake blockchain. Hayes, who acknowledged that Solana has seen a tremendous rise from $7 to $170, said that despite this rise, he expects ETH to perform better in the upcoming bull market. Bitcoin Price Prediction! Finally, Hayes, who also announced his Bitcoin price prediction, estimates that Bitcoin will reach $1 million before Trump's term ends and approximately $250,000 by the end of 2025. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-19T11:49:01.000Z,"Australian court ruling could lead to $640M in Bitcoin tax refunds","A court decision in Australia could open the door to as much as $640 million in capital gains tax (CGT) refunds on Bitcoin transactions after a judge ruled that crypto should be treated as money rather than a taxable asset. On May 19, the Australian Financial Review (AFR) reported that the decision arose within a criminal case involving federal police officer William Wheatley, who allegedly stole 81.6 Bitcoin (BTC) in 2019. At the time, the assets were worth roughly $492,000. At current market prices, the tokens are valued at more than $13 million.In the case, Judge Michael O’Connell of Victoria ruled that Bitcoin qualifies as a form of money rather than property, likening the digital asset to Australian dollars rather than to shares, gold or foreign currency.The interpretation could set a legal precedent, potentially placing Bitcoin transactions outside the scope of Australia’s current CGT regime.  New court ruling challenges Australian crypto tax lawsIn an AFR interview, tax lawyer Adrian Cartland said the verdict “totally upends” the Australian Taxation Office’s (ATO) current position. Since 2014, the ATO has classified crypto assets as CGT assets. This means that users must pay tax when selling or trading them. Under the ATO’s guidance, any disposal of Bitcoin, including selling it for fiat, exchanging it for another crypto or using it to purchase goods or services, constitutes a CGT event. This framework has been the basis for taxing cryptocurrency transactions in Australia for over a decade. However, the recent ruling challenges the approach by suggesting that Bitcoin functions more like money than property. This potentially exempts it from CGT.Related: Australian feds seize mansion, Bitcoin allegedly linked to crypto exchange hackTax refunds could reach $640 millionCartland said it was held that Bitcoin is Australian money. “That is, it is not a CGT asset. Therefore, acquisitions and disposals of Bitcoin have no tax consequences,” the tax lawyer added. If the ruling is upheld on the appeal, Cartland estimates that there could be potential tax refunds totalling 1 billion Australian dollars ($640 million). However, while Cartland thinks there could be up to a billion in refunds, the ATO said there were no official figures that confirm the amount to be potentially refunded if the case changes how Bitcoin is taxed in Australia. Magazine: Binance Wallet ‘killing’ MetaMask and airdrops, Chinese RWA tokens: Asia Express",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/australia-bitcoin-tax-ruling-cgt-refunds?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-19T09:59:39.000Z,"Dubai regulator sets compliance deadline for updated crypto rules","Dubai’s crypto regulator has given licensed digital asset companies until June 19 to comply with its updated activity-based Rulebooks to enhance market integrity and risk oversight. On May 19, Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) announced that it had released Version 2.0 of the Rulebooks. The regulator said it had strengthened controls around margin trading and token distribution services, harmonised compliance requirements across all licensed activities and given clearer definitions for collateral wallet arrangements. VARA’s team will engage with licensed entities and expects the companies to comply with the updated rules after a 30-day transition period.“In line with global regulatory best practices, a 30-day transition period has been granted to all impacted virtual asset service providers [VASPs], with full compliance required by 19 June 2025,” VARA wrote.  VARA enhances supervisory mechanismsVARA highlighted that it had enhanced supervisory mechanisms across several regulated activities. This includes advisory, broker-dealer, custody, exchange, lending and borrowing, virtual asset (VA) management and investment, and VA transfer and settlement services. A VARA spokesperson told Cointelegraph that the updates will bring consistency across all activity-based rules defining core operational terms. The spokesperson gave examples of terms like “client assets,” “qualified custodians,” and “collateral requirements” as some of the terms more consistently defined in the update.  The update also aligned risk management and disclosure obligations, where activities overlap, in areas like brokerage, custody and exchange. “The aim was to reduce ambiguity and help VASPs navigate cross-functional compliance more easily,” VARA told Cointelegraph. Related: Dubai gov’t agencies to link real estate registry with property tokenizationDubai regulator tightens leverage thresholds for margin tradingAs for margin trading, the VARA spokesperson said they tightened leverage thresholds, mandated clearer collateralisation standards, and enhanced the monitoring obligations for VASPs offering this feature. Margin trading allows traders to control large positions with smaller amounts of capital. It amplifies both gains and losses. Tightening the leverage traders use helps limit the risks of widespread liquidations in a market downturn. The crypto regulator introduced a new section on token distribution that sets out licensing prerequisites, investor protections and marketing restrictions. The spokesperson emphasized the marketing restrictions, especially for “retail-facing offers.” “It’s about aligning with global conduct expectations and closing observed regulatory gaps,” the VARA spokesperson said. Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/dubai-crypto-regulator-updates-rulebooks-tightens-margin-trading?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-19T08:55:00.000Z,"Crypto drainers as a service: What you need to know","What is a crypto drainer?              A crypto drainer is a malicious script designed to steal cryptocurrency from your wallet. Unlike regular phishing attacks that try to capture login credentials, a crypto drainer tricks you into connecting your wallets, such as MetaMask or Phantom, and unknowingly authorizing transactions that grant them access to your funds.Disguised as a legitimate Web3 project, a crypto drainer is usually promoted via compromised social media accounts or Discord groups. Once you fall prey to the fraud, the drainer can instantly transfer assets from the wallet.Crypto drainers may take various forms:Malicious smart contracts that initiate unauthorized transfers.Fake NFTs or token systems that create deceptive exchanges or assets.Crypto drainers are a growing threat in Web3, enabling quick, automated theft of crypto assets from unsuspecting users through deception. Common methods of crypto drainers include: Phishing websites.Fake airdrops.Deceptive ads.Malicious smart contracts.Harmful browser extensions.Fake NFT marketplaces.                  Crypto drainers-as-a-service (DaaS), explained              DaaS elevates the threat of crypto drainers by commercializing them. Just like  software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms, DaaS platforms sell ready-to-use malware kits to cybercriminals, often in exchange for a percentage of the stolen funds.In the DaaS model, developers offer turnkey draining scripts, customizable phishing kits and even integration help in exchange for a share of the stolen funds. A DaaS offer might be bundled with social engineering support, anonymization services and regular updates, making them attractive even to low-skill scammers.Types of crypto DaaS tools include:JavaScript-based drainers: Malicious JavaScript is embedded into phishing websites that mimic legitimate decentralized apps (DApps). These scripts execute when you connect your wallet, silently triggering approval transactions that drain assets. Token approval malware: Tricks users into granting unlimited token access via malicious smart contracts.Clipboard hijackers: Hackers use clipboard hijackers to monitor and replace copied wallet addresses with those controlled by attackers. Info-stealers: They harvest browser data, wallet extensions and private keys. Some DaaS packages combine these with loader malware that drops additional payloads or updates the malicious code. Modular drainer kits: Segregated into modules, these drainers use obfuscation techniques to bypass browser-based security tools. Did you know? According to Scam Sniffer, phishing campaigns using wallet drainers siphoned off over $295 million in NFTs and tokens from unsuspecting users in 2023.                  What crypto DaaS kits include              Crypto DaaS kits are pre-built toolsets sold to scammers, enabling them to steal digital assets with minimal technical skill. These kits typically include phishing page templates, malicious smart contracts, wallet-draining scripts and more.This is what crypto DaaS kits generally include:Pre-built drainer software: Plug-and-play malware requiring minimal setup.Phishing kits: DaaS providers supply customizable phishing website templates that hackers can modify according to their plans.Social engineering: With DaaS, hackers find support for social engineering along with psychological tactics to trick users into connecting their wallets.Operational security (OPSEC) tools: To avoid detection, some DaaS vendors offer advanced operational security tools that mask user identity and hide digital footprints.Integration assistance and/obfuscation: These services help attackers deploy drainer scripts seamlessly and use obfuscation tools to evade tracking.Regular updates: Frequent improvements are designed to bypass wallet defenses and detection systems.User-friendly dashboards: Control panels that help attackers oversee operations and monitor drained funds.Documentation and tutorials: Step-by-step instructions enabling even beginners to execute scams efficiently.Customer support: Some DaaS operators provide real-time help through secure messaging apps like Telegram.With DaaS kits available for as little as $100 to $500, or through subscription models, sophisticated crypto attacks are no longer limited to experienced hackers. Even the inexperienced can now access these scripts with a small budget, effectively democratizing this type of crime.Did you know? Advanced DaaS tools often update scripts to evade detection from browser extensions like WalletGuard and security alerts issued by MetaMask or Trust Wallet.                  Evolution of crypto drainers as prominent fraudulent activity              The threat landscape of cryptocurrency fraud is constantly evolving. Emerging around 2021, crypto drainers have rapidly transformed the landscape. Their ability to stealthily siphon funds from users' wallets has made them a threat that demands vigilance.Drainers specifically designed to target MetaMask began to emerge around 2021 and were openly advertised on illicit online forums and marketplaces.Here are some prominent drainers that have been around for some time:Chick Drainer: It emerged in late 2023, targeting Solana (SOL) users through phishing campaigns. It operates using the CLINKSINK script, embedded in fake airdrop websites.Rainbow Drainer: The platform shares code similarities with Chick Drainer, suggesting potential reuse or collaboration among threat actors.Angel Drainer: Launched around August 2023, Angel Drainer is widely promoted on Telegram by threat groups like GhostSec. Affiliate scammers need to make an upfront payment between $5,000 and $10,000 and also pay a 20% commission on all stolen assets facilitated through its platform.Rugging’s Drainer: Compatible with several crypto platforms, this DaaS drainer offers comparatively low commission fees, typically ranging from 5% to 10% of the stolen proceeds. In the wake of the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s X account being compromised in January 2024, Chainalysis found a crypto drainer acting as the SEC. This led users to connect their wallets in an attempt to claim nonexistent airdropped tokens.According to a Kaspersky Security Bulletin, dark web threads discussing crypto drainers rose sharply in 2024, jumping by 135% to 129 threads from 55 in 2022. These conversations encompass a wide range of topics, including buying and selling malicious software and forming distribution teams.As the following chart demonstrates, crypto drainers have been stealing crypto at a faster quarterly growth rate than even ransomware.                  Red flags to identify a crypto DaaS attack              Spotting a crypto wallet drainer attack early is crucial to minimizing potential losses and securing your assets. You must be careful, as a sophisticated drainer attack can sometimes evade standard alert mechanisms. You must remain vigilant even while relying on automated tools. Here are a few indicators that your wallet may be under threat:Unusual transactions: A red flag of a drainer attack is finding transactions you didn’t authorize. These may include unexpected token transfers or withdrawals to unknown wallet addresses. Sometimes, attackers execute multiple small transfers to avoid detection, so you must monitor for repeated unusual transactions of low-value crypto. Lost access to wallet: If you cannot access your wallet or your funds are missing, it could mean an attacker has taken control. This often happens when the drainer changes private keys or recovery phrases, effectively locking you out. Security alerts from wallet providers: Your crypto wallet may issue security alerts for suspicious actions, like logins from new devices, failed access attempts or unauthorized transactions. These warnings indicate that someone may be trying to access your wallet or has already accessed it.Fake project websites or DApps: If you find a cloned or newly launched platform mimicking a real Web3 service and prompting wallet connections, it is a warning sign of a crypto drainer. It might also have urgent calls to action, urging users to immediately claim rewards, airdrops, or mint NFTs. The objective is to pressure victims into connecting wallets without verifying authenticity.Unverified social media promotions: Suspicious links shared via X, Discord, Telegram or Reddit, often unverified profiles, indicate a fraudulent attempt to drain money from a wallet. Fraudsters may also use compromised accounts to share malicious links. Unaudited smart contracts: Interacting with unfamiliar contracts without public audits or GitHub transparency can expose wallets to hidden drainer scripts.Wallet prompts requesting broad permissions: Sign-in or approval requests that ask for full token spending access or access to all assets, rather than specific transactions, are serious warning signs.Did you know? Just one popular drainer kit can be used by hundreds of affiliates. That means a single DaaS platform can be behind thousands of wallet thefts in a matter of days.                  How to protect your crypto wallet from DaaS attackers              To protect your crypto wallet from DaaS attackers, adopting strong, proactive security practices is essential. Blockchain monitoring tools can help identify suspicious patterns linked to drainer activity, allowing you to respond quickly. Here are key strategies to help protect your digital assets:Use hardware wallets: Hardware wallets, or cold wallets, store private keys offline, shielding them from online threats like malware and phishing. Keeping your keys in a physical device significantly lowers the risk of remote attacks and is ideal for securing long-term crypto holdings.Enable 2FA (two-factor authentication): Adding 2FA to your wallet means even if someone steals your password, they will need a second verification step. They need to put in a verification code sent to your phone to access the account, along with your password, making unauthorized access much harder.Avoid phishing links: Always verify URLs and avoid clicking on unsolicited messages claiming rewards or updates. Never input private keys or seed phrases on suspicious sites. When in doubt, manually enter the correct website address.Secure your private keys and seed phrases: Store your private keys and seed phrases offline in a safe, physical location. Never save these credentials on internet-connected devices, or hackers might get access to them, putting your wallet at risk. Verify apps and browser extensions: Take care to install software only from official sources. Research apps beforehand to avoid malicious or fake tools.Monitor wallet activity regularly: Check your wallet for unauthorized transactions or unusual patterns. Early detection can help stop further losses and improve recovery chances.                  What to do if you suffer from a crypto-drainer attack              Swift action is essential if you suspect your crypto wallet has been compromised. Though fund recovery is rare, quick action can limit further losses.Here are the steps you need to take if you suffer from a crypto DaaS attack:Secure your accounts: Immediately change the password for your wallet and enable 2FA, if you still have access to it. Transfer any remaining funds to a secure, uncompromised wallet.Notify your wallet provider or exchange: Report the incident to your wallet provider or exchange. You could request them to monitor your account or freeze suspicious activity. Platforms may flag suspicious addresses or prevent further transfers.File a report with authorities: Contact local law enforcement or cybercrime units, as cryptocurrency theft is treated as a financial crime in most regions.Seek professional assistance: Cybersecurity firms specializing in blockchain forensics can analyze transactions and potentially trace the stolen funds. While full recovery is unlikely, especially if assets pass through mixers or bridges, expert help may aid investigations.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/crypto-drainers-as-a-service-what-you-need-to-know?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The team claimed to have immediately responded and taken action involving multiple departments, including the firm’s chief operating officer, Helen Liu.Other people involved in the operation were the heads of customer service, risk control, the Chinese-language division, product managers and the technical team. The exchange coordinated its actions with the user.After an internal investigation, Bybit concluded this was a “unique case affecting an individual user, not a systemic issue.” The account’s KYC information was not tampered with and the funds in the account remained secure at all times.Bybit had not answered Cointelegraph’s request for comment at the time of writing.Related: A decade-old debate is back as self-custody gets smarterThe perks of media attentionBybit claims to have taken large-scale and timely action, which involved a member of its executive team, all in response to an issue reported by a single user.

They highlighted:“This incident really made me feel the value of having influence.”EnHeng said “in this market, retail investors often lack a voice and are vulnerable.” For this reason, he said, “When we have more resources and a bigger voice, we should use them to speak up for retail investors.”Related: Self-custody vs. centralized crypto cards: Freedom or convenience?Locked out of exchangeBeing locked out of a cryptocurrency exchange account or some of its features is not excessively uncommon. Often, it is an emergency measure meant to prevent fund losses.A recent example is Phemex crypto exchange halting withdrawals after being alerted to nearly $30 million worth of suspicious outflows that raised alarms among blockchain security firms in late January. Indian cryptocurrency exchange Mudrex temporarily halted crypto withdrawals during the same month, claiming compliance improvements were the reason.Sometimes action is taken on the request of law enforcement. Last summer, a small set of Palestinian user accounts was frozen after Israeli authorities issued a seizure request. Also last summer, OKX warned it would terminate any account linked to crypto mixer Tornado Cash or sanctioned addresses, and several users said their log-ins were suddenly disabled.Those incidents echo an old adage popular in the Bitcoin (BTC) community: Not your keys, not your coins.

2025-05-19T07:55:20.000Z,"Vitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes for Ethereum scaling","Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin unveiled a proposal to preserve trustless, censorship-resistant access to Ethereum, even as the network scales. On May 19, Buterin shared a post outlining how to make Ethereum's layer-1 scaling “more friendly” to users running local nodes for personal use. The Ethereum co-founder highlighted the importance of independent users running nodes, saying that a market dominated by a few Remote Procedure Call (RPC) providers risks censorship. RPC providers let wallets, users and apps interact with the blockchain without running their own nodes. Crypto wallets are usually connected to an RPC provider behind the scenes. Buterin believes there are risks to this setup. “A market structure dominated by a few RPC providers is one that will face strong pressure to deplatform or censor users. Many RPC providers already exclude entire countries,” Buterin wrote. Source: Vitalik ButerinVitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes In addition to censorship, Buterin argued that reasons like expensive fully-trustless cryptographic solutions and metadata privacy show that there’s value in ensuring greater ease for those running a personal node. In the proposal, Buterin's solution relies on a novel type of node called “partially stateless nodes.” These nodes are designed to help users maintain privacy-preserving access to blockchain data without the heavy resource demands of running a full node. As Ethereum scales and the gas limit increases, running a full node requires more storage and bandwidth. Buterin said partially stateless nodes address the issue by allowing users to verify the blockchain and serve local data, but only store a subset of the Ethereum state, based on the user’s needs.Vitalik Buterin’s graphic of partially stateless nodes. Source: Vitalik ButerinRelated: Ethereum Foundation unveils security initiative to supplant legacy systemsA new node type to validate blocks “statelessly”The nodes would operate by validating blocks statelessly. This means they don't require the storage of the full Merkle proofs or the entire blockchain history. They can selectively keep certain parts of the state up to date. This means that users could configure their nodes only to save data related to their accounts, the decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, and their commonly used tokens like stablecoins and Ether (ETH). The rest of the data will be left out, and queries beyond the stored subset will fail or be routed through an RPC solution. Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/vitalik-buterin-partially-stateless-nodes-ethereum-scaling-privacy?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-19T07:38:51.000Z,"How to read a Bitcoin liquidation map (without getting liquidated)","Understanding a Bitcoin liquidation map is imperative in dealing with the inherent volatility of the crypto market. The visual tool showcases probable liquidation levels, indicating where large orders may cause cascading price changes. This post explores how to interpret a Bitcoin liquidation map, allowing you to trade smarter in the volatile world of cryptocurrency.What is liquidation in crypto trading?In cryptocurrency trading, liquidation happens when an exchange forcefully closes a trader's leveraged position due to insufficient margin to pay losses. This usually occurs when the market moves sharply against the position. Long liquidations occur when prices fall, affecting traders who bet on an uptrend. Short liquidations happen when prices unexpectedly rise, impacting those who bet on a decline. Did you know? In crypto, a single liquidation cascade can wipe out millions in minutes, triggered not by hacking but by traders using too much leverage at the wrong time.What is a Bitcoin liquidation map?A Bitcoin liquidation map is a visual heatmap indicating price levels where large liquidations are expected to occur. These maps assist traders in identifying zones where leveraged positions may be closed forcibly if prices fluctuate sharply. Tools like CoinGlass provide real-time Bitcoin (BTC) liquidation maps, valuable resources for risk-aware traders. With the liquidation map, you canUse breakout trading strategies for profitable scalping opportunities.Set stop-loss levels based on key liquidation zones for better risk management.Target high-liquidity areas to secure profits efficiently.Enter large trades near liquidity clusters to minimize slippage and enhance execution.Analyze the gradient of liquidation intensity to anticipate potential price movements..Functioning of a liquidation map and key components The X-axis of the liquidation chart represents the bid price, while the Y-axis denotes the relative strength of liquidation activity. Each column on the graphic illustrates a liquidation cluster's relative significance compared to other clusters.The chart demonstrates how the market will respond if the price reaches certain thresholds. Taller liquidation bars indicate a higher potential impact. The various hues are solely for visual clarity, allowing users to distinguish between distinct liquidation zones.Here are the main components of a liquidation map:Heat zones: Indicate where most positions could be eliminated if the price reaches specific levels.Liquidity pools: Collections of stop-loss and liquidation orders that can cause rapid price movements.Open interest levels: Demonstrate where large amounts of leveraged positions are concentrated.Price imbalances or gaps: Disclose areas without support or resistance, allowing prices to move swiftly.Did you know? Crypto liquidations often follow the herd; when too many traders place similar bets, liquidation maps light up and whales use them as price targets.How to use a liquidation map in your Bitcoin trading strategyA Bitcoin liquidation map provides insights into probable price movements and risk zones by visually representing places where leveraged positions will likely be closed. Here is how to use a liquidation map in Bitcoin trading:Identify high-risk zones: Identify places with dense liquidation clusters to avoid overleveraging. These areas come across as magnets, attracting price changes that might cause a series of liquidations.Time entry and exit: Liquidation clusters help find the optimal entry and exit points. Entering and exiting trades before a cluster becomes risky helps you lock in profits before reversals.Combine with technical indicators: Enhance your research by combining liquidation maps with tools such as support/resistance levels and relative strength index (RSI). This sets out a comprehensive view of market conditions.Avoid herd mentality: Exercise caution in places with high leverage concentrations. Such zones may be traps constructed by larger players to induce liquidations and profit from the resulting volatility.Monitor whale activity: Large traders frequently target liquidation zones to turn price moves to their advantage. Observing these patterns can provide insights about prospective market movements.Anticipate reversals: Markets frequently experience reversals following large liquidation events. Recognizing these trends can aid in positioning for possible rebounds.Implement robust risk management: Use stop-loss orders and handle leverage carefully. Liquidation maps can help you determine where to put these orders to minimize exposure.Common mistakes to avoid when using the Bitcoin liquidation mapUsing a Bitcoin liquidation map can enhance trading decisions, but misinterpretation can lead to costly errors. Here are common mistakes you need to avoid:Blindly trading toward liquidity zones: If you are trading toward liquidity zones without thinking, expect reversals.Misreading map colors or scale: Making a mistake in judging map colors or scale can skew your risk assessment.Over-relying on liquidation data without context: Maps are valuable tools, not an assurance that what they reflect will happen.Ignoring macro news or sentiment analysis: External events often override technical signals. A sudden event may make all predictions fall flat.Always combine liquidation maps with broader technical analysis. Smart trading requires context, not just colorful charts.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Source: PACERCoinbase reported on May 15 that four days earlier it had been hit with a $20 million extortion attempt after cybercriminals bribed several of its customer support agents to access internal systems and steal a limited amount of user account data.The stolen data included names, addresses, phone numbers, emails, the last four digits of Social Security numbers, some bank account identifiers, driver’s licenses, passports and some account data, such as balance snapshots and transaction history.Bender claimed that “Coinbase failed to implement and maintain reasonable security safeguards,” which exposed users to “serious and ongoing risks.”The suit also claimed Coinbase’s response to the incident was “inadequate, fragmented, and delayed.”“Users were not promptly or fully informed of the compromise, and Coinbase did not immediately take meaningful steps to mitigate further harm,  provide identity protection services, or offer actionable guidance to affected individuals,” the complaint claimed.The lawsuit claimed users could face “substantial, immediate, and ongoing threat of identity theft and financial fraud” and that the consequences of the breach could be long-term or “potentially permanent” because the compromised information can’t be recovered or made secure once exposed.Flurry of lawsuits make similar allegations Two other lawsuits filed in a New York federal court made similar claims against Coinbase, while a fourth lawsuit added the allegation of unjust enrichment, arguing that Coinbase didn’t spend enough on data security measures.All four complaints ask for damages and other measures to help protect the plaintiff’s sensitive data.Meanwhile, a fifth lawsuit filed in a California federal court on May 15 made similar claims against Coinbase, but asked the court to order Coinbase to purge all sensitive data it holds about the plaintiffs and hire third-party security auditors to test its security systems, among other requests.A Coinbase spokesperson did not comment on the lawsuits and instead pointed Cointelegraph to a blog post it shared regarding the data breaches.Coinbase said it refused to pay the $20 million ransom and has flagged plans to reimburse users tricked into sending crypto to phishing scammers due to the data breach.In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the exchange said it expects reimbursement expenses ranging from $180 million to $400 million.Related: Retired artist loses $2M in crypto to Coinbase impersonatorThe exchange also reportedly fired a group of customer support agents based in India following their alleged involvement in social engineering attacks on users.Coinbase (COIN) shares dipped 7% and dropped to $244 after it disclosed the data breach along with an ongoing SEC probe over misstated user numbers in 2021.The stock has since staged a comeback, spiking 9% and hitting $266 by the closing bell on May 16, according to Google Finance. Coinbase has climbed even higher following the data breach.

Bitcoin developer John Carvalho introduced Bitcoin Improvement Proposal-177 on April 23, which seeks to eliminate the concept of satoshis, of which there are 100,000,000 in 1 Bitcoin (BTC), and effectively split Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million into 21 quadrillion units.It follows a 2017 proposal from Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song to create “bits,” representing one-millionth of 1 Bitcoin. However, Carvalho said Song’s approach would still require Bitcoin users to think about decimals and “shifts complexity rather than eliminating it.”Block Inc. CEO Jack Dorsey is among those calling for the change, saying in a May 18 X post that satoshis, or sats, are too confusing for newcomers.“Bits of Bitcoin is better, and just Bitcoin is best,” Dorsey said.Dorsey pointed to a December 2024 discussion on the topic where Stevie Lee, product lead of Bitcoin infrastructure firm Spiral, argued that not enough people know or care about what satoshis are.“Everyone knows Bitcoin, no one knows sats, people just want to send and receive Bitcoin,” Lee said, recalling past conversations where people thought satoshis were an entirely new token, unrelated to Bitcoin.He added that the Bitcoin community shouldn’t be too concerned with the change, as they know the underlying economics of Bitcoin would remain intact.Related: DOJ charges 12 more gamer-turned $263M Bitcoin robbersSwan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten and Byte Federal director of product Michelle Weekley were among those who opposed the change.“People understand cents in a dollar, they will understand sats in a Bitcoin,” Weekley said on X.Magdalena Gronowska, a self-described Bitcoin consultant, claimed that the change could make some people think that Bitcoin abruptly crashed from its current price of around $100,000 and that its “supply has massively inflated.”Zaprite business development lead Parker Lewis argued that sats were easier to understand.

Traders lift their end-of-year Bitcoin price targets to $200,000 based on technical factors and institutional investor adoption. Bitcoin (BTC) has been stuck in a narrow range for the past few days, but the rally above $105,500 on May 18 increases the possibility of an upside breakout. Popular trader Alan said in a post on X that Bitcoin could soar to $116,000 early next week.Another bullish voice was that of Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan. While speaking to Cointelegraph, Hougan said that a supply shock due to increased institutional demand could propel Bitcoin to $200,000 by the end of 2025. He expects seller exhaustion to occur at the $100,000 level.Crypto market data daily view.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewBoth moving averages are sloping up, and the relative strength index (RSI) is in the overbought zone, signaling that the buyers hold the edge. A break and close above $105,820 increases the likelihood of a retest of the $109,588 level. Sellers will try to defend the $109,588 resistance, but if the bulls prevail, the BTC/USDT pair could skyrocket to $130,000. Alternatively, a sharp drop below $100,000 signals that the bears have seized control. That may tempt several short-term bulls to book profits, pulling the pair toward the 50-day simple moving average ($91,447).BTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe pair has broken out of the symmetrical triangle pattern on the 4-hour chart, indicating that buyers are in control. There is resistance at $105,820, but it is likely to be crossed. If that happens, the pair could march toward the all-time high of $109,588 and thereafter to the pattern target of $110,922.Sellers are likely to have other plans. They will try to pull the price back into the triangle. If that happens, the aggressive bulls may get trapped, pulling the pair to $100,000. If this level also cracks, the drop could extend to the target objective of $95,616.Ether price predictionEther dipped back below the breakout level of $2,550, but the bears are struggling to sustain the lower levels.ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe upsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($2,275) and the RSI near the overbought zone suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside. If the price closes above $2,550, the bulls will try to strengthen their position by pushing the ETH/USDT pair above $2,739. If they manage to do that, the pair could surge toward $3,000.The first sign of weakness will be a break below the $2,400 level. That could pull the pair to the 20-day EMA, which is a critical level to watch out for. A break below the 20-day EMA suggests the bulls are losing their grip.ETH/USDT 4-hour chart.

A break and close above $2,739 could resume the uptrend.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the downtrend line and breaks below $2,400, it signals that the bulls are rushing to the exit. That could start a deeper correction to $2,270 and then to $2,111. Hyperliquid price predictionHyperliquid (HYPE) is facing resistance at $28.50, but a positive sign is that the bulls have not ceded much ground to the bears.HYPE/USDT daily chart.

A break and close above $28.50 could catapult the HYPE/USDT pair toward $35.73.If the price turns down sharply from $28.50, it signals that the bears are aggressively defending the level. The pair could then slide to the 20-day EMA ($23.52), which is likely to attract buyers.

2025-05-18T15:00:00.000Z,"Don’t believe the noise: There can never be too many L2s","Opinion by: Igor Mandrigin, co-founder and CTPO of Gateway.fmEvery couple of weeks, it seems another layer 2 rolls out, much to the chagrin of some Web3 industry commentators who are concerned about fragmentation. A recent Gemini Institutional Insights report actually noted how a new Ethereum L2 solution is launched approximately every 19 days. In response to the seemingly endless conveyor belt of new zkEVMs and optimistic rollups coming to market, the chorus of criticism continues to grow louder: “This is definitely the saturation point, no more chains are needed.”Some of the most outspoken critics of L2s argue that L2s are redundant, but this is narrow thinking. In many ways, the idea that creating new L2s should be slowed down is like arguing that there were too many websites in 1998. The proliferation of L2s is not causing the Web3 space to become overly bloated or fragmented at all. The number of chains today isn’t too many. It’s laughably few, and right now is the early innings of a multi-decade explosion in specialized, modular blockchain infrastructure.The rise of L2s is far from a passing fadWhile some contend that this L2 surge we’ve been experiencing is merely a temporary frenzy led by DeFi degenerates, it’s really an enterprise-grade infrastructure expansion, as banks (including Deutsche Bank), game studios (gaming activity on some L2 blockchains rose by over 20,000% in February 2025), logistics networks and global manufacturers get on board. Industries like banking and logistics, which are typically risk-averse, don’t make major tech pivots lightly. They do so because they have to, and in many cases, public blockchains do not meet their needs. Returning to their inherent risk-averse DNA, large enterprises and institutions in these sectors generally won’t want to build on shared, general-purpose L1s. Instead, they’ll want to deploy their own chains where they can enjoy custom performance, predictable costs, jurisdictional compliance and granular-level privacy.This focus on proprietary networks isn’t solely a Web3 thing. Let’s think about it. Did Facebook, Netflix and JPMorgan co-host on GeoCities? Of course not, so why would Web3 be any different? Shared L1s and monolithic architectures might have worked for early token experiments and composable DeFi primitives. Still, realistically, they can’t support real-world businesses’ complexity, regulatory burden or contractual requirements.The growing viability of L2sThanks to modular stacks, rollup-as-a-service platforms and breakthrough zero-knowledge proof technology, spinning up a dedicated chain is becoming increasingly viable and accessible to a wide range of enterprises across the industry spectrum. As the infrastructure improves, the cost of launching and maintaining specialized chains will also reduce, so a substantial rise in the number of L2s can be expected as time goes on.Recent: Devs introduce Ethereum R1 layer-2 scaling solutionSome onlookers will argue that this future will be convoluted for users forced to hop between chains while voicing concerns about liquidity fragmentation and the dispersal of tradable assets across multiple platforms. These are short-sighted concerns. We’re building toward seamless interoperability through shared settlement layers, trust-minimized bridges and unified account abstraction. Ultimately, the end-user won’t care whether they’re on rollup #4,318 or chain #9,072; they’ll just transact with ease and be happy with that. In the same way that cloud computing unlocked hyper scale by abstracting the hardware layer, modular blockchains are unlocking hyperscale for value transfer, asset issuance and programmable trust. Irrespective of what the doubters say, specialized L2s won’t cannibalize each other. They’ll serve different verticals, jurisdictions and use cases. There is no reason why an L2 for high-frequency trading can’t easily coexist with an L2 for national land registries.We’re not drowning in chains — we’re barely ankle-deep in the grand scheme of things. Anyone seriously betting on consolidation or some magical “winner-take-all” chain is just betting against scale and sovereignty. The real bet is hundreds of L2s and thousands of use cases as part of one modular, scalable future.Opinion by: Igor Mandrigin, co-founder and CTPO of Gateway.fm.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-18T09:40:57.000Z,"‘Bitcoin Standard’ author backs funding dev to make spamming Bitcoin costly","Economist and author of The Bitcoin Standard, Saifedean Ammous, has weighed in on the ongoing debate over spam inscriptions on the Bitcoin network, suggesting he would “throw in a few sats” to fund a full-time developer focused on making Bitcoin spamming more difficult and expensive.Ammous made the remarks in response to a thread initiated by the pseudonymous developer GrassFedBitcoin, who called for Bitcoin Core to merge pull request #28408, which would enable node operators to filter inscriptions more easily.According to GrassFedBitcoin, the lack of inscription filtering tools contributes to unnecessary blockchain bloat and undermines Bitcoin (BTC)’s role as a monetary protocol.“No one running a node wants to relay inscriptions,” he wrote, arguing that the OP_RETURN limit increases were justified in the past under false assumptions. He pushed for a configurable, default policy discouraging the use of Bitcoin for storing JPEGs rather than monetary data.Blockstream CEO Adam Back challenged the proposal, describing inscription filtering as an “arms race.” He noted that spam data embedded in Bitcoin transactions can be endlessly modified using code structures, requiring constant updates to filtering tools.Source: Adam BackRelated: Bitcoin Ordinals vs. Ethereum NFTs: A comparative overviewAmmous compares Bitcoin spam to emailAmmous compared the Bitcoin spam issue to email spam — another arms race society continues to fight without abandoning the system.“It’s not easy, but it’s worth trying to help bankrupt the spammers faster,” Ammous said. He argued that fighting spam is not censorship, noting that node operators already reject invalid transactions.“So a node runner looking to remove retards' spam is no less valid than retards' spam,” he added.The debate drew commentary from other users.

But in March, Suman received a text message appearing to be from Coinbase, warning him of unauthorized account access.After responding, he got a phone call from a man identifying himself as a Coinbase security staffer named Brett Miller. The caller appeared knowledgeable, correctly stating that Suman’s funds were stored in a hardware wallet.He then convinced Suman that his wallet could still be vulnerable and walked him through a “security procedure” that involved entering his seed phrase into a website mimicking Coinbase’s interface.Nine days later, a second caller claiming to be from Coinbase repeated the process.

2025-05-17T15:21:23.000Z,"A Bitcoiner’s guide to South Africa’s Garden Route","South Africa’s Garden Route, famed for its lush forests, expansive beaches and charming towns, has become a testbed for Bitcoin adoption.From Mossel Bay to Witsand and Plettenberg Bay to Knysna, Bitcoin has become popular among shop owners and travelers alike for a multitude of reasons.“We’re seeing the early signs of a parallel, permissionless economy emerging across an entire region,” James Caw, founder of SimplB — a local crypto asset provider — told Cointelegraph, “where small businesses benefit from faster, lower-cost digital payments and where people have more options to earn, send and receive sound money securely.”For tourists, the benefits are immediate: no currency exchange hassles, no international card fees, and the ability to pay instantly and securely. For locals, Bitcoin (BTC) offers a hedge against inflation, protection from currency volatility and new economic opportunities.Here’s a taste of what a Bitcoin-friendly trip along the Garden Route is like.The Garden Route is where Bitcoin meets paradiseThe Garden Route is one of South Africa’s premier tourist corridors. It stretches roughly 300 kilometers from Mossel Bay in the west to the Storms River Mouth in the east, attracting hundreds of thousands of tourists yearly.Crypto adoption is escalating thanks to South Africa’s regulatory environment, which now recognizes Bitcoin as a financial product. Across the Garden Route, you can spend pre-acquired Bitcoin freely, with little concern for local tax or exchange controls.It’s a grassroots movement. Towns like Witsand and Plettenberg Bay are at the forefront, and national retailers like Pick n Pay provide a safety net for crypto spending along the way. Every Pick n Pay store, including supermarkets, clothing outlets and Express convenience stores, accepts Bitcoin via the CryptoQR app. This guarantees you can always buy daily goods with Bitcoin wherever you travel. Related: Stablecoin fever: 5 major stablecoins are growing crypto adoptionWitsand is the Bitcoin villageLocated at the mouth of the Breede River, Witsand is a sleepy coastal town with a big reputation in the Bitcoin world. Here, Bitcoin isn’t just accepted — it’s preferred.It’s thanks to the efforts of local champions like Edwin Jones, a software engineer and passionate supporter of Bitcoin adoption in the Garden Route. Witsand has become a functioning Bitcoin circular economy. Accommodation options like Fantasea and Happy Days holiday homes, meals at Ellie’s on Main, groceries at local shops, gym memberships, boat services, petrol, surf lessons and mini-golf can be paid for using Bitcoin.As Jones notes: Bitcoin Witsand existed long before we gave it a name. It was just having conversations with friends, and as the local businesses started understanding Bitcoin, they actually demanded we start getting the technology in place.The town’s small and close-knit community has enabled rapid adoption; more than 45 establishments accept Bitcoin as of early 2025. The town’s enthusiasm is infectious, as locals and visitors enjoy the ease and security of digital payments.Witsand proudly announces its acceptance of Bitcoin. Source: Edwin JonesWitsand’s success as a Bitcoin hub is rooted in its community-driven approach. Jones outlines its growth by outlining that: Although there have been many individual businesses over the years since 2009 that started and stopped accepting Bitcoin for the Garden Route, the adoption really started kicking off in 2021.“With the Lightning Network starting to reach maturity around that time, the first Spaza Shop in Mossel Bay, Bitcoin Ekasi, started accepting Bitcoin in August 2021, and the first restaurant in Witsand in December of the same year.”Education has been central to the process. Local advocates have focused on teaching business owners the fundamentals of Bitcoin, warning against scams and emphasizing the difference between Bitcoin and speculative altcoins. “With all the circular economies advocating against gambling and trading, cautioning against interest and investments, being explicitly Bitcoin, and focusing on the fundamentals rather than the price, scammers have been kept at bay,” Jones said. “We have also found that businesses don’t have to adapt as much as evolve.”Bitcoin doesn’t change a business — it just supercharges it. Doing the same old things, much better.Mossel Bay’s surf and social upliftmentMossel Bay, the historical gateway to the Garden Route, is not just about beaches and maritime history. Mossel Bay is home to Bitcoin Ekasi, a pioneering project that brought Bitcoin to the township of JCC Camp.Bitcoin Ekasi empowers unbanked residents by enabling them to earn and spend Bitcoin locally. Coaches at The Surfer Kids nonprofit are paid in Bitcoin, and local spaza shops accept Bitcoin for daily necessities.For the Bitcoiner tourist, Mossel Bay offers a unique opportunity for “conscious crypto-tourism.” You can take surf lessons from instructors paid in Bitcoin, visit the Bitcoin Ekasi education center, or support the project with direct donations.The town also boasts a Pick n Pay that accepts Bitcoin. As SimplB’s Caw observes: The Bitcoin Ekasi project first started when they began accepting Bitcoin because of the demand from foreign tourists visiting Mossel Bay. It is just so simple to function on a Bitcoin standard once you begin using it.Plettenberg Bay is the fastest-growing Bitcoin economyFurther east, Plettenberg Bay has witnessed an explosion in Bitcoin adoption. In just a few months, the number of Bitcoin-accepting merchants jumped from five to more than 75, making it one of Africa’s most dynamic crypto economies.Confirmed acceptors include Ferris Cars (which facilitates rental accommodation payments in crypto), Glow Lighting Design and all local Pick n Pay branches. Adventure tourism companies, boutique retailers and professional services are increasingly receptive to Bitcoin, especially if you ask. The rapid growth suggests an enthusiastic local scene, with businesses eager to tap into the spending power of Bitcoin tourists.Related: 8 major crypto firms announce US expansion this yearPlettenberg Bay offers a vibrant mix of beach life, nature and crypto-friendly commerce. The town’s energy is palpable, and visitors are encouraged to engage with merchants, share information about Lightning payments, and help grow the ecosystem.“Right now Plettenberg Bay is by far the most interesting circular economy in Africa and possibly the world,” said Jones. “It currently boasts having the most businesses accepting Bitcoin of any town in Africa and has achieved this in less than three months.”Bitcoin preferred signs can be found along the Garden Route. Source: Edwin JonesSedgefield is a quiet pioneerSedgefield, a tranquil town between Knysna and Wilderness, played a key role in the national rollout of Bitcoin payments at Pick n Pay. It was one of the trial sites for the innovative QR code converter from MoneyBadger, which enables Bitcoin spending at every Pick n Pay in South Africa.Sedgefield itself doesn’t have the same density of Bitcoin-accepting independent merchants as Witsand or Plettenberg Bay, but the presence of Pick n Pay ensures that crypto tourists can always pay for groceries and essentials with sats.Practical information for your tripIf you do make it out to the Garden Route, recommended wallets include Blink, Wallet of Satoshi and Phoenix — all Lightning-enabled and widely used in the region. In larger towns like Knysna, George, Wilderness and Oudtshoorn, the Bitcoin scene is still emerging. There aren’t yet established circular economies, but the nationwide acceptance of Bitcoin at Pick n Pay provides a reliable foundation for spending.The Spasie on Breede Restaurant and Bar is just one of many establishments accepting Bitcoin. Source: Edwin JonesBTC Map occasionally lists independent merchants, like Beans About Coffee in Oudtshoorn. Still, the best strategy is to ask around, look for Bitcoin signage, and use mapping tools to discover new acceptors.For accommodation, activities and dining, direct inquiry remains key. Many guesthouses and tour operators are open to Bitcoin payments, especially as awareness grows. Online platforms like Bitrefill enable you to buy gift vouchers for major retailers using Bitcoin, providing a workaround for places that don’t yet accept crypto directly.Happy travels.Magazine: Pranksy: Inside the anonymous life of an NFT legend — NFT Collector",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoiners-guide-south-africa-garden-route?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-17T15:00:00.000Z,"The DeFi mullet — Fintech needs DeFi in the back","Opinion by: Merlin Egalite, co-founder at Morpho LabsFintechs in the front, decentralized finance (DeFi) in the back: the DeFi Mullet.Today’s fintech companies offer excellent user experiences but are constrained by traditional financial infrastructure — siloed, slow, expensive and inflexible. Meanwhile, DeFi provides lightning-fast, cost-effective, interoperable infrastructure but lacks mainstream accessibility.The solution? Combine fintech’s distribution and user experience with DeFi’s efficient back end.The mullet is inevitableFintech companies heavily rely on traditional financial (TradFi) infrastructure that is siloed, slow to deploy and run, and costly to maintain. This inefficiency limits their control over costs and product offerings and has potential infrastructure risks. Fintechs have a strong incentive to transition to building on autonomous, credibly neutral public infrastructure.The power of DeFi is evident in stablecoins. While traditional international wire transfers cost $30–$50 and take one to five business days, stablecoin transfers cost mere cents and settle in seconds. This revolutionary improvement in financial infrastructure extends beyond payments. DeFi provides 24/7/365 infrastructure for trading, lending and borrowing with instant settlement, open access and deep liquidity, enabling better price execution and yields.Plugging their compliance-ready front end into DeFi infrastructure, fintech companies can focus on creating exceptional user experiences. This opens up tremendous opportunities for innovation while driving more liquidity onchain, creating a positive feedback loop of embracing the DeFi Mullet.Now is the time for mainstream adoptionToday’s DeFi ecosystem has proven its reliability for fintech integration. There are dozens of protocols that demonstrate this maturity, securely managing billions in loans through immutable, governance-minimized designs. DeFi infrastructure gives fintechs complete control over their infrastructure. This is particularly crucial after the recent Synapse bankruptcy that trapped Yotta user funds meant to be insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.Recent: Bitcoin DeFi will have 300M users, beating Ethereum and Solana: ExecInstitutions are also coming onchain. BlackRock has tokenized a fund via Securitize; Stripe has acquired Bridge for $1 billion to scale its stablecoin solutions; the US is creating a strategic Bitcoin (BTC) reserve; and clarity on regulation is opening the floodgates. The shift is step-by-step but tangible.DeFi has arrived.The next phaseFor years to come, expect more products like crypto-backed loans to be released by fintech’s most advanced players, offering onchain saving accounts, onchain loans, instant international payments and more. This transformation will be invisible to users and powered by smart wallets and account abstraction that maintain the familiar Web2-like user experience at which fintech companies excel. Early adopters will gain significant advantages over competitors.Yet, unlike building on traditional finance, DeFi’s open infrastructure means even latecomers can benefit from existing network effects without starting from zero.Some skeptics argue that the involvement of fintechs and traditional institutions will erode decentralization, as protocols must comply with regulatory requirements. While this concern is understandable, the opposite is more likely.Expecting protocols to achieve compliance across every jurisdiction worldwide is unrealistic, especially given the vast regulatory fragmentation. Instead, regulating the apps that interface with users makes far more sense rather than the underlying protocols. For this regulatory model to work, however, protocols must remain credibly neutral.A credibly neutral mechanism adheres to four principles:It embeds no preference for specific individuals or outcomes.It is open-source with publicly verifiable execution.It is simple and understandable.It changes infrequently.Examples like HTTP and SMTP demonstrate the power of credibly neutral protocols — they are free, open and unregulated, with only the clients subject to oversight. The same logic should apply to governance-minimized, immutable DeFi protocols.These constraints will push DeFi builders toward creating genuinely decentralized and trustless systems.Fintechs integrating DeFi protocols can build on top of the most neutral infrastructure and access their growing network effects.Let the mullet growThe DeFi mullet is more than just a meme — it’s a structural shift.To scale, DeFi must meet users where they are: through regulated, user-friendly fintech channels. For fintechs to stay relevant, they must offer their customers the best user experience and opportunities, such as the best rates. Those who miss this opportunity risk falling into irrelevance, much like traditional retail banks losing market share to today’s fintechs.This convergence isn’t just possible — it’s inevitable.Opinion by: Merlin Egalite, co-founder at Morpho Labs.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Melker noted the company is not just entering the index but doing so in the top 50 by market cap — a reflection of how deeply rooted some crypto firms have become.In addition to Coinbase, firms like Galaxy Digital and eToro have moved forward with public listings, signaling confidence in regulatory conditions under the current US administration.Melker said that this environment, bolstered by dropped SEC lawsuits and favorable executive orders, has created what he calls “an extremely bullish” backdrop for the sector.While Bitcoin remains the primary focus, Melker acknowledged a renewed interest in altcoins. Recent price action saw Ethereum outpace Bitcoin, triggering a rally across smaller-cap tokens — a sign, he said, that “new money” is entering the space rather than just rotating within it.Related: Here is why Bitcoin price is stuck below $105KDon’t rule out a wild runDespite the optimism, Melker tempered expectations, noting that most experts are forecasting cycle highs between $120,000 and $150,000.

2025-05-17T09:12:28.000Z,"Everstake defends non-custodial staking as SEC weighs industry input","The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has held discussions with Everstake, one of the largest non-custodial staking providers globally, to explore clearer regulatory definitions around staking in blockchain networks.The meeting, which also involved the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, comes at a time when over $193 billion in digital assets are staked across major proof-of-stake (PoS) networks.However, despite the massive scale of participation, staking remains in a legal gray zone in the US as regulators wrestle with its classification under existing securities law.The previous SEC administration also took enforcement actions against major players such as Kraken, Coinbase, and Consensys due to their staking services. The agency, under pro-crypto President Donald Trump, has recently dismissed these enforcement actions.During the meeting, Everstake told the SEC that non-custodial staking should not be classified as a securities transaction. The company said that users maintain full control over their digital assets throughout the staking process and do not transfer ownership to a third party.They argued that this makes staking a technical function, not an investment product.“Our main assertion is that staking is not a financial instrument or security transaction, but rather a technical process, a base-layer protocol mechanism—akin to an oracle in a database—that maintains the integrity and functionality of decentralized networks,” Everstake founder Sergii Vasylchuk told Cointelegraph.Everstake team meeting with the SEC. Source: EverstakeRelated: SEC delays staking decision for Grayscale ETH ETFsEverstake calls for regulatory clarityIn a letter submitted to the SEC’s Crypto Task Force on April 8, 2025, Everstake asked the agency to extend regulatory clarity to non-custodial staking and custodial and liquid staking models.In the letter, which came in respond to Commissioner Hester Peirce’s call for input on regulatory treatment of blockchain services, Everstake argued that non-custodial staking should not be considered a securities offering.It claimed that non-custodial staking, where users retain control of their tokens, does not involve the pooling of assets or the expectation of profits from managerial efforts.In its model, Everstake said users delegate only validation rights while maintaining ownership of their digital assets. The staking rewards are algorithmically distributed by the blockchain network itself, and the firm merely provides technical infrastructure.Related: Ethereum ETF staking will have little impact without multimonth rally: AnalystNon-custodial staking fails the Howey testThe letter also details why non-custodial staking fails each prong of the Howey test. Users do not make an investment of money in a common enterprise, do not expect profits from Everstake’s efforts, and are not dependent on the company’s management for financial returns.Instead, any rewards come from network-level incentives and fluctuate with the market value of the underlying asset.Everstake proposes specific criteria that should exempt non-custodial staking from securities classification. These include user asset control, absence of pooled funds, permissionless unstaking, and the provision of purely technical services.It likens non-custodial staking to proof-of-work mining, which the SEC has previously ruled out as a securities transaction.Margaret Rosenfeld, Everstake’s chief legal officer, also told Cointelegraph that “with non-custodial staking, there’s no handover of assets, no investment contract, and no third-party risk.” She added:“Treating it as a securities offering undermines the decentralized model and risks chilling innovation in the blockchain sector.”Nevertheless, the SEC has so far withheld a definitive stance. Rosenfeld said that the agency did not make any “specific commitments” on staking guidance. However, it continues to listen to industry stakeholders.“The Task Force is actively engaging with a range of stakeholders—including those involved with non-custodial staking, ETFs, and broader blockchain infrastructure—to gather input.”In an April 30 letter to the SEC, nearly 30 crypto advocate groups led by the lobby group the Crypto Council for Innovation (CCI) asked the agency for clear regulatory guidance on crypto staking and staking services.Magazine: Binance Wallet ‘killing’ MetaMask and airdrops, Chinese RWA tokens: Asia Express",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/everstake-defends-non-everstake-sec-non-custodial-staking-guidance-staking-as-sec-weighs-industry-input?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-17T00:57:29.000Z,"Bitcoin bull flag and standard profit taking hint at eventual rally to new BTC price highs","Key takeaways: Traders expect a Bitcoin price pullback to $90,000, but a bull flag could break out to new highs if profit taking near the range highs reduces. On-chain data suggests the current profit taking is too weak to extinguish Bitcoin’s current price momentum. Bitcoin (BTC) price has spent the bulk of the week pinned below $104,000 to $105,000, which many analysts have labelled as a resistance zone, but an alternative view suggests that BTC is simply consolidating within a bull flag. A bull flag is a continuation pattern that is characterized by a period of sideways price action following a sharp uptrend, and when the structure confirms or breaks from the trendline resistance, the uptrend continues. BTC/USDT 1-day chart. Source: TRDR.ioWhile the range-bound trading portion of the flag is said to represent indecision from buyers and sellers, in this scenario, the absence of buy volume is the primary culprit. As shown in the TRDR.io chart below, Bitcoin’s explosive move to $105,900 from $74,400 was accompanied by large liquidations in the margin markets and robust spot volumes, which aligned with several days of billion-dollar spot BTC ETF inflows. BTC/USDT 1hr chart. Source: TRDR.ioDuring this three-week period, several US-based and international companies also announced plans to purchase Bitcoin and establish BTC treasuries. The spot and futures cumulative volume delta, along with the open interest metric on the chart show traders selling near the range highs and the absence of new long leverage and significantly sized spot positions being opened in this area, whereas drops to range low (bull flag support) sees bids filled on the spot side, but there is still limited use of margin for fresh longs. BTC/USD spot and margin CVD. Source: TRDR.ioBitcoin’s recent cool-down phase is a normal outcome after the near 40% recovery that started on April 8, and the loss of upward momentum resulting from profit-taking in futures markets near the current range high is also to be expected. Bitcoin short-term holder supply profit and loss data from Glassnode supports this view, as shown in the chart below. The onchain data company highlighted profit taking for short-term traders but explained that it does not exceed the statistical norm, leaving room for further price upside. “Recently, the magnitude of STH Realized Profit has surged to almost +3 standard deviations above its 90-day average, reflecting a notable uptick in profit realization. In past cycles, particularly during rallies towards the ATH, this metric has historically climbed to over +5 standard deviations of more.

This has additional benefits for data transmission in space, Belcher said.“The architecture is well-suited to space because it reduces delays, compensates for data corruption caused by radiation, and enables cryptographic verification to ensure data has not been tampered with,” she said.The foundation is a nonprofit governing the decentralized cloud storage protocol Filecoin (FIL), which uses the IPFS web protocol to store data. Lockheed Martin is one of the world’s largest aerospace companies.Source: Filecoin FoundationDecentralized storage benefits“There’s a multi-second delay from the Moon and a multi-minute delay from Mars,” Belcher said.“With IPFS, you look for a content ID and retrieve the data from wherever is closest — your own device, a nearby satellite, or a lunar station.”Additionally, the IPFS uses a distributed architecture to store multiple copies of data across a global network, reducing reliance on centralized data centers.These multiple copies of data improve reliability in environments where hardware is prone to degradation, helping to ensure the integrity of sensitive materials such as satellite images, according to Belcher.Interest in decentralized archival storage is growing among media companies, and the Foundation is also exploring potential military applications of this technology, Belcher said.“It could be really powerful for media in general to have that deep archive and also the ability to have your records everywhere all over the world when needed,” she said.The FIL token is a utility token that can be used within the Filecoin ecosystem.
