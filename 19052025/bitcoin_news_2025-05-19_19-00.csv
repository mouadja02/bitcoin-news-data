2025-05-19T16:58:41.000Z,"Best Crypto ICO 2025: Nexchain Leads Along With BTC Bull Token","The post Best Crypto ICO 2025: Nexchain Leads Along With BTC Bull Token appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The competition for the best cryptocurrency presale heats up, with two projects grabbing attention: Nexchain (NEX) and BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL). Nexchain has already collected $2.3 million in its presale cryptocurrency round, promising AI-powered scalability, low costs, and daily passive income. Meanwhile, the tokenomics of BTC Bull Token are closely linked to Bitcoin’s price success, with free BTC airdrops and deflationary mechanisms for each milestone BTC reaches. With authorities clarifying stablecoin and token laws, on-chain innovation is primed for rapid development. For investors looking for the best crypto ICO of 2025, these two presales provide real-world value, reputable audits, and innovative reward structures, making them must-see possibilities before they debut on major exchanges. Nexchain: The Best Long-Term Presale Crypto to Buy in 2025 Most presale tokens promise quick gains but provide little use, leaving late adopters with worthless money as the initial excitement subsides. Investors are well-versed in price manipulation, vacuous roadmaps, and nameless teams. Without a true technological edge or sustainable economics, many enterprises fail, draining faith and money. Nexchain is a fully CertiK-audited Layer-1 blockchain that combines Proof-of-Stake with AI to achieve throughput of 400,000 TPS, fees of $0.001, and environmentally friendly operation. Nexchain’s token presale distributes 10% of daily gas-fee revenue to NEX holders’ wallets with no staking necessary, resulting in a passive income stream that aligns incentives. Its on-chain DAO gives the community control over governance, while Smart Contracts 2.0 automatically upgrade for future-proof security. Nexchain is more than a presale crypto gamble, with just 20% of tokens in public sale and an entry price of $0.05 that targets $0.30 upon listing. It is a long-term infrastructure investment created for real-world AI and Web3 use cases. BTC Bull Presale: Rewards for Bitcoin Success As regulatory certainty supports institutional flows, Bitcoin remains the leading asset. BTC Bull Token capitalizes on this by rewarding holders with actual bitcoin when prices rise. At each $50,000 milestone—beginning at $150,000—BTC Bull provides free BTC airdrops to token holders. Each $25,000 price increase, starting at Bitcoin’s $125,000 level, triggers the token’s deflationary burn to ensure scarcity. This concept pushes BTC Bull to the top cryptocurrency presales of 2025, providing both price exposure and substantial BTC incentives. The project’s combination of on-chain mechanics and airdrop incentives makes it one of the greatest cryptocurrency ICOs to invest in before Bitcoin’s next step higher. Final Words: Nexchain Remains the Top Crypto ICO of 2025. While BTC Bull Token reflects Bitcoin’s momentum, Nexchain stands out as the preferred presale cryptocurrency for individuals seeking long-term value and technical innovation. Its design addresses the triple threat of speed, security, and decentralization. Nexchain has a 78/100 CertiK audit, whale-level demand, and a clear path for Web3 AI services, providing investors with the basics they want for long-term success. As the 2025 bull run gains traction, NEX remains the finest crypto presale to purchase for individuals devoted to next-generation blockchain usefulness and long-term rewards.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/best-crypto-ico-2025-nexchain-leads-along-with-btc-bull-token/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|TOKEN SALE","Press Release",cryptocompare
2025-05-19T16:55:08.000Z,"Large US Companies Witness Highest Number of Bankruptcy Filings in 15 Years Amid Souring Consumer Sentiment, According to Analyst","A widely followed market analyst is sounding the alarm about the surging number of large US companies going bankrupt this year. Citing data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, Adam Kobeissi, the founder and editor-in-chief of The Kobeissi Letter, tells his 898,600 followers on the social media platform X that 246 large US firms have gone bankrupt year-to-date, the highest number in 15 years. According to Kobeissi, dozens of big companies filed for bankruptcy just last month amid the peak of President Trump’s trade war. “[246] is up from 206 recorded last year and more than DOUBLE during the same period in 2022. In April alone, the US saw 59 bankruptcy filings as tariffs ramped up. So far this year, the industrials sector has seen 41 bankruptcies, followed by 31 in consumer discretionary, and 17 in healthcare. According to S&P Global, consumer discretionary companies have been hit the hardest due to market volatility, tariffs, and inflation uncertainty. We expect a surge in bankruptcies in 2025.” Source: The Kobeissi Letter/X The wave of bankruptcies appears to coincide with a decline in consumer sentiment. Kobeissi says the data suggests that American consumers are becoming increasingly concerned about the economy. “US consumer sentiment is getting even worse: The Consumer Sentiment index declined 1.4 points, to 52.2, the second-lowest reading in the history of the survey. This is even lower than 2008 and the 1980s recession. Current conditions fell 2.2 points, to 57.6, the second-weakest level on record. Concerningly, consumer expectations decreased 0.8 points, to 46.5, the lowest in 45 years. This survey took place between April 22 and May 13, concluding 2 days after the US-China trade deal.

2025-05-19T16:46:35.000Z,"Arthur Hayes Says The Real Altseason Everyone’s Been Waiting For Will Start Once This Happens","Bitcoin has reached new all-time highs multiple times, yet many top altcoins are still lagging behind their previous cycle peaks. So, what gives? Is altseason just delayed, or could it be that it won’t come at all? According to crypto OG Arthur Hayes, the long-awaited powerful altcoin rally will only start after Bitcoin soars above the $110,000 level and rallies toward $200,000. When Will Altseason Arrive? Speaking with Fortune Crypto, the outspoken crypto mogul and former BitMEX CEO said he expects Bitcoin to go parabolic and reach these sky-high heights in the “summer or early third quarter.” A rotation of capital from Bitcoin into various altcoins will then follow, with Hayes foreseeing a potential upsurge. Altseason is a period when altcoins outperform Bitcoin. Historically, altcoin seasons occur when traders rotate profits out of the benchmark cryptocurrency and into other cryptocurrencies. However, Hayes cautioned that this will be a very selective alt season. Unlike the meteoric altcoin surge of 2021, where almost all tokens pumped hard regardless of fundamentals, only a few coins will surge during the upcoming cycle. In his view, a new narrative will spark attention and speculative trading in certain tokens, but he notes that “dino coins” are unlikely to recover. “A lot of those coins have high FDV, low float, no customers, no revenue, just some CEX listings, that went down 95%, I don’t really see why those should do well in the next cycle,” the pundit explained. Bitcoin staged a sharp rally past $106,000 on Sunday, only to reverse course and dump back to around $102,000 as of press time. Hayes, who received a presidential pardon from President Donald Trump earlier this year, predicts a Bitcoin rocket to $200K in the next leg up and hit $250,000 by year-end. A $1 million Bitcoin price tag could be attained by 2028 as Trump leaves office, per the ex-BitMEX boss. Ether vs. Solana Regarding Ethereum versus Solana, Hayes believes the second-largest blockchain has more bullish prospects. The crypto OG reckons that Ether’s underlying fundamentals and ecosystem resilience make it a better bet than SOL in the coming months, despite its recent underwhelming price action and the heavy criticism it draws from skeptics. “I think that Ethereum could outperform Solana in this next sort of 18-24 months bull run,” he stated.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/arthur-hayes-says-the-real-altseason-everyones-been-waiting-for-will-start-once-this-happens/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|SOL|TRADING","Altcoins|Bitcoin|News|Altcoin Season|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare
2025-05-19T16:45:06.000Z,"Can XRP Hit $3 This Week? Bulls Step In as $2.30 Holds Strong (XRP Price Prediction)","XRP has dipped 4.5% over the past week as its recent rally cools off, taking a breather after gaining strong momentum since last Wednesday. Does this pullback invalidate a bullish XRP price prediction ? The token is currently trading at $2.31, having faced heavy resistance at $2.66. Despite the dip, trading volume has surged 72% in the past 24 hours, suggesting continued interest even as the price slides 3% on the day. Still, XRP remains the top-performing cryptocurrency among the top 5 this year, delivering an impressive 11.4% YTD return – edging out Bitcoin (BTC) , which has gained 10.3% in the same period. Ripple Payments momentum is building in the UAE. https://t.co/gFiwxXWfM5 Following our DFSA license, Zand Bank and @MamoPay are now live on Ripple Payments—bringing always-on, blockchain-powered cross-border payments to one of the world’s top remittance hubs. — Ripple (@Ripple) May 19, 2025 Notably, Ripple announced today that two new enterprise customers have been onboarded to its payments platform in the United Arab Emirates, just a few weeks after they received a license to operate as a crypto-native payments provider from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA). XRP Price Prediction: Price Action Bounces Off 50-Day EMA The daily chart shows that Ripple’s price action has found support at the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) so far during today’s session and this still favors a bullish XRP price forcast for the time being. The price has broken the 21-day EMA, which has not been reliable support for the token for a while, but it is still trading above the 200-day EMA, meaning that the long-term trend is still bullish. Following XRP’s breakout from its descending triangle, the price has already printed two higher highs, maintaining its bullish structure as long as it stays above the second-highest peak. The \\$2.30 level remains a crucial support — as long as it holds, the uptrend stays intact and there’s minimal short-term reversal risk on the horizon. Today’s session will be key in gauging bulls’ conviction. If late buyers step in at this level, it could mark a strong continuation point for the rally, offering a compelling entry for those eyeing further upside. Strong trading volume at this range signals that it’s a major area of interest for market participants — making it a critical level over the coming weeks. Should the structure break, the 200-day EMA will serve as the next major support to monitor. As the crypto market continues to recover, keeping your cryptocurrencies safely stored is critical.

Major U.S. stocks were mixed after a credit agency dealt a blow to U.S. public finances. On Monday, May 19, the Dow Jones was trading at 42,676 points, up 21.91 points or 0.05% from the market open. The S&P 500 was at 5,944, down 0.24%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq traded at 19,139, down 0.37%. You might also like: Moody’s cuts US credit rating, Bitcoin doesn’t flinch The decline came after Moody’s, one of the biggest credit rating agencies, downgraded the U.S. credit rating from Aaa to Aa1. The move brings the firm’s rating in line with that of Standard & Poor’s and Fitch, which downgraded the rating in 2011 and 2023, respectively. As a result of the downgrade, U.S. Treasury yields spiked dramatically. The 30-year Treasury yield spiked to 5.03%, the highest level since November 2023. The 10-year and the 2-year Treasury yields increased to 4.5% and 3.993%, respectively. The U.S. has an ongoing debt problem: Moody’s The U.S. credit rating is significant because it directly impacts the cost of government borrowing. When Treasury yields spike, the U.S. government has to pay more in interest on any newly issued Treasuries. This can create a vicious cycle where the interest cost hurts the ability to pay, causing investors to look elsewhere and increasing borrowing costs even further. Moody’s cited escalating government deficits as the reason for the downgrade and stated that these have been a problem for a while. What is more, the agency directly referenced the possibility of extending 2017 tax cuts, which could add $4 trillion to the deficit. “Successive U.S. administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs. We do not believe that material multi-year reductions in mandatory spending and deficits will result from current fiscal proposals under consideration,” Moody’s analysts.

2025-05-19T16:37:54.000Z,"Michael Saylor’s Strategy Expands Bitcoin Holdings With Latest $765 Million Purchase Amid Class Action Lawsuit","It’s Monday in crypto, so you know what that means: Bitcoin treasury firm Strategy has announced another big buy. However, the latest purchase came as the Tysons, Virginia-based company, was hit with a class action lawsuit. Another $764.9 Million in Bitcoin Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin development company, Strategy — formerly known as MicroStrategy — added 7,390 BTC to its balance sheet from May 12 to May 18, spending a cool $764.9 million on the digital asset, according to an 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 19. https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1924436184664559807 The purchase brings its total holdings to 576,230 BTC, now valued at over $59 billion at current market prices. That’s equivalent to 2.74% of Bitcoin’s total 21 million supply. Strategy’s average purchase price for its entire Bitcoin stash now stands at $69,726. Strategy’s latest purchase comes as Metaplanet fortifies its standing as Asia’s answer to Strategy. The Tokyo-listed firm also announced on Monday that it had snapped up 1,004 BTC, costing around $104.8 million. The purchases by these two Bitcoin-stacking companies likely helped the asset jump to nearly $107,000 on Sunday. Bitcoin was recently trading for $104,607, according to CoinGecko data. Strategy Slapped With Class Action Lawsuit Strategy’s May 19 regulatory filing also reveals that the company is facing a class action lawsuit filed in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The company’s Executive Chairman, Michael Saylor, President and CEO, Phong Le, and executive vice president and chief financial officer, Andrew Kang, are named as defendants in the suit. The suit accuses Strategy officials of “violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. “The [suit claims] that the named defendants made false and/or misleading statements with respect to and/or failed to disclose information with respect to the anticipated profitability of our Bitcoin-focused investment strategy and treasury operations, and the various risks associated with Bitcoin’s volatility,” the lawsuit reads. Crypto commentator 0xngmi suggested in a Monday post on X that the suit is baseless. 0xngmi believes that it “seems to be people complaining that [Strategy] understated how much money it could lose if BTC went down.” Still, he contended that the risks were not understated: “You’re buying a company that is self-labelled as “leverage on Bitcoin,” what do you expect?” Meanwhile, Strategy has said it will “vigorously” defend itself against the allegations outlined in the class action lawsuit.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/michael-saylors-strategy-expands-bitcoin-holdings-with-latest-765-million-purchase-amid-class-action-lawsuit/,"BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|ZRX","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Michael Saylor|MicroStrategy",cryptocompare

Despite the milestone, XRP market prices remained weak. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) launched the live trading of its long-awaited XRP futures. The contract started trading on May 19, with still limited volumes. Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO and co-founder of Ripple, announced the launch as an institutional milestone for XRP. The launch of regulated XRP Futures on @CMEGroup marks a key institutional milestone for XRP…and very excited to report that Hidden Road cleared the first block trade on CME at the opening! https://t.co/Njj8AUSY5K — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) May 19, 2025 Hidden Road, the recently acquired brokerage, was among the first CME traders to trade a package of XRP in the first hours of futures trading. XRP traded at $2.35 after the launch, matching the market price for the past day. The asset is down by 3.2% in the past day, erasing 8% in the past week to become one of the weak performers among blue chip assets. XRP price chart | Source: Coingecko The CME announced the futures contract launch in a document from April 24, joining the company’s futures markets for BTC, ETH, and SOL. CME offers cash-settled XRP futures The new contract is regulated by the US Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for transparent and efficient contracts. The contracts are settled based on the CME CF XRP-Dollar reference rate. The futures trade in 50,000 XRP units and are cash-settled. Traders will also have the small-contract version containing 2,500 XRP. The futures will be quoted in six consecutive monthly contracts, four quarterly contracts, and a second December settlement contract. The XRP futures settle at 4:00 PM London time on the last Friday of the contract month or the business day prior if the expiration day is a bank holiday. This means the contract bets on XRP price fluctuations, but no XRP is bought and used. Previous futures market launches did not generate additional crypto demand but became a part of price discovery, gauging sentiment and showing potential price moves on crypto exchanges. XRP still awaits a decision on 19 filings for an ETF launch, aiming to become a part of mainstream portfolios. The futures market will gauge mainstream institutional demand and point toward the success of an eventual ETF. XRP showed price weakness ahead of futures launch The futures launched just as XRP hype was diminishing. Since May 14, open interest for the asset fell from $2.6B down to $2B on a series of liquidations. XRP traders still hold predominantly long positions due to fears of a short squeeze. Despite this, in the past 12 hours, over $12.4M were liquidated from XRP long positions . As usual, XRP is met with a mix of skepticism and irrational optimism, allowing for a rally as high as $10. XRP still has no clear utility, and Ripple has branched into other activities, including oracles and fintech. However, the asset has earned its spot among traders as an asset with reliable and liquid listings. Despite the milestone, XRP has not rallied as expected. The price still faced pressure from the still-unsettled lawsuit that is clearing out the last technicalities, though the central verdict that XRP is not a security is not disputed.

2025-05-19T16:33:46.000Z,"Criminals Hunt Families of Crypto Entrepreneurs","Crypto company executives are increasingly concerned about the rising number of attacks aimed at stealing and extorting digital assets, so they are turning to the services of bodyguards. This was reported by the WSJ . On May 13, the daughter of Paymium cryptocurrency exchange founder Pierre Noizat was attacked by three masked men in the Parisian neighborhood of Le Marais. The attackers, armed with gas spray cans and a toy gun, attempted to drag the woman and her child into a minibus. The victim's husband intervened and received a blow to the head, while a neighbor managed to get the child to safety. The attackers fled as locals began to rush to the scene. This incident is part of a global wave of violent attacks in which criminals use physical force rather than digital tools to extort cryptocurrency. In recent months alone, five such cases have been recorded in France. In Estonia, an Australian crypto billionaire narrowly escaped kidnapping, and in Houston, USA, an influencer's home was attacked at night by assailants demanding her laptop. ”People are getting to the 'hide the gold under the mattress' level, but that doesn't protect against real threats,” said Casa co-founder Jameson Lopp. Crime in the industry has intensified amid the rising value of Bitcoin and a surge in data breaches. In 2020, hackers breached Ledger's customer database, revealing the addresses of 272,000 users. Later, a similar incident occurred with Kroll, giving attackers access to the personal data of Genesis customers. Information from these leaks is now being distributed on the darknet. ”The younger generation is great at doxxing-they match data from different sources to find the victim,” explained MetaMask researcher Taylor Monahan. France Prioritizes Security On May 14, 2025, French Interior Minister Bruno Retaillot held a meeting with representatives of the crypto industry, proposing new security measures. According to him, the organizers of these attacks often recruit perpetrators through Telegram, remaining in the shadows. One of the most high-profile cases was the kidnapping of Ledger co-founder David Balland in January. The criminals cut off his finger and demanded €10 million in USDT. The crypto community is reacting to these threats by hiding profiles on social media and removing addresses from public registries. Noizat called on authorities to review customer data disclosure requirements to reduce the risks associated with leaks. Halte à la mexicanization de la France.

Coinbase Reveals Data Theft and Refuses to Pay $20 Million Ransom The Coinbase exchange reported the theft of user data due to the bribery of overseas support staff. The platform's team refused to pay a $20 million ransom. Cybercriminals bribed and recruited rogue overseas support agents to obtain personal data on less than 1% of Coinbase MTUs. No passwords, private keys, or funds were exposed. Prime accounts were untouched. We will reimburse affected customers. Coinbase 🛡️ (@coinbase) May 15, 2025 On May 11, the company received an email from an attacker claiming to have some customer account information as well as internal documents. Update: Coinbase will spend between $180 million and $400 million to resolve the incident and compensate customers, according to the company's report to the SEC on May 15. Some users criticized the company for its delayed acknowledgment of the leak. Wintermute CEO Eugene Gaevoy stated: ”This is the dark side of the idiotic and pointless KYC/AML regime we live in. It makes life a little more convenient for law enforcement and geopolitical games, while sacrificing our privacy, heavily taxing virtually all businesses, and making it easier for criminals to rob, kidnap, and commit crimes.” The hackers reportedly paid several contractors and help desk employees outside the U.S. to gather information from internal systems. As a result, the attackers gained access to less than 1% of customers' data, including names, addresses, and emails, according to the trading platform's blog. However, passwords, private keys, and user funds were not affected. Customer assets on the Coinbase Prime service were also unaffected. The exchange announced compensation for users who sent cryptocurrency to fraudsters as a result of social engineering attacks. Coinbase has also strengthened security measures: High-risk accounts are now subject to additional scrutiny for large withdrawals. The company is opening a new support center in the U.S. and strengthening security controls and monitoring across all divisions. It is also investing in insider threat detection. Instead of paying a $20 million ransom for silence, Coinbase has created a prize fund of the same amount to reward those who help find the attackers. The exchange is working with law enforcement, and the fired insiders have been handed over to investigators. Coinbase reminded users that company representatives will never call to request fund transfers to ”safe accounts” or ask for 2FA codes.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9179/criminals-hunt-families-of-crypto-entrepreneurs,"BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION|WALLET","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

2025-05-19T16:30:36.000Z,"Why is Solana down 6% over the past 24 hours?","Solana is down 6%, reflecting a broader decline in the markets, as liquidations contribute to volatility. Solana (SOL) is down amid a broader market decline, caused by a spike in liquidations. On Monday, May 19, Solana dropped 6.02%, trading at $163.97 amid a sector-wide pullback caused by the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. Almost all crypto tokens that aren’t stablecoins were in the red today, with a few suffering double-digit losses. Bitcoin was the least affected, only losing 0.52% and still trading at $104,770. The reason for the decline is likely due to widespread liquidations of long positions, which usually cause volatility. The total long and short liquidations in the last 25 hours amounted to $642.65 million . For Solana, this figure was at $23 million. In both cases, most of the liquidations came from long positions. This suggests that futures traders overestimated market performance up to this point. Liquidations, unstaking drives Solana down A spike in liquidations has a strong effect on volatility. Specifically, liquidations increase the supply of tokens in circulation, which can put downward pressure on their price. In this context, Solana’s pullback is aligned with the broader market trend. You might also like: Chainlink unveils new startup program ‘Build on Solana’ Still, many traders are anticipating the start of an altcoin season, which could benefit Solana. For instance, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes believes that the altcoin season may start when Bitcoin reaches $110,000. This will likely prompt many investors to convert their Bitcoin gains into even bigger potential gains with altcoins. At the same time, Solana is also seeing some positive signals. For instance, the recently approved 2X Solana ETF saw $30 million in inflows since its launch in February. This suggests that the likely approval of spot Solana ETFs in the U.S. has the potential to serve as a future price catalyst, especially as ETFs make it easier for some investors to gain exposure to crypto tokens.

MyStake – Overall Best UK Bitcoin Casino Pros: • Up to $1,000 crypto welcome package• Roughly 7,000 games• Fast payouts with crypto• Generous reload bonuses• Amazing mobile experience Cons: • Could use a better design• Customer support is a bit slow MyStake is easily one of the UK’s top contenders in the crypto casino arena. It manages to balance quality and quantity beautifully, thanks to a massive collection of games from some of the industry’s biggest providers — the top notch mobile support and friendly support don’t hurt, either. Variety of Games: 5/5 At the time of writing this, MyStake has over 7,000 different games. There are thousands of slots, table games, and live dealer options from 70+ software providers like Mancala, Playson, Booming Games, Yggdrasil, Habanero, Wzdan, and Microgaming. So, regardless of whether you want to try your luck with Aztec Magic Megaways or play it safe with classic blackjack, you’ll have no problem finding your perfect fit. However, our favourite part might be MyStake’s huge selection of arcade-style mini-games, exclusive crash gambling titles (we couldn’t get enough of Dino), and other instant-win options. Bonuses and Promotions: 4.8/5 We were truly impressed with the MyStake crypto welcome bonus. With a 170% match up to $1,000, you’ll definitely get started on the right foot. And most of the promotions here are similarly generous. From the 10% crypto cashback offers to the freebet bonuses available to sports bettors, MyStake goes out of its way to provide one of the most exciting promotions out there.

Navigation is clean, and there’s even a dark mode for more comfortable gaming at night. Customer Service: 4.9/5 MyStake’s live chat team is available 24/7, but they sometimes tend to be a bit slow. During our test run, we chatted with an agent in a bit over 10 minutes, and they handled even the most bone-headed crypto questions without making us feel bad about it. The brand is active on social media and frequently offers little giveaways and updates, in addition to responding to players fairly regularly. >> Get your $1,000 crypto welcome package at MyStake 2.

And that’s without touching on the 120+ jackpot slots. Honestly, if you’ve been trying to figure out where it pays to play, Rolletto might be your best bet based on payout potential alone. Bonuses and Promotions: 4.8/5 Rolletto offers new players a 150% welcome bonus with 50 bonus spins. And if that’s not enough for you, there are a host of other bonuses waiting, including up to 200 bonus spins every weekend, mini games bonuses, and many others.

Jackbit – Best Crypto UK Casino for Mobile Players Pros: • 100 bonus spins with no wagering requirements• Over 5,000 crypto casino games• Huge selection of table games• Amazing mobile experience• Broad crypto support Cons: • Could use more bonuses• Design is not the best Wrapping up our top five is Jackbit Casino, one of the best crypto gambling sites for mobile players. Variety of Games: 4.8/5 This is where Jackbit shines brightest. Whether you’re into blackjack, roulette, baccarat, or poker, the platform delivers dozens of unique table game variations, many offering flexible betting limits for casual and high-roller players alike. What really sets Jackbit apart is its video poker library – 70+ machines spanning all the classics like Jacks or Better, Deuces Wild, and Bonus Poker, with both single-hand and multi-hand options. Slots, live dealer games, and even crash-style crypto games are here too, but table and poker players will find the real value. Bonuses and Promotions: 4.75/5 Instead of your traditional matched deposit bonus, Jackbit offers 100 bonus spins on Book of Dead with no wagering requirements. This means anything you win with those extra spins is yours to keep. It’s a great way to kick things off, though some bonus hunters may be disappointed by the lack of a big BTC match. While ongoing promos are minimal, the low-key approach will appeal to purists who prefer playing without bonus restrictions. Payment Methods and Speed: 4.8/5 Jackbit supports all the major cryptos, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and more. Payouts are processed quickly, and we experienced near-instant crypto withdrawals during our tests. Minimum deposits are reasonable at around $50 (or crypto equivalent), and there are no fees tacked on by the casino. If you don’t already have your own crypto, you can buy it directly from the website. Mobile Optimisation and User Interface: 4.8/5 The platform is fully mobile-optimised and works smoothly on iOS and Android browsers – no app required. Game pages load quickly, and the layout makes it easy to browse by category or game type.

Freshbet – Fast Payout UK Crypto Casino Pros: • 155% match welcome bonus• Mobile-friendly website• 6,000+ casino games• Over 130 progressive and fixed jackpot games• Fast sign-up Cons: • Could use more reload bonuses• Customer support is a bit slow If you’re the sort of punter who stares longingly out at the crypto sea, waiting for your ship to come in, Freshbet might well be that vessel. With it’s impressive array of casino games and even better jackpot options (including some massive progressive and fixed jackpot payouts), it’s quite the catch. Variety of Games: 4.7/5 With over 6,000 games in its catalogue, Freshbet delivers one of the broadest selections on the UK casino scene. It’s jam-packed with slots, live dealer tables, crypto crash games, and a fairly decent number of more niche picks — but what made it stand out to the team was its jackpot selection. Freshbet features more than 130 jackpot games (132 to at the time of writing this, to be precise — though they’re adding new games all the time) including crypto payout giants like Force of Gods, Aztec Sun Hold and Win, and the appropriately named Extreme Pay. Whether you’re spinning for fun or chasing those high-stakes wins, your next big payout might be just around the corner. Bonuses and Promotions: 4.8/5 New players can lay claim to a generous 155% crypto match bonus when making their first Bitcoin deposit. This promotion is good for up to £500 in bonus cash with a very reasonable 40x rollover attached to it. The ongoing promotions are a little underwhelming and seem mostly focused on sports betting, however — though the loyalty bonus and VIP program provide pretty decent long-term value for players who stick around. Payment Methods and Speed: 4.65/5 Freshbest supports most of the major currencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Ripple, Tether, and Litecoin. Payouts are processed quickly, with many players reporting their winnings hitting their account within hours (or less, as was the case with our tests).

That said, the agents we chatted with were courteous and knowledgeable and were able to answer a slew of questions regarding crypto wallet compatibility and bonus eligibility. >> Claim your 155% crypto bonus at Freshbet 5. Goldenbe t – Best UK Bitcoin Casino for Table Games Pros: • 100% match on first three deposits• Massive library of table games• Live games from leading providers• Mobile-friendly website• Near-instant payouts Cons: • Limited reload bonus variety• Customer support is a bit slow Rounding out our top five is Goldenbet Casino. If you’re a Bitcoin bettor who is all about the felt — blackjack, roulette, and baccarat — and wants the full table game experience backed by the convenience of crypto — this is where you’ll want to place your chips. Variety of Games: 4.8/5 Goldenbet’s a dream come true for table game fans. It boasts dozens of table games. Single and multi-deck blackjack, American, European, and French roulette, VIP baccarat, War, Sicbo, poker… You name it, Goldenbet has got it. And from some of the industry’s top RNG table game providers like GameArt, Platypus, Habanero, BetSoft, and more. So whether you’re chasing down the perfect hand in blackjack or going all-in on some Casino Hold’em, there’s a table with your name on it. There are plenty of slots and instant win games, too, but Goldenbet’s clear focus on table games is what sets it apart from the UK’s other top crypto platforms. Bonuses and Promotions: 4.7/5 New players can access a 100% match bonus worth up to £500 on each of their first three deposits, making it easy for players to maximise their bonus potential without breaking the bank in one go. Similar to Freshbet, the reload bonus options are a bit slim, but you shouldn’t have too much trouble keeping your bankroll fat and festive. Payment Methods and Speed: 4.6/5 Players can load up their accounts with a wide array of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and Tether. Payments are processed swiftly, with most withdrawals reaching your wallet in under an hour. The site manages to do a good job of keeping the process user-friendly, too. Even if it’s your first time depositing with crypto, you shouldn’t have any issues. Mobile Optimisation and User Interface: 4.6/5 Mobile bettors will find a lot to love here. Goldenbet runs like a charm on iOS and Android, with smooth transitions between games and a clever layout that makes it easy to jump right into your favourite tables. Game previews, balance updates, and live casino interfaces are all well-optimised for smaller screens — and they look pretty good on large ones, too. Customer Service: 4.7/5 Customer support is available 24/7, but the response times vary depending on when you’re playing. In our case, we waited nearly 15 minutes to hear back from a rep, which is not ideal, but we were testing during late Saturday evening, so it was probably one of the busiest times during the week. But once connected, they were only too happy to walk us through the KYC checks and bonus terms, which made them worth the wait in our books. >> Snatch up your triple deposit bonus at Goldenbet How We Chose the Best Bitcoin Online Casinos in the UK Variety of Games The best Bitcoin casinos offer UK players the widest variety of online crypto casino games.

2025-05-19T16:22:37.000Z,"Crypto fund inflows hit $785 million as Ethereum recovers after Pectra upgrade","Crypto funds recorded $785 million in weekly inflows. This has brought the year-to-date totals to $7.5 billion and fully recovered from earlier outflows. Ethereum shows renewed interest with substantial inflows following the Pectra upgrade. However, Bitcoin still maintains dominance with $557 million in weekly inflows. US dominates regional inflows, while some markets see an exodus Regional investment patterns by global cryptocurrency markets are clearly split in the latest data. Substantial inflows in the past week of $680.6 million for the United States place it at the lead as the primary driver behind a mainly positive market flow. Germany took the second position that week, with inflows amounting to $86.3 million, while Hong Kong added a smaller increment of $24.2 million to the positive column. Source: CoinShares But a number of key markets were reversed. Sweden had a net outflow of $16.3 million, and Canada lost $13.5 million, with Brazil losing $3.9 million. Switzerland had modest inflows of $2.7 million, and Australia contributed $13.5 million to the positive side. The aggregate Assets Under Management (AUM) in all countries currently sits at $172.9 billion. The US continues to lead at $131.2 billion in AUM, followed by Canada at $6.2 billion, even after experiencing recent outflows. Germany has $6.0 billion, and Switzerland manages $6.0 billion in digital assets. Brazil, even with its negative weekly flow, still has $1.5 billion in AUM. Ethereum bounces back after Pectra upgrade Ethereum posted a strong rebound with $205 million in week-on-week inflows. This is a welcome switch that market observers attribute to the latest Pectra upgrade and change in Ethereum leadership. This inflow follows times of investor uncertainty. The inflow now totals its month-to-date inflows to $242 million and year-to-date total to $757 million. Ethereum’s overall AUM is now at $13.8 billion. Bitcoin still leads the field with inflows worth $557 million last week. This has pushed its month-to-date inflows to $2.5 billion and year-to-date inflows to $7.2 billion. Bitcoin’s dominance can also be noted in its gigantic $148 billion AUM. Other assets were quite different. XRP saw inflows worth $4.9 million, while Sui saw $9.3 million added to it. Solana and multi-asset products witnessed $0.89 million and $2.86 million outflows, respectively. Short positions in Bitcoin saw inflows of $5.85 million. This is indicative of investors hedging against the existing price levels of Bitcoin. Cardano and Chainlink registered modest inflows of $0.5 million and $0.2 million, respectively, with Litecoin reporting no movement for the week. Total weekly inflows across all digital assets amount to $785 million. This totals digital asset AUM at $172.9 billion. iShares leads provider inflows The digital asset provider sector shows iShares ETFs/USA dominating with $907.8 million in weekly inflows. Data shows that it has outpaced all other investment vehicles. This strong performance has pushed their month-to-date inflows to $2.98 billion and year-to-date to $9.04 billion. iShares currently manages $69.04 billion in digital assets. In stark contrast, several major providers faced withdrawals. Grayscale Investments LLC/USA saw outflows of $42.46 million for the week. This has contributed to a month-to-date outflow of $152.77 million and year-to-date outflows of $1.62 billion. Despite these losses, Grayscale still maintains $29.67 billion in AUM. Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin F experienced the largest weekly outflow at $122.07 million, with month-to-date losses of $30.12 million and year-to-date outflows of $117.44 million. Its AUM stands at $20.56 billion. ARK 21 Shares/USA saw a $68.91 million exit during the week. However, Bitwise Funds Trust and CoinShares XBT Provider AB recorded outflows of $15.9 million and $18.15 million respectively. ProShares ETFs/USA bucked the negative trend with modest inflows of $10.85 million. Other providers collectively contributed $134.78 million in inflows. The “Other” category manages $32.68 billion in total assets, highlighting the fragmented nature of the remaining market. The total weekly flow across all providers reached $785.22 million, with the industry’s total AUM at $172.89 billion.

As that happened, XRP is also drawing attention. There is growing legal optimism in the Ripple vs. SEC case. This situation is prompting discussion on whether XRP could reach $3.00 next, despite a slight pullback in its price to around $2.29, down 4.5% over the past 24 hours. According to CoinMarketCap data , XRP’s recent 24-hour high of $2.44 signals a resistance zone. The price also lost support from the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $2.33. Legal Optimism in Ripple vs. SEC Case Fuels XRP Sentiment Many crypto market participants appear fairly certain Judge Analisa Torres will rule in favor of Ripple.

2025-05-19T16:11:55.000Z,"Here’s What Can Trigger a Solana (SOL) Bull Run","TL;DR Analysts see potential for a new SOL rally in case the price reclaims certain resistance levels. One popular trader sold their “spot bag” and is now looking for re-entry options. The Necessary Condition Solana’s SOL has been in a downtrend in the past week and is far from its all-time high registered in January this year. As of this writing, it trades at around $161, representing a 45% decline from the historic peak. However, some analysts believe a renewed rally might be knocking on the door. The popular X user Ali Martinez claimed that a breakout above the resistance level of $176-$188 could ignite a fresh bull run. Earlier this month, he disclosed that the number of wallets holding at least 0.1 SOL has soared above 11 million in the span of just two weeks. This development indicates growing participation in the ecosystem, while the minor threshold hints that most newcomers are likely retail investors. Martinez isn’t the only renowned analyst to give his two cents on the topic. The X user Cas Abbe reminded about SOL’s crash in April, outlining that the price has climbed by over 50% since then, “while its fundamentals are getting better.” They think the ATH registered at the start of 2025 was not the cycle top for Solana, envisioning a new peak sometime this year. Mags chipped in, too, suggesting that SOL’s monthly chart “is forming a massive ascending triangle pattern.” That said, the analyst expects that a breakout beyond $267 could trigger “a massive leg up” to uncharted territory. The Next Buying Opportunity? Another X user who weighed in recently is XO. Earlier this month, they shared their trading history, which included a big sell-off approximately a week ago when the price was above $180. As it turned out, this was the trader’s entire “spot bag.” They now explore new buying opportunities that might occur in the next weeks or months. XO described the $140-$150 zone as an “immediate level of interest,” adding that $120 “isn’t out of the question.” Subsequently, the trader assumed that Solana’s future price dynamics may heavily depend on what bitcoin does next.

Among those that saw a decline were Strategy ( NASDAQ: MSTR ) where short interest declined to 12.63% from 13.41% in the previous month. MARA Holdings ( NASDAQ: MARA ), Riot Platforms ( NASDAQ: RIOT ), CleanSpark ( NASDAQ: CLSK ) and Bitfarms ( NASDAQ: BITF ) also saw short interest fall to 27.14%, 25.15%, 31.76% and 13.04% respectively. Core Scientific ( NASDAQ: CORZ ) saw the highest rise in short interest in April to 18.44% from 16.87% in March. HIVE Digital ( NASDAQ: HIVE ) and Coinbase ( NASDAQ: COIN ) also saw short interest increase to 7.1% and 4.92%. In April, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) rebounded to reclaim the $90,000 mark showing its resilience during a wobbly economic period triggered by tariff concerns. In March, the cryptocurrency had briefly fallen below the $75,000 mark. “Bitcoin has been trading more as a safe haven during the recent selloff as the US dollar depreciated,” said Seeking Alpha analyst Damir Tokic . In May so far, it has already climbed above the $100K mark. According to Standard Chartered , Bitcoin could reach new all-time highs of around $120K in Q2, don the back of a broad asset reallocation away from U.S. assets as well as several technical indicators.

Despite the recent 13.81% dip, bullish momentum remains intact as price approaches a key support confluence. Moo Deng ( MOODENG ) has seen a sharp but expected correction after a strong weekend rally that pushed price into resistance. This pullback is not a sign of weakness but rather a natural breather in what continues to be a bullish trend. As price retraces, attention now turns to a key technical zone that could offer the perfect setup for the next leg higher. Key technical points Current Correction: Moo Deng has pulled back 13.81% from the local high after hitting resistance at the 0.618 Fibonacci. Support Zone: Price is approaching a confluence of key levels: the 0.618 Fibonacci, 200 MA, and high time frame range support. Bullish Setup: A bounce from this area would likely form a higher low in the current uptrend and could trigger a move back to $0.31 and potentially $0.35. MooDeng USDT (1H) Chart, Source: TradingView After rallying aggressively from weekend lows, Moo Deng faced technical resistance at a key Fibonacci level, which halted the bullish momentum and triggered a corrective phase. This move, however, fits the structure of a bullish trend, where pullbacks are expected and even healthy to sustain long-term gains. A drop of nearly 14% might seem concerning on the surface, but the underlying structure remains constructive. The current retracement is bringing Moo Deng into a support-rich zone. The 0.618 Fibonacci level is overlapping with the 200-day moving average, a historically strong area where buyers often step in. Additionally, this zone sits within a broader trading range between key support and resistance on the higher time frames, increasing the chances of a strong reaction. You might also like: Crypto bull run intact despite weekend volatility in Bitcoin If Moo Deng holds this level and forms a higher low, it will confirm continued strength in the existing bullish market structure. Such a move would establish a deviation beneath resistance and offer technical confirmation that the correction is ending, with price gearing up for another push higher. What to expect in the coming price action If support holds and a higher low forms, Moo Deng is likely to resume its uptrend and retest previous resistance levels at $0.31 and $0.35. The bullish structure remains valid, and continuation to the upside could unfold quickly once momentum returns.

2025-05-19T16:05:43.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Rallies Then Drops, Risks $100,000 Breakdown","Bitcoin (BTC) registered a sharp increase on Sunday, rising over 3% to cross $106,000 and settle at $106,479. However, its struggles at higher levels continued as it lost momentum after reaching this level and declined substantially during the ongoing session. The flagship cryptocurrency is down nearly 2% over the past 24 hours, trading around the $103,000 mark. Strategy Acquires 7,390 BTC, Reveals Class-Action Lawsuit Michael Saylor’s Strategy completed the acquisition of 7,390 Bitcoin last week for nearly $765 million. According to the announcement, the company purchased the Bitcoin for $764.9 million at an average price of just under $103,500 per coin. Strategy also reported a Bitcoin yield of 16.3% year-to-date. Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor had hinted at the purchase in a cryptic post on May 18. The company’s May 19 filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also revealed it was the subject of a class-action lawsuit. The lawsuit accuses Strategy officials of misrepresenting the nature of their Bitcoin investments. 0xngmi, a pseudo-anonymous developer at DefiLlama, stated, “The lawsuit seems to be people complaining that Microstrategy understated how much money it could lose if BTC went down, but if you're buying a company that is self-labeled as leverage on Bitcoin, what do you expect? It's pretty clear what will happen if BTC goes down.” The lawsuit accuses Strategy officials of violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. “The [suit claims] that the named defendants made false and/or misleading statements with respect to and/or failed to disclose information with respect to the anticipated profitability of our Bitcoin-focused investment strategy and treasury operations, and the various risks associated with bitcoin’s volatility.” Strategy holds 576,230 BTC as of May 18, acquired for around $40.2 billion at an average price of $69,726 per coin. The firm’s total Bitcoin holdings are valued at nearly $60 billion at current prices. Bitcoin Risks $100,000 Breakdown Bitcoin has registered one of its largest daily declines during the ongoing session, with the price down over 3%. The price fell to a low of $102,145 before rebounding to reclaim $103,000. The marketwide decline was prompted by Moody’s downgrade of the US credit rating thanks to a growing budget deficit and the absence of a credible fiscal consolidation plan. Analysts believe the flagship cryptocurrency’s decline may confirm a bearish divergence and raise the prospect of a breakdown below $100,000. BTC jumped to a local high of $107,111 during the ongoing session but rapidly declined, with its RSI printing a lower high and hinting at a classic bearish divergence. Analysts from Swissblocks noted that Bitcoin grabbed liquidity around the $104,000-$106,000 levels but failed to sustain momentum. As a result, it faced another rejection at higher levels, putting its immediate support levels at $100,000 and $97,000 under pressure. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has exhibited cautious optimism over the past two sessions, rising over 3% on Sunday and crossing $107,000 during the ongoing session. However, it failed to maintain its position above this level and plunged below $104,000. Analysts believe BTC must consolidate above $103,000 before it can breach the wall of resistance above $105,000-$106,000. Additionally, its performance also depends on US stock indices. A pullback in US markets could delay BTC’s recovery. Vikram Subburaj, CEO of Giottus Crypto Platform, stated, “If Bitcoin decisively breaks $107,000, aided by strong ETF inflows, it would lead to new highs for Bitcoin, with strong rallies expected among altcoins. Until then, traders are advised to minimize their losses and be ready to deploy cash in case of a breakout.” According to analysts, two factors were behind BTC’s jump on Sunday. The first is a proposal by President Trump to levy a 5% tax on remittances sent by individuals to their home countries. The proposal impacts 40 million people who wire a part of their income to their families living abroad. Analysts have warned that such a move could drive people to unofficial channels, including crypto. Another reason is an upcoming bill that proposes stablecoin regulation, set to be taken up by Congress this week. Republican Senator Bill Hagerty stated, “Next week, the Senate will make history when we debate and pass the Genius Act that establishes the first-ever pro-growth regulatory framework for payment stablecoins.” The sudden increase saw over $460 million in long positions wiped out. Economists have stated that BTC’s current price levels are due to growing institutional interest and sustained inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs. Analysts believe the current price levels are sustained by strong inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, which registered $2.8 billion in net inflows in May, taking the total value past $122 billion. Singapore-based QCP Capital stated in a note to investors, “Looking ahead, we believe there is further room for digital assets to rally, especially as Coinbase’s inclusion into the S&P 500 on May 19 draws closer. History tells us that index inclusion tends to act as a short-term catalyst, as passive managers adjust their allocations to track the benchmark more closely.” BTC registered a substantial increase on Thursday (May 8), rising over 6% to cross $100,000 and settle at $103,093. The rally lost momentum on Friday as the price registered a marginal decline and settled at $102,851. Buyers returned to the market on Saturday as BTC rose nearly 2% and settled at $104,617. Despite a positive Saturday, the flagship cryptocurrency was back in the red on Sunday, dropping nearly 1% and settling at $103,802. BTC encountered volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Sellers ultimately gained the upper hand as BTC dropped 1.04% and settled at $102,728. Source: TradingView BTC rebounded on Tuesday, rising 1.36% to $104,123, but fell back on Wednesday, registering a marginal decline and settling at $103,568. The price fell to an intraday low of $101,459 on Thursday but rebounded from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $103,816. Price action turned bearish on Friday and Saturday as BTC registered marginal declines and settled at $103,235. Bullish sentiment returned on Sunday as the price rallied over 3% to cross $103,000 and settle at $106,479. The current session sees BTC down nearly 3%, recovering from a low of $102,145 to trade around $104,300. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-05-19T16:05:40.000Z,"YouTube Axes Roxom TV, Sparking Fresh Fears of Bitcoin Content Crackdown","2,000 subscribers vanished in a click when YouTube abruptly removed Bitcoin broadcaster Roxom TV from its platform on May 14. Roxom TV is a relatively new media platform that focuses on Bitcoin ( BTC ) news, culture, and education. It was founded by crypto entrepreneurs ​​Borja and Helena Martel Seward in November 2024 and established its presence on YouTube shortly after. Still no ETA. Still no human review of our account. It’s been two days. @YouTube removed our channel with zero strikes and no explanation. We stream Bitcoin educational content 24/7. That’s the “dangerous content.” Catch us on @rumblevideo . @chrispavlovski https://t.co/AFxrhOUJ6c — Roxom TV (@RoxomTV) May 16, 2025 Roxom TV Speaks Out About YouTube Ban Alex McShane, director of Bitcoin strategy at Roxom TV, told Cryptonews that no clear explanation was given as to why the channel was removed by YouTube. “Our transcripts from recent shows we’ve published don’t align with the reasons listed in the emails sent to us by YouTube,” McShane said. According to the email from YouTube, Roxom TV violated YouTube’s “harmful and dangerous content” policy. Source: Roxom TV After appealing the decision, Roxom TV received another email from YouTube that stated the channel continues to violate policy and will not be put back on the platform. With little communication from YouTube, McShane explained that he can only guess the ban was automatically issued by a bot that mistakenly viewed the channel as promoting cryptocurrency projects . “I think this was an automatic ban triggered by bot moderation, not understanding satire or mistaking our coverage of crypto scams and hacks as promoting them somehow, but it’s really hard to say,” he said. McShane added that Roxom TV streamed live content on YouTube most of the time, which could have made the algorithm more sensitive, particularly to Roxom’s live political coverage featuring Bitcoin. While Roxom TV’s YouTube channel remains banned, McShane is confident it will be placed back on the platform. “But we need a manual human appeal review; so far we’ve only had bots reviewing our appeal, which was auto denied,” he remarked. YouTube Cracks Down on Gambling Content: Does Crypto Qualify? While Roxom TV is the most recent Bitcoin-focused channel to be removed from YouTube, the platform underwent a “crypto-purge” in December 2019. Sources note that at least 35 crypto-focused channels were impacted during the purge, including popular shows like Bad Crypto Podcast and Altcoin Daily . Additional channels from major media outlets Bankless and Cointelegraph were also removed around this time, but have since been put back on YouTube. The Bankless @YouTube account 'has been terminated' No warning. No notification. No justification 150,000 subs 10,000+ hours of content Hey @YouTube , our community would like a word! RETWEET to let YouTube hear you: It’s not okay to ban crypto content pic.twitter.com/MJQ4MGwtYD — Bankless (@BanklessHQ) May 8, 2022 A CNBC TV18 article states that channels were removed for violating community guidelines, but that the removal of the content was actually due to machine learning algorithms. While this likely was the case in December 2019, YouTube has recently taken steps to crack down on gambling-related content . On March 4, YouTube sent out a public statement warning against promoting gambling sites or related content. YouTube also made it clear that it may take down videos that “promise guaranteed returns.” McShane was made aware of this statement and noted that YouTube’s message to Roxom TV made no mention of violating these terms specifically. YouTube Algorithm Triggers However, YouTube’s algorithm may be unable to detect the differences between crypto and gambling content . This may also be due to certain words or instances that can trigger these algorithms. Nikki Martinez, head of short form video content at Hype, told Cryptonews that she has seen creators’ content get flagged or shadowbanned for using certain trigger words or phrases. Martinez currently works with a global network of creators at Hype to produce content for crypto clients at scale. “One time, I was even shadowbanned on social media platform TikTok for talking about why one of my accounts was banned,” Martinez stated. Martinez added that TikTok’s moderation system can flag videos that sound like “guaranteed income,” “easy money,” “instant payout,” or even token names. She noted that the platform will automatically label these videos as scams or misleading financial advice. “The moderation is largely automated and tends to overcorrect, removing or limiting content based on certain keywords or context,” she pointed out. “Even links can be flagged as suspicious, especially when posted by new accounts.” Martinez also explained that most video platforms, like YouTube, don’t want creators driving users off the platform, especially when it comes to financial products. Fortunately, both TikTok and YouTube offer users an option to appeal. “I’ve seen creators successfully appeal takedowns and go on to reach 1M+ views after their content was reinstated,” Martinez said. “But these bans are becoming more common as TikTok, YouTube, and Meta face increasing pressure to regulate financial content globally, especially in industries like crypto that are still unregulated in many regions.” Tips For Crypto Creators Using Centralized Social Media Platforms Given recent crackdowns on crypto-related content , McShane noted it’s important for Web3 creators to support decentralized protocols like Nostr or Calaxy where content cannot be censored. Yet given the reach of YouTube and TikTok, many content creators may want to continue using these platforms. In this case, Martinez suggests that creators sharing crypto content be mindful of financial language. “Success on TikTok often comes down to how you say something. Subtle narratives like ‘side hustles,’ ‘digital income,’ or phrasing like ‘withdraw once approved’ (instead of ‘instant payout’) tend to perform better and avoid violations,” she remarked. Martinez further pointed out that some centralized social media platforms are more crypto-friendly than others. “X (Twitter) is by far the most open and effective for crypto content. But if you’re posting about unregulated industries on Instagram, TikTok or YouTube, it’s essential to build a presence elsewhere too – email lists, gated communities, or Telegram/Discord. You never want to be dependent on one platform,” she said.“ Martinez believes that content creators who will win long term are the ones who can tell crypto stories in a way that feels accessible, culturally relevant, and algorithm safe. Wendy O—a popular crypto-content creator with about 2050 subscribers on YouTube—told Cryptonews that her channel has never been banned by YouTube. Her advice to other creators is “to read the centralized platform’s policy, disclose and be cautious on verbiage.” The post YouTube Axes Roxom TV, Sparking Fresh Fears of Bitcoin Content Crackdown appeared first on Cryptonews .",cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/youtube-axes-roxom-tv-bitcoin-crackdown/,"ALTCOIN|BTC","Bitcoin News|News|Bitcoin|Decentralization|Social media",cryptocompare

Traders split over BTC price at $105K","Key points: BTC price action retargets $105,000 after the Wall Street open, rising 2.5% from the day’s lows. Volatility continues, leading market participants to varying conclusions over what will happen to BTC/USD next. Perspectives include the Bitcoin bull market being in its final stages.

Now, opinions differed about when, or if, new all-time highs would come. “This is exactly what Bitcoin needs to be doing,” an optimistic Rekt Capital wrote in part of his latest X analysis. “Needs to hold ~$104400 as support to position itself for a successful post-breakout retest.” BTC/USD 1-week chart.

2025-05-19T16:04:07.000Z,"Russia to Bring New Regulations on May 26: Giant Altcoin Could Be Banned!","Russia, which faced major sanctions after the invasion of Ukraine, turned to Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies to overcome these sanctions. At this point, Russia is tightening its control over the crypto sector, even as it begins to use Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in international payments. According to Bloomberg, the Central Bank of Russia’s digital asset regulations, which are expected to come into effect next week, May 26, are expected to seriously affect Tether (USDT) trading within the country and impose restrictions on USDT access. The new digital asset regulations reportedly include: “a ban on digital assets issued by unfriendly countries, only allowing digital assets from friendly countries, and a ban on tokens that can be blocked or taken by issuers or payment agents.” At this point, it is thought that Russian companies can continue to use stablecoins such as USDT for cross-border payments, but the use of USDT in local payments is too risky and restrictions may be imposed. Experts even state that the use of USDT may be banned in Russia due to new regulations. “Tether may be banned for use within Russia, as it does not meet the requirements of Russia's new digital asset regulations. However, stablecoins are not prohibited for use in international payments,” said Mikhail Uspensky, a member of the Russian Virtual Asset Regulatory Committee. *This is not investment advice.

The flagship cryptocurrency held above $103,000 for most of the weekend before moving late on Sunday/early Monday, rising to an intraday high of $106,847 before registering a steep decline and falling below $104,000. BTC is marginally down over the past 24 hours, trading at $103,296. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) extended its losses over the weekend and has dropped nearly 4% over the past 24 hours, slipping below $2,400 to $2,394. Ripple (XRP) is down almost 1%, while Solana (SOL) is down 1.28%, trading around $165. Dogecoin (DOGE) has bucked the bearish trend, up nearly 2%. However, Cardano (ADA) , Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR) , Toncoin (TON) , Polkadot (DOT) , and Litecoin (LTC) traded firmly in bearish territory. Australian Authorities Seize Bitcoin, Mansion Linked To Exchange Hack Authorities in Australia have seized Bitcoin, a waterfront mansion, and a Mercedes Benz car allegedly linked to a crypto exchange hack. The AFP-led Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce (CACT) issued a statement on May 18 saying it had seized nearly 25 BTC along with the mansion and the car. The total worth of the seizure was 4.5 million Australian Dollars ($2.88 million). The AFP began its investigation into the assets in September after law enforcement agencies in Luxembourg shared details about suspicious Bitcoin transactions. Luxembourg authorities said the transactions were linked to a Queensland individual previously convicted of hacking a US gaming company. The AFP stated their investigation also tied the individual to the theft of 950 BTC from a French crypto exchange in 2013. However, no criminal charges were brought over the theft of Bitcoin. According to local agencies, the owner of the assets is Shane Stephen Duffy, who pleaded guilty to fraud and computer hacking in 2016 and selling data of League of Legends players. However, prosecutors did not convict Duffy of the attack, stating he received a copy of the data online and sold it for profit. Duffy was also accused of hacking the X account of Riot Games President Marc Merrill to publicize his data-selling business. AFP Commander Jason Kennedy stated, “The profits derived from criminal activities are also often used to fund further criminal acts, which is why the AFP works closely with our partners in the CACT to target the proceeds of crime and ensure they are reinvested in the community.” Crypto Firms In The UK Must Report Customer Transactions Crypto companies operating in the UK must collect and report data from every trade and transfer beginning January 2026 as part of an effort to improve tax reporting. According to a UK Revenue and Customs Department statement, crypto firms must collect the user’s full name, home address, and tax identification number for every transaction, including the cryptocurrency used and the amount moved. The statement added that failure to comply with the directive will incur penalties of up to 300 British pounds per user. The department stated it would inform companies on how to comply with the incoming guidelines. The new rules are part of the UK’s integration of the Organization for Economic Development’s Crypto Asset Reporting Framework, designed to improve transparency and efficiency in crypto tax reporting. The changes reflect the government’s aim to establish a robust regulatory environment supporting growth while ensuring consumer protection. The UK’s move to integrate crypto rules into its existing financial framework is in stark contrast with the EU’s approach. The EU introduced the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation framework last year. VCs View Stablecoins Positively The latest Pitchbook report on crypto VC trends has revealed their overwhelmingly positive views on stablecoins. The report stated, “Dollar-denominated settlement remains crypto’s killer application, insulated—at least partially—from broader risk-off moves. Our expectations remain that VC investments in the near term could see a step-up increase, especially in payment, remittance, and treasury-management startups that directly monetize stablecoin velocity.” However, the report stated that VCs will commit more to the crypto industry only if it works to address growing security concerns. These concerns were amplified by the recent Bybit hack. The report also predicted that institutional investors would begin demanding real-time proof of real-time proof-of-reserve tooling and middleware that “abstracts” away key-management complexity. The report also highlighted a decline in retail speculation, leading to a substantial loss in meme coin volumes, especially on Solana. The drop in retail interest has led to a significant drop in investment in prominent meme coins. The report added that Circle’s upcoming IPO could create significant crypto liquidity and potentially validate the stablecoin model. “Taken together, Q1 2025 was a quarter of consolidation rather than capitulation. Market beta turned negative, but venture-relevant signals—stablecoin growth, infrastructure de-risking, and a credible IPO pipeline—remain intact.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin’s (BTC) weekend calm was broken on Sunday when the flagship cryptocurrency unexpectedly jumped over 3%, catching the markets off guard. However, what followed next was even stranger, as the price dropped back, falling to a low of $102,145 before moving to its current levels above $103,000. The sudden increase saw over $460 million in long positions wiped out. The price jump took BTC just shy of its all-time high before it fell back to current levels. Economists have stated that BTC’s current price levels are due to growing institutional interest and sustained inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs. Analysts believe the current price levels are sustained by strong inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, which registered $2.8 billion in net inflows in May, taking the total value past $122 billion. Singapore-based QCP Capital stated in a note to investors, “Looking ahead, we believe there is further room for digital assets to rally, especially as Coinbase’s inclusion into the S&P 500 on May 19 draws closer. History tells us that index inclusion tends to act as a short-term catalyst, as passive managers adjust their allocations to track the benchmark more closely.” A positive economic outlook has also helped BTC maintain its current price levels. The Federal Reserve has kept its benchmark interest rates unchanged at 4.25% to 4.50%, maintaining a cautious stance. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said that the Fed is prepared to respond to evolving data but has offered no imminent shift in policy due to inflation concerns. BTC’s price action has been subdued after its May 8 rally, when it surged past $100,000 and settled at $103,093. The rally lost momentum on Friday, registering a marginal decline, slipping below $103,000 and settling at $102,851. The price recovered on Saturday, rising 1.72% and settling at $103,617. However, it was back in the red on Sunday, dropping nearly 1% and ending the weekend on a bearish note at $103,802. BTC encountered volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Sellers ultimately gained the upper hand as BTC dropped 1.04% and settled at $102,728. Source: TradingView The price rebounded on Tuesday, rising 1.36% to reclaim $104,000 and settle at $104,123, but was back in the red on Wednesday, falling 0.53% to $103,568. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $101,459 on Thursday but rebounded to register a marginal increase and settle at $103,816. However, sellers were back in control on Friday as BTC registered a marginal decline to $103,545. Price action remained muted on Saturday as BTC registered another marginal decline and settled at $103,235. Price action turned bullish on Sunday as BTC rallied over 3% to cross $106,000 and settle at $106,479. However, the flagship cryptocurrency has lost momentum during the ongoing session and is down nearly 3%, having slipped below $105,000 and trading around $103,275. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) continued its downward trajectory, starting the new week in the red after experiencing volatility on Sunday. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency lost momentum after failing to move past the 200-day SMA on Tuesday (May 13) and has continued to trade downwards as buyers struggled to reclaim momentum. ETH must reclaim and close above $2,450 to prevent a decline to $2,000. Additionally, if the price fails to clear the $2,500 mark, it could indicate a fresh decline, with sellers already gaining the upper hand. However, if buyers regain momentum and break above $2,500, ETH could push towards $3,000. ETH registered a stunning rally on Thursday, rising nearly 22%, surging past $2,000 and settling at $2,206. The price raced to an intraday high of $2,489 on Friday but failed to stay at that level, ultimately settling at $2,345. Bullish sentiment intensified on Saturday as ETH rose over 10%, crossing $2,500 and settling at $2,585. Despite the positive sentiment, ETH lost momentum on Sunday, dropping to a low of $2,437 before settling at $2,514, ultimately registering a decline of $2,514. ETH encountered volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Sellers gained the upper hand as the price registered a marginal decline, slipping below $2,500 and settling at $2,496. Source: TradingView Despite the volatile start to the week, ETH rebounded on Tuesday, rising over 7%, surging past $2,600 and settling at $2,691. ETH could not push higher as selling pressure overwhelmed buyers. As a result, ETH dropped nearly 3% on Wednesday and settled at $2,610. Sellers retained control on Thursday as the price fell 2.38%, slipping below $2,600 and settling at $2,548. ETH rose to an intraday high of $2,648 on Friday as buyers attempted to regain control. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and fell to $2,537 after a marginal decline. The price continued to drop on Saturday, dropping 2.44%, slipping below the key $2,500 level and settling at $2,475. ETH encountered volatility on Sunday, plunging to an intraday low of $2,326 and rising to an intraday high of $2,586 before ultimately registering a marginal increase and settling at $2,498. The current session sees ETH down nearly 4% as sellers look to drive ETH toward $2,200. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) has dipped back into the red during the ongoing session after ending the weekend with an increase of nearly 5%. Analysts believe SOL is showing early signs of a breakdown after dipping below $165 during the ongoing session. SOL was rejected from the $180-$185 levels on May 14, declining nearly 10% until Saturday. However, it rebounded after finding support around $160 and the 200-day EMA. If SOL continues its decline and slips below $150, the price could see a retest of the support around $145 and the 50-day SMA.

2025-05-19T15:56:47.000Z,"BTC Price Rollercoaster Opens the Door for Altcoin Buyers – Why Gala and JasmyCoin Might Be the Right Pick","Bitcoin's volatile price swings have created opportunities in the altcoin market. Amidst this fluctuation, certain lesser-known coins are catching investors' eyes. This article explores why Gala and JasmyCoin are generating buzz and could be poised for significant growth. Is this the right time to consider these emerging contenders? Discover the potential and the reasons behind their rising appeal. GALA: A Surging Month and 6-Month Dip with Defined Price Levels Last month, GALA recorded a robust gain of about 38.67% while the six-month performance slipped nearly 32.48%. The numbers reveal a volatile backdrop where short-term strength contrasts with longer-term weakness. Price movements over these periods highlighted rapid shifts in market mood with clear rallies followed by significant declines, reflecting mixed investor sentiment. Currently, the coin trades between $0.0125 and $0.0202, with near-term resistance at $0.0235 and support at $0.0079. Secondary levels are set at $0.0312 and $0.000211. The slightly elevated RSI near 57 suggests neutrality, yet a one-week drop of 9% indicates some bearish pressure. Traders might consider entering near support and aiming exits close to resistance, balancing short-term caution with potential for a rebound. JasmyCoin: Recent Surge Over a 6-Month Dip JasmyCoin experienced a notable 27.66% monthly gain contrasting a 16.99% decline over the past six months. A short-term pullback of 7.80% in the last week reflects recent volatility. Price action has shown rapid shifts, highlighting aggressive upward movement in the short term while enduring a longer period of softness. The coin’s overall momentum remains mixed, illustrating a dynamic performance pattern. The current price is trading between approximately $0.0099 and $0.0216. Immediate resistance lies around $0.02666, with a second barrier near $0.03840. Support is solid at roughly $0.00318. No clear trend is present, as bulls and bears remain in contention. Traders might consider trading breakouts or reversals near these levels, staying alert to shifts in momentum. Conclusion BTC's fluctuating price offers an interesting chance for those considering alternative coins. Both GALA and JASMY present potential opportunities in this space. GALA stands out with its focus on the gaming market, attracting gamers and developers alike. JASMY emphasizes data management and offers a unique proposition for securely handling information.

The price of Oasis ( ROSE ) declined over 9% in the past 24 hours, trading at lows of $0.0314 as the broader crypto market turned negative.

2025-05-19T15:46:27.000Z,"Crypto languished in ‘SEC limbo’ for years: Paul Atkins reaffirms crypto commitments","SEC Chairman Paul Atkins issued a sharp critique of the agency’s past crypto strategy, calling it ineffective and damaging to market trust. In a speech published on the SEC’s website, Atkins said the Commission’s previous posture—initially ignoring crypto and then relying heavily on enforcement—had failed to provide clarity and discouraged engagement from legitimate players. “It seemed like a catch-22,” Atkins said. “The message was, ‘You go figure it out.’ That environment did not create trust.” To rebuild that trust, Atkins directed the Division of Corporation Finance to engage more transparently with market participants. He emphasized that while formal crypto rulemaking is underway, interim staff guidance will continue helping firms navigate regulatory uncertainties. You might also like: DigiAsia’s stock soars on plan to allocate 50% of profits to Bitcoin SEC and their FinHub Atkins also proposed formally integrating FinHub, the SEC’s Strategic Hub for Innovation and Financial Technology, into the agency’s core operations. Once viewed as an enforcement channel, FinHub will now focus on fostering innovation and adapting rules to evolving technology. In a notable policy shift, Atkins said he supports allowing registered firms to custody and trade both securities and non-securities within a single entity. He called it an “initial step” toward a “super-app” ecosystem, where investors can access both traditional and digital financial products in one place. The speech signals a strategic pivot for the SEC, as it looks to bring clarity and consistency to crypto regulation without stifling innovation. Still, Atkins noted the agency must remain within its statutory boundaries while using its discretion to modernize oversight. “I believe we can foster innovation while remaining true to our mission,” he said.

Of course, it’s important to weigh up the pros and cons of KYC before you decide to sign up for an online casino that requires it, or one that allows you to sidestep it. The Purpose of KYC Policies What’s the point of KYC policies in the first place? They do serve a purpose. Here are the main reasons behind them. • Preventing Financial Crime: KYC helps traditional casinos detect and deter money laundering and other illicit financial activity by verifying user identities.• Ensuring Age Restrictions: These checks confirm that users meet the legal gambling age required in their country, adding a layer of protection for vulnerable individuals.• Monitoring Transactions: Linking payments to verified identities can make it easier to identify unusual or fraudulent activity.• Meeting Legal Requirements: Most licensed traditional online casinos are required by regulators to implement KYC as part of standard compliance procedures. Benefits of No KYC Casinos When it comes to crypto casinos, no KYC is commonplace. Here are some of the main perks you’ll get. • Faster Sign-Up: You can jump straight into the action without submitting documents or waiting for verification – just connect your wallet and play.• Greater Privacy: No KYC means you don’t need to share personal information, which appeals to players who value anonymity and data security.• Quicker Withdrawals: Without identity checks, many no KYC crypto casino sites offer near-instant withdrawals, especially when using cryptocurrencies.• Global Accessibility: Players from regions with strict gambling laws can often access no KYC platforms without restrictions tied to traditional banking.• Less Risk of Data Breaches: With fewer personal details stored, there’s a reduced risk of your information being compromised in a security incident.

This has heightened macroeconomic uncertainty, contributing to a decline in Bitcoin’s price on May 19. This downgrade and fears of inflation spurred by potential tariff policies under President Donald Trump have rattled financial markets, increasing Treasury yields and triggering risk-off sentiment. “The 30Y Note Yield is above 5.00% and the 10Y Note Yield is up another +11 bps,” said capital markets commentator The Kobeissi Letter in a May 19 post on X, adding: “If the Trump Administration does not intervene here, 8% mortgages are coming.” Increasing US Treasury Bills.

(NASDAQ: MSTR) has deepened its already commanding position in the Bitcoin market, acquiring an additional 7,390 BTC for $764.9 million during the week of May 12–18. The company disclosed that the average purchase price was $103,498 per bitcoin, a major jump from its historical average cost basis. This latest acquisition comes just a week after Strategy purchased 13,390 BTC for $1.34 billion. The firm remains committed to its Bitcoin-centric treasury strategy. Strategy Now Holds 576,230 BTC in Total As of May 18, 2025, Strategy now holds 576,230 BTC, acquired for a total of $40.18 billion at an average price of $69,726 per bitcoin.

Saylor’s Bitcoin Bet Could Make Strategy the Top Public Stock A recent Financial Times documentary, Michael Saylor’s $40 Billion Bitcoin Bet, explores the bold vision behind Strategy’s approach. In the film, Jeff Walton, an analyst at Strategy, claims the company could eventually become the top publicly traded firm in the world, propelled by its singular focus on Bitcoin. “Strategy holds more of the best asset and most pristine collateral on the planet than any other company, by multiples,” Walton said. He argues that the firm’s massive exposure to Bitcoin—viewed by many as digital gold—gives it an unmatched strategic edge in a volatile macroeconomic environment. Bitcoin has rallied steadily in 2025, attracting renewed interest from institutional investors amid ongoing inflation concerns and geopolitical instability. Strategy’s aggressive buying spree suggests high confidence in the long-term value proposition of Bitcoin. As Bitcoin continues to break new ground, Strategy’s bet may turn into one of the most successful financial plays in corporate history—or one of the riskiest. Either way, Michael Saylor and his team have made it clear: they’re not just in it to win—they’re in it to redefine the game. Bitcoin Price Action Bitcoin has surged past the $106,800 mark, gaining an impressive $12,000 in May alone and notching up six consecutive weeks of growth. This upward momentum has revived the market, raising questions about whether the cryptocurrency is now on track to hit a new all-time high. Despite a brief pullback, BTC is consolidating within a tight range, with strong support at $102,000 and resistance at $106,000—indicating a market gearing up for its next big move. Arthur Azizov, founder and investor at B2 Ventures, believes this breakout reflects not just bullish enthusiasm but a maturing market underpinned by increasing institutional interest. “The return of the Coinbase premium is a key sign of renewed U.S. demand,” he notes, adding that if buyers can push through the current range, Bitcoin could break $108,000 and even test $110,000. That level would likely act as a strong psychological resistance, which could be overcome if momentum continues building at this pace. Technical indicators are aligning with the bullish narrative. Moving averages (EMA and SMA across 10, 20, 30, and 50-day periods) and the MACD (12, 26) support a continued upward trajectory. Azizov emphasizes that macro fundamentals are also favorable: last year’s halving has restricted supply, while ETF inflows are outpacing mining output. With fewer Bitcoin sitting on exchanges, supply pressure remains low. “The flat now is definitely not the top,” Azizov says. “It’s a pause before a surge—unless something unexpected knocks the market off course.” The post Strategy Bets $764.9M on 7,390 BTC, Doubling Down on Corporate Crypto Crown appeared first on Cryptonews .",cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/strategy-7390-btc-purchase-top-corporate-holder/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin News|News|Bitcoin|Michael Saylor|Strategy",cryptocompare

As of press time, SHIB was valued at $0.000014, down 5% in the last 24 hours, with weekly losses of over 12%. SHIB one-week price chart. Source: Finbold The coin’s 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) stands at $0.00001332, slightly below the current price, suggesting a mild upward trend in the recent past. Meanwhile, the 200-day SMA at $0.00001657 indicates SHIB is trading below its longer-term average, hinting at a broader downtrend. On the other hand, SHIB’s 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) is at 54.24, placing the meme coin in neutral territory, neither overbought nor oversold, implying balanced momentum. AI predicts SHIB price Finbold consulted OpenAI’s ChatGPT and xAI’s Grok for the price prediction, which offered various scenarios for SHIB on June 1. ChatGPT stated that SHIB will likely trade in a relatively stable range over the coming weeks. The model outlined a base-case scenario where SHIB fluctuates between $0.00001350 and $0.00001500. This assumes that Bitcoin consolidates near current levels and that no major news events significantly impact market sentiment. The OpenAI tool cited neutral readings on technical indicators such as RSI and MACD to support this sideways movement. However, ChatGPT also sees a bullish path for SHIB if it breaks resistance around $0.0000152 and broader market momentum returns, potentially pushing the token to the $0.00001650 and $0.00001800 range. On the downside, the model warned that a Bitcoin correction or fading interest in meme coins could send SHIB back to the $0.00001200 and $0.00001300 range, especially if community engagement weakens or bearish technical signals emerge. SHIB price prediction. Source: ChatGPT Grok’s SHIB price outlook Away from ChatGPT, Grok offered a three-tier forecast and placed more emphasis on external catalysts. In its bullish scenario, SHIB could reach $0.000020 and $0.000025, driven by strong Shibarium adoption, aggressive token burns, and a broader crypto market rally. However, Grok assigned just a 20–25% chance to a bullish breakout, instead favoring a more likely scenario where SHIB trades between $0.000013 and $0.000016, closely aligning with ChatGPT’s neutral outlook. This projection reflects steady community support, a stable Bitcoin market, and gradual progress in the Shiba Inu ecosystem, particularly through Shibarium. In a bearish case, Grok sees SHIB dropping to the $0.000010 and $0.000012 range, citing risks such as rising interest rates, regulatory pressure, underwhelming Shibarium performance, or a technical breakdown triggering stop-loss orders and panic selling. Both AIs emphasized that SHIB’s near-term direction depends as much on market sentiment as on technicals, with news, influencer buzz, and crypto trends often outweighing fundamentals.

2025-05-19T15:33:04.000Z,"Crypto Markets are Plunging Hard—Is This the Best Buying Opportunity?","The post Crypto Markets are Plunging Hard—Is This the Best Buying Opportunity? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto markets faced a huge bearish action throughout the past week, while the bullish push during the weekend revived the possibility of a healthy recovery. No sooner had the BTC price erased all the gains incurred during the last trading day than the markets tumbled heavily. Currently, the Bitcoin price has dropped below the pivotal support at $102,800, which has dragged down the levels of the majority of the altcoins. The Ethereum price has slumped below $2400, while the Solana price is trading close to $160. Meanwhile, the XRP price is heading close to the barrier at $2.3, while the Cardano price is approaching the crucial barrier at $0.7. On the other hand, the memecoins have also faced a massive bearish action, with BOOK OK MEME recording over a 10% loss, followed by dogwifhat, Fartcoin, and Mog Coin with over an 8% drop. No tokens have been attracting gains, which suggests the bears could have capitulated the market. Why is the Crypto Market Down? Multiple reasons other than the BTC profit-taking have been contributing to the crypto market plunge, like the drop in the ETF inflows, a security breach at Coinbase and a regulatory crackdown on illicit activities of Haowang Guarantee, one of the largest online black markets. On the other hand, the market volatility has triggered substantial liquidations, as more than $650 million worth of positions were liquidated. One of the major reasons for the downfall of not only the crypto markets but also the stock markets is Moody’s decision to downgrade the US credit rating. Moreover, the agency warned that the country’s fiscal outlook was deteriorating as the national debt had risen to over $36.8 trillion from $21 trillion in 2020, which is believed to rise further. What’s Next? Will Bitcoin Price Go Up? The lowered prices of Bitcoin have again attracted the institutions, as MicroStrategy has again accumulated 7,390 BTC. On the other hand, the XRP and Micro XRP Futures are live on the CME Group, which has a major credibility upgrade with institutional futures. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s BTC ETF, IBIT, has pulled in nearly 2X the inflows of the GOLD ETF in 2025. Hence, the momentum appears to be cooling, but the structure stays bullish as retail is piling in while whales quietly accumulate off-exchange, and sentiment’s heating up without tipping into mania. The BTC MACD flashes near-term caution with a bearish crossover, and open interest has pulled back, signalling reduced leverage and some profit-taking. Hence, one can expect a chop or a reset unless buyers step up fast. Besides, the stablecoin inflows on exchanges are rising, and if the BTC price could rise back above $107K on real volume, the upside trend could accelerate. But for now, risk of consolidation or a shallow dip remains in play.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/crypto-markets-are-plunging-hard-is-this-the-best-buying-opportunity/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MOG","Price Analysis|Altcoins",cryptocompare

As institutional interest grows some analysts predict Bitcoin could climb as high as $180,000 by the end of 2025. While this potential 2x move excites traditional crypto investors, others are highlighting high-upside altcoins like Ozak AI , a presale project currently priced at just $0.003. With its AI utility and explosive early momentum, many believe Ozak AI could deliver a 300x return before Bitcoin completes its next big rally. Bitcoin Aims for $180K Bitcoin’s reputation as a store of value and inflation hedge has strengthened over time. Major players like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Tesla have added BTC to their portfolios, driving renewed institutional adoption. Moreover, the April 2024 halving event reduced the mining reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, tightening supply just as demand rises. Historically, this supply shock has led to major price increases. If Bitcoin hits $180,000 from its current levels near $100,000–$103,000, it would be a ~2.5x return — significant for a $1 trillion asset, but modest compared to opportunities in the micro-cap crypto space. While BTC remains a safer long-term bet, its potential upside is likely capped compared to newer, low-cap tokens. Youtube embed: $1 Target Set for OZAK, Buy OZAK AI at $0.003 is The Best Altcoin investment of 2025 Ozak AI: From $0.003 to $1—A 300x Ascent? In contrast to Bitcoin’s steady, institutional-backed rise, Ozak AI is generating buzz as a high-risk, high-reward opportunity. Currently priced at just $0.003 during Ozak AI presale, Ozak AI is an AI-powered platform that allows users to build and deploy intelligent agents for real-world applications in finance, automation, analytics, and more. With AI emerging as one of the hottest investment narratives globally, Ozak AI is riding the perfect storm of innovation and investor interest. What truly sets Ozak AI apart is its goal to combine decentralized finance (DeFi) with artificial intelligence in a user-friendly and highly scalable ecosystem. The project recently surpassed $1 million in presale funding, showing strong early traction. With a deflationary token model, staking options, and multi-chain integration, Ozak AI offers functionality far beyond speculative meme coins. A rise from $0.003 to $1 would represent a massive 300x return, making it one of the most attractive opportunities in the current market. While reaching that price depends on adoption, exchange listings, and utility rollouts, early signs suggest that Ozak AI is building the right foundation to capture long-term value. Bitcoin’s potential to reach $180K makes it an attractive store of value and a key portfolio anchor. However, for investors seeking life-changing gains, small-cap projects like Ozak AI offer far more explosive potential. With a presale price of just $0.003 and a growing narrative around AI integration in Web3, Ozak AI could realistically outpace Bitcoin in terms of percentage growth. For 2025, the smart strategy might be to hold both—but if you’re aiming for maximum ROI, the edge may belong to Ozak AI. About Ozak AI Ozak AI is a blockchain-based project that offers a technology platform that specializes in predictive AI and advanced data analytics for financial markets.

2025-05-19T15:28:10.000Z,"Cardano price has crashed, but a rare pattern, whale buying, points to a rebound","Cardano price has pulled back in the past few days, falling by over 15% from its highest point this month. Cardano ( ADA ) retreated to $0.731 on Monday, down more than 15% from its highest level this month. The decline has raised concerns among investors about whether the recent ADA rally has ended. Cardano price technical analysis points to a rebound Technical analysis points to a potential rebound in the coming days as the credit rating downgrade jitters ease. The four-hour chart shows that Cardano has slowly formed two highly bullish patterns. First, the ongoing retreat appears to be part of a falling wedge pattern, which often leads to a bullish breakout. A falling wedge occurs when two descending and converging trendlines are present, with a breakout typically happening as they near confluence. This wedge is forming after the coin soared from $0.644 to a high of $0.862 last week. That price action suggests the formation of a bullish pennant, a positive continuation pattern that features a sharp upward move followed by a brief consolidation. You might also like: Ethereum price dips as a whale capitulates with a big loss Additionally, although it is premature to predict with certainty, the current pullback appears to be part of the second wave in an Elliott Wave structure. Typically, the second phase is followed by the third, which tends to be the longest and strongest wave. As a result, Cardano is likely to see a bullish breakout, with the next key level to watch being $0.862, its high from May 12, about 18% above the current price. Cardano price chart | Source: crypto.news Potential catalysts for ADA There are three potential catalysts that will push Cardano higher in the coming days. First, there are signs that whales are accumulating ADA coins, a sign that they expect its price to bounce back. The chart below shows that whale accounts holding between 10 million and 100 million coins now hold over 12.93 billion coins, up from 11.8 billion in January. Cardano whales are buying | Source: Santiment Second, Cardano is gearing for the upcoming NIGHT and DUSK airdrops. NIGHT will be the token for Midnight, an upcoming zero-knowledge scaling network. Cardano hopes Midnight will enhance data protection for transactions and dApps in the network. It also hopes that it will become the top player in Bitcoin ( BTC ) staking. Third, odds that the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve Grayscale and Tuttle Capital later this year.

Bitcoin Correction Was Much Needed Bitcoin made an all-time high of around $109K around the time of Trump’s appointment as President of the United States. This move was largely driven by Trump’s overarching promises to make the financial ecosystem more crypto-friendly. The new president’s pro-crypto stance was also why we saw the explosion of PolitiFi coins such as $TRUMP and $MELANIA. After the initial hype, though, the crypto market saw a sharp fall, with Bitcoin reaching as low as $75K, a 25% decrease from its all-time high. Interestingly, Novogratz believes that this correction was crucial to prepare Bitcoin for the next big bull run. At the time of writing, $BTC is comfortably above $100K and is looking set to reach fresh all-time highs. What’s more, some analysts have predicted that Bitcoin could reach $250K by the end of 2025 due to increasing demand and shrinking supply. Rapid corporate and government Bitcoin buying has meant that the asset is facing deflationary pressure, with supply shrinking at the rate of around 2.33% every year. The market is already absorbing all the mined $BTC while exchanges face liquidity issues. Bitcoin’s warped demand-supply equation suggests that the next $BTC bull run is most probably just around the corner. So, this might be your last chance to hop on the Bitcoin train. And if you want to not just board the train but also be seated in its presidential cabin, consider investing in the best Bitcoin-themed altcoin on the market today. Well, no prizes for guessing that we’re talking about BTC Bull Token . What is BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL)? BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is a new meme coin on presale and the biggest Bitcoin supporter we’ve seen in the entire altcoin space. While other tokens like to only associate themselves with $BTC in a pinch, $BTCBULL is on a ‘ride or die’ basis with the king cryptocurrency. That’s because it’s the ONLY crypto to offer free (and 100% real) $BTC to its token holders. No, it’s not April Fool’s Day, folks! It really is true that if you buy BTC Bull Token and store your purchased tokens in Best Wallet , you’ll automatically receive free $BTC every time the developers issue an airdrop. When Will $BTCBULL Give Out Free $BTC? It’s worth noting that a BTC Bull Token airdrop will occur every time Bitcoin reaches a new milestone for the very first time. These milestones include price landmarks that are $50K apart – $150K, $200K, $250K, and so on. Not everything about BTC Bull Token is unconventional, though. It follows in the footsteps of the best meme coins by having a deflationary model in place. Essentially, the total $BTCBULL token supply will be reduced by a small percentage every time Bitcoin’s price rises by $25K. This means that the first Bitcoin Bull token burn event will occur when $BTC reaches $125K, then $150K, $175K, $200K, and so on. What’s the purpose of this? An artificial token burn mechanism ensures a constantly contracting supply. As Bitcoin reaches new all-time highs in the coming weeks, demand for BTC Bull Token (because it’s offering free airdrops for the best crypto in the world) will most likely expand. The deflationary approach, however, will further boost $BTCBULL’s demand. The fewer the number of available tokens, the higher the demand for each. As you might have already guessed, the ultimate goal here is to ensure $BTCBULL’s price follows an upward trajectory. Speaking of $BTCBULL’s price, our meticulously crafted BTC Bull Token price prediction suggests that the crypto can reach $0.0096 by 2026. This will be a nearly 800x increase from current prices. BTC Bull Token Is Currently in Presale Needless to say, if you want to make the most of BTC Bull Token’s predicted potential, you should buy it as early as possible. Luckily for you, the project is currently in presale, meaning you can buy $BTCBULL for some of its lowest-ever prices. Each token is currently available for just $0.00252, and the project in total has raised nearly $6M. If this is your first crypto presale purchase, head over to our full explainer on how to buy BTC Bull Token for step-by-step guidance. With that said, kindly remember that none of this is financial advice. The crypto market is highly unpredictable and volatile, meaning even expert analysis can fail to deliver.

While BTC has been quite volatile in the last 24 hours, El Salvador has made over $357 million in unrealized profits with Bitcoin's recent rise. El Salvador, which broke new ground by accepting Bitcoin as legal currency, continues to accumulate BTC, with Bitcoin assets increasing by $137 million in the last month to over $644 million. According to El Salvador President Nayib Bukele’s X-post, El Salvador’s BTC portfolio is valued at over $644.4 million compared to the initial investment of $287.1 million. According to the data, El Salvador currently has 6,181 BTC worth $644 million, an increase of $137 million in a month. With this number of BTC, El Salvador ranks just behind the USA, China, UK, Ukraine and Bhutan. President Nayib Bukele announced that he would continue to buy BTC despite an agreement with the IMF to halt some Bitcoin activities in the country, and added 30 BTC last month despite the restrictions. As is known, in June 2021, El Salvador became the first country to officially adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, as proposed by Bukele in order to promote financial inclusion.

2025-05-19T15:22:26.000Z,"What is the Growth Forecast for RXS Crypto Price if Bitcoin Hits $125k, $150k and $200k?","The post What is the Growth Forecast for RXS Crypto Price if Bitcoin Hits $125k, $150k and $200k? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Rexas Finance (RXS) is emerging as a transformative force in the crypto market, linking blockchain technology to real-world assets like real estate, gold, and commodities. Analysts project RXS could reach $10 if Bitcoin climbs to $125k, $15 at $150k, and $30 with BTC at $200k. These predictions stem from RXS’s unique utility in asset tokenization, a sector poised to exceed $16 trillion by 2030. The platform’s presale has already raised over $48.4 million, with its token price surging 6.6x from $0.03 to $0.20 in 12 stages. With a confirmed listing price of $0.25 set for 2025, RXS combines innovation, security, and accessibility, positioning it as a standout investment ahead of Bitcoin’s anticipated bull run. Transforming Global Asset Ownership Rexas Finance is redefining how physical assets are bought, sold, and managed. By converting real estate, precious metals, and intellectual property into blockchain tokens, the platform enables fractional ownership accessible to anyone with an internet connection. Imagine a retail investor in Jakarta owning 5% of a luxury apartment in Dubai, earning passive rental income without geographical barriers. This model unlocks opportunities in markets traditionally dominated by high-net-worth individuals or institutions. The global real estate sector alone exceeds $300 trillion, while gold’s market capitalization sits above $12 trillion. Rexas Finance taps into these colossal industries, offering a seamless bridge between tangible value and blockchain efficiency. The ERC-20 token powers this ecosystem, allowing users to mint, trade, or stake asset-backed tokens. Each transaction benefits from Ethereum’s security and transparency, eliminating intermediaries that inflate costs and delay processes. Whether acquiring full ownership of a vineyard in Chile or a fractional share in a Tokyo office tower, Rexas Finance ensures liquidity and flexibility. Democratizing Asset Tokenization Rexas Finance equips users with tools to tokenize assets independently. The Rexas Token Builder simplifies creating compliant digital tokens, while the Launchpad lets projects raise capital directly from global investors. A restaurant owner in Barcelona can tokenize 30% of their business, offering investors profit shares via RXS. The Quickmint Bot accelerates this process, integrating AI-driven analytics to optimize token parameters. Security remains paramount. Rexas Finance completed a CertiK audit, verifying the integrity of its smart contracts and protocols. This approval reassures investors, evidenced by a recent $100,000 RXS purchase (500,000 tokens at $0.20 each) by a whale address. Over 92.4% of the 500 million presale tokens have been sold, reflecting robust demand. Unlike projects reliant on venture capital, Rexas Finance prioritized public participation, reserving 50% of its 1 billion tokens for presale buyers. Building Momentum Through Strategic Growth Rexas Finance is gaining visibility across major platforms. Listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko expose the project to over 100 million monthly users, enhancing credibility and liquidity. Plans to launch on three top-tier exchanges in 2025 will further amplify its reach. The ongoing $1 million Rexas Millionaire Giveaway incentivizes community growth, offering 20 winners $50,000 each for completing social tasks and referrals. Staking pools and a 22.5% token allocation reward long-term holders, aligning investor interests with platform growth. With $48.4 million secured in its presale, RXS enters its final stage before transitioning to full-scale operations. The team’s decision to delay the launch until 2025 ensures that all systems, from AI-driven asset management (GenAI) to fraud detection (AI Shield), are optimized for scalability. Positioning for Growth in a Shifting Market Bitcoin’s potential ascent to $200k could catalyze altcoin rallies, with RXS positioned to outperform speculative tokens. Its $30 target represents a 150x surge from the current $0.20 presale price, outpacing typical market gains. Analysts attribute this potential to RXS’s real-world utility, CertiK-backed security, and presale momentum. For investors seeking projects grounded in tangible value, Rexas Finance offers a compelling proposition. The window to join the presale closes once stage 12 concludes, with tokens transitioning to exchanges at $0.25. As blockchain adoption intersects with trillion-dollar asset markets, RXS stands at the forefront of a financial revolution—one click, one token, and endless possibilities.

Her comments have sparked optimism among long term holders who view the recent dip as a buying opportunity not a trend reversal. Bitcoin Technical Analysis: Rebound or Breakdown? Technically Bitcoin is rebounding from a key trend line at $102,750. A bullish engulfing candle followed by a reclaim of the 50-EMA ($103,692) suggests buyers are defending the structure. On the 2H chart BTC has printed a higher low which could lead to a test of the resistance levels at $105,539 and $107,084. Bullish momentum: MACD histogram turned green* Signal lines about to cross Volume on the rebound Price above 50-EMA But if it can’t stay above $103,692 it could retest $102,750 and then $100,782. Until a strong candle closes above $105,539 short term rallies will still face selling. Conclusion: Bitcoin is still choppy short term but Ark Invest’s long term target has got everyone’s attention. Be nimble and wait for the technicals to confirm before going long or short. BTC Bull Token Nears $6.98M Cap as 71% Staking Yield Drives Demand As BTC holding near $104K, investor focus is shifting toward yield-generating altcoins—none more so than BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The token has now raised $5.87 million out of its $6.84 million presale goal, with a price increase looming as it enters its final funding stretch. What sets BTCBULL apart is its flexible staking model, offering an estimated 71% annual yield with no lockups or withdrawal penalties. This approach gives investors the freedom to earn passive income while maintaining full liquidity—an attractive alternative to traditional DeFi staking protocols. Key Stats: USDT Raised: $5,977,397.02/ $6,981,682 Token Price: $0.00252 Staking Pool: 1.47B BTCBULL Yield: 71% APY BTCBULL merges the viral appeal of meme tokens with the real-world utility of DeFi, making it a standout pick for those looking to capitalize on the 2025 crypto cycle.

One of the new best meme coins does – and so does Arizona. But does Bitcoin itself? The world’s leading crypto continues to waffle about, jumping at times to within range of the ATH, then falling back down. The past 24 hours have been a case in point: In the early morning hours, $BTC briefly traded near $107K, before falling back and eventually trading down nearly 2% from where it started. Why? Keeping Bitcoin down is general market uncertainty, stock market turmoil, and a crypto regulatory environment that only changes slowly in favor of $BTC. On the plus side is the money – particularly from financial institutions with deep pockets. Here’s the current level of inflows into $BTC ETFs: These are the eleven biggest Bitcoin spot ETFs, looking green across the board. And despite the uncertainty, there are still positive signs on the regulatory front also. Let’s see, what else? Arizona Puts Spare Digital Change Into Bitcoin Piggy Bank Unclaimed digital assets are becoming a surprising problem. In an era when more and more people use digital currencies, some of those assets sit untouched in various exchanges and accounts. Think of them as digital spare change and loose coins, falling down between the cracks of your electronic couch cushions. And Arizona’s coming around with the vacuum to hoover it all up. It’s a surprisingly forward-thinking proposal from the US state, which has officially created the second state-level Bitcoin reserve. To fund that reserve, Arizona will include digital assets that go unclaimed for more than five years. And if you shudder at the word ‘include,’ thinking it sounds a lot like ‘take,’ there’s actually a pleasant surprise in the legislation. Arizona plans to use a public ledger – the blockchain itself – to track all the funds included in the reserve. If the original owners come forward to claim them, every penny should be accounted for. In the meantime, Arizona will be able to leverage the funds for passive yield like staking rewards, potentially returning 10% of the reserve’s profit each year back into the state’s general fund. If owners don’t come forward within three years of the assets being included in the fund, the assets can be liquidated entirely. If successful, the plan could blaze a trail for state-level management of digital assets with full transparency. It could even set a precedent for the US digital reserve, or for more controversial measures like CBDCs (ouch). And in the meantime, it adds more fuel to Bitcoin’s fire – and could push the crypto to at or near the all-time high. It also sets the stage for a Bitcoin meme coin that’s blazing its own path to glory. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – New Meme Coin Doubles Down on Bitcoin’s Rise BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) doesn’t think $BTC will hit a new all-time high. $BTCBULL thinks Bitcoin will utterly smash the new all-time high on its way to $250K – and beyond. For that reason, the developers of one of the best meme coins tied $BTCBULL and $BTC together using an innovative combination of airdrops and token burns. At key $BTC price milestones – namely $125K, $175K, and $225K – $BTCBULL tokens will be burned, exerting deflationary pressure on the token price. At $150K and $200K, investors holding $BTCBULL in their Best Wallet app accounts will receive free $BTC airdrops. The more $BTCBULL they hold, the more $BTC they receive. And when Bitcoin hits $250K, a massive $BTCBULL airdrop awAdded ‘token’ to BTC Bull nameFour ways to earn, not three (added staking APY)aits. BTC Bull Token is a meme coin that rides the wave of Bitcoin’s success, but it also has a unique utility; Bitcoin believers can leverage $BTCBULL to earn even more from their crypto. With $BTCBULL, there are four ways to earn: $BTCBULL price increase $BTCBULL airdrop $BTC airdrops Staking APY (69% at the moment) For a price – currently $0.00252 – that’s a mere fraction of Bitcoin’s, BTC Bull Token holders gain more ways to profit from Bitcoin’s rise. Time to put that spare change to work. Learn how to buy BTC Bull Token, and see why our price prediction says $BTCBULL could reach $0.006467 by the end of the year, a full 156% increase. Arizona Joins the Bulls to Run with Bitcoin Arizona’s decision to establish a state reserve isn’t just an innovative public use of blockchain tech. It’s actually an endorsement of a bullish attitude towards Bitcoin and crypto in general.

The move marks an important turning point for the company, which is quietly becoming a dominant institutional player in the Solana ecosystem. We're excited to welcome Mr Leigh Travers and Ms Ieva Guoga to the DigitalX Board as Non-Executive Directors. • Mr Travers will also assume the role of Chair of the Company. He brings deep industry experience, including his roles as former CEO of DigitalX and Binance Australia,… pic.twitter.com/OmjWJHIsiv — DigitalX Ltd (@DigitalXLtd) May 19, 2025 Since November 2024, DigitalX has been aggressively accumulating SOL, and now holds 83,279 SOL, ranking it among the top five public holders of Solana globally. Coupled with 319.66 BTC (fund units of BTC ETF and direct BTC) and over AUD 6.44 million in other digital assets, the company’s underlying value now rivals that of larger-cap peers, yet its market capitalization remains at USD 50.4 million. Aside from digital asset-focused ETFs, DigitalX is the only Australian-listed crypto company. New Board Appointments Signal ShiftToward Solana and Global Markets According to the announcement published on May 19, 2025, Leigh Travers and Ieva Guoga have been appointed non-executive directors. Travers, former CEO of both Binance Australia and DigitalX, now leads capital markets at Animoca Brands and brings deep operational and strategic experience across ASX, NASDAQ, and CSE-listed digital firms. Ieva Guoga is a rising force in Solana infrastructure. She is currently working with SOL Strategies Inc., a Canadian-listed blockchain firm known for its high-performance validator network. She is also the daughter of Antanas Guoga, aka Tony G, the chairman of SOL Strategies, adding another layer of strategic synergy between the two firms. Her involvement deepens DigitalX’s alignment with Solana’s core infrastructure, especially its validator ecosystem. Outgoing Chair Toby Hicks and Director Davide Bosio have stepped down, while the new appointees have been granted 10 million options each, exercisable at AUD $0.10 within five years. This further indicates long-term alignment with shareholder value creation. DigitalX Powers Up Solana Exposure, Positions as Institutional Gateway DigitalX’s strategic moves come amid a broader resurgence in digital asset markets, with Solana increasingly viewed by institutions as a foundation for real-world blockchain applications and yield generation. The company’s approach aligns with trends of diversifying exposure to Bitcoin and high-conviction Layer 1 assets like Solana. Notably, through its recent partnership with SOL Strategies , the company stakes its SOL holdings with a validator network optimized for uptime and yield, turning its assets into a regulated, revenue-generating staking operation. @solstrategies_ & @DigitalXLtd team up for institutional Solana staking backed by @BitGo 's custody. #Solana #Staking #SOL https://t.co/py8wXMGXE7 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 13, 2025 According to the announcement on May 12, BitGo, one of the most trusted names in institutional crypto security, handles custody of these assets. Additionally, the partnership between DigitalX and SOL Strategies coincides with the tie-up with Superstate’s Opening Bell, which will enable SEC-registered public shares to be issued and traded directly on blockchains, starting with Solana.

However, despite holding a high-value digital asset portfolio and generating AUD 2.5 million in annual recurring revenue from its fund management arm, DigitalX continues to trade close to its NAV, a valuation gap that increasingly looks unsustainable. The company’s financials for the half-year ended December 2024 show a 36.3% increase in revenue and a 3% reduction in operational expenses, with a narrowing operating loss and a 24.9% increase in net assets compared to June 2024. These improvements, driven by staking activities and cost discipline, are moving DigitalX closer to breakeven and potential profitability. With operational costs decreasing, revenue growing, and digital asset holdings expanding, DigitalX is transitioning from a quiet digital asset fund into a key institutional access point to the Solana economy.

2025-05-19T15:01:12.000Z,"Who’s got the charm, cash and code to be a crypto hub?","Kazakhstan, the Maldives and Pakistan have recently outlined ambitions to position themselves as crypto hubs and build out their digital economies.Historically, these countries haven’t been top of mind for global crypto firms — though Kazakhstan did have a brief moment in the spotlight as a go-to destination for Bitcoin (BTC) miners after China’s mining ban.Meanwhile, established financial centers are now in a race to become the world’s leading crypto hub by finding the right balance of regulation, talent, capital and infrastructure.Here’s how five of them are backing their crypto dreams.Singapore is the crypto hub with parental guidanceSingapore has long stood out as a financial hub, bolstered by its AAA credit rating, low corporate tax rates and pro-business regulations. With the emergence of digital assets, the Lion City is among the front-runners in the crypto hub race.Singapore was among the early movers in crypto regulation. Its Payment Services Act (PSA) of 2019 — enacted in 2020 — was one of Asia’s first comprehensive legal frameworks that covered crypto activities. The PSA uses the term “digital payment token” (DPT) to define digital representation of value that can be transferred, stored or traded electronically — like crypto.At the time of writing, there are 33 DPT service providers licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the city-state’s central bank. Casper Johansen, co-founder of Singapore- and Hong Kong-based Spartan Group, said license approvals have moved at a measured pace, giving faster-moving hubs like Dubai room to catch up.“Singapore is more of an institutional financial hub than a retail financial hub,” Johansen said, alluding to the city-state’s limitations on crypto marketing to retail investors.Singapore’s retail crypto promotion ban includes social media influencer marketing and third-party websites. Source: Monetary Authority of Singapore“The ban on marketing to retail has not affected Singapore’s position as a global crypto hub. Crypto firms set up in Singapore for the low and transparent taxes, strong regulatory framework and rule of law, world-class professional services, ease of living and global connectivity,” Johansen added.But cracks have emerged recently, particularly around immigration and hiring policy. In late 2024, concerns flared when the CEO of blockchain analytics firm Nansen, Alex Svanevik, shared that he was denied permanent residency. The government has ramped up efforts to prioritize local hiring amid growing political sensitivity over foreign labor.Nansen CEO’s permanent residency rejection highlighted Singapore’s tight visa and immigration environment. Source: Alex SvanevikUAE rolls out the welcome mat for crypto hub statusUnlike other crypto hub contenders, Dubai has a dedicated digital asset regulator, the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA). Its wide-ranging licensing regime provides clear guidelines — even for NFT platforms — which major economies like the European Union have yet to address. The EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework currently excludes NFTs.VARA’s clarity is appealing to companies frustrated by regulatory uncertainty elsewhere. Binance, a borderless exchange with no official head office, has had to rethink that model under global regulatory pressure — and the exchange’s ties to the UAE have been growing.Richard Teng, former CEO of free zone Abu Dhabi Global Market, took over as the CEO of Binance after Zhao, and has recently hinted that UAE is a strong candidate for the exchange’s headquarters, though a decision hasn’t been made yet.Binance’s first institutional investment is a $2-billion bet from Abu Dhabi-based MGX. Source: BinanceThe UAE also provides its own incentives, such as no personal income tax and free zones like the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC) and Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) offer 0% corporate tax advantages and 100% foreign ownership.Related: The lessons learned at Operation Chokepoint 2.0 Congressional hearingsCrypto firms have reported easier access to banking services in Dubai, which is an improvement over the challenges companies say they’ve faced in the US under “Operation Chokepoint 2.0.”Hong Kong makes crypto hub push with retail access and staking ETFsHong Kong has long acted as a financial gateway to mainland China, where crypto activities like mining and trading remain banned.Previously, the city had a voluntary licensing regime, when only OSL and HashKey were licensed to serve institutions and professional investors. In Hong Kong, professional investors are legally defined as those with portfolios worth at least 8 million Hong Kong dollars (about $1 million). It was later updated to the mandatory regime, launched in 2023, which opened the doors to retail. The shift to mandatory licensing marked a turning point. OSL and HashKey became the first exchanges authorized to serve retail investors, while firms like Bybit and OKX withdrew their applications and exited the market. As of now, 10 platforms are licensed, while 15 have either withdrawn or been rejected.Eight applicants in Hong Kong still wait the SFC’s decision.

As Arvin Abraham, partner at law firm Goodwin’s private equity group, told Cointelegraph, crypto was once central to Sunak’s competitiveness agenda, but under the current Labour government, that focus has faded.The new Financial Services Growth and Competitiveness Strategy, spearheaded by Chancellor Rachel Reeves, highlights fintech as a priority without a focus solely on crypto.“The UK does not feel like it’s prioritizing it as much as it was a few years ago,” Abraham said.In January, Andreessen Horowitz announced the closure of its UK office to move back to the US. Source: Anthony AlbaneseAbraham added the UK remains “one of the best places to set up a new startup,” especially for early-stage capital raising. He points to generous tax incentives for angel investors and the unique convergence of finance and startups in London, calling it “probably one of the best cities in the world for fintech-type businesses.” In that sense, even without headline-grabbing crypto policy, the UK’s structural appeal still draws Web3 firms — just now with a quieter backdrop.Magazine: South Africa’s digital-nomad crypto hub: Cape Town, Crypto City Guide",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/cash-code-crypto-hub-uk-us-singapore?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-19T15:00:00.000Z,"Community sales are the future of crypto fundraising","Opinion by: Darius Moukhtarzadeh, Research Strategist at 21SharesA new wave of crypto fundraising is emerging, changing how Web3 projects launch and who can invest at an early stage: Community Sales. At first glance, community sales may seem reminiscent of the ICO (Initial Coin Offering) era from 2016–2017. Yet, they represent a significant evolution that better aligns with crypto's core values of democratization, transparency, and inclusivity.Projects should include community sales as a core element of their fundraising strategy, besides raising from angel investors and VCs. Professional investors should embrace community sales as they highly increase the chances of sustainable success of Web3 projects. The ICO eraThe original ICO boom promised broad retail participation and democratized investment opportunities previously reserved for well-connected insiders. The lack of clear regulatory frameworks led to widespread fraud, rug pulls, and market manipulation. This chaotic environment, rampant exploitation, and regulatory uncertainty eventually forced projects to abandon ICOs, shifting instead to private rounds accessible to well-connected angel investors and venture capitalists. Private funding problemsWhile private funding initially brought much-needed stability and credibility, it also introduced new problems. Over the past two years, many tokens have launched at excessively high FDVs (Fully Diluted Valuation) with a low circulating token supply. These tokens entered exchanges with the majority of supply locked and sky-high valuation, which did not meet the demand. Retail investors, attracted by initial hype, often became collateral damage. The result? Devalued tokens and damaged trust. Most of these tokens will most likely never recover. This market dynamic discouraged investments in new projects and undermined community-building efforts, weakening the overall sustainability of Web3 projects.Airdrops as an unsustainable alternativeAirdrops appeared as another alternative, designed to distribute tokens widely and spark interest in the community for a project. Airdrops frequently fail to produce meaningful, sustainable engagement. Instead, they often became targets for Sybil attackers employing multiple accounts to maximize token gains or airdrop mercenaries hopping from one project to the next, quickly dumping tokens, depressing prices and undermining project credibility. Without genuine financial commitment and interest in the project beyond the airdrop, recipients had little incentive to hold tokens or participate actively in the community.Community sales as the new cool kid on the block(chain)Community sales represent a practical, strategic alternative to private funding and token airdrops, offering a structured way to engage retail investors meaningfully and transparently. Modern community sales on platforms like Legion and Echo feature robust regulatory frameworks, with thorough KYC and AML processes ensuring regulatory compliance and security. These inclusive fundraising opportunities require participants to make real capital commitments, even if modest, cultivating genuine stakeholder interest and reducing short-term speculation.Recent: Blockchain needs efficient use cases for AI agents: X Spaces recap with VCsOne of the most significant advantages of community sales is their ability to democratize access. Investors gain entry under equitable terms, similar or sometimes superior to those previously reserved for venture capitalists. With minimum investments often as low as $100, community sales encourage broad participation, helping to build a genuinely decentralized and committed investor base. Investors who financially commit are far more likely to become long-term holders and active community members.Win-win for projects, other investors, and the communityFor Web3 projects, community sales offer profound benefits beyond immediate capital raising. Early community involvement leads to a more distributed investor base, reducing concentration risk and diverse future users. Projects with broadly distributed tokens consistently exhibit more stable prices, higher community activity, and healthier onchain engagement. Community sales significantly enhance a project's market reputation. Embracing transparent, inclusive fundraising sends a clear signal to the market and prospective users — the project prioritizes collaboration and community involvement over the extraction of value. This transparency builds grassroots evangelism, drives organic growth, and creates a loyal community base committed to the project's ongoing success. Professional investors should embrace community sales and actively encourage their portfolio companies to allocate to the community. The broader crypto market benefits substantially from a shift toward community sales. Projects that raise funds transparently and inclusively from their communities tend to attract more stable, supportive investor bases. This stability positively affects token markets, reducing volatility, restoring investor confidence, and accelerating broader adoption and integration of blockchain technologies into everyday financial services and applications.Community sales represent far more than a revival of ICOs. They mark a mature approach, combining early crypto ideals with today's regulatory clarity and technological possibilities. Projects committed to community sales position themselves for initial fundraising success, enduring market resilience, and community loyalty. The crypto ecosystem, founded on principles of decentralization and inclusivity, should embrace this model to fulfill its potential. Founders should, where possible, include the community when raising capital, as in the end, everyone wins: WAGMI.The views and opinions expressed in this article are solely my own and do not reflect the views of my employer, 21Shares, or any affiliated organizations.Opinion by: Darius Moukhtarzadeh, Research Strategist at 21Shares.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Analysis of those files confirmed that they were compromised by two distinct pieces of malware: backdoor Win32.Backdoor.XRedRAT.A and a crypto stealer designed to substitute addresses in the clipboard with those controlled by the attacker.G-Data contacted Procolored, with the hardware producer saying it deleted the infected drivers from its storage on May 8 and re-scanned all files.

2025-05-19T14:00:00.000Z,"Franklin taps blockchain to offer yield on idle payroll funds","Franklin, a hybrid cash and crypto payroll provider, is launching a new initiative that aims to turn idle-sitting payroll into an opportunity for yield.The new solution, dubbed Payroll Treasury Yield, uses blockchain lending protocols to help firms earn returns on payroll funds that would otherwise sit idle, the company told Cointelegraph in an exclusive statement.Franklin said its new offering integrates Summer.fi, a decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform, to allow companies to deposit stablecoin-denominated payroll reserves into smart contract-based lending pools.These funds are lent to vetted borrowers, and companies earn yields while retaining access to their capital. Companies maintain full custody throughout the process, and smart contracts used are audited to reduce risk.“The problem that Franklin solves for is two-fold,” Megan Knab, founder and CEO of Franklin, told Cointelegraph. For companies that have already integrated crypto onto their balance sheets, Franklin helps them use those assets to manage their operations, she said.“But for the broader market, we are enabling business models of the future, where money moves instantly, more intelligently, and to more globally,” Knab added.Source: FranklinRelated: PayPal to offer 3.7% yield on stablecoin balances: ReportAlternative to T-BillsFranklin said its new offering is an alternative to traditional treasury tools like sweep accounts or T-bills, which often involve operational complexity and limited returns.Furthermore, it differentiates from earned wage access (EWA) platforms, which enable employees to access their earned wages before their scheduled payday by avoiding additional debt and associated costs.“Traditional payments in the next decade will run entirely on public blockchain rails as a wholesale replacement to ACH and SWIFT,” Knab said.She added that if onchain payroll products go mainstream, banks could fade into the background. While technology may replace many banking functions with self-custody tools and smart contracts, regulatory frameworks will still require accountable legal entities.The result may be “zombie-like institutions” — banks in name only, existing to meet compliance rules but playing a minimal role in actual payment processing, Knab said.However, decentralized lending comes with risks like smart contract vulnerabilities and market fluctuations. Franklin said it aims to mitigate these by using Summer.fi’s audited contracts and overcollateralized lending.Related: How to Use tsUSDe on TON for Passive Dollar Yield in 2025Rising interest in yield-generating strategiesInterest in yield-generating strategies within the cryptocurrency sector has surged in recent years, driven by both retail and institutional investors seeking to maximize returns on their digital assets.On May 16, Solv Protocol launched a yield-bearing Bitcoin token on the Avalanche blockchain, giving institutional investors more exposure to yield opportunities backed by real-world assets, or RWAs.On May 1, Ryan Chow, co-founder and CEO of Solv Protocol, said the demand for yield-generating strategies around Bitcoin is surging, especially from firms seeking liquidity without liquidating their BTC.Magazine: Arthur Hayes $1M Bitcoin tip, altcoins’ powerful rally’ looms: Hodler’s Digest, May 11 – 17",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/franklin-launches-payroll-treasury-yield-defi?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-19T11:49:01.000Z,"Australian court ruling could lead to $640M in Bitcoin tax refunds","A court decision in Australia could open the door to as much as $640 million in capital gains tax (CGT) refunds on Bitcoin transactions after a judge ruled that crypto should be treated as money rather than a taxable asset. On May 19, the Australian Financial Review (AFR) reported that the decision arose within a criminal case involving federal police officer William Wheatley, who allegedly stole 81.6 Bitcoin (BTC) in 2019. At the time, the assets were worth roughly $492,000. At current market prices, the tokens are valued at more than $13 million.In the case, Judge Michael O’Connell of Victoria ruled that Bitcoin qualifies as a form of money rather than property, likening the digital asset to Australian dollars rather than to shares, gold or foreign currency.The interpretation could set a legal precedent, potentially placing Bitcoin transactions outside the scope of Australia’s current CGT regime.  New court ruling challenges Australian crypto tax lawsIn an AFR interview, tax lawyer Adrian Cartland said the verdict “totally upends” the Australian Taxation Office’s (ATO) current position. Since 2014, the ATO has classified crypto assets as CGT assets. This means that users must pay tax when selling or trading them. Under the ATO’s guidance, any disposal of Bitcoin, including selling it for fiat, exchanging it for another crypto or using it to purchase goods or services, constitutes a CGT event. This framework has been the basis for taxing cryptocurrency transactions in Australia for over a decade. However, the recent ruling challenges the approach by suggesting that Bitcoin functions more like money than property. This potentially exempts it from CGT.Related: Australian feds seize mansion, Bitcoin allegedly linked to crypto exchange hackTax refunds could reach $640 millionCartland said it was held that Bitcoin is Australian money. “That is, it is not a CGT asset. Therefore, acquisitions and disposals of Bitcoin have no tax consequences,” the tax lawyer added. If the ruling is upheld on the appeal, Cartland estimates that there could be potential tax refunds totalling 1 billion Australian dollars ($640 million). However, while Cartland thinks there could be up to a billion in refunds, the ATO said there were no official figures that confirm the amount to be potentially refunded if the case changes how Bitcoin is taxed in Australia. Magazine: Binance Wallet ‘killing’ MetaMask and airdrops, Chinese RWA tokens: Asia Express",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/australia-bitcoin-tax-ruling-cgt-refunds?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

This includes advisory, broker-dealer, custody, exchange, lending and borrowing, virtual asset (VA) management and investment, and VA transfer and settlement services. A VARA spokesperson told Cointelegraph that the updates will bring consistency across all activity-based rules defining core operational terms. The spokesperson gave examples of terms like “client assets,” “qualified custodians,” and “collateral requirements” as some of the terms more consistently defined in the update.  The update also aligned risk management and disclosure obligations, where activities overlap, in areas like brokerage, custody and exchange. “The aim was to reduce ambiguity and help VASPs navigate cross-functional compliance more easily,” VARA told Cointelegraph. Related: Dubai gov’t agencies to link real estate registry with property tokenizationDubai regulator tightens leverage thresholds for margin tradingAs for margin trading, the VARA spokesperson said they tightened leverage thresholds, mandated clearer collateralisation standards, and enhanced the monitoring obligations for VASPs offering this feature. Margin trading allows traders to control large positions with smaller amounts of capital. It amplifies both gains and losses. Tightening the leverage traders use helps limit the risks of widespread liquidations in a market downturn. The crypto regulator introduced a new section on token distribution that sets out licensing prerequisites, investor protections and marketing restrictions.

2025-05-19T08:55:00.000Z,"Crypto drainers as a service: What you need to know","What is a crypto drainer?              A crypto drainer is a malicious script designed to steal cryptocurrency from your wallet. Unlike regular phishing attacks that try to capture login credentials, a crypto drainer tricks you into connecting your wallets, such as MetaMask or Phantom, and unknowingly authorizing transactions that grant them access to your funds.Disguised as a legitimate Web3 project, a crypto drainer is usually promoted via compromised social media accounts or Discord groups. Once you fall prey to the fraud, the drainer can instantly transfer assets from the wallet.Crypto drainers may take various forms:Malicious smart contracts that initiate unauthorized transfers.Fake NFTs or token systems that create deceptive exchanges or assets.Crypto drainers are a growing threat in Web3, enabling quick, automated theft of crypto assets from unsuspecting users through deception. Common methods of crypto drainers include: Phishing websites.Fake airdrops.Deceptive ads.Malicious smart contracts.Harmful browser extensions.Fake NFT marketplaces.                  Crypto drainers-as-a-service (DaaS), explained              DaaS elevates the threat of crypto drainers by commercializing them. Just like  software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms, DaaS platforms sell ready-to-use malware kits to cybercriminals, often in exchange for a percentage of the stolen funds.In the DaaS model, developers offer turnkey draining scripts, customizable phishing kits and even integration help in exchange for a share of the stolen funds. A DaaS offer might be bundled with social engineering support, anonymization services and regular updates, making them attractive even to low-skill scammers.Types of crypto DaaS tools include:JavaScript-based drainers: Malicious JavaScript is embedded into phishing websites that mimic legitimate decentralized apps (DApps). These scripts execute when you connect your wallet, silently triggering approval transactions that drain assets. Token approval malware: Tricks users into granting unlimited token access via malicious smart contracts.Clipboard hijackers: Hackers use clipboard hijackers to monitor and replace copied wallet addresses with those controlled by attackers. Info-stealers: They harvest browser data, wallet extensions and private keys. Some DaaS packages combine these with loader malware that drops additional payloads or updates the malicious code. Modular drainer kits: Segregated into modules, these drainers use obfuscation techniques to bypass browser-based security tools. Did you know? According to Scam Sniffer, phishing campaigns using wallet drainers siphoned off over $295 million in NFTs and tokens from unsuspecting users in 2023.                  What crypto DaaS kits include              Crypto DaaS kits are pre-built toolsets sold to scammers, enabling them to steal digital assets with minimal technical skill. These kits typically include phishing page templates, malicious smart contracts, wallet-draining scripts and more.This is what crypto DaaS kits generally include:Pre-built drainer software: Plug-and-play malware requiring minimal setup.Phishing kits: DaaS providers supply customizable phishing website templates that hackers can modify according to their plans.Social engineering: With DaaS, hackers find support for social engineering along with psychological tactics to trick users into connecting their wallets.Operational security (OPSEC) tools: To avoid detection, some DaaS vendors offer advanced operational security tools that mask user identity and hide digital footprints.Integration assistance and/obfuscation: These services help attackers deploy drainer scripts seamlessly and use obfuscation tools to evade tracking.Regular updates: Frequent improvements are designed to bypass wallet defenses and detection systems.User-friendly dashboards: Control panels that help attackers oversee operations and monitor drained funds.Documentation and tutorials: Step-by-step instructions enabling even beginners to execute scams efficiently.Customer support: Some DaaS operators provide real-time help through secure messaging apps like Telegram.With DaaS kits available for as little as $100 to $500, or through subscription models, sophisticated crypto attacks are no longer limited to experienced hackers. Even the inexperienced can now access these scripts with a small budget, effectively democratizing this type of crime.Did you know? Advanced DaaS tools often update scripts to evade detection from browser extensions like WalletGuard and security alerts issued by MetaMask or Trust Wallet.                  Evolution of crypto drainers as prominent fraudulent activity              The threat landscape of cryptocurrency fraud is constantly evolving. Emerging around 2021, crypto drainers have rapidly transformed the landscape. Their ability to stealthily siphon funds from users' wallets has made them a threat that demands vigilance.Drainers specifically designed to target MetaMask began to emerge around 2021 and were openly advertised on illicit online forums and marketplaces.Here are some prominent drainers that have been around for some time:Chick Drainer: It emerged in late 2023, targeting Solana (SOL) users through phishing campaigns. It operates using the CLINKSINK script, embedded in fake airdrop websites.Rainbow Drainer: The platform shares code similarities with Chick Drainer, suggesting potential reuse or collaboration among threat actors.Angel Drainer: Launched around August 2023, Angel Drainer is widely promoted on Telegram by threat groups like GhostSec. Affiliate scammers need to make an upfront payment between $5,000 and $10,000 and also pay a 20% commission on all stolen assets facilitated through its platform.Rugging’s Drainer: Compatible with several crypto platforms, this DaaS drainer offers comparatively low commission fees, typically ranging from 5% to 10% of the stolen proceeds. In the wake of the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s X account being compromised in January 2024, Chainalysis found a crypto drainer acting as the SEC. This led users to connect their wallets in an attempt to claim nonexistent airdropped tokens.According to a Kaspersky Security Bulletin, dark web threads discussing crypto drainers rose sharply in 2024, jumping by 135% to 129 threads from 55 in 2022. These conversations encompass a wide range of topics, including buying and selling malicious software and forming distribution teams.As the following chart demonstrates, crypto drainers have been stealing crypto at a faster quarterly growth rate than even ransomware.                  Red flags to identify a crypto DaaS attack              Spotting a crypto wallet drainer attack early is crucial to minimizing potential losses and securing your assets. You must be careful, as a sophisticated drainer attack can sometimes evade standard alert mechanisms. You must remain vigilant even while relying on automated tools. Here are a few indicators that your wallet may be under threat:Unusual transactions: A red flag of a drainer attack is finding transactions you didn’t authorize. These may include unexpected token transfers or withdrawals to unknown wallet addresses. Sometimes, attackers execute multiple small transfers to avoid detection, so you must monitor for repeated unusual transactions of low-value crypto. Lost access to wallet: If you cannot access your wallet or your funds are missing, it could mean an attacker has taken control. This often happens when the drainer changes private keys or recovery phrases, effectively locking you out. Security alerts from wallet providers: Your crypto wallet may issue security alerts for suspicious actions, like logins from new devices, failed access attempts or unauthorized transactions. These warnings indicate that someone may be trying to access your wallet or has already accessed it.Fake project websites or DApps: If you find a cloned or newly launched platform mimicking a real Web3 service and prompting wallet connections, it is a warning sign of a crypto drainer. It might also have urgent calls to action, urging users to immediately claim rewards, airdrops, or mint NFTs. The objective is to pressure victims into connecting wallets without verifying authenticity.Unverified social media promotions: Suspicious links shared via X, Discord, Telegram or Reddit, often unverified profiles, indicate a fraudulent attempt to drain money from a wallet. Fraudsters may also use compromised accounts to share malicious links. Unaudited smart contracts: Interacting with unfamiliar contracts without public audits or GitHub transparency can expose wallets to hidden drainer scripts.Wallet prompts requesting broad permissions: Sign-in or approval requests that ask for full token spending access or access to all assets, rather than specific transactions, are serious warning signs.Did you know? Just one popular drainer kit can be used by hundreds of affiliates. That means a single DaaS platform can be behind thousands of wallet thefts in a matter of days.                  How to protect your crypto wallet from DaaS attackers              To protect your crypto wallet from DaaS attackers, adopting strong, proactive security practices is essential. Blockchain monitoring tools can help identify suspicious patterns linked to drainer activity, allowing you to respond quickly. Here are key strategies to help protect your digital assets:Use hardware wallets: Hardware wallets, or cold wallets, store private keys offline, shielding them from online threats like malware and phishing. Keeping your keys in a physical device significantly lowers the risk of remote attacks and is ideal for securing long-term crypto holdings.Enable 2FA (two-factor authentication): Adding 2FA to your wallet means even if someone steals your password, they will need a second verification step. They need to put in a verification code sent to your phone to access the account, along with your password, making unauthorized access much harder.Avoid phishing links: Always verify URLs and avoid clicking on unsolicited messages claiming rewards or updates. Never input private keys or seed phrases on suspicious sites. When in doubt, manually enter the correct website address.Secure your private keys and seed phrases: Store your private keys and seed phrases offline in a safe, physical location. Never save these credentials on internet-connected devices, or hackers might get access to them, putting your wallet at risk. Verify apps and browser extensions: Take care to install software only from official sources. Research apps beforehand to avoid malicious or fake tools.Monitor wallet activity regularly: Check your wallet for unauthorized transactions or unusual patterns. Early detection can help stop further losses and improve recovery chances.                  What to do if you suffer from a crypto-drainer attack              Swift action is essential if you suspect your crypto wallet has been compromised. Though fund recovery is rare, quick action can limit further losses.Here are the steps you need to take if you suffer from a crypto DaaS attack:Secure your accounts: Immediately change the password for your wallet and enable 2FA, if you still have access to it. Transfer any remaining funds to a secure, uncompromised wallet.Notify your wallet provider or exchange: Report the incident to your wallet provider or exchange. You could request them to monitor your account or freeze suspicious activity. Platforms may flag suspicious addresses or prevent further transfers.File a report with authorities: Contact local law enforcement or cybercrime units, as cryptocurrency theft is treated as a financial crime in most regions.Seek professional assistance: Cybersecurity firms specializing in blockchain forensics can analyze transactions and potentially trace the stolen funds. While full recovery is unlikely, especially if assets pass through mixers or bridges, expert help may aid investigations.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/crypto-drainers-as-a-service-what-you-need-to-know?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The team claimed to have immediately responded and taken action involving multiple departments, including the firm’s chief operating officer, Helen Liu.Other people involved in the operation were the heads of customer service, risk control, the Chinese-language division, product managers and the technical team. The exchange coordinated its actions with the user.After an internal investigation, Bybit concluded this was a “unique case affecting an individual user, not a systemic issue.” The account’s KYC information was not tampered with and the funds in the account remained secure at all times.Bybit had not answered Cointelegraph’s request for comment at the time of writing.Related: A decade-old debate is back as self-custody gets smarterThe perks of media attentionBybit claims to have taken large-scale and timely action, which involved a member of its executive team, all in response to an issue reported by a single user.

They highlighted:“This incident really made me feel the value of having influence.”EnHeng said “in this market, retail investors often lack a voice and are vulnerable.” For this reason, he said, “When we have more resources and a bigger voice, we should use them to speak up for retail investors.”Related: Self-custody vs. centralized crypto cards: Freedom or convenience?Locked out of exchangeBeing locked out of a cryptocurrency exchange account or some of its features is not excessively uncommon.

Indian cryptocurrency exchange Mudrex temporarily halted crypto withdrawals during the same month, claiming compliance improvements were the reason.Sometimes action is taken on the request of law enforcement. Last summer, a small set of Palestinian user accounts was frozen after Israeli authorities issued a seizure request. Also last summer, OKX warned it would terminate any account linked to crypto mixer Tornado Cash or sanctioned addresses, and several users said their log-ins were suddenly disabled.Those incidents echo an old adage popular in the Bitcoin (BTC) community: Not your keys, not your coins.

2025-05-19T07:55:20.000Z,"Vitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes for Ethereum scaling","Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin unveiled a proposal to preserve trustless, censorship-resistant access to Ethereum, even as the network scales. On May 19, Buterin shared a post outlining how to make Ethereum's layer-1 scaling “more friendly” to users running local nodes for personal use. The Ethereum co-founder highlighted the importance of independent users running nodes, saying that a market dominated by a few Remote Procedure Call (RPC) providers risks censorship. RPC providers let wallets, users and apps interact with the blockchain without running their own nodes. Crypto wallets are usually connected to an RPC provider behind the scenes. Buterin believes there are risks to this setup. “A market structure dominated by a few RPC providers is one that will face strong pressure to deplatform or censor users. Many RPC providers already exclude entire countries,” Buterin wrote. Source: Vitalik ButerinVitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes In addition to censorship, Buterin argued that reasons like expensive fully-trustless cryptographic solutions and metadata privacy show that there’s value in ensuring greater ease for those running a personal node. In the proposal, Buterin's solution relies on a novel type of node called “partially stateless nodes.” These nodes are designed to help users maintain privacy-preserving access to blockchain data without the heavy resource demands of running a full node. As Ethereum scales and the gas limit increases, running a full node requires more storage and bandwidth. Buterin said partially stateless nodes address the issue by allowing users to verify the blockchain and serve local data, but only store a subset of the Ethereum state, based on the user’s needs.Vitalik Buterin’s graphic of partially stateless nodes. Source: Vitalik ButerinRelated: Ethereum Foundation unveils security initiative to supplant legacy systemsA new node type to validate blocks “statelessly”The nodes would operate by validating blocks statelessly. This means they don't require the storage of the full Merkle proofs or the entire blockchain history. They can selectively keep certain parts of the state up to date. This means that users could configure their nodes only to save data related to their accounts, the decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, and their commonly used tokens like stablecoins and Ether (ETH). The rest of the data will be left out, and queries beyond the stored subset will fail or be routed through an RPC solution. Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/vitalik-buterin-partially-stateless-nodes-ethereum-scaling-privacy?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-19T07:38:51.000Z,"How to read a Bitcoin liquidation map (without getting liquidated)","Understanding a Bitcoin liquidation map is imperative in dealing with the inherent volatility of the crypto market. The visual tool showcases probable liquidation levels, indicating where large orders may cause cascading price changes. This post explores how to interpret a Bitcoin liquidation map, allowing you to trade smarter in the volatile world of cryptocurrency.What is liquidation in crypto trading?In cryptocurrency trading, liquidation happens when an exchange forcefully closes a trader's leveraged position due to insufficient margin to pay losses. This usually occurs when the market moves sharply against the position. Long liquidations occur when prices fall, affecting traders who bet on an uptrend. Short liquidations happen when prices unexpectedly rise, impacting those who bet on a decline. Did you know? In crypto, a single liquidation cascade can wipe out millions in minutes, triggered not by hacking but by traders using too much leverage at the wrong time.What is a Bitcoin liquidation map?A Bitcoin liquidation map is a visual heatmap indicating price levels where large liquidations are expected to occur. These maps assist traders in identifying zones where leveraged positions may be closed forcibly if prices fluctuate sharply. Tools like CoinGlass provide real-time Bitcoin (BTC) liquidation maps, valuable resources for risk-aware traders. With the liquidation map, you canUse breakout trading strategies for profitable scalping opportunities.Set stop-loss levels based on key liquidation zones for better risk management.Target high-liquidity areas to secure profits efficiently.Enter large trades near liquidity clusters to minimize slippage and enhance execution.Analyze the gradient of liquidation intensity to anticipate potential price movements..Functioning of a liquidation map and key components The X-axis of the liquidation chart represents the bid price, while the Y-axis denotes the relative strength of liquidation activity. Each column on the graphic illustrates a liquidation cluster's relative significance compared to other clusters.The chart demonstrates how the market will respond if the price reaches certain thresholds. Taller liquidation bars indicate a higher potential impact. The various hues are solely for visual clarity, allowing users to distinguish between distinct liquidation zones.Here are the main components of a liquidation map:Heat zones: Indicate where most positions could be eliminated if the price reaches specific levels.Liquidity pools: Collections of stop-loss and liquidation orders that can cause rapid price movements.Open interest levels: Demonstrate where large amounts of leveraged positions are concentrated.Price imbalances or gaps: Disclose areas without support or resistance, allowing prices to move swiftly.Did you know? Crypto liquidations often follow the herd; when too many traders place similar bets, liquidation maps light up and whales use them as price targets.How to use a liquidation map in your Bitcoin trading strategyA Bitcoin liquidation map provides insights into probable price movements and risk zones by visually representing places where leveraged positions will likely be closed. Here is how to use a liquidation map in Bitcoin trading:Identify high-risk zones: Identify places with dense liquidation clusters to avoid overleveraging. These areas come across as magnets, attracting price changes that might cause a series of liquidations.Time entry and exit: Liquidation clusters help find the optimal entry and exit points. Entering and exiting trades before a cluster becomes risky helps you lock in profits before reversals.Combine with technical indicators: Enhance your research by combining liquidation maps with tools such as support/resistance levels and relative strength index (RSI). This sets out a comprehensive view of market conditions.Avoid herd mentality: Exercise caution in places with high leverage concentrations. Such zones may be traps constructed by larger players to induce liquidations and profit from the resulting volatility.Monitor whale activity: Large traders frequently target liquidation zones to turn price moves to their advantage. Observing these patterns can provide insights about prospective market movements.Anticipate reversals: Markets frequently experience reversals following large liquidation events. Recognizing these trends can aid in positioning for possible rebounds.Implement robust risk management: Use stop-loss orders and handle leverage carefully. Liquidation maps can help you determine where to put these orders to minimize exposure.Common mistakes to avoid when using the Bitcoin liquidation mapUsing a Bitcoin liquidation map can enhance trading decisions, but misinterpretation can lead to costly errors. Here are common mistakes you need to avoid:Blindly trading toward liquidity zones: If you are trading toward liquidity zones without thinking, expect reversals.Misreading map colors or scale: Making a mistake in judging map colors or scale can skew your risk assessment.Over-relying on liquidation data without context: Maps are valuable tools, not an assurance that what they reflect will happen.Ignoring macro news or sentiment analysis: External events often override technical signals. A sudden event may make all predictions fall flat.Always combine liquidation maps with broader technical analysis. Smart trading requires context, not just colorful charts.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Source: PACERCoinbase reported on May 15 that four days earlier it had been hit with a $20 million extortion attempt after cybercriminals bribed several of its customer support agents to access internal systems and steal a limited amount of user account data.The stolen data included names, addresses, phone numbers, emails, the last four digits of Social Security numbers, some bank account identifiers, driver’s licenses, passports and some account data, such as balance snapshots and transaction history.Bender claimed that “Coinbase failed to implement and maintain reasonable security safeguards,” which exposed users to “serious and ongoing risks.”The suit also claimed Coinbase’s response to the incident was “inadequate, fragmented, and delayed.”“Users were not promptly or fully informed of the compromise, and Coinbase did not immediately take meaningful steps to mitigate further harm,  provide identity protection services, or offer actionable guidance to affected individuals,” the complaint claimed.The lawsuit claimed users could face “substantial, immediate, and ongoing threat of identity theft and financial fraud” and that the consequences of the breach could be long-term or “potentially permanent” because the compromised information can’t be recovered or made secure once exposed.Flurry of lawsuits make similar allegations Two other lawsuits filed in a New York federal court made similar claims against Coinbase, while a fourth lawsuit added the allegation of unjust enrichment, arguing that Coinbase didn’t spend enough on data security measures.All four complaints ask for damages and other measures to help protect the plaintiff’s sensitive data.Meanwhile, a fifth lawsuit filed in a California federal court on May 15 made similar claims against Coinbase, but asked the court to order Coinbase to purge all sensitive data it holds about the plaintiffs and hire third-party security auditors to test its security systems, among other requests.A Coinbase spokesperson did not comment on the lawsuits and instead pointed Cointelegraph to a blog post it shared regarding the data breaches.Coinbase said it refused to pay the $20 million ransom and has flagged plans to reimburse users tricked into sending crypto to phishing scammers due to the data breach.In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the exchange said it expects reimbursement expenses ranging from $180 million to $400 million.Related: Retired artist loses $2M in crypto to Coinbase impersonatorThe exchange also reportedly fired a group of customer support agents based in India following their alleged involvement in social engineering attacks on users.Coinbase (COIN) shares dipped 7% and dropped to $244 after it disclosed the data breach along with an ongoing SEC probe over misstated user numbers in 2021.The stock has since staged a comeback, spiking 9% and hitting $266 by the closing bell on May 16, according to Google Finance. Coinbase has climbed even higher following the data breach.

Bitcoin developer John Carvalho introduced Bitcoin Improvement Proposal-177 on April 23, which seeks to eliminate the concept of satoshis, of which there are 100,000,000 in 1 Bitcoin (BTC), and effectively split Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million into 21 quadrillion units.It follows a 2017 proposal from Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song to create “bits,” representing one-millionth of 1 Bitcoin.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewBoth moving averages are sloping up, and the relative strength index (RSI) is in the overbought zone, signaling that the buyers hold the edge.

2025-05-18T15:00:00.000Z,"Don’t believe the noise: There can never be too many L2s","Opinion by: Igor Mandrigin, co-founder and CTPO of Gateway.fmEvery couple of weeks, it seems another layer 2 rolls out, much to the chagrin of some Web3 industry commentators who are concerned about fragmentation. A recent Gemini Institutional Insights report actually noted how a new Ethereum L2 solution is launched approximately every 19 days. In response to the seemingly endless conveyor belt of new zkEVMs and optimistic rollups coming to market, the chorus of criticism continues to grow louder: “This is definitely the saturation point, no more chains are needed.”Some of the most outspoken critics of L2s argue that L2s are redundant, but this is narrow thinking. In many ways, the idea that creating new L2s should be slowed down is like arguing that there were too many websites in 1998. The proliferation of L2s is not causing the Web3 space to become overly bloated or fragmented at all. The number of chains today isn’t too many. It’s laughably few, and right now is the early innings of a multi-decade explosion in specialized, modular blockchain infrastructure.The rise of L2s is far from a passing fadWhile some contend that this L2 surge we’ve been experiencing is merely a temporary frenzy led by DeFi degenerates, it’s really an enterprise-grade infrastructure expansion, as banks (including Deutsche Bank), game studios (gaming activity on some L2 blockchains rose by over 20,000% in February 2025), logistics networks and global manufacturers get on board. Industries like banking and logistics, which are typically risk-averse, don’t make major tech pivots lightly. They do so because they have to, and in many cases, public blockchains do not meet their needs. Returning to their inherent risk-averse DNA, large enterprises and institutions in these sectors generally won’t want to build on shared, general-purpose L1s. Instead, they’ll want to deploy their own chains where they can enjoy custom performance, predictable costs, jurisdictional compliance and granular-level privacy.This focus on proprietary networks isn’t solely a Web3 thing. Let’s think about it. Did Facebook, Netflix and JPMorgan co-host on GeoCities? Of course not, so why would Web3 be any different? Shared L1s and monolithic architectures might have worked for early token experiments and composable DeFi primitives. Still, realistically, they can’t support real-world businesses’ complexity, regulatory burden or contractual requirements.The growing viability of L2sThanks to modular stacks, rollup-as-a-service platforms and breakthrough zero-knowledge proof technology, spinning up a dedicated chain is becoming increasingly viable and accessible to a wide range of enterprises across the industry spectrum. As the infrastructure improves, the cost of launching and maintaining specialized chains will also reduce, so a substantial rise in the number of L2s can be expected as time goes on.Recent: Devs introduce Ethereum R1 layer-2 scaling solutionSome onlookers will argue that this future will be convoluted for users forced to hop between chains while voicing concerns about liquidity fragmentation and the dispersal of tradable assets across multiple platforms. These are short-sighted concerns. We’re building toward seamless interoperability through shared settlement layers, trust-minimized bridges and unified account abstraction. Ultimately, the end-user won’t care whether they’re on rollup #4,318 or chain #9,072; they’ll just transact with ease and be happy with that. In the same way that cloud computing unlocked hyper scale by abstracting the hardware layer, modular blockchains are unlocking hyperscale for value transfer, asset issuance and programmable trust. Irrespective of what the doubters say, specialized L2s won’t cannibalize each other. They’ll serve different verticals, jurisdictions and use cases. There is no reason why an L2 for high-frequency trading can’t easily coexist with an L2 for national land registries.We’re not drowning in chains — we’re barely ankle-deep in the grand scheme of things. Anyone seriously betting on consolidation or some magical “winner-take-all” chain is just betting against scale and sovereignty. The real bet is hundreds of L2s and thousands of use cases as part of one modular, scalable future.Opinion by: Igor Mandrigin, co-founder and CTPO of Gateway.fm.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-18T09:40:57.000Z,"‘Bitcoin Standard’ author backs funding dev to make spamming Bitcoin costly","Economist and author of The Bitcoin Standard, Saifedean Ammous, has weighed in on the ongoing debate over spam inscriptions on the Bitcoin network, suggesting he would “throw in a few sats” to fund a full-time developer focused on making Bitcoin spamming more difficult and expensive.Ammous made the remarks in response to a thread initiated by the pseudonymous developer GrassFedBitcoin, who called for Bitcoin Core to merge pull request #28408, which would enable node operators to filter inscriptions more easily.According to GrassFedBitcoin, the lack of inscription filtering tools contributes to unnecessary blockchain bloat and undermines Bitcoin (BTC)’s role as a monetary protocol.“No one running a node wants to relay inscriptions,” he wrote, arguing that the OP_RETURN limit increases were justified in the past under false assumptions. He pushed for a configurable, default policy discouraging the use of Bitcoin for storing JPEGs rather than monetary data.Blockstream CEO Adam Back challenged the proposal, describing inscription filtering as an “arms race.” He noted that spam data embedded in Bitcoin transactions can be endlessly modified using code structures, requiring constant updates to filtering tools.Source: Adam BackRelated: Bitcoin Ordinals vs. Ethereum NFTs: A comparative overviewAmmous compares Bitcoin spam to emailAmmous compared the Bitcoin spam issue to email spam — another arms race society continues to fight without abandoning the system.“It’s not easy, but it’s worth trying to help bankrupt the spammers faster,” Ammous said. He argued that fighting spam is not censorship, noting that node operators already reject invalid transactions.“So a node runner looking to remove retards' spam is no less valid than retards' spam,” he added.The debate drew commentary from other users. One participant suggested Core developers treat spam-coding employees at certain startups as “unwilling QA engineers” and simply unstandardize every trick they deploy.Ammous took it further, proposing to “deprecate” the work of developers building spam tools and even hiring outside coders to overwhelm their systems.Source: Saifedean AmmousThe conversation reflects ongoing tensions in the Bitcoin community over the network’s intended use. With inscriptions continuing to congest the network, calls for technical countermeasures — and pointed critiques of those defending spam — are growing louder.In a Feb. 4 report, Mempool Research said the adoption of inscriptions could drive the Bitcoin network’s average block size as high as 4 megabytes (MB) per block, far higher than current averages.Bitcoin’s average block size — the amount of data in each block posted to the network’s public ledger — is currently around 1.5 MB.Magazine: Arthur Hayes $1M Bitcoin tip, altcoins’ powerful rally’ looms: Hodler’s Digest, May 11 – 17",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/saifedean-ammous-funds-dev-to-fight-bitcoin-spam?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

But in March, Suman received a text message appearing to be from Coinbase, warning him of unauthorized account access.After responding, he got a phone call from a man identifying himself as a Coinbase security staffer named Brett Miller. The caller appeared knowledgeable, correctly stating that Suman’s funds were stored in a hardware wallet.He then convinced Suman that his wallet could still be vulnerable and walked him through a “security procedure” that involved entering his seed phrase into a website mimicking Coinbase’s interface.Nine days later, a second caller claiming to be from Coinbase repeated the process.

2025-05-17T15:21:23.000Z,"A Bitcoiner’s guide to South Africa’s Garden Route","South Africa’s Garden Route, famed for its lush forests, expansive beaches and charming towns, has become a testbed for Bitcoin adoption.From Mossel Bay to Witsand and Plettenberg Bay to Knysna, Bitcoin has become popular among shop owners and travelers alike for a multitude of reasons.“We’re seeing the early signs of a parallel, permissionless economy emerging across an entire region,” James Caw, founder of SimplB — a local crypto asset provider — told Cointelegraph, “where small businesses benefit from faster, lower-cost digital payments and where people have more options to earn, send and receive sound money securely.”For tourists, the benefits are immediate: no currency exchange hassles, no international card fees, and the ability to pay instantly and securely. For locals, Bitcoin (BTC) offers a hedge against inflation, protection from currency volatility and new economic opportunities.Here’s a taste of what a Bitcoin-friendly trip along the Garden Route is like.The Garden Route is where Bitcoin meets paradiseThe Garden Route is one of South Africa’s premier tourist corridors. It stretches roughly 300 kilometers from Mossel Bay in the west to the Storms River Mouth in the east, attracting hundreds of thousands of tourists yearly.Crypto adoption is escalating thanks to South Africa’s regulatory environment, which now recognizes Bitcoin as a financial product. Across the Garden Route, you can spend pre-acquired Bitcoin freely, with little concern for local tax or exchange controls.It’s a grassroots movement. Towns like Witsand and Plettenberg Bay are at the forefront, and national retailers like Pick n Pay provide a safety net for crypto spending along the way. Every Pick n Pay store, including supermarkets, clothing outlets and Express convenience stores, accepts Bitcoin via the CryptoQR app. This guarantees you can always buy daily goods with Bitcoin wherever you travel. Related: Stablecoin fever: 5 major stablecoins are growing crypto adoptionWitsand is the Bitcoin villageLocated at the mouth of the Breede River, Witsand is a sleepy coastal town with a big reputation in the Bitcoin world. Here, Bitcoin isn’t just accepted — it’s preferred.It’s thanks to the efforts of local champions like Edwin Jones, a software engineer and passionate supporter of Bitcoin adoption in the Garden Route. Witsand has become a functioning Bitcoin circular economy. Accommodation options like Fantasea and Happy Days holiday homes, meals at Ellie’s on Main, groceries at local shops, gym memberships, boat services, petrol, surf lessons and mini-golf can be paid for using Bitcoin.As Jones notes: Bitcoin Witsand existed long before we gave it a name. It was just having conversations with friends, and as the local businesses started understanding Bitcoin, they actually demanded we start getting the technology in place.The town’s small and close-knit community has enabled rapid adoption; more than 45 establishments accept Bitcoin as of early 2025. The town’s enthusiasm is infectious, as locals and visitors enjoy the ease and security of digital payments.Witsand proudly announces its acceptance of Bitcoin. Source: Edwin JonesWitsand’s success as a Bitcoin hub is rooted in its community-driven approach. Jones outlines its growth by outlining that: Although there have been many individual businesses over the years since 2009 that started and stopped accepting Bitcoin for the Garden Route, the adoption really started kicking off in 2021.“With the Lightning Network starting to reach maturity around that time, the first Spaza Shop in Mossel Bay, Bitcoin Ekasi, started accepting Bitcoin in August 2021, and the first restaurant in Witsand in December of the same year.”Education has been central to the process. Local advocates have focused on teaching business owners the fundamentals of Bitcoin, warning against scams and emphasizing the difference between Bitcoin and speculative altcoins. “With all the circular economies advocating against gambling and trading, cautioning against interest and investments, being explicitly Bitcoin, and focusing on the fundamentals rather than the price, scammers have been kept at bay,” Jones said. “We have also found that businesses don’t have to adapt as much as evolve.”Bitcoin doesn’t change a business — it just supercharges it. Doing the same old things, much better.Mossel Bay’s surf and social upliftmentMossel Bay, the historical gateway to the Garden Route, is not just about beaches and maritime history. Mossel Bay is home to Bitcoin Ekasi, a pioneering project that brought Bitcoin to the township of JCC Camp.Bitcoin Ekasi empowers unbanked residents by enabling them to earn and spend Bitcoin locally. Coaches at The Surfer Kids nonprofit are paid in Bitcoin, and local spaza shops accept Bitcoin for daily necessities.For the Bitcoiner tourist, Mossel Bay offers a unique opportunity for “conscious crypto-tourism.” You can take surf lessons from instructors paid in Bitcoin, visit the Bitcoin Ekasi education center, or support the project with direct donations.The town also boasts a Pick n Pay that accepts Bitcoin. As SimplB’s Caw observes: The Bitcoin Ekasi project first started when they began accepting Bitcoin because of the demand from foreign tourists visiting Mossel Bay. It is just so simple to function on a Bitcoin standard once you begin using it.Plettenberg Bay is the fastest-growing Bitcoin economyFurther east, Plettenberg Bay has witnessed an explosion in Bitcoin adoption. In just a few months, the number of Bitcoin-accepting merchants jumped from five to more than 75, making it one of Africa’s most dynamic crypto economies.Confirmed acceptors include Ferris Cars (which facilitates rental accommodation payments in crypto), Glow Lighting Design and all local Pick n Pay branches. Adventure tourism companies, boutique retailers and professional services are increasingly receptive to Bitcoin, especially if you ask. The rapid growth suggests an enthusiastic local scene, with businesses eager to tap into the spending power of Bitcoin tourists.Related: 8 major crypto firms announce US expansion this yearPlettenberg Bay offers a vibrant mix of beach life, nature and crypto-friendly commerce. The town’s energy is palpable, and visitors are encouraged to engage with merchants, share information about Lightning payments, and help grow the ecosystem.“Right now Plettenberg Bay is by far the most interesting circular economy in Africa and possibly the world,” said Jones. “It currently boasts having the most businesses accepting Bitcoin of any town in Africa and has achieved this in less than three months.”Bitcoin preferred signs can be found along the Garden Route. Source: Edwin JonesSedgefield is a quiet pioneerSedgefield, a tranquil town between Knysna and Wilderness, played a key role in the national rollout of Bitcoin payments at Pick n Pay. It was one of the trial sites for the innovative QR code converter from MoneyBadger, which enables Bitcoin spending at every Pick n Pay in South Africa.Sedgefield itself doesn’t have the same density of Bitcoin-accepting independent merchants as Witsand or Plettenberg Bay, but the presence of Pick n Pay ensures that crypto tourists can always pay for groceries and essentials with sats.Practical information for your tripIf you do make it out to the Garden Route, recommended wallets include Blink, Wallet of Satoshi and Phoenix — all Lightning-enabled and widely used in the region. In larger towns like Knysna, George, Wilderness and Oudtshoorn, the Bitcoin scene is still emerging. There aren’t yet established circular economies, but the nationwide acceptance of Bitcoin at Pick n Pay provides a reliable foundation for spending.The Spasie on Breede Restaurant and Bar is just one of many establishments accepting Bitcoin. Source: Edwin JonesBTC Map occasionally lists independent merchants, like Beans About Coffee in Oudtshoorn. Still, the best strategy is to ask around, look for Bitcoin signage, and use mapping tools to discover new acceptors.For accommodation, activities and dining, direct inquiry remains key. Many guesthouses and tour operators are open to Bitcoin payments, especially as awareness grows. Online platforms like Bitrefill enable you to buy gift vouchers for major retailers using Bitcoin, providing a workaround for places that don’t yet accept crypto directly.Happy travels.Magazine: Pranksy: Inside the anonymous life of an NFT legend — NFT Collector",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoiners-guide-south-africa-garden-route?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-17T15:00:00.000Z,"The DeFi mullet — Fintech needs DeFi in the back","Opinion by: Merlin Egalite, co-founder at Morpho LabsFintechs in the front, decentralized finance (DeFi) in the back: the DeFi Mullet.Today’s fintech companies offer excellent user experiences but are constrained by traditional financial infrastructure — siloed, slow, expensive and inflexible. Meanwhile, DeFi provides lightning-fast, cost-effective, interoperable infrastructure but lacks mainstream accessibility.The solution? Combine fintech’s distribution and user experience with DeFi’s efficient back end.The mullet is inevitableFintech companies heavily rely on traditional financial (TradFi) infrastructure that is siloed, slow to deploy and run, and costly to maintain. This inefficiency limits their control over costs and product offerings and has potential infrastructure risks. Fintechs have a strong incentive to transition to building on autonomous, credibly neutral public infrastructure.The power of DeFi is evident in stablecoins. While traditional international wire transfers cost $30–$50 and take one to five business days, stablecoin transfers cost mere cents and settle in seconds. This revolutionary improvement in financial infrastructure extends beyond payments. DeFi provides 24/7/365 infrastructure for trading, lending and borrowing with instant settlement, open access and deep liquidity, enabling better price execution and yields.Plugging their compliance-ready front end into DeFi infrastructure, fintech companies can focus on creating exceptional user experiences. This opens up tremendous opportunities for innovation while driving more liquidity onchain, creating a positive feedback loop of embracing the DeFi Mullet.Now is the time for mainstream adoptionToday’s DeFi ecosystem has proven its reliability for fintech integration. There are dozens of protocols that demonstrate this maturity, securely managing billions in loans through immutable, governance-minimized designs. DeFi infrastructure gives fintechs complete control over their infrastructure. This is particularly crucial after the recent Synapse bankruptcy that trapped Yotta user funds meant to be insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.Recent: Bitcoin DeFi will have 300M users, beating Ethereum and Solana: ExecInstitutions are also coming onchain. BlackRock has tokenized a fund via Securitize; Stripe has acquired Bridge for $1 billion to scale its stablecoin solutions; the US is creating a strategic Bitcoin (BTC) reserve; and clarity on regulation is opening the floodgates. The shift is step-by-step but tangible.DeFi has arrived.The next phaseFor years to come, expect more products like crypto-backed loans to be released by fintech’s most advanced players, offering onchain saving accounts, onchain loans, instant international payments and more. This transformation will be invisible to users and powered by smart wallets and account abstraction that maintain the familiar Web2-like user experience at which fintech companies excel. Early adopters will gain significant advantages over competitors.Yet, unlike building on traditional finance, DeFi’s open infrastructure means even latecomers can benefit from existing network effects without starting from zero.Some skeptics argue that the involvement of fintechs and traditional institutions will erode decentralization, as protocols must comply with regulatory requirements. While this concern is understandable, the opposite is more likely.Expecting protocols to achieve compliance across every jurisdiction worldwide is unrealistic, especially given the vast regulatory fragmentation. Instead, regulating the apps that interface with users makes far more sense rather than the underlying protocols. For this regulatory model to work, however, protocols must remain credibly neutral.A credibly neutral mechanism adheres to four principles:It embeds no preference for specific individuals or outcomes.It is open-source with publicly verifiable execution.It is simple and understandable.It changes infrequently.Examples like HTTP and SMTP demonstrate the power of credibly neutral protocols — they are free, open and unregulated, with only the clients subject to oversight. The same logic should apply to governance-minimized, immutable DeFi protocols.These constraints will push DeFi builders toward creating genuinely decentralized and trustless systems.Fintechs integrating DeFi protocols can build on top of the most neutral infrastructure and access their growing network effects.Let the mullet growThe DeFi mullet is more than just a meme — it’s a structural shift.To scale, DeFi must meet users where they are: through regulated, user-friendly fintech channels. For fintechs to stay relevant, they must offer their customers the best user experience and opportunities, such as the best rates. Those who miss this opportunity risk falling into irrelevance, much like traditional retail banks losing market share to today’s fintechs.This convergence isn’t just possible — it’s inevitable.Opinion by: Merlin Egalite, co-founder at Morpho Labs.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-17T12:09:46.000Z,"Bitcoin to $250K in 2025 ‘totally possible’ — crypto analyst Scott Melker","Bitcoin’s next explosive move could send the asset to $250,000 by the end of 2025, according to Scott Melker, a crypto analyst and host of The Wolf of All Streets podcast.Speaking in a recent interview, Melker cited growing institutional interest and diminishing volatility as key factors that could drive the next leg up.“250K this year, totally possible,” Melker said, adding that Bitcoin (BTC)’s volatility has declined significantly in recent years.“It used to be about three times as volatile as the S&P. Now it’s less than two times.” He pointed to increased involvement from pension funds and ETF issuers as evidence of a more mature, stable market.The shift, he argued, reflects a broader trend of institutional adoption. “The more institutional money, the more Wall Street money, the more long-term holders get involved, the less volatility there’s going to be,” Melker explained.Related: New Bitcoin price all-time highs could occur in MayCrypto markets show signs of strength in 2025Market activity in 2025 has already shown signs of strength. Bitcoin surged past $104,000, while Ether (ETH) reclaimed levels above $2,600.Coinbase’s addition to the S&P 500 marked a major milestone for crypto’s integration into mainstream finance. Melker noted the company is not just entering the index but doing so in the top 50 by market cap — a reflection of how deeply rooted some crypto firms have become.In addition to Coinbase, firms like Galaxy Digital and eToro have moved forward with public listings, signaling confidence in regulatory conditions under the current US administration.Melker said that this environment, bolstered by dropped SEC lawsuits and favorable executive orders, has created what he calls “an extremely bullish” backdrop for the sector.While Bitcoin remains the primary focus, Melker acknowledged a renewed interest in altcoins. Recent price action saw Ethereum outpace Bitcoin, triggering a rally across smaller-cap tokens — a sign, he said, that “new money” is entering the space rather than just rotating within it.Related: Here is why Bitcoin price is stuck below $105KDon’t rule out a wild runDespite the optimism, Melker tempered expectations, noting that most experts are forecasting cycle highs between $120,000 and $150,000. Still, he emphasized that wild surges are not out of the ordinary in crypto.“From the 2020 lows to the last bull market, Bitcoin went from $3,000 to $69,000. A 2.5x from here wouldn’t be a big deal.”On May 16, X analytics account Apsk32 argued that Bitcoin has a “decent chance” of hitting $250,000 or more in 2025 as attention turns to gold copycat moves.Source: Apsk32On April 28, Peter Chung, head of research at quantitative trading firm Presto, also repeated his prediction that Bitcoin will reach $210,000 by the end of 2025.On April 22, analysts from Standard Chartered and Intellectia AI said institutional Bitcoin demand from exchange-traded funds and traders seeking to hedge against macroeconomic risk could cause Bitcoin’s price to more than double this year.Magazine: Binance Wallet ‘killing’ MetaMask and airdrops, Chinese RWA tokens: Asia Express",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-250k-2025-melker?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-17T09:12:28.000Z,"Everstake defends non-custodial staking as SEC weighs industry input","The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has held discussions with Everstake, one of the largest non-custodial staking providers globally, to explore clearer regulatory definitions around staking in blockchain networks.The meeting, which also involved the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, comes at a time when over $193 billion in digital assets are staked across major proof-of-stake (PoS) networks.However, despite the massive scale of participation, staking remains in a legal gray zone in the US as regulators wrestle with its classification under existing securities law.The previous SEC administration also took enforcement actions against major players such as Kraken, Coinbase, and Consensys due to their staking services. The agency, under pro-crypto President Donald Trump, has recently dismissed these enforcement actions.During the meeting, Everstake told the SEC that non-custodial staking should not be classified as a securities transaction. The company said that users maintain full control over their digital assets throughout the staking process and do not transfer ownership to a third party.They argued that this makes staking a technical function, not an investment product.“Our main assertion is that staking is not a financial instrument or security transaction, but rather a technical process, a base-layer protocol mechanism—akin to an oracle in a database—that maintains the integrity and functionality of decentralized networks,” Everstake founder Sergii Vasylchuk told Cointelegraph.Everstake team meeting with the SEC. Source: EverstakeRelated: SEC delays staking decision for Grayscale ETH ETFsEverstake calls for regulatory clarityIn a letter submitted to the SEC’s Crypto Task Force on April 8, 2025, Everstake asked the agency to extend regulatory clarity to non-custodial staking and custodial and liquid staking models.In the letter, which came in respond to Commissioner Hester Peirce’s call for input on regulatory treatment of blockchain services, Everstake argued that non-custodial staking should not be considered a securities offering.It claimed that non-custodial staking, where users retain control of their tokens, does not involve the pooling of assets or the expectation of profits from managerial efforts.In its model, Everstake said users delegate only validation rights while maintaining ownership of their digital assets. The staking rewards are algorithmically distributed by the blockchain network itself, and the firm merely provides technical infrastructure.Related: Ethereum ETF staking will have little impact without multimonth rally: AnalystNon-custodial staking fails the Howey testThe letter also details why non-custodial staking fails each prong of the Howey test. Users do not make an investment of money in a common enterprise, do not expect profits from Everstake’s efforts, and are not dependent on the company’s management for financial returns.Instead, any rewards come from network-level incentives and fluctuate with the market value of the underlying asset.Everstake proposes specific criteria that should exempt non-custodial staking from securities classification. These include user asset control, absence of pooled funds, permissionless unstaking, and the provision of purely technical services.It likens non-custodial staking to proof-of-work mining, which the SEC has previously ruled out as a securities transaction.Margaret Rosenfeld, Everstake’s chief legal officer, also told Cointelegraph that “with non-custodial staking, there’s no handover of assets, no investment contract, and no third-party risk.” She added:“Treating it as a securities offering undermines the decentralized model and risks chilling innovation in the blockchain sector.”Nevertheless, the SEC has so far withheld a definitive stance. Rosenfeld said that the agency did not make any “specific commitments” on staking guidance. However, it continues to listen to industry stakeholders.“The Task Force is actively engaging with a range of stakeholders—including those involved with non-custodial staking, ETFs, and broader blockchain infrastructure—to gather input.”In an April 30 letter to the SEC, nearly 30 crypto advocate groups led by the lobby group the Crypto Council for Innovation (CCI) asked the agency for clear regulatory guidance on crypto staking and staking services.Magazine: Binance Wallet ‘killing’ MetaMask and airdrops, Chinese RWA tokens: Asia Express",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/everstake-defends-non-everstake-sec-non-custodial-staking-guidance-staking-as-sec-weighs-industry-input?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
