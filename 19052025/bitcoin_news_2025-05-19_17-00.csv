2025-05-19T14:46:53.000Z,"XRP Death Cross Alert: XRP About to Fail Against Bitcoin Big Time","The XRP/BTC trading pair is currently flashing a significant technical indicator that suggests XRP may be losing traction compared to Bitcoin. A recent development on the daily chart has revealed a potential bearish pattern, signaling that XRP’s momentum could be tapering off. Death Cross Formation: A Bearish Signal A significant technical indicator is the emergence of a death cross. This occurs when a shorter-term moving average crosses beneath a longer-term moving average, often indicating a bearish shift. In this case, the 23-day moving average has dipped below the 200-day moving average, highlighting that XRP’s upward momentum might be losing strength. This crossover typically signals a downturn, hinting at potential challenges for XRP in maintaining its previous bullish stance. Source: TradingView Struggling at Bollinger Bands Resistance Adding to the bearish sentiment, XRP/BTC recently encountered resistance at the midline of the Bollinger Bands. Typically, this central band serves as a point of equilibrium, but XRP’s inability to break through indicates a struggle to regain higher ground. The failure to overcome this resistance level underscores the ongoing weakness in the pair, suggesting that XRP might continue to lag behind Bitcoin. Volume Fails to Support a Rebound Volume analysis further supports the notion of XRP’s waning strength. Despite an earlier price surge this month, trading activity has since cooled, with volume levels failing to surge sufficiently to back a bullish reversal. The candles on the chart are clustering just above the short-term support, indicating a consolidation phase rather than a strong recovery. This muted volume response hints that market participants may not be confident enough to fuel a sustained upward move.

For XRP to regain its footing against BTC, it must decisively break above the current resistance zone. If this doesn’t happen, Bitcoin may remain favored, and XRP could face a tough road ahead. The coming trading sessions will be critical in determining whether XRP can mount a comeback or continue to falter against its dominant counterpart.

2025-05-19T14:41:08.000Z,"The Giant Company That Switched From Bitcoin Mining to Artificial Intelligence Sector Is Experiencing Its Own Bull! Here Are the Details","A new report by fintech and crypto research firm Rittenhouse Research cited Galaxy Digital’s transition from Bitcoin mining to artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure as the top reason for its “strong buy” rating on the company’s stock. Galaxy Digital’s AI Pivot, Not Bitcoin Mining, Is Its Biggest Bull Case, Rittenhouse Research Says While Galaxy Digital was once a major player in Bitcoin (BTC) mining, its 2022 acquisition of the Helios data center from troubled miner Argo Blockchain may have unexpectedly positioned the company as a major infrastructure provider in the burgeoning AI economy. At the time of the acquisition, the move was seen as a lifeline for a struggling crypto miner. But the rapid rise of productive AI platforms like ChatGPT has turned the demand for high-performance data centers into a gold rush, and Galaxy appears to be sitting on one of the most valuable assets in the space. “Galaxy stumbled upon Helios by chance,” Rittenhouse wrote in a recent investment note. The firm believes the data center, now dedicated to serving AI customers, could generate $1.7 billion in EBITDA and $32 billion in equity value in the near term. While the crypto industry remains volatile due to BTC mining being subject to periodic outages and constant equipment upgrades, AI data centers typically offer stable, high-margin returns through triple-net leases with large-scale cloud computing customers. Rittenhouse argues that this contrast in business models makes it a strategic advantage for Galaxy to exit mining entirely. “Galaxy has completely exited all Bitcoin mining activities to focus solely on its AI data center targets, sending a positive signal to potential hyperscaler tenants,” the analysts wrote. Rittenhouse's report compares Galaxy's approach to that of other crypto miners like Riot Platforms and Cipher Mining, which have attempted to reframe themselves as diversified data infrastructure providers. But the report argues that, in reality, these companies had no concrete AI goals until the AI boom began. *This is not investment advice.

Despite the disclosure, the token’s valuation is down 6% for the day, coinciding with the broader decline of the digital asset market. The Deal’s Specifics The popular cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com shook hands with the investment management firm Canary Capital to establish the Canary CRO Trust. The financial vehicle is designed explicitly for eligible individual and institutional accredited investors in the United States and will provide them with exposure to CRO – the native token of the Cronos network. Steven McClurg, CEO of Canary Capital, praised Crypto.com for its efforts to “set the bar for what it means to bring institutional-grade access to crypto markets.” He thinks the initiative will increase the demand for CRO and “will reflect the broader success” of the platform. Eric Anziani, President and COO of Crypto.com, said that providing traders with additional options to engage with the digital asset sector is “central” to the company’s vision. “We are incredibly excited to partner with Canary Capital to enable more investors in the U.S. to contribute to the Cronos journey ahead,” he added. CRO Heads South Despite the announcement, the price of CRO remains in red territory on a daily scale. Currently, it trades at around $0.09 (per CoinGecko’s data), representing a 6% decrease on a 24-hour scale. CRO Price, Source: CoinGecko One likely reason contributing to the downtrend is the overall decline of the entire cryptocurrency market observed in the past several hours. Recall that bitcoin (BTC) surged past $107,000 but was violently rejected and was pushed south to under $102,500. Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and many other leading altcoins also dropped, registering even bigger daily declines than the largest cryptocurrency. It is worth noting that CRO’s price reacted much more positively and spiked by double digits following Crypto.com’s previous partnership, inked in March. Back then, the company teamed up with Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) – the media company whose majority owner is US President Donald Trump. Their goal is to launch certain exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and exchange-traded products (ETPs) with BTC and CRO as underlying cryptocurrencies. “We aim to create inventive funds incorporating firms that concentrate on rapid growth, technological innovation, and strengthening the U.S. economy, unencumbered by woke nonsense and political posturing,” TMTG’s CEO Devin Nunes stated at the time.

2025-05-19T14:24:35.000Z,"Chinese printer maker spread Bitcoin stealing malware — Report","Chinese printer manufacturer Procolored distributed Bitcoin-stealing malware alongside its official drivers, according to local media reports. Chinese news outlet Landian News reported on May 19 that Shenzhen-based printer company Procolored has been distributing Bitcoin-stealing ( BTC ) malware alongside official drivers. The company reportedly used USB drivers to distribute malware-ridden drivers and uploaded the compromised software to cloud storage for global download. A total of 9.3 BTC worth over $953,000 have been stolen, according to the report. Crypto tracking and compliance firm Slow Mist described how the malware operates in a May 19 X post : “The official driver provided by this printer carries a backdoor program. It will hijack the wallet address in the user’s clipboard and replace it with the attacker's address.“ Source: MistTrack Related: Massive supply chain attack targeting small number of crypto companies: Kaspersky YouTuber flags malware in Procolored drivers Landian News recommended users who downloaded Procolored printer drivers in the past six months to “immediately perform a full system scan using antivirus software.” Still, given the hit or miss nature of antivirus software, a full system reset is always the better option when in doubt: “Ideally, you should reinstall your operating system and thoroughly check old files.“ The issue was allegedly first reported by YouTuber Cameron Coward , whose antivirus software detected malware in the drivers while testing a Procolored UV printer. The software flagged the drive as containing a worm and a trojan virus named Foxif. Related: Coinbase faces $400M bill after insider phishing attack Cybersecurity company confirms crypto-stealing malware When contacted, Procolored denied the claims and dismissed the antivirus tool flagging the drivers as a false positive. Coward turned to Reddit , where he shared the issue with cybersecurity professionals, attracting the attention of cybersecurity firm G-Data. G-Data’s investigation found that most of Procolored’s drivers were hosted on the file hosting service MEGA, with uploads as old as October 2023. Analysis of those files confirmed that they were compromised by two distinct pieces of malware: backdoor Win32.Backdoor.XRedRAT.A and a crypto stealer designed to substitute addresses in the clipboard with those controlled by the attacker. G-Data contacted Procolored, with the hardware producer saying it deleted the infected drivers from its storage on May 8 and re-scanned all files. Procolored attributed the malware to a supply chain compromise, stating that the malicious files were introduced through infected USB devices before being uploaded online.

2025-05-19T14:15:27.000Z,"Privacy Coins: Đang Trỗi Dậy Mạnh Mẽ?","Privacy Coins là loại tiền mã hóa được thiết kế để tăng cường quyền riêng tư và bảo mật cho người dùng. Privacy Coins như Monero (XMR) và Zcash (ZEC) gần đây đã vượt mặt nhiều gã khổng lồ nổi tiếng trong thị trường crypto, phản ánh sự hồi sinh mạnh mẽ của mối quan tâm đến quyền riêng tư tài chính giữa lúc lo ngại về giám sát và kiểm soát quy định gia tăng. Đặc biệt, Monero đã thể hiện sức mạnh đáng kinh ngạc, tăng giá mạnh so với cả USD và Bitcoin trong năm qua, bất chấp việc bị gỡ bỏ khỏi các sàn giao dịch lớn . Những thách thức này đã thúc đẩy sự phát triển của một hệ sinh thái ngang hàng bền vững, củng cố tính phi tập trung của Monero và phù hợp với gốc rễ cypherpunk của nó. Khi các mạng lưới crypto truyền thống dần hướng tới tuân thủ và áp dụng từ các tổ chức, privacy coins đang được xem như một đối trọng tiềm năng, mang lại cho người dùng khả năng giao dịch tự do mà không bị phơi bày hay kiểm duyệt. Privacy Coins: Bí Mật Tốt Nhất Trong Thế Giới Crypto? Tính đến ngày 13/05/2025, Monero (XMR) và Zcash (ZEC) đều đã thể hiện xu hướng tăng giá mạnh mẽ, vượt qua nhiều loại tiền mã hóa hàng đầu khác, cho thấy sự hồi sinh trong nhu cầu về các đồng tiền tập trung vào quyền riêng tư. Điều này nhấn mạnh giá trị độc đáo của chúng trong thị trường hiện tại. Sự bứt phá của Monero và Zcash có thể được lý giải bởi mối lo ngại ngày càng tăng về quyền riêng tư kỹ thuật số và mong muốn thực hiện các giao dịch bảo mật. Khi các cuộc thảo luận pháp lý toàn cầu ngày càng gay gắt, nhà đầu tư dường như đang tìm đến những tài sản mang lại tính ẩn danh cao hơn. Xu hướng này cho thấy quyền riêng tư đang trở thành yếu tố quan trọng trong quyết định đầu tư. Nếu nhu cầu về các giải pháp bảo vệ quyền riêng tư tiếp tục tăng, Monero và Zcash có thể duy trì sức hút. Hiệu suất vượt trội của chúng so với các đồng tiền lớn khác cho thấy tiềm năng khai thác thị trường ngách này. Tuy nhiên, nhà đầu tư cần theo dõi sát các diễn biến pháp lý, vì những thay đổi có thể ảnh hưởng đến tính khả thi và mức độ chấp nhận của privacy coins. Tại Sao Privacy Coins Lại Đột Nhiên Hồi Sinh? Sự hồi sinh gần đây của các đồng privacy coins như Monero (XMR) và Zcash (ZEC) phản ánh mối lo ngại toàn cầu ngày càng lớn về giám sát tài chính, chủ quyền dữ liệu và sự suy giảm quyền riêng tư trong đời sống số. Khi ngân hàng trung ương và cơ quan quản lý tiến tới các khuôn khổ như CBDCs (tiền kỹ thuật số của ngân hàng trung ương), giám sát giao dịch thời gian thực và chính sách KYC/AML nghiêm ngặt hơn, người dùng đang tìm kiếm công cụ giúp bảo vệ sự ẩn danh tài chính. Privacy coins đóng vai trò như một lá chắn công nghệ, cho phép chuyển giá trị ngang hàng mà không để lộ lịch sử giao dịch hay số dư ví. Monero đặc biệt thu hút sự chú ý nhờ kiến trúc bảo mật mạnh mẽ, bao gồm chữ ký vòng , địa chỉ ẩn và giao dịch bảo mật . Điều này đảm bảo rằng người gửi, người nhận và số tiền giao dịch đều được che giấu hoàn toàn – những tính năng không chỉ hấp dẫn với những người ủng hộ quyền riêng tư mà còn với các tổ chức coi trọng tính bảo mật trong hoạt động tài chính. Zcash, với tính năng bảo mật tùy chọn thông qua ZK-SNARKs , cũng nhận được sự quan tâm mới sau các bản cập nhật cải thiện tốc độ và trải nghiệm người dùng. Những tiến bộ này đã làm cho privacy coins dễ tiếp cận và hiệu quả hơn, mở rộng phạm vi ứng dụng của chúng ra ngoài lý tưởng ban đầu. Bối cảnh kinh tế vĩ mô cũng góp phần thúc đẩy. Khi lạm phát kéo dài ở nhiều khu vực và các biện pháp kiểm soát vốn gia tăng ở thị trường mới nổi, privacy coins trở thành công cụ bí mật để bảo vệ tài sản hoặc chuyển tiền quốc tế. Việc siết chặt các ví tự lưu trữ (self-custody) và ví phi lưu ký (non-custodial) ở nhiều khu vực chỉ làm tăng nhận thức về tầm quan trọng của khả năng chống kiểm duyệt trong tài chính số. Cuộc tranh luận về lọc giao dịch trong mempool của Bitcoin, đặc biệt là xung quanh CoinJoin, càng làm nổi bật vai trò của quyền riêng tư trong “tiền lành mạnh,” đẩy một số người dùng tìm đến các giải pháp chuyên dụng như Monero và Zcash. Sự Chuyển Dịch Của OG Bitcoiners Sang Privacy Coins Trong vài năm qua, ngày càng nhiều “OG Bitcoiners” – những người tiên phong trong cộng đồng Bitcoin – đã chuyển sự chú ý sang các privacy coins như Monero và Zcash. Khi các khung pháp lý về tài sản kỹ thuật số minh bạch dần được củng cố và các tổ chức bắt đầu tích hợp Bitcoin, nhiều người ủng hộ ban đầu đã tìm cách đa dạng hóa vào các tài sản chưa thu hút sự quan tâm của các tổ chức. Trong khi các công ty đang xây dựng kho dự trữ Bitcoin và giám sát quy định ngày càng gia tăng, một số OGs cho rằng Bitcoin đã bị thâu tóm bởi chính hệ thống ngân hàng mà nó từng thách thức. Ngược lại, privacy coins vẫn đại diện cho cam kết cypherpunk về phi tập trung, chống kiểm duyệt và tự chủ tài chính. Thuở ban đầu, quyền riêng tư là nền tảng của câu chuyện Bitcoin. Nhưng khi sự chấp nhận phổ biến tăng lên, nhiều dự án đã chuyển hướng sang tuân thủ pháp luật, thường hy sinh quyền riêng tư của người dùng. Privacy coins giờ đây chiếm lĩnh một thị trường ngách ngày càng phù hợp trong bối cảnh pháp lý hiện đại: không gian dành cho những ai muốn giao dịch tự do mà không bị giám sát, phơi bày hay kiểm soát. Khi hệ thống tài chính số tiếp tục phát triển, nhu cầu về tiền thật sự riêng tư không chỉ tồn tại mà còn tăng trưởng theo cấp số nhân. Monero: Sự Bền Bỉ Ấn Tượng Từ năm 2015, Monero (XMR) đã thể hiện hiệu suất ấn tượng, vượt xa Bitcoin (BTC) trong năm qua. Tính đến ngày 13/05/2025, XMR đã tăng 154% so với một năm trước, trong khi Bitcoin chỉ tăng 70%. So với Bitcoin, Monero tăng khoảng 35%. Monero từ lâu đã phải đối mặt với sự kháng cự từ các sàn giao dịch tập trung, nhiều trong số đó từ chối niêm yết do các tính năng bảo mật mạnh mẽ và sự giám sát quy định đi kèm. Trong vài năm qua, điều này đã dẫn đến làn sóng gỡ bỏ, đặc biệt ở các khu vực siết chặt yêu cầu chống rửa tiền (AML). Dù vậy, dự án vẫn tiếp tục phát triển mạnh mẽ. Cộng đồng vững chắc, tốc độ phát triển ổn định và sự gia tăng sử dụng trong các thị trường ngang hàng đã thúc đẩy sự hồi sinh âm thầm, gợi nhớ đến những ngày đầu của Bitcoin – khi nó cũng bị chỉ trích, hiểu nhầm và đẩy ra rìa trước khi đạt được sự công nhận rộng rãi. Việc hủy niêm yết Monero khỏi các sàn lớn vô tình củng cố dự án bằng cách buộc cộng đồng tập trung hơn vào phi tập trung và xây dựng hệ sinh thái P2P bền vững. Khi các cổng fiat truyền thống đóng cửa, người dùng bắt đầu phát triển và áp dụng các phương pháp thay thế để mua, bán và sử dụng Monero , từ sàn phi tập trung (DEXs) đến thị trường P2P được mã hóa và các giao thức truyền thông như SimpleX , Signal và Session . Sự chuyển đổi này đã tạo ra một nền kinh tế tuần hoàn, nơi Monero được sử dụng trực tiếp cho hàng hóa, dịch vụ và giao dịch xuyên biên giới mà không phụ thuộc vào bên thứ ba. Nhờ đó, cộng đồng Monero đã nâng cao khả năng chống kiểm duyệt và độc lập vận hành, hiện thực hóa nhiều mục tiêu cypherpunk ban đầu về quyền riêng tư và tự chủ tài chính. Hiệu suất ấn tượng của Monero có thể được quy cho nhiều yếu tố, bao gồm trọng tâm mạnh mẽ vào quyền riêng tư – một điểm sáng trong bối cảnh lo ngại về giám sát kỹ thuật số ngày càng tăng. Sự tăng trưởng ổn định và khả năng chống chịu trước biến động thị trường nhấn mạnh vị trí của Monero như một nhân tố quan trọng trong thế giới tiền mã hóa. Tập trung vào quyền riêng tư và an ninh tiếp tục thu hút người dùng và nhà đầu tư tìm kiếm lựa chọn thay thế cho các mạng blockchain minh bạch hơn. Tóm Lại Là: Privacy coins như Monero và Zcash đang chứng minh rằng nhu cầu về quyền riêng tư tài chính không bao giờ lỗi thời. Giữa bối cảnh giám sát gia tăng và áp lực pháp lý, chúng đại diện cho một làn gió ngược chiều đầy ý nghĩa, bảo vệ quyền tự do giao dịch mà không bị kiểm soát. Với hệ sinh thái P2P ngày càng mạnh mẽ và công nghệ bảo mật tiên tiến, Monero và Zcash không chỉ là lựa chọn thay thế mà còn là biểu tượng cho tương lai của tiền mã hóa tự do và phi tập trung. Tuy nhiên, nhà đầu tư cần thận trọng trước các rủi ro pháp lý tiềm ẩn, vì hành trình của privacy coins vẫn còn đầy thách thức phía trước.

2025-05-19T14:14:36.000Z,"Best Crypto to Buy Now As MetaPlanet Adds Another 1,004 Bitcoin To Its Portfolio","Over the past few years, the idea of corporations directly investing in Bitcoin has shifted from experimental to strategic. Major players like Tesla and MicroStrategy set the tone, converting parts of their treasury into BTC as a hedge against inflation and a vote of confidence in digital assets. More recently, the institutional tide has turned into a wave. Sovereign wealth funds, asset managers, and public companies from Asia to the U.S. have taken notable positions. MicroStrategy’s consistent accumulation has often made headlines, but now another name—MetaPlanet—is increasingly being discussed in the same breath. MetaPlanet Targets 10,000 BTC With Latest $104.3 Million Purchase MetaPlanet, a Tokyo-listed investment and holding firm, has expanded its Bitcoin position with the acquisition of an additional 1,004 BTC. The purchase, valued at approximately $104.3 million, was disclosed on Monday and reflects the company’s ongoing treasury strategy. With this buy, MetaPlanet’s total Bitcoin holdings have grown to 7,800 BTC. At current market prices, this stack is worth more than $806 million. The average acquisition cost across all purchases is estimated at $91,300 per BTC, while the latest tranche came in at a higher $103,873 per coin. *Metaplanet Acquires Additional 1,004 $BTC * pic.twitter.com/r86rLc7ngh — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) May 19, 2025 The company began accumulating Bitcoin in April 2024 and has moved quickly since then, citing long-term conviction in BTC as both a treasury asset and a strategic store of value. The goal is clear: MetaPlanet intends to hold 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025. It has already implemented a roadmap to reach this target, primarily financing the acquisitions through bond issuances. Most recently, the company completed its 15th ordinary bond issuance, securing an additional $15 million to support further purchases. This strategy mirrors that of MicroStrategy, a firm known for pioneering Bitcoin-heavy balance sheets. MetaPlanet appears to be following a similar model but with added urgency, likely influenced by the current macroeconomic climate and renewed optimism in crypto markets. At the time of the latest purchase, Bitcoin was trading just below its all-time high, hovering around $103,343. As institutional interest grows and market confidence returns, MetaPlanet’s aggressive positioning places it firmly among the most Bitcoin-committed public companies globally. Best Crypto to Buy Now As Institutions Go All In on Crypto Best Wallet As investment firms like MetaPlanet aggressively scale their Bitcoin reserves, one of the clearer messages to the market is that self-custody and direct asset control are becoming essential. Best Wallet Token presale aligns with that shift by offering a non-custodial, multi-chain wallet that supports over 60 networks. While MetaPlanet focuses on macro-level accumulation, individual users and traders need secure infrastructure to store and manage their assets—which is exactly what Best Wallet is built for. What separates this wallet from others is how it consolidates multiple tools into a single platform. Through the DEX, staking interfaces, and presale aggregator, users can not only hold tokens but act on opportunities immediately. This is where the BEST token comes in. Holders unlock platform benefits such as higher APYs, exclusive presale access, and lower fees, making it an active utility within the ecosystem rather than a passive asset. As adoption grows among institutions and retail interest tracks behind it, Best Wallet offers retail users the ability to interact with the space with far fewer steps. With MetaPlanet and others signaling long-term confidence in crypto, wallets like this don’t just support basic storage—they enable more responsive, informed participation. The lack of a desktop version and limited NFT integration might hold back some users, but for anyone focused on token trading, discovery, and self-custody, Best Wallet fits the current momentum. It offers structure in a time when infrastructure is becoming more relevant with every billion-dollar Bitcoin buy. SUBBD SUBBD is built to challenge how value flows in the creator economy. Instead of relying on ad-based models or centralized subscription platforms, it offers a direct system where both creators and supporters benefit. The $SUBBD token acts as the primary tool within this structure. It allows users to back creators, access exclusive content, and participate in the project’s long-term direction through token staking and engagement-based rewards. This isn't just a content-sharing system—it’s an infrastructure that gives users financial leverage in the attention-driven internet. Every creator on SUBBD becomes a self-contained economy, where their followers help shape growth and also benefit from it. The platform provides an on-chain system where ownership of digital influence is traceable and transferrable. SUBBD also incorporates decentralized decision-making, giving token holders input on platform improvements and monetization tools. This was highlighted by ClayBro , a popular crypto YouTuber who also seemed to be bullish about the project. This removes the dependency on centralized decision-makers who typically prioritize advertisers over users or content creators. As digital monetization becomes more performance-based, SUBBD positions its system to reward not just visibility but participation and support. With increasing dissatisfaction around the way traditional platforms handle creator earnings and community input, SUBBD provides a credible alternative. The $SUBBD token ties the entire model together, acting as access, utility, and incentive—all backed by a working product aimed at changing how influence and income connect in the digital world. Solaxy Solaxy is a blockchain protocol designed to reduce complexity in cross-chain transactions. Rather than offering yet another experimental Layer 2 solution, it focuses on practical performance by linking two high-traffic networks: Solana and Ethereum. This design supports developers and users who want access to the speed of Solana while still interacting with Ethereum’s liquidity and tools. The native token, SOLX, powers the core functions of the protocol. It covers transaction fees, secures the network through staking, and allows participants to earn yields in return for supporting ecosystem stability. The chain is optimized for high transaction volumes and is built to handle diverse applications, from finance to gaming to real-time asset exchanges. What makes Solaxy relevant now is its timing. As demand grows for better throughput without sacrificing compatibility, many applications are looking for solutions that can handle scale without fragmenting their user base. Solaxy provides that bridge. Rather than building isolated tools, it focuses on shared functionality across both ecosystems. Its infrastructure is already live, with a working validator system and user dashboards. For token holders, SOLX isn't a passive asset. It opens access to staking pools, fee rebates, and protocol governance, giving holders practical use cases from day one. With blockchain adoption expanding and performance becoming a higher priority, Solaxy positions itself as a network that solves specific integration needs without relying on speculative narratives. MIND of Pepe MetaPlanet’s recent $104 million addition to its Bitcoin portfolio wasn’t just a headline—it was a reflection of where institutional priorities are heading. In a market where perception and momentum shape price as much as fundamentals, projects like MIND of Pepe offer a different kind of edge. This isn’t about following the money—it’s about understanding the signals that often come before the money moves. MIND of Pepe operates through an on-chain AI agent that actively monitors and interacts with social media platforms. The goal is to extract and share early signals related to investor behavior, sentiment shifts, and viral momentum—insights that institutional players often pay millions to access through private research. Token holders gain access to these reports and can influence the AI’s development path by voting on proposals. The $MIND token enables access to sentiment data, behavioral tracking, and trend analysis. These are not recycled metrics but real-time analytics drawn from crypto Twitter, meme communities, and influencer content. As more institutions move in, the space between raw data and actionable insight grows smaller—and MIND of Pepe positions itself right in that gap. While MetaPlanet is setting a precedent for Bitcoin accumulation at scale, MIND of Pepe is enabling users to anticipate where the attention is building next. In a market driven by narratives and engagement, this tool gives individual holders a way to respond with the speed and clarity that larger firms usually reserve for themselves. BTC Bull BTC Bull is structured to act as a tribute to Bitcoin’s long-term mission, but with mechanisms built for faster community growth. It borrows Bitcoin’s core themes—limited supply, decentralization, and resistance to manipulation—but presents them in a format designed to attract today’s token investors. The project doesn't claim to reinvent blockchain. Instead, it supports Bitcoin through a token that rewards alignment and participation. The BTC Bull token offers staking for users who want to commit their tokens over time. This isn't an empty reward system; it’s designed to reward those who align with Bitcoin’s larger purpose, by rewarding users in the form of airdrops and burns every time BTC makes a price milestone. The longer a user holds or stakes, the better the returns, encouraging holders to stay through cycles rather than chase quick exits. Guess who's back mfs 🐂🔥 #BTC pic.twitter.com/3tVjIXAmMj — BTCBULL_TOKEN (@BTCBULL_TOKEN) May 8, 2025 The project is also anchored in visual and social familiarity, using clean branding to draw in Bitcoin supporters and meme coin enthusiasts alike. What sets BTC Bull apart from low-effort meme tokens is its structure. The supply is fixed, and there is no hidden team tax or unclear redistribution logic. Every part of the token economy is explained and public. BTC Bull is not a layer for applications or tools, nor does it promise complex features. Its utility is focused and simple: represent belief in Bitcoin while rewarding holders for staying involved. It’s a straightforward model that cuts through the noise, aimed at people who support Bitcoin but want a token that reflects that interest with clearer upside and faster engagement. Conclusion While large firms continue scaling their exposure, the projects highlighted above are quietly building the kind of groundwork that tends to matter later. They haven’t peaked, they’re not saturated, and they haven’t priced in broader adoption yet. That’s exactly why they deserve a closer look right now—before the rest of the market catches up.

2025-05-19T14:10:42.000Z,"Institution wallet dumps Lido DAO and Blur, triggering up to 25% price decline","While Bitcoin’s latest rebound past $105K renewed the altcoin season narrative, blockchain data suggests a delay, with key investors reducing their exposure. An institution or whale investor has dumped massive amounts of Lido DAO Token and Blur Coin in what seems to be an organized move. On-chain analytics platform Lookonchain highlighted that the wallet transferred 21.3 million LDO, worth around $21.6 million, and 34.2 million BLUR, worth approximately $4 million, into top centralized exchanges, including Binance, Bybit, Gate.io, and OKX, within the previous week. Lookonchain @lookonchain · Follow A whale/institution is dumping $LDO and $BLUR !Over the past week, they deposited 21.3M $LDO ($21.6M) and 34.2M $BLUR ($4M) into exchanges.They still hold 9.22M $LDO ($8.15M) and 43.69M $BLUR ($4.5M) left. $LDO dropped 25% and $BLUR dropped 20% in the past week. 11:30 AM · May 19, 2025 159 Reply Copy link Read 19 replies The transactions have grabbed the cryptocurrency community’s attention, especially due to the massive price dips. LDO lost 25% within a week, while BLUR declined by 20%. Whale moves dent market sentiment Whale transactions are crucial as they set the market’s tone, especially for smaller-cap tokens like BLUR and Lido DAO. These entities accumulate assets with upside potential and dump those with weak momentum. Moreover, retail investors adopt panic selling when top holders begin to offload their holdings. That will potentially lead to intensified downward pressure on cryptocurrency’s price. The latest dump has already triggered negative sentiments around LDO and BLUR. The altcoins display bearish dominance, hinting at continued declines in the near term. LDO’s daily trading volume has increased by 65%, while BLUR sees a 78% uptick in the same metric. Soaring trader activity amid negative sentiments often signals magnified selling activities. LDO hovers at $0.8700, whereas BLUR trades at $0.1019 per token, reflecting significant losses on their daily price charts. Source – Coinmarketcap Moreover, the wallet still holds considerable amounts of Lido DAO and Blur tokens. It has 9.22 million LDO and 43.69 million BLUR, worth around $8.15M and $4.5M, respectively, at market values. Will the wallet continue dumping as prices display weakness? Such a trend could mean further LDO and BLUR declines in the upcoming times. Insider knowledge While unmasking transactions in the crypto world is a challenge, enthusiasts are buzzing with theories. The massive transaction and remaining balance showed this isn’t an ordinary investor. EmberCN links LDO’s transaction to a team member or early participants who received the assets before listing. For BLUR, the transfers could be from an airdrop recipient or token unlocks. Furthermore, the investors could be leveraging the latest rallies to take profits at favorable prices, especially as the prevailing broad consolidations hint at short-term corrections before upside resumptions.

The S&P 500 fell 0.8% at the open, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1%, as the downgrade combined with broader market concerns to dampen investor sentiment. The blue-chip index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average each lost more than 200 points in early trading although within the first 45 minutes of trading buyers came in and pushed major indices to nearly flat. As stocks and the dollar reacted lower, Treasury yields spiked. The 30 year Treasury yields climbed to the 5% level, reflecting market concerns over U.S. debt amid Moody’s Ratings downgrade. Any further surges in the 30-year yield will see it hit an 18-year high. Update The 30-year yield is now 5.03%—highest since October 2023.

Despite recent deals with China and the United Kingdom, President Donald Trump’s overall tariff policy has also had an impact and investors eye more clarity and more deals. Commenting on Moody’s downgrade, RBC Capital Markets head of U.S. equity strategy Lori Calvasina told CNBC in an interview : “There’s not a ton of importance here… It’s more symbolic, but at the same time, if it’s going to push 10 year treasury yields up, my market is going to care.” Monday’s downbeat open comes after a largely positive week for U.S. stocks. The Nasdaq Composite closed more than 7% up last week, while the S&P 500 edged more than 5% for a five-day winning streak that had investors upbeat. Even the Dow, which struggled a bit over the week, rose to end the week more than 3% up. With the 10-year yield also surging to above 4.5%, stocks heaved under sell-off pressure. Cryptocurrencies also dipped, with Bitcoin ( BTC ) plunging to lows of $102k after retesting highs of $107k on Sunday.

The new solution, dubbed Payroll Treasury Yield, uses blockchain lending protocols to help firms earn returns on payroll funds that would otherwise sit idle, the company told Cointelegraph in an exclusive statement. Franklin said its new offering integrates Summer.fi, a decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform, to allow companies to deposit stablecoin-denominated payroll reserves into smart contract-based lending pools. These funds are lent to vetted borrowers, and companies earn yields while retaining access to their capital. Companies maintain full custody throughout the process, and smart contracts used are audited to reduce risk. “The problem that Franklin solves for is two-fold,” Megan Knab, founder and CEO of Franklin, told Cointelegraph. For companies that have already integrated crypto onto their balance sheets, Franklin helps them use those assets to manage their operations, she said. “But for the broader market, we are enabling business models of the future, where money moves instantly, more intelligently, and to more globally,” Knab added. Source: Franklin Related: PayPal to offer 3.7% yield on stablecoin balances: Report Alternative to T-Bills Franklin said its new offering is an alternative to traditional treasury tools like sweep accounts or T-bills, which often involve operational complexity and limited returns. Furthermore, it differentiates from earned wage access (EWA) platforms, which enable employees to access their earned wages before their scheduled payday by avoiding additional debt and associated costs. “Traditional payments in the next decade will run entirely on public blockchain rails as a wholesale replacement to ACH and SWIFT,” Knab said. She added that if onchain payroll products go mainstream, banks could fade into the background. While technology may replace many banking functions with self-custody tools and smart contracts, regulatory frameworks will still require accountable legal entities. The result may be “zombie-like institutions” — banks in name only, existing to meet compliance rules but playing a minimal role in actual payment processing, Knab said. However, decentralized lending comes with risks like smart contract vulnerabilities and market fluctuations. Franklin said it aims to mitigate these by using Summer.fi’s audited contracts and overcollateralized lending.

Some MSTR shareholders are displeased with the firm’s accounting practices and feel they have suffered losses as a result of improper risk statements: Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) the anticipated profitability of the Company’s bitcoin-focused investment strategy and treasury operations was overstated; (ii) the various risks associated with bitcoin’s volatility and the magnitude of losses Strategy could recognize on the value of its digital assets following its adoption of ASU 2023-08 were understated; and (iii) as a result, Defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. The lawsuit also heavily relies on the newly adopted ‘Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-08, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other—Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60): Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets (“ASU 2023-08”).’ In summary, suing investors allege that Michael Saylor’s company offered severely misleading data on the performance of its Bitcoin ( BTC ) strategy. According to Pomerantz’s press release, the inciting incident was the April 7, 2025, $5.91 billion loss disclosure that triggered a rapid 8.67% MSTR stock price drop. While it is not known at press time how much money the plaintiffs are demanding, Strategy expressed its intent to fight vigorously. Why MSTR investors are yet to price in the lawsuit Elsewhere, it is doubtful if MSTR investors have priced in the class action lawsuit. To begin with, following an initial 2% drop in the Monday pre-market, the equity entered a rapid rally immediately after the morning bell. What makes the upswing even stranger is that there has been no shortage of adverse economic news in the second half of May. A major cause for investor anxiety came from Moody’s, which downgraded the U.S. credit rating, thus turbocharging the already-rising 30-year treasury yield.

The relatively larger acquisition happened during a bullish week, with an average price above $103,000. Strategy (MSTR) continued its weekly BTC purchases, this time adding 7,390 BTC to its reserves. The company acquired the additional coins as BTC had a turbulent week with a hike to $106,000. Strategy has acquired 7,390 BTC for ~$764.9 million at ~$103,498 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 16.3% YTD 2025. As of 5/18/2025, we hodl 576,230 $BTC acquired for ~$40.18 billion at ~$69,726 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRK $STRF https://t.co/woIBO11Hz9 — Strategy (@Strategy) May 19, 2025 The latest purchase was in the middle of the range for the weekly buying operations, down from the previous week’s acquisition of 13,390 BTC . After the latest purchase, MSTR common stock traded at $399.80, down from its recent six-month peak. Strategy shares are down from their recent six-month high, though remaining one of the winners for the past month. | Source: Google Finance The latest announcement also included a recent development for Strategy, reporting on an alleged lawsuit filed with the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The class-action lawsuit against Michael Saylor and associates claims misleading statements on the potential returns for BTC-based investments. The lawsuit covers the April 30, 2024 to April 4, 2025 period, and alleges misleading statements and failure to disclose information on the anticipated profitability of the BTC investment and treasury operations. Despite the purchase announcement, BTC still erased some of its gains over the weekend. The leading coin traded at $102,447, below the average price of Strategy’s purchase for the past week. Despite this, the firm is still in the green with a $69,726 average price per BTC. Strategy achieved its latest purchase after the sale of over $705M in common stock. This week’s purchase is relatively high compared to previous periods, showing BTC bullish momentum translated into demand for MSTR . The rest of the purchase was financed with $59.7M in STRK convertible instruments. After the latest addition to the treasury, Strategy has $18.98B in common stock authorized to issue, and another $20.85B to issue in the form of STRK. With the latest purchase, Strategy has already allocated over $40B to BTC acquisitions at market price, with nearly as much remaining in authorized but not issued common stock or convertible STRK shares. Strategy inspires other companies to keep buying The latest Strategy acquisition coincides with a new announcement from Metaplanet. The Japanese company added another 1,004 BTC to its balance, at an average price of $103,873 per BTC, a higher entry point compared to Strategy. Just like MSTR, Metaplanet stock rallied to $4.39 , close to its higher range for the next few months. Metaplanet also entered the top 10 of the most liquid stocks on the Japanese market, generating new demand by following Strategy’s model. With the latest purchase, Metaplanet holds 7,800 BTC, getting close to its goal for 2025 to acquire 10,000 BTC. In the past week, announcements from corporations aiming to acquire BTC accelerated. Not all potential buyers made good on their promises. A total of 108 public companies hold BTC in their balance, with seven new treasuries added in the past two weeks. Large-scale treasuries now contain 3.33M BTC, one of the biggest reserves with potential long-term holding. Strategy and Metaplanet bought even though ETFs had net outflows in Q1 and a slowly growing balance in Q2. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

2025-05-19T13:37:53.000Z,"Bitcoin’s Realized Capitalization Hits Record $906B – Is a Bull Run Brewing?","Bitcoin has set a new milestone in on-chain metrics. Its Realized Capitalization has reached a fresh high of $906.04 billion for the fourth consecutive week. This metric reflects the total value of all unspent Bitcoin transaction outputs (UTXOs) based on their purchase price, and has now surpassed its previous record as BTC continues consolidating around the crucial support of $103,000. Experts say that this trend could set the stage for a historic bull run. Bullish Breakout Ahead? Since the current range-bound phase began on May 8, Bitcoin has absorbed an additional $14.4 billion in new capital, which is a 1.61% increase in Realized Capitalization. According to CryptoQuant’s latest report , this is an indicator of steady investor inflow. It further suggests that once Bitcoin decisively clears the $104,731 resistance level, the next target at $107,757 could come into play, which, in turn, could potentially open the door to a new all-time high. Interestingly, driving much of this capital accumulation are large holders, with the 100-1,000 BTC UTXO value bands increasing their combined holdings by 122,540 BTC over the past 10 days. This figure represented a 2.2% increase. Institutional interest remains uneven, but BlackRock has emerged as the only major ETF to add to its Bitcoin holdings during this period, which has increased its balance by 10,302 BTC (1.66%) to 631,902 BTC, while other funds have either trimmed exposure or held steady. As such, CryptoQuant observed that the upward trend in Realized Capitalization signals market confidence. If the trend continues, it could support further price expansion and potentially catalyze a historic bull run. Bitcoin’s June Explosion Looms Matrixport’s recent market update also echoed a similar trend, as Bitcoin’s surge has found significant backing from multiple positive catalysts. The platform stated that the fading of crucial downside risks, such as US tech sector pressure due to Q1 earnings and concerns over AI-related capex, has reopened the door for asset growth. Strong earnings and renewed commitments from major tech firms have helped restore investor confidence and lifted equities and crypto alike. Political shifts have also played a role, as US President Donald Trump promoted inbound investments and potential policy tailwinds like extended tax cuts and deregulation. Matrixport said that it turned bullish in mid-April, supported by its trend model signaling a reversal into an uptrend. The firm expects a favorable window for risk assets until July, as this period coincides with the Q2 earnings season, the conclusion of the 90-day tariff truce, and peak liquidity conditions. Another key catalyst is the upcoming $5 billion in FTX creditor payouts set for late May, which could flow into crypto markets and boost momentum in June. Combined with steady ETF inflows and stablecoin growth, these factors may sustain Bitcoin’s rally.

2025-05-19T13:37:38.000Z,"HBAR price dips, but numerous catalysts point to Hedera rebound","Hedera Hashgraph price continued its downward trend on Monday, May 19, as demand for Bitcoin and other altcoins eased. Hedera Hashgraph ( HBAR ) dropped to $0.1870, down by almost 20% from its highest level this month and 54% from its highest in November last year. The ongoing HBAR price retreat happened as the crypto market lost momentum. Bitcoin ( BTC ) retreated to $102,000, a day after it hit $107,000 for the first time since January. Third-party data shows that Hedera’s network fundamentals remain strong, with the total value locked in its decentralized finance ecosystem rising by 15% over the last 30 days to $186 million. The top-performing platforms are Stader and Bonzo Finance. You might also like: MOODENG on Ethereum eyes 85% rally as golden cross forms Additional data shows that the supply of stablecoins on Hedera has surged significantly. As shown in the chart below, the supply jumped to $181.2 million on Monday, up from a year-to-date low of $40 million. It stood at $131 million just last Friday. Hedera stablecoin market cap | Source: DeFi Llama A soaring stablecoin supply on a blockchain is generally seen as a positive indicator, suggesting rising on-chain activity. It can also drive higher network revenues as transaction volumes increase. For example, Tron ( TRX ) has become the most profitable chain due to its dominant share of Tether transactions. Decentralized exchange volume on Hedera also climbed, with a more than 80% increase in the past week to $70.4 million. This brought the network’s cumulative DEX volume to $4.58 billion. Another bullish signal is that the funding rate in the futures market has remained positive since April 16. A positive funding rate indicates that traders expect future prices to rise, a generally bullish sentiment. Hedera funding rate | Source: CoinGlass HBAR price technical analysis Hedera price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that HBAR has pulled back in recent sessions. On the positive side, the token remains above the 200-day Exponential Moving Average and the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level. Hedera has also formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern, a popular bullish reversal sign in technical analysis. Therefore, the Hedera price may bounce back in the next few days as the US credit rating downgrade jitters end . If this happens, the initial target to watch will be at $0.2240, the 50% Fibonacci Retracement level. A move below the support at $0.15 will invalidate the bullish outlook.

2025-05-19T13:17:49.000Z,"Tether Surpasses Germany in US Treasury Holdings","The stablecoin giant also reported more than $1 billion in operating profit in the first quarter. This was driven by traditional asset holdings like Treasury bills and gold, which cushioned the impact of crypto market volatility. As the US debates stablecoin regulation through bills like the STABLE Act and the GENIUS Act, Tether’s growing influence proves the increasing institutional acceptance of stablecoins. Meanwhile, Tether also recently backed a massive Bitcoin acquisition on behalf of Twenty One Capital by purchasing $458.7 million worth of BTC as the firm prepares for a public listing via a SPAC merger. With backing from SoftBank and Bitfinex, Twenty One now ranks as the third-largest corporate Bitcoin holder and plans to become the top institutional vehicle for Bitcoin exposure. Overall, it is quite clear that Tether is expanding its footprint across traditional and crypto markets. Tether Ranks Among World’s Largest Treasury Holders Tether, the leading stablecoin issuer with over $151 billion in assets, surpassed Germany in United States Treasury bill holdings. According to data from the US Department of the Treasury and Tether’s Q1 2025 attestation report, the firm now holds more than $120 billion in US Treasurys, placing it ahead of Germany’s $111.4 billion and ranking it as the 19th largest holder among all countries and entities. Countries holding US Treasury bills (Source: Treasury.gov ) The attestation report also revealed that Tether generated more than $1 billion in operating profit during the first quarter of 2025. This performance was driven primarily by its holdings in US Treasury bills, which are widely regarded as one of the safest and most liquid investment instruments globally. The firm shared that while the broader crypto market experienced downside volatility in Q1, its traditional asset reserves—including Treasury bills and gold—helped mitigate potential losses. In particular, the gains from gold investments nearly offset the impact of crypto-related fluctuations, which certainly helped confirm the strength of Tether’s asset mix . Tether’s expanding influence comes at a time when stablecoin regulation in the United States is in flux. Growing regulatory clarity could help boost demand for USDT, prompting the company to expand its reserves even more. Two key legislative proposals are at the center of the regulatory conversation. The STABLE Act, which aims to increase transparency and accountability for stablecoin issuers, has advanced through committee and is now awaiting a floor vote in the House. Meanwhile, the GENIUS Act, which focuses on stablecoin collateralization standards and anti-money laundering compliance, has stalled due to political resistance. Despite this, a strong show of support from top crypto founders in Washington, D.C., suggests that regulatory momentum may soon pick back up. US Stablecoin Law Still on Track The push for comprehensive stablecoin regulation in the United States is still going forward despite a recent setback in the Senate. Cody Carbone, CEO of the Digital Chamber, a prominent Washington-based blockchain advocacy group, is still very optimistic about the eventual passage of the GENIUS Act, formally titled the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation in US Stablecoins of 2025. Cody Carbone In an interview at Consensus 2025, Carbone explained that although the bill failed to pass a procedural vote earlier this month, it is only a temporary delay and not a derailment of momentum. According to him, the bill is likely to pass in the coming weeks, especially as Congress already moved faster on this issue than many expected. Carbone also talked about the bipartisan appeal of stablecoin regulation, and argued that protecting the US dollar's global dominance should be a shared goal across party lines. The GENIUS Act is seen as a crucial legislative framework that could shape the future of stablecoin issuance and compliance in the United States. Failing to pass meaningful reform before the 2026 midterm elections could potentially roll back the progress that was made in creating a favorable regulatory environment for digital assets. Despite the procedural hiccup on May 8, negotiations are ongoing, and advocates are hopeful that the revised version of the bill will find the necessary support in the Senate soon. Part of the GENIUS Act (Source: US Senate ) The initial failure of the bill was blamed on partisan disputes and growing controversy surrounding former President Donald Trump’s involvement in the crypto space. Several Democratic senators withdrew their support due to ethical concerns over Trump’s links to meme coins, NFTs, and decentralized finance. Coinbase’s chief legal officer Paul Grewal had similar concerns, and suggested Trump’s digital asset complicated the regulatory debate. In response, Republican Senator Tim Scott accused Democrats of allowing political motivations to obstruct necessary financial innovation. The most recent version of the GENIUS Act reportedly removes references to the Trump family in an attempt to push the legislation through. Industry insiders believe the revised bill could pass by the end of May. Tether Backs Major Bitcoin Play Meanwhile, Tether recently made a large Bitcoin purchase on behalf of Twenty One Capital, a Bitcoin-focused investment firm it backs. Tether bought nearly half a billion dollars' worth of BTC in anticipation of the company’s upcoming public debut. According to a US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing on May 13, Tether purchased 4,812.2 Bitcoin for $458.7 million at an average price of $95,319 per coin. The purchase was transferred into an escrow wallet on May 9, boosting Twenty One’s total Bitcoin holdings to 36,312 BTC. This positioned Twenty One as the third-largest corporate Bitcoin holder globally, behind only Strategy and MARA Holdings. Strategy holds approximately 568,840 BTC, while MARA controls around 48,237 BTC, according to BitcoinTreasuries.net . Once the firm completes its Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) merger with Cantor Equity Partners, it plans to trade under the ticker XXI. The merger is still undergoing regulatory approvals, though CEO Jack Mallers confirmed the process is underway. Tether, along with crypto exchange Bitfinex, holds a majority stake in Twenty One. The merger is being sponsored by Cantor Fitzgerald, a major Wall Street player providing financial advisory services and securing $585 million to help fund the firm’s growing Bitcoin portfolio. Japanese investment conglomerate SoftBank also threw its weight behind the venture by contributing $900 million. Together, Tether, SoftBank, and Bitfinex want to help Twenty One reach a total of 42,000 BTC before to its public listing, with Tether expected to contribute 23,950 BTC, SoftBank 10,500 BTC, and Bitfinex roughly 7,000 BTC in exchange for equity . In an April presentation, Twenty One laid out its ambition to surpass Strategy as the leading Bitcoin investment vehicle. It markets itself as a “pure play” for institutional and retail investors looking for capital-efficient Bitcoin exposure.

An impressive surge in buying over the past two weeks highlights growing investor confidence as this presale nears its close. Recent whale purchases of Solaxy ($SOLX) have totaled over $1M, with a significant $375K investment in a single whale purchase just today, adding to the already $37M+ raised so far. Large-scale buying like this hints $SOLX could be one of the best crypto presales to get into today. But first, what’s the reason for the $SOLX surge? And can it maintain its strong upward trend? Crypto Momentum: $SOLX in the Spotlight A series of significant announcements in the crypto space in recent months have sparked market enthusiasm and notable upticks across the board. For instance, positive shifts in the broader economic landscape, such as easing US-China trade tensions , have created a more favorable environment for digital assets. Major crypto milestones have added to the positive sentiment, including Bitcoin achieving its highest-ever weekly close. A landmark moment for the industry’s integration into the mainstream of finance was crypto company Coinbase’s recent debut in the S&P 500. Furthermore, strong performance from Ethereum has buoyed the altcoin market, all against a backdrop of steadily expanding adoption of digital currencies and tokenized assets. It’s clear these broad market catalysts and crypto achievements have injected new energy into the market. While substantial whale investments in a presale like $SOLX are a symptom of broader positive market trends, they’re also a clear vote of confidence that Solaxy is one of the new cryptos not to miss. Solaxy ($SOLX): Solana, Evolved The first-ever Layer 2 for Solana, Solaxy ($SOLX) , is set to redefine blockchain performance for Solana, the home of the best meme coins and the world’s third-largest crypto. Being a layer 2 blockchain, Solaxy neutralizes Solana’s pain points like network congestion, failed transactions, and scalability limitations. At the same time, it should amplify Solana’s core strengths, such as its incredible speed and low transaction fees. Solaxy offers a superior secondary platform for developers to build and interact with next-generation dApps seamlessly and cost-effectively. The goal is a faster, more reliable, and limitlessly scalable Solana. $SOLX: Your DeFi & Trading Edge At the center of Solaxy is the $SOLX token, your key to the enhanced ecosystem. This multi-chain token merges Ethereum’s deep liquidity and compatibility with Solana’s lightning speed, a dream for DeFi users and meme coin traders seeking the edge. Solaxy aims to democratize meme coin trading by putting powerful tools into everyday traders’ hands. High-performance Layer 2 infrastructure reduces costs and speeds up transactions. That gives everyday traders a real chance to compete in a market often dominated by whales and sophisticated, automated bots. Don’t miss the $SOLX presale selling for $0.001728, a 72.8% increase since the presale launch. Secure your tokens early and stake them for a dynamic APY of 107% today. Solaxy price predictions point to a potential high of $0.032 by the end of 2025, a staggering 3100% increase for those who invested in phase 1 of the presale. Get in while you can, as the ICO ends in 28 days. That said, don’t let FOMO steer your buying decisions.

2025-05-19T13:03:33.000Z,"Best Presale Crypto List: Nexchain, Solaxy & BTC Bull Token Stand Out","The post Best Presale Crypto List: Nexchain, Solaxy & BTC Bull Token Stand Out appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Presale tokens have become one of the hottest trends in crypto investing, offering early access to promising projects before they hit the mainstream. With the potential for high ROI and early-stage gains, more investors are eyeing these opportunities in 2025. Among the best presale crypto contenders this year, Nexchain leads the pack with real-world utility and powerful AI-backed infrastructure. Meanwhile, Solaxy and BTC Bull Token are also gaining attention for their unique approaches. As the momentum behind new crypto presales grows, these names are topping the list of top crypto presales 2025. Nexchain: Real Utility, Real Hype, Real Returns When it comes to crypto presale opportunities in 2025, Nexchain is in a league of its own. As the first Layer-1 AI-powered blockchain, it combines real-world utility with bleeding-edge tech, setting a new standard for scalability and decentralization. Nexchain boasts an incredible 400,000+ transactions per second (TPS) and ultra-low gas fees, made possible by its hybrid consensus mechanism. What truly sets it apart is its 10% daily gas fee revenue sharing model, which rewards holders with passive income in a way few other presales even attempt. Currently in Stage 12 of its presale, Nexchain has already raised over $2 million, with its token priced at $0.046. Experts are forecasting an expected ROI of 652%, making it one of the most talked-about high ROI crypto assets this year. Backed by a Certik audit and growing investor confidence, Nexchain is rapidly becoming the cornerstone of the best presale crypto lists. It’s no wonder seasoned investors are calling it “the one to watch” in the 2025 presale landscape. The Nexchain presale is more than hype, it’s a signal of serious potential. Solaxy: Green Energy Meets DeFi Solaxy is carving a unique niche in the world of best presale crypto by merging clean energy initiatives with decentralized finance. As climate concerns rise and investors seek purpose-driven assets, Solaxy brings an innovative solution: a blockchain-based ecosystem that rewards users for supporting renewable energy. Its mission is simple yet powerful: leverage DeFi to accelerate the adoption of sustainable practices worldwide. At the heart of Solaxy’s model are carbon credit rewards and a sustainable staking system, allowing users to earn passive income while reducing their carbon footprint. The project also features eco-focused tokenomics, ensuring that each transaction supports environmental projects and encourages long-term holding. For environmentally conscious investors and those exploring upcoming crypto launches with real-world impact, Solaxy offers both profitability and purpose. While Solaxy certainly stands out in the green crypto space, experts still point to Nexchain as the most well-rounded opportunity for long-term gains and mainstream adoption in 2025. It’s the blend of cutting-edge tech and real utility that keeps Nexchain at the top of every serious investor’s watchlist. BTC Bull Token: Meme Meets Market Timing BTC Bull Token is a classic example of a high-risk, high-reward crypto presale. Inspired by Bitcoin’s legendary status, this meme-driven project blends gamified tokenomics with viral branding to capture the attention of retail investors looking for the next breakout. With a rapidly growing online following and buzz on social platforms, BTC Bull Token is gaining traction among those chasing quick gains. Its appeal lies in its community-driven momentum, fun design, and timing as Bitcoin’s price trends upward in 2025. However, it’s important to note that BTC Bull Token leans heavily on hype and lacks the deep technical foundation or long-term use cases seen in more serious projects. As far as best presale crypto opportunities go, it may offer quick returns, but Nexchain remains the clear favorite for investors prioritizing real-world utility, audited security, and lasting impact. Final Thoughts Nexchain stands out among the best presale crypto of 2025 because of its innovative technology and usefulness. Nexchain combines fast transactions, hybrid consensus, and a proven revenue-sharing mechanism, while Solaxy focuses on sustainability, and BTC Bull Token leverages community engagement. These features make Nexchain a notable project to watch in the landscape of current crypto presale opportunities.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/best-presale-crypto-list-nexchain-solaxy-btc-bull-token-stand-out/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Press Release",cryptocompare

2025-05-19T13:00:00.000Z,"BounceBit Pilots Bitcoin Trading Strategy Using BlackRock's BUIDL as Collateral","BounceBit, a crypto infrastructure provider using features from both centralized (CeFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi), has executed a bitcoin (BTC) derivatives trading strategy using BlackRock's yield-generating tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, to enhance returns. The strategy, to be rolled out to institutions and retail users, consisted of two main components: a bitcoin basis trade, involving a long position in the spot market while shorting futures, and a short position in BTC put options, both collateralized by BUIDL tokens. The basis trade, also known as cash and carry arbitrage, alone generated an annualized yield of 4.7%, with put option writing contributing an additional 15%. Combined with the 4.25% return from BUIDL used as collateral, the total yield exceeded 24%. Integrating BUIDL as collateral helped generate a higher return than strategies collateralized by stablecoins, which do not generate any return. \""This strategy allows investors to capture both Treasury Bill yields and funding rate arbitrage returns,\"" Jack Lu, founder and CEO of BounceBit said in a press release exclusively shared with CoinDesk. \""BounceBit bridges the gap between Western real-world asset issuers and Asian crypto trading infrastructure, providing new options for yield generation,\"" Lu said. BounceBit is the native BTC restaking chain secured by staking both bitcoin and BounceBit tokens. The network allows BTC holders to earn yields through native validator staking, DeFi ecosystem and a CeFi-like mechanism powered by Ceffu and Mainnet Digital. As of writing, cryptocurrencies worth over $500 million were locked on BounceBit. BounceBit plans to roll out the BUIDL-collateralised strategy to institutional and retail users soon. \""The successful pilot is a proof of concept to our new product line BB Prime, which will be available to both retail and institutional users,\"" BounceBit's spokesperson told CoinDesk. \""This strategy underpins BB Prime as a new class of CeDeFi applications built on top of RWAs which are traditionally troubled by a lack of utilities beyond just holding for t-bill yield, hindering mass adoption,\"" the spokesperson added. BUIDL, launched in March 2024 by Securitize and BlackRock, is a tokenized investment fund operating on multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Aptos and Polygon. The token, currently boasting a market cap of $2.88 billion, is backed by short-term U.S. government bonds, boasting a stable value pegged at one dollar per token.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/19/bouncebit-pilots-bitcoin-trading-strategy-using-blackrocks-buidl-as-collateral,"BTC|MARKET|SPONSORED|TRADING|APT","Markets|Bitcoin|BlackRock|Buidl|Exclusive|News",cryptocompare

2025-05-19T12:50:40.000Z,"Crypto bull run intact despite weekend volatility in Bitcoin","Bitcoin saw a classic weekend pump-and-dump, with price now sitting at a critical support level. Despite the drop, the market structure remains bullish and poised for another breakout. Bitcoin ( BTC ) opened the week with a sharp retracement after an unsustainable Sunday rally pushed prices higher. The impulsive sell-off into Monday brought the asset back to a crucial support zone, yet the broader picture remains optimistic. Bitcoin continues to trade within a well-defined bullish channel, and the current correction is retesting key levels that could act as a launchpad for the next leg up. If this zone holds, there’s a strong case for Bitcoin pushing to new all-time highs in the coming days. Key technical points Bitcoin is still respecting its bullish ascending channel, holding higher highs and higher lows. Price is testing a support confluence zone at $102,790, the 0.618 Fibonacci, the VWAP, and the channel low. Bullish structure remains intact, despite the short-term volatility after the weekend spike. BTCUSDT (4H) Chart, Source: TradingView The corrective move seen over the past 24 hours is characteristic of weekend-driven volatility, where thin Sunday volume can lead to exaggerated price swings. While the pullback may seem dramatic on lower timeframes, it has delivered Bitcoin to a significant technical zone with multiple levels of confluence. This makes the current area not just a support level, but a potential accumulation zone. Importantly, the broader market structure remains bullish. Bitcoin continues to form higher highs and higher lows, and the ascending trading channel has held firm through the recent retracement. Holding this support region could establish the foundation for the next bullish rotation. Technically, it’s a high-probability zone for long setups, provided price consolidates and begins forming a base on intraday charts. You might also like: The new web3 paradigm: Why LayerK is built for a post-big tech internet From here, Bitcoin must stabilize above this support confluence and establish a bottoming formation, a typical precursor to renewed momentum. If successful, this would open the door to a move toward the channel’s upper boundary. That upper trendline, which hasn’t been tested during the current move, remains a likely price target if bullish momentum returns. What to expect in the coming price action Bitcoin continues to hold a bullish narrative despite recent weekend volatility. If current support levels remain intact, price is likely to rotate higher and make another attempt at all-time highs this week. A brief period of consolidation at these levels could represent the calm before the next breakout.

Companies maintain full custody throughout the process, and smart contracts used are audited to reduce risk.“The problem that Franklin solves for is two-fold,” Megan Knab, founder and CEO of Franklin, told Cointelegraph. For companies that have already integrated crypto onto their balance sheets, Franklin helps them use those assets to manage their operations, she said.“But for the broader market, we are enabling business models of the future, where money moves instantly, more intelligently, and to more globally,” Knab added.Source: FranklinRelated: PayPal to offer 3.7% yield on stablecoin balances: ReportAlternative to T-BillsFranklin said its new offering is an alternative to traditional treasury tools like sweep accounts or T-bills, which often involve operational complexity and limited returns.Furthermore, it differentiates from earned wage access (EWA) platforms, which enable employees to access their earned wages before their scheduled payday by avoiding additional debt and associated costs.“Traditional payments in the next decade will run entirely on public blockchain rails as a wholesale replacement to ACH and SWIFT,” Knab said.She added that if onchain payroll products go mainstream, banks could fade into the background. While technology may replace many banking functions with self-custody tools and smart contracts, regulatory frameworks will still require accountable legal entities.The result may be “zombie-like institutions” — banks in name only, existing to meet compliance rules but playing a minimal role in actual payment processing, Knab said.However, decentralized lending comes with risks like smart contract vulnerabilities and market fluctuations. Franklin said it aims to mitigate these by using Summer.fi’s audited contracts and overcollateralized lending.Related: How to Use tsUSDe on TON for Passive Dollar Yield in 2025Rising interest in yield-generating strategiesInterest in yield-generating strategies within the cryptocurrency sector has surged in recent years, driven by both retail and institutional investors seeking to maximize returns on their digital assets.On May 16, Solv Protocol launched a yield-bearing Bitcoin token on the Avalanche blockchain, giving institutional investors more exposure to yield opportunities backed by real-world assets, or RWAs.On May 1, Ryan Chow, co-founder and CEO of Solv Protocol, said the demand for yield-generating strategies around Bitcoin is surging, especially from firms seeking liquidity without liquidating their BTC.Magazine: Arthur Hayes $1M Bitcoin tip, altcoins’ powerful rally’ looms: Hodler’s Digest, May 11 – 17",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/franklin-launches-payroll-treasury-yield-defi?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

It consists of three peaks: a higher peak (head) and two lower peaks (shoulders). It is resolved when the price breaks below the neckline (the line connecting the lows of the left and right shoulder), confirming the pattern and suggesting a potential sell signal.In XRP’s case, the pattern was validated following a break and close below the neckline at $2.33 during the early Asian trading hours on May 19. If the price stays below the neckline, the XRP/USD pair could slide further to $2.25 (where the 200-day simple moving average currently sits) and then to the pattern target of $2.00. This would bring the total losses to 14% from the current levels.XRP/USD four-hour chart.

2025-05-19T11:49:01.000Z,"Australian court ruling could lead to $640M in Bitcoin tax refunds","A court decision in Australia could open the door to as much as $640 million in capital gains tax (CGT) refunds on Bitcoin transactions after a judge ruled that crypto should be treated as money rather than a taxable asset. On May 19, the Australian Financial Review (AFR) reported that the decision arose within a criminal case involving federal police officer William Wheatley, who allegedly stole 81.6 Bitcoin (BTC) in 2019. At the time, the assets were worth roughly $492,000. At current market prices, the tokens are valued at more than $13 million.In the case, Judge Michael O’Connell of Victoria ruled that Bitcoin qualifies as a form of money rather than property, likening the digital asset to Australian dollars rather than to shares, gold or foreign currency.The interpretation could set a legal precedent, potentially placing Bitcoin transactions outside the scope of Australia’s current CGT regime.  New court ruling challenges Australian crypto tax lawsIn an AFR interview, tax lawyer Adrian Cartland said the verdict “totally upends” the Australian Taxation Office’s (ATO) current position. Since 2014, the ATO has classified crypto assets as CGT assets. This means that users must pay tax when selling or trading them. Under the ATO’s guidance, any disposal of Bitcoin, including selling it for fiat, exchanging it for another crypto or using it to purchase goods or services, constitutes a CGT event. This framework has been the basis for taxing cryptocurrency transactions in Australia for over a decade. However, the recent ruling challenges the approach by suggesting that Bitcoin functions more like money than property. This potentially exempts it from CGT.Related: Australian feds seize mansion, Bitcoin allegedly linked to crypto exchange hackTax refunds could reach $640 millionCartland said it was held that Bitcoin is Australian money. “That is, it is not a CGT asset. Therefore, acquisitions and disposals of Bitcoin have no tax consequences,” the tax lawyer added. If the ruling is upheld on the appeal, Cartland estimates that there could be potential tax refunds totalling 1 billion Australian dollars ($640 million). However, while Cartland thinks there could be up to a billion in refunds, the ATO said there were no official figures that confirm the amount to be potentially refunded if the case changes how Bitcoin is taxed in Australia. Magazine: Binance Wallet ‘killing’ MetaMask and airdrops, Chinese RWA tokens: Asia Express",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/australia-bitcoin-tax-ruling-cgt-refunds?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

This includes advisory, broker-dealer, custody, exchange, lending and borrowing, virtual asset (VA) management and investment, and VA transfer and settlement services. A VARA spokesperson told Cointelegraph that the updates will bring consistency across all activity-based rules defining core operational terms. The spokesperson gave examples of terms like “client assets,” “qualified custodians,” and “collateral requirements” as some of the terms more consistently defined in the update.  The update also aligned risk management and disclosure obligations, where activities overlap, in areas like brokerage, custody and exchange. “The aim was to reduce ambiguity and help VASPs navigate cross-functional compliance more easily,” VARA told Cointelegraph. Related: Dubai gov’t agencies to link real estate registry with property tokenizationDubai regulator tightens leverage thresholds for margin tradingAs for margin trading, the VARA spokesperson said they tightened leverage thresholds, mandated clearer collateralisation standards, and enhanced the monitoring obligations for VASPs offering this feature. Margin trading allows traders to control large positions with smaller amounts of capital. It amplifies both gains and losses. Tightening the leverage traders use helps limit the risks of widespread liquidations in a market downturn. The crypto regulator introduced a new section on token distribution that sets out licensing prerequisites, investor protections and marketing restrictions.

2025-05-19T08:55:00.000Z,"Crypto drainers as a service: What you need to know","What is a crypto drainer?              A crypto drainer is a malicious script designed to steal cryptocurrency from your wallet. Unlike regular phishing attacks that try to capture login credentials, a crypto drainer tricks you into connecting your wallets, such as MetaMask or Phantom, and unknowingly authorizing transactions that grant them access to your funds.Disguised as a legitimate Web3 project, a crypto drainer is usually promoted via compromised social media accounts or Discord groups. Once you fall prey to the fraud, the drainer can instantly transfer assets from the wallet.Crypto drainers may take various forms:Malicious smart contracts that initiate unauthorized transfers.Fake NFTs or token systems that create deceptive exchanges or assets.Crypto drainers are a growing threat in Web3, enabling quick, automated theft of crypto assets from unsuspecting users through deception. Common methods of crypto drainers include: Phishing websites.Fake airdrops.Deceptive ads.Malicious smart contracts.Harmful browser extensions.Fake NFT marketplaces.                  Crypto drainers-as-a-service (DaaS), explained              DaaS elevates the threat of crypto drainers by commercializing them. Just like  software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms, DaaS platforms sell ready-to-use malware kits to cybercriminals, often in exchange for a percentage of the stolen funds.In the DaaS model, developers offer turnkey draining scripts, customizable phishing kits and even integration help in exchange for a share of the stolen funds. A DaaS offer might be bundled with social engineering support, anonymization services and regular updates, making them attractive even to low-skill scammers.Types of crypto DaaS tools include:JavaScript-based drainers: Malicious JavaScript is embedded into phishing websites that mimic legitimate decentralized apps (DApps). These scripts execute when you connect your wallet, silently triggering approval transactions that drain assets. Token approval malware: Tricks users into granting unlimited token access via malicious smart contracts.Clipboard hijackers: Hackers use clipboard hijackers to monitor and replace copied wallet addresses with those controlled by attackers. Info-stealers: They harvest browser data, wallet extensions and private keys. Some DaaS packages combine these with loader malware that drops additional payloads or updates the malicious code. Modular drainer kits: Segregated into modules, these drainers use obfuscation techniques to bypass browser-based security tools. Did you know? According to Scam Sniffer, phishing campaigns using wallet drainers siphoned off over $295 million in NFTs and tokens from unsuspecting users in 2023.                  What crypto DaaS kits include              Crypto DaaS kits are pre-built toolsets sold to scammers, enabling them to steal digital assets with minimal technical skill. These kits typically include phishing page templates, malicious smart contracts, wallet-draining scripts and more.This is what crypto DaaS kits generally include:Pre-built drainer software: Plug-and-play malware requiring minimal setup.Phishing kits: DaaS providers supply customizable phishing website templates that hackers can modify according to their plans.Social engineering: With DaaS, hackers find support for social engineering along with psychological tactics to trick users into connecting their wallets.Operational security (OPSEC) tools: To avoid detection, some DaaS vendors offer advanced operational security tools that mask user identity and hide digital footprints.Integration assistance and/obfuscation: These services help attackers deploy drainer scripts seamlessly and use obfuscation tools to evade tracking.Regular updates: Frequent improvements are designed to bypass wallet defenses and detection systems.User-friendly dashboards: Control panels that help attackers oversee operations and monitor drained funds.Documentation and tutorials: Step-by-step instructions enabling even beginners to execute scams efficiently.Customer support: Some DaaS operators provide real-time help through secure messaging apps like Telegram.With DaaS kits available for as little as $100 to $500, or through subscription models, sophisticated crypto attacks are no longer limited to experienced hackers. Even the inexperienced can now access these scripts with a small budget, effectively democratizing this type of crime.Did you know? Advanced DaaS tools often update scripts to evade detection from browser extensions like WalletGuard and security alerts issued by MetaMask or Trust Wallet.                  Evolution of crypto drainers as prominent fraudulent activity              The threat landscape of cryptocurrency fraud is constantly evolving. Emerging around 2021, crypto drainers have rapidly transformed the landscape. Their ability to stealthily siphon funds from users' wallets has made them a threat that demands vigilance.Drainers specifically designed to target MetaMask began to emerge around 2021 and were openly advertised on illicit online forums and marketplaces.Here are some prominent drainers that have been around for some time:Chick Drainer: It emerged in late 2023, targeting Solana (SOL) users through phishing campaigns. It operates using the CLINKSINK script, embedded in fake airdrop websites.Rainbow Drainer: The platform shares code similarities with Chick Drainer, suggesting potential reuse or collaboration among threat actors.Angel Drainer: Launched around August 2023, Angel Drainer is widely promoted on Telegram by threat groups like GhostSec. Affiliate scammers need to make an upfront payment between $5,000 and $10,000 and also pay a 20% commission on all stolen assets facilitated through its platform.Rugging’s Drainer: Compatible with several crypto platforms, this DaaS drainer offers comparatively low commission fees, typically ranging from 5% to 10% of the stolen proceeds. In the wake of the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s X account being compromised in January 2024, Chainalysis found a crypto drainer acting as the SEC. This led users to connect their wallets in an attempt to claim nonexistent airdropped tokens.According to a Kaspersky Security Bulletin, dark web threads discussing crypto drainers rose sharply in 2024, jumping by 135% to 129 threads from 55 in 2022. These conversations encompass a wide range of topics, including buying and selling malicious software and forming distribution teams.As the following chart demonstrates, crypto drainers have been stealing crypto at a faster quarterly growth rate than even ransomware.                  Red flags to identify a crypto DaaS attack              Spotting a crypto wallet drainer attack early is crucial to minimizing potential losses and securing your assets. You must be careful, as a sophisticated drainer attack can sometimes evade standard alert mechanisms. You must remain vigilant even while relying on automated tools. Here are a few indicators that your wallet may be under threat:Unusual transactions: A red flag of a drainer attack is finding transactions you didn’t authorize. These may include unexpected token transfers or withdrawals to unknown wallet addresses. Sometimes, attackers execute multiple small transfers to avoid detection, so you must monitor for repeated unusual transactions of low-value crypto. Lost access to wallet: If you cannot access your wallet or your funds are missing, it could mean an attacker has taken control. This often happens when the drainer changes private keys or recovery phrases, effectively locking you out. Security alerts from wallet providers: Your crypto wallet may issue security alerts for suspicious actions, like logins from new devices, failed access attempts or unauthorized transactions. These warnings indicate that someone may be trying to access your wallet or has already accessed it.Fake project websites or DApps: If you find a cloned or newly launched platform mimicking a real Web3 service and prompting wallet connections, it is a warning sign of a crypto drainer. It might also have urgent calls to action, urging users to immediately claim rewards, airdrops, or mint NFTs. The objective is to pressure victims into connecting wallets without verifying authenticity.Unverified social media promotions: Suspicious links shared via X, Discord, Telegram or Reddit, often unverified profiles, indicate a fraudulent attempt to drain money from a wallet. Fraudsters may also use compromised accounts to share malicious links. Unaudited smart contracts: Interacting with unfamiliar contracts without public audits or GitHub transparency can expose wallets to hidden drainer scripts.Wallet prompts requesting broad permissions: Sign-in or approval requests that ask for full token spending access or access to all assets, rather than specific transactions, are serious warning signs.Did you know? Just one popular drainer kit can be used by hundreds of affiliates. That means a single DaaS platform can be behind thousands of wallet thefts in a matter of days.                  How to protect your crypto wallet from DaaS attackers              To protect your crypto wallet from DaaS attackers, adopting strong, proactive security practices is essential. Blockchain monitoring tools can help identify suspicious patterns linked to drainer activity, allowing you to respond quickly. Here are key strategies to help protect your digital assets:Use hardware wallets: Hardware wallets, or cold wallets, store private keys offline, shielding them from online threats like malware and phishing. Keeping your keys in a physical device significantly lowers the risk of remote attacks and is ideal for securing long-term crypto holdings.Enable 2FA (two-factor authentication): Adding 2FA to your wallet means even if someone steals your password, they will need a second verification step. They need to put in a verification code sent to your phone to access the account, along with your password, making unauthorized access much harder.Avoid phishing links: Always verify URLs and avoid clicking on unsolicited messages claiming rewards or updates. Never input private keys or seed phrases on suspicious sites. When in doubt, manually enter the correct website address.Secure your private keys and seed phrases: Store your private keys and seed phrases offline in a safe, physical location. Never save these credentials on internet-connected devices, or hackers might get access to them, putting your wallet at risk. Verify apps and browser extensions: Take care to install software only from official sources. Research apps beforehand to avoid malicious or fake tools.Monitor wallet activity regularly: Check your wallet for unauthorized transactions or unusual patterns. Early detection can help stop further losses and improve recovery chances.                  What to do if you suffer from a crypto-drainer attack              Swift action is essential if you suspect your crypto wallet has been compromised. Though fund recovery is rare, quick action can limit further losses.Here are the steps you need to take if you suffer from a crypto DaaS attack:Secure your accounts: Immediately change the password for your wallet and enable 2FA, if you still have access to it. Transfer any remaining funds to a secure, uncompromised wallet.Notify your wallet provider or exchange: Report the incident to your wallet provider or exchange. You could request them to monitor your account or freeze suspicious activity. Platforms may flag suspicious addresses or prevent further transfers.File a report with authorities: Contact local law enforcement or cybercrime units, as cryptocurrency theft is treated as a financial crime in most regions.Seek professional assistance: Cybersecurity firms specializing in blockchain forensics can analyze transactions and potentially trace the stolen funds. While full recovery is unlikely, especially if assets pass through mixers or bridges, expert help may aid investigations.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/crypto-drainers-as-a-service-what-you-need-to-know?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The team claimed to have immediately responded and taken action involving multiple departments, including the firm’s chief operating officer, Helen Liu.Other people involved in the operation were the heads of customer service, risk control, the Chinese-language division, product managers and the technical team. The exchange coordinated its actions with the user.After an internal investigation, Bybit concluded this was a “unique case affecting an individual user, not a systemic issue.” The account’s KYC information was not tampered with and the funds in the account remained secure at all times.Bybit had not answered Cointelegraph’s request for comment at the time of writing.Related: A decade-old debate is back as self-custody gets smarterThe perks of media attentionBybit claims to have taken large-scale and timely action, which involved a member of its executive team, all in response to an issue reported by a single user. Chinese-speaking X crypto influencer EnHeng claimed to be the reason for this.In a separate post that Bybit’s X post answers to — EnHeng explained that in a group chat, he noticed “a girl mentioned a bug related to Bybit’s Apple ID.” He verified the issue and after confirming that it was real, flagged it to Bybit.EnHeng said that the staff responded quickly and assisted the user in recovering access to about $100,000 worth of funds. They highlighted:“This incident really made me feel the value of having influence.”EnHeng said “in this market, retail investors often lack a voice and are vulnerable.” For this reason, he said, “When we have more resources and a bigger voice, we should use them to speak up for retail investors.”Related: Self-custody vs. centralized crypto cards: Freedom or convenience?Locked out of exchangeBeing locked out of a cryptocurrency exchange account or some of its features is not excessively uncommon. Often, it is an emergency measure meant to prevent fund losses.A recent example is Phemex crypto exchange halting withdrawals after being alerted to nearly $30 million worth of suspicious outflows that raised alarms among blockchain security firms in late January. Indian cryptocurrency exchange Mudrex temporarily halted crypto withdrawals during the same month, claiming compliance improvements were the reason.Sometimes action is taken on the request of law enforcement. Last summer, a small set of Palestinian user accounts was frozen after Israeli authorities issued a seizure request. Also last summer, OKX warned it would terminate any account linked to crypto mixer Tornado Cash or sanctioned addresses, and several users said their log-ins were suddenly disabled.Those incidents echo an old adage popular in the Bitcoin (BTC) community: Not your keys, not your coins.

2025-05-19T07:55:20.000Z,"Vitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes for Ethereum scaling","Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin unveiled a proposal to preserve trustless, censorship-resistant access to Ethereum, even as the network scales. On May 19, Buterin shared a post outlining how to make Ethereum's layer-1 scaling “more friendly” to users running local nodes for personal use. The Ethereum co-founder highlighted the importance of independent users running nodes, saying that a market dominated by a few Remote Procedure Call (RPC) providers risks censorship. RPC providers let wallets, users and apps interact with the blockchain without running their own nodes. Crypto wallets are usually connected to an RPC provider behind the scenes. Buterin believes there are risks to this setup. “A market structure dominated by a few RPC providers is one that will face strong pressure to deplatform or censor users. Many RPC providers already exclude entire countries,” Buterin wrote. Source: Vitalik ButerinVitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes In addition to censorship, Buterin argued that reasons like expensive fully-trustless cryptographic solutions and metadata privacy show that there’s value in ensuring greater ease for those running a personal node. In the proposal, Buterin's solution relies on a novel type of node called “partially stateless nodes.” These nodes are designed to help users maintain privacy-preserving access to blockchain data without the heavy resource demands of running a full node. As Ethereum scales and the gas limit increases, running a full node requires more storage and bandwidth. Buterin said partially stateless nodes address the issue by allowing users to verify the blockchain and serve local data, but only store a subset of the Ethereum state, based on the user’s needs.Vitalik Buterin’s graphic of partially stateless nodes. Source: Vitalik ButerinRelated: Ethereum Foundation unveils security initiative to supplant legacy systemsA new node type to validate blocks “statelessly”The nodes would operate by validating blocks statelessly. This means they don't require the storage of the full Merkle proofs or the entire blockchain history. They can selectively keep certain parts of the state up to date. This means that users could configure their nodes only to save data related to their accounts, the decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, and their commonly used tokens like stablecoins and Ether (ETH). The rest of the data will be left out, and queries beyond the stored subset will fail or be routed through an RPC solution. Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/vitalik-buterin-partially-stateless-nodes-ethereum-scaling-privacy?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-19T07:38:51.000Z,"How to read a Bitcoin liquidation map (without getting liquidated)","Understanding a Bitcoin liquidation map is imperative in dealing with the inherent volatility of the crypto market. The visual tool showcases probable liquidation levels, indicating where large orders may cause cascading price changes. This post explores how to interpret a Bitcoin liquidation map, allowing you to trade smarter in the volatile world of cryptocurrency.What is liquidation in crypto trading?In cryptocurrency trading, liquidation happens when an exchange forcefully closes a trader's leveraged position due to insufficient margin to pay losses. This usually occurs when the market moves sharply against the position. Long liquidations occur when prices fall, affecting traders who bet on an uptrend. Short liquidations happen when prices unexpectedly rise, impacting those who bet on a decline. Did you know? In crypto, a single liquidation cascade can wipe out millions in minutes, triggered not by hacking but by traders using too much leverage at the wrong time.What is a Bitcoin liquidation map?A Bitcoin liquidation map is a visual heatmap indicating price levels where large liquidations are expected to occur. These maps assist traders in identifying zones where leveraged positions may be closed forcibly if prices fluctuate sharply. Tools like CoinGlass provide real-time Bitcoin (BTC) liquidation maps, valuable resources for risk-aware traders. With the liquidation map, you canUse breakout trading strategies for profitable scalping opportunities.Set stop-loss levels based on key liquidation zones for better risk management.Target high-liquidity areas to secure profits efficiently.Enter large trades near liquidity clusters to minimize slippage and enhance execution.Analyze the gradient of liquidation intensity to anticipate potential price movements..Functioning of a liquidation map and key components The X-axis of the liquidation chart represents the bid price, while the Y-axis denotes the relative strength of liquidation activity. Each column on the graphic illustrates a liquidation cluster's relative significance compared to other clusters.The chart demonstrates how the market will respond if the price reaches certain thresholds. Taller liquidation bars indicate a higher potential impact. The various hues are solely for visual clarity, allowing users to distinguish between distinct liquidation zones.Here are the main components of a liquidation map:Heat zones: Indicate where most positions could be eliminated if the price reaches specific levels.Liquidity pools: Collections of stop-loss and liquidation orders that can cause rapid price movements.Open interest levels: Demonstrate where large amounts of leveraged positions are concentrated.Price imbalances or gaps: Disclose areas without support or resistance, allowing prices to move swiftly.Did you know? Crypto liquidations often follow the herd; when too many traders place similar bets, liquidation maps light up and whales use them as price targets.How to use a liquidation map in your Bitcoin trading strategyA Bitcoin liquidation map provides insights into probable price movements and risk zones by visually representing places where leveraged positions will likely be closed. Here is how to use a liquidation map in Bitcoin trading:Identify high-risk zones: Identify places with dense liquidation clusters to avoid overleveraging. These areas come across as magnets, attracting price changes that might cause a series of liquidations.Time entry and exit: Liquidation clusters help find the optimal entry and exit points. Entering and exiting trades before a cluster becomes risky helps you lock in profits before reversals.Combine with technical indicators: Enhance your research by combining liquidation maps with tools such as support/resistance levels and relative strength index (RSI). This sets out a comprehensive view of market conditions.Avoid herd mentality: Exercise caution in places with high leverage concentrations. Such zones may be traps constructed by larger players to induce liquidations and profit from the resulting volatility.Monitor whale activity: Large traders frequently target liquidation zones to turn price moves to their advantage. Observing these patterns can provide insights about prospective market movements.Anticipate reversals: Markets frequently experience reversals following large liquidation events. Recognizing these trends can aid in positioning for possible rebounds.Implement robust risk management: Use stop-loss orders and handle leverage carefully. Liquidation maps can help you determine where to put these orders to minimize exposure.Common mistakes to avoid when using the Bitcoin liquidation mapUsing a Bitcoin liquidation map can enhance trading decisions, but misinterpretation can lead to costly errors. Here are common mistakes you need to avoid:Blindly trading toward liquidity zones: If you are trading toward liquidity zones without thinking, expect reversals.Misreading map colors or scale: Making a mistake in judging map colors or scale can skew your risk assessment.Over-relying on liquidation data without context: Maps are valuable tools, not an assurance that what they reflect will happen.Ignoring macro news or sentiment analysis: External events often override technical signals. A sudden event may make all predictions fall flat.Always combine liquidation maps with broader technical analysis. Smart trading requires context, not just colorful charts.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Source: PACERCoinbase reported on May 15 that four days earlier it had been hit with a $20 million extortion attempt after cybercriminals bribed several of its customer support agents to access internal systems and steal a limited amount of user account data.The stolen data included names, addresses, phone numbers, emails, the last four digits of Social Security numbers, some bank account identifiers, driver’s licenses, passports and some account data, such as balance snapshots and transaction history.Bender claimed that “Coinbase failed to implement and maintain reasonable security safeguards,” which exposed users to “serious and ongoing risks.”The suit also claimed Coinbase’s response to the incident was “inadequate, fragmented, and delayed.”“Users were not promptly or fully informed of the compromise, and Coinbase did not immediately take meaningful steps to mitigate further harm,  provide identity protection services, or offer actionable guidance to affected individuals,” the complaint claimed.The lawsuit claimed users could face “substantial, immediate, and ongoing threat of identity theft and financial fraud” and that the consequences of the breach could be long-term or “potentially permanent” because the compromised information can’t be recovered or made secure once exposed.Flurry of lawsuits make similar allegations Two other lawsuits filed in a New York federal court made similar claims against Coinbase, while a fourth lawsuit added the allegation of unjust enrichment, arguing that Coinbase didn’t spend enough on data security measures.All four complaints ask for damages and other measures to help protect the plaintiff’s sensitive data.Meanwhile, a fifth lawsuit filed in a California federal court on May 15 made similar claims against Coinbase, but asked the court to order Coinbase to purge all sensitive data it holds about the plaintiffs and hire third-party security auditors to test its security systems, among other requests.A Coinbase spokesperson did not comment on the lawsuits and instead pointed Cointelegraph to a blog post it shared regarding the data breaches.Coinbase said it refused to pay the $20 million ransom and has flagged plans to reimburse users tricked into sending crypto to phishing scammers due to the data breach.In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the exchange said it expects reimbursement expenses ranging from $180 million to $400 million.Related: Retired artist loses $2M in crypto to Coinbase impersonatorThe exchange also reportedly fired a group of customer support agents based in India following their alleged involvement in social engineering attacks on users.Coinbase (COIN) shares dipped 7% and dropped to $244 after it disclosed the data breach along with an ongoing SEC probe over misstated user numbers in 2021.The stock has since staged a comeback, spiking 9% and hitting $266 by the closing bell on May 16, according to Google Finance. Coinbase has climbed even higher following the data breach.

2025-05-19T05:42:26.000Z,"‘Sats’ vs ‘bits’ debate reignites amid proposal to change Bitcoin base unit","A recent proposal that aims to change Bitcoin’s base unit to make it easier to understand as a payment tool has run into opposition, with critics saying Bitcoin’s satoshis are no more confusing than the dollar’s cents. Bitcoin developer John Carvalho introduced Bitcoin Improvement Proposal-177 on April 23, which seeks to eliminate the concept of satoshis, of which there are 100,000,000 in 1 Bitcoin (BTC), and effectively split Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million into 21 quadrillion units.It follows a 2017 proposal from Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song to create “bits,” representing one-millionth of 1 Bitcoin.

2025-05-18T15:00:00.000Z,"Don’t believe the noise: There can never be too many L2s","Opinion by: Igor Mandrigin, co-founder and CTPO of Gateway.fmEvery couple of weeks, it seems another layer 2 rolls out, much to the chagrin of some Web3 industry commentators who are concerned about fragmentation. A recent Gemini Institutional Insights report actually noted how a new Ethereum L2 solution is launched approximately every 19 days. In response to the seemingly endless conveyor belt of new zkEVMs and optimistic rollups coming to market, the chorus of criticism continues to grow louder: “This is definitely the saturation point, no more chains are needed.”Some of the most outspoken critics of L2s argue that L2s are redundant, but this is narrow thinking. In many ways, the idea that creating new L2s should be slowed down is like arguing that there were too many websites in 1998. The proliferation of L2s is not causing the Web3 space to become overly bloated or fragmented at all. The number of chains today isn’t too many. It’s laughably few, and right now is the early innings of a multi-decade explosion in specialized, modular blockchain infrastructure.The rise of L2s is far from a passing fadWhile some contend that this L2 surge we’ve been experiencing is merely a temporary frenzy led by DeFi degenerates, it’s really an enterprise-grade infrastructure expansion, as banks (including Deutsche Bank), game studios (gaming activity on some L2 blockchains rose by over 20,000% in February 2025), logistics networks and global manufacturers get on board. Industries like banking and logistics, which are typically risk-averse, don’t make major tech pivots lightly. They do so because they have to, and in many cases, public blockchains do not meet their needs. Returning to their inherent risk-averse DNA, large enterprises and institutions in these sectors generally won’t want to build on shared, general-purpose L1s. Instead, they’ll want to deploy their own chains where they can enjoy custom performance, predictable costs, jurisdictional compliance and granular-level privacy.This focus on proprietary networks isn’t solely a Web3 thing. Let’s think about it. Did Facebook, Netflix and JPMorgan co-host on GeoCities? Of course not, so why would Web3 be any different? Shared L1s and monolithic architectures might have worked for early token experiments and composable DeFi primitives. Still, realistically, they can’t support real-world businesses’ complexity, regulatory burden or contractual requirements.The growing viability of L2sThanks to modular stacks, rollup-as-a-service platforms and breakthrough zero-knowledge proof technology, spinning up a dedicated chain is becoming increasingly viable and accessible to a wide range of enterprises across the industry spectrum. As the infrastructure improves, the cost of launching and maintaining specialized chains will also reduce, so a substantial rise in the number of L2s can be expected as time goes on.Recent: Devs introduce Ethereum R1 layer-2 scaling solutionSome onlookers will argue that this future will be convoluted for users forced to hop between chains while voicing concerns about liquidity fragmentation and the dispersal of tradable assets across multiple platforms. These are short-sighted concerns. We’re building toward seamless interoperability through shared settlement layers, trust-minimized bridges and unified account abstraction. Ultimately, the end-user won’t care whether they’re on rollup #4,318 or chain #9,072; they’ll just transact with ease and be happy with that. In the same way that cloud computing unlocked hyper scale by abstracting the hardware layer, modular blockchains are unlocking hyperscale for value transfer, asset issuance and programmable trust. Irrespective of what the doubters say, specialized L2s won’t cannibalize each other. They’ll serve different verticals, jurisdictions and use cases. There is no reason why an L2 for high-frequency trading can’t easily coexist with an L2 for national land registries.We’re not drowning in chains — we’re barely ankle-deep in the grand scheme of things. Anyone seriously betting on consolidation or some magical “winner-take-all” chain is just betting against scale and sovereignty. The real bet is hundreds of L2s and thousands of use cases as part of one modular, scalable future.Opinion by: Igor Mandrigin, co-founder and CTPO of Gateway.fm.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

He pushed for a configurable, default policy discouraging the use of Bitcoin for storing JPEGs rather than monetary data.Blockstream CEO Adam Back challenged the proposal, describing inscription filtering as an “arms race.” He noted that spam data embedded in Bitcoin transactions can be endlessly modified using code structures, requiring constant updates to filtering tools.Source: Adam BackRelated: Bitcoin Ordinals vs. Ethereum NFTs: A comparative overviewAmmous compares Bitcoin spam to emailAmmous compared the Bitcoin spam issue to email spam — another arms race society continues to fight without abandoning the system.“It’s not easy, but it’s worth trying to help bankrupt the spammers faster,” Ammous said. He argued that fighting spam is not censorship, noting that node operators already reject invalid transactions.“So a node runner looking to remove retards' spam is no less valid than retards' spam,” he added.The debate drew commentary from other users. One participant suggested Core developers treat spam-coding employees at certain startups as “unwilling QA engineers” and simply unstandardize every trick they deploy.Ammous took it further, proposing to “deprecate” the work of developers building spam tools and even hiring outside coders to overwhelm their systems.Source: Saifedean AmmousThe conversation reflects ongoing tensions in the Bitcoin community over the network’s intended use. With inscriptions continuing to congest the network, calls for technical countermeasures — and pointed critiques of those defending spam — are growing louder.In a Feb. 4 report, Mempool Research said the adoption of inscriptions could drive the Bitcoin network’s average block size as high as 4 megabytes (MB) per block, far higher than current averages.Bitcoin’s average block size — the amount of data in each block posted to the network’s public ledger — is currently around 1.5 MB.Magazine: Arthur Hayes $1M Bitcoin tip, altcoins’ powerful rally’ looms: Hodler’s Digest, May 11 – 17",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/saifedean-ammous-funds-dev-to-fight-bitcoin-spam?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

For locals, Bitcoin (BTC) offers a hedge against inflation, protection from currency volatility and new economic opportunities.Here’s a taste of what a Bitcoin-friendly trip along the Garden Route is like.The Garden Route is where Bitcoin meets paradiseThe Garden Route is one of South Africa’s premier tourist corridors. It stretches roughly 300 kilometers from Mossel Bay in the west to the Storms River Mouth in the east, attracting hundreds of thousands of tourists yearly.Crypto adoption is escalating thanks to South Africa’s regulatory environment, which now recognizes Bitcoin as a financial product. Across the Garden Route, you can spend pre-acquired Bitcoin freely, with little concern for local tax or exchange controls.It’s a grassroots movement. Towns like Witsand and Plettenberg Bay are at the forefront, and national retailers like Pick n Pay provide a safety net for crypto spending along the way. Every Pick n Pay store, including supermarkets, clothing outlets and Express convenience stores, accepts Bitcoin via the CryptoQR app. This guarantees you can always buy daily goods with Bitcoin wherever you travel. Related: Stablecoin fever: 5 major stablecoins are growing crypto adoptionWitsand is the Bitcoin villageLocated at the mouth of the Breede River, Witsand is a sleepy coastal town with a big reputation in the Bitcoin world. Here, Bitcoin isn’t just accepted — it’s preferred.It’s thanks to the efforts of local champions like Edwin Jones, a software engineer and passionate supporter of Bitcoin adoption in the Garden Route. Witsand has become a functioning Bitcoin circular economy. Accommodation options like Fantasea and Happy Days holiday homes, meals at Ellie’s on Main, groceries at local shops, gym memberships, boat services, petrol, surf lessons and mini-golf can be paid for using Bitcoin.As Jones notes: Bitcoin Witsand existed long before we gave it a name. It was just having conversations with friends, and as the local businesses started understanding Bitcoin, they actually demanded we start getting the technology in place.The town’s small and close-knit community has enabled rapid adoption; more than 45 establishments accept Bitcoin as of early 2025. The town’s enthusiasm is infectious, as locals and visitors enjoy the ease and security of digital payments.Witsand proudly announces its acceptance of Bitcoin. Source: Edwin JonesWitsand’s success as a Bitcoin hub is rooted in its community-driven approach. Jones outlines its growth by outlining that: Although there have been many individual businesses over the years since 2009 that started and stopped accepting Bitcoin for the Garden Route, the adoption really started kicking off in 2021.“With the Lightning Network starting to reach maturity around that time, the first Spaza Shop in Mossel Bay, Bitcoin Ekasi, started accepting Bitcoin in August 2021, and the first restaurant in Witsand in December of the same year.”Education has been central to the process. Local advocates have focused on teaching business owners the fundamentals of Bitcoin, warning against scams and emphasizing the difference between Bitcoin and speculative altcoins. “With all the circular economies advocating against gambling and trading, cautioning against interest and investments, being explicitly Bitcoin, and focusing on the fundamentals rather than the price, scammers have been kept at bay,” Jones said. “We have also found that businesses don’t have to adapt as much as evolve.”Bitcoin doesn’t change a business — it just supercharges it. Doing the same old things, much better.Mossel Bay’s surf and social upliftmentMossel Bay, the historical gateway to the Garden Route, is not just about beaches and maritime history. Mossel Bay is home to Bitcoin Ekasi, a pioneering project that brought Bitcoin to the township of JCC Camp.Bitcoin Ekasi empowers unbanked residents by enabling them to earn and spend Bitcoin locally. Coaches at The Surfer Kids nonprofit are paid in Bitcoin, and local spaza shops accept Bitcoin for daily necessities.For the Bitcoiner tourist, Mossel Bay offers a unique opportunity for “conscious crypto-tourism.” You can take surf lessons from instructors paid in Bitcoin, visit the Bitcoin Ekasi education center, or support the project with direct donations.The town also boasts a Pick n Pay that accepts Bitcoin. As SimplB’s Caw observes: The Bitcoin Ekasi project first started when they began accepting Bitcoin because of the demand from foreign tourists visiting Mossel Bay. It is just so simple to function on a Bitcoin standard once you begin using it.Plettenberg Bay is the fastest-growing Bitcoin economyFurther east, Plettenberg Bay has witnessed an explosion in Bitcoin adoption. In just a few months, the number of Bitcoin-accepting merchants jumped from five to more than 75, making it one of Africa’s most dynamic crypto economies.Confirmed acceptors include Ferris Cars (which facilitates rental accommodation payments in crypto), Glow Lighting Design and all local Pick n Pay branches. Adventure tourism companies, boutique retailers and professional services are increasingly receptive to Bitcoin, especially if you ask. The rapid growth suggests an enthusiastic local scene, with businesses eager to tap into the spending power of Bitcoin tourists.Related: 8 major crypto firms announce US expansion this yearPlettenberg Bay offers a vibrant mix of beach life, nature and crypto-friendly commerce. The town’s energy is palpable, and visitors are encouraged to engage with merchants, share information about Lightning payments, and help grow the ecosystem.“Right now Plettenberg Bay is by far the most interesting circular economy in Africa and possibly the world,” said Jones. “It currently boasts having the most businesses accepting Bitcoin of any town in Africa and has achieved this in less than three months.”Bitcoin preferred signs can be found along the Garden Route. Source: Edwin JonesSedgefield is a quiet pioneerSedgefield, a tranquil town between Knysna and Wilderness, played a key role in the national rollout of Bitcoin payments at Pick n Pay. It was one of the trial sites for the innovative QR code converter from MoneyBadger, which enables Bitcoin spending at every Pick n Pay in South Africa.Sedgefield itself doesn’t have the same density of Bitcoin-accepting independent merchants as Witsand or Plettenberg Bay, but the presence of Pick n Pay ensures that crypto tourists can always pay for groceries and essentials with sats.Practical information for your tripIf you do make it out to the Garden Route, recommended wallets include Blink, Wallet of Satoshi and Phoenix — all Lightning-enabled and widely used in the region. In larger towns like Knysna, George, Wilderness and Oudtshoorn, the Bitcoin scene is still emerging. There aren’t yet established circular economies, but the nationwide acceptance of Bitcoin at Pick n Pay provides a reliable foundation for spending.The Spasie on Breede Restaurant and Bar is just one of many establishments accepting Bitcoin. Source: Edwin JonesBTC Map occasionally lists independent merchants, like Beans About Coffee in Oudtshoorn. Still, the best strategy is to ask around, look for Bitcoin signage, and use mapping tools to discover new acceptors.For accommodation, activities and dining, direct inquiry remains key. Many guesthouses and tour operators are open to Bitcoin payments, especially as awareness grows. Online platforms like Bitrefill enable you to buy gift vouchers for major retailers using Bitcoin, providing a workaround for places that don’t yet accept crypto directly.Happy travels.Magazine: Pranksy: Inside the anonymous life of an NFT legend — NFT Collector",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoiners-guide-south-africa-garden-route?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-17T15:00:00.000Z,"The DeFi mullet — Fintech needs DeFi in the back","Opinion by: Merlin Egalite, co-founder at Morpho LabsFintechs in the front, decentralized finance (DeFi) in the back: the DeFi Mullet.Today’s fintech companies offer excellent user experiences but are constrained by traditional financial infrastructure — siloed, slow, expensive and inflexible. Meanwhile, DeFi provides lightning-fast, cost-effective, interoperable infrastructure but lacks mainstream accessibility.The solution? Combine fintech’s distribution and user experience with DeFi’s efficient back end.The mullet is inevitableFintech companies heavily rely on traditional financial (TradFi) infrastructure that is siloed, slow to deploy and run, and costly to maintain. This inefficiency limits their control over costs and product offerings and has potential infrastructure risks. Fintechs have a strong incentive to transition to building on autonomous, credibly neutral public infrastructure.The power of DeFi is evident in stablecoins. While traditional international wire transfers cost $30–$50 and take one to five business days, stablecoin transfers cost mere cents and settle in seconds. This revolutionary improvement in financial infrastructure extends beyond payments. DeFi provides 24/7/365 infrastructure for trading, lending and borrowing with instant settlement, open access and deep liquidity, enabling better price execution and yields.Plugging their compliance-ready front end into DeFi infrastructure, fintech companies can focus on creating exceptional user experiences. This opens up tremendous opportunities for innovation while driving more liquidity onchain, creating a positive feedback loop of embracing the DeFi Mullet.Now is the time for mainstream adoptionToday’s DeFi ecosystem has proven its reliability for fintech integration. There are dozens of protocols that demonstrate this maturity, securely managing billions in loans through immutable, governance-minimized designs. DeFi infrastructure gives fintechs complete control over their infrastructure. This is particularly crucial after the recent Synapse bankruptcy that trapped Yotta user funds meant to be insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.Recent: Bitcoin DeFi will have 300M users, beating Ethereum and Solana: ExecInstitutions are also coming onchain. BlackRock has tokenized a fund via Securitize; Stripe has acquired Bridge for $1 billion to scale its stablecoin solutions; the US is creating a strategic Bitcoin (BTC) reserve; and clarity on regulation is opening the floodgates. The shift is step-by-step but tangible.DeFi has arrived.The next phaseFor years to come, expect more products like crypto-backed loans to be released by fintech’s most advanced players, offering onchain saving accounts, onchain loans, instant international payments and more. This transformation will be invisible to users and powered by smart wallets and account abstraction that maintain the familiar Web2-like user experience at which fintech companies excel. Early adopters will gain significant advantages over competitors.Yet, unlike building on traditional finance, DeFi’s open infrastructure means even latecomers can benefit from existing network effects without starting from zero.Some skeptics argue that the involvement of fintechs and traditional institutions will erode decentralization, as protocols must comply with regulatory requirements. While this concern is understandable, the opposite is more likely.Expecting protocols to achieve compliance across every jurisdiction worldwide is unrealistic, especially given the vast regulatory fragmentation. Instead, regulating the apps that interface with users makes far more sense rather than the underlying protocols. For this regulatory model to work, however, protocols must remain credibly neutral.A credibly neutral mechanism adheres to four principles:It embeds no preference for specific individuals or outcomes.It is open-source with publicly verifiable execution.It is simple and understandable.It changes infrequently.Examples like HTTP and SMTP demonstrate the power of credibly neutral protocols — they are free, open and unregulated, with only the clients subject to oversight. The same logic should apply to governance-minimized, immutable DeFi protocols.These constraints will push DeFi builders toward creating genuinely decentralized and trustless systems.Fintechs integrating DeFi protocols can build on top of the most neutral infrastructure and access their growing network effects.Let the mullet growThe DeFi mullet is more than just a meme — it’s a structural shift.To scale, DeFi must meet users where they are: through regulated, user-friendly fintech channels. For fintechs to stay relevant, they must offer their customers the best user experience and opportunities, such as the best rates. Those who miss this opportunity risk falling into irrelevance, much like traditional retail banks losing market share to today’s fintechs.This convergence isn’t just possible — it’s inevitable.Opinion by: Merlin Egalite, co-founder at Morpho Labs.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-17T12:09:46.000Z,"Bitcoin to $250K in 2025 ‘totally possible’ — crypto analyst Scott Melker","Bitcoin’s next explosive move could send the asset to $250,000 by the end of 2025, according to Scott Melker, a crypto analyst and host of The Wolf of All Streets podcast.Speaking in a recent interview, Melker cited growing institutional interest and diminishing volatility as key factors that could drive the next leg up.“250K this year, totally possible,” Melker said, adding that Bitcoin (BTC)’s volatility has declined significantly in recent years.“It used to be about three times as volatile as the S&P. Now it’s less than two times.” He pointed to increased involvement from pension funds and ETF issuers as evidence of a more mature, stable market.The shift, he argued, reflects a broader trend of institutional adoption. “The more institutional money, the more Wall Street money, the more long-term holders get involved, the less volatility there’s going to be,” Melker explained.Related: New Bitcoin price all-time highs could occur in MayCrypto markets show signs of strength in 2025Market activity in 2025 has already shown signs of strength. Bitcoin surged past $104,000, while Ether (ETH) reclaimed levels above $2,600.Coinbase’s addition to the S&P 500 marked a major milestone for crypto’s integration into mainstream finance. Melker noted the company is not just entering the index but doing so in the top 50 by market cap — a reflection of how deeply rooted some crypto firms have become.In addition to Coinbase, firms like Galaxy Digital and eToro have moved forward with public listings, signaling confidence in regulatory conditions under the current US administration.Melker said that this environment, bolstered by dropped SEC lawsuits and favorable executive orders, has created what he calls “an extremely bullish” backdrop for the sector.While Bitcoin remains the primary focus, Melker acknowledged a renewed interest in altcoins. Recent price action saw Ethereum outpace Bitcoin, triggering a rally across smaller-cap tokens — a sign, he said, that “new money” is entering the space rather than just rotating within it.Related: Here is why Bitcoin price is stuck below $105KDon’t rule out a wild runDespite the optimism, Melker tempered expectations, noting that most experts are forecasting cycle highs between $120,000 and $150,000. Still, he emphasized that wild surges are not out of the ordinary in crypto.“From the 2020 lows to the last bull market, Bitcoin went from $3,000 to $69,000.

2025-05-17T09:12:28.000Z,"Everstake defends non-custodial staking as SEC weighs industry input","The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has held discussions with Everstake, one of the largest non-custodial staking providers globally, to explore clearer regulatory definitions around staking in blockchain networks.The meeting, which also involved the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, comes at a time when over $193 billion in digital assets are staked across major proof-of-stake (PoS) networks.However, despite the massive scale of participation, staking remains in a legal gray zone in the US as regulators wrestle with its classification under existing securities law.The previous SEC administration also took enforcement actions against major players such as Kraken, Coinbase, and Consensys due to their staking services. The agency, under pro-crypto President Donald Trump, has recently dismissed these enforcement actions.During the meeting, Everstake told the SEC that non-custodial staking should not be classified as a securities transaction. The company said that users maintain full control over their digital assets throughout the staking process and do not transfer ownership to a third party.They argued that this makes staking a technical function, not an investment product.“Our main assertion is that staking is not a financial instrument or security transaction, but rather a technical process, a base-layer protocol mechanism—akin to an oracle in a database—that maintains the integrity and functionality of decentralized networks,” Everstake founder Sergii Vasylchuk told Cointelegraph.Everstake team meeting with the SEC. Source: EverstakeRelated: SEC delays staking decision for Grayscale ETH ETFsEverstake calls for regulatory clarityIn a letter submitted to the SEC’s Crypto Task Force on April 8, 2025, Everstake asked the agency to extend regulatory clarity to non-custodial staking and custodial and liquid staking models.In the letter, which came in respond to Commissioner Hester Peirce’s call for input on regulatory treatment of blockchain services, Everstake argued that non-custodial staking should not be considered a securities offering.It claimed that non-custodial staking, where users retain control of their tokens, does not involve the pooling of assets or the expectation of profits from managerial efforts.In its model, Everstake said users delegate only validation rights while maintaining ownership of their digital assets. The staking rewards are algorithmically distributed by the blockchain network itself, and the firm merely provides technical infrastructure.Related: Ethereum ETF staking will have little impact without multimonth rally: AnalystNon-custodial staking fails the Howey testThe letter also details why non-custodial staking fails each prong of the Howey test. Users do not make an investment of money in a common enterprise, do not expect profits from Everstake’s efforts, and are not dependent on the company’s management for financial returns.Instead, any rewards come from network-level incentives and fluctuate with the market value of the underlying asset.Everstake proposes specific criteria that should exempt non-custodial staking from securities classification. These include user asset control, absence of pooled funds, permissionless unstaking, and the provision of purely technical services.It likens non-custodial staking to proof-of-work mining, which the SEC has previously ruled out as a securities transaction.Margaret Rosenfeld, Everstake’s chief legal officer, also told Cointelegraph that “with non-custodial staking, there’s no handover of assets, no investment contract, and no third-party risk.” She added:“Treating it as a securities offering undermines the decentralized model and risks chilling innovation in the blockchain sector.”Nevertheless, the SEC has so far withheld a definitive stance. Rosenfeld said that the agency did not make any “specific commitments” on staking guidance. However, it continues to listen to industry stakeholders.“The Task Force is actively engaging with a range of stakeholders—including those involved with non-custodial staking, ETFs, and broader blockchain infrastructure—to gather input.”In an April 30 letter to the SEC, nearly 30 crypto advocate groups led by the lobby group the Crypto Council for Innovation (CCI) asked the agency for clear regulatory guidance on crypto staking and staking services.Magazine: Binance Wallet ‘killing’ MetaMask and airdrops, Chinese RWA tokens: Asia Express",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/everstake-defends-non-everstake-sec-non-custodial-staking-guidance-staking-as-sec-weighs-industry-input?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-17T00:57:29.000Z,"Bitcoin bull flag and standard profit taking hint at eventual rally to new BTC price highs","Key takeaways: Traders expect a Bitcoin price pullback to $90,000, but a bull flag could break out to new highs if profit taking near the range highs reduces. On-chain data suggests the current profit taking is too weak to extinguish Bitcoin’s current price momentum. Bitcoin (BTC) price has spent the bulk of the week pinned below $104,000 to $105,000, which many analysts have labelled as a resistance zone, but an alternative view suggests that BTC is simply consolidating within a bull flag. A bull flag is a continuation pattern that is characterized by a period of sideways price action following a sharp uptrend, and when the structure confirms or breaks from the trendline resistance, the uptrend continues. BTC/USDT 1-day chart. Source: TRDR.ioWhile the range-bound trading portion of the flag is said to represent indecision from buyers and sellers, in this scenario, the absence of buy volume is the primary culprit. As shown in the TRDR.io chart below, Bitcoin’s explosive move to $105,900 from $74,400 was accompanied by large liquidations in the margin markets and robust spot volumes, which aligned with several days of billion-dollar spot BTC ETF inflows. BTC/USDT 1hr chart. Source: TRDR.ioDuring this three-week period, several US-based and international companies also announced plans to purchase Bitcoin and establish BTC treasuries. The spot and futures cumulative volume delta, along with the open interest metric on the chart show traders selling near the range highs and the absence of new long leverage and significantly sized spot positions being opened in this area, whereas drops to range low (bull flag support) sees bids filled on the spot side, but there is still limited use of margin for fresh longs. BTC/USD spot and margin CVD. Source: TRDR.ioBitcoin’s recent cool-down phase is a normal outcome after the near 40% recovery that started on April 8, and the loss of upward momentum resulting from profit-taking in futures markets near the current range high is also to be expected. Bitcoin short-term holder supply profit and loss data from Glassnode supports this view, as shown in the chart below. The onchain data company highlighted profit taking for short-term traders but explained that it does not exceed the statistical norm, leaving room for further price upside. “Recently, the magnitude of STH Realized Profit has surged to almost +3 standard deviations above its 90-day average, reflecting a notable uptick in profit realization.
