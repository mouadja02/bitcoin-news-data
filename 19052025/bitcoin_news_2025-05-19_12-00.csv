2025-05-19T09:56:38.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Prediction This Week: Will BTC Break Past $106K or Pull Back?","The post Bitcoin Price Prediction This Week: Will BTC Break Past $106K or Pull Back? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin has hit a tough resistance level after testing the top of its current trading range for the third time. Recently, Bitcoin shocked traders as it shot up to $106K, then quickly tumbled back to $103K , all in a matter of hours. This sudden spike and drop wiped out over $600 million in crypto bets, catching both buyers and sellers by surprise. Bitcoin ( $BTC ) currently trades at $103,168 with a $2.05T market cap, down 0.72% in 24h. Momentum has weakened as both price and market cap declined. 24h volume spiked to $44B—1.5x recent average—suggesting growing volatility.

With inflation worries and economic uncertainty in the air, Bitcoin is still hovering near its highs , but the road ahead looks bumpy. Analyst Breaks Down What’s Next Crypto analyst Mags explains that the $106K level has become a key barrier for Bitcoin’s price , making it hard for the asset to break higher on the first try. This latest rejection came after Bitcoin reclaimed the range, a retest that often doesn’t lead to an immediate breakout. Although Bitcoin was rejected again, Mags believes this setup still supports a bullish outlook. He outlines two possible scenarios that could unfold from here, both of which favor upward movement. #Bitcoin is Dumping – But Why? Is It Over? Yesterday, Bitcoin tested the range high for the third time and got rejected again. This area is proving to be strong resistance. Previously, rejection from this same level led to a breakdown below the range. Now, this is the first… pic.twitter.com/4KhFmiQk3Q — Mags (@thescalpingpro) May 19, 2025 Scenario One: Breakout After Brief Pause The first possible outcome is that Bitcoin consolidates slightly below the resistance before breaking out strongly. Mags says this kind of breakout is rare but very powerful. It usually comes when the market catches off guard and leads to a sudden rise in price. If Bitcoin breaks this resistance after some brief sideways movement, it could signal strong momentum and kick off the next rally. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Arthur Hayes Reveals Bold Crypto Market Prediction 2025 , Scenario Two: Pullback Before Next Leg Up The second possibility is a short-term dip. Bitcoin could move back down toward the middle of the range, which sits around the $99,400 level. Mags says this could include a brief move below that price as part of a healthy correction. Such a retest would give the market time to reset before pushing higher again. This path may take longer, but it helps build stronger support for a more sustainable move up. Outlook Remains Positive Despite the recent rejection, both of these scenarios suggest that Bitcoin still has more room to grow . Mags emphasizes that the current price action is not bearish. Instead, it shows a typical pattern of resistance testing before a larger breakout. Traders are now watching closely to see whether Bitcoin will push higher soon or take a dip before making its next move. Either way, Mags remains optimistic about the trend. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

According to data from CoinGecko, the Ethereum-based version of MOO DENG ( MOODENG ) was up about 15.5%, trading around $0.000050 on May 19, afternoon Asian time. That puts it up nearly 180% from its lowest point this year, and gives it a market cap of roughly $11.39 billion. This recent price jump was backed by strong trading activity. Daily volume surged 130% over the previous day, hitting more than $12 million, a clear sign of renewed market interest. Looking at the 4-hour chart, MOODENG has made a solid recovery since it bottomed at $0.000018 in April. It’s now trading above both its short- and long-term moving averages, which usually signals that buyers are in control. MOODENG price, 50-day and 200-day EMA chart — May 19 | Source: TradingView On top of that, the token recently broke out of a falling wedge pattern , a classic bullish setup. Even more encouraging, a golden cross just formed, with the 20-day EMA crossing over the 50-day EMA. The last time this happened, MOODENG rallied about 140% from the breakout point.

The RSI currently sits at 56, which suggests MOODENG still has room to climb before hitting overbought territory. MOODENG MACD and RSI chart — May 19 | Source: TradingView Based on this setup, MOODENG could continue its rally all the way to $0.000093, which is around 85% higher than the current price. That level also happens to be a major resistance zone, which the token last tested in early February. Momentum on the technical front is also being matched by a rise in daily active addresses, hinting at growing network usage and retail participation. Meanwhile, whales appear to be jumping in, too. Data from Santiment reveals a noticeable increase in addresses holding between 10,000 and 100 million MOODENG tokens, which suggests large holders are accumulating. Source: Santiment The uptick in whale activity and trading volume has coincided with MOODENG trending on Google, further hinting at growing retail curiosity. At press time, MOODENG was exchanging hands at $0.000050 per coin.

Global cryptocurrency sales on darknet markets dropped by 15% in 2024, though Russia ‘s darknet market scene tells a different story with one platform bucking the trend, according to new data from blockchain forensic firm Chainalysis . In a blog post, Chainalysis revealed that while total revenue on darknet markets dropped 15% in 2024 due to years of international law enforcement efforts, crypto sales on a Russia-focused darknet market still jumped 68%. The platform, known as Kraken, has become “the leading darknet market by annual revenue” since the closure of Hydra, Russia’s largest darknet market, in April 2022.

Despite the global downturn, Chainalysis noted that darknet markets still process hundreds of millions of dollars in crypto each year. But law enforcement crackdowns and blockchain transparency have pushed many operators to move away from Bitcoin ( BTC ) due to its inherent transparency.

2025-05-19T09:44:18.000Z,"Bitcoin to $300,000 Isn’t a Matter of How but When, Says Pundit as Price Soars Past $103,000","Bitcoin (BTC) kicked off the month with renewed momentum, breaking above $103,000. At press time, the world’s leading cryptocurrency is trading at approximately $103,241, up just over 3.50% over the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinGecko. Meanwhile, the total crypto market capitalization rose 3.10% over the same period to $3.25 trillion. However, BTC’s dominance currently sits at a commanding 61%, indicating that altcoins have lagged. That said, BTC’s surge has reignited bullish sentiment across the market, with popular trader and market analyst Gert Van Lagen confidently declaring that Bitcoin’s march toward $300,000 is now a question of when, not if . “BTC to ~$300K+ isn’t a question of if, but when. The structure is screaming for it — identical to what we saw in SPX and Gold before their breakouts.” The pundit tweeted . According to Van Lagen, Bitcoin’s current price action mirrors a textbook “cup and handle” pattern, having broken out of both the handle structure and the neckline earlier this year. Notably, Bitcoin’s ascent also coincided with a new all-time high for gold, which surged to $3,389 per troy ounce. The rally in both assets reflects growing investor concern over macroeconomic instability, especially amid escalating tensions between the U.S. and China. This uncertain backdrop has increased demand for alternative stores of value, particularly Bitcoin and gold , as investors hedge against a weakening dollar. “Bitcoin’s breakout above $87,000 is driven by rising global liquidity, fueled by expanding money supply and renewed institutional interest,” explained Dominic John, analyst at Kronos Research. Additionally, data from Glassnode reveals a sharp uptick in accumulation by large holders. Notably, whales holding over 10,000 BTC are maintaining a strong accumulation trend, with an accumulation score near 0.7. Additionally, the number of wallets holding over 1,000 BTC has climbed to a four-month high of 2,107, levels last seen during the Trump election rally in late 2024, while smaller holders appear to be exiting the market. “Whales are accumulating huge amounts of bitcoin. They know what’s coming next,” said crypto trader Mister Crypto. On-chain analytics from Santiment also shows that addresses holding between 10 and 10,000 BTC now control 67.77% of the circulating supply, adding over 53,000 BTC in April alone. That said, as geopolitical tensions rise and institutional accumulation intensifies, the road to $300,000 is beginning to look less speculative and more inevitable.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-to-300000-isnt-a-matter-of-how-but-when-says-pundit-as-price-soars-past-103000/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare
2025-05-19T09:38:26.000Z,"U.S. 30-Year Yield Tops 5% as Moody’s Cuts Credit Rating","The yield on the U.S. 30-year Treasury bond climbed above 5%—reaching 5.011% intraday—for the first time since April, signaling deepening concerns over America’s fiscal health. Moody’s recent downgrade of the U.S. credit rating removed its Aaa status, citing large deficits and rising interest costs. The last time this part of the yield curve reached such a level was on April 9, during the \""tariff tantrum\""—a period marked by aggressive market sell-offs across stocks and cryptocurrencies. Back then, Bitcoin had dropped to a local low near $75,000 , but it has since rallied to around $103,000 after peaking at $106,000 over the weekend. Market expert Jim Bianco pointed out that the last time the 30-year yield closed at or above 5% was on October 31, 2023. That was just shy of the highest recent close—5.11% on October 19, a level not seen since 2007. Adding to the pressure, foreign appetite for U.S. debt is fading. The U.K. has now overtaken China as the second-largest foreign holder of Treasuries , with $779.3 billion, behind only Japan. Both China and Japan have been steadily reducing their holdings, increasing the urgency for the U.S. to find alternative debt buyers. As more bonds are issued to cover budget shortfalls, the increase in supply is pushing yields up and prices down. Meanwhile, the broader markets are reacting nervously— Nasdaq futures dropped around 2% , reflecting a growing shift toward risk aversion.",coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/u-s-30-year-yield-tops-5-as-moody-s-cuts-credit-rating,"ASIA|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION","",cryptocompare
2025-05-19T09:34:45.000Z,"Altcoins Bleed Out as Bitcoin (BTC) Faced Violent Rejection at $107K (Market Watch)","Bitcoin’s price initiated a sharp upward move on Sunday evening only to have a violent rejection that pushed it south by almost five grand in hours. Many altcoins have followed suit on the way down, with substantial losses from the likes of SOL, ADA, AVAX, SHIB, and others. BTC Stopped at $106K Last Monday was also quite eventful for BTC, whose price went up to almost $106,000 for the first time since late January before it crashed to under $101,000 within hours. However, the bulls managed to maintain the asset within a six-digit price territory and began a recovery that pushed the cryptocurrency back to a tight range between $103,000 and $105,000. It spent most of the business week between those two boundaries, and the weekend began on a dull note , as most do. However, the landscape changed on Sunday evening when the bulls initiated a surprising rally that drove BTC to $106,000 at first, where it was stopped, but another, even more impressive run pushed it beyond $107,000 to mark a new multi-month peak. Another rejection followed, and BTC slumped by roughly $5,000 within hours to just over $102,000. It has recovered some ground since then and now sits above $103,000, and its market cap is back to $2.050 trillion. Its dominance over the alts has surged to almost 61% on CG after falling below 59.5% last week. BTCUSD.

Bitcoin commanded a market cap of $2.038 trillion at press time, edging out Alphabet’s $2.02 trillion. At the top of the global asset rankings, gold remains the leader with a market cap of $21.70 trillion, followed by technology giants Microsoft ($3.37 trillion), Nvidia ($3.30 trillion), Apple ($3.155 trillion), and Amazon ($2.182 trillion).

Bitcoin one-day market cap chart. Source: CoinMarketCap Drivers of Bitcoin’s price rally Although there was no immediate trigger for the Bitcoin rally that nearly tested $107,000, several factors may have driven the price higher. For instance, investors seem to be tapping into the asset as a potential safe haven in reaction to Moody’s downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating, alongside easing trade tensions. At the same time, Bitcoin has also seen increased capital inflows into exchange-traded funds. Data shows that U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded net inflows of $608 million over the past week. On the other hand, Google also had an impressive week, with the stock rallying over 5% to close at $167.43 in the last trading session. GOOGL one-week price chart. Source: Finbold Bitcoin and Google structural differences The two assets, however, operate in different categories. Alphabet, a technology giant, is backed by tangible company assets, including its vast portfolio of services like Google Search, YouTube, and cloud computing. In contrast, Bitcoin is a decentralized currency that exists solely in the digital realm and trades 24/7 on global exchanges. This structural difference may have given Bitcoin an edge, as its surge past Alphabet occurred over the weekend, when traditional stock markets were closed. Bitcoin’s ability to trade around the clock allowed it to capitalize on weekend market momentum, while Alphabet’s stock remained static until markets reopened on Monday. However, given the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies , Bitcoin’s lead over Google may be short-lived, as digital assets entered Monday facing notable capital outflows.

2025-05-19T09:21:15.000Z,"Best Crypto To Buy For Quick Gains as BNB, ETH, and SOL Pegged to Bitcoin’s $100K+ Push","Bitcoin Pepe is capturing major attention as the best crypto to buy now, while the crypto market gears up for Bitcoin’s long-anticipated break above $100,000. While heavyweights like BNB, ETH, and SOL are expected to ride the wave of Bitcoin’s momentum, Bitcoin Pepe offers something even more explosive—early-stage growth potential paired with real infrastructure. As Bitcoin's first meme-focused layer 2, it blends BTC’s unmatched security with the viral energy of meme culture. Bitcoin Pepe’s PEP-20 token standard unlocks token creation directly on Bitcoin, a game-changer for meme coin adoption. With presale funding surging past $9m, rumors of CEX listing spreading, and listing set for May 31, Bitcoin Pepe stands out as one of the best cryptos to buy now for rapid gains. Why BNB is still a strong bet for 2025 Binance Coin (BNB) might not deliver the explosive returns seen in other tokens, but analysts are not counting it out. Standard Chartered has projected a potential rise to $1,275 by 2025, driven by upcoming ETF developments and the growing integration of artificial intelligence within the Binance ecosystem. Source Currently hovering around $650, BNB’s slower momentum than its peers is mainly due to its more centralized framework and measured growth pace. Still, with deep-rooted infrastructure, AI-powered upgrades, and mounting institutional interest, BNB’s breakout could be a matter of patience, not possibility. For long-term investors, the runway is still intact. Ethereum’s trillion-dollar security initiative reinforces bullish momentum Ethereum is doubling down on security at a pivotal moment. On May 14, the Ethereum Foundation on X announced the launch of its ambitious Trillion Dollar Security Initiative to protect critical areas such as wallets, smart contracts, infrastructure, and user interfaces. 0.

Source Analysts now view the $2,000–$2,300 range as crucial support. If this level holds, Ethereum could be on track to break past $3,000, strengthening its grip as the top programmable blockchain while boosting confidence among long-term investors. Bitcoin Pepe tipped as top altcoin as May 31 listing nears Bitcoin Pepe is quickly positioning itself as one of the most promising altcoins of 2025. Built as the first meme-centric layer 2 protocol on Bitcoin, it brings together the reliability of Bitcoin’s security with Solana-style speed and scalability.

The $170–$185 range has become a critical zone, with traders debating whether the current price action signals bullish consolidation or looming exhaustion. Crypto analyst Ali (@ali_charts) has flagged a developing cup-and-handle pattern, suggesting that a confirmed breakout above $200 could trigger a fresh wave of buying. While overbought signals remain a concern, the broader altcoin rally led by Bitcoin and Ethereum supports bullish sentiment.

2025-05-19T09:16:28.000Z,"Top 5 Crypto Events to Watch Today – May 19th","The post Top 5 Crypto Events to Watch Today – May 19th appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News May 19th is turning out to be nothing like a regular (boring) Monday – everything seems to be hitting at once! This is a day packed with real-world moves that could either disrupt or immensely boost the crypto market. From high-stakes calls from the White House to a Senate vote that reshape how stablecoins are regulated in the U.S., there’s a lot happening. Let’s break it down – what’s happening, why it matters, and what to watch next. #1 Trump, Putin, and a Ceasefire Bid that Could Quiet the Chaos President Donald Trump will speak separately with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky today in a push to secure a ceasefire. “I will be speaking, by telephone, to President Vladimir Putin of Russia on Monday, at 10:00 a.m.,” Trump said on Truth Social, aiming to stop the “bloodbath” killing over 5,000 troops a week and to discuss trade. He also confirmed he’ll follow up with Zelensky and NATO members. The geopolitical backdrop is heavy – but here’s where crypto enters the picture: research shows the Russia-Ukraine war directly affects Bitcoin trading volumes. A 1% escalation in the war reportedly causes a 0.2% drop in BTC activity. So, if this ceasefire progresses, don’t be surprised to see a volume bounce and a broader market reset. #2 XRP Futures Go Live on CME – Eyes on $2.50? After months of speculation, it’s official – CME is launching XRP futures today! The move works to expand its crypto derivatives lineup and clear the way for new institutional strategies. “We’re pleased to announce our plans to expand our suite of cryptocurrency derivatives with the introduction of XRP futures on May 19, subject to regulatory review,” CME said. If it wasn’t clear – this is a big deal! Not just because CME is the world’s largest derivatives exchange, but because futures products often act as a gateway for hedge funds and tradfi institutions that can’t (or won’t) hold spot crypto. And let’s take a look back. When CME launched regulated Bitcoin futures in late 2017, it famously coincided with the top of that bull cycle. So the XRP crowd is watching closely: could this be a breakout moment? For now, signals lean bullish. Technical indicators suggest XRP could push toward $2.50, and the token is holding firm above key moving averages. Plus, there’s growing noise around institutional interest, with BlackRock’s crypto strategies and the XRP ETF launch both in the mix. #3 Coinbase Hits the S&P 500 – A Historic First for Crypto Coinbase Global (COIN) officially enters the S&P 500 today, replacing Discover Financial Services. What a milestone! “Coinbase Global Inc. (NASD: COIN) will replace Discover Financial Services (NYSE: DFS) in the S&P 500 effective prior to the opening of trading on Monday, May 19,” said S&P Global in a release. Founded in 2012, Coinbase has grown into the largest U.S.-based crypto exchange and the world’s biggest Bitcoin custodian. As of today, the company holds a market cap of $67.87 billion. For crypto, this moment is symbolic and strategic. It’s one thing to talk about adoption – it’s another to see one of the biggest names in the space sit shoulder to shoulder with Apple, Amazon, and JPMorgan on one of Wall Street’s most elite lists. Wouldn’t you agree? #4 Saylor May Be Back to Buy More Bitcoin Michael Saylor is teasing YET another big Bitcoin purchase for Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy). In a familiar move, he posted the firm’s portfolio tracker on X, a signal that’s historically preceded a BTC buy within 24 hours. “Never short a man who buys orange ink by the barrel,” he wrote. Strategy currently holds 568,840 BTC worth $59 billion, up $19.7 billion from cost basis. If this next buy lands, Bitcoin bulls may just get the fuel they need to push toward $110K. Fingers crossed. #5 Stablecoin Vote: GENIUS Act Returns to Senate Floor The GENIUS Act – a bipartisan bill aiming to establish a federal framework for payment stablecoins – is back for another vote after falling short earlier this month. Senator Bill Hagerty said, “Next week, the Senate will make history when we pass the GENIUS Act…” adding that the bill would “cement U.S. dollar dominance, protect customers, increase demand for U.S. treasuries…” Senator Gillibrand echoed the urgency, stressing stablecoins’ role in global finance. If this passes, it’ll mark the U.S.’s first serious regulatory win in crypto – and finally offer some clarity to stablecoin players. Bottom line? May 19 is stacked with events that could set the tone for the next phase of the crypto cycle. Momentum is building.

2025-05-19T09:15:52.000Z,"Billionaire Steve Cohen Issues Recession Warning, Expects Fed To Keep Rates Steady Amid ‘Significant Slowing Growth’: Report","Billionaire and hedge fund legend Steve Cohen reportedly believes that the US economy is not yet over the hump despite positive developments over the last few weeks. At the Sohn Investment Conference in New York, the head of Point72 Asset Management says there’s a 45% chance that the US will enter a period of economic contraction, reports Bloomberg. “We aren’t in a recession yet, but we have significant slowing growth.” Cohen predicts that the US economy will grow by 1.5% in 2026, noting that the figure is “OK but not phenomenal.” Data from Trading Economics shows that the US GDP has grown 3.2% on average from 1947 until 2025. Turning to the S&P 500, Cohen notes that the stock market’s abrupt reversal after falling to a low of 4,835 points in April is “unusual,” comparing the move to the rallies witnessed after the March 2020 Covid-induced collapse. For now, the billionaire says it is within the realm of possibility for the S&P 500 to retrace by as much as 15% or just move sideways in the coming months. “Markets don’t have to go up every year. Markets can go sideways and that’s perfectly normal.” As for the Federal Reserve, Cohen thinks that Chair Jerome Powell will keep interest rates steady to cushion the economy against tariff-induced shocks. “They are going to be worried about inflation from tariffs.” Cohen is not the only one to sound the alarm about the possibility of the US entering an economic recession. Last week, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said that a US economic downturn is something he wouldn’t take off the table at this point, even after the White House signed a trade truce with China last week.

BTC price action grabs liquidity before reversing to its starting position, liquidating many an emotional trader on the way. A fakeout or a taste of things to come? The May 18 daily and weekly close nonetheless became Bitcoin’s highest ever. US trade deals remain high on the list of macro volatility triggers for risk asset traders this week. Crypto’s correlation with stocks paints a mixed picture, adding to uncertainty over how macro developments will influence Bitcoin and altcoins going forward. Bitcoin exchange volume delta becomes a key ingredient in assessing the staying power of BTC price breakouts, per analysis from CryptoQuant. A liquidity grab for the ages Bitcoin price action delivered some “classic” moves around the May 18 weekly close. A trip to new multimonth highs near $107,000 was followed by a 4% correction in a matter of hours, data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows. BTC/USD 1-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The spike took out a block of liquidity nestled close to all-time highs, with BTC/USD performing a liquidity “grab” designed to first squeeze out shorts and then trap late longs. “Classic liquidity trap above the recent high and reversal downwards,” crypto trader, analyst and entrepreneur Michaël van de Poppe responded on X. “I think we'll do the same at $100K before we'll start breaking out above the ATHs. Those are the zones to accumulate your Bitcoin.” BTC/USDT 4-hour chart with RSI data.

Source: CoinGlass Discussing the outlook for Bitcoin, trader CrypNuevo was among those arguing for caution instead of entering at any level in the current range above $100,000. “From a risk management perspective, I don’t see it worth it to go long right now at market price,” he wrote in an X thread prior to the weekly close volatility. “Yes, price could go up as the HTF trend suggests but as a trader I look for low risk entries. We're currently at resistance. Clearing it would make a much more attractive entry.” BTC/USDT 1-week chart with 50EMA.

Source: CoinGlass US trade war rumbles on as Bitcoin ignores rate-cut odds A lack of crucial macroeconomic data reports this week places the focus on the Federal Reserve and US trade deals. In particular, markets will be looking for positive developments regarding trade ties between the US and its partners. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent promised to enact new tariffs on those who do not negotiate in “good faith.” News of a deal with China caused a snap reaction for stocks earlier this month, with traders feeling a sense of relief. This may not be so evident as the week begins, thanks to the recent US credit downgrade by Moody’s, wiping 1% off stocks’ futures prior to the first Wall Street open. With the dollar again under pressure, trading resource The Kobeissi Letter suggested that Bitcoin and altcoins may still benefit in the current climate. “Crypto is loving the Moody’s downgrade: Bitcoin is now 4% away from a new all time high and up over +40% since its April low,” it noted around the weekly close. “As the US Dollar weakens and uncertainty rises, Bitcoin and Gold are thriving. Instability is Bitcoin’s best friend.” US dollar Index (DXY) 1-day chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView Crypto is also increasingly resilient to hawkish cues from the Fed, which has given markets reason to believe that interest rate cuts will not come before September. Data from CME Group’s FedWatch Tool shows the odds of a cut at the Fed’s upcoming June meeting at just 12%. Jobless claims on May 22 could shift those expectations if the result differs significantly from predictions. Fed target rate probabilities (screenshot).

Crypto stocks correlation in flux Diverging reactions to the Moody’s downgrade set the stage for a debate around crypto’s correlation with US stocks. In its latest analysis, research firm Santiment could not draw a clear conclusion over the two asset classes’ relationship, calling them “somewhat correlated.” “With the 90-day tariff pause between the US & China Monday, markets remain within striking distance of all-time highs,” it summarized on May 17, referring to the S&P 500, Bitcoin and gold.

Bitcoin, S&P 500, 30-day rolling correlation, 1-year chart. Source: Redstone Oracles Meanwhile, market participants have aired frustration at crypto’s susceptibility to the same volatility triggers impacting stocks. “It was a lot more enjoyable when $BTC traded independently of stocks,” commentator IncomeSharks told X followers on May 19. “It seems now it's just a way for people to trade stock futures during the weekend and mirror what the $SPY is doing during the week.” Volume delta warns over “local market top” Considering what it might take to launch Bitcoin back into price discovery, a new analysis looked at exchange order-book behavior. Related: Bitcoin hitting $220K ‘reasonable’ in 2025, says gold-based forecast Binance, in particular, was under the microscope as the exchange with the largest spot volumes. Volume delta, onchain analytics platform CryptoQuant said, is a key ingredient in sustained price moves. “After the recent market correction, the spot net volume delta on Binance has turned positive again,” contributor Darkfost wrote in a “ Quicktake ” blog post on May 18. “This signals that buying activity is picking up on spot markets, but more importantly, that selling pressure has significantly declined, even with BTC trading above $100 000. However, historically, when spot volumes on Binance rise too quickly and too sharply, it has often coincided with local market tops.” Bitcoin spot net volume delta. Source: CryptoQuant Volume delta measures the difference in buy and sell pressure across candles, helping assess the underlying strength of bid and ask sides. CryptoQuant suggests that investors throwing caution to the wind around breakouts contributes to unsustainable price spikes, and monitoring volume delta helps avoid disadvantageous market entries. “Rather than being a warning sign, rising spot volumes at this point would be encouraging for market strength,” Darkfost continued. “Tracking spot volumes can provide valuable insights into investor behavior, especially on Binance, which handles the largest share of global trading.” This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-19T09:04:33.000Z,"Retired Artist Loses Millions in Crypto After Fake Coinbase Call","The scam exploited a fake website and a very convincing story to trick Suman into revealing his hardware wallet’s seed phrase. Additionally, Coinbase is grappling with a major data breach that allegedly involved bribed customer service agents in India. The breach compromised sensitive user data, including that of Sequoia Capital partner Roelof Botha. This raised serious alarms about the potential compromise of other partners at Sequoia Capital, which is one of the world’s most influential venture firms. The attackers reportedly demanded $20 million in hush money. In France, authorities are responding to the spike in crypto-related kidnappings by offering enhanced police protection to crypto executives. The incidents are part of the escalating physical and digital threats targeting crypto holders around the globe. Scammers Pose as Coinbase Staff Retired artist Ed Suman, 67, reportedly lost more than $2 million in cryptocurrency after falling victim to a sophisticated scam that involved imposters claiming to be Coinbase support staff. A Bloomberg report published on May 17 revealed that Suman turned to crypto investing after retiring from a decades-long career in the art world. With a portfolio that included 17.5 Bitcoin (BTC) and 225 Ethereum (ETH), Suman stored his assets securely in a Trezor Model One hardware wallet, which is considered one of the safest options for safeguarding digital currencies offline. However, the security of that setup was upended in March when Suman received a text message warning him of alleged unauthorized access to his Coinbase account. Trezor Model One What followed was a very carefully orchestrated social engineering attack . A man who introduced himself as Brett Miller from Coinbase’s security team called Suman shortly after the message and had an uncanny familiarity with Suman’s setup, including the fact that his crypto was stored on a hardware wallet. The caller appeared highly credible, and convinced Suman that despite the wallet's offline nature, his funds could still be at risk. He then guided Suman through a so-called “security procedure” that required entering his wallet’s seed phrase into a spoofed website that is designed to imitate Coinbase. Just over a week later, another person claiming to be from Coinbase contacted Suman and repeated the security walkthrough. By the time the call ended, Suman’s life savings in crypto were completely drained. The incident has coincided with news of a major data breach at Coinbase. The breach was reportedly carried out by bribing customer service agents in India, and resulted in hackers accessing sensitive user information including names, account balances, and transaction histories. Coinbase Data Breach Hit Top VC The recent data breach at Coinbase reportedly impacted one of the most well known figures in venture capital, which raised new concerns about the depth and seriousness of the incident. According to a May 16 report by Bloomberg, Sequoia Capital Managing Partner Roelof Botha had personal data compromised after the cybercriminals got unauthorized access to Coinbase user information. (Source: Sequoia Capital ) Although Botha has not publicly revealed his net worth, estimates suggest he controls hundreds of millions of dollars in assets. The breach not only affected him but raised serious alarms about the potential compromise of other partners at Sequoia Capital, which is one of the world’s most influential venture firms with deep investments in the tech and crypto sectors. The attackers reportedly tried to extort Coinbase for $20 million in exchange for withholding the data breach from the public, an offer the company declined. Coinbase addressed the incident in a May 15 blog post , and confirmed that a subset of users fell victim to social engineering attacks after their personal account details were accessed. The company stated that the breach stemmed from customer service contractors based in India who were subsequently fired. In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Coinbase estimated it may have to spend between $180 million and $400 million on reimbursement and remediation for the affected users. The situation may also extend beyond Coinbase. Another Bloomberg report indicated that similar social engineering attacks were attempted against users on other major platforms, including Kraken and Binance. In the midst of the data breach, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong was in Washington, DC, pushing for crypto legislation that is currently under review in Congress. There is a Senate vote on a stablecoin bill expected soon and the House is evaluating a new digital asset market structure framework. Coinbase stock price over the past 24 hours (Source: Google ) Meanwhile, Coinbase’s stock fell over 7% after the breach was reported, though it has since rebounded. France Acts After Crypto-Related Kidnappings Coinbase users are not the only people in the crypto industry who are being specifically targeted by criminals. France is taking urgent steps to improve the safety of crypto entrepreneurs and their families after a surge in kidnapping attempts linked to the crypto sector. A May 16 report from Politico revealed that France’s Interior Minister, Bruno Retailleau, announced a suite of enhanced protective measures in response to the growing threat. These include priority access to police emergency lines, specialized home security evaluations, and direct safety briefings from law enforcement officials that are aimed at helping crypto professionals adopt stronger personal protection strategies. These changes were made after three alarming incidents over the past few months. Most recently, on May 13, attackers tried to abduct the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizat, the CEO of French crypto platform Paymium. The attack took place in broad daylight, and local authorities reported that Noizat’s daughter heroically disarmed one of the attackers by seizing and discarding a weapon before managing to escape. Just ten days earlier, on May 3, police in Paris rescued the father of a crypto entrepreneur who was kidnapped and held for ransom in a €7 million ($7.8 million) extortion scheme. And in January, David Balland, co-founder of crypto hardware wallet company Ledger, was abducted from his home in central France. He was held overnight before being freed the next evening. Retailleau believes these cases may be interconnected and pledged to respond with both immediate and long-term countermeasures. This includes specialized training for law enforcement in combating crypto asset laundering, as well as engagement with the crypto industry to build tailored security protocols. Since 2014, there have been more than 150 reported cases of crypto-related robberies or kidnappings globally, with at least 23 occurring in 2025 alone. This is according to a database that is kept up to date by Bitcoin advocate Jameson Lopp . Many of these incidents are believed to stem from criminals tracking victims via public events, social media, or overt displays of wealth. Lopp warned against peer-to-peer trades with unknown individuals, showing off crypto wealth online, and wearing crypto-branded merchandise that might draw attention.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9164/retired-artist-loses-millions-in-crypto-after-fake-coinbase-call,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|WALLET","News|Security",cryptocompare
2025-05-19T09:00:25.000Z,"Solana and XRP Are Exploding — But MAGACOIN FINANCE, Paired With Bitcoin, Is the One Breaking Out","The crypto market is in high gear this May, with high-net-worth traders zoning in on high-conviction plays showing long-term promise and short-term momentum. Bitcoin (BTC) is holding strong near $103,800 as institutional inflows pick up pace. Solana (SOL) has surged 82% from its April low, while XRP just tapped a new 10-week high on confirmation of Ripple’s upcoming stablecoin launch. But the real story? A lesser-known altcoin is pulling attention from the 1% crypto elite — MAGACOIN FINANCE . This early-stage token is gaining traction at an accelerated pace, with analysts flagging it as one of the most aggressive plays of the current cycle. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Gaining Ground in Crypto Circles Within 48 hours of launch, MAGACOIN FINANCE began trending across analyst chats, retail forums, and private Telegram groups.

Solana Jumps 82% — Visa & Meme Coin Fuel Combined Rally Solana (SOL) is currently at $170.90 , up 82% from April lows.

TVL across Solana-based protocols has jumped over 25% in May alone — drawing whales back into the mix. XRP Hits $2.38 as Stablecoin Plans Drive New Momentum XRP has jumped to $2.38 , hitting its highest level in over two months. Ripple confirmed a Q3 rollout of its own stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar — a major move that could reset XRP’s role in institutional settlements. Volume is up over 47% week-over-week, signaling strong buy-side pressure. Injective Rallies to $12.40 on AI Trading Integration Injective (INJ) is trading at $12.40 , up 14% over the past 72 hours. The surge follows the official launch of INJ’s AI-enhanced trading interface — now supported by several algorithmic hedge funds in Asia.

2025-05-19T09:00:02.000Z,"Luxury Seized: Bitcoin From Exchange Hack Triggers Aussie Mansion Bust","An Australian man from Queensland has lost nearly 25 Bitcoin, a waterfront mansion and a Mercedes‑Benz after federal police said the assets may be tied to crime. Based on reports from May 18, the Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce moved in to seize the coins and property worth 4.5 million Australian dollars, about $2.88 million US dollars. He faces no new criminal charges over the Bitcoin, but a court order cleared the way for civil forfeiture. Evidence From Luxembourg Points Police North According to the AFP, the inquiry began in September 2018. That’s when authorities in Luxembourg flagged odd Bitcoin transfers. Investigators traced those movements back to the Queensland man – Shane Stephen Duffy – who pleaded guilty in 2016 for selling League of Legends player data. It wasn’t a direct hacking charge from the 2011 Riot Games breach. Rather, he bought a copy of personal data online and sold it on. Police also believe he’s tied to 950 Bitcoin stolen in 2013 from a French crypto exchange. Civil Powers Used To Seize Bitcoin, Assets Based on reports, the AFP tapped special powers under the Proceeds of Crime Act. They can “restrain and forfeit” assets if they can’t be shown to come from honest work. That means no jail time is needed before the agency moves in. Critics worry this lets authorities take property without a full criminal trial. Supporters say it stops funds being used for more crime and puts money back into community projects. Money To Go Toward Crime Prevention According to the AFP statement, proceeds from the sale of the Bitcoin , house and car will feed a special fund. That fund underwrites crime‑prevention programs and law enforcement efforts. Since July 2019, the taskforce has frozen over $1.2 billion in assets. That list includes homes, yachts, fine art and other crypto holdings. The idea is to turn criminal gains into community benefit. Record Tracks Raise Questions Over Privacy Investigators lean on public blockchain data to trace coins. But anyone holding Bitcoin mixed with “tainted” funds may face a fight to prove their innocence. Tracking each transaction or UTXO can be a heavy lift for everyday users. Some fear this trend could sweep up bystanders who unknowingly hold coins once linked to illicit deals. Community Reaction Mixes Relief And Concern Local reports show mixed feelings. Some residents feel safer knowing high‑value criminal gains can’t slip through the cracks. Others worry about the rights of innocents and the burden of proof. They ask whether civil courts can match the strict standards of criminal trials. As crypto grows more popular, cases like this will test how far authorities can go to reclaim suspect wealth.

Meanwhile, the bears have intensified their action, which has dragged the levels below the previous day’s open range, raising huge concerns over the upcoming price action. On the other hand, BTC’s liquidity range has entered a crucial phase wherein a strong conflict between the bulls and the bears could be seen as a means of gaining supremacy in the coming days. Ever since the BTC price triggered a rebound from the local lows, the whales and the bulls seem to have become more optimistic. As a result, more long traders were being placed with massive leverage. This made the retail traders bullish on Bitcoin, offering a strong boost to the BTC price rally, which almost marked the highs. Frightfully, these whales have begun to extract profit, which seems to be a major reason behind the current downfall. As suggested by the above data, a Hyperliquid whale who had placed a 40x long trade on Bitcoin has begun to take profits after earning $10 million in 24 hours. Interestingly, the whale still holds a massive $337 million long position on BTC, which shows a serious conviction. Now the question arises whether the Bitcoin bull run has more room or it’s time for the exit door. The daily chart of Bitcoin continues to remain under bullish influence, despite the bearish interference. The price just faced a rejection before entering the final resistance zone below the ATH, which suggests a final correction before marking a new high. The On-Balance Volume has been plunging, which indicates a drop in the buying activity with an increase in the sell-offs. However, the MA levels keep up some hope as the BTC price could be heading towards a Golden Cross. The 50/200-day MA is heading for a bullish crossover, which usually triggers a massive upswing. Hence, the upcoming monthly close could have a major impact on the upcoming rally, as a successful completion of a Golden Cross could propel the BTC price above $110,000. In case of a failure, the star crypto may begin with a strong pullback, extending the correction phase.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-juggling-between-pivotal-levels-heres-whats-next-for-the-btc-price-rally-if-it-plunges-below-102k/,"BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|ZRX|TOKEN SALE","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-05-19T08:48:00.000Z,"Coinbase sued in Illinois over biometric data practices tied to KYC checks","Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase is facing a class-action lawsuit in the U.S. state of Illinois, which claims that the company may have violated the state’s Biometric Information Privacy Act. A group of Coinbase customers has accused the platform of improperly collecting and storing facial data during its identity verification process. Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on May 13, the lawsuit alleges that Coinbase’s Know Your Customer checks involve scanning users’ facial geometry without proper notice or consent, a move the plaintiffs say directly breaches Illinois’ biometric privacy laws. According to the complaint, users were required to upload a government-issued ID and a selfie, which were then processed by third-party facial recognition software. The group claims this process captured their biometric identifiers, such as faceprints, without prior written notice or notification of the collection without a publicly available “retention schedule or guidelines” for data destruction, as required under BIPA. “ At no point during the Verification Process are Coinbase users asked to consent to the collection of their biometric information, notified that their biometric data will be collected by an unrelated third party, nor provided with any information about the process, how it works, the type of information and data collected, whether said data is stored or disclosed to other entities, or any information about the retention or destruction of their biometric information.” Bernstein v. Coinbase Global, Inc. According to the complaint, Coinbase transmitted facial data to third-party vendors, including Jumio, Onfido, Au10tix, and Solaris, without obtaining explicit permission. You might also like: Coinbase impersonators steal over $2m in BTC and ETH from retired artist Further, it claims that more than 10,000 individuals have filed for arbitration over these issues, but Coinbase has allegedly failed to pay the necessary arbitration fees, resulting in many of those cases being dismissed. That being said, the group is pushing for financial penalties of up to $5,000 per reckless violation, or $1,000 where negligence is found, in addition to legal expenses and injunctive relief. Coinbase has not publicly commented on the lawsuit at the time of writing. Interestingly, this isn’t the first time Coinbase has been in hot water over alleged BIPA violations in Illinois. As previously reported by crypto.news, a class-action lawsuit filed by a local in May 2023 targeted the exchange over its collection of facial data and fingerprint templates through its mobile app. That case was eventually paused after a judge approved Coinbase’s motion to move the dispute into arbitration. The lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice in February this year, after both parties agreed to drop the case. Making matters worse, Coinbase has also come under fire over a recent data breach involving customer support agents allegedly bribed to leak user data. At least six related lawsuits have since been filed, intensifying scrutiny over the platform’s handling of sensitive information. In other news, Illinois recently dropped a separate lawsuit against Coinbase over its staking program, following similar moves by Kentucky , Vermont, and South Carolina after the SEC dismissed its own case.

In a May 18 X post , the Bybit China Team said it received reports about users experiencing withdrawal restrictions on the Bybit platform due to a KYC verification anomaly when logging in with an Apple ID. The team claimed to have immediately responded and taken action involving multiple departments, including the firm’s chief operating officer, Helen Liu. Other people involved in the operation were the heads of customer service, risk control, the Chinese-language division, product managers and the technical team. The exchange coordinated its actions with the user. After an internal investigation, Bybit concluded this was a “unique case affecting an individual user, not a systemic issue.” The account’s KYC information was not tampered with and the funds in the account remained secure at all times. Bybit had not answered Cointelegraph’s request for comment at the time of writing. Related: A decade-old debate is back as self-custody gets smarter The perks of media attention Bybit claims to have taken large-scale and timely action, which involved a member of its executive team, all in response to an issue reported by a single user. Chinese-speaking X crypto influencer EnHeng claimed to be the reason for this. In a separate post that Bybit’s X post answers to — EnHeng explained that in a group chat, he noticed “a girl mentioned a bug related to Bybit’s Apple ID.” He verified the issue and after confirming that it was real, flagged it to Bybit. EnHeng said that the staff responded quickly and assisted the user in recovering access to about $100,000 worth of funds. They highlighted: “This incident really made me feel the value of having influence.” EnHeng said “in this market, retail investors often lack a voice and are vulnerable.” For this reason, he said, “When we have more resources and a bigger voice, we should use them to speak up for retail investors.” Related: Self-custody vs. centralized crypto cards: Freedom or convenience? Locked out of exchange Being locked out of a cryptocurrency exchange account or some of its features is not excessively uncommon. Often, it is an emergency measure meant to prevent fund losses. A recent example is Phemex crypto exchange halting withdrawals after being alerted to nearly $30 million worth of suspicious outflows that raised alarms among blockchain security firms in late January. Indian cryptocurrency exchange Mudrex temporarily halted crypto withdrawals during the same month, claiming compliance improvements were the reason. Sometimes action is taken on the request of law enforcement. Last summer, a small set of Palestinian user accounts was frozen after Israeli authorities issued a seizure request. Also last summer, OKX warned it would terminate any account linked to crypto mixer Tornado Cash or sanctioned addresses, and several users said their log-ins were suddenly disabled. Those incidents echo an old adage popular in the Bitcoin (BTC) community: Not your keys, not your coins. This statement is meant to remind Bitcoin — and now crypto — users that real control over assets comes only with control over the private keys that allow for signing transactions.

He says every crisis keeps getting bigger because the core issue, fiat money, was never fixed after 1971, when the US left the gold standard. In 1998 Wall Street got together and bailed out a hedge fund LTCM: Long Term Capital Management. In 2008 the Cental Banks got together to bail out Wall Street. In 2025, long time friend, Jim Rickards is asking who is going to bail out the Central Banks? In other words each… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) May 18, 2025 Major Financial Collapse Ahead Kiyosaki pointed to the bailout of hedge fund LTCM by Wall Street in 1998, then the rescue of Wall Street by central banks during the 2008 financial crisis. Now in 2025, he highlights a more pressing concern raised by his long-time friend Jim Rickards. With central banks under pressure, the question is no longer who they will save, but who will save them. Kiyosaki warns that the next domino to fall could be the $1.6 trillion in student loan debt, which Rickards believes could spark a financial breakdown of historic proportions. The veteran investor says this goes well with his long-standing belief that traditional fiat currencies are fundamentally broken. Once again echoing his famous quote, “Savers are losers”, Kiyosaki urges individuals to stop relying on governments or central banks for security. Q: Why will gold, silver, and Bitcoin continue to grow in value? A: The Marxist Central Bank system is crashing…. Many going bankrupt. Keep HODLing. I am and buying more Bitcoin. I predict Bitcoin climbs to $250 k this year. Buy more. Do not sell. — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) May 17, 2025 Kiyosaki says the way to protect your wealth and freedom is by rejecting government money and choosing assets like Bitcoin, gold, and silver. He believes these real assets help people avoid losing control to a system he sees as heading toward socialism through economic manipulation. Kiyosaki likened the current system to Marxist-style control, warning that fake data and corrupt leadership hurt the economy and take away people’s wealth and freedom. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Arthur Hayes Reveals Bold Crypto Market Prediction 2025 , What does it mean for you? Overall, Kiyosaki’s message shows the rising doubt people have in the current financial system. His advice to invest in real assets like gold and Bitcoin matches what we’re seeing in the current scenario, as central banks are buying more gold, big investors are turning to Bitcoin , and more Americans are worried about growing U.S. debt and money printing. That said, while student loan debt is a huge problem, it may not be the only thing that could cause a financial crash. Experts are also watching other risks, like unpaid commercial property loans, more companies going bankrupt, and the government’s rising debt. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-19T08:16:34.000Z,"Bulls and Bears Get Caught off Guard as Bitcoin Jumps to $106K, Then Falls Back to $103K","Over $600 million in crypto derivatives positions have been liquidated since late Sunday as bitcoin (BTC) staged a sharp rally past $106,000 in the wee hours, only to reverse course and dump back to near $103,000, catching both bulls and bears off guard. The move began around 21:00 UTC on Sunday, when bitcoin spiked more than $2,500 in less than an hour — a pattern that can be attributed to thin weekend liquidity and potential algorithmic buying triggered by technical levels. Such price action was a textbook short squeeze followed by aggressive profit-taking or stop-run. A short squeeze happens when traders betting against a price (short sellers) are forced to buy the asset as it rises, to cover their losses, which pushes the price even higher and often very quickly. The sudden move wiped out over $460 million in long positions and $220 million in shorts, across futures tracking majors like ether (ETH), solana (SOL), and dogecoin (DOGE). The liquidation wave was notable for occurring during traditionally quiet weekend hours, an unusual event that marks forced selling or buying activity by a major player. SOL, DOGE and XRP prices are down more than 4% in the past 24 hours, data shows , with the broad-based CoinDesk (CD20) down more than 2%. The volatility follows a week of macro uncertainty, with Moody’s cutting the U.S. credit rating on Friday and inflation fears resurfacing after mixed economic data. The downgrade also led to U.S. 30-year treasury yields breaching the 5% mark. While crypto has broadly benefited from renewed institutional inflows and spot ETF momentum, traders remain cautious at current price levels, as reported . Bitcoin is flat over the past week, but the recent failure to hold above $106,000 — a key psychological and technical level — may signal near-term resistance, FxPro’s Alex Kuptsikevich told CoinDesk last week. Meanwhile, some traders anticipate higher volatility in the days to come in a warning sign for those looking to leverage their bets. “Investors are shifting capital to Bitcoin as concerns grow over a pending US spending bill that could add trillions in debt and push for higher Treasury premiums,” Haiyang Ru, co-CEO of the HashKey Business Group, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “But while bitcoin hovers just below new highs, we anticipate more market volatility as traders prepare for new trade deals and a final version of the fiscal policy,” Ru added.

2025-05-19T08:11:24.000Z,"Why Pi Network Listing on Coinbase Matters More Than Binance","The post Why Pi Network Listing on Coinbase Matters More Than Binance appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Many people in the Pi Network community are waiting for the big moment—when Pi finally gets listed on a major exchange like Binance. But for some, it’s not just about any exchange. It’s about Coinbase, the most trusted crypto platform in the U.S. According to crypto analyst Mr. Spock 𝛑 , a listing on Coinbase could unlock Pi’s true value and bring it closer to real-world use. Coinbase Isn’t Just an Exchange—It’s a Gateway to Utility Coinbase isn’t just another platform, it’s a fully regulated U.S.-based exchange, trusted by millions and deeply rooted in the American financial system. And when a coin gets listed on Coinbase, it doesn’t just become tradable, it becomes usable. Coinbase offers real-world tools, like the Coinbase Visa card, which lets users spend their crypto like cash. Mr. Spock explains his personal experience of how he uses this card to pay for food, shop at stores like Walmart, and even withdraw cash from ATMs, all while earning Bitcoin rewards on every purchase. He imagines a world where Pi Coin pays for meals, gas, and groceries, and rewards users with crypto benefits, not in theory, but in practice. Why Coinbase Is Better Than Binance for Pi Further, Mr. Spock also makes a strong case for why Coinbase matters more than Binance, especially in the U.S. He notes that Binance.com and Binance.US are completely separate, with the U.S. version offering fewer coins and features. Binance.com is unavailable to American users due to regulatory restrictions, while Binance.US operates under a different company with limited reach. On the other hand, Coinbase has regulatory clarity and deeper market integration, something Pi would benefit from if it wants to grow in the U.S. Pi’s Real Goal To Mr. Spock and many Pi supporters, this isn’t just about price—it’s about purpose. If Pi becomes spendable through Coinbase tools like the Visa card, it could finally blend crypto with daily life. That’s when the real impact begins, not just building wealth, but changing how we use money altogether. So while many are waiting for any exchange, some believe that waiting for Coinbase is worth it.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-pi-network-listing-on-coinbase-matters-more-than-binance/,"BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|BNB","News",cryptocompare

2025-05-19T08:03:49.000Z,"Arthur Hayes: Bitcoin must break through 110K for altseason to begin, Ethereum to outperform Solana","BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes says Bitcoin must break above $110,000 and climb toward $150,000–$200,000 for a true altcoin season to kick off. In a recent interview with Fortune published on May 18, Hayes predicted this breakout could occur sometime in June or early Q3, driven by rising liquidity and increased trading volume. Hayes, who now manages his family office Maelstrom, emphasized that the next altcoin cycle won’t resemble the explosive gains seen in 2021. He warned that many older tokens, what he called “dino coins,” are unlikely to recover due to high fully diluted valuations, limited float, and no real users or revenue. “You probably have a bunch of coins in your portfolio that went down 95%, and they’re not moving for a reason,” he said When asked about Ethereum ( ETH ) versus Solana ( SOL ), Hayes said he expects ETH to outperform in the upcoming bull cycle. Despite Solana’s significant rally from $7 to over $170, he pointed to Ethereum’s deeper fundamentals, highest total value locked, most developers, and stronger security from its proof-of-stake design as key advantages. You might also like: Altcoin season is over: Here’s what can make a project thrive | Opinion Hayes also doubled down on his long-term price prediction for Bitcoin ( BTC ), saying it could reach $1 million by the end of Donald Trump’s potential second term in 2028. For this year, he sees Bitcoin rising to around $250,000. On macro trends, Hayes criticized U.S. Treasury tactics for masking the country’s true borrowing needs. He believes the government is effectively spending more than reported by draining cash reserves and tapping underfunded programs. This, he said, creates excess dollar liquidity, an environment that favors Bitcoin and risk assets. Hayes also revealed that gold makes up 20% of his investment portfolio, including physical holdings and mining stocks. He expects central banks to keep buying gold and believes the U.S. may eventually revalue its gold holdings to help weaken the dollar. In his view, gold could reach $10,000–$20,000 before this market cycle ends. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading near $103,000, roughly 6% below its all-time high of $108,786 set earlier this year.

Long liquidations accompanied ETH’s price drop. Below $2,400 could be a buy-the-dip opportunity. Ether ( ETH ) price declined by over 4.5% in the last 24 hours to around $2,380 on May 19.

Ethereum leads crypto market sell-off ETH’s drop mirrored similar downside moves elsewhere in the cryptocurrency market, with the total capitalization falling by approximately 1.40% to $3.25 trillion. Bitcoin ( BTC ) saw modest losses, dropping 1% over the last 24 hours to trade above $102,900.

On May 17, the rating giant cut the US sovereign credit rating to Aa1 from Aaa, citing the country’s ballooning $36 trillion national debt , persistent fiscal deficit, rising interest expenses, and a lack of political will to rein in spending. This downgrade, the first from Moody’s since 1919, has rattled financial markets, pushing Treasury yields higher and triggering “risk-off” sentiment. “Yields are surging again following the Moody’s downgrade on Friday,” said capital markets commentator, The Kobeissi Letter, in a May 19 post on X, adding: “Trade deals, recession worries, lower inflation, and slowing GDP all can’t get lower yields.” Increasing US Treasury Bills.

Meanwhile, the US Federal Reserve remains adamant about not cutting rates , with market participants pricing in only two possible rate cuts in 2025, according to the CME Group FedWatch Tool . The downgrade signals higher economic uncertainty, prompting investors to withdraw from speculative assets, including crypto. Long liquidations accelerate ETH downtrend Ether’s tumble over the past 24 hours coincided with a wave of long liquidations that forced traders to exit their leveraged positions.

ETH bulls are now focused on the next area of interest between $2,330 and the $2,274 range low reached on May 9.

2025-05-19T08:02:32.000Z,"Australian Hacker Forfeits Assets in $2.88M Crime Proceeds Case","An Australian man has been forced to surrender nearly $2.88 million (4.5 million AUD) worth of assets—comprising Bitcoin, a waterfront mansion, and a Mercedes-Benz—after the Australian Federal Police (AFP) claimed the items were potentially acquired through a crime. The seizure was made by the AFP-led Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce (CACT), which announced the action in a statement issued on May 18. According to authorities, the case dates back to 2018 when Luxembourg law enforcement tipped off the AFP about suspicious Bitcoin transactions linked to the Queensland man. Investigators said they traced the activity back to earlier cyber offenses, including the theft of 950 Bitcoin from a French cryptocurrency exchange in 2013. Although no criminal charges were filed over the Bitcoin theft, a court ruled that the assets in question could not be tied to any legitimate income, leading to the forfeiture order issued in April. Ties to Crime and Gaming Industry Data Leaks Local media reports identified the individual as Shane Stephen Duffy, who pleaded guilty in 2016 to fraud and hacking charges. He was convicted of selling stolen personal data belonging to players of the popular online game League of Legends. While Duffy was not directly involved in the 2011 cyberattack on Riot Games that exposed data from over 5 million users, prosecutors confirmed he had obtained and resold the data independently. Further accusations included hacking the social media account of Riot Games’ president Marc Merrill to promote a service offering unauthorized access to players’ accounts. This crime history, along with the mystery surrounding the origin of Duffy’s wealth, contributed to the AFP’s decision to pursue asset forfeiture under the Proceeds of Crime Act. AFP Targets Criminal Profits to Fund Community Safety Commander Jason Kennedy of the AFP emphasized that the agency’s legal framework allows it to act decisively in confiscating assets suspected to be linked to criminal conduct—even without laying new charges. “The profits derived from criminal activities are also often used to fund further criminal acts,” Kennedy stated. “That’s why we work closely with our partners in the CACT to ensure such proceeds are reinvested in the community.” The confiscated assets will be sold, and the proceeds will go to a special purpose fund aimed at supporting law enforcement and crime prevention initiatives . Since July 2019, the CACT has restrained over $1.2 billion in criminally-linked assets, including luxury items like homes, vehicles, yachts, cryptocurrency, and fine art.

2025-05-19T08:00:52.000Z,"Crypto Watchlist: Top Analyst Reveals 5 Altcoins With Major Upside","In his latest market rundown, Amsterdam-based trader and educator Michaël van de Poppe warns that “retail isn’t here in the markets as of yet” and notes that the widely-followed Altcoin Season Index is still languishing around 29—well below the 50-point threshold that would signal a rotation out of Bitcoin and into the broader market. Against that still-cautious backdrop, Van de Poppe argues that the recent 38–42 percent rebound in the ETH/BTC pair is the first concrete sign of capital rotating down the risk curve, echoing on-chain data that show Ethereum clawing back ground after months of under-performance. “We’ve had a 40% return against Bitcoin in just a week,” he says, “and therefore the blue chips or the large caps are the ones to watch.” Crypto Watchlist: Top 5 Altcoins Van de Poppe’s thesis rests on a classic money-flow model: funds move from Bitcoin to Ethereum, then to large-cap altcoins, mid-caps and, finally, into the smallest caps once animal spirits truly take hold. With that framework in mind, he singles out five names that he believes sit at different rungs of the risk ladder, each with a specific macro- or sector-level tail-wind. Related Reading: Crypto Bulls Just Got Their Macro Wake-Up Call: Here’s Why The first pick, Chainlink (LINK), is Van de Poppe’s “easiest play” on institutional adoption because “we require oracles to provide data in the web-3 space to connect between web 2 and web 3.” The analyst emphasises that LINK’s bitcoin-denominated chart is “still at an all-time low,” suggesting asymmetric upside if a true altseason materialises. Next on the large-cap list is Aave (AAVE). Van de Poppe calls the decentralised lending protocol “a large cap which implies less risk,” but adds that the market is under-pricing its role in bringing bank-grade yield products on-chain. Notably, the token has attracted high-profile flows this cycle—Donald Trump–linked World Liberty Financial disclosed cumulative AAVE purchases alongside LINK and ETH earlier this year. Moving down the capitalization spectrum, the analyst turns to Wormhole (W), a cross-chain messaging and liquidity layer he describes as “being used to transfer between the chains,” with revenues that cycle back into the protocol. He flags its selection as exclusive bridge infrastructure for multiple real-world-asset initiatives in which “tokenised T-bill funds” migrate across networks. Wormhole’s fundamentals received a liquidity boost when Binance listed the W token with four trading pairs on 3 April 2024, broadening access for retail and institutional desks alike. Related Reading: Analysis: Crypto Heats Up As $35 Billion Enters Market In Under A Month For investors willing to venture further out on the risk curve, Van de Poppe highlights Peaq (PEAQ), a layer-1 focused on DePIN and the machine economy. “It’s the largest ecosystem within the machine economy and … finally waking up again,” he says, citing on-chain data that already show more than 50 companies and six-million devices active on the network. He argues that growing transaction counts and cross-industry partnerships make PEAQ “interesting for an investment thesis” at current valuations. His smallest-cap mention is Alkimi (ADS), which he dubs “an advertising project” whose revenue “has gone 4x from $1.2 million to $5 million” even as the token corrected from $0.50 to $0.10 during the recent macro-driven sell-off. Alkimi positions itself as a decentralised ad exchange designed to cut supply-chain fees and provide on-chain transparency, a use-case the company claims can slash CPMs by over 200 percent for advertisers. Van de Poppe closes with portfolio construction advice rather than price targets. “The larger the market cap, the longer it’s in business, the larger your allocation can be because the lower the risk involved. The smaller and newer the project, the smaller the allocation,” he says. At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $3.18 trillion.

Analysts suggest the top is not yet in, with some forecasts targeting $150,000 or even $220,000 later this year if bullish momentum continues. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Standing Out From Other Tokens Unlike most low-cap tokens vying for investor attention, MAGACOIN FINANCE has carved out a powerful niche. Its message resonates, its structure is sound, and its early support is strong enough to challenge more established names. Built on a platform of capped supply, cultural resonance, and clear direction, it’s quickly transitioning from outsider to contender. What mak es MAGACOIN FINANCE particularly interesting now is how early investors are treating it—as a long-term play, not just a trade. It’ s rare to see this level of commitment before listings even begin. And with social and market momentum continuing to rise, many believe this may be the only time to catch it before it breaks out fully. XRP (XRP): Parabolic Setup in Motion XRP is again in the spotlight, trading above $2.30 and showing signs of a classic parabolic breakout. The resolution of Ripple’s legal issues and the prospect of an XRP ETF have attracted institutional interest and renewed bullish sentiment. Technical analysts point to a breakout above $2.40 as a key signal, with targets ranging from $4.50 to $7 in the coming months Solana (SOL): Strong Fundamentals, Bullish Patterns Solana continues to impress, trading near $170 and consolidating just below major resistance. Technical indicators remain bullish, with the potential for a breakout above $200 to trigger a run toward $180–$190 in the coming months. Trumpcoin (TRUMP): Volatility and Political Hype Trumpcoin (TRUMP ) has seen bursts of activity tied to political sentiment, but its outlook for 2025 is mixed. Forecasts suggest a possible decline of over 40% this year, with limited upside compared to fundamentally stronger or more community-driven projects. While it may benefit from election-year , its long-term prospects remain uncertain. THE MOST-WATCHED PRESALE OF 2025 – ACT NOW Conclusion MAGACOIN FINANCE , stands out as the breakout presale, combining scarcity, viral appeal, and early-stage momentum for those seeking the next 20,000% winner. Trumpcoin, despite its political branding, appears less likely to deliver sustained gains.

On May 19, Buterin shared a post outlining how to make Ethereum’s layer-1 scaling “more friendly” to users running local nodes for personal use. The Ethereum co-founder highlighted the importance of independent users running nodes, saying that a market dominated by a few Remote Procedure Call (RPC) providers risks censorship. RPC providers let wallets, users and apps interact with the blockchain without running their own nodes. Crypto wallets are usually connected to an RPC provider behind the scenes. Buterin said there are risks to this setup. “A market structure dominated by a few RPC providers is one that will face strong pressure to deplatform or censor users. Many RPC providers already exclude entire countries,” Buterin wrote. Source: Vitalik Buterin Vitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes In addition to censorship, Buterin argued that reasons like expensive fully-trustless cryptographic solutions and metadata privacy show that there’s value in ensuring greater ease for those running a personal node. In the proposal, Buterin’s solution relies on a novel type of node called “partially stateless nodes.” They are designed to help users maintain privacy-preserving access to blockchain data without the heavy resource demands of running a full node. As Ethereum scales and the gas limit increases, running a full node requires more storage and bandwidth. Buterin said partially stateless nodes address the issue by allowing users to verify the blockchain and serve local data, but only store a subset of the Ethereum state, based on the user’s needs. Vitalik Buterin’s graphic of partially stateless nodes. Source: Vitalik Buterin Related: Ethereum Foundation unveils security initiative to supplant legacy systems A new node type to validate blocks “statelessly” The nodes would operate by validating blocks statelessly. This means they don’t require the storage of the full Merkle proofs or the entire blockchain history. They can selectively keep certain parts of the state up to date. This means that users could configure their nodes only to save data related to their accounts, the decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and their commonly used tokens like stablecoins and Ether ( ETH ). The rest of the data will be left out, and queries beyond the stored subset will fail or be routed through an RPC solution.

This move comes in the wake of Moody’s downgrading U.S. credit , stripping the country of Aaa rating due to mounting deficits and escalating interest expenses. The last time the long end of the yield curve reached 5% was on April 9, during the so-called \""tariff tantrum,\"" which triggered sharp sell-offs in both crypto and U.S. equity markets. At that time, bitcoin (BTC) was hovering near its local low of around $75,000. It has since rebounded strongly, currently trading around $103,000 after hitting a Sunday high of $106,000. “The last time the 30-year closed at or above 5% (at the 6 PM ET mark) was October 31, 2023. The highest closing yield in recent memory was 5.11% on October 19, 2023, the highest since July 2007, nearly 18 years ago. The current yield is just 12 basis points away from surpassing that milestone,” said Jim Bianco, head of Bianco Research. In addition, the United Kingdom surpassed China in March to become the second-largest foreign holder of U.S. Treasuries, with holdings totaling $779.3 billion—trailing only Japan, which remains the top foreign holder. Both China and Japan have continued to reduce their U.S. Treasury holdings over the past 12 months, underscoring the growing need for the U.S. to attract new buyers for its debt.

With the broader cryptocurrency market heating up again in May 2025, the race is on to find the next low-priced token with real potential. While Bitcoin has broken the $100,000 mark and Ethereum continues to dominate DeFi infrastructure, the spotlight is shifting to penny cryptocurrencies under $1—projects that are cheap now but backed by utility, transparency, and strong community engagement. Among these, Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) offers the perfect storm of meme culture, AI functionality, and long-term upside—all at a price tag of just $0.004. Let’s break down why this might be the best crypto to buy now before the next rally. Why Invest in Crypto Now May 2025 has kicked off a new phase in the market. Bitcoin's recent breakout has reawakened retail and institutional interest, while Ethereum has surpassed $62 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to DeFiLlama. From a macro perspective, bullish sentiment is returning due to global capital shifts, potential tax reforms, and growing blockchain adoption. Now isn’t just a good time to watch—it’s a time to act. Here’s why: The market is climbing, driven by institutional inflows. Penny cryptos offer affordable entry points for new and seasoned investors. Bullish narratives like AI, staking, and community-led growth are attracting capital. If you want to get in before the next bull run, this is the kind of market phase where fortunes are made.

2025-05-19T07:38:51.000Z,"How to read a Bitcoin liquidation map (without getting liquidated)","Understanding a Bitcoin liquidation map is imperative in dealing with the inherent volatility of the crypto market. The visual tool showcases probable liquidation levels, indicating where large orders may cause cascading price changes. This post explores how to interpret a Bitcoin liquidation map, allowing you to trade smarter in the volatile world of cryptocurrency. What is liquidation in crypto trading? In cryptocurrency trading , liquidation happens when an exchange forcefully closes a trader's leveraged position due to insufficient margin to pay losses. This usually occurs when the market moves sharply against the position. Long liquidations occur when prices fall, affecting traders who bet on an uptrend. Short liquidations happen when prices unexpectedly rise, impacting those who bet on a decline. Did you know? In crypto, a single liquidation cascade can wipe out millions in minutes, triggered not by hacking but by traders using too much leverage at the wrong time. What is a Bitcoin liquidation map? A Bitcoin liquidation map is a visual heatmap indicating price levels where large liquidations are expected to occur. These maps assist traders in identifying zones where leveraged positions may be closed forcibly if prices fluctuate sharply. Tools like CoinGlass provide real-time Bitcoin ( BTC ) liquidation maps, valuable resources for risk-aware traders. With the liquidation map, you can Use breakout trading strategies for profitable scalping opportunities. Set stop-loss levels based on key liquidation zones for better risk management. Target high-liquidity areas to secure profits efficiently. Enter large trades near liquidity clusters to minimize slippage and enhance execution. Analyze the gradient of liquidation intensity to anticipate potential price movements.. Functioning of a liquidation map and key components The X-axis of the liquidation chart represents the bid price, while the Y-axis denotes the relative strength of liquidation activity. Each column on the graphic illustrates a liquidation cluster's relative significance compared to other clusters. The chart demonstrates how the market will respond if the price reaches certain thresholds. Taller liquidation bars indicate a higher potential impact. The various hues are solely for visual clarity, allowing users to distinguish between distinct liquidation zones. Here are the main components of a liquidation map: Heat zones: Indicate where most positions could be eliminated if the price reaches specific levels. Liquidity pools: Collections of stop-loss and liquidation orders that can cause rapid price movements. Open interest levels: Demonstrate where large amounts of leveraged positions are concentrated. Price imbalances or gaps: Disclose areas without support or resistance, allowing prices to move swiftly. Did you know? Crypto liquidations often follow the herd; when too many traders place similar bets, liquidation maps light up and whales use them as price targets. How to use a liquidation map in your Bitcoin trading strategy A Bitcoin liquidation map provides insights into probable price movements and risk zones by visually representing places where leveraged positions will likely be closed. Here is how to use a liquidation map in Bitcoin trading: Identify high-risk zones: Identify places with dense liquidation clusters to avoid overleveraging. These areas come across as magnets, attracting price changes that might cause a series of liquidations. Time entry and exit: Liquidation clusters help find the optimal entry and exit points. Entering and exiting trades before a cluster becomes risky helps you lock in profits before reversals. Combine with technical indicators: Enhance your research by combining liquidation maps with tools such as support/resistance levels and relative strength index (RSI) . This sets out a comprehensive view of market conditions. Avoid herd mentality: Exercise caution in places with high leverage concentrations. Such zones may be traps constructed by larger players to induce liquidations and profit from the resulting volatility. Monitor whale activity: Large traders frequently target liquidation zones to turn price moves to their advantage. Observing these patterns can provide insights about prospective market movements. Anticipate reversals: Markets frequently experience reversals following large liquidation events. Recognizing these trends can aid in positioning for possible rebounds. Implement robust risk management: Use stop-loss orders and handle leverage carefully. Liquidation maps can help you determine where to put these orders to minimize exposure. Common mistakes to avoid when using the Bitcoin liquidation map Using a Bitcoin liquidation map can enhance trading decisions, but misinterpretation can lead to costly errors. Here are common mistakes you need to avoid: Blindly trading toward liquidity zones: If you are trading toward liquidity zones without thinking, expect reversals. Misreading map colors or scale : Making a mistake in judging map colors or scale can skew your risk assessment. Over-relying on liquidation data without context : Maps are valuable tools, not an assurance that what they reflect will happen. Ignoring macro news or sentiment analysis : External events often override technical signals. A sudden event may make all predictions fall flat. Always combine liquidation maps with broader technical analysis. Smart trading requires context, not just colorful charts. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-19T07:38:33.000Z,"Vitalik Buterin: Ethereum should become more friendly to users running local nodes","Vitalik Buterin posted a suggestion on making Ethereum more friendly to users running local nodes. His latest proposition is linked to attempts to scale the L1 chain, which still suffers from high gas prices and growing demand for data. Vitalik Buterin proposed changes to Ethereum aiming to make the network more friendly to users running nodes. Buterin stated it’s important to run a full node and a personal RPC server, hoping to bring more users onboard with Ethereum nodes. Currently, running a node is restricted and resource-heavy. The chain has 10,051 active nodes as of May 19. The full data of the chain is at 1,312 GB and growing. In the past year, with all active DeFi and L2 verifications, the data load for Ethereum has grown by over 20%, with a trend to preserve that pace. Ethereum nodes are still concentrated in the USA and Europe, both for the consensus and execution layer. Vitalik Buterin proposed lighter requirements for running personal RPC nodes with limited archives. | Source: Ethernodes.org The Ethereum network still hinges on data centers in developed countries, with around 30% of consensus and execution nodes located in the USA and concentrated on the East Coast. Germany is the second key location for ETH nodes. New proposal offers lighter versions of RPC nodes The bottleneck for Ethereum is also the availability of RPC providers. A smaller pool of providers may resort to censorship, as currently some RPC nodes exclude entire countries, noted Buterin in his longer explanation of eventual updates. Ethereum may add a new type of node with a lower data requirement, which could verify transactions and further decentralize the network. Some users may run partial-state nodes, storing contracts and transactions only relevant to their own use cases. The end goal is to encourage smaller players to run RPC nodes, removing the risk of monopolizing Ethereum between big players. The update on L1 scaling arrives at a time when Ethereum handles 1.38M transactions per day, following renewed interest in DeFi and ETH trading. The chain has disproven claims of being dead or displaced, leading to calls for more relevance and L1 speed. The message from Buterin failed to recover the ETH price, which dropped to $2,375.66, just days after holding above $2,500 . Vitalik Buterin puts priority status on EIP-4444 One of the steps to making Ethereum easier for node operators is to prioritize EIP-4444. The end goal is to have nodes that store full data for only 36 days. This will reduce storage requirements, one of the main obstacle to running even more nodes. The EIP-4444 changes will affect the entire network, with clients no longer serving some of the data that is older than a year through P2P transactions. Clients may locally prune historical data. Full RPC nodes will coexist with archive nodes, which have provided the large and ever-expanding history of the network. The chain has envisioned up to $1 trillion in assets, including ETH, stablecoins, tokens, and NFTs, as well as tokenized securities, requiring reliable historical nodes. On the other hand, verification and short-term transaction processing may become easier without the outsized demand for storage.

Analyst Shares Annual Return Forecast for BTC","Famous cryptocurrency analyst Willy Woo shared a remarkable analysis on Bitcoin's (BTC) annual compound return rate (CAGR). Woo noted that investors have unrealistic expectations about BTC and drew attention to the changes that have occurred over the years. Woo shared on social media, “People see BTC as an asset that rises forever. However, the real CAGR chart is obvious.” Woo, who reminded that Bitcoin's annual returns exceeded 100% in 2017, argued that this period is now behind us. Chart shared by Woo comparing the annualized rate of return on Bitcoin to the SP500. The analyst evaluated 2020 as a turning point. Stating that this year was a period when Bitcoin was adopted by institutional investors and even some states, Woo stated that with this institutionalization, the annual compound return dropped to 30-40% and this rate continued to decrease over time.

2025-05-19T08:55:00.000Z,"Crypto drainers as a service: What you need to know","What is a crypto drainer?              A crypto drainer is a malicious script designed to steal cryptocurrency from your wallet. Unlike regular phishing attacks that try to capture login credentials, a crypto drainer tricks you into connecting your wallets, such as MetaMask or Phantom, and unknowingly authorizing transactions that grant them access to your funds.Disguised as a legitimate Web3 project, a crypto drainer is usually promoted via compromised social media accounts or Discord groups. Once you fall prey to the fraud, the drainer can instantly transfer assets from the wallet.Crypto drainers may take various forms:Malicious smart contracts that initiate unauthorized transfers.Fake NFTs or token systems that create deceptive exchanges or assets.Crypto drainers are a growing threat in Web3, enabling quick, automated theft of crypto assets from unsuspecting users through deception. Common methods of crypto drainers include: Phishing websites.Fake airdrops.Deceptive ads.Malicious smart contracts.Harmful browser extensions.Fake NFT marketplaces.                  Crypto drainers-as-a-service (DaaS), explained              DaaS elevates the threat of crypto drainers by commercializing them. Just like  software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms, DaaS platforms sell ready-to-use malware kits to cybercriminals, often in exchange for a percentage of the stolen funds.In the DaaS model, developers offer turnkey draining scripts, customizable phishing kits and even integration help in exchange for a share of the stolen funds. A DaaS offer might be bundled with social engineering support, anonymization services and regular updates, making them attractive even to low-skill scammers.Types of crypto DaaS tools include:JavaScript-based drainers: Malicious JavaScript is embedded into phishing websites that mimic legitimate decentralized apps (DApps). These scripts execute when you connect your wallet, silently triggering approval transactions that drain assets. Token approval malware: Tricks users into granting unlimited token access via malicious smart contracts.Clipboard hijackers: Hackers use clipboard hijackers to monitor and replace copied wallet addresses with those controlled by attackers. Info-stealers: They harvest browser data, wallet extensions and private keys. Some DaaS packages combine these with loader malware that drops additional payloads or updates the malicious code. Modular drainer kits: Segregated into modules, these drainers use obfuscation techniques to bypass browser-based security tools. Did you know? According to Scam Sniffer, phishing campaigns using wallet drainers siphoned off over $295 million in NFTs and tokens from unsuspecting users in 2023.                  What crypto DaaS kits include              Crypto DaaS kits are pre-built toolsets sold to scammers, enabling them to steal digital assets with minimal technical skill. These kits typically include phishing page templates, malicious smart contracts, wallet-draining scripts and more.This is what crypto DaaS kits generally include:Pre-built drainer software: Plug-and-play malware requiring minimal setup.Phishing kits: DaaS providers supply customizable phishing website templates that hackers can modify according to their plans.Social engineering: With DaaS, hackers find support for social engineering along with psychological tactics to trick users into connecting their wallets.Operational security (OPSEC) tools: To avoid detection, some DaaS vendors offer advanced operational security tools that mask user identity and hide digital footprints.Integration assistance and/obfuscation: These services help attackers deploy drainer scripts seamlessly and use obfuscation tools to evade tracking.Regular updates: Frequent improvements are designed to bypass wallet defenses and detection systems.User-friendly dashboards: Control panels that help attackers oversee operations and monitor drained funds.Documentation and tutorials: Step-by-step instructions enabling even beginners to execute scams efficiently.Customer support: Some DaaS operators provide real-time help through secure messaging apps like Telegram.With DaaS kits available for as little as $100 to $500, or through subscription models, sophisticated crypto attacks are no longer limited to experienced hackers. Even the inexperienced can now access these scripts with a small budget, effectively democratizing this type of crime.Did you know? Advanced DaaS tools often update scripts to evade detection from browser extensions like WalletGuard and security alerts issued by MetaMask or Trust Wallet.                  Evolution of crypto drainers as prominent fraudulent activity              The threat landscape of cryptocurrency fraud is constantly evolving. Emerging around 2021, crypto drainers have rapidly transformed the landscape. Their ability to stealthily siphon funds from users' wallets has made them a threat that demands vigilance.Drainers specifically designed to target MetaMask began to emerge around 2021 and were openly advertised on illicit online forums and marketplaces.Here are some prominent drainers that have been around for some time:Chick Drainer: It emerged in late 2023, targeting Solana (SOL) users through phishing campaigns. It operates using the CLINKSINK script, embedded in fake airdrop websites.Rainbow Drainer: The platform shares code similarities with Chick Drainer, suggesting potential reuse or collaboration among threat actors.Angel Drainer: Launched around August 2023, Angel Drainer is widely promoted on Telegram by threat groups like GhostSec. Affiliate scammers need to make an upfront payment between $5,000 and $10,000 and also pay a 20% commission on all stolen assets facilitated through its platform.Rugging’s Drainer: Compatible with several crypto platforms, this DaaS drainer offers comparatively low commission fees, typically ranging from 5% to 10% of the stolen proceeds. In the wake of the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s X account being compromised in January 2024, Chainalysis found a crypto drainer acting as the SEC. This led users to connect their wallets in an attempt to claim nonexistent airdropped tokens.According to a Kaspersky Security Bulletin, dark web threads discussing crypto drainers rose sharply in 2024, jumping by 135% to 129 threads from 55 in 2022. These conversations encompass a wide range of topics, including buying and selling malicious software and forming distribution teams.As the following chart demonstrates, crypto drainers have been stealing crypto at a faster quarterly growth rate than even ransomware.                  Red flags to identify a crypto DaaS attack              Spotting a crypto wallet drainer attack early is crucial to minimizing potential losses and securing your assets. You must be careful, as a sophisticated drainer attack can sometimes evade standard alert mechanisms. You must remain vigilant even while relying on automated tools. Here are a few indicators that your wallet may be under threat:Unusual transactions: A red flag of a drainer attack is finding transactions you didn’t authorize. These may include unexpected token transfers or withdrawals to unknown wallet addresses. Sometimes, attackers execute multiple small transfers to avoid detection, so you must monitor for repeated unusual transactions of low-value crypto. Lost access to wallet: If you cannot access your wallet or your funds are missing, it could mean an attacker has taken control. This often happens when the drainer changes private keys or recovery phrases, effectively locking you out. Security alerts from wallet providers: Your crypto wallet may issue security alerts for suspicious actions, like logins from new devices, failed access attempts or unauthorized transactions. These warnings indicate that someone may be trying to access your wallet or has already accessed it.Fake project websites or DApps: If you find a cloned or newly launched platform mimicking a real Web3 service and prompting wallet connections, it is a warning sign of a crypto drainer. It might also have urgent calls to action, urging users to immediately claim rewards, airdrops, or mint NFTs. The objective is to pressure victims into connecting wallets without verifying authenticity.Unverified social media promotions: Suspicious links shared via X, Discord, Telegram or Reddit, often unverified profiles, indicate a fraudulent attempt to drain money from a wallet. Fraudsters may also use compromised accounts to share malicious links. Unaudited smart contracts: Interacting with unfamiliar contracts without public audits or GitHub transparency can expose wallets to hidden drainer scripts.Wallet prompts requesting broad permissions: Sign-in or approval requests that ask for full token spending access or access to all assets, rather than specific transactions, are serious warning signs.Did you know? Just one popular drainer kit can be used by hundreds of affiliates. That means a single DaaS platform can be behind thousands of wallet thefts in a matter of days.                  How to protect your crypto wallet from DaaS attackers              To protect your crypto wallet from DaaS attackers, adopting strong, proactive security practices is essential. Blockchain monitoring tools can help identify suspicious patterns linked to drainer activity, allowing you to respond quickly. Here are key strategies to help protect your digital assets:Use hardware wallets: Hardware wallets, or cold wallets, store private keys offline, shielding them from online threats like malware and phishing. Keeping your keys in a physical device significantly lowers the risk of remote attacks and is ideal for securing long-term crypto holdings.Enable 2FA (two-factor authentication): Adding 2FA to your wallet means even if someone steals your password, they will need a second verification step. They need to put in a verification code sent to your phone to access the account, along with your password, making unauthorized access much harder.Avoid phishing links: Always verify URLs and avoid clicking on unsolicited messages claiming rewards or updates. Never input private keys or seed phrases on suspicious sites. When in doubt, manually enter the correct website address.Secure your private keys and seed phrases: Store your private keys and seed phrases offline in a safe, physical location. Never save these credentials on internet-connected devices, or hackers might get access to them, putting your wallet at risk. Verify apps and browser extensions: Take care to install software only from official sources. Research apps beforehand to avoid malicious or fake tools.Monitor wallet activity regularly: Check your wallet for unauthorized transactions or unusual patterns. Early detection can help stop further losses and improve recovery chances.                  What to do if you suffer from a crypto-drainer attack              Swift action is essential if you suspect your crypto wallet has been compromised. Though fund recovery is rare, quick action can limit further losses.Here are the steps you need to take if you suffer from a crypto DaaS attack:Secure your accounts: Immediately change the password for your wallet and enable 2FA, if you still have access to it. Transfer any remaining funds to a secure, uncompromised wallet.Notify your wallet provider or exchange: Report the incident to your wallet provider or exchange. You could request them to monitor your account or freeze suspicious activity. Platforms may flag suspicious addresses or prevent further transfers.File a report with authorities: Contact local law enforcement or cybercrime units, as cryptocurrency theft is treated as a financial crime in most regions.Seek professional assistance: Cybersecurity firms specializing in blockchain forensics can analyze transactions and potentially trace the stolen funds. While full recovery is unlikely, especially if assets pass through mixers or bridges, expert help may aid investigations.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/crypto-drainers-as-a-service-what-you-need-to-know?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The team claimed to have immediately responded and taken action involving multiple departments, including the firm’s chief operating officer, Helen Liu.Other people involved in the operation were the heads of customer service, risk control, the Chinese-language division, product managers and the technical team. The exchange coordinated its actions with the user.After an internal investigation, Bybit concluded this was a “unique case affecting an individual user, not a systemic issue.” The account’s KYC information was not tampered with and the funds in the account remained secure at all times.Bybit had not answered Cointelegraph’s request for comment at the time of writing.Related: A decade-old debate is back as self-custody gets smarterThe perks of media attentionBybit claims to have taken large-scale and timely action, which involved a member of its executive team, all in response to an issue reported by a single user. Chinese-speaking X crypto influencer EnHeng claimed to be the reason for this.In a separate post that Bybit’s X post answers to — EnHeng explained that in a group chat, he noticed “a girl mentioned a bug related to Bybit’s Apple ID.” He verified the issue and after confirming that it was real, flagged it to Bybit.EnHeng said that the staff responded quickly and assisted the user in recovering access to about $100,000 worth of funds. They highlighted:“This incident really made me feel the value of having influence.”EnHeng said “in this market, retail investors often lack a voice and are vulnerable.” For this reason, he said, “When we have more resources and a bigger voice, we should use them to speak up for retail investors.”Related: Self-custody vs. centralized crypto cards: Freedom or convenience?Locked out of exchangeBeing locked out of a cryptocurrency exchange account or some of its features is not excessively uncommon. Often, it is an emergency measure meant to prevent fund losses.A recent example is Phemex crypto exchange halting withdrawals after being alerted to nearly $30 million worth of suspicious outflows that raised alarms among blockchain security firms in late January. Indian cryptocurrency exchange Mudrex temporarily halted crypto withdrawals during the same month, claiming compliance improvements were the reason.Sometimes action is taken on the request of law enforcement. Last summer, a small set of Palestinian user accounts was frozen after Israeli authorities issued a seizure request. Also last summer, OKX warned it would terminate any account linked to crypto mixer Tornado Cash or sanctioned addresses, and several users said their log-ins were suddenly disabled.Those incidents echo an old adage popular in the Bitcoin (BTC) community: Not your keys, not your coins.

2025-05-19T07:55:20.000Z,"Vitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes for Ethereum scaling","Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin unveiled a proposal to preserve trustless, censorship-resistant access to Ethereum, even as the network scales. On May 19, Buterin shared a post outlining how to make Ethereum's layer-1 scaling “more friendly” to users running local nodes for personal use. The Ethereum co-founder highlighted the importance of independent users running nodes, saying that a market dominated by a few Remote Procedure Call (RPC) providers risks censorship. RPC providers let wallets, users and apps interact with the blockchain without running their own nodes. Crypto wallets are usually connected to an RPC provider behind the scenes. Buterin believes there are risks to this setup. “A market structure dominated by a few RPC providers is one that will face strong pressure to deplatform or censor users. Many RPC providers already exclude entire countries,” Buterin wrote. Source: Vitalik ButerinVitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes In addition to censorship, Buterin argued that reasons like expensive fully-trustless cryptographic solutions and metadata privacy show that there’s value in ensuring greater ease for those running a personal node. In the proposal, Buterin's solution relies on a novel type of node called “partially stateless nodes.” These nodes are designed to help users maintain privacy-preserving access to blockchain data without the heavy resource demands of running a full node. As Ethereum scales and the gas limit increases, running a full node requires more storage and bandwidth. Buterin said partially stateless nodes address the issue by allowing users to verify the blockchain and serve local data, but only store a subset of the Ethereum state, based on the user’s needs.Vitalik Buterin’s graphic of partially stateless nodes. Source: Vitalik ButerinRelated: Ethereum Foundation unveils security initiative to supplant legacy systemsA new node type to validate blocks “statelessly”The nodes would operate by validating blocks statelessly. This means they don't require the storage of the full Merkle proofs or the entire blockchain history. They can selectively keep certain parts of the state up to date. This means that users could configure their nodes only to save data related to their accounts, the decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, and their commonly used tokens like stablecoins and Ether (ETH). The rest of the data will be left out, and queries beyond the stored subset will fail or be routed through an RPC solution. Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/vitalik-buterin-partially-stateless-nodes-ethereum-scaling-privacy?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-19T07:38:51.000Z,"How to read a Bitcoin liquidation map (without getting liquidated)","Understanding a Bitcoin liquidation map is imperative in dealing with the inherent volatility of the crypto market. The visual tool showcases probable liquidation levels, indicating where large orders may cause cascading price changes. This post explores how to interpret a Bitcoin liquidation map, allowing you to trade smarter in the volatile world of cryptocurrency.What is liquidation in crypto trading?In cryptocurrency trading, liquidation happens when an exchange forcefully closes a trader's leveraged position due to insufficient margin to pay losses. This usually occurs when the market moves sharply against the position. Long liquidations occur when prices fall, affecting traders who bet on an uptrend. Short liquidations happen when prices unexpectedly rise, impacting those who bet on a decline. Did you know? In crypto, a single liquidation cascade can wipe out millions in minutes, triggered not by hacking but by traders using too much leverage at the wrong time.What is a Bitcoin liquidation map?A Bitcoin liquidation map is a visual heatmap indicating price levels where large liquidations are expected to occur. These maps assist traders in identifying zones where leveraged positions may be closed forcibly if prices fluctuate sharply. Tools like CoinGlass provide real-time Bitcoin (BTC) liquidation maps, valuable resources for risk-aware traders. With the liquidation map, you canUse breakout trading strategies for profitable scalping opportunities.Set stop-loss levels based on key liquidation zones for better risk management.Target high-liquidity areas to secure profits efficiently.Enter large trades near liquidity clusters to minimize slippage and enhance execution.Analyze the gradient of liquidation intensity to anticipate potential price movements..Functioning of a liquidation map and key components The X-axis of the liquidation chart represents the bid price, while the Y-axis denotes the relative strength of liquidation activity. Each column on the graphic illustrates a liquidation cluster's relative significance compared to other clusters.The chart demonstrates how the market will respond if the price reaches certain thresholds. Taller liquidation bars indicate a higher potential impact. The various hues are solely for visual clarity, allowing users to distinguish between distinct liquidation zones.Here are the main components of a liquidation map:Heat zones: Indicate where most positions could be eliminated if the price reaches specific levels.Liquidity pools: Collections of stop-loss and liquidation orders that can cause rapid price movements.Open interest levels: Demonstrate where large amounts of leveraged positions are concentrated.Price imbalances or gaps: Disclose areas without support or resistance, allowing prices to move swiftly.Did you know? Crypto liquidations often follow the herd; when too many traders place similar bets, liquidation maps light up and whales use them as price targets.How to use a liquidation map in your Bitcoin trading strategyA Bitcoin liquidation map provides insights into probable price movements and risk zones by visually representing places where leveraged positions will likely be closed. Here is how to use a liquidation map in Bitcoin trading:Identify high-risk zones: Identify places with dense liquidation clusters to avoid overleveraging. These areas come across as magnets, attracting price changes that might cause a series of liquidations.Time entry and exit: Liquidation clusters help find the optimal entry and exit points. Entering and exiting trades before a cluster becomes risky helps you lock in profits before reversals.Combine with technical indicators: Enhance your research by combining liquidation maps with tools such as support/resistance levels and relative strength index (RSI). This sets out a comprehensive view of market conditions.Avoid herd mentality: Exercise caution in places with high leverage concentrations. Such zones may be traps constructed by larger players to induce liquidations and profit from the resulting volatility.Monitor whale activity: Large traders frequently target liquidation zones to turn price moves to their advantage. Observing these patterns can provide insights about prospective market movements.Anticipate reversals: Markets frequently experience reversals following large liquidation events. Recognizing these trends can aid in positioning for possible rebounds.Implement robust risk management: Use stop-loss orders and handle leverage carefully. Liquidation maps can help you determine where to put these orders to minimize exposure.Common mistakes to avoid when using the Bitcoin liquidation mapUsing a Bitcoin liquidation map can enhance trading decisions, but misinterpretation can lead to costly errors. Here are common mistakes you need to avoid:Blindly trading toward liquidity zones: If you are trading toward liquidity zones without thinking, expect reversals.Misreading map colors or scale: Making a mistake in judging map colors or scale can skew your risk assessment.Over-relying on liquidation data without context: Maps are valuable tools, not an assurance that what they reflect will happen.Ignoring macro news or sentiment analysis: External events often override technical signals. A sudden event may make all predictions fall flat.Always combine liquidation maps with broader technical analysis.

Source: PACERCoinbase reported on May 15 that four days earlier it had been hit with a $20 million extortion attempt after cybercriminals bribed several of its customer support agents to access internal systems and steal a limited amount of user account data.The stolen data included names, addresses, phone numbers, emails, the last four digits of Social Security numbers, some bank account identifiers, driver’s licenses, passports and some account data, such as balance snapshots and transaction history.Bender claimed that “Coinbase failed to implement and maintain reasonable security safeguards,” which exposed users to “serious and ongoing risks.”The suit also claimed Coinbase’s response to the incident was “inadequate, fragmented, and delayed.”“Users were not promptly or fully informed of the compromise, and Coinbase did not immediately take meaningful steps to mitigate further harm,  provide identity protection services, or offer actionable guidance to affected individuals,” the complaint claimed.The lawsuit claimed users could face “substantial, immediate, and ongoing threat of identity theft and financial fraud” and that the consequences of the breach could be long-term or “potentially permanent” because the compromised information can’t be recovered or made secure once exposed.Flurry of lawsuits make similar allegations Two other lawsuits filed in a New York federal court made similar claims against Coinbase, while a fourth lawsuit added the allegation of unjust enrichment, arguing that Coinbase didn’t spend enough on data security measures.All four complaints ask for damages and other measures to help protect the plaintiff’s sensitive data.Meanwhile, a fifth lawsuit filed in a California federal court on May 15 made similar claims against Coinbase, but asked the court to order Coinbase to purge all sensitive data it holds about the plaintiffs and hire third-party security auditors to test its security systems, among other requests.A Coinbase spokesperson did not comment on the lawsuits and instead pointed Cointelegraph to a blog post it shared regarding the data breaches.Coinbase said it refused to pay the $20 million ransom and has flagged plans to reimburse users tricked into sending crypto to phishing scammers due to the data breach.In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the exchange said it expects reimbursement expenses ranging from $180 million to $400 million.Related: Retired artist loses $2M in crypto to Coinbase impersonatorThe exchange also reportedly fired a group of customer support agents based in India following their alleged involvement in social engineering attacks on users.Coinbase (COIN) shares dipped 7% and dropped to $244 after it disclosed the data breach along with an ongoing SEC probe over misstated user numbers in 2021.The stock has since staged a comeback, spiking 9% and hitting $266 by the closing bell on May 16, according to Google Finance. Coinbase has climbed even higher following the data breach.

Bitcoin developer John Carvalho introduced Bitcoin Improvement Proposal-177 on April 23, which seeks to eliminate the concept of satoshis, of which there are 100,000,000 in 1 Bitcoin (BTC), and effectively split Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million into 21 quadrillion units.It follows a 2017 proposal from Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song to create “bits,” representing one-millionth of 1 Bitcoin. However, Carvalho said Song’s approach would still require Bitcoin users to think about decimals and “shifts complexity rather than eliminating it.”Block Inc. CEO Jack Dorsey is among those calling for the change, saying in a May 18 X post that satoshis, or sats, are too confusing for newcomers.“Bits of Bitcoin is better, and just Bitcoin is best,” Dorsey said.Dorsey pointed to a December 2024 discussion on the topic where Stevie Lee, product lead of Bitcoin infrastructure firm Spiral, argued that not enough people know or care about what satoshis are.“Everyone knows Bitcoin, no one knows sats, people just want to send and receive Bitcoin,” Lee said, recalling past conversations where people thought satoshis were an entirely new token, unrelated to Bitcoin.He added that the Bitcoin community shouldn’t be too concerned with the change, as they know the underlying economics of Bitcoin would remain intact.Related: DOJ charges 12 more gamer-turned $263M Bitcoin robbersSwan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten and Byte Federal director of product Michelle Weekley were among those who opposed the change.“People understand cents in a dollar, they will understand sats in a Bitcoin,” Weekley said on X.Magdalena Gronowska, a self-described Bitcoin consultant, claimed that the change could make some people think that Bitcoin abruptly crashed from its current price of around $100,000 and that its “supply has massively inflated.”Zaprite business development lead Parker Lewis argued that sats were easier to understand.

2025-05-18T15:00:00.000Z,"Don’t believe the noise: There can never be too many L2s","Opinion by: Igor Mandrigin, co-founder and CTPO of Gateway.fmEvery couple of weeks, it seems another layer 2 rolls out, much to the chagrin of some Web3 industry commentators who are concerned about fragmentation. A recent Gemini Institutional Insights report actually noted how a new Ethereum L2 solution is launched approximately every 19 days. In response to the seemingly endless conveyor belt of new zkEVMs and optimistic rollups coming to market, the chorus of criticism continues to grow louder: “This is definitely the saturation point, no more chains are needed.”Some of the most outspoken critics of L2s argue that L2s are redundant, but this is narrow thinking. In many ways, the idea that creating new L2s should be slowed down is like arguing that there were too many websites in 1998. The proliferation of L2s is not causing the Web3 space to become overly bloated or fragmented at all. The number of chains today isn’t too many. It’s laughably few, and right now is the early innings of a multi-decade explosion in specialized, modular blockchain infrastructure.The rise of L2s is far from a passing fadWhile some contend that this L2 surge we’ve been experiencing is merely a temporary frenzy led by DeFi degenerates, it’s really an enterprise-grade infrastructure expansion, as banks (including Deutsche Bank), game studios (gaming activity on some L2 blockchains rose by over 20,000% in February 2025), logistics networks and global manufacturers get on board. Industries like banking and logistics, which are typically risk-averse, don’t make major tech pivots lightly. They do so because they have to, and in many cases, public blockchains do not meet their needs. Returning to their inherent risk-averse DNA, large enterprises and institutions in these sectors generally won’t want to build on shared, general-purpose L1s. Instead, they’ll want to deploy their own chains where they can enjoy custom performance, predictable costs, jurisdictional compliance and granular-level privacy.This focus on proprietary networks isn’t solely a Web3 thing. Let’s think about it. Did Facebook, Netflix and JPMorgan co-host on GeoCities? Of course not, so why would Web3 be any different? Shared L1s and monolithic architectures might have worked for early token experiments and composable DeFi primitives. Still, realistically, they can’t support real-world businesses’ complexity, regulatory burden or contractual requirements.The growing viability of L2sThanks to modular stacks, rollup-as-a-service platforms and breakthrough zero-knowledge proof technology, spinning up a dedicated chain is becoming increasingly viable and accessible to a wide range of enterprises across the industry spectrum. As the infrastructure improves, the cost of launching and maintaining specialized chains will also reduce, so a substantial rise in the number of L2s can be expected as time goes on.Recent: Devs introduce Ethereum R1 layer-2 scaling solutionSome onlookers will argue that this future will be convoluted for users forced to hop between chains while voicing concerns about liquidity fragmentation and the dispersal of tradable assets across multiple platforms. These are short-sighted concerns. We’re building toward seamless interoperability through shared settlement layers, trust-minimized bridges and unified account abstraction. Ultimately, the end-user won’t care whether they’re on rollup #4,318 or chain #9,072; they’ll just transact with ease and be happy with that. In the same way that cloud computing unlocked hyper scale by abstracting the hardware layer, modular blockchains are unlocking hyperscale for value transfer, asset issuance and programmable trust. Irrespective of what the doubters say, specialized L2s won’t cannibalize each other. They’ll serve different verticals, jurisdictions and use cases. There is no reason why an L2 for high-frequency trading can’t easily coexist with an L2 for national land registries.We’re not drowning in chains — we’re barely ankle-deep in the grand scheme of things. Anyone seriously betting on consolidation or some magical “winner-take-all” chain is just betting against scale and sovereignty. The real bet is hundreds of L2s and thousands of use cases as part of one modular, scalable future.Opinion by: Igor Mandrigin, co-founder and CTPO of Gateway.fm.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

He pushed for a configurable, default policy discouraging the use of Bitcoin for storing JPEGs rather than monetary data.Blockstream CEO Adam Back challenged the proposal, describing inscription filtering as an “arms race.” He noted that spam data embedded in Bitcoin transactions can be endlessly modified using code structures, requiring constant updates to filtering tools.Source: Adam BackRelated: Bitcoin Ordinals vs. Ethereum NFTs: A comparative overviewAmmous compares Bitcoin spam to emailAmmous compared the Bitcoin spam issue to email spam — another arms race society continues to fight without abandoning the system.“It’s not easy, but it’s worth trying to help bankrupt the spammers faster,” Ammous said. He argued that fighting spam is not censorship, noting that node operators already reject invalid transactions.“So a node runner looking to remove retards' spam is no less valid than retards' spam,” he added.The debate drew commentary from other users. One participant suggested Core developers treat spam-coding employees at certain startups as “unwilling QA engineers” and simply unstandardize every trick they deploy.Ammous took it further, proposing to “deprecate” the work of developers building spam tools and even hiring outside coders to overwhelm their systems.Source: Saifedean AmmousThe conversation reflects ongoing tensions in the Bitcoin community over the network’s intended use. With inscriptions continuing to congest the network, calls for technical countermeasures — and pointed critiques of those defending spam — are growing louder.In a Feb. 4 report, Mempool Research said the adoption of inscriptions could drive the Bitcoin network’s average block size as high as 4 megabytes (MB) per block, far higher than current averages.Bitcoin’s average block size — the amount of data in each block posted to the network’s public ledger — is currently around 1.5 MB.Magazine: Arthur Hayes $1M Bitcoin tip, altcoins’ powerful rally’ looms: Hodler’s Digest, May 11 – 17",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/saifedean-ammous-funds-dev-to-fight-bitcoin-spam?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The suspects allegedly recruited others to open bank accounts to receive proceeds from fraud cases, which were then converted into crypto at crypto exchange shops to launder the illicit funds, Hong Kong Commercial Daily reported on May 17.The criminal organization rented a residential unit in the Hong Kong neighborhood of Mong Kok to plan and carry out its money laundering activities. Of the $15 million laundered, more than $1.2 million was linked to 58 reported fraud cases.Caught in actionThe bust followed police surveillance on May 15, when two recruits left the syndicate’s Mong Kok base — one visiting a bank, the other an ATM — before both went to convert the cash into crypto at a crypto exchange shop in the neighborhood of Tsim Sha Tsui.Police arrested both individuals on the spot, seizing around HK$770,000 ($98,540) in cash before the funds could be laundered. The other 10 individuals, aged between 20 and 41, were arrested soon after.Police seized approximately HK$1.05 million ($134,370) in cash, over 560 ATM cards, multiple mobile phones, bank documents and records related to crypto transactions.Senior Inspector Tse Ka-lun of Hong Kong’s Commercial Crime Bureau claimed that the individuals often used bank accounts from their friends and family to launder the stolen funds. Hong Kong reported a 12% year-on-year increase in fraud reports in 2024, with authorities making more than 10,000 fraud-related arrests.

2025-05-17T15:21:23.000Z,"A Bitcoiner’s guide to South Africa’s Garden Route","South Africa’s Garden Route, famed for its lush forests, expansive beaches and charming towns, has become a testbed for Bitcoin adoption.From Mossel Bay to Witsand and Plettenberg Bay to Knysna, Bitcoin has become popular among shop owners and travelers alike for a multitude of reasons.“We’re seeing the early signs of a parallel, permissionless economy emerging across an entire region,” James Caw, founder of SimplB — a local crypto asset provider — told Cointelegraph, “where small businesses benefit from faster, lower-cost digital payments and where people have more options to earn, send and receive sound money securely.”For tourists, the benefits are immediate: no currency exchange hassles, no international card fees, and the ability to pay instantly and securely. For locals, Bitcoin (BTC) offers a hedge against inflation, protection from currency volatility and new economic opportunities.Here’s a taste of what a Bitcoin-friendly trip along the Garden Route is like.The Garden Route is where Bitcoin meets paradiseThe Garden Route is one of South Africa’s premier tourist corridors. It stretches roughly 300 kilometers from Mossel Bay in the west to the Storms River Mouth in the east, attracting hundreds of thousands of tourists yearly.Crypto adoption is escalating thanks to South Africa’s regulatory environment, which now recognizes Bitcoin as a financial product. Across the Garden Route, you can spend pre-acquired Bitcoin freely, with little concern for local tax or exchange controls.It’s a grassroots movement. Towns like Witsand and Plettenberg Bay are at the forefront, and national retailers like Pick n Pay provide a safety net for crypto spending along the way. Every Pick n Pay store, including supermarkets, clothing outlets and Express convenience stores, accepts Bitcoin via the CryptoQR app. This guarantees you can always buy daily goods with Bitcoin wherever you travel. Related: Stablecoin fever: 5 major stablecoins are growing crypto adoptionWitsand is the Bitcoin villageLocated at the mouth of the Breede River, Witsand is a sleepy coastal town with a big reputation in the Bitcoin world. Here, Bitcoin isn’t just accepted — it’s preferred.It’s thanks to the efforts of local champions like Edwin Jones, a software engineer and passionate supporter of Bitcoin adoption in the Garden Route. Witsand has become a functioning Bitcoin circular economy. Accommodation options like Fantasea and Happy Days holiday homes, meals at Ellie’s on Main, groceries at local shops, gym memberships, boat services, petrol, surf lessons and mini-golf can be paid for using Bitcoin.As Jones notes: Bitcoin Witsand existed long before we gave it a name. It was just having conversations with friends, and as the local businesses started understanding Bitcoin, they actually demanded we start getting the technology in place.The town’s small and close-knit community has enabled rapid adoption; more than 45 establishments accept Bitcoin as of early 2025. The town’s enthusiasm is infectious, as locals and visitors enjoy the ease and security of digital payments.Witsand proudly announces its acceptance of Bitcoin. Source: Edwin JonesWitsand’s success as a Bitcoin hub is rooted in its community-driven approach. Jones outlines its growth by outlining that: Although there have been many individual businesses over the years since 2009 that started and stopped accepting Bitcoin for the Garden Route, the adoption really started kicking off in 2021.“With the Lightning Network starting to reach maturity around that time, the first Spaza Shop in Mossel Bay, Bitcoin Ekasi, started accepting Bitcoin in August 2021, and the first restaurant in Witsand in December of the same year.”Education has been central to the process. Local advocates have focused on teaching business owners the fundamentals of Bitcoin, warning against scams and emphasizing the difference between Bitcoin and speculative altcoins. “With all the circular economies advocating against gambling and trading, cautioning against interest and investments, being explicitly Bitcoin, and focusing on the fundamentals rather than the price, scammers have been kept at bay,” Jones said. “We have also found that businesses don’t have to adapt as much as evolve.”Bitcoin doesn’t change a business — it just supercharges it. Doing the same old things, much better.Mossel Bay’s surf and social upliftmentMossel Bay, the historical gateway to the Garden Route, is not just about beaches and maritime history. Mossel Bay is home to Bitcoin Ekasi, a pioneering project that brought Bitcoin to the township of JCC Camp.Bitcoin Ekasi empowers unbanked residents by enabling them to earn and spend Bitcoin locally. Coaches at The Surfer Kids nonprofit are paid in Bitcoin, and local spaza shops accept Bitcoin for daily necessities.For the Bitcoiner tourist, Mossel Bay offers a unique opportunity for “conscious crypto-tourism.” You can take surf lessons from instructors paid in Bitcoin, visit the Bitcoin Ekasi education center, or support the project with direct donations.The town also boasts a Pick n Pay that accepts Bitcoin. As SimplB’s Caw observes: The Bitcoin Ekasi project first started when they began accepting Bitcoin because of the demand from foreign tourists visiting Mossel Bay. It is just so simple to function on a Bitcoin standard once you begin using it.Plettenberg Bay is the fastest-growing Bitcoin economyFurther east, Plettenberg Bay has witnessed an explosion in Bitcoin adoption. In just a few months, the number of Bitcoin-accepting merchants jumped from five to more than 75, making it one of Africa’s most dynamic crypto economies.Confirmed acceptors include Ferris Cars (which facilitates rental accommodation payments in crypto), Glow Lighting Design and all local Pick n Pay branches. Adventure tourism companies, boutique retailers and professional services are increasingly receptive to Bitcoin, especially if you ask. The rapid growth suggests an enthusiastic local scene, with businesses eager to tap into the spending power of Bitcoin tourists.Related: 8 major crypto firms announce US expansion this yearPlettenberg Bay offers a vibrant mix of beach life, nature and crypto-friendly commerce. The town’s energy is palpable, and visitors are encouraged to engage with merchants, share information about Lightning payments, and help grow the ecosystem.“Right now Plettenberg Bay is by far the most interesting circular economy in Africa and possibly the world,” said Jones. “It currently boasts having the most businesses accepting Bitcoin of any town in Africa and has achieved this in less than three months.”Bitcoin preferred signs can be found along the Garden Route. Source: Edwin JonesSedgefield is a quiet pioneerSedgefield, a tranquil town between Knysna and Wilderness, played a key role in the national rollout of Bitcoin payments at Pick n Pay. It was one of the trial sites for the innovative QR code converter from MoneyBadger, which enables Bitcoin spending at every Pick n Pay in South Africa.Sedgefield itself doesn’t have the same density of Bitcoin-accepting independent merchants as Witsand or Plettenberg Bay, but the presence of Pick n Pay ensures that crypto tourists can always pay for groceries and essentials with sats.Practical information for your tripIf you do make it out to the Garden Route, recommended wallets include Blink, Wallet of Satoshi and Phoenix — all Lightning-enabled and widely used in the region. In larger towns like Knysna, George, Wilderness and Oudtshoorn, the Bitcoin scene is still emerging. There aren’t yet established circular economies, but the nationwide acceptance of Bitcoin at Pick n Pay provides a reliable foundation for spending.The Spasie on Breede Restaurant and Bar is just one of many establishments accepting Bitcoin. Source: Edwin JonesBTC Map occasionally lists independent merchants, like Beans About Coffee in Oudtshoorn. Still, the best strategy is to ask around, look for Bitcoin signage, and use mapping tools to discover new acceptors.For accommodation, activities and dining, direct inquiry remains key. Many guesthouses and tour operators are open to Bitcoin payments, especially as awareness grows. Online platforms like Bitrefill enable you to buy gift vouchers for major retailers using Bitcoin, providing a workaround for places that don’t yet accept crypto directly.Happy travels.Magazine: Pranksy: Inside the anonymous life of an NFT legend — NFT Collector",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoiners-guide-south-africa-garden-route?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-17T15:00:00.000Z,"The DeFi mullet — Fintech needs DeFi in the back","Opinion by: Merlin Egalite, co-founder at Morpho LabsFintechs in the front, decentralized finance (DeFi) in the back: the DeFi Mullet.Today’s fintech companies offer excellent user experiences but are constrained by traditional financial infrastructure — siloed, slow, expensive and inflexible. Meanwhile, DeFi provides lightning-fast, cost-effective, interoperable infrastructure but lacks mainstream accessibility.The solution? Combine fintech’s distribution and user experience with DeFi’s efficient back end.The mullet is inevitableFintech companies heavily rely on traditional financial (TradFi) infrastructure that is siloed, slow to deploy and run, and costly to maintain. This inefficiency limits their control over costs and product offerings and has potential infrastructure risks. Fintechs have a strong incentive to transition to building on autonomous, credibly neutral public infrastructure.The power of DeFi is evident in stablecoins. While traditional international wire transfers cost $30–$50 and take one to five business days, stablecoin transfers cost mere cents and settle in seconds. This revolutionary improvement in financial infrastructure extends beyond payments. DeFi provides 24/7/365 infrastructure for trading, lending and borrowing with instant settlement, open access and deep liquidity, enabling better price execution and yields.Plugging their compliance-ready front end into DeFi infrastructure, fintech companies can focus on creating exceptional user experiences. This opens up tremendous opportunities for innovation while driving more liquidity onchain, creating a positive feedback loop of embracing the DeFi Mullet.Now is the time for mainstream adoptionToday’s DeFi ecosystem has proven its reliability for fintech integration. There are dozens of protocols that demonstrate this maturity, securely managing billions in loans through immutable, governance-minimized designs. DeFi infrastructure gives fintechs complete control over their infrastructure. This is particularly crucial after the recent Synapse bankruptcy that trapped Yotta user funds meant to be insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.Recent: Bitcoin DeFi will have 300M users, beating Ethereum and Solana: ExecInstitutions are also coming onchain. BlackRock has tokenized a fund via Securitize; Stripe has acquired Bridge for $1 billion to scale its stablecoin solutions; the US is creating a strategic Bitcoin (BTC) reserve; and clarity on regulation is opening the floodgates. The shift is step-by-step but tangible.DeFi has arrived.The next phaseFor years to come, expect more products like crypto-backed loans to be released by fintech’s most advanced players, offering onchain saving accounts, onchain loans, instant international payments and more. This transformation will be invisible to users and powered by smart wallets and account abstraction that maintain the familiar Web2-like user experience at which fintech companies excel. Early adopters will gain significant advantages over competitors.Yet, unlike building on traditional finance, DeFi’s open infrastructure means even latecomers can benefit from existing network effects without starting from zero.Some skeptics argue that the involvement of fintechs and traditional institutions will erode decentralization, as protocols must comply with regulatory requirements. While this concern is understandable, the opposite is more likely.Expecting protocols to achieve compliance across every jurisdiction worldwide is unrealistic, especially given the vast regulatory fragmentation. Instead, regulating the apps that interface with users makes far more sense rather than the underlying protocols. For this regulatory model to work, however, protocols must remain credibly neutral.A credibly neutral mechanism adheres to four principles:It embeds no preference for specific individuals or outcomes.It is open-source with publicly verifiable execution.It is simple and understandable.It changes infrequently.Examples like HTTP and SMTP demonstrate the power of credibly neutral protocols — they are free, open and unregulated, with only the clients subject to oversight. The same logic should apply to governance-minimized, immutable DeFi protocols.These constraints will push DeFi builders toward creating genuinely decentralized and trustless systems.Fintechs integrating DeFi protocols can build on top of the most neutral infrastructure and access their growing network effects.Let the mullet growThe DeFi mullet is more than just a meme — it’s a structural shift.To scale, DeFi must meet users where they are: through regulated, user-friendly fintech channels. For fintechs to stay relevant, they must offer their customers the best user experience and opportunities, such as the best rates. Those who miss this opportunity risk falling into irrelevance, much like traditional retail banks losing market share to today’s fintechs.This convergence isn’t just possible — it’s inevitable.Opinion by: Merlin Egalite, co-founder at Morpho Labs.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-17T12:09:46.000Z,"Bitcoin to $250K in 2025 ‘totally possible’ — crypto analyst Scott Melker","Bitcoin’s next explosive move could send the asset to $250,000 by the end of 2025, according to Scott Melker, a crypto analyst and host of The Wolf of All Streets podcast.Speaking in a recent interview, Melker cited growing institutional interest and diminishing volatility as key factors that could drive the next leg up.“250K this year, totally possible,” Melker said, adding that Bitcoin (BTC)’s volatility has declined significantly in recent years.“It used to be about three times as volatile as the S&P. Now it’s less than two times.” He pointed to increased involvement from pension funds and ETF issuers as evidence of a more mature, stable market.The shift, he argued, reflects a broader trend of institutional adoption. “The more institutional money, the more Wall Street money, the more long-term holders get involved, the less volatility there’s going to be,” Melker explained.Related: New Bitcoin price all-time highs could occur in MayCrypto markets show signs of strength in 2025Market activity in 2025 has already shown signs of strength. Bitcoin surged past $104,000, while Ether (ETH) reclaimed levels above $2,600.Coinbase’s addition to the S&P 500 marked a major milestone for crypto’s integration into mainstream finance. Melker noted the company is not just entering the index but doing so in the top 50 by market cap — a reflection of how deeply rooted some crypto firms have become.In addition to Coinbase, firms like Galaxy Digital and eToro have moved forward with public listings, signaling confidence in regulatory conditions under the current US administration.Melker said that this environment, bolstered by dropped SEC lawsuits and favorable executive orders, has created what he calls “an extremely bullish” backdrop for the sector.While Bitcoin remains the primary focus, Melker acknowledged a renewed interest in altcoins. Recent price action saw Ethereum outpace Bitcoin, triggering a rally across smaller-cap tokens — a sign, he said, that “new money” is entering the space rather than just rotating within it.Related: Here is why Bitcoin price is stuck below $105KDon’t rule out a wild runDespite the optimism, Melker tempered expectations, noting that most experts are forecasting cycle highs between $120,000 and $150,000.

2025-05-17T09:12:28.000Z,"Everstake defends non-custodial staking as SEC weighs industry input","The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has held discussions with Everstake, one of the largest non-custodial staking providers globally, to explore clearer regulatory definitions around staking in blockchain networks.The meeting, which also involved the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, comes at a time when over $193 billion in digital assets are staked across major proof-of-stake (PoS) networks.However, despite the massive scale of participation, staking remains in a legal gray zone in the US as regulators wrestle with its classification under existing securities law.The previous SEC administration also took enforcement actions against major players such as Kraken, Coinbase, and Consensys due to their staking services. The agency, under pro-crypto President Donald Trump, has recently dismissed these enforcement actions.During the meeting, Everstake told the SEC that non-custodial staking should not be classified as a securities transaction. The company said that users maintain full control over their digital assets throughout the staking process and do not transfer ownership to a third party.They argued that this makes staking a technical function, not an investment product.“Our main assertion is that staking is not a financial instrument or security transaction, but rather a technical process, a base-layer protocol mechanism—akin to an oracle in a database—that maintains the integrity and functionality of decentralized networks,” Everstake founder Sergii Vasylchuk told Cointelegraph.Everstake team meeting with the SEC. Source: EverstakeRelated: SEC delays staking decision for Grayscale ETH ETFsEverstake calls for regulatory clarityIn a letter submitted to the SEC’s Crypto Task Force on April 8, 2025, Everstake asked the agency to extend regulatory clarity to non-custodial staking and custodial and liquid staking models.In the letter, which came in respond to Commissioner Hester Peirce’s call for input on regulatory treatment of blockchain services, Everstake argued that non-custodial staking should not be considered a securities offering.It claimed that non-custodial staking, where users retain control of their tokens, does not involve the pooling of assets or the expectation of profits from managerial efforts.In its model, Everstake said users delegate only validation rights while maintaining ownership of their digital assets. The staking rewards are algorithmically distributed by the blockchain network itself, and the firm merely provides technical infrastructure.Related: Ethereum ETF staking will have little impact without multimonth rally: AnalystNon-custodial staking fails the Howey testThe letter also details why non-custodial staking fails each prong of the Howey test. Users do not make an investment of money in a common enterprise, do not expect profits from Everstake’s efforts, and are not dependent on the company’s management for financial returns.Instead, any rewards come from network-level incentives and fluctuate with the market value of the underlying asset.Everstake proposes specific criteria that should exempt non-custodial staking from securities classification. These include user asset control, absence of pooled funds, permissionless unstaking, and the provision of purely technical services.It likens non-custodial staking to proof-of-work mining, which the SEC has previously ruled out as a securities transaction.Margaret Rosenfeld, Everstake’s chief legal officer, also told Cointelegraph that “with non-custodial staking, there’s no handover of assets, no investment contract, and no third-party risk.” She added:“Treating it as a securities offering undermines the decentralized model and risks chilling innovation in the blockchain sector.”Nevertheless, the SEC has so far withheld a definitive stance.

2025-05-17T00:57:29.000Z,"Bitcoin bull flag and standard profit taking hint at eventual rally to new BTC price highs","Key takeaways: Traders expect a Bitcoin price pullback to $90,000, but a bull flag could break out to new highs if profit taking near the range highs reduces. On-chain data suggests the current profit taking is too weak to extinguish Bitcoin’s current price momentum. Bitcoin (BTC) price has spent the bulk of the week pinned below $104,000 to $105,000, which many analysts have labelled as a resistance zone, but an alternative view suggests that BTC is simply consolidating within a bull flag. A bull flag is a continuation pattern that is characterized by a period of sideways price action following a sharp uptrend, and when the structure confirms or breaks from the trendline resistance, the uptrend continues. BTC/USDT 1-day chart. Source: TRDR.ioWhile the range-bound trading portion of the flag is said to represent indecision from buyers and sellers, in this scenario, the absence of buy volume is the primary culprit. As shown in the TRDR.io chart below, Bitcoin’s explosive move to $105,900 from $74,400 was accompanied by large liquidations in the margin markets and robust spot volumes, which aligned with several days of billion-dollar spot BTC ETF inflows. BTC/USDT 1hr chart. Source: TRDR.ioDuring this three-week period, several US-based and international companies also announced plans to purchase Bitcoin and establish BTC treasuries. The spot and futures cumulative volume delta, along with the open interest metric on the chart show traders selling near the range highs and the absence of new long leverage and significantly sized spot positions being opened in this area, whereas drops to range low (bull flag support) sees bids filled on the spot side, but there is still limited use of margin for fresh longs. BTC/USD spot and margin CVD. Source: TRDR.ioBitcoin’s recent cool-down phase is a normal outcome after the near 40% recovery that started on April 8, and the loss of upward momentum resulting from profit-taking in futures markets near the current range high is also to be expected. Bitcoin short-term holder supply profit and loss data from Glassnode supports this view, as shown in the chart below. The onchain data company highlighted profit taking for short-term traders but explained that it does not exceed the statistical norm, leaving room for further price upside. “Recently, the magnitude of STH Realized Profit has surged to almost +3 standard deviations above its 90-day average, reflecting a notable uptick in profit realization. In past cycles, particularly during rallies towards the ATH, this metric has historically climbed to over +5 standard deviations of more.

This has additional benefits for data transmission in space, Belcher said.“The architecture is well-suited to space because it reduces delays, compensates for data corruption caused by radiation, and enables cryptographic verification to ensure data has not been tampered with,” she said.The foundation is a nonprofit governing the decentralized cloud storage protocol Filecoin (FIL), which uses the IPFS web protocol to store data. Lockheed Martin is one of the world’s largest aerospace companies.Source: Filecoin FoundationDecentralized storage benefits“There’s a multi-second delay from the Moon and a multi-minute delay from Mars,” Belcher said.“With IPFS, you look for a content ID and retrieve the data from wherever is closest — your own device, a nearby satellite, or a lunar station.”Additionally, the IPFS uses a distributed architecture to store multiple copies of data across a global network, reducing reliance on centralized data centers.These multiple copies of data improve reliability in environments where hardware is prone to degradation, helping to ensure the integrity of sensitive materials such as satellite images, according to Belcher.Interest in decentralized archival storage is growing among media companies, and the Foundation is also exploring potential military applications of this technology, Belcher said.“It could be really powerful for media in general to have that deep archive and also the ability to have your records everywhere all over the world when needed,” she said.The FIL token is a utility token that can be used within the Filecoin ecosystem.

Crypto analyst Javon Marks noted a breakout that could rival the explosive 2017 bull run. In a recent post on X, Marks highlighted a chart comparing the TOTAL3 index (total market cap of altcoins excluding Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum) against the US money supply, suggesting that altcoins may be on the verge of a significant rally. A rise in TOTAL3 against the US money supply suggests that altcoins are gaining value relative to the total liquidity in the US economy, reflecting increased investor interest and capital inflow into altcoins. TOTAL3/US Money supply.

Comparing 2021 and 2025, the chart mirrors the 2021 altcoin season when top altcoins surged 174% against Bitcoin’s 20% during the final leg.

Blumenthal. Source: Zach WitkoffBlumenthal, the ranking member of the US Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, was one of many Democrats calling for investigations and legislative changes in response to Trump’s ties to WLFI, as well as his TRUMP memecoin and its dinner scheduled for the top tokenholders on May 22. The GENIUS Act, a bill to recognize stablecoins as payment instruments currently being considered in Congress, may be a bellwether for how lawmakers intend to handle the president’s potential conflicts of interest.Stablecoin bill debate continues in Republican-controlled CongressOne of Blumenthal’s and many US lawmakers’ concerns about Trump’s connection to WLFI is the USD1 stablecoin, which the platform launched in March. An Abu Dhabi-based investment firm announced in May that it would use the stablecoin to settle a $2-billion investment in Binance, a crypto exchange that had previously been the target of an investigation by US authorities. “WLFI’s financial entanglements with the President, his family, and the Trump Administration present unprecedented conflicts of interest and national security risks, including potential violations of the foreign emoluments clause,” Blumenthal wrote in a May 6 letter to Witkoff. Related: What are the next steps for the US stablecoin bill?Some Democrats have called for clarification within the GENIUS Act to ensure that Trump was not able to personally profit from stablecoins whose legislation he may have influenced and then have the opportunity to sign into law. However, as of May 16, it was unclear whether any future vote on the bill would address these concerns. Cointelegraph reached out to Sen.
