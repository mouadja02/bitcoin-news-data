2025-05-19T13:54:36.000Z,"Strategy stock rallies despite class action lawsuit","Strategy (NASDAQ: MSTR ) stock climbed $4,78 (1,20%) from its latest closing price of $399.80 to its Monday price of $404,58 as the company revealed that a class-action lawsuit is targeting it. Strategy has acquired 7,390 BTC for ~$764.9 million at ~$103,498 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 16.3% YTD 2025. As of 5/18/2025, we hodl 576,230 $BTC acquired for ~$40.18 billion at ~$69,726 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRK $STRF https://t.co/QwYKgLkfPX — Michael Saylor (@saylor) May 19, 2025 Although most investors became aware of the legal action while reading the firm’s latest Bitcoin purchase disclosure, the company running the lawsuit, Pomerantz, disclosed and detailed it on Sunday, May 18. Some MSTR shareholders are displeased with the firm’s accounting practices and feel they have suffered losses as a result of improper risk statements: Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) the anticipated profitability of the Company’s bitcoin-focused investment strategy and treasury operations was overstated; (ii) the various risks associated with bitcoin’s volatility and the magnitude of losses Strategy could recognize on the value of its digital assets following its adoption of ASU 2023-08 were understated; and (iii) as a result, Defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. The lawsuit also heavily relies on the newly adopted ‘Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-08, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other—Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60): Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets (“ASU 2023-08”).’ In summary, suing investors allege that Michael Saylor’s company offered severely misleading data on the performance of its Bitcoin ( BTC ) strategy. According to Pomerantz’s press release, the inciting incident was the April 7, 2025, $5.91 billion loss disclosure that triggered a rapid 8.67% MSTR stock price drop. While it is not known at press time how much money the plaintiffs are demanding, Strategy expressed its intent to fight vigorously. Why MSTR investors are yet to price in the lawsuit Elsewhere, it is doubtful if MSTR investors have priced in the class action lawsuit. To begin with, following an initial 2% drop in the Monday pre-market, the equity entered a rapid rally immediately after the morning bell. What makes the upswing even stranger is that there has been no shortage of adverse economic news in the second half of May. A major cause for investor anxiety came from Moody’s, which downgraded the U.S. credit rating, thus turbocharging the already-rising 30-year treasury yield.

The relatively larger acquisition happened during a bullish week, with an average price above $103,000. Strategy (MSTR) continued its weekly BTC purchases, this time adding 7,390 BTC to its reserves. The company acquired the additional coins as BTC had a turbulent week with a hike to $106,000.

After the latest purchase, MSTR common stock traded at $399.80, down from its recent six-month peak. Strategy shares are down from their recent six-month high, though remaining one of the winners for the past month. | Source: Google Finance The latest announcement also included a recent development for Strategy, reporting on an alleged lawsuit filed with the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The class-action lawsuit against Michael Saylor and associates claims misleading statements on the potential returns for BTC-based investments. The lawsuit covers the April 30, 2024 to April 4, 2025 period, and alleges misleading statements and failure to disclose information on the anticipated profitability of the BTC investment and treasury operations. Despite the purchase announcement, BTC still erased some of its gains over the weekend. The leading coin traded at $102,447, below the average price of Strategy’s purchase for the past week. Despite this, the firm is still in the green with a $69,726 average price per BTC. Strategy achieved its latest purchase after the sale of over $705M in common stock. This week’s purchase is relatively high compared to previous periods, showing BTC bullish momentum translated into demand for MSTR . The rest of the purchase was financed with $59.7M in STRK convertible instruments. After the latest addition to the treasury, Strategy has $18.98B in common stock authorized to issue, and another $20.85B to issue in the form of STRK. With the latest purchase, Strategy has already allocated over $40B to BTC acquisitions at market price, with nearly as much remaining in authorized but not issued common stock or convertible STRK shares. Strategy inspires other companies to keep buying The latest Strategy acquisition coincides with a new announcement from Metaplanet. The Japanese company added another 1,004 BTC to its balance, at an average price of $103,873 per BTC, a higher entry point compared to Strategy. Just like MSTR, Metaplanet stock rallied to $4.39 , close to its higher range for the next few months. Metaplanet also entered the top 10 of the most liquid stocks on the Japanese market, generating new demand by following Strategy’s model. With the latest purchase, Metaplanet holds 7,800 BTC, getting close to its goal for 2025 to acquire 10,000 BTC. In the past week, announcements from corporations aiming to acquire BTC accelerated. Not all potential buyers made good on their promises. A total of 108 public companies hold BTC in their balance, with seven new treasuries added in the past two weeks. Large-scale treasuries now contain 3.33M BTC, one of the biggest reserves with potential long-term holding. Strategy and Metaplanet bought even though ETFs had net outflows in Q1 and a slowly growing balance in Q2.

2025-05-19T13:37:53.000Z,"Bitcoin’s Realized Capitalization Hits Record $906B – Is a Bull Run Brewing?","Bitcoin has set a new milestone in on-chain metrics. Its Realized Capitalization has reached a fresh high of $906.04 billion for the fourth consecutive week. This metric reflects the total value of all unspent Bitcoin transaction outputs (UTXOs) based on their purchase price, and has now surpassed its previous record as BTC continues consolidating around the crucial support of $103,000. Experts say that this trend could set the stage for a historic bull run. Bullish Breakout Ahead? Since the current range-bound phase began on May 8, Bitcoin has absorbed an additional $14.4 billion in new capital, which is a 1.61% increase in Realized Capitalization. According to CryptoQuant’s latest report , this is an indicator of steady investor inflow. It further suggests that once Bitcoin decisively clears the $104,731 resistance level, the next target at $107,757 could come into play, which, in turn, could potentially open the door to a new all-time high. Interestingly, driving much of this capital accumulation are large holders, with the 100-1,000 BTC UTXO value bands increasing their combined holdings by 122,540 BTC over the past 10 days. This figure represented a 2.2% increase. Institutional interest remains uneven, but BlackRock has emerged as the only major ETF to add to its Bitcoin holdings during this period, which has increased its balance by 10,302 BTC (1.66%) to 631,902 BTC, while other funds have either trimmed exposure or held steady. As such, CryptoQuant observed that the upward trend in Realized Capitalization signals market confidence. If the trend continues, it could support further price expansion and potentially catalyze a historic bull run. Bitcoin’s June Explosion Looms Matrixport’s recent market update also echoed a similar trend, as Bitcoin’s surge has found significant backing from multiple positive catalysts. The platform stated that the fading of crucial downside risks, such as US tech sector pressure due to Q1 earnings and concerns over AI-related capex, has reopened the door for asset growth. Strong earnings and renewed commitments from major tech firms have helped restore investor confidence and lifted equities and crypto alike. Political shifts have also played a role, as US President Donald Trump promoted inbound investments and potential policy tailwinds like extended tax cuts and deregulation. Matrixport said that it turned bullish in mid-April, supported by its trend model signaling a reversal into an uptrend. The firm expects a favorable window for risk assets until July, as this period coincides with the Q2 earnings season, the conclusion of the 90-day tariff truce, and peak liquidity conditions. Another key catalyst is the upcoming $5 billion in FTX creditor payouts set for late May, which could flow into crypto markets and boost momentum in June. Combined with steady ETF inflows and stablecoin growth, these factors may sustain Bitcoin’s rally.

Hedera Hashgraph ( HBAR ) dropped to $0.1870, down by almost 20% from its highest level this month and 54% from its highest in November last year. The ongoing HBAR price retreat happened as the crypto market lost momentum. Bitcoin ( BTC ) retreated to $102,000, a day after it hit $107,000 for the first time since January. Third-party data shows that Hedera’s network fundamentals remain strong, with the total value locked in its decentralized finance ecosystem rising by 15% over the last 30 days to $186 million.

You might also like: MOODENG on Ethereum eyes 85% rally as golden cross forms Additional data shows that the supply of stablecoins on Hedera has surged significantly. As shown in the chart below, the supply jumped to $181.2 million on Monday, up from a year-to-date low of $40 million. It stood at $131 million just last Friday. Hedera stablecoin market cap | Source: DeFi Llama A soaring stablecoin supply on a blockchain is generally seen as a positive indicator, suggesting rising on-chain activity. It can also drive higher network revenues as transaction volumes increase. For example, Tron ( TRX ) has become the most profitable chain due to its dominant share of Tether transactions. Decentralized exchange volume on Hedera also climbed, with a more than 80% increase in the past week to $70.4 million. This brought the network’s cumulative DEX volume to $4.58 billion. Another bullish signal is that the funding rate in the futures market has remained positive since April 16. A positive funding rate indicates that traders expect future prices to rise, a generally bullish sentiment. Hedera funding rate | Source: CoinGlass HBAR price technical analysis Hedera price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that HBAR has pulled back in recent sessions. On the positive side, the token remains above the 200-day Exponential Moving Average and the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level. Hedera has also formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern, a popular bullish reversal sign in technical analysis. Therefore, the Hedera price may bounce back in the next few days as the US credit rating downgrade jitters end . If this happens, the initial target to watch will be at $0.2240, the 50% Fibonacci Retracement level. A move below the support at $0.15 will invalidate the bullish outlook.

This was driven by traditional asset holdings like Treasury bills and gold, which cushioned the impact of crypto market volatility. As the US debates stablecoin regulation through bills like the STABLE Act and the GENIUS Act, Tether’s growing influence proves the increasing institutional acceptance of stablecoins. Meanwhile, Tether also recently backed a massive Bitcoin acquisition on behalf of Twenty One Capital by purchasing $458.7 million worth of BTC as the firm prepares for a public listing via a SPAC merger. With backing from SoftBank and Bitfinex, Twenty One now ranks as the third-largest corporate Bitcoin holder and plans to become the top institutional vehicle for Bitcoin exposure. Overall, it is quite clear that Tether is expanding its footprint across traditional and crypto markets. Tether Ranks Among World’s Largest Treasury Holders Tether, the leading stablecoin issuer with over $151 billion in assets, surpassed Germany in United States Treasury bill holdings. According to data from the US Department of the Treasury and Tether’s Q1 2025 attestation report, the firm now holds more than $120 billion in US Treasurys, placing it ahead of Germany’s $111.4 billion and ranking it as the 19th largest holder among all countries and entities. Countries holding US Treasury bills (Source: Treasury.gov ) The attestation report also revealed that Tether generated more than $1 billion in operating profit during the first quarter of 2025. This performance was driven primarily by its holdings in US Treasury bills, which are widely regarded as one of the safest and most liquid investment instruments globally. The firm shared that while the broader crypto market experienced downside volatility in Q1, its traditional asset reserves—including Treasury bills and gold—helped mitigate potential losses. In particular, the gains from gold investments nearly offset the impact of crypto-related fluctuations, which certainly helped confirm the strength of Tether’s asset mix . Tether’s expanding influence comes at a time when stablecoin regulation in the United States is in flux. Growing regulatory clarity could help boost demand for USDT, prompting the company to expand its reserves even more. Two key legislative proposals are at the center of the regulatory conversation. The STABLE Act, which aims to increase transparency and accountability for stablecoin issuers, has advanced through committee and is now awaiting a floor vote in the House. Meanwhile, the GENIUS Act, which focuses on stablecoin collateralization standards and anti-money laundering compliance, has stalled due to political resistance. Despite this, a strong show of support from top crypto founders in Washington, D.C., suggests that regulatory momentum may soon pick back up. US Stablecoin Law Still on Track The push for comprehensive stablecoin regulation in the United States is still going forward despite a recent setback in the Senate. Cody Carbone, CEO of the Digital Chamber, a prominent Washington-based blockchain advocacy group, is still very optimistic about the eventual passage of the GENIUS Act, formally titled the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation in US Stablecoins of 2025. Cody Carbone In an interview at Consensus 2025, Carbone explained that although the bill failed to pass a procedural vote earlier this month, it is only a temporary delay and not a derailment of momentum. According to him, the bill is likely to pass in the coming weeks, especially as Congress already moved faster on this issue than many expected. Carbone also talked about the bipartisan appeal of stablecoin regulation, and argued that protecting the US dollar's global dominance should be a shared goal across party lines. The GENIUS Act is seen as a crucial legislative framework that could shape the future of stablecoin issuance and compliance in the United States. Failing to pass meaningful reform before the 2026 midterm elections could potentially roll back the progress that was made in creating a favorable regulatory environment for digital assets. Despite the procedural hiccup on May 8, negotiations are ongoing, and advocates are hopeful that the revised version of the bill will find the necessary support in the Senate soon. Part of the GENIUS Act (Source: US Senate ) The initial failure of the bill was blamed on partisan disputes and growing controversy surrounding former President Donald Trump’s involvement in the crypto space. Several Democratic senators withdrew their support due to ethical concerns over Trump’s links to meme coins, NFTs, and decentralized finance. Coinbase’s chief legal officer Paul Grewal had similar concerns, and suggested Trump’s digital asset complicated the regulatory debate. In response, Republican Senator Tim Scott accused Democrats of allowing political motivations to obstruct necessary financial innovation. The most recent version of the GENIUS Act reportedly removes references to the Trump family in an attempt to push the legislation through. Industry insiders believe the revised bill could pass by the end of May. Tether Backs Major Bitcoin Play Meanwhile, Tether recently made a large Bitcoin purchase on behalf of Twenty One Capital, a Bitcoin-focused investment firm it backs. Tether bought nearly half a billion dollars' worth of BTC in anticipation of the company’s upcoming public debut. According to a US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing on May 13, Tether purchased 4,812.2 Bitcoin for $458.7 million at an average price of $95,319 per coin. The purchase was transferred into an escrow wallet on May 9, boosting Twenty One’s total Bitcoin holdings to 36,312 BTC. This positioned Twenty One as the third-largest corporate Bitcoin holder globally, behind only Strategy and MARA Holdings. Strategy holds approximately 568,840 BTC, while MARA controls around 48,237 BTC, according to BitcoinTreasuries.net . Once the firm completes its Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) merger with Cantor Equity Partners, it plans to trade under the ticker XXI. The merger is still undergoing regulatory approvals, though CEO Jack Mallers confirmed the process is underway. Tether, along with crypto exchange Bitfinex, holds a majority stake in Twenty One. The merger is being sponsored by Cantor Fitzgerald, a major Wall Street player providing financial advisory services and securing $585 million to help fund the firm’s growing Bitcoin portfolio. Japanese investment conglomerate SoftBank also threw its weight behind the venture by contributing $900 million. Together, Tether, SoftBank, and Bitfinex want to help Twenty One reach a total of 42,000 BTC before to its public listing, with Tether expected to contribute 23,950 BTC, SoftBank 10,500 BTC, and Bitfinex roughly 7,000 BTC in exchange for equity . In an April presentation, Twenty One laid out its ambition to surpass Strategy as the leading Bitcoin investment vehicle. It markets itself as a “pure play” for institutional and retail investors looking for capital-efficient Bitcoin exposure.

An impressive surge in buying over the past two weeks highlights growing investor confidence as this presale nears its close. Recent whale purchases of Solaxy ($SOLX) have totaled over $1M, with a significant $375K investment in a single whale purchase just today, adding to the already $37M+ raised so far. Large-scale buying like this hints $SOLX could be one of the best crypto presales to get into today. But first, what’s the reason for the $SOLX surge? And can it maintain its strong upward trend? Crypto Momentum: $SOLX in the Spotlight A series of significant announcements in the crypto space in recent months have sparked market enthusiasm and notable upticks across the board. For instance, positive shifts in the broader economic landscape, such as easing US-China trade tensions , have created a more favorable environment for digital assets. Major crypto milestones have added to the positive sentiment, including Bitcoin achieving its highest-ever weekly close. A landmark moment for the industry’s integration into the mainstream of finance was crypto company Coinbase’s recent debut in the S&P 500. Furthermore, strong performance from Ethereum has buoyed the altcoin market, all against a backdrop of steadily expanding adoption of digital currencies and tokenized assets. It’s clear these broad market catalysts and crypto achievements have injected new energy into the market.

Solaxy offers a superior secondary platform for developers to build and interact with next-generation dApps seamlessly and cost-effectively. The goal is a faster, more reliable, and limitlessly scalable Solana. $SOLX: Your DeFi & Trading Edge At the center of Solaxy is the $SOLX token, your key to the enhanced ecosystem. This multi-chain token merges Ethereum’s deep liquidity and compatibility with Solana’s lightning speed, a dream for DeFi users and meme coin traders seeking the edge. Solaxy aims to democratize meme coin trading by putting powerful tools into everyday traders’ hands. High-performance Layer 2 infrastructure reduces costs and speeds up transactions. That gives everyday traders a real chance to compete in a market often dominated by whales and sophisticated, automated bots.

2025-05-19T13:03:33.000Z,"Best Presale Crypto List: Nexchain, Solaxy & BTC Bull Token Stand Out","The post Best Presale Crypto List: Nexchain, Solaxy & BTC Bull Token Stand Out appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Presale tokens have become one of the hottest trends in crypto investing, offering early access to promising projects before they hit the mainstream. With the potential for high ROI and early-stage gains, more investors are eyeing these opportunities in 2025. Among the best presale crypto contenders this year, Nexchain leads the pack with real-world utility and powerful AI-backed infrastructure. Meanwhile, Solaxy and BTC Bull Token are also gaining attention for their unique approaches. As the momentum behind new crypto presales grows, these names are topping the list of top crypto presales 2025. Nexchain: Real Utility, Real Hype, Real Returns When it comes to crypto presale opportunities in 2025, Nexchain is in a league of its own. As the first Layer-1 AI-powered blockchain, it combines real-world utility with bleeding-edge tech, setting a new standard for scalability and decentralization. Nexchain boasts an incredible 400,000+ transactions per second (TPS) and ultra-low gas fees, made possible by its hybrid consensus mechanism. What truly sets it apart is its 10% daily gas fee revenue sharing model, which rewards holders with passive income in a way few other presales even attempt. Currently in Stage 12 of its presale, Nexchain has already raised over $2 million, with its token priced at $0.046. Experts are forecasting an expected ROI of 652%, making it one of the most talked-about high ROI crypto assets this year. Backed by a Certik audit and growing investor confidence, Nexchain is rapidly becoming the cornerstone of the best presale crypto lists. It’s no wonder seasoned investors are calling it “the one to watch” in the 2025 presale landscape. The Nexchain presale is more than hype, it’s a signal of serious potential. Solaxy: Green Energy Meets DeFi Solaxy is carving a unique niche in the world of best presale crypto by merging clean energy initiatives with decentralized finance. As climate concerns rise and investors seek purpose-driven assets, Solaxy brings an innovative solution: a blockchain-based ecosystem that rewards users for supporting renewable energy. Its mission is simple yet powerful: leverage DeFi to accelerate the adoption of sustainable practices worldwide. At the heart of Solaxy’s model are carbon credit rewards and a sustainable staking system, allowing users to earn passive income while reducing their carbon footprint. The project also features eco-focused tokenomics, ensuring that each transaction supports environmental projects and encourages long-term holding. For environmentally conscious investors and those exploring upcoming crypto launches with real-world impact, Solaxy offers both profitability and purpose. While Solaxy certainly stands out in the green crypto space, experts still point to Nexchain as the most well-rounded opportunity for long-term gains and mainstream adoption in 2025. It’s the blend of cutting-edge tech and real utility that keeps Nexchain at the top of every serious investor’s watchlist. BTC Bull Token: Meme Meets Market Timing BTC Bull Token is a classic example of a high-risk, high-reward crypto presale. Inspired by Bitcoin’s legendary status, this meme-driven project blends gamified tokenomics with viral branding to capture the attention of retail investors looking for the next breakout. With a rapidly growing online following and buzz on social platforms, BTC Bull Token is gaining traction among those chasing quick gains. Its appeal lies in its community-driven momentum, fun design, and timing as Bitcoin’s price trends upward in 2025. However, it’s important to note that BTC Bull Token leans heavily on hype and lacks the deep technical foundation or long-term use cases seen in more serious projects. As far as best presale crypto opportunities go, it may offer quick returns, but Nexchain remains the clear favorite for investors prioritizing real-world utility, audited security, and lasting impact. Final Thoughts Nexchain stands out among the best presale crypto of 2025 because of its innovative technology and usefulness. Nexchain combines fast transactions, hybrid consensus, and a proven revenue-sharing mechanism, while Solaxy focuses on sustainability, and BTC Bull Token leverages community engagement. These features make Nexchain a notable project to watch in the landscape of current crypto presale opportunities.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/best-presale-crypto-list-nexchain-solaxy-btc-bull-token-stand-out/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Press Release",cryptocompare

The strategy, to be rolled out to institutions and retail users, consisted of two main components: a bitcoin basis trade, involving a long position in the spot market while shorting futures, and a short position in BTC put options, both collateralized by BUIDL tokens. The basis trade, also known as cash and carry arbitrage, alone generated an annualized yield of 4.7%, with put option writing contributing an additional 15%. Combined with the 4.25% return from BUIDL used as collateral, the total yield exceeded 24%. Integrating BUIDL as collateral helped generate a higher return than strategies collateralized by stablecoins, which do not generate any return. \""This strategy allows investors to capture both Treasury Bill yields and funding rate arbitrage returns,\"" Jack Lu, founder and CEO of BounceBit said in a press release exclusively shared with CoinDesk. \""BounceBit bridges the gap between Western real-world asset issuers and Asian crypto trading infrastructure, providing new options for yield generation,\"" Lu said. BounceBit is the native BTC restaking chain secured by staking both bitcoin and BounceBit tokens. The network allows BTC holders to earn yields through native validator staking, DeFi ecosystem and a CeFi-like mechanism powered by Ceffu and Mainnet Digital. As of writing, cryptocurrencies worth over $500 million were locked on BounceBit. BounceBit plans to roll out the BUIDL-collateralised strategy to institutional and retail users soon. \""The successful pilot is a proof of concept to our new product line BB Prime, which will be available to both retail and institutional users,\"" BounceBit's spokesperson told CoinDesk. \""This strategy underpins BB Prime as a new class of CeDeFi applications built on top of RWAs which are traditionally troubled by a lack of utilities beyond just holding for t-bill yield, hindering mass adoption,\"" the spokesperson added. BUIDL, launched in March 2024 by Securitize and BlackRock, is a tokenized investment fund operating on multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Aptos and Polygon.

2025-05-19T12:50:40.000Z,"Crypto bull run intact despite weekend volatility in Bitcoin","Bitcoin saw a classic weekend pump-and-dump, with price now sitting at a critical support level. Despite the drop, the market structure remains bullish and poised for another breakout. Bitcoin ( BTC ) opened the week with a sharp retracement after an unsustainable Sunday rally pushed prices higher. The impulsive sell-off into Monday brought the asset back to a crucial support zone, yet the broader picture remains optimistic. Bitcoin continues to trade within a well-defined bullish channel, and the current correction is retesting key levels that could act as a launchpad for the next leg up. If this zone holds, there’s a strong case for Bitcoin pushing to new all-time highs in the coming days. Key technical points Bitcoin is still respecting its bullish ascending channel, holding higher highs and higher lows. Price is testing a support confluence zone at $102,790, the 0.618 Fibonacci, the VWAP, and the channel low. Bullish structure remains intact, despite the short-term volatility after the weekend spike. BTCUSDT (4H) Chart, Source: TradingView The corrective move seen over the past 24 hours is characteristic of weekend-driven volatility, where thin Sunday volume can lead to exaggerated price swings. While the pullback may seem dramatic on lower timeframes, it has delivered Bitcoin to a significant technical zone with multiple levels of confluence. This makes the current area not just a support level, but a potential accumulation zone. Importantly, the broader market structure remains bullish. Bitcoin continues to form higher highs and higher lows, and the ascending trading channel has held firm through the recent retracement. Holding this support region could establish the foundation for the next bullish rotation. Technically, it’s a high-probability zone for long setups, provided price consolidates and begins forming a base on intraday charts. You might also like: The new web3 paradigm: Why LayerK is built for a post-big tech internet From here, Bitcoin must stabilize above this support confluence and establish a bottoming formation, a typical precursor to renewed momentum. If successful, this would open the door to a move toward the channel’s upper boundary. That upper trendline, which hasn’t been tested during the current move, remains a likely price target if bullish momentum returns. What to expect in the coming price action Bitcoin continues to hold a bullish narrative despite recent weekend volatility. If current support levels remain intact, price is likely to rotate higher and make another attempt at all-time highs this week. A brief period of consolidation at these levels could represent the calm before the next breakout.

Metaplanet Buys 1,004 More Bitcoins for $104 Million, Bringing Total Assets Near $806 Million The company announced on Monday that the latest purchase, valued at $104.3 million, was made at an average price of $103,873 per bitcoin.

At current market prices — with Bitcoin trading at $103,343, according to The Block’s price page — Metaplanet’s BTC stash is currently worth around $806 million. Often referred to as the “MicroStrategy of Asia” due to its Bitcoin-heavy corporate strategy, Metaplanet began accumulating BTC in April 2024 and has been steadily increasing its purchases in pursuit of its goal of 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025. The Tokyo-listed firm has primarily funded its bitcoin purchases through a series of bond issues. The $15 million bond issue announced last week was its 15th since launching the crypto-focused strategy.

Strategy chairman Michael Saylor, president and CEO Phong Le and executive vice president and chief financial officer Andrew Kang are all defendants in the suit. Strategy officials are accused of “violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act.” The filing states: “The [suit claims] that the named defendants made false and/or misleading statements with respect to and/or failed to disclose information with respect to the anticipated profitability of our Bitcoin-focused investment strategy and treasury operations, and the various risks associated with bitcoin’s volatility.“ 0xngmi, a pseudonymous developer at decentralized finance data platform DefiLlama, wrote in a May 19 X post that he believes the lawsuit has no basis. He explained that the suit “seems to be people complaining that [Strategy] understated how much money it could lose if BTC went down.” Still, he argued that the risks were not understated: “You’re buying a company that is self-labelled as “leverage on Bitcoin,” what do you expect?” Source: 0xngmi Related: Strategy will beat all public equities with Bitcoin, analyst says Corporate Bitcoin treasury trend grows Strategy’s Bitcoin treasury strategy has inspired other companies to follow in its footsteps.

2025-05-19T12:38:24.000Z,"Never sell your Bitcoin — unless you’re Willy Woo? Crypto X purists pounce on influencer for strategy","Most people on crypto X are familiar with the “Never sell your Bitcoin” maxim. However, on May 13, one of the prominent Bitcoin influencers, trader and investor Willy Woo, admitted he is selling his holdings to invest in Bitcoin infrastructure instead. The post sparked debates and was booed by many in the crypto community. However, Woo presented some rationale in defense of his decision. Woo isn’t bearish on Bitcoin Willy Woo is far from being somewhat bearish on Bitcoin. Just a week before publicly claiming that he was getting rid of his BTC, he predicted that Bitcoin dominance would surpass 90% in the next 15 years. Woo has been an avid Bitcoin trader and market expert for many years. His revelation about selling BTC to invest in Bitcoin infrastructure companies came up totally unprovoked. He just replied to the tweet of a popular X account The Bitcoin Therapist, who calls everyone who is selling bitcoins “retards” more or less on a daily basis. Replying to one such post, Woo admitted that he had actually just sold some of his BTC to a contractor doing some work for him, adding, “This is how BTC wins. Adoption.” When the Bitcoin Therapist referred to this as a charitable donation, Woo said that he is getting rid of all his BTC now, “Buying BTC infrastructure companies with it.” TBH I’m in the process of getting rid of all my BTC. Buying BTC infrastructure companies with it. But to your point there was a time when BTC was climbing by 30% per week and OGs were giving away 5BTC at a time via faucets in order to support the network with new users. — Willy Woo (@woonomic) May 14, 2025 To explain his decision, Woo provided an example of himself investing in Exodus Wallet in 2016. According to Woo, the profits made from this investment are 2.5 times bigger now than the profits from the Bitcoin investment made at that time. He noted that nowadays, Bitcoin startups have Bitcoin treasuries, and if the startup itself turns out to be a failure, the BTC treasury may mitigate the risks. However, in the event of a startup’s success, it is possible to gain much more than by investing solely in Bitcoin. Excuse my language but you would have to be fucking retarded to sell your bitcoin right now. — The ₿itcoin Therapist (@TheBTCTherapist) May 13, 2025 Although Woo presented his vision, few to no people on X found it convincing. In the comment section, people referred to it as a mistake; some expressed suspicion that Woo is probably hinting at a soon-to-come correction. When the Bitcoin Therapist posted a screenshot of Woo’s revelation, captioning it “Legendary trader Willy Woo, says he’s selling his Bitcoin to buy infrastructure companies,” many people questioned the “legendary” status itself, called Woo names, or dismissed Woo, saying that he is “not the same” after mistakes he has been doing since 2021. Generally, a screenshot of his post taken out of context was ridiculed and received severe backlash. LOL. Selling the actual infrastructure — the literal foundation of everything — to buy “infrastructure companies” Everyone of these infra & treasuries companies will be buying Bitcoin. https://t.co/AXkk8tD8Pl — Sina 🗝️⚡ 21st Capital (@Sina_21st) May 14, 2025 However, a rare voice of support, product builder Dan Sanchez, replied to the screenshot, noting that he has been paying people with BTC and, although he may have missed huge returns because of this, “the bigger incentive is making an impact on people that provide real value.” I've spent a lot of my Bitcoin on domains, projects, logos, people, data, and other resources. Does it freak me out that I could have WAY more liquidity than I do now? Sure does. The bigger incentive is making an impact on people that provide real value, so that they themselves… — Dan Sanchez (BitcoinMedia.com) 🟠 (@DanSanchez) May 14, 2025 In December 2024, it was reported that Willy Woo invested in Debifi, a noncustodial platform facilitating Bitcoin-backed lending. Woo sees the platform not just as a lending platform but rather as a tool that allows long-term holders to borrow more funds without having to sell their holdings. David Bailey vs subscribers Just hours after the fuss surrounding Woo’s alleged Bitcoin sale, David Bailey of Bitcoin Magazine and Nakamoto, a new company following the steps of Strategy, got in an argument with his subscribers on X. The dispute erupted as Bailey asked what’s wrong with selling bitcoins to buy back discounted shares of his company, Nakamoto (NAV). Read more: Michael Saylor Asserts MicroStrategy Will Never Sell Its Bitcoin There were various responses, with commenters not only showcasing a strong “Never sell Bitcoin” stance but also emphasizing that selling Bitcoin would send the market a signal that won’t land well for Nakamoto. For instance, it can be a signal that the company’s trust in Bitcoin is weak, which is not a good look for a company built around the idea of relentless Bitcoin accumulation. Another argument against trading Bitcoin is that it may signal weakness of the NAV shares themselves. If a company is trading below 1 NAV the market is likely worried about future default risk / too much leverage. So selling bitcoin to buy back shares would shrink the asset base, leave liabilities unchanged, and increase the company’s leverage ratio further. — Joe Burnett, MSBA (@IIICapital) May 14, 2025 Bailey didn’t agree with anyone. He posted another tweet, guessing that people in the comment section simply cannot distinguish arbitrating from selling, adding, “I feel like I’m taking crazy pills reading these comments, lol.” This is going to sound crazy but the biggest issue with a Bitcoin Treasury Co selling btc will be the psychological factor that a BTC Co is actually selling Bitcoin. — TO (@TheOneNotChosen) May 14, 2025 Plan B’s case Plan B is a prominent Bitcoin influencer and popularizer of adopting the Stock-to-Flow model for Bitcoin price analysis. Plan B made headlines in February when he revealed that he is moving his Bitcoin holdings to ETFs to reach “peace of mind” and avoid problems with private key management. ⚠️ Disclosure ⚠️ I have transferred my bitcoin to ETFs. Yes I know, not your keys not your coins. But it is just easier for me to manage bitcoin the same way as equities and bonds. Also, not having to hassle with keys gives me peace of mind. I guess I am not a maxi anymore. — PlanB (@100trillionUSD) February 15, 2025 The move triggered much criticism, both from Bitcoin maxis and Bitcoin skeptics. As for the latter, economist Peter Schiff referred to Plan B’s switch to ETFs as “another example of Bitcoin not fulfilling its supposed purpose.” Bitcoiners criticized Plan B for entrusting control over his funds to a third party. That’s not about being a maxi or not… It’s about the individual decision of having an asset in your control or not. Do you trust yourself or do you trust someone else? — Dan Held (@danheld) February 15, 2025 Just like in the case of Bailey and Woo, selling Bitcoin, no matter for what purpose, is met with dismay and disapproval. So, never sell your Bitcoin. Or, perhaps, sell it in secret.

No company has leaned harder into crypto than this one – making it one of the largest corporate Bitcoin holders. At the heart of it all is Michael Saylor. Come what may – praise or harsh criticism, Saylor doesn’t budge from his belief that Bitcoin is “digital gold”. “My formula for success is rise early, work late, and buy Bitcoin,” But lately, that no-brakes approach is starting to raise more than just eyebrows. A fresh lawsuit is now questioning whether the company’s obsession with Bitcoin might be more reckless than revolutionary. And just when you think they’d pull back, they double down with another massive BTC buy. What is going on? Investors Push Back: Strategy Slapped With Class Action Lawsuit MicroStrategy (MSTR) is staring down a class action lawsuit filed in the Eastern District of Virginia . The case, led by Pomerantz LLP , targets the firm and key executives for allegedly misleading investors over the financial impact of new Bitcoin accounting rules. What is this all about? ASU 2023-08 , a standard requiring companies to reflect Bitcoin’s market value on their balance sheets. According to the suit, Strategy failed to adequately warn investors of the potential $5.91 billion fair-value loss under the updated rules. The complaint also accuses the company of sugarcoating reality through made-up metrics like “BTC Yield” and “BTC $ Gain,” painting a far rosier picture of profitability than GAAP numbers would support. It didn’t go unnoticed. On April 7 , after the $5.9B bombshell surfaced, MSTR stock dropped 8.67% . By May 1 , earnings confirmed the dent – and investors weren’t amused. And that’s when things came crumbling down. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Price Prediction This Week: Will BTC Break Past $106K or Pull Back? , Meanwhile, Another Bitcoin Buy? If you thought the lawsuit might slow Strategy down, think again. According to a May 19 filing, the company has snapped up another 7,390 BTC – worth $764.9 million – at an average price of $103,498 per coin. The purchase was funded through an ATM equity offering and newly issued Series A STRK preferred stock . That brings Strategy’s total stash to 576,230 BTC , now valued around $59 billion , with a new average cost basis of $69,726 . A Strategy Set in Stone Here’s what’s odd: a high-stakes lawsuit, billions in reported losses, and yet – business as usual. There’s no sign of a pivot. No course correction. Love it or hate it, Strategy does not seem to be backing down. Will it be the key to their success or the first domino of their downfall?

The cryptocurrency market capitalization decreased by 3.3% over the last 24 hours, now standing at $3.36 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $141 billion at the time of writing. TLDR: The market has seen drops across the board: liquidations pushing it down, ETF inflows pulling it up; BTC briefly hit the weekly high of $106,518, before pulling back to $103,011; Bitcoin may surge to $136,000 soon; Spot ETFs continue to see investor interest, hitting weekly net inflows of $608.4 million; Analysts expect a short-term pullback, driven by short-term liquidations; While the dip seems unstainable, negative news or regulations may prolong it. Why Is Crypto Down Today – May 19, 2025: Crypto Winners & Losers Not a single coin among the top 10 coins per market cap has seen its price increase today. Ethereum (ETH) recorded the highest loss.

Source: Coinglass Bitcoin May Surge to $136,000 Soon John Glover, Chief Investment Officer at crypto lending platform Ledn and former Barclays managing director, says he expects to see a short-lived Bitcoin correction before the next leg higher towards $136,000. “The BTC price action is tracking the projected line nicely,” Glover says. He expects a short-lived correction into the mid-$80,000 region to complete wave (ii) of Wave 5. Once that wave is done, the next impulsive move would be higher to target $120,000, with the ultimate target of $136,000 later in the year or early next year “to complete Wave 5 (orange line) of the bull run.” Per Glover, “keep in mind that wave (i) can be completely retraced by wave (ii), so a retest of the $74,5000 low of Wave IV is not out of the question. But my expectations continue to be for a rally to $133,000-$136,000 into the end of this year/beginning of next.” Source: John Glover, Ledn Meanwhile, Adam Back, CEO of blockchain tech company Blockstream , recently argued that BTC is significantly undervalued and could hit $1 million per coin during the current market cycle. He said that the four-year cycle in BTC’s price action stretches with time and that we’re early in this cycle. “I’m thinking this cycle could get quite high $500,000 to $1 million, because there’s a lot going on.” The catalysts include the US approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and crypto-friendly political approach in that country, Back said. BULLISH: Adam Back says \""$100,000 is way too cheap\"" and that Bitcoin gets between \""$500,000 and $1 Million during this cycle.\"" pic.twitter.com/7oy5haOTbn — Simply Bitcoin (@SimplyBitcoinTV) April 24, 2025 Levels & Events to Watch Next Bitcoin posted its previous weekly high in December 2024 when the price surpassed $104,400. The coin is currently hovering around $103,000, signaling a short-term weakness. Nonetheless, a drop below the psychological level of $100,000 and the technical level of $98,000 could lead to further downside. According to the latest Glassnode report, a key accumulation zone has been between $93,000 and $95,000. This zone will likely act as a strong support level in case of a short-term market pullback such as this one. It will be “a demand zone where investors are likely to see value once again.” Source: Glassnode Moreover, the Fear and Greed Index has stood at 71 for several days now. While it may indicate a rise in optimism and buying activity, the downside is that it may also suggest overconfidence and overvaluation. That said, the price is still supported by consistent spot ETF inflows and major macro factors. Inflation, tariff deals, and other economic factors are turning investor interest towards safe assets, including digital assets. For the week ending 16 May, US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs saw net inflows totaling $608.4 million, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) leading the pack. Furthermore, Metaplanet has purchased an additional 1,004 BTC on Monday. This is Asia’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder, and the purchase is part of its Bitcoin accumulation strategy. This acquisition has increased its total holdings to 7,800 BTC. The purchase comes days after the company reported record-breaking earnings for the first quarter of 2025. *Metaplanet Acquires Additional 1,004 $BTC * pic.twitter.com/r86rLc7ngh — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) May 19, 2025 Quick FAQ Why did crypto move against stocks today? The broader crypto market has seen notable volatility and downward pressure today due to high leverage and liquidations. On the other hand, the US stock markets posted gains due to the increase in investor and macro optimism. For example, the S&P 500 is up 0.7% today, the Nasdaq-100 has increased by 0.43%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up by 0.78%. Is this dip sustainable? The current sell-off may be unsustainable, given the consistent institutional interest. The dip is likely a pullback triggered by liquidations across long and short positions. However, negative news or regulatory shifts, combined with the volatility, may trigger an additional correction.

The rebound was led by U.S.-based investors, who contributed $681 million, followed by $86.3 million from Germany and $24.2 million from Hong Kong. The latter saw its largest inflow since November 2024, according to CoinShares’ latest Digital Asset Fund flows report. Bitcoin BTC products attracted the lion’s share of last week’s inflows at $557 million. That’s a step down from the previous week and comes as the U.S. Federal Reserve continues to signal a hawkish stance, possibly tempering investor enthusiasm. The recovery is visible for U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETFs specifically. After recording $3.56 billion outflows in February and $767 million in March, nearly $3 billion came in last month. So far in May, these funds brought in $2.64 billion, according to SoSoValue data. Short bitcoin products saw their fourth consecutive week of inflows, suggesting some investors are hedging their bets or positioning for downside moves. When it comes to altcoins, ether ETH products stood out. These brought in $205 million in inflow, the highest since March. That recovery was seemingly linked to the successful Pectra upgrade. Only products invested in Solana SOL recorded net outflows among the top investment vehicles, losing just under $1 million for the week.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/19/crypto-investment-products-fully-recover-from-7b-outflows-seen-in-february-march,"ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL","Markets|Crypto Investment|Bitcoin ETF|Bitcoin|News",cryptocompare

Bitcoin ( BTC ) fell to $102,870 after trading near the $106,000 level on Sunday. Ethereum ( ETH ) declined to $2,400, while the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies dropped by 1.67% to $3.25 trillion.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana prices chart | Source: crypto.news Bitcoin and crypto prices fell after Moody’s US downgrade Stocks and crypto fell as investors reacted to Moody’s decision to downgrade the US credit rating . In a statement on Friday, the agency warned that the country’s fiscal outlook was deteriorating. The US Debt Clock shows the national debt has risen to over $36.8 trillion, up from $21 trillion in 2020. That figure is expected to rise further following a new agreement in the House on the so-called Big, Beautiful Bill. You might also like: Bitcoin’s institutionalization puts brakes on wild rallies, analyst says The bill includes tax cuts estimated to cost between $4.5 trillion and $5 trillion over the next decade, partially offset by projected spending cuts of $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion. Historically, markets have reacted negatively to credit rating downgrades of major economies. Stocks and cryptocurrencies declined on August 1, 2023, when Fitch downgraded the U.S. from AAA to AA+. A similar move occurred on August 5–6, 2011, when S&P Global made the same downgrade. Some analysts, however, downplayed the impact of Moody’s decision. In a post on X, Jim Bianco called the downgrade a “nothingburger.” Why the Moody’s downgrade of the US SHOULD BE a nothingburger —- In August 2011, S&P went first and downgraded the US from AAA to AA+. All hell broke loose. The reason hell broke loose was a lot of derivative contract, loan agreements, investment directives and the like… https://t.co/YLq29uKcyZ — Jim Bianco (@biancoresearch) May 16, 2025 In theory, the deteriorating US public finances is a bullish catalyst for Bitcoin, an asset that is slowly becoming a safe-haven asset. In a lengthy white-paper , BlackRock argued that Bitcoin was becoming a good asset to hedge against the soaring US debt and the rising risk of a default. BlackRock noted that Bitcoin was a “scarce, non-sovereign, decentralized asset with a limited supply.” Since that paper’s release, Bitcoin’s fundamentals have improved. Supply on exchanges and in over-the-counter markets has dropped to multi-year lows, while demand via exchange-traded funds has surged. Cumulative inflows into spot Bitcoin funds have surpassed $41 billion. More companies are also adding Bitcoin to their treasuries. Therefore, Bitcoin and crypto prices will likely bounce back from this panic. For example, most altcoins have rallied in the past few weeks as the Liberation Day tariffs fears eased.

The price surged and reached the crucial resistance levels, not seen since February but failed to surpass the range, resulting in a notable pullback. Previously, the rejection from the range had dragged the levels towards the lows below $1400. So the question arises whether the ETH price will revive a strong upswing to $3000. Regardless of the long-term price action, the ETH price is poised for a strong upswing in the short term as the 50/200-day MAs have undergone a golden cross. However, in the long term, the price is expected to face some upward pressure as the token has dropped below a crucial resistance zone. Previously, a strong buying volume followed this rejection, which pushed the price to $4000. The ETH price has witnessed its strongest 1-month rise in recent times after the rebound it underwent on April 7, 2025. Meanwhile, the price faced extreme upward pressure last week, which stopped the rally and got rejected exactly at the 50-day weekly MA. This rebound is technically the new bullish leg of the multi-year rising wedge. The 1-week MA 50 turned into a resistance when it last broke on the week of January 27, 2025. Once it breaks and closes above the range, one can expect a strong bullish upswing that happened during late 2024. Therefore, all eyes will now be on the current weekly close, which is now expected to rise above the 200-day weekly MA and surpass the 50-day MA. As the weekly MACD has already turned bullish, the ETH price is believed to revive a strong rise back to the psychological barrier at $4000. However, breaking this barrier is extremely crucial to keep up the bullish trend towards a new ATH.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/ethereum-gets-rejected-from-a-crucial-range-will-this-hinder-the-eth-price-rally-to-3000/,"BTC|ETH|TRADING","Price Analysis|Ethereum",cryptocompare

The rally has been clearly spot-driven , characterised by impulse moves higher following short, well-defined consolidation phases. This pattern suggests healthy accumulation and strong underlying demand rather than speculative excess. Spot Cumulative Volume Delta across major exchanges has remained positive, reinforcing the view that real buyers—rather than leveraged traders—are dominating the market. Meanwhile, derivatives positioning has been reactive , with open interest fluctuations highlighting a transition period marked by short squeezes and liquidation-driven resets. The result is a healthier foundation, with speculative froth cleared and momentum now underpinned by genuine capital flows. With Bitcoin just off its All-Time High, and spot premium remaining elevated, the current range-bound price action may simply represent a period of stabilisation before a potential breakout. While short-term pullbacks are still likely, the broader trend remains firmly constructive. That said warning signs continue to flash across the US economy, as inflation cools but deeper structural risks begin to surface. The Consumer Price Index rose just 0.2 percent month-over-month in April, and is up just 2.3 percent on the year—the lowest annual gain since early 2021. A drop in food prices helped ease the pressure from shelter costs, but the outlook remains clouded by uncertainty over tariffs and trade policy. Despite a temporary truce between the US and China, sweeping import tariffs remain, with more potentially on the way by July. These unresolved trade tensions create significant challenges for businesses and policymakers alike. At the same time, financial strain is building at the household level. Recent data from the New York Fed show a rise in 90+ day delinquencies on credit card and student loan balances, underscoring the fragile state of consumer finances. As tariffs begin to bite and inflation risks linger, the combination of slowing growth and rising prices—potential stagflation—could leave the Federal Reserve in a difficult position. For now, with core services and housing costs still elevated, the Fed is likely to remain cautious. But with economic pressures mounting, the coming months will demand both flexibility and vigilance. Institutional and corporate adoption of Bitcoin continues to grow, even amid market dips and regulatory uncertainty. Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment Company increased its holdings in BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) during Q1 2025, signalling long-term confidence despite a temporary drop in the ETF’s market value. Since its January 2024 launch, IBIT has led the US market for spot ETFs, drawing over $45.5 billion in inflows and managing $65.4 billion in assets. In Latin America, Brazilian fintech Méliuz became the region’s first public company to adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy. After purchasing 274.52 BTC worth $28.4 million, its total holdings now exceed 320 BTC. The move was backed by shareholders and was followed by a 116 percent surge in the company’s stock, reflecting strong investor support for crypto-based financial strategies. Meanwhile, the legal landscape remains tense. A US judge rejected a joint request from the SEC and Ripple to ease penalties and lift restrictions, citing procedural errors due to the case being under appeal. The decision stalls a potential settlement in a landmark case that could shape the future of crypto regulation in the US. Together, these events highlight both the momentum and the hurdles facing crypto’s growing role in finance.

Announced on May 19, this marks the company’s second-largest Bitcoin buy to date, as the cryptocurrency continues to hover just below its all-time high. With this acquisition, Metaplanet’s total Bitcoin holdings now stand at 7,800 BTC, valued at roughly $807 million at current market prices. The purchase follows closely behind its largest single buy of 1,241 BTC on May 12 for $129 million, a transaction that pushed its reserves past those of El Salvador. Metaplanet is now the largest corporate BTC holder in Asia and ranks tenth globally, according to data from BiTBO. The company has demonstrated a strong return on its BTC investment strategy. It posted a Bitcoin yield of 95.6% in the first quarter and has already achieved a 47.8% yield in the second quarter. This yield reflects the percentage growth in BTC holdings per fully diluted share, highlighting Metaplanet’s aggressive and consistent accumulation strategy. Closing in on Galaxy Digital’s Position If Metaplanet adds another 301 BTC to its balance sheet, it will surpass Galaxy Digital Holdings, which currently sits in ninth place among public companies with 8,100 BTC. At the top of the leaderboard remains Michael Saylor’s firm, Strategy, with a commanding 568,840 BTC—worth around $59 billion—under management. Metaplanet has notably ramped up its Bitcoin purchases in recent months. So far in May alone, the firm has added 2,800 BTC. In April, it made four separate buys totaling 794 BTC, and in March, six purchases brought in a combined 1,655 BTC. Michael Saylor Teases New Bitcoin Buy Meanwhile, Strategy founder Michael Saylor hinted at another upcoming purchase by sharing a screenshot of the firm’s BTC portfolio tracker on social media platform X, accompanied by the cryptic phrase, “Never short a man who buys orange ink by the barrel.” Strategy continues to lead all corporate buyers with 77% of the growth in corporate-held Bitcoin this year, according to investment firm River. River’s May 12 report also revealed that corporations have outpaced all other sectors—including ETFs, governments, and retail investors—as the largest net buyers of Bitcoin in 2025.

Today, Bitcoin even touched a high near $107,000 —fueling excitement among crypto investors. A key factor in this bullish trend is El Salvador’s bold Bitcoin investment strategy , which has generated impressive returns.

El Salvador’s BTC Holdings: $357 Million Unrealized Profit President Bukele’s recent X post confirmed the unrealized gains from their Bitcoin holdings: “Our BTC holdings have generated over $357 million in unrealized profit.” View Bukele’s post on X With the BTC price around $102K per token, the total value of El Salvador’s holdings stands at roughly $644 million . The country’s initial investment was approximately $287.1 million , meaning their Bitcoin assets have grown by an incredible 124.4% . .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Price Prediction This Week: Will BTC Break Past $106K or Pull Back? , Challenges Facing El Salvador’s BTC Strategy Despite the gains, El Salvador faces hurdles: The country is negotiating a financial package with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) , which requires limiting Bitcoin activities . A law was passed making Bitcoin usage voluntary for the private sector , not mandatory. Many global critics and some Bitcoin supporters have distanced themselves from El Salvador’s approach. However, President Bukele remains firm in his commitment: “If it didn’t stop when the world ostracised us and most ‘bitcoiners’ abandoned us, it won’t stop now, and it won’t stop in the future.” What This Means for Bitcoin’s Future El Salvador’s successful BTC investment highlights growing acceptance and confidence in Bitcoin as an asset and legal tender. Its experience could influence other countries considering similar moves, especially amid Bitcoin’s current bullish momentum. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Here Are the Details…","Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States, is facing a new lawsuit in the country. Accordingly, Coinbase is facing a class action lawsuit in the US state of Illinois over an alleged biometric data breach. Following the conclusion of its lawsuit with the SEC, Coinbase has faced new litigation, with a group of Coinbase users in the state of Illinois filing a class-action lawsuit against the exchange, alleging that the exchange’s identity checks violate the state’s Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA). Users allege in the lawsuit that Coinbase required users to verify their identity with a government-issued ID and processed the collection, storage, or sharing of biometric data without written notice or proper consent, thereby violating BIPA. The plaintiffs allege that Coinbase failed to inform users in writing about the collection, storage or sharing of their biometric data and the purpose and retention schedule of their data. The plaintiffs also alleged that Coinbase violated the law by sharing biometric data with third-party verification providers such as Jumio, Onfido, Au10tix, and Solaris without users’ consent. “Coinbase does not publicly provide a retention schedule or guidelines for the permanent destruction of Plaintiffs’ biometric identifiers as specified by BIPA.” Coinbase was also hit with a lawsuit filed by a group of Coinbase users in May 2023 alleging similar BIPA violations, but the case was dismissed by a judge. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-19T12:09:16.000Z,"XRP Price To Hit $5, $9 and $27?","The post XRP Price To Hit $5, $9 and $27? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP is currently in the spotlight as analysts debate whether it’s up for a massive breakout or a steep correction. Here’s what’s driving the hype and the caution. XRP Trend Shifts: Key Weekly EMA & SMA Strategy Analyst EGRAG Crypto’s latest analysis on XRP highlights a trading strategy based on the relationship between the 21-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the 33-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) on the weekly chart. According to EGRAG, these moving averages are key for spotting major trend shifts in the market. If the 21 EMA crosses below the 33 SMA, it signals a bearish trend, and we could be heading into a bear market. Historically, these crosses have led to significant price drops, with XRP falling 87% in May 2018 and 72% in November 2021. The next major drop could be around 79.5% from the bearish cross point. This is a key sell signal as it suggests that the top is in and a steep correction could follow, Egrag explains. Is XRP Entering A Long-Term Uptrend? On the flip side, a 21 EMA crossing above the 33 SMA is seen as a strong bullish signal, often preceding major price rallies. The analyst notes that the past bullish crosses have triggered massive pumps. This could be a sign that the market is entering a long-term uptrend, leading to much higher price levels, like the $5.7, $9.5, $27, and $37 targets mentioned. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : BitMEX Hints at Ripple Partnership: XRP Market on Bullish Alert , Double Digits Possible, Say Analysts XRP hitting double digits may sound a bit far-fetched, but history says it’s possible. In 2018, XRP controlled over 31% of the entire crypto market and hit $3.84. Now, in 2025, it’s trading around $3.34 but holds just 5% market share. If XRP reclaims even half of its old market dominance, it could see massive gains. This is especially possible if Bitcoin cools off and altcoins rally later. Will XRP Rally After Futures Launch? CME is launching XRP futures today . Some traders worry that this could lead to a short-term top, as similar futures launches for Bitcoin in 2018 had led to sharp sell-offs later. It had also coincided with the peak of the bull cycle at that time. XRP is currently trading at $2.32, down 2.9% ahead of the launch. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

It consists of three peaks: a higher peak (head) and two lower peaks (shoulders). It is resolved when the price breaks below the neckline (the line connecting the lows of the left and right shoulder), confirming the pattern and suggesting a potential sell signal.In XRP’s case, the pattern was validated following a break and close below the neckline at $2.33 during the early Asian trading hours on May 19. If the price stays below the neckline, the XRP/USD pair could slide further to $2.25 (where the 200-day simple moving average currently sits) and then to the pattern target of $2.00. This would bring the total losses to 14% from the current levels.XRP/USD four-hour chart.

2025-05-19T11:49:01.000Z,"Australian court ruling could lead to $640M in Bitcoin tax refunds","A court decision in Australia could open the door to as much as $640 million in capital gains tax (CGT) refunds on Bitcoin transactions after a judge ruled that crypto should be treated as money rather than a taxable asset. On May 19, the Australian Financial Review (AFR) reported that the decision arose within a criminal case involving federal police officer William Wheatley, who allegedly stole 81.6 Bitcoin (BTC) in 2019. At the time, the assets were worth roughly $492,000. At current market prices, the tokens are valued at more than $13 million.In the case, Judge Michael O’Connell of Victoria ruled that Bitcoin qualifies as a form of money rather than property, likening the digital asset to Australian dollars rather than to shares, gold or foreign currency.The interpretation could set a legal precedent, potentially placing Bitcoin transactions outside the scope of Australia’s current CGT regime.  New court ruling challenges Australian crypto tax lawsIn an AFR interview, tax lawyer Adrian Cartland said the verdict “totally upends” the Australian Taxation Office’s (ATO) current position. Since 2014, the ATO has classified crypto assets as CGT assets. This means that users must pay tax when selling or trading them. Under the ATO’s guidance, any disposal of Bitcoin, including selling it for fiat, exchanging it for another crypto or using it to purchase goods or services, constitutes a CGT event. This framework has been the basis for taxing cryptocurrency transactions in Australia for over a decade. However, the recent ruling challenges the approach by suggesting that Bitcoin functions more like money than property. This potentially exempts it from CGT.Related: Australian feds seize mansion, Bitcoin allegedly linked to crypto exchange hackTax refunds could reach $640 millionCartland said it was held that Bitcoin is Australian money. “That is, it is not a CGT asset. Therefore, acquisitions and disposals of Bitcoin have no tax consequences,” the tax lawyer added. If the ruling is upheld on the appeal, Cartland estimates that there could be potential tax refunds totalling 1 billion Australian dollars ($640 million). However, while Cartland thinks there could be up to a billion in refunds, the ATO said there were no official figures that confirm the amount to be potentially refunded if the case changes how Bitcoin is taxed in Australia. Magazine: Binance Wallet ‘killing’ MetaMask and airdrops, Chinese RWA tokens: Asia Express",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/australia-bitcoin-tax-ruling-cgt-refunds?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

This includes advisory, broker-dealer, custody, exchange, lending and borrowing, virtual asset (VA) management and investment, and VA transfer and settlement services. A VARA spokesperson told Cointelegraph that the updates will bring consistency across all activity-based rules defining core operational terms. The spokesperson gave examples of terms like “client assets,” “qualified custodians,” and “collateral requirements” as some of the terms more consistently defined in the update.  The update also aligned risk management and disclosure obligations, where activities overlap, in areas like brokerage, custody and exchange. “The aim was to reduce ambiguity and help VASPs navigate cross-functional compliance more easily,” VARA told Cointelegraph. Related: Dubai gov’t agencies to link real estate registry with property tokenizationDubai regulator tightens leverage thresholds for margin tradingAs for margin trading, the VARA spokesperson said they tightened leverage thresholds, mandated clearer collateralisation standards, and enhanced the monitoring obligations for VASPs offering this feature. Margin trading allows traders to control large positions with smaller amounts of capital. It amplifies both gains and losses. Tightening the leverage traders use helps limit the risks of widespread liquidations in a market downturn. The crypto regulator introduced a new section on token distribution that sets out licensing prerequisites, investor protections and marketing restrictions. The spokesperson emphasized the marketing restrictions, especially for “retail-facing offers.” “It’s about aligning with global conduct expectations and closing observed regulatory gaps,” the VARA spokesperson said. Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/dubai-crypto-regulator-updates-rulebooks-tightens-margin-trading?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-19T08:55:00.000Z,"Crypto drainers as a service: What you need to know","What is a crypto drainer?              A crypto drainer is a malicious script designed to steal cryptocurrency from your wallet. Unlike regular phishing attacks that try to capture login credentials, a crypto drainer tricks you into connecting your wallets, such as MetaMask or Phantom, and unknowingly authorizing transactions that grant them access to your funds.Disguised as a legitimate Web3 project, a crypto drainer is usually promoted via compromised social media accounts or Discord groups. Once you fall prey to the fraud, the drainer can instantly transfer assets from the wallet.Crypto drainers may take various forms:Malicious smart contracts that initiate unauthorized transfers.Fake NFTs or token systems that create deceptive exchanges or assets.Crypto drainers are a growing threat in Web3, enabling quick, automated theft of crypto assets from unsuspecting users through deception. Common methods of crypto drainers include: Phishing websites.Fake airdrops.Deceptive ads.Malicious smart contracts.Harmful browser extensions.Fake NFT marketplaces.                  Crypto drainers-as-a-service (DaaS), explained              DaaS elevates the threat of crypto drainers by commercializing them. Just like  software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms, DaaS platforms sell ready-to-use malware kits to cybercriminals, often in exchange for a percentage of the stolen funds.In the DaaS model, developers offer turnkey draining scripts, customizable phishing kits and even integration help in exchange for a share of the stolen funds. A DaaS offer might be bundled with social engineering support, anonymization services and regular updates, making them attractive even to low-skill scammers.Types of crypto DaaS tools include:JavaScript-based drainers: Malicious JavaScript is embedded into phishing websites that mimic legitimate decentralized apps (DApps). These scripts execute when you connect your wallet, silently triggering approval transactions that drain assets. Token approval malware: Tricks users into granting unlimited token access via malicious smart contracts.Clipboard hijackers: Hackers use clipboard hijackers to monitor and replace copied wallet addresses with those controlled by attackers. Info-stealers: They harvest browser data, wallet extensions and private keys. Some DaaS packages combine these with loader malware that drops additional payloads or updates the malicious code. Modular drainer kits: Segregated into modules, these drainers use obfuscation techniques to bypass browser-based security tools. Did you know? According to Scam Sniffer, phishing campaigns using wallet drainers siphoned off over $295 million in NFTs and tokens from unsuspecting users in 2023.                  What crypto DaaS kits include              Crypto DaaS kits are pre-built toolsets sold to scammers, enabling them to steal digital assets with minimal technical skill. These kits typically include phishing page templates, malicious smart contracts, wallet-draining scripts and more.This is what crypto DaaS kits generally include:Pre-built drainer software: Plug-and-play malware requiring minimal setup.Phishing kits: DaaS providers supply customizable phishing website templates that hackers can modify according to their plans.Social engineering: With DaaS, hackers find support for social engineering along with psychological tactics to trick users into connecting their wallets.Operational security (OPSEC) tools: To avoid detection, some DaaS vendors offer advanced operational security tools that mask user identity and hide digital footprints.Integration assistance and/obfuscation: These services help attackers deploy drainer scripts seamlessly and use obfuscation tools to evade tracking.Regular updates: Frequent improvements are designed to bypass wallet defenses and detection systems.User-friendly dashboards: Control panels that help attackers oversee operations and monitor drained funds.Documentation and tutorials: Step-by-step instructions enabling even beginners to execute scams efficiently.Customer support: Some DaaS operators provide real-time help through secure messaging apps like Telegram.With DaaS kits available for as little as $100 to $500, or through subscription models, sophisticated crypto attacks are no longer limited to experienced hackers. Even the inexperienced can now access these scripts with a small budget, effectively democratizing this type of crime.Did you know? Advanced DaaS tools often update scripts to evade detection from browser extensions like WalletGuard and security alerts issued by MetaMask or Trust Wallet.                  Evolution of crypto drainers as prominent fraudulent activity              The threat landscape of cryptocurrency fraud is constantly evolving. Emerging around 2021, crypto drainers have rapidly transformed the landscape. Their ability to stealthily siphon funds from users' wallets has made them a threat that demands vigilance.Drainers specifically designed to target MetaMask began to emerge around 2021 and were openly advertised on illicit online forums and marketplaces.Here are some prominent drainers that have been around for some time:Chick Drainer: It emerged in late 2023, targeting Solana (SOL) users through phishing campaigns. It operates using the CLINKSINK script, embedded in fake airdrop websites.Rainbow Drainer: The platform shares code similarities with Chick Drainer, suggesting potential reuse or collaboration among threat actors.Angel Drainer: Launched around August 2023, Angel Drainer is widely promoted on Telegram by threat groups like GhostSec. Affiliate scammers need to make an upfront payment between $5,000 and $10,000 and also pay a 20% commission on all stolen assets facilitated through its platform.Rugging’s Drainer: Compatible with several crypto platforms, this DaaS drainer offers comparatively low commission fees, typically ranging from 5% to 10% of the stolen proceeds. In the wake of the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s X account being compromised in January 2024, Chainalysis found a crypto drainer acting as the SEC. This led users to connect their wallets in an attempt to claim nonexistent airdropped tokens.According to a Kaspersky Security Bulletin, dark web threads discussing crypto drainers rose sharply in 2024, jumping by 135% to 129 threads from 55 in 2022. These conversations encompass a wide range of topics, including buying and selling malicious software and forming distribution teams.As the following chart demonstrates, crypto drainers have been stealing crypto at a faster quarterly growth rate than even ransomware.                  Red flags to identify a crypto DaaS attack              Spotting a crypto wallet drainer attack early is crucial to minimizing potential losses and securing your assets. You must be careful, as a sophisticated drainer attack can sometimes evade standard alert mechanisms. You must remain vigilant even while relying on automated tools. Here are a few indicators that your wallet may be under threat:Unusual transactions: A red flag of a drainer attack is finding transactions you didn’t authorize. These may include unexpected token transfers or withdrawals to unknown wallet addresses. Sometimes, attackers execute multiple small transfers to avoid detection, so you must monitor for repeated unusual transactions of low-value crypto. Lost access to wallet: If you cannot access your wallet or your funds are missing, it could mean an attacker has taken control. This often happens when the drainer changes private keys or recovery phrases, effectively locking you out. Security alerts from wallet providers: Your crypto wallet may issue security alerts for suspicious actions, like logins from new devices, failed access attempts or unauthorized transactions. These warnings indicate that someone may be trying to access your wallet or has already accessed it.Fake project websites or DApps: If you find a cloned or newly launched platform mimicking a real Web3 service and prompting wallet connections, it is a warning sign of a crypto drainer. It might also have urgent calls to action, urging users to immediately claim rewards, airdrops, or mint NFTs. The objective is to pressure victims into connecting wallets without verifying authenticity.Unverified social media promotions: Suspicious links shared via X, Discord, Telegram or Reddit, often unverified profiles, indicate a fraudulent attempt to drain money from a wallet. Fraudsters may also use compromised accounts to share malicious links. Unaudited smart contracts: Interacting with unfamiliar contracts without public audits or GitHub transparency can expose wallets to hidden drainer scripts.Wallet prompts requesting broad permissions: Sign-in or approval requests that ask for full token spending access or access to all assets, rather than specific transactions, are serious warning signs.Did you know? Just one popular drainer kit can be used by hundreds of affiliates. That means a single DaaS platform can be behind thousands of wallet thefts in a matter of days.                  How to protect your crypto wallet from DaaS attackers              To protect your crypto wallet from DaaS attackers, adopting strong, proactive security practices is essential. Blockchain monitoring tools can help identify suspicious patterns linked to drainer activity, allowing you to respond quickly. Here are key strategies to help protect your digital assets:Use hardware wallets: Hardware wallets, or cold wallets, store private keys offline, shielding them from online threats like malware and phishing. Keeping your keys in a physical device significantly lowers the risk of remote attacks and is ideal for securing long-term crypto holdings.Enable 2FA (two-factor authentication): Adding 2FA to your wallet means even if someone steals your password, they will need a second verification step. They need to put in a verification code sent to your phone to access the account, along with your password, making unauthorized access much harder.Avoid phishing links: Always verify URLs and avoid clicking on unsolicited messages claiming rewards or updates. Never input private keys or seed phrases on suspicious sites. When in doubt, manually enter the correct website address.Secure your private keys and seed phrases: Store your private keys and seed phrases offline in a safe, physical location. Never save these credentials on internet-connected devices, or hackers might get access to them, putting your wallet at risk. Verify apps and browser extensions: Take care to install software only from official sources. Research apps beforehand to avoid malicious or fake tools.Monitor wallet activity regularly: Check your wallet for unauthorized transactions or unusual patterns. Early detection can help stop further losses and improve recovery chances.                  What to do if you suffer from a crypto-drainer attack              Swift action is essential if you suspect your crypto wallet has been compromised. Though fund recovery is rare, quick action can limit further losses.Here are the steps you need to take if you suffer from a crypto DaaS attack:Secure your accounts: Immediately change the password for your wallet and enable 2FA, if you still have access to it. Transfer any remaining funds to a secure, uncompromised wallet.Notify your wallet provider or exchange: Report the incident to your wallet provider or exchange. You could request them to monitor your account or freeze suspicious activity. Platforms may flag suspicious addresses or prevent further transfers.File a report with authorities: Contact local law enforcement or cybercrime units, as cryptocurrency theft is treated as a financial crime in most regions.Seek professional assistance: Cybersecurity firms specializing in blockchain forensics can analyze transactions and potentially trace the stolen funds. While full recovery is unlikely, especially if assets pass through mixers or bridges, expert help may aid investigations.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/crypto-drainers-as-a-service-what-you-need-to-know?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The team claimed to have immediately responded and taken action involving multiple departments, including the firm’s chief operating officer, Helen Liu.Other people involved in the operation were the heads of customer service, risk control, the Chinese-language division, product managers and the technical team. The exchange coordinated its actions with the user.After an internal investigation, Bybit concluded this was a “unique case affecting an individual user, not a systemic issue.” The account’s KYC information was not tampered with and the funds in the account remained secure at all times.Bybit had not answered Cointelegraph’s request for comment at the time of writing.Related: A decade-old debate is back as self-custody gets smarterThe perks of media attentionBybit claims to have taken large-scale and timely action, which involved a member of its executive team, all in response to an issue reported by a single user. Chinese-speaking X crypto influencer EnHeng claimed to be the reason for this.In a separate post that Bybit’s X post answers to — EnHeng explained that in a group chat, he noticed “a girl mentioned a bug related to Bybit’s Apple ID.” He verified the issue and after confirming that it was real, flagged it to Bybit.EnHeng said that the staff responded quickly and assisted the user in recovering access to about $100,000 worth of funds. They highlighted:“This incident really made me feel the value of having influence.”EnHeng said “in this market, retail investors often lack a voice and are vulnerable.” For this reason, he said, “When we have more resources and a bigger voice, we should use them to speak up for retail investors.”Related: Self-custody vs. centralized crypto cards: Freedom or convenience?Locked out of exchangeBeing locked out of a cryptocurrency exchange account or some of its features is not excessively uncommon.

Indian cryptocurrency exchange Mudrex temporarily halted crypto withdrawals during the same month, claiming compliance improvements were the reason.Sometimes action is taken on the request of law enforcement. Last summer, a small set of Palestinian user accounts was frozen after Israeli authorities issued a seizure request. Also last summer, OKX warned it would terminate any account linked to crypto mixer Tornado Cash or sanctioned addresses, and several users said their log-ins were suddenly disabled.Those incidents echo an old adage popular in the Bitcoin (BTC) community: Not your keys, not your coins.

2025-05-19T07:55:20.000Z,"Vitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes for Ethereum scaling","Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin unveiled a proposal to preserve trustless, censorship-resistant access to Ethereum, even as the network scales. On May 19, Buterin shared a post outlining how to make Ethereum's layer-1 scaling “more friendly” to users running local nodes for personal use. The Ethereum co-founder highlighted the importance of independent users running nodes, saying that a market dominated by a few Remote Procedure Call (RPC) providers risks censorship. RPC providers let wallets, users and apps interact with the blockchain without running their own nodes. Crypto wallets are usually connected to an RPC provider behind the scenes. Buterin believes there are risks to this setup. “A market structure dominated by a few RPC providers is one that will face strong pressure to deplatform or censor users. Many RPC providers already exclude entire countries,” Buterin wrote. Source: Vitalik ButerinVitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes In addition to censorship, Buterin argued that reasons like expensive fully-trustless cryptographic solutions and metadata privacy show that there’s value in ensuring greater ease for those running a personal node. In the proposal, Buterin's solution relies on a novel type of node called “partially stateless nodes.” These nodes are designed to help users maintain privacy-preserving access to blockchain data without the heavy resource demands of running a full node. As Ethereum scales and the gas limit increases, running a full node requires more storage and bandwidth. Buterin said partially stateless nodes address the issue by allowing users to verify the blockchain and serve local data, but only store a subset of the Ethereum state, based on the user’s needs.Vitalik Buterin’s graphic of partially stateless nodes. Source: Vitalik ButerinRelated: Ethereum Foundation unveils security initiative to supplant legacy systemsA new node type to validate blocks “statelessly”The nodes would operate by validating blocks statelessly. This means they don't require the storage of the full Merkle proofs or the entire blockchain history. They can selectively keep certain parts of the state up to date. This means that users could configure their nodes only to save data related to their accounts, the decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, and their commonly used tokens like stablecoins and Ether (ETH). The rest of the data will be left out, and queries beyond the stored subset will fail or be routed through an RPC solution. Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/vitalik-buterin-partially-stateless-nodes-ethereum-scaling-privacy?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-19T07:38:51.000Z,"How to read a Bitcoin liquidation map (without getting liquidated)","Understanding a Bitcoin liquidation map is imperative in dealing with the inherent volatility of the crypto market. The visual tool showcases probable liquidation levels, indicating where large orders may cause cascading price changes. This post explores how to interpret a Bitcoin liquidation map, allowing you to trade smarter in the volatile world of cryptocurrency.What is liquidation in crypto trading?In cryptocurrency trading, liquidation happens when an exchange forcefully closes a trader's leveraged position due to insufficient margin to pay losses. This usually occurs when the market moves sharply against the position. Long liquidations occur when prices fall, affecting traders who bet on an uptrend. Short liquidations happen when prices unexpectedly rise, impacting those who bet on a decline. Did you know? In crypto, a single liquidation cascade can wipe out millions in minutes, triggered not by hacking but by traders using too much leverage at the wrong time.What is a Bitcoin liquidation map?A Bitcoin liquidation map is a visual heatmap indicating price levels where large liquidations are expected to occur. These maps assist traders in identifying zones where leveraged positions may be closed forcibly if prices fluctuate sharply. Tools like CoinGlass provide real-time Bitcoin (BTC) liquidation maps, valuable resources for risk-aware traders. With the liquidation map, you canUse breakout trading strategies for profitable scalping opportunities.Set stop-loss levels based on key liquidation zones for better risk management.Target high-liquidity areas to secure profits efficiently.Enter large trades near liquidity clusters to minimize slippage and enhance execution.Analyze the gradient of liquidation intensity to anticipate potential price movements..Functioning of a liquidation map and key components The X-axis of the liquidation chart represents the bid price, while the Y-axis denotes the relative strength of liquidation activity. Each column on the graphic illustrates a liquidation cluster's relative significance compared to other clusters.The chart demonstrates how the market will respond if the price reaches certain thresholds. Taller liquidation bars indicate a higher potential impact. The various hues are solely for visual clarity, allowing users to distinguish between distinct liquidation zones.Here are the main components of a liquidation map:Heat zones: Indicate where most positions could be eliminated if the price reaches specific levels.Liquidity pools: Collections of stop-loss and liquidation orders that can cause rapid price movements.Open interest levels: Demonstrate where large amounts of leveraged positions are concentrated.Price imbalances or gaps: Disclose areas without support or resistance, allowing prices to move swiftly.Did you know? Crypto liquidations often follow the herd; when too many traders place similar bets, liquidation maps light up and whales use them as price targets.How to use a liquidation map in your Bitcoin trading strategyA Bitcoin liquidation map provides insights into probable price movements and risk zones by visually representing places where leveraged positions will likely be closed. Here is how to use a liquidation map in Bitcoin trading:Identify high-risk zones: Identify places with dense liquidation clusters to avoid overleveraging. These areas come across as magnets, attracting price changes that might cause a series of liquidations.Time entry and exit: Liquidation clusters help find the optimal entry and exit points. Entering and exiting trades before a cluster becomes risky helps you lock in profits before reversals.Combine with technical indicators: Enhance your research by combining liquidation maps with tools such as support/resistance levels and relative strength index (RSI). This sets out a comprehensive view of market conditions.Avoid herd mentality: Exercise caution in places with high leverage concentrations. Such zones may be traps constructed by larger players to induce liquidations and profit from the resulting volatility.Monitor whale activity: Large traders frequently target liquidation zones to turn price moves to their advantage. Observing these patterns can provide insights about prospective market movements.Anticipate reversals: Markets frequently experience reversals following large liquidation events. Recognizing these trends can aid in positioning for possible rebounds.Implement robust risk management: Use stop-loss orders and handle leverage carefully. Liquidation maps can help you determine where to put these orders to minimize exposure.Common mistakes to avoid when using the Bitcoin liquidation mapUsing a Bitcoin liquidation map can enhance trading decisions, but misinterpretation can lead to costly errors. Here are common mistakes you need to avoid:Blindly trading toward liquidity zones: If you are trading toward liquidity zones without thinking, expect reversals.Misreading map colors or scale: Making a mistake in judging map colors or scale can skew your risk assessment.Over-relying on liquidation data without context: Maps are valuable tools, not an assurance that what they reflect will happen.Ignoring macro news or sentiment analysis: External events often override technical signals. A sudden event may make all predictions fall flat.Always combine liquidation maps with broader technical analysis. Smart trading requires context, not just colorful charts.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Source: PACERCoinbase reported on May 15 that four days earlier it had been hit with a $20 million extortion attempt after cybercriminals bribed several of its customer support agents to access internal systems and steal a limited amount of user account data.The stolen data included names, addresses, phone numbers, emails, the last four digits of Social Security numbers, some bank account identifiers, driver’s licenses, passports and some account data, such as balance snapshots and transaction history.Bender claimed that “Coinbase failed to implement and maintain reasonable security safeguards,” which exposed users to “serious and ongoing risks.”The suit also claimed Coinbase’s response to the incident was “inadequate, fragmented, and delayed.”“Users were not promptly or fully informed of the compromise, and Coinbase did not immediately take meaningful steps to mitigate further harm,  provide identity protection services, or offer actionable guidance to affected individuals,” the complaint claimed.The lawsuit claimed users could face “substantial, immediate, and ongoing threat of identity theft and financial fraud” and that the consequences of the breach could be long-term or “potentially permanent” because the compromised information can’t be recovered or made secure once exposed.Flurry of lawsuits make similar allegations Two other lawsuits filed in a New York federal court made similar claims against Coinbase, while a fourth lawsuit added the allegation of unjust enrichment, arguing that Coinbase didn’t spend enough on data security measures.All four complaints ask for damages and other measures to help protect the plaintiff’s sensitive data.Meanwhile, a fifth lawsuit filed in a California federal court on May 15 made similar claims against Coinbase, but asked the court to order Coinbase to purge all sensitive data it holds about the plaintiffs and hire third-party security auditors to test its security systems, among other requests.A Coinbase spokesperson did not comment on the lawsuits and instead pointed Cointelegraph to a blog post it shared regarding the data breaches.Coinbase said it refused to pay the $20 million ransom and has flagged plans to reimburse users tricked into sending crypto to phishing scammers due to the data breach.In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the exchange said it expects reimbursement expenses ranging from $180 million to $400 million.Related: Retired artist loses $2M in crypto to Coinbase impersonatorThe exchange also reportedly fired a group of customer support agents based in India following their alleged involvement in social engineering attacks on users.Coinbase (COIN) shares dipped 7% and dropped to $244 after it disclosed the data breach along with an ongoing SEC probe over misstated user numbers in 2021.The stock has since staged a comeback, spiking 9% and hitting $266 by the closing bell on May 16, according to Google Finance. Coinbase has climbed even higher following the data breach.

Bitcoin developer John Carvalho introduced Bitcoin Improvement Proposal-177 on April 23, which seeks to eliminate the concept of satoshis, of which there are 100,000,000 in 1 Bitcoin (BTC), and effectively split Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million into 21 quadrillion units.It follows a 2017 proposal from Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song to create “bits,” representing one-millionth of 1 Bitcoin. However, Carvalho said Song’s approach would still require Bitcoin users to think about decimals and “shifts complexity rather than eliminating it.”Block Inc. CEO Jack Dorsey is among those calling for the change, saying in a May 18 X post that satoshis, or sats, are too confusing for newcomers.“Bits of Bitcoin is better, and just Bitcoin is best,” Dorsey said.Dorsey pointed to a December 2024 discussion on the topic where Stevie Lee, product lead of Bitcoin infrastructure firm Spiral, argued that not enough people know or care about what satoshis are.“Everyone knows Bitcoin, no one knows sats, people just want to send and receive Bitcoin,” Lee said, recalling past conversations where people thought satoshis were an entirely new token, unrelated to Bitcoin.He added that the Bitcoin community shouldn’t be too concerned with the change, as they know the underlying economics of Bitcoin would remain intact.Related: DOJ charges 12 more gamer-turned $263M Bitcoin robbersSwan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten and Byte Federal director of product Michelle Weekley were among those who opposed the change.“People understand cents in a dollar, they will understand sats in a Bitcoin,” Weekley said on X.Magdalena Gronowska, a self-described Bitcoin consultant, claimed that the change could make some people think that Bitcoin abruptly crashed from its current price of around $100,000 and that its “supply has massively inflated.”Zaprite business development lead Parker Lewis argued that sats were easier to understand.

2025-05-18T15:00:00.000Z,"Don’t believe the noise: There can never be too many L2s","Opinion by: Igor Mandrigin, co-founder and CTPO of Gateway.fmEvery couple of weeks, it seems another layer 2 rolls out, much to the chagrin of some Web3 industry commentators who are concerned about fragmentation. A recent Gemini Institutional Insights report actually noted how a new Ethereum L2 solution is launched approximately every 19 days. In response to the seemingly endless conveyor belt of new zkEVMs and optimistic rollups coming to market, the chorus of criticism continues to grow louder: “This is definitely the saturation point, no more chains are needed.”Some of the most outspoken critics of L2s argue that L2s are redundant, but this is narrow thinking. In many ways, the idea that creating new L2s should be slowed down is like arguing that there were too many websites in 1998. The proliferation of L2s is not causing the Web3 space to become overly bloated or fragmented at all. The number of chains today isn’t too many. It’s laughably few, and right now is the early innings of a multi-decade explosion in specialized, modular blockchain infrastructure.The rise of L2s is far from a passing fadWhile some contend that this L2 surge we’ve been experiencing is merely a temporary frenzy led by DeFi degenerates, it’s really an enterprise-grade infrastructure expansion, as banks (including Deutsche Bank), game studios (gaming activity on some L2 blockchains rose by over 20,000% in February 2025), logistics networks and global manufacturers get on board. Industries like banking and logistics, which are typically risk-averse, don’t make major tech pivots lightly. They do so because they have to, and in many cases, public blockchains do not meet their needs. Returning to their inherent risk-averse DNA, large enterprises and institutions in these sectors generally won’t want to build on shared, general-purpose L1s. Instead, they’ll want to deploy their own chains where they can enjoy custom performance, predictable costs, jurisdictional compliance and granular-level privacy.This focus on proprietary networks isn’t solely a Web3 thing. Let’s think about it. Did Facebook, Netflix and JPMorgan co-host on GeoCities? Of course not, so why would Web3 be any different? Shared L1s and monolithic architectures might have worked for early token experiments and composable DeFi primitives. Still, realistically, they can’t support real-world businesses’ complexity, regulatory burden or contractual requirements.The growing viability of L2sThanks to modular stacks, rollup-as-a-service platforms and breakthrough zero-knowledge proof technology, spinning up a dedicated chain is becoming increasingly viable and accessible to a wide range of enterprises across the industry spectrum. As the infrastructure improves, the cost of launching and maintaining specialized chains will also reduce, so a substantial rise in the number of L2s can be expected as time goes on.Recent: Devs introduce Ethereum R1 layer-2 scaling solutionSome onlookers will argue that this future will be convoluted for users forced to hop between chains while voicing concerns about liquidity fragmentation and the dispersal of tradable assets across multiple platforms. These are short-sighted concerns. We’re building toward seamless interoperability through shared settlement layers, trust-minimized bridges and unified account abstraction. Ultimately, the end-user won’t care whether they’re on rollup #4,318 or chain #9,072; they’ll just transact with ease and be happy with that. In the same way that cloud computing unlocked hyper scale by abstracting the hardware layer, modular blockchains are unlocking hyperscale for value transfer, asset issuance and programmable trust. Irrespective of what the doubters say, specialized L2s won’t cannibalize each other. They’ll serve different verticals, jurisdictions and use cases. There is no reason why an L2 for high-frequency trading can’t easily coexist with an L2 for national land registries.We’re not drowning in chains — we’re barely ankle-deep in the grand scheme of things. Anyone seriously betting on consolidation or some magical “winner-take-all” chain is just betting against scale and sovereignty. The real bet is hundreds of L2s and thousands of use cases as part of one modular, scalable future.Opinion by: Igor Mandrigin, co-founder and CTPO of Gateway.fm.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

He pushed for a configurable, default policy discouraging the use of Bitcoin for storing JPEGs rather than monetary data.Blockstream CEO Adam Back challenged the proposal, describing inscription filtering as an “arms race.” He noted that spam data embedded in Bitcoin transactions can be endlessly modified using code structures, requiring constant updates to filtering tools.Source: Adam BackRelated: Bitcoin Ordinals vs. Ethereum NFTs: A comparative overviewAmmous compares Bitcoin spam to emailAmmous compared the Bitcoin spam issue to email spam — another arms race society continues to fight without abandoning the system.“It’s not easy, but it’s worth trying to help bankrupt the spammers faster,” Ammous said. He argued that fighting spam is not censorship, noting that node operators already reject invalid transactions.“So a node runner looking to remove retards' spam is no less valid than retards' spam,” he added.The debate drew commentary from other users. One participant suggested Core developers treat spam-coding employees at certain startups as “unwilling QA engineers” and simply unstandardize every trick they deploy.Ammous took it further, proposing to “deprecate” the work of developers building spam tools and even hiring outside coders to overwhelm their systems.Source: Saifedean AmmousThe conversation reflects ongoing tensions in the Bitcoin community over the network’s intended use. With inscriptions continuing to congest the network, calls for technical countermeasures — and pointed critiques of those defending spam — are growing louder.In a Feb. 4 report, Mempool Research said the adoption of inscriptions could drive the Bitcoin network’s average block size as high as 4 megabytes (MB) per block, far higher than current averages.Bitcoin’s average block size — the amount of data in each block posted to the network’s public ledger — is currently around 1.5 MB.Magazine: Arthur Hayes $1M Bitcoin tip, altcoins’ powerful rally’ looms: Hodler’s Digest, May 11 – 17",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/saifedean-ammous-funds-dev-to-fight-bitcoin-spam?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The other 10 individuals, aged between 20 and 41, were arrested soon after.Police seized approximately HK$1.05 million ($134,370) in cash, over 560 ATM cards, multiple mobile phones, bank documents and records related to crypto transactions.Senior Inspector Tse Ka-lun of Hong Kong’s Commercial Crime Bureau claimed that the individuals often used bank accounts from their friends and family to launder the stolen funds. Hong Kong reported a 12% year-on-year increase in fraud reports in 2024, with authorities making more than 10,000 fraud-related arrests. Of those arrests, around 73% involved individuals who held stooge bank accounts.Related: DOJ charges 12 more gamer-turned $263M Bitcoin robbersThe crackdown comes as Hong Kong continues to roll out its crypto regulatory framework to support local innovation, protect consumers and establish itself as a crypto hub.Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission introduced new rules for crypto exchanges offering staking services in April.

2025-05-17T15:21:23.000Z,"A Bitcoiner’s guide to South Africa’s Garden Route","South Africa’s Garden Route, famed for its lush forests, expansive beaches and charming towns, has become a testbed for Bitcoin adoption.From Mossel Bay to Witsand and Plettenberg Bay to Knysna, Bitcoin has become popular among shop owners and travelers alike for a multitude of reasons.“We’re seeing the early signs of a parallel, permissionless economy emerging across an entire region,” James Caw, founder of SimplB — a local crypto asset provider — told Cointelegraph, “where small businesses benefit from faster, lower-cost digital payments and where people have more options to earn, send and receive sound money securely.”For tourists, the benefits are immediate: no currency exchange hassles, no international card fees, and the ability to pay instantly and securely. For locals, Bitcoin (BTC) offers a hedge against inflation, protection from currency volatility and new economic opportunities.Here’s a taste of what a Bitcoin-friendly trip along the Garden Route is like.The Garden Route is where Bitcoin meets paradiseThe Garden Route is one of South Africa’s premier tourist corridors. It stretches roughly 300 kilometers from Mossel Bay in the west to the Storms River Mouth in the east, attracting hundreds of thousands of tourists yearly.Crypto adoption is escalating thanks to South Africa’s regulatory environment, which now recognizes Bitcoin as a financial product. Across the Garden Route, you can spend pre-acquired Bitcoin freely, with little concern for local tax or exchange controls.It’s a grassroots movement. Towns like Witsand and Plettenberg Bay are at the forefront, and national retailers like Pick n Pay provide a safety net for crypto spending along the way. Every Pick n Pay store, including supermarkets, clothing outlets and Express convenience stores, accepts Bitcoin via the CryptoQR app. This guarantees you can always buy daily goods with Bitcoin wherever you travel. Related: Stablecoin fever: 5 major stablecoins are growing crypto adoptionWitsand is the Bitcoin villageLocated at the mouth of the Breede River, Witsand is a sleepy coastal town with a big reputation in the Bitcoin world. Here, Bitcoin isn’t just accepted — it’s preferred.It’s thanks to the efforts of local champions like Edwin Jones, a software engineer and passionate supporter of Bitcoin adoption in the Garden Route. Witsand has become a functioning Bitcoin circular economy. Accommodation options like Fantasea and Happy Days holiday homes, meals at Ellie’s on Main, groceries at local shops, gym memberships, boat services, petrol, surf lessons and mini-golf can be paid for using Bitcoin.As Jones notes: Bitcoin Witsand existed long before we gave it a name. It was just having conversations with friends, and as the local businesses started understanding Bitcoin, they actually demanded we start getting the technology in place.The town’s small and close-knit community has enabled rapid adoption; more than 45 establishments accept Bitcoin as of early 2025. The town’s enthusiasm is infectious, as locals and visitors enjoy the ease and security of digital payments.Witsand proudly announces its acceptance of Bitcoin. Source: Edwin JonesWitsand’s success as a Bitcoin hub is rooted in its community-driven approach. Jones outlines its growth by outlining that: Although there have been many individual businesses over the years since 2009 that started and stopped accepting Bitcoin for the Garden Route, the adoption really started kicking off in 2021.“With the Lightning Network starting to reach maturity around that time, the first Spaza Shop in Mossel Bay, Bitcoin Ekasi, started accepting Bitcoin in August 2021, and the first restaurant in Witsand in December of the same year.”Education has been central to the process. Local advocates have focused on teaching business owners the fundamentals of Bitcoin, warning against scams and emphasizing the difference between Bitcoin and speculative altcoins. “With all the circular economies advocating against gambling and trading, cautioning against interest and investments, being explicitly Bitcoin, and focusing on the fundamentals rather than the price, scammers have been kept at bay,” Jones said. “We have also found that businesses don’t have to adapt as much as evolve.”Bitcoin doesn’t change a business — it just supercharges it. Doing the same old things, much better.Mossel Bay’s surf and social upliftmentMossel Bay, the historical gateway to the Garden Route, is not just about beaches and maritime history. Mossel Bay is home to Bitcoin Ekasi, a pioneering project that brought Bitcoin to the township of JCC Camp.Bitcoin Ekasi empowers unbanked residents by enabling them to earn and spend Bitcoin locally. Coaches at The Surfer Kids nonprofit are paid in Bitcoin, and local spaza shops accept Bitcoin for daily necessities.For the Bitcoiner tourist, Mossel Bay offers a unique opportunity for “conscious crypto-tourism.” You can take surf lessons from instructors paid in Bitcoin, visit the Bitcoin Ekasi education center, or support the project with direct donations.The town also boasts a Pick n Pay that accepts Bitcoin. As SimplB’s Caw observes: The Bitcoin Ekasi project first started when they began accepting Bitcoin because of the demand from foreign tourists visiting Mossel Bay. It is just so simple to function on a Bitcoin standard once you begin using it.Plettenberg Bay is the fastest-growing Bitcoin economyFurther east, Plettenberg Bay has witnessed an explosion in Bitcoin adoption. In just a few months, the number of Bitcoin-accepting merchants jumped from five to more than 75, making it one of Africa’s most dynamic crypto economies.Confirmed acceptors include Ferris Cars (which facilitates rental accommodation payments in crypto), Glow Lighting Design and all local Pick n Pay branches. Adventure tourism companies, boutique retailers and professional services are increasingly receptive to Bitcoin, especially if you ask. The rapid growth suggests an enthusiastic local scene, with businesses eager to tap into the spending power of Bitcoin tourists.Related: 8 major crypto firms announce US expansion this yearPlettenberg Bay offers a vibrant mix of beach life, nature and crypto-friendly commerce. The town’s energy is palpable, and visitors are encouraged to engage with merchants, share information about Lightning payments, and help grow the ecosystem.“Right now Plettenberg Bay is by far the most interesting circular economy in Africa and possibly the world,” said Jones. “It currently boasts having the most businesses accepting Bitcoin of any town in Africa and has achieved this in less than three months.”Bitcoin preferred signs can be found along the Garden Route. Source: Edwin JonesSedgefield is a quiet pioneerSedgefield, a tranquil town between Knysna and Wilderness, played a key role in the national rollout of Bitcoin payments at Pick n Pay. It was one of the trial sites for the innovative QR code converter from MoneyBadger, which enables Bitcoin spending at every Pick n Pay in South Africa.Sedgefield itself doesn’t have the same density of Bitcoin-accepting independent merchants as Witsand or Plettenberg Bay, but the presence of Pick n Pay ensures that crypto tourists can always pay for groceries and essentials with sats.Practical information for your tripIf you do make it out to the Garden Route, recommended wallets include Blink, Wallet of Satoshi and Phoenix — all Lightning-enabled and widely used in the region. In larger towns like Knysna, George, Wilderness and Oudtshoorn, the Bitcoin scene is still emerging. There aren’t yet established circular economies, but the nationwide acceptance of Bitcoin at Pick n Pay provides a reliable foundation for spending.The Spasie on Breede Restaurant and Bar is just one of many establishments accepting Bitcoin. Source: Edwin JonesBTC Map occasionally lists independent merchants, like Beans About Coffee in Oudtshoorn. Still, the best strategy is to ask around, look for Bitcoin signage, and use mapping tools to discover new acceptors.For accommodation, activities and dining, direct inquiry remains key. Many guesthouses and tour operators are open to Bitcoin payments, especially as awareness grows. Online platforms like Bitrefill enable you to buy gift vouchers for major retailers using Bitcoin, providing a workaround for places that don’t yet accept crypto directly.Happy travels.Magazine: Pranksy: Inside the anonymous life of an NFT legend — NFT Collector",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoiners-guide-south-africa-garden-route?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-17T15:00:00.000Z,"The DeFi mullet — Fintech needs DeFi in the back","Opinion by: Merlin Egalite, co-founder at Morpho LabsFintechs in the front, decentralized finance (DeFi) in the back: the DeFi Mullet.Today’s fintech companies offer excellent user experiences but are constrained by traditional financial infrastructure — siloed, slow, expensive and inflexible. Meanwhile, DeFi provides lightning-fast, cost-effective, interoperable infrastructure but lacks mainstream accessibility.The solution? Combine fintech’s distribution and user experience with DeFi’s efficient back end.The mullet is inevitableFintech companies heavily rely on traditional financial (TradFi) infrastructure that is siloed, slow to deploy and run, and costly to maintain. This inefficiency limits their control over costs and product offerings and has potential infrastructure risks. Fintechs have a strong incentive to transition to building on autonomous, credibly neutral public infrastructure.The power of DeFi is evident in stablecoins. While traditional international wire transfers cost $30–$50 and take one to five business days, stablecoin transfers cost mere cents and settle in seconds. This revolutionary improvement in financial infrastructure extends beyond payments. DeFi provides 24/7/365 infrastructure for trading, lending and borrowing with instant settlement, open access and deep liquidity, enabling better price execution and yields.Plugging their compliance-ready front end into DeFi infrastructure, fintech companies can focus on creating exceptional user experiences. This opens up tremendous opportunities for innovation while driving more liquidity onchain, creating a positive feedback loop of embracing the DeFi Mullet.Now is the time for mainstream adoptionToday’s DeFi ecosystem has proven its reliability for fintech integration. There are dozens of protocols that demonstrate this maturity, securely managing billions in loans through immutable, governance-minimized designs. DeFi infrastructure gives fintechs complete control over their infrastructure. This is particularly crucial after the recent Synapse bankruptcy that trapped Yotta user funds meant to be insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.Recent: Bitcoin DeFi will have 300M users, beating Ethereum and Solana: ExecInstitutions are also coming onchain. BlackRock has tokenized a fund via Securitize; Stripe has acquired Bridge for $1 billion to scale its stablecoin solutions; the US is creating a strategic Bitcoin (BTC) reserve; and clarity on regulation is opening the floodgates. The shift is step-by-step but tangible.DeFi has arrived.The next phaseFor years to come, expect more products like crypto-backed loans to be released by fintech’s most advanced players, offering onchain saving accounts, onchain loans, instant international payments and more. This transformation will be invisible to users and powered by smart wallets and account abstraction that maintain the familiar Web2-like user experience at which fintech companies excel. Early adopters will gain significant advantages over competitors.Yet, unlike building on traditional finance, DeFi’s open infrastructure means even latecomers can benefit from existing network effects without starting from zero.Some skeptics argue that the involvement of fintechs and traditional institutions will erode decentralization, as protocols must comply with regulatory requirements. While this concern is understandable, the opposite is more likely.Expecting protocols to achieve compliance across every jurisdiction worldwide is unrealistic, especially given the vast regulatory fragmentation. Instead, regulating the apps that interface with users makes far more sense rather than the underlying protocols. For this regulatory model to work, however, protocols must remain credibly neutral.A credibly neutral mechanism adheres to four principles:It embeds no preference for specific individuals or outcomes.It is open-source with publicly verifiable execution.It is simple and understandable.It changes infrequently.Examples like HTTP and SMTP demonstrate the power of credibly neutral protocols — they are free, open and unregulated, with only the clients subject to oversight. The same logic should apply to governance-minimized, immutable DeFi protocols.These constraints will push DeFi builders toward creating genuinely decentralized and trustless systems.Fintechs integrating DeFi protocols can build on top of the most neutral infrastructure and access their growing network effects.Let the mullet growThe DeFi mullet is more than just a meme — it’s a structural shift.To scale, DeFi must meet users where they are: through regulated, user-friendly fintech channels. For fintechs to stay relevant, they must offer their customers the best user experience and opportunities, such as the best rates. Those who miss this opportunity risk falling into irrelevance, much like traditional retail banks losing market share to today’s fintechs.This convergence isn’t just possible — it’s inevitable.Opinion by: Merlin Egalite, co-founder at Morpho Labs.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Now it’s less than two times.” He pointed to increased involvement from pension funds and ETF issuers as evidence of a more mature, stable market.The shift, he argued, reflects a broader trend of institutional adoption. “The more institutional money, the more Wall Street money, the more long-term holders get involved, the less volatility there’s going to be,” Melker explained.Related: New Bitcoin price all-time highs could occur in MayCrypto markets show signs of strength in 2025Market activity in 2025 has already shown signs of strength. Bitcoin surged past $104,000, while Ether (ETH) reclaimed levels above $2,600.Coinbase’s addition to the S&P 500 marked a major milestone for crypto’s integration into mainstream finance. Melker noted the company is not just entering the index but doing so in the top 50 by market cap — a reflection of how deeply rooted some crypto firms have become.In addition to Coinbase, firms like Galaxy Digital and eToro have moved forward with public listings, signaling confidence in regulatory conditions under the current US administration.Melker said that this environment, bolstered by dropped SEC lawsuits and favorable executive orders, has created what he calls “an extremely bullish” backdrop for the sector.While Bitcoin remains the primary focus, Melker acknowledged a renewed interest in altcoins. Recent price action saw Ethereum outpace Bitcoin, triggering a rally across smaller-cap tokens — a sign, he said, that “new money” is entering the space rather than just rotating within it.Related: Here is why Bitcoin price is stuck below $105KDon’t rule out a wild runDespite the optimism, Melker tempered expectations, noting that most experts are forecasting cycle highs between $120,000 and $150,000.

2025-05-17T09:12:28.000Z,"Everstake defends non-custodial staking as SEC weighs industry input","The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has held discussions with Everstake, one of the largest non-custodial staking providers globally, to explore clearer regulatory definitions around staking in blockchain networks.The meeting, which also involved the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, comes at a time when over $193 billion in digital assets are staked across major proof-of-stake (PoS) networks.However, despite the massive scale of participation, staking remains in a legal gray zone in the US as regulators wrestle with its classification under existing securities law.The previous SEC administration also took enforcement actions against major players such as Kraken, Coinbase, and Consensys due to their staking services. The agency, under pro-crypto President Donald Trump, has recently dismissed these enforcement actions.During the meeting, Everstake told the SEC that non-custodial staking should not be classified as a securities transaction. The company said that users maintain full control over their digital assets throughout the staking process and do not transfer ownership to a third party.They argued that this makes staking a technical function, not an investment product.“Our main assertion is that staking is not a financial instrument or security transaction, but rather a technical process, a base-layer protocol mechanism—akin to an oracle in a database—that maintains the integrity and functionality of decentralized networks,” Everstake founder Sergii Vasylchuk told Cointelegraph.Everstake team meeting with the SEC. Source: EverstakeRelated: SEC delays staking decision for Grayscale ETH ETFsEverstake calls for regulatory clarityIn a letter submitted to the SEC’s Crypto Task Force on April 8, 2025, Everstake asked the agency to extend regulatory clarity to non-custodial staking and custodial and liquid staking models.In the letter, which came in respond to Commissioner Hester Peirce’s call for input on regulatory treatment of blockchain services, Everstake argued that non-custodial staking should not be considered a securities offering.It claimed that non-custodial staking, where users retain control of their tokens, does not involve the pooling of assets or the expectation of profits from managerial efforts.In its model, Everstake said users delegate only validation rights while maintaining ownership of their digital assets. The staking rewards are algorithmically distributed by the blockchain network itself, and the firm merely provides technical infrastructure.Related: Ethereum ETF staking will have little impact without multimonth rally: AnalystNon-custodial staking fails the Howey testThe letter also details why non-custodial staking fails each prong of the Howey test. Users do not make an investment of money in a common enterprise, do not expect profits from Everstake’s efforts, and are not dependent on the company’s management for financial returns.Instead, any rewards come from network-level incentives and fluctuate with the market value of the underlying asset.Everstake proposes specific criteria that should exempt non-custodial staking from securities classification. These include user asset control, absence of pooled funds, permissionless unstaking, and the provision of purely technical services.It likens non-custodial staking to proof-of-work mining, which the SEC has previously ruled out as a securities transaction.Margaret Rosenfeld, Everstake’s chief legal officer, also told Cointelegraph that “with non-custodial staking, there’s no handover of assets, no investment contract, and no third-party risk.” She added:“Treating it as a securities offering undermines the decentralized model and risks chilling innovation in the blockchain sector.”Nevertheless, the SEC has so far withheld a definitive stance. Rosenfeld said that the agency did not make any “specific commitments” on staking guidance. However, it continues to listen to industry stakeholders.“The Task Force is actively engaging with a range of stakeholders—including those involved with non-custodial staking, ETFs, and broader blockchain infrastructure—to gather input.”In an April 30 letter to the SEC, nearly 30 crypto advocate groups led by the lobby group the Crypto Council for Innovation (CCI) asked the agency for clear regulatory guidance on crypto staking and staking services.Magazine: Binance Wallet ‘killing’ MetaMask and airdrops, Chinese RWA tokens: Asia Express",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/everstake-defends-non-everstake-sec-non-custodial-staking-guidance-staking-as-sec-weighs-industry-input?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-17T00:57:29.000Z,"Bitcoin bull flag and standard profit taking hint at eventual rally to new BTC price highs","Key takeaways: Traders expect a Bitcoin price pullback to $90,000, but a bull flag could break out to new highs if profit taking near the range highs reduces. On-chain data suggests the current profit taking is too weak to extinguish Bitcoin’s current price momentum. Bitcoin (BTC) price has spent the bulk of the week pinned below $104,000 to $105,000, which many analysts have labelled as a resistance zone, but an alternative view suggests that BTC is simply consolidating within a bull flag. A bull flag is a continuation pattern that is characterized by a period of sideways price action following a sharp uptrend, and when the structure confirms or breaks from the trendline resistance, the uptrend continues. BTC/USDT 1-day chart. Source: TRDR.ioWhile the range-bound trading portion of the flag is said to represent indecision from buyers and sellers, in this scenario, the absence of buy volume is the primary culprit. As shown in the TRDR.io chart below, Bitcoin’s explosive move to $105,900 from $74,400 was accompanied by large liquidations in the margin markets and robust spot volumes, which aligned with several days of billion-dollar spot BTC ETF inflows. BTC/USDT 1hr chart. Source: TRDR.ioDuring this three-week period, several US-based and international companies also announced plans to purchase Bitcoin and establish BTC treasuries. The spot and futures cumulative volume delta, along with the open interest metric on the chart show traders selling near the range highs and the absence of new long leverage and significantly sized spot positions being opened in this area, whereas drops to range low (bull flag support) sees bids filled on the spot side, but there is still limited use of margin for fresh longs. BTC/USD spot and margin CVD. Source: TRDR.ioBitcoin’s recent cool-down phase is a normal outcome after the near 40% recovery that started on April 8, and the loss of upward momentum resulting from profit-taking in futures markets near the current range high is also to be expected. Bitcoin short-term holder supply profit and loss data from Glassnode supports this view, as shown in the chart below. The onchain data company highlighted profit taking for short-term traders but explained that it does not exceed the statistical norm, leaving room for further price upside. “Recently, the magnitude of STH Realized Profit has surged to almost +3 standard deviations above its 90-day average, reflecting a notable uptick in profit realization. In past cycles, particularly during rallies towards the ATH, this metric has historically climbed to over +5 standard deviations of more. This signals that much stronger profit-taking pressure is often required to overwhelm the inflow demand.” BTC: Short-term holder activity in profit and loss.

2025-05-16T21:40:24.000Z,"Filecoin, Lockheed Martin send data in space using decentralized data protocol","The Filecoin Foundation and Lockheed Martin Space have successfully transmitted data in space using a version of the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) on a satellite orbiting Earth, Marta Belcher, president of the Filecoin Foundation, told Cointelegraph. Filecoin and Lockheed Martin adapted the system for use in space and successfully tested it, Belcher said during the Consensus 2025 conference in Toronto.The IPFS enhances privacy and security compared to traditional web protocols, such as HTTP, by identifying data based on its content rather than its location. This has additional benefits for data transmission in space, Belcher said.“The architecture is well-suited to space because it reduces delays, compensates for data corruption caused by radiation, and enables cryptographic verification to ensure data has not been tampered with,” she said.The foundation is a nonprofit governing the decentralized cloud storage protocol Filecoin (FIL), which uses the IPFS web protocol to store data. Lockheed Martin is one of the world’s largest aerospace companies.Source: Filecoin FoundationDecentralized storage benefits“There’s a multi-second delay from the Moon and a multi-minute delay from Mars,” Belcher said.“With IPFS, you look for a content ID and retrieve the data from wherever is closest — your own device, a nearby satellite, or a lunar station.”Additionally, the IPFS uses a distributed architecture to store multiple copies of data across a global network, reducing reliance on centralized data centers.These multiple copies of data improve reliability in environments where hardware is prone to degradation, helping to ensure the integrity of sensitive materials such as satellite images, according to Belcher.Interest in decentralized archival storage is growing among media companies, and the Foundation is also exploring potential military applications of this technology, Belcher said.“It could be really powerful for media in general to have that deep archive and also the ability to have your records everywhere all over the world when needed,” she said.The FIL token is a utility token that can be used within the Filecoin ecosystem. It has a total market capitalization of approximately $1.8 billion as of May 16, according to Cointelegraph data.
