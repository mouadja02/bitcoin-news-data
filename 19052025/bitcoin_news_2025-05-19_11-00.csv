2025-05-19T08:52:45.000Z,"Bitcoin Juggling Between Pivotal Levels-Here’s What’s Next for the BTC Price Rally if it Plunges Below $102K","The post Bitcoin Juggling Between Pivotal Levels-Here’s What’s Next for the BTC Price Rally if it Plunges Below $102K appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin’s price recorded the highest weekly close in history, above $107,000, clearing the path towards a new ATH. Meanwhile, the bears have intensified their action, which has dragged the levels below the previous day’s open range, raising huge concerns over the upcoming price action. On the other hand, BTC’s liquidity range has entered a crucial phase wherein a strong conflict between the bulls and the bears could be seen as a means of gaining supremacy in the coming days. Ever since the BTC price triggered a rebound from the local lows, the whales and the bulls seem to have become more optimistic. As a result, more long traders were being placed with massive leverage. This made the retail traders bullish on Bitcoin, offering a strong boost to the BTC price rally, which almost marked the highs. Frightfully, these whales have begun to extract profit, which seems to be a major reason behind the current downfall. As suggested by the above data, a Hyperliquid whale who had placed a 40x long trade on Bitcoin has begun to take profits after earning $10 million in 24 hours. Interestingly, the whale still holds a massive $337 million long position on BTC, which shows a serious conviction. Now the question arises whether the Bitcoin bull run has more room or it’s time for the exit door. The daily chart of Bitcoin continues to remain under bullish influence, despite the bearish interference. The price just faced a rejection before entering the final resistance zone below the ATH, which suggests a final correction before marking a new high. The On-Balance Volume has been plunging, which indicates a drop in the buying activity with an increase in the sell-offs. However, the MA levels keep up some hope as the BTC price could be heading towards a Golden Cross. The 50/200-day MA is heading for a bullish crossover, which usually triggers a massive upswing. Hence, the upcoming monthly close could have a major impact on the upcoming rally, as a successful completion of a Golden Cross could propel the BTC price above $110,000. In case of a failure, the star crypto may begin with a strong pullback, extending the correction phase.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-juggling-between-pivotal-levels-heres-whats-next-for-the-btc-price-rally-if-it-plunges-below-102k/,"BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|ZRX|TOKEN SALE","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-05-19T08:48:00.000Z,"Coinbase sued in Illinois over biometric data practices tied to KYC checks","Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase is facing a class-action lawsuit in the U.S. state of Illinois, which claims that the company may have violated the state’s Biometric Information Privacy Act. A group of Coinbase customers has accused the platform of improperly collecting and storing facial data during its identity verification process. Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on May 13, the lawsuit alleges that Coinbase’s Know Your Customer checks involve scanning users’ facial geometry without proper notice or consent, a move the plaintiffs say directly breaches Illinois’ biometric privacy laws. According to the complaint, users were required to upload a government-issued ID and a selfie, which were then processed by third-party facial recognition software. The group claims this process captured their biometric identifiers, such as faceprints, without prior written notice or notification of the collection without a publicly available “retention schedule or guidelines” for data destruction, as required under BIPA. “ At no point during the Verification Process are Coinbase users asked to consent to the collection of their biometric information, notified that their biometric data will be collected by an unrelated third party, nor provided with any information about the process, how it works, the type of information and data collected, whether said data is stored or disclosed to other entities, or any information about the retention or destruction of their biometric information.” Bernstein v. Coinbase Global, Inc. According to the complaint, Coinbase transmitted facial data to third-party vendors, including Jumio, Onfido, Au10tix, and Solaris, without obtaining explicit permission. You might also like: Coinbase impersonators steal over $2m in BTC and ETH from retired artist Further, it claims that more than 10,000 individuals have filed for arbitration over these issues, but Coinbase has allegedly failed to pay the necessary arbitration fees, resulting in many of those cases being dismissed. That being said, the group is pushing for financial penalties of up to $5,000 per reckless violation, or $1,000 where negligence is found, in addition to legal expenses and injunctive relief. Coinbase has not publicly commented on the lawsuit at the time of writing. Interestingly, this isn’t the first time Coinbase has been in hot water over alleged BIPA violations in Illinois. As previously reported by crypto.news, a class-action lawsuit filed by a local in May 2023 targeted the exchange over its collection of facial data and fingerprint templates through its mobile app. That case was eventually paused after a judge approved Coinbase’s motion to move the dispute into arbitration. The lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice in February this year, after both parties agreed to drop the case. Making matters worse, Coinbase has also come under fire over a recent data breach involving customer support agents allegedly bribed to leak user data. At least six related lawsuits have since been filed, intensifying scrutiny over the platform’s handling of sensitive information. In other news, Illinois recently dropped a separate lawsuit against Coinbase over its staking program, following similar moves by Kentucky , Vermont, and South Carolina after the SEC dismissed its own case.

2025-05-19T08:46:53.000Z,"Apple KYC glitch on Bybit draws swift executive response to recover $100K","Cryptocurrency exchange Bybit said it had involved team members, including an executive, to fix a glitch that affected a single user who could not go through an Apple-based know-your-client (KYC) system. In a May 18 X post , the Bybit China Team said it received reports about users experiencing withdrawal restrictions on the Bybit platform due to a KYC verification anomaly when logging in with an Apple ID. The team claimed to have immediately responded and taken action involving multiple departments, including the firm’s chief operating officer, Helen Liu. Other people involved in the operation were the heads of customer service, risk control, the Chinese-language division, product managers and the technical team. The exchange coordinated its actions with the user. After an internal investigation, Bybit concluded this was a “unique case affecting an individual user, not a systemic issue.” The account’s KYC information was not tampered with and the funds in the account remained secure at all times. Bybit had not answered Cointelegraph’s request for comment at the time of writing. Related: A decade-old debate is back as self-custody gets smarter The perks of media attention Bybit claims to have taken large-scale and timely action, which involved a member of its executive team, all in response to an issue reported by a single user. Chinese-speaking X crypto influencer EnHeng claimed to be the reason for this. In a separate post that Bybit’s X post answers to — EnHeng explained that in a group chat, he noticed “a girl mentioned a bug related to Bybit’s Apple ID.” He verified the issue and after confirming that it was real, flagged it to Bybit. EnHeng said that the staff responded quickly and assisted the user in recovering access to about $100,000 worth of funds. They highlighted: “This incident really made me feel the value of having influence.” EnHeng said “in this market, retail investors often lack a voice and are vulnerable.” For this reason, he said, “When we have more resources and a bigger voice, we should use them to speak up for retail investors.” Related: Self-custody vs. centralized crypto cards: Freedom or convenience? Locked out of exchange Being locked out of a cryptocurrency exchange account or some of its features is not excessively uncommon. Often, it is an emergency measure meant to prevent fund losses. A recent example is Phemex crypto exchange halting withdrawals after being alerted to nearly $30 million worth of suspicious outflows that raised alarms among blockchain security firms in late January. Indian cryptocurrency exchange Mudrex temporarily halted crypto withdrawals during the same month, claiming compliance improvements were the reason. Sometimes action is taken on the request of law enforcement. Last summer, a small set of Palestinian user accounts was frozen after Israeli authorities issued a seizure request. Also last summer, OKX warned it would terminate any account linked to crypto mixer Tornado Cash or sanctioned addresses, and several users said their log-ins were suddenly disabled. Those incidents echo an old adage popular in the Bitcoin (BTC) community: Not your keys, not your coins. This statement is meant to remind Bitcoin — and now crypto — users that real control over assets comes only with control over the private keys that allow for signing transactions.

Analysts highlight $97,000–$98,500 as key support that the bulls must hold. A potential inverse head-and-shoulders pattern points to a retest of $91,000 before any bullish continuation. Bitcoin ( BTC ) is down over 4.5% from its intraday high on May 19, falling to around $102,000 in its worst daily drop in over a month. BTC/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView BTC’s drop accompanied downside moves elsewhere in the risk market, prompted by Moody’s latest downgrade of the US government due to a rising budget deficit and the lack of a credible fiscal consolidation plan. The decline confirms a bearish divergence and, combined with other technical factors, raises the risk of a BTC price breakdown below $100,000, a key support level. Bitcoin’s bearish divergence hints at sub-$100K Bitcoin’s price action showed technical weakness ahead of its May 19 sell-off. On May 19, BTC pushed to a new local high above $107,000, but its relative strength index (RSI) printed a lower high, confirming a classic bearish divergence. Source: Bluntz This discrepancy between price and momentum is often a precursor to a trend reversal, and in this case, it played out with a swift 4.5% intraday decline. Analyst Bluntz warned traders to “be careful with [placing] longs.” Swissblock analysts observed that Bitcoin “grabbed liquidity” above the $104,000–$106,000 resistance range but failed to sustain a breakout.

The Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act (SB 21) will receive a second reading in the House of Representatives on May 20. This process is a mandatory step for the bill to be brought to a final vote. Satoshi Action Fund (SAT) co-founder Dennis Porter announced on social media that SB 21 is moving forward in the House. If the bill passes a full vote in the House before the end of the legislative session on June 2, it will be submitted to the Texas Governor for approval. Related News: List of Altcoins to Watch in the Coming Week Published - Here Are the Details SB 21 was first passed by the Texas Senate on March 6, 2025, with a vote of 25 yes and 5 no. The bill was then referred to the House of Representatives, where it passed the Committee stage without any changes on May 8, 2025, and was brought to the floor of the House for a floor vote. The bill would establish a Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve at the state level. The reserve fund would be funded by legislative appropriations, private revenue sources, purchased crypto assets, investment income, and donations. Advanced security measures such as cold storage would be implemented. The law will also require the establishment of an advisory committee to provide strategic guidance on the fund's management and the publication of a transparent reserve report every two years. *This is not investment advice.

He believes a massive financial crisis is looming and urges people to prepare themselves instead of waiting for government help. He says every crisis keeps getting bigger because the core issue, fiat money, was never fixed after 1971, when the US left the gold standard. In 1998 Wall Street got together and bailed out a hedge fund LTCM: Long Term Capital Management. In 2008 the Cental Banks got together to bail out Wall Street. In 2025, long time friend, Jim Rickards is asking who is going to bail out the Central Banks? In other words each… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) May 18, 2025 Major Financial Collapse Ahead Kiyosaki pointed to the bailout of hedge fund LTCM by Wall Street in 1998, then the rescue of Wall Street by central banks during the 2008 financial crisis. Now in 2025, he highlights a more pressing concern raised by his long-time friend Jim Rickards. With central banks under pressure, the question is no longer who they will save, but who will save them. Kiyosaki warns that the next domino to fall could be the $1.6 trillion in student loan debt, which Rickards believes could spark a financial breakdown of historic proportions. The veteran investor says this goes well with his long-standing belief that traditional fiat currencies are fundamentally broken. Once again echoing his famous quote, “Savers are losers”, Kiyosaki urges individuals to stop relying on governments or central banks for security. Q: Why will gold, silver, and Bitcoin continue to grow in value? A: The Marxist Central Bank system is crashing…. Many going bankrupt. Keep HODLing. I am and buying more Bitcoin. I predict Bitcoin climbs to $250 k this year. Buy more. Do not sell. — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) May 17, 2025 Kiyosaki says the way to protect your wealth and freedom is by rejecting government money and choosing assets like Bitcoin, gold, and silver. He believes these real assets help people avoid losing control to a system he sees as heading toward socialism through economic manipulation. Kiyosaki likened the current system to Marxist-style control, warning that fake data and corrupt leadership hurt the economy and take away people’s wealth and freedom. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Arthur Hayes Reveals Bold Crypto Market Prediction 2025 , What does it mean for you? Overall, Kiyosaki’s message shows the rising doubt people have in the current financial system. His advice to invest in real assets like gold and Bitcoin matches what we’re seeing in the current scenario, as central banks are buying more gold, big investors are turning to Bitcoin , and more Americans are worried about growing U.S. debt and money printing. That said, while student loan debt is a huge problem, it may not be the only thing that could cause a financial crash. Experts are also watching other risks, like unpaid commercial property loans, more companies going bankrupt, and the government’s rising debt. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-19T08:11:24.000Z,"Why Pi Network Listing on Coinbase Matters More Than Binance","The post Why Pi Network Listing on Coinbase Matters More Than Binance appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Many people in the Pi Network community are waiting for the big moment—when Pi finally gets listed on a major exchange like Binance. But for some, it’s not just about any exchange. It’s about Coinbase, the most trusted crypto platform in the U.S. According to crypto analyst Mr. Spock 𝛑 , a listing on Coinbase could unlock Pi’s true value and bring it closer to real-world use. Coinbase Isn’t Just an Exchange—It’s a Gateway to Utility Coinbase isn’t just another platform, it’s a fully regulated U.S.-based exchange, trusted by millions and deeply rooted in the American financial system. And when a coin gets listed on Coinbase, it doesn’t just become tradable, it becomes usable. Coinbase offers real-world tools, like the Coinbase Visa card, which lets users spend their crypto like cash. Mr. Spock explains his personal experience of how he uses this card to pay for food, shop at stores like Walmart, and even withdraw cash from ATMs, all while earning Bitcoin rewards on every purchase. He imagines a world where Pi Coin pays for meals, gas, and groceries, and rewards users with crypto benefits, not in theory, but in practice. Why Coinbase Is Better Than Binance for Pi Further, Mr. Spock also makes a strong case for why Coinbase matters more than Binance, especially in the U.S. He notes that Binance.com and Binance.US are completely separate, with the U.S. version offering fewer coins and features. Binance.com is unavailable to American users due to regulatory restrictions, while Binance.US operates under a different company with limited reach. On the other hand, Coinbase has regulatory clarity and deeper market integration, something Pi would benefit from if it wants to grow in the U.S. Pi’s Real Goal To Mr. Spock and many Pi supporters, this isn’t just about price—it’s about purpose. If Pi becomes spendable through Coinbase tools like the Visa card, it could finally blend crypto with daily life. That’s when the real impact begins, not just building wealth, but changing how we use money altogether. So while many are waiting for any exchange, some believe that waiting for Coinbase is worth it.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-pi-network-listing-on-coinbase-matters-more-than-binance/,"BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|BNB","News",cryptocompare

He warned that many older tokens, what he called “dino coins,” are unlikely to recover due to high fully diluted valuations, limited float, and no real users or revenue. “You probably have a bunch of coins in your portfolio that went down 95%, and they’re not moving for a reason,” he said When asked about Ethereum ( ETH ) versus Solana ( SOL ), Hayes said he expects ETH to outperform in the upcoming bull cycle. Despite Solana’s significant rally from $7 to over $170, he pointed to Ethereum’s deeper fundamentals, highest total value locked, most developers, and stronger security from its proof-of-stake design as key advantages.

For this year, he sees Bitcoin rising to around $250,000. On macro trends, Hayes criticized U.S. Treasury tactics for masking the country’s true borrowing needs. He believes the government is effectively spending more than reported by draining cash reserves and tapping underfunded programs. This, he said, creates excess dollar liquidity, an environment that favors Bitcoin and risk assets. Hayes also revealed that gold makes up 20% of his investment portfolio, including physical holdings and mining stocks. He expects central banks to keep buying gold and believes the U.S. may eventually revalue its gold holdings to help weaken the dollar. In his view, gold could reach $10,000–$20,000 before this market cycle ends. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading near $103,000, roughly 6% below its all-time high of $108,786 set earlier this year.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) saw modest losses, dropping 1% over the last 24 hours to trade above $102,900.

On May 17, the rating giant cut the US sovereign credit rating to Aa1 from Aaa, citing the country’s ballooning $36 trillion national debt , persistent fiscal deficit, rising interest expenses, and a lack of political will to rein in spending. This downgrade, the first from Moody’s since 1919, has rattled financial markets, pushing Treasury yields higher and triggering “risk-off” sentiment. “Yields are surging again following the Moody’s downgrade on Friday,” said capital markets commentator, The Kobeissi Letter, in a May 19 post on X, adding: “Trade deals, recession worries, lower inflation, and slowing GDP all can’t get lower yields.” Increasing US Treasury Bills.

Meanwhile, the US Federal Reserve remains adamant about not cutting rates , with market participants pricing in only two possible rate cuts in 2025, according to the CME Group FedWatch Tool . The downgrade signals higher economic uncertainty, prompting investors to withdraw from speculative assets, including crypto. Long liquidations accelerate ETH downtrend Ether’s tumble over the past 24 hours coincided with a wave of long liquidations that forced traders to exit their leveraged positions.

2025-05-19T08:02:32.000Z,"Australian Hacker Forfeits Assets in $2.88M Crime Proceeds Case","An Australian man has been forced to surrender nearly $2.88 million (4.5 million AUD) worth of assets—comprising Bitcoin, a waterfront mansion, and a Mercedes-Benz—after the Australian Federal Police (AFP) claimed the items were potentially acquired through a crime. The seizure was made by the AFP-led Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce (CACT), which announced the action in a statement issued on May 18. According to authorities, the case dates back to 2018 when Luxembourg law enforcement tipped off the AFP about suspicious Bitcoin transactions linked to the Queensland man. Investigators said they traced the activity back to earlier cyber offenses, including the theft of 950 Bitcoin from a French cryptocurrency exchange in 2013. Although no criminal charges were filed over the Bitcoin theft, a court ruled that the assets in question could not be tied to any legitimate income, leading to the forfeiture order issued in April. Ties to Crime and Gaming Industry Data Leaks Local media reports identified the individual as Shane Stephen Duffy, who pleaded guilty in 2016 to fraud and hacking charges. He was convicted of selling stolen personal data belonging to players of the popular online game League of Legends. While Duffy was not directly involved in the 2011 cyberattack on Riot Games that exposed data from over 5 million users, prosecutors confirmed he had obtained and resold the data independently. Further accusations included hacking the social media account of Riot Games’ president Marc Merrill to promote a service offering unauthorized access to players’ accounts. This crime history, along with the mystery surrounding the origin of Duffy’s wealth, contributed to the AFP’s decision to pursue asset forfeiture under the Proceeds of Crime Act. AFP Targets Criminal Profits to Fund Community Safety Commander Jason Kennedy of the AFP emphasized that the agency’s legal framework allows it to act decisively in confiscating assets suspected to be linked to criminal conduct—even without laying new charges. “The profits derived from criminal activities are also often used to fund further criminal acts,” Kennedy stated. “That’s why we work closely with our partners in the CACT to ensure such proceeds are reinvested in the community.” The confiscated assets will be sold, and the proceeds will go to a special purpose fund aimed at supporting law enforcement and crime prevention initiatives . Since July 2019, the CACT has restrained over $1.2 billion in criminally-linked assets, including luxury items like homes, vehicles, yachts, cryptocurrency, and fine art.

2025-05-19T08:00:52.000Z,"Crypto Watchlist: Top Analyst Reveals 5 Altcoins With Major Upside","In his latest market rundown, Amsterdam-based trader and educator Michaël van de Poppe warns that “retail isn’t here in the markets as of yet” and notes that the widely-followed Altcoin Season Index is still languishing around 29—well below the 50-point threshold that would signal a rotation out of Bitcoin and into the broader market. Against that still-cautious backdrop, Van de Poppe argues that the recent 38–42 percent rebound in the ETH/BTC pair is the first concrete sign of capital rotating down the risk curve, echoing on-chain data that show Ethereum clawing back ground after months of under-performance. “We’ve had a 40% return against Bitcoin in just a week,” he says, “and therefore the blue chips or the large caps are the ones to watch.” Crypto Watchlist: Top 5 Altcoins Van de Poppe’s thesis rests on a classic money-flow model: funds move from Bitcoin to Ethereum, then to large-cap altcoins, mid-caps and, finally, into the smallest caps once animal spirits truly take hold. With that framework in mind, he singles out five names that he believes sit at different rungs of the risk ladder, each with a specific macro- or sector-level tail-wind. Related Reading: Crypto Bulls Just Got Their Macro Wake-Up Call: Here’s Why The first pick, Chainlink (LINK), is Van de Poppe’s “easiest play” on institutional adoption because “we require oracles to provide data in the web-3 space to connect between web 2 and web 3.” The analyst emphasises that LINK’s bitcoin-denominated chart is “still at an all-time low,” suggesting asymmetric upside if a true altseason materialises. Next on the large-cap list is Aave (AAVE). Van de Poppe calls the decentralised lending protocol “a large cap which implies less risk,” but adds that the market is under-pricing its role in bringing bank-grade yield products on-chain. Notably, the token has attracted high-profile flows this cycle—Donald Trump–linked World Liberty Financial disclosed cumulative AAVE purchases alongside LINK and ETH earlier this year. Moving down the capitalization spectrum, the analyst turns to Wormhole (W), a cross-chain messaging and liquidity layer he describes as “being used to transfer between the chains,” with revenues that cycle back into the protocol. He flags its selection as exclusive bridge infrastructure for multiple real-world-asset initiatives in which “tokenised T-bill funds” migrate across networks. Wormhole’s fundamentals received a liquidity boost when Binance listed the W token with four trading pairs on 3 April 2024, broadening access for retail and institutional desks alike. Related Reading: Analysis: Crypto Heats Up As $35 Billion Enters Market In Under A Month For investors willing to venture further out on the risk curve, Van de Poppe highlights Peaq (PEAQ), a layer-1 focused on DePIN and the machine economy. “It’s the largest ecosystem within the machine economy and … finally waking up again,” he says, citing on-chain data that already show more than 50 companies and six-million devices active on the network. He argues that growing transaction counts and cross-industry partnerships make PEAQ “interesting for an investment thesis” at current valuations. His smallest-cap mention is Alkimi (ADS), which he dubs “an advertising project” whose revenue “has gone 4x from $1.2 million to $5 million” even as the token corrected from $0.50 to $0.10 during the recent macro-driven sell-off. Alkimi positions itself as a decentralised ad exchange designed to cut supply-chain fees and provide on-chain transparency, a use-case the company claims can slash CPMs by over 200 percent for advertisers. Van de Poppe closes with portfolio construction advice rather than price targets. “The larger the market cap, the longer it’s in business, the larger your allocation can be because the lower the risk involved. The smaller and newer the project, the smaller the allocation,” he says. At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $3.18 trillion.

Solana and MAGACOIN FINANCE May Lead the Next 20,000% Cycle","The 2025 crypto market is alive with speculation as investors look for the next altcoin to deliver extraordinary returns. While Bitcoin) continues to chart new highs and anchor the market, attention is rapidly shifting to high-potential tokens like XRP, Solana, MAGACOIN FINANCE , and Trumpcoin. Each of these coins brings a unique story and technical setup, but only a few may lead the next parabolic cycle. Here’s how they stack up as the market eyes another round of explosive gains. CLICK HERE – SECURE YOUR SPOT BEFORE 25x DISAPPEARS Bitcoin (BTC): Bullish Momentum and New Highs Bitcoin remains the market bellwether, recently gaining over 40% in a month and reclaiming the $100,000 mark. Technical indicators remain bullish, with the price expected to average around $120,000 in May and possibly reach $136,000 by month’s end. Analysts suggest the top is not yet in, with some forecasts targeting $150,000 or even $220,000 later this year if bullish momentum continues. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Standing Out From Other Tokens Unlike most low-cap tokens vying for investor attention, MAGACOIN FINANCE has carved out a powerful niche. Its message resonates, its structure is sound, and its early support is strong enough to challenge more established names. Built on a platform of capped supply, cultural resonance, and clear direction, it’s quickly transitioning from outsider to contender. What mak es MAGACOIN FINANCE particularly interesting now is how early investors are treating it—as a long-term play, not just a trade. It’ s rare to see this level of commitment before listings even begin. And with social and market momentum continuing to rise, many believe this may be the only time to catch it before it breaks out fully. XRP (XRP): Parabolic Setup in Motion XRP is again in the spotlight, trading above $2.30 and showing signs of a classic parabolic breakout. The resolution of Ripple’s legal issues and the prospect of an XRP ETF have attracted institutional interest and renewed bullish sentiment. Technical analysts point to a breakout above $2.40 as a key signal, with targets ranging from $4.50 to $7 in the coming months Solana (SOL): Strong Fundamentals, Bullish Patterns Solana continues to impress, trading near $170 and consolidating just below major resistance. Technical indicators remain bullish, with the potential for a breakout above $200 to trigger a run toward $180–$190 in the coming months. Trumpcoin (TRUMP): Volatility and Political Hype Trumpcoin (TRUMP ) has seen bursts of activity tied to political sentiment, but its outlook for 2025 is mixed. Forecasts suggest a possible decline of over 40% this year, with limited upside compared to fundamentally stronger or more community-driven projects. While it may benefit from election-year , its long-term prospects remain uncertain. THE MOST-WATCHED PRESALE OF 2025 – ACT NOW Conclusion MAGACOIN FINANCE , stands out as the breakout presale, combining scarcity, viral appeal, and early-stage momentum for those seeking the next 20,000% winner. Trumpcoin, despite its political branding, appears less likely to deliver sustained gains. For investors chasing the next explosive cycle, MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP are firmly in the spotlight, with Bitcoin’s strength providing the foundation for another historic bull run To learn more about MAGACOIN FINANCE, please visit: Website: https://magacoinfinance.com Twitter/X: https://x.com/magacoinfinance Continue Reading: XRP’s Parabolic Setup?

2025-05-19T07:55:20.000Z,"Vitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes for Ethereum scaling","Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin unveiled a proposal to preserve trustless, censorship-resistant access to Ethereum, even as the network scales. On May 19, Buterin shared a post outlining how to make Ethereum’s layer-1 scaling “more friendly” to users running local nodes for personal use. The Ethereum co-founder highlighted the importance of independent users running nodes, saying that a market dominated by a few Remote Procedure Call (RPC) providers risks censorship. RPC providers let wallets, users and apps interact with the blockchain without running their own nodes. Crypto wallets are usually connected to an RPC provider behind the scenes. Buterin said there are risks to this setup. “A market structure dominated by a few RPC providers is one that will face strong pressure to deplatform or censor users. Many RPC providers already exclude entire countries,” Buterin wrote. Source: Vitalik Buterin Vitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes In addition to censorship, Buterin argued that reasons like expensive fully-trustless cryptographic solutions and metadata privacy show that there’s value in ensuring greater ease for those running a personal node. In the proposal, Buterin’s solution relies on a novel type of node called “partially stateless nodes.” They are designed to help users maintain privacy-preserving access to blockchain data without the heavy resource demands of running a full node. As Ethereum scales and the gas limit increases, running a full node requires more storage and bandwidth. Buterin said partially stateless nodes address the issue by allowing users to verify the blockchain and serve local data, but only store a subset of the Ethereum state, based on the user’s needs. Vitalik Buterin’s graphic of partially stateless nodes. Source: Vitalik Buterin Related: Ethereum Foundation unveils security initiative to supplant legacy systems A new node type to validate blocks “statelessly” The nodes would operate by validating blocks statelessly. This means they don’t require the storage of the full Merkle proofs or the entire blockchain history. They can selectively keep certain parts of the state up to date. This means that users could configure their nodes only to save data related to their accounts, the decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and their commonly used tokens like stablecoins and Ether ( ETH ). The rest of the data will be left out, and queries beyond the stored subset will fail or be routed through an RPC solution.

This move comes in the wake of Moody’s downgrading U.S. credit , stripping the country of Aaa rating due to mounting deficits and escalating interest expenses. The last time the long end of the yield curve reached 5% was on April 9, during the so-called \""tariff tantrum,\"" which triggered sharp sell-offs in both crypto and U.S. equity markets. At that time, bitcoin (BTC) was hovering near its local low of around $75,000. It has since rebounded strongly, currently trading around $103,000 after hitting a Sunday high of $106,000. “The last time the 30-year closed at or above 5% (at the 6 PM ET mark) was October 31, 2023. The highest closing yield in recent memory was 5.11% on October 19, 2023, the highest since July 2007, nearly 18 years ago. The current yield is just 12 basis points away from surpassing that milestone,” said Jim Bianco, head of Bianco Research. In addition, the United Kingdom surpassed China in March to become the second-largest foreign holder of U.S. Treasuries, with holdings totaling $779.3 billion—trailing only Japan, which remains the top foreign holder. Both China and Japan have continued to reduce their U.S. Treasury holdings over the past 12 months, underscoring the growing need for the U.S. to attract new buyers for its debt.

With the broader cryptocurrency market heating up again in May 2025, the race is on to find the next low-priced token with real potential. While Bitcoin has broken the $100,000 mark and Ethereum continues to dominate DeFi infrastructure, the spotlight is shifting to penny cryptocurrencies under $1—projects that are cheap now but backed by utility, transparency, and strong community engagement. Among these, Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) offers the perfect storm of meme culture, AI functionality, and long-term upside—all at a price tag of just $0.004. Let’s break down why this might be the best crypto to buy now before the next rally. Why Invest in Crypto Now May 2025 has kicked off a new phase in the market. Bitcoin's recent breakout has reawakened retail and institutional interest, while Ethereum has surpassed $62 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to DeFiLlama. From a macro perspective, bullish sentiment is returning due to global capital shifts, potential tax reforms, and growing blockchain adoption. Now isn’t just a good time to watch—it’s a time to act. Here’s why: The market is climbing, driven by institutional inflows. Penny cryptos offer affordable entry points for new and seasoned investors. Bullish narratives like AI, staking, and community-led growth are attracting capital. If you want to get in before the next bull run, this is the kind of market phase where fortunes are made. What to Look for in the Best Crypto to Buy Now Not all low-priced cryptocurrencies are worth your time. Here’s how to identify the best altcoins to buy now—before they explode: Utility and innovation – Does the project solve a problem or offer something different? Dawgz AI integrates real-time AI tools, setting it apart from basic meme tokens. Community engagement – The strength of a token’s following can drive price action more than any chart. Tokenomics – Transparent distribution models and staking options often indicate long-term planning. Security – Audited code is a must in a space where rug pulls still exist. Cultural momentum – In 2025, tokens combining viral appeal with real functionality are leading growth. By applying these filters, Dawgz AI stands out as a top crypto to buy heading into summer. Why Dawgz AI Stands Out With a presale price of just $0.004, Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) is not only affordable—it’s building on real fundamentals.

2025-05-19T07:38:51.000Z,"How to read a Bitcoin liquidation map (without getting liquidated)","Understanding a Bitcoin liquidation map is imperative in dealing with the inherent volatility of the crypto market. The visual tool showcases probable liquidation levels, indicating where large orders may cause cascading price changes. This post explores how to interpret a Bitcoin liquidation map, allowing you to trade smarter in the volatile world of cryptocurrency. What is liquidation in crypto trading? In cryptocurrency trading , liquidation happens when an exchange forcefully closes a trader's leveraged position due to insufficient margin to pay losses. This usually occurs when the market moves sharply against the position. Long liquidations occur when prices fall, affecting traders who bet on an uptrend. Short liquidations happen when prices unexpectedly rise, impacting those who bet on a decline. Did you know? In crypto, a single liquidation cascade can wipe out millions in minutes, triggered not by hacking but by traders using too much leverage at the wrong time. What is a Bitcoin liquidation map? A Bitcoin liquidation map is a visual heatmap indicating price levels where large liquidations are expected to occur. These maps assist traders in identifying zones where leveraged positions may be closed forcibly if prices fluctuate sharply. Tools like CoinGlass provide real-time Bitcoin ( BTC ) liquidation maps, valuable resources for risk-aware traders. With the liquidation map, you can Use breakout trading strategies for profitable scalping opportunities. Set stop-loss levels based on key liquidation zones for better risk management. Target high-liquidity areas to secure profits efficiently. Enter large trades near liquidity clusters to minimize slippage and enhance execution. Analyze the gradient of liquidation intensity to anticipate potential price movements.. Functioning of a liquidation map and key components The X-axis of the liquidation chart represents the bid price, while the Y-axis denotes the relative strength of liquidation activity. Each column on the graphic illustrates a liquidation cluster's relative significance compared to other clusters. The chart demonstrates how the market will respond if the price reaches certain thresholds. Taller liquidation bars indicate a higher potential impact. The various hues are solely for visual clarity, allowing users to distinguish between distinct liquidation zones. Here are the main components of a liquidation map: Heat zones: Indicate where most positions could be eliminated if the price reaches specific levels. Liquidity pools: Collections of stop-loss and liquidation orders that can cause rapid price movements. Open interest levels: Demonstrate where large amounts of leveraged positions are concentrated. Price imbalances or gaps: Disclose areas without support or resistance, allowing prices to move swiftly. Did you know? Crypto liquidations often follow the herd; when too many traders place similar bets, liquidation maps light up and whales use them as price targets. How to use a liquidation map in your Bitcoin trading strategy A Bitcoin liquidation map provides insights into probable price movements and risk zones by visually representing places where leveraged positions will likely be closed. Here is how to use a liquidation map in Bitcoin trading: Identify high-risk zones: Identify places with dense liquidation clusters to avoid overleveraging. These areas come across as magnets, attracting price changes that might cause a series of liquidations. Time entry and exit: Liquidation clusters help find the optimal entry and exit points. Entering and exiting trades before a cluster becomes risky helps you lock in profits before reversals. Combine with technical indicators: Enhance your research by combining liquidation maps with tools such as support/resistance levels and relative strength index (RSI) . This sets out a comprehensive view of market conditions. Avoid herd mentality: Exercise caution in places with high leverage concentrations. Such zones may be traps constructed by larger players to induce liquidations and profit from the resulting volatility. Monitor whale activity: Large traders frequently target liquidation zones to turn price moves to their advantage. Observing these patterns can provide insights about prospective market movements. Anticipate reversals: Markets frequently experience reversals following large liquidation events. Recognizing these trends can aid in positioning for possible rebounds. Implement robust risk management: Use stop-loss orders and handle leverage carefully. Liquidation maps can help you determine where to put these orders to minimize exposure. Common mistakes to avoid when using the Bitcoin liquidation map Using a Bitcoin liquidation map can enhance trading decisions, but misinterpretation can lead to costly errors. Here are common mistakes you need to avoid: Blindly trading toward liquidity zones: If you are trading toward liquidity zones without thinking, expect reversals. Misreading map colors or scale : Making a mistake in judging map colors or scale can skew your risk assessment. Over-relying on liquidation data without context : Maps are valuable tools, not an assurance that what they reflect will happen. Ignoring macro news or sentiment analysis : External events often override technical signals. A sudden event may make all predictions fall flat. Always combine liquidation maps with broader technical analysis. Smart trading requires context, not just colorful charts. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-19T07:38:33.000Z,"Vitalik Buterin: Ethereum should become more friendly to users running local nodes","Vitalik Buterin posted a suggestion on making Ethereum more friendly to users running local nodes. His latest proposition is linked to attempts to scale the L1 chain, which still suffers from high gas prices and growing demand for data. Vitalik Buterin proposed changes to Ethereum aiming to make the network more friendly to users running nodes. Buterin stated it’s important to run a full node and a personal RPC server, hoping to bring more users onboard with Ethereum nodes. Currently, running a node is restricted and resource-heavy. The chain has 10,051 active nodes as of May 19. The full data of the chain is at 1,312 GB and growing. In the past year, with all active DeFi and L2 verifications, the data load for Ethereum has grown by over 20%, with a trend to preserve that pace. Ethereum nodes are still concentrated in the USA and Europe, both for the consensus and execution layer. Vitalik Buterin proposed lighter requirements for running personal RPC nodes with limited archives. | Source: Ethernodes.org The Ethereum network still hinges on data centers in developed countries, with around 30% of consensus and execution nodes located in the USA and concentrated on the East Coast. Germany is the second key location for ETH nodes. New proposal offers lighter versions of RPC nodes The bottleneck for Ethereum is also the availability of RPC providers. A smaller pool of providers may resort to censorship, as currently some RPC nodes exclude entire countries, noted Buterin in his longer explanation of eventual updates. Ethereum may add a new type of node with a lower data requirement, which could verify transactions and further decentralize the network. Some users may run partial-state nodes, storing contracts and transactions only relevant to their own use cases. The end goal is to encourage smaller players to run RPC nodes, removing the risk of monopolizing Ethereum between big players. The update on L1 scaling arrives at a time when Ethereum handles 1.38M transactions per day, following renewed interest in DeFi and ETH trading. The chain has disproven claims of being dead or displaced, leading to calls for more relevance and L1 speed. The message from Buterin failed to recover the ETH price, which dropped to $2,375.66, just days after holding above $2,500 . Vitalik Buterin puts priority status on EIP-4444 One of the steps to making Ethereum easier for node operators is to prioritize EIP-4444. The end goal is to have nodes that store full data for only 36 days. This will reduce storage requirements, one of the main obstacle to running even more nodes. The EIP-4444 changes will affect the entire network, with clients no longer serving some of the data that is older than a year through P2P transactions. Clients may locally prune historical data. Full RPC nodes will coexist with archive nodes, which have provided the large and ever-expanding history of the network. The chain has envisioned up to $1 trillion in assets, including ETH, stablecoins, tokens, and NFTs, as well as tokenized securities, requiring reliable historical nodes. On the other hand, verification and short-term transaction processing may become easier without the outsized demand for storage.

Analyst Shares Annual Return Forecast for BTC","Famous cryptocurrency analyst Willy Woo shared a remarkable analysis on Bitcoin's (BTC) annual compound return rate (CAGR). Woo noted that investors have unrealistic expectations about BTC and drew attention to the changes that have occurred over the years. Woo shared on social media, “People see BTC as an asset that rises forever. However, the real CAGR chart is obvious.” Woo, who reminded that Bitcoin's annual returns exceeded 100% in 2017, argued that this period is now behind us. Chart shared by Woo comparing the annualized rate of return on Bitcoin to the SP500. The analyst evaluated 2020 as a turning point. Stating that this year was a period when Bitcoin was adopted by institutional investors and even some states, Woo stated that with this institutionalization, the annual compound return dropped to 30-40% and this rate continued to decrease over time. Related News: Watch Out: There Are Lots of Economic Developments and Altcoin Events Coming Up This Week - Here's the Day-by-Day, Hour-by-Hour Schedule “Bitcoin is now trading as the newest macro asset of the last 150 years,” Woo said, adding that the network will see lower rates of return as it stores more capital. In the long term, the analyst, who noted that money supply growth is around 5% and global GDP growth is around 3%, predicts that Bitcoin’s annual compound return will eventually stabilize at 8%. However, Woo stated that this process could take 15-20 years, adding that BTC's performance would remain unmatched among public investment products in the long term until this period. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-19T07:30:19.000Z,"Cardano Founder Reflects On Betrayal, Plans To Step Back","In a deeply personal thread posted to X on Sunday, Cardano creator Charles Hoskinson said the past weeks’ accusations over the handling of unclaimed initial-coin-offering (ICO) funds had revealed “who [his] friends truly are” and left him determined to curtail his once-ubiquitous social-media presence. “The one advantage in a crisis or an event that tests people is that you rapidly get to see who your friends truly are and who’s fair-weather,” he wrote , adding that the absence of public support from some long-time associates “dims the light quite a bit and makes me want to dramatically alter how I engage.” He indicated that, once an independent audit of the token-sale history is published, his X account will be managed by a media team and his long-running “ask-me-anything” sessions will be reformatted. “I’ll still be at events and take the time for pictures and handshakes,” Hoskinson concluded, “but it’s different now. This one has deeply hurt me and it’s not going to heal anytime soon.” The Dispute Over Unclaimed Cardano Tokens Between September 2015 and January 2017 Cardano raised roughly $62 million by selling 25.9 billion ADA vouchers—most of them in Japan—through Tokyo-based Attain Corporation. Buyers later redeemed the vouchers inside the Daedalus wallet when the network launched. Attain ran the sale for the project’s founding entities (IOHK, now IOG; the Cardano Foundation; and EMURGO) under full KYC/AML checks, a structure highlighted in contemporary investor materials and later research from Messari. The current controversy revolves around an estimated 318–350 million ADA—about 0.2 percent of the ICO allocation—that remained unclaimed years after launch. On 7 May, NFT artist Masato Alexander alleged that Hoskinson had “effectively ERASED” the original UTXOs during the 2021 Allegra hard-fork upgrade and swept the tokens into Cardano’s reserves, later staking most of them and directing only a fraction to Intersect , the ecosystem’s new governance body. Hoskinson has rejected those claims as “lies,” insisting that 99.8 percent of the sale tokens were eventually redeemed by their rightful owners and that the remaining balance was moved—first into a custodial account and ultimately to Intersect—only after Attain’s bankruptcy left no party able to process late redemptions safely. “These funds were not stolen,” he wrote, warning Alexander and others that repetition of the accusation would trigger litigation. “If you continue to imply that IO stole funds, I will sue you. This is my last warning.” In a separate post on 13 May he explained that because the legacy on-chain redemption mechanism was insecure once Attain closed, the team “swept” the unredeemed vouchers off-chain, re-verifying claimants through local counsel and exchange partners. “The sweep reset the process and ensured all the remaining unredeemed buyers had an opportunity to go through compliance again,” Hoskinson wrote, characterising the measure as a consumer-protection step rather than a seizure. According to Hoskinson, an “externally audited report” covering every tranche of the voucher sale, each redemption transaction and the subsequent transfers of unclaimed ADA is now in its final stages. The document is to be distributed to IOG, the Cardano Foundation, EMURGO and Intersect before being released publicly. Until that review is published, he said, Cardano’s development company will make no further substantive comment and will focus on potential legal remedies against what he calls “defamation.” At press time, ADA traded at $0.7199.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-founder-betrayal-plans-to-step-back/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Cardano|ADA|ADA news|ADA Price|Cardano news|Cardano Price|Charles Hoskinson",cryptocompare

2025-05-19T07:29:35.000Z,"Bitcoin ETF weekly inflows drop 35% as Fed holds off on cuts","U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a noticeable slowdown in inflows last week, as investors adopted a risk-off stance following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s recent hawkish comments on future rate cuts. According to data from SoSoValue, Bitcoin ETFs brought in $603.74 million over the past week from May 12-16, which was a little over 35% less than the $934 million they recorded the week before. Most of last week’s inflows went into BlackRock’s IBIT, which attracted a massive $841.7 million. Meanwhile, funds like Grayscale’s BTC and VanEck’s HODL drew in more modest inflows of $39.8 million and $7.3 million, respectively. However, not all funds had a good week. Fidelity’s FBTC recorded outflows of $122.2 million, while Grayscale’s GBTC and ARK 21Shares’ ARKB lost around $70 million each. Even Bitwise’s BITB and Invesco’s BTCO recorded modest net redemptions. The other ETFs saw zero flows over the week. Despite the slower pace last week, May is still looking strong overall. So far, $2.64 billion has flowed into Bitcoin ETFs this month, not far off from April’s $2.97 billion. Since their launch in January 2024, these ETFs have now brought in over $41 billion in net inflows. Interestingly, Ethereum ETFs had a better week. The nine ETF funds recorded $41.59 million in net inflows, a solid rebound after the $38.15 million in outflows the week before. You might also like: Moody’s cuts US credit rating, Bitcoin doesn’t flinch Much of the market hesitation can be traced back to Powell’s recent remarks after the April PPI report. While producer prices unexpectedly fell 0.5%, pointing to easing inflation, Powell made it clear that the Fed won’t rush into cutting rates. He stressed the need for “sustained evidence” that inflation is cooling before making any moves. Powell also highlighted that the economic backdrop has changed, real interest rates are higher, and global risks like tariffs and supply shocks are making inflation less predictable. These concerns have led analysts to push back their expectations for rate cuts, with many now eyeing September or later as the likely window. Naturally, crypto felt the impact. The total crypto market cap is down 3.3% over the past 24 hours, now sitting at $3.35 trillion. Bitcoin ( BTC ) is hovering around $103,000, down 0.7%, while Ethereum ( ETH ) took a heavier hit, dropping 4.8% to under $2,400, a key support level. Earlier last week, sentiment had briefly turned bullish after the U.S. and China agreed to roll back tariffs for 90 days, a move seen as positive for global markets. But the optimism was short-lived. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned that the U.S. could quickly reimpose those tariffs if talks go sideways. Commenting on last week’s pullback, Ruslan Lienkha, Chief of Markets at YouHodler, told crypto.news that it was part of a natural correction within an ongoing uptrend but warned of potential risks. “The upward momentum in equity markets has moderated following the conclusion of tariff negotiations, as short-term traders began locking in profits, triggering corrective movements. This shift in sentiment has spilled over into riskier assets, including Bitcoin. As a result, the current pullback appears to be a correction within a broader medium-term uptrend. However, ongoing global economic uncertainty and persistently high interest rates in the U.S. may act as headwinds, potentially capping the upside potential of this trend.” Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at YouHodler Looking ahead, all eyes are on the May 30 release of the PCE index, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge. That data could be key in determining whether Powell stays the course or finally pivots.

2025-05-19T07:16:40.000Z,"El Salvador’s Bitcoin holdings yield over $357M in unrealized gains","El Salvador’s Bitcoin investment has yielded an unrealized profit exceeding $357 million, President Nayib Bukele revealed in a social media update. This gain comes amid Bitcoin’s recent surge, which is nearing its all-time high of $108,786. A screenshot Bukele posted on X estimated that the nation’s holdings in Bitcoin were worth more than $644.4 million, compared with the initial amount spent of $287.1 million. This translates to an unrealized profit margin of 124.4%, with $69.8 million in unrealized gains generated so far this year. 🤷🏻‍♂️ pic.twitter.com/05izbAR202 — Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) May 19, 2025 El Salvador doubles down on Bitcoin strategy despite IMF pressure El Salvador’s wallet currently holds approximately 6,181 BTC, equivalent to about $639 million at the time of reporting, based on figures from the nation’s Bitcoin office. Four years ago, El Salvador became the first country to formally adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender, as Bukele proposed, to promote financial inclusion. Since then, the country has been steadily accumulating bitcoin. Though it had agreed to rein in Bitcoin activities as part of a financing deal with the IMF (even allowing private businesses to accept Bitcoin voluntarily), Bukele remained steadfast in promoting the accumulation of Bitcoin. The agreements were quickly turned into law by the legislature in January. On X, Bukele earlier said that although El Salvador’s Bitcoin move has been heavily criticized from all corners of the world, and despite early Bitcoin advocates leaving the project, the country’s Bitcoin strategy lives on. Bitcoin rallies toward record highs The surge in El Salvador’s Bitcoin portfolio parallels Bitcoin’s broader market rally as it hovers near its all-time highs. This has been boosted by renewed enthusiasm for exchange-traded funds and changing economic indicators steering investor capital back toward riskier assets. The leading crypto rose above $105,700 on Sunday evening, extending gains made over the past two weeks. Earlier today, it reached a peak of $106,500. At present, bitcoin trades at about $102,387, according to CoinGecko. While previous rallies were often powered by retail speculation, this one unfolds amid heavy flows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, stable interest rate expectations, and renewed debate around inflation as tariffs on key imports come back into focus. Singapore-based QCP Capital wrote in a note last week that, looking ahead, they believe there is further room for digital assets to rally, especially as Coinbase’s inclusion into the S&P 500 becomes a reality in a short while. Bitcoin ETFs attract billions as inflation worries fuel rally US spot Bitcoin ETFs saw over $2.8 billion in net inflows during the first half of May, according to data from SoSoValue. The biggest single-day influx occurred on May 2, with $674.9 million flowing in. As of May 16, cumulative inflows had reached $41.77 billion, pushing total net assets above $122 billion. Broader macroeconomic conditions have also supported Bitcoin’s rally. Lingering inflation concerns, particularly as new trade policies affect supply chains, have added to Bitcoin’s attractiveness as a potential hedge—especially if inflationary pressures continue. A temporary 90-day tariff reduction deal between the US and China has offered some relief, but elevated duties remain on sectors including electric vehicles, semiconductors, and consumer electronics.

2025-05-19T07:12:08.000Z,"Ethereum Will Outperform Solana This Bull Market: Arthur Hayes","“I think Ethereum has a better performance outlook, mostly because it’s very hated,” said Arthur Hayes in an interview with Fortune on May 18. When asked about Ethereum versus Solana, he said, “Everyone thinks Ethereum does nothing, they haven’t done anything correctly, but it still has the most TVL, it still has the most number of developers, and it still is the most secure proof of stake blockchain.” Hayes did acknowledge that ETH prices have not done that well since 2020, and Solana has had a recent growth spurt, but added: “If I’m gonna deploy a fresh unit of fiat capital into the system, I think that Ethereum could outperform Solana in this next sort of 18-24 months bull run.” ETH to Outperform SOL Solana’s primary use case is meme coins , and the network did very well during that frenzy earlier this year. However, now that the bubble has burst, its activity and revenue have significantly declined. Despite all the FUD and hate, Ethereum remains the industry standard for DeFi, dApps, stablecoins, and real-world asset tokenization, having a dominant market share for each category. Looking at recent performance, Solana climbed from a low of around $100 during the April 7 crash to top out at just over $180 on May 14, before sliding back below $165, notching 80%. Ethereum has almost doubled over the same time, climbing from a bear market low of $1,400 to come just shy of $2,700 on May 14, before it retreated back below $2,400. While performance has been similar, Ethereum has done marginally better than Solana over the past six weeks, so maybe Hayes has seen this potential for future price increases. What About Bitcoin? When asked about what’s next for crypto markets, Hayes, who also admitted to having 20% of his portfolio allocated to gold, said he thought BTC dominance would continue to climb. “I think Bitcoin in this next little run could go close to $200,000, and then altcoin season comes around and we’ll see some interesting things,” he said before predicting a BTC price target of about $250,000 by the end of the year. In a recent blog post , Hayes said that pressures on the US dollar could propel BTC prices to seven figures before the end of the decade. “Foreign capital repatriation and the devaluation of the gargantuan stock of US Treasurys will be the two catalysts that will power Bitcoin to $1 million sometime between now and 2028.” The asset had dumped hard, losing more than $3,500 in a few hours as it fell below $103,000 at the time of writing.

2025-05-19T07:10:25.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Nears $102.7K Amid Golden Cross Signal and U.S. Debt Fears","Bitcoin is hovering around $102,750—down about 4% on Monday. That’s as it approaches a technically significant formation known as the golden cross . That’s when the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day average. Many people see that as a long-term bullish sign. It did, after all, precede Bitcoin’s big rally in 2023, when prices surged from $70,000 to over $100,000. Analysts are watching closely to see if history repeats itself. Bitcoin Nears Golden Cross Weeks After 'Trapping Bears' as U.S. Debt Concerns Mount https://t.co/kpJ4tIVH65 — Nature of Crypto (@AICryptoNewsNow) May 19, 2025 One reason for that interest is the state of the U.S. economy. Moody’s downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating has investors looking for alternative stores of value. With U.S. national debt topping $36 trillion and Treasury yields climbing, Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a hedge against fiscal instability. That’s a big deal. Bitcoin Outlook: Bearish Warning in BTC’s Short-Term Structure Despite all those bullish macro undercurrents, Bitcoin price prediction remains bearish as short-term structure is actually pretty fragile. On the 2-hour chart, you can see BTC breaking below its 50-EMA (around $103,698) and an ascending trendline. That’s a sign of weakening momentum. The MACD has flipped bearish too—histogram bars are deepening in the red and signal lines are diverging. That’s classic selling pressure. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Immediate support lies at $102,750. Below that, next support targets are $100,782 and $99,188. Reclaiming $103,698 and that broken trendline would shift sentiment bullish again. Resistance zones include $104,319 and $105,539. For newer traders, think of moving averages like guide rails. BTC just dipped beneath one. Until it reclaims those levels, price risks remain tilted to the downside. Seized Bitcoin Case Highlights Law Enforcement’s Reach Australian authorities seized $2.88 million in assets—including 25 Bitcoin and a luxury mansion—from a suspect linked to a 2013 crypto exchange hack. No theft charges were filed, but the court ruled for asset forfeiture under Australia’s Proceeds of Crime Act. Federal Police have swooped on a convicted computer hacker by seizing his waterfront home, luxury car and dozens of Bitcoin. This has been seven years in the making. https://t.co/VZ3A1cHvFd @_jordanquinn #7NEWS pic.twitter.com/KJ91nzu7qk — 7NEWS Queensland (@7NewsBrisbane) May 18, 2025 That case is alarming for some, but it also signals growing regulatory sophistication. For Bitcoin, it reinforces the idea that crypto is traceable and subject to legal oversight. That bolsters long-term trust among institutions—even if it causes short-term unease among privacy-focused holders. Dubai’s Crypto Push Bolsters Global Sentiment Ripple’s president praised Dubai’s proactive crypto stance during the Dubai Fintech Summit , citing its clear regulatory environment as a global benchmark. As Dubai cements its status as a leading blockchain hub, that institutional backing lends credibility to the broader crypto ecosystem—including Bitcoin. Our President @MonicaLongSF had the honor of meeting with His Highness Ahmed bin Saeed at @DubaiFintechSum . We continue to be impressed with the leadership demonstrated by Dubai as it establishes itself as one of the world’s leading hubs for digital assets. https://t.co/w9pd0cq1y7 — Ripple (@Ripple) May 14, 2025 Countries and cities providing transparent regulation attract serious capital and development. That institutional interest feeds back into market stability and could ultimately help support Bitcoin’s next leg higher. BTC Bull Token Nears $6.84M Cap as 71% Staking Yield Drives Demand As BTC holding near $102K, investor focus is shifting toward yield-generating altcoins—none more so than BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The token has now raised $5.87 million out of its $6.84 million presale goal, with a price increase looming as it enters its final funding stretch. What sets BTCBULL apart is its flexible staking model, offering an estimated 71% annual yield with no lockups or withdrawal penalties. This approach gives investors the freedom to earn passive income while maintaining full liquidity—an attractive alternative to traditional DeFi staking protocols. Key Stats: USDT Raised: $5,919,969.28/ $6,844,387 Token Price: $0.002515 Staking Pool: 1.47B BTCBULL Yield: 71% APY BTCBULL merges the viral appeal of meme tokens with the real-world utility of DeFi, making it a standout pick for those looking to capitalize on the 2025 crypto cycle. With under $1 million left before the next price tier, entry at current levels is limited—fueling urgency among retail investors seeking early access to passive yield.

2025-05-19T07:04:18.000Z,"Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Correction Coming Before Breakout to New All-Time High – Here’s His Forecast","An analyst who called the 2021 crypto market meltdown says that a significant Bitcoin ( BTC ) correction is likely to occur before new all-time highs are met. The pseudonymous trader known as Dave the Wave tells his 153,500 followers on the social media platform X that he’s expecting BTC to dip to around $90,000 before launching its next leg up, rather than a quick, parabolic ascent. The trader appears to have a rough price target of about $160,000 for BTC by around September of this year. “We all want BTC price higher here and now. But if I were a betting man, I’d say the orange not the yellow.” Source: Dave the Wave/X Citing a part of his newsletter, Dave the Wave says that BTC typically rallies extremely quickly, while it corrects in a more drawn-out fashion that drags down sentiment and puts bears offside for the big move. “These days, it seems that with every fortnight comes a new breakout in price. And this is typically the way where they say price takes the elevator up and the stairs down – price increases tend to happen rapidly, where the consolidations take place over an extended period of time… The consolidations create negative sentiment after the initial enthusiasm of the previous run-up wears off. And this is a process that takes place over time. Duration on the chart requires endurance in the trader/ investor. And of course, this is where the contrarian aspect comes into play – where most will allow the general market sentiment to affect their own, the contrarian sees instead opportunity in the way in which markets typically operate. And so the run-ups come quick and fast.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $103,105.

2025-05-19T07:00:23.000Z,"Solana’s $1,000 Path: But MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, and Bitcoin May Hit Their Targets First","While bold calls for Solana hitting $1,000 are making headlines, savvy investors are tracking a different set of assets for faster upside potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a strong candidate for early outperformance, supported by aggressive market attention. XRP is gaining traction with fresh interest post-legal clarity, and Bitcoin continues to hold macro strength with ETF flows pouring in. Avalanche (AVAX) is quietly drawing institutional exposure, adding more complexity to the evolving market landscape. 5000% ROI STILL ON THE TABLE – ACT NOW XRP: Regulatory Clarity Fuels $5.50 Forecast XRP is surging on regulatory wins, ETF speculation, and institutional adoption. Trading above $2.30, analysts predict a $5.50 target by December 2025, driven by Ripple’s cross-border payment expansion and potential ETF approvals . Technical setups suggest a breakout above $2.40 could propel XRP toward $3.40 in the short term, with long-term forecasts reaching $20 by 2030. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Surpass Expectations Every cycle has its unexpected leader, and many are now betting that MAGACOIN FINANCE might be it. Unlike many altcoins still struggling for relevance, MAGACOIN FINANCE launched with direction and intensity—securing an identity that resonates with today’s investor. Its political theme, combined with a capped supply and bold brand message, is converting market curiosity into real traction. The most compelling factor? It’s still early. Investors across Bitcoin, XRP, and Solana ecosystems are starting to take positions—not because it’s trending, but because it’s positioning itself as a rare low-entry, high-upside opportunity. With investor confidence growing daily, MAGACOIN FINANCE may be the one altcoin everyone regrets missing. Bitcoin: $140,000 in Sight Amid Institutional Surge Bitcoin remains the market anchor, trading above $100,000 and targeting $140,000 by late 2025 . Institutional inflows, ETF demand, and macro tailwinds are driving this rally, with BTC’s dominance providing a stable base for altcoin growth. Bitcoin’s projected 40% surge to $140,000 is seen as more achievable in the near term, given its institutional adoption and market maturity Avalanche Draws Fresh Institutional Capital Avalanche (AVAX) is quietly pulling in more institutional interest thanks to its scalable architecture and real-world integration efforts. Its inclusion in key partnership talks has helped AVAX maintain steady momentum as traders diversify beyond major Layer-1s. Solana: Strong Fundamentals, Longer Horizon Solana’s technical prowess in DeFi and NFTs keeps it a top Layer 1 contender, but its $1,000 target faces hurdles. Current 2025 forecasts suggest a maximum price of $258.57 , with long-term models pointing to $1,000 by 2030 . its $68 billion market cap requires unprecedented adoption to reach four figures soon. MASSIVE DEMAND, LIMITED SUPPLY – ACT NOW Conclusion Though Solana’s $1,000 projection has long-term appeal, near-term momentum is flowing elsewhere. MAGACOIN FINANCE is winning attention for its strategic setup, XRP is benefitting from growing clarity, and Bitcoin remains the market’s foundation. Together, these assets may lead before Solana completes its climb—making now a critical moment for positioning.

As a result, the Ripple price rallied to over $2.30 as optimism continued to grow. But while XRP is drawing attention, Unilabs is capturing investors’ interest with launch hype and an AI-backed approach. In just a few days, its launch has sparked a surge in demand that only a few projects ever experience. More on this ahead. Unilabs Capturing Investor Interest with $30M+ in AUM Unilabs is the world’s first AI-backed DeFi asset manager with over $30 million in Assets Under Management (AUM). It will empower retail investors with institutional-grade tools once reserved only for elite hedge funds. These tools will enable investors to monitor Ripple’s price movement, Bitcoin’s dominance, and more. While crypto giants like XRP are securing institutional interest through the XRP ETF, Unilabs is drawing attention due to a surge in demand from both retail and strategic investors. It is currently in its presale phase but has already raised over $500,000 in a short span. This protocol offers four investment funds meeting the requirements of different investors. These include the AI Fund, BTC Fund, RWA Fund, and the Mining Fund. Each fund is managed with AI-powered insights to maximize its profitability. Through this, every level of investor can start earning passive income and gain exposure to AI innovations. Apart from this, Unilabs will also reward its community through a 30% redistribution model. This means that nearly a third of the platform fees will be shared with $UNIL holders, depending on the number of tokens they hold. Source: Unilabs Just a few days after the presale launch, the platform’s multi-strategy AI engine and structured fund approach have drawn comparisons to successful products like Yearn Finance and Lido. However, Unilabs is equipped with stronger segmentation and real-time optimization. Unilabs Referral Layer Offering Real Yield Beyond Ripple Price Gains While headlines are dominated by the growing momentum behind a potential XRP ETF approval, savvy investors are looking deeper, such as Unilabs. It is attracting investors with its AI ecosystem, designed to unlock real and sustainable yields through intelligence. The best part about Unilabs is its Referral system, a powerful passive income engine. By referring other users to the Unilabs ecosystem, early backers can automatically earn rewards. This creates a self-sustaining incentive loop that benefits both the project and the early investors. XRP ETF Approval Igniting Speculations as Institutions Accumulate The approval of the first XRP ETF has shifted the narrative around Ripple from one of legal uncertainty to one of institutional confidence. Brazil is also one of the countries that has approved the first spot XRP ETF, which could increase Ripple’s price in the long run. As for Ripple’s price movement, the token is up by around 8 to 10% in the past week. Due to the increased institutional interest in the XRP ETF, the price has surged past key resistance levels and now has a clear upside target of $3.00. Source: CoinMarketCap Over the last two months, XRP whales have increased their holdings by 6%, indicating a rise in demand. Technical analysis of the Ripple price also indicates a strong buying sentiment, as shown by the moving averages on the daily chart. Despite the macro volatility, the Ripple price has remained resilient and has outperformed most Layer-1 altcoins this year. So, with the ETF flows intensifying, XRP is now mirroring the early phases of Bitcoin’s parabolic run post-ETF approval. However, even the approval of the XRP ETF is being overshadowed by Unilabs’ latest utility in identifying potential projects before they take off. Conclusion While the Ripple price still gives a good indication of how the market feels, investors are now looking for tools that help them take action, not just watch. Unilabs is doing just that by creating tools that help everyday users make better choices, including an identification tool and an early access scoring system. Early investors now have a great opportunity to buy $UNIL tokens for only $0.0051 each before the project’s value surges.

2025-05-19T06:46:10.000Z,"Altcoin Season Incoming? Top 5 Cryptos to Buy Right Now","The post Altcoin Season Incoming? Top 5 Cryptos to Buy Right Now appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin’s dominance is starting to fade , and analysts are eyeing June 2025 as a possible kickoff for the next major altcoin season. According to Michael van de Poppe, the altcoin market is still in its early stages. With the Altcoin Season Index sitting at just 25, Bitcoin remains the dominant force. But this phase, he says, is precisely when smart accumulation begins, before the retail frenzy arrives. In his latest podcast , he mentioned his top five picks that reflect a balance between safe large caps and high-upside small caps. Top Altcoins To Buy Now Chainlink (LINK): The No-Brainer Blue Chip Van de Poppe calls Chainlink a foundational piece in the crypto puzzle. As the leading oracle provider, LINK is crucial for bridging real-world data with blockchain, particularly across Ethereum, institutional use cases, and DeFi. Despite being deeply embedded in major ecosystems, LINK is still near its BTC pair lows, a signal, according to Van de Poppe, that it remains undervalued. As tokenization picks up and institutions deepen their crypto involvement, Chainlink could see a major revival in value . Aave (AAVE): DeFi’s Gateway to TradFi Aave is Van de Poppe’s second large-cap play, and he sees it as DeFi’s bridge into traditional finance. Aave already supports decentralized lending and borrowing, but its potential lies in upcoming integrations with banks and yield-generating products. Michael hints at speculative connections with political interest in blockchain adoption, adding intrigue to Aave’s role in the next financial cycle . Like LINK, AAVE has built a base and is showing early signs of an uptrend, making it a relatively low-risk, steady-growth play. Wormhole (W) For small-cap exposure, Wormhole stands out. It serves as a vital cross-chain infrastructure layer, already facilitating asset movement for giants like BlackRock and Apollo. Van de Poppe notes that Wormhole is central to the tokenized real-world asset (RWA) narrative, and with tokenized funds now launching through it, adoption is accelerating. The weekly chart shows bullish divergence, suggesting accumulation has quietly begun. He sees this as one of the few small-caps with real utility and enterprise-grade backing. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Is Ethereum $ETH Price Gearing Up for a Major Crypto Bull Run? , Peaq (PEAQ) Peaq represents Van de Poppe’s bet on Deepin, decentralized physical infrastructure, blending IoT, AI, and blockchain. It aims to build the foundation for machine-driven economies. With over 50 companies onboard and growing activity, Peaq is beginning to attract attention. Compared to early movers like Grass, he believes Peaq could offer 10x potential for investors who catch it early. Alkimi (ADS) Michael’s final pick, Alkimi, focuses on Web3 payments via an ad-based model. Despite macro pressures, ADS grew revenue from $1.2M to $5M and scaled to 10M daily transactions. With direct backing from Michael’s MN Capital Fund, ADS is well-positioned, in his view, for long-term upside. He considers the recent price drop a buying opportunity, not a red flag. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-19T06:35:08.000Z,"Coinbase impersonators steal over $2m in BTC and ETH from retired artist","Coinbase impersonators stole over $2 million worth of crypto from retired artist Ed Suman using data possibly obtained in the exchange’s recent customer support breach. According to Bloomberg, Suman, 67, was targeted in early March after receiving a text message that appeared to be from Coinbase, warning of suspicious activity on his account. When he responded, a man posing as a Coinbase security staffer called him and claimed his funds were at risk, even though they were reportedly stored offline in a hardware wallet. The caller, who identified himself as Brett Miller, seemed convincing. He knew Suman used a Trezor Model One and claimed it could still be vulnerable. Social engineering scams frequently rely on creating doubt around a user’s security, prompting them to take actions they otherwise wouldn’t. Suman was guided through what was described as a “security check,” which involved entering his seed phrase into a fake website designed to look like Coinbase’s interface. Nine days later, another impersonator claimed the earlier fix hadn’t worked and asked Suman to repeat the process, following which all of Suman’s crypto was gone, a stash that included 17.5 Bitcoin and 225 Ether, now valued at over $2 million. You might also like: Milei siblings ghost court in $4.5m LIBRA scam hearing Suman, who spent nearly two decades working on large-scale art pieces before turning to crypto investing in 2017, had stored his assets in cold storage specifically to avoid exchange-related risks. The scammers’ ability to reference details like Suman’s wallet type and holdings raised red flags about how they obtained such specific data. It now appears this attack may have been one of many that followed a broader breach at Coinbase, which the company confirmed on May 15. The breach wasn’t caused by a technical exploit but rather by social engineering. Criminals reportedly bribed third-party support contractors in India to leak sensitive customer information, including names, account balances, and transaction histories. In some cases, even partial Social Security numbers and Know Your Customer documents may have been accessed. Coinbase said the intrusion was detected through internal monitoring, but signs suggest it may have begun as early as January, months before it was disclosed. Adding to the fallout, the attackers reportedly tried to extort Coinbase for $20 million in exchange for not leaking the stolen data, a demand the company refused. Per Coinbase, less than 1% of its monthly transacting users were affected, but that still represents tens of thousands of accounts. One high-profile victim was Sequoia Capital’s managing partner, Roelof Botha, whose personal details were also reportedly compromised . The exchange is now facing an estimated $180–$400 million in costs tied to remediation and reimbursements. While Coinbase has pledged to compensate victims of scams stemming from the breach, Suman told Bloomberg he has yet to receive confirmation that he’ll be reimbursed.

2025-05-19T06:30:07.000Z,"Which Levels Must Be Broken for a Major Bull Run in Ethereum (ETH)?","Cryptocurrency analysis company MakroVision has evaluated the recent price movements of Ethereum (ETH). According to the technical analysis report published by the company, Ethereum broke the downtrend by showing a strong rise and maintains its bullish outlook in the short term. According to MakroVision’s analysis, Ethereum’s breakout above the key resistance area around $2,400 and the red falling trendline was a clear positive signal for the market. The subsequent rally is described as an impulsive “V-shaped” recovery. The declines seen so far are merely corrections and are not enough to disrupt the uptrend. The analysis indicates that the initial profit takings following the rally are technically a healthy pullback. Currently, the $2,400 level stands out as short-term support. However, if the price drops below $2,130, the current positive structure may be disrupted and a new assessment may be required.

It’s a fair question to ask as capital rotates and headlines shift from speculation to real-world use cases. Bitcoin may be cemented as the macro safe-haven, and Aptos has emerged as a speed-focused Layer 1, but a growing number of early buyers are turning their attention to something less expected—Qubetics. Qubetics ($TICS), a project that positions itself as the world’s first Web3 aggregator, is making serious noise. From its rapid presale momentum to its multi-chain design centered on interoperability, Qubetics isn’t trying to be just another smart contract platform—it aims to unify them. As it nears a $17 million presale milestone, $TICS is building credibility with those eyeing the Best Cryptos to Join This Month for near- and mid-term gains. Qubetics’ Interoperability Layer Brings Utility Across Chain Divides The core of Qubetics’ vision lies in making blockchain truly seamless. As a Web3 aggregator, Qubetics is not building a new chain to compete with Ethereum or Solana—it’s providing the infrastructure that allows them to work better together. Through its interoperability protocol, it facilitates cross-chain transactions, smart contract functionality, and asset transfers between different Layer 1 and Layer 2 ecosystems. Qubetics offers real-world application for those building multi-chain dApps, payment gateways, and enterprise tools that don’t want to be siloed on one blockchain. A developer in fintech could create a payments rail where USDC from Solana settles on Ethereum. A supply chain company could integrate data from IoTeX and validate it on Arbitrum—all routed through Qubetics’ secure interoperability layer. That’s exactly why Qubetics is increasingly discussed among the Best Cryptos to Join This Month. Its practical applications stretch far beyond DeFi, from identity verification to enterprise data sharing. Rather than being a passive infrastructure project, it serves as the connective tissue that allows Web3 to function like the internet should—without walls. Qubetics Presale ROI Puts It Among the Best Cryptos to Join This Month The Qubetics presale is already in Stage 35, and the price per $TICS token now sits at $0.2785. To date, over $17 million has been raised, more than 512 million tokens have been sold, and the project has already garnered support from a rapidly expanding community of 26,500+ token holders. With each crypto presale stage lasting exactly 7 days and a consistent 10% price increase applied weekly, Qubetics has engineered urgency without inflating its tokenomics. The tokenomics structure makes a compelling case for serious upside. Based on today’s pricing, a $100 allocation could deliver $258.95 if $TICS hits $1 post-presale. Should $TICS reach $5, that return scales to $1,694.74, and at $10, it shoots to $3,489.47. A $15 valuation—speculated by several analysts around Qubetics’ mainnet launch in Q2 2025—would represent a stunning 5,284.21% ROI from current levels. The Qubetics presale has stood out not just for the numbers, but for the transparency. Weekly price hikes, fixed timelines, and a real, product-driven narrative make it a rarity. With its growing traction, many are calling it the best crypto pre sale of the year, and one of the Best Cryptos to Join This Month without question. Bitcoin Remains Stable as Institutions Watch the Inflation Narrative Bitcoin’s role as the macro bellwether hasn’t changed. With the U.S. PPI easing to 2.4% in April and renewed hopes that rate cuts may arrive later in 2025, Bitcoin has found steady ground. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is hovering just above the $66,000 level, maintaining a consolidation range that analysts argue could precede another leg upward. What stands out now, though, isn’t just price—it’s positioning. Major asset managers are pushing for updated ETF structures, and sovereign wealth funds have reportedly begun exploring digital asset exposure. This institutional energy adds long-term tailwinds, even if short-term volatility persists. That said, Bitcoin’s upside might be comparatively modest for those seeking short-term explosive returns. It’s a reserve asset, not a growth-stage token. While it undoubtedly earns its place in any crypto allocation, especially in risk-adjusted strategies, it’s not often the leading pick when seeking the Best Cryptos to Join This Month—unless the goal is preservation, not expansion. Aptos Gains Developer Traction While Its Ecosystem Matures Aptos continues to make strides within the smart contract landscape, gaining developer adoption thanks to its unique Move programming language and parallel execution engine. It has found favor among builders seeking scalable, low-latency solutions that sidestep the congestion issues facing Ethereum and other chains. Recent months have seen new DeFi protocols go live on Aptos, alongside partnerships in NFT infrastructure and gaming. With its origins linked to the Diem project, Aptos has always attracted attention for its Meta DNA, but it’s now earning respect on merit. The uptick in ecosystem grants and validator activity is proof of rising confidence. Even so, the Aptos narrative remains in build mode. Price-wise, it has traded largely sideways, reflecting market-wide consolidation. While the chain is rapidly improving, some participants still await a breakout in usage metrics or dApp volume before ranking it among the Best Cryptos to Join This Month. Until then, Aptos holds promise—but not yet dominance. Conclusion: Qubetics Stands Tall as Utility Becomes the Deciding Factor Aptos is gaining ground, and Bitcoin continues to dominate headlines, but it’s Qubetics that introduces something uniquely vital to Web3’s progression—true interoperability. With a decentralized architecture that empowers data, tokens, and users to move freely across chains, Qubetics isn’t competing in isolation—it’s enabling everyone else to work better together. Add to that its transparent and time-sensitive presale model, a $17 million raise, and ROI figures that stretch as high as 5,284.21%, and the picture becomes clearer. The Qubetics presale is not just about entry—it’s about entry at scale. It offers one of the few remaining early-stage opportunities backed by a tangible roadmap and application. In today’s market, that’s more than rare—it’s powerful. Among all contenders, Qubetics looks poised to lead the Best Cryptos to Join This Month narrative. For those tracking emerging trends and watching where the smart money shifts next, the best crypto presale may already be happening—quietly, efficiently, and on-chain. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What makes Qubetics one of the best cryptos to join this month? Its focus on interoperability, real-world applications, and a time-sensitive presale structure make Qubetics stand out among newer projects. How much has Qubetics raised in its presale so far? Qubetics has raised over $17 million with 512 million $TICS sold across more than 26,500 accounts as of Stage 35. Why is the Qubetics presale ranked as the best crypto presale currently? Because of its capped 7-day pricing model, weekly increases, and a projected ROI that exceeds 5,200%, it has become a rare opportunity in the current cycle.

2025-05-19T06:16:29.000Z,"The Bull Case for Galaxy Digital is AI Data Centers Not Bitcoin Mining, Research Firm Says","When Galaxy Digital (GLXY) CEO Mike Novogratz bought Argos' Helios data center in late 2022 , at the depths of the post-FTX crypto winter, the company thought they were bailing out a desperate bitcoin (BTC) miner on the brink of bankruptcy. This, however, was before ChatGPT had become mainstream. Novogratz and co. had no idea that this data center would be a strategic asset as the growing Artificial Intelligence (AI) industry clamours for more data center space, thanks to the explosive growth of Large Language Models (LLMs). As analysts from Rittenhouse Research outlined in a new note , Galaxy’s lucky find, which instigated the company's move out of BTC mining altogether, might now be crypto’s most lucrative pivot, as they make the case that the infrastructure used to mine digital gold is better used to process AI algorithms, and firms that shift away from BTC mining towards AI infrastructure are set to be the next growth stocks. Analysts from Rittenhouse argue that AI data centers represent a significantly more lucrative business model than BTC mining because they generate stable, long-term cash flows with minimal ongoing capital expenditures, contrasting sharply with the volatility and capital intensity of bitcoin mining. BTC mining revenues inherently decline by approximately 50% every four years due to the scheduled halvinings . Effectively, the play for a miner is being a long-term bull on BTC's price and the ability for semiconductor fabs and designers to develop chips that are perpetually more efficient, and, for an investor, that's a lot of variables. In contrast, AI data centers like Galaxy’s Helios facility earn consistent, high-margin revenue through long-term, triple net leases to hyperscaler tenants (a large-scale cloud computing provider), without needing continuous investment in mining equipment. “Galaxy stumbled upon Helios by virtue of good luck,” Rittenhouse wrote in their note. While competitors such as Riot Platforms and Cipher Mining have publicly tried to \""rewrite history,\"" retroactively suggesting their business was always broader than BTC mining, analysts say, “in reality, these miners had zero intentions to do anything besides mine BTC until ChatGPT was launched.” A broader industry shift? Galaxy’s transition reflects a broader trend as BTC miners attempt to pivot toward AI and cloud computing. Yet, analysts underscore Galaxy’s significant advantage, stemming from its superior balance sheet ($1.8 billion of net cash and investments), successful execution record, and credibility established through the CoreWeave lease. While some have raised concerns over CoreWeave's creditworthiness, causing Galaxy's shares to trade at a significant discount, Rittenhouse analysts say these fears are significantly overblown, highlighting CoreWeave's exceptional revenue stability from long-term contracts accounting for 96% of its revenues and its strong institutional backing. The analysts emphasize that CoreWeave's debt is carefully structured through delayed draw term loans, utilized specifically to finance infrastructure directly linked to secured customer agreements, dramatically reducing default risk. Rittenhouse also notes that Galaxy has gone fully in on AI, and now doesn't have any exposure to mining. \""Galaxy has completely exited all bitcoin mining activities to focus solely on its AI data center ambitions, which sends a positive signal to potential hyperscaler tenants,\"" analysts wrote. As Rittenhouse writes, Cipher Mining’s CEO Tyler Page recently acknowledged the uphill battle miners face when approaching major AI customers. \""It’s not lost on us that if we’re talking to a counterparty with a $1 trillion market cap... One drawback for bitcoin miners is that major counterparties say, ‘wow, that’s a big obligation for you guys to backstop for such an important investment for us,’\"" Page said on the company's Q1 2025 earnings call. Galaxy doesn't have that problem. With this Helios deal in place and Novogratz's company totally out of mining, Galaxy’s accidental pivot might just turn out to be crypto’s best strategic move in years – if Rittenhouse's thesis is correct.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/19/the-bull-case-for-galaxy-digital-is-ai-data-centers-not-bitcoin-mining-research-firm-says,"BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|TRADING|RESEARCH","Markets|Crypto Mining|Galaxy Digital|GLXY|Artificial Intelligence|Mike Novogratz|Coreweave|News",cryptocompare

The team claimed to have immediately responded and taken action involving multiple departments, including the firm’s chief operating officer, Helen Liu.Other people involved in the operation were the heads of customer service, risk control, the Chinese-language division, product managers and the technical team. The exchange coordinated its actions with the user.After an internal investigation, Bybit concluded this was a “unique case affecting an individual user, not a systemic issue.” The account’s KYC information was not tampered with and the funds in the account remained secure at all times.Bybit had not answered Cointelegraph’s request for comment at the time of writing.Related: A decade-old debate is back as self-custody gets smarterThe perks of media attentionBybit claims to have taken large-scale and timely action, which involved a member of its executive team, all in response to an issue reported by a single user.

They highlighted:“This incident really made me feel the value of having influence.”EnHeng said “in this market, retail investors often lack a voice and are vulnerable.” For this reason, he said, “When we have more resources and a bigger voice, we should use them to speak up for retail investors.”Related: Self-custody vs. centralized crypto cards: Freedom or convenience?Locked out of exchangeBeing locked out of a cryptocurrency exchange account or some of its features is not excessively uncommon.

Indian cryptocurrency exchange Mudrex temporarily halted crypto withdrawals during the same month, claiming compliance improvements were the reason.Sometimes action is taken on the request of law enforcement. Last summer, a small set of Palestinian user accounts was frozen after Israeli authorities issued a seizure request. Also last summer, OKX warned it would terminate any account linked to crypto mixer Tornado Cash or sanctioned addresses, and several users said their log-ins were suddenly disabled.Those incidents echo an old adage popular in the Bitcoin (BTC) community: Not your keys, not your coins.

The Ethereum co-founder highlighted the importance of independent users running nodes, saying that a market dominated by a few Remote Procedure Call (RPC) providers risks censorship. RPC providers let wallets, users and apps interact with the blockchain without running their own nodes. Crypto wallets are usually connected to an RPC provider behind the scenes. Buterin believes there are risks to this setup. “A market structure dominated by a few RPC providers is one that will face strong pressure to deplatform or censor users. Many RPC providers already exclude entire countries,” Buterin wrote. Source: Vitalik ButerinVitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes In addition to censorship, Buterin argued that reasons like expensive fully-trustless cryptographic solutions and metadata privacy show that there’s value in ensuring greater ease for those running a personal node. In the proposal, Buterin's solution relies on a novel type of node called “partially stateless nodes.” These nodes are designed to help users maintain privacy-preserving access to blockchain data without the heavy resource demands of running a full node. As Ethereum scales and the gas limit increases, running a full node requires more storage and bandwidth. Buterin said partially stateless nodes address the issue by allowing users to verify the blockchain and serve local data, but only store a subset of the Ethereum state, based on the user’s needs.Vitalik Buterin’s graphic of partially stateless nodes. Source: Vitalik ButerinRelated: Ethereum Foundation unveils security initiative to supplant legacy systemsA new node type to validate blocks “statelessly”The nodes would operate by validating blocks statelessly. This means they don't require the storage of the full Merkle proofs or the entire blockchain history. They can selectively keep certain parts of the state up to date. This means that users could configure their nodes only to save data related to their accounts, the decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, and their commonly used tokens like stablecoins and Ether (ETH). The rest of the data will be left out, and queries beyond the stored subset will fail or be routed through an RPC solution. Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/vitalik-buterin-partially-stateless-nodes-ethereum-scaling-privacy?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-19T07:38:51.000Z,"How to read a Bitcoin liquidation map (without getting liquidated)","Understanding a Bitcoin liquidation map is imperative in dealing with the inherent volatility of the crypto market. The visual tool showcases probable liquidation levels, indicating where large orders may cause cascading price changes. This post explores how to interpret a Bitcoin liquidation map, allowing you to trade smarter in the volatile world of cryptocurrency.What is liquidation in crypto trading?In cryptocurrency trading, liquidation happens when an exchange forcefully closes a trader's leveraged position due to insufficient margin to pay losses. This usually occurs when the market moves sharply against the position. Long liquidations occur when prices fall, affecting traders who bet on an uptrend. Short liquidations happen when prices unexpectedly rise, impacting those who bet on a decline. Did you know? In crypto, a single liquidation cascade can wipe out millions in minutes, triggered not by hacking but by traders using too much leverage at the wrong time.What is a Bitcoin liquidation map?A Bitcoin liquidation map is a visual heatmap indicating price levels where large liquidations are expected to occur. These maps assist traders in identifying zones where leveraged positions may be closed forcibly if prices fluctuate sharply. Tools like CoinGlass provide real-time Bitcoin (BTC) liquidation maps, valuable resources for risk-aware traders. With the liquidation map, you canUse breakout trading strategies for profitable scalping opportunities.Set stop-loss levels based on key liquidation zones for better risk management.Target high-liquidity areas to secure profits efficiently.Enter large trades near liquidity clusters to minimize slippage and enhance execution.Analyze the gradient of liquidation intensity to anticipate potential price movements..Functioning of a liquidation map and key components The X-axis of the liquidation chart represents the bid price, while the Y-axis denotes the relative strength of liquidation activity. Each column on the graphic illustrates a liquidation cluster's relative significance compared to other clusters.The chart demonstrates how the market will respond if the price reaches certain thresholds. Taller liquidation bars indicate a higher potential impact. The various hues are solely for visual clarity, allowing users to distinguish between distinct liquidation zones.Here are the main components of a liquidation map:Heat zones: Indicate where most positions could be eliminated if the price reaches specific levels.Liquidity pools: Collections of stop-loss and liquidation orders that can cause rapid price movements.Open interest levels: Demonstrate where large amounts of leveraged positions are concentrated.Price imbalances or gaps: Disclose areas without support or resistance, allowing prices to move swiftly.Did you know? Crypto liquidations often follow the herd; when too many traders place similar bets, liquidation maps light up and whales use them as price targets.How to use a liquidation map in your Bitcoin trading strategyA Bitcoin liquidation map provides insights into probable price movements and risk zones by visually representing places where leveraged positions will likely be closed. Here is how to use a liquidation map in Bitcoin trading:Identify high-risk zones: Identify places with dense liquidation clusters to avoid overleveraging. These areas come across as magnets, attracting price changes that might cause a series of liquidations.Time entry and exit: Liquidation clusters help find the optimal entry and exit points. Entering and exiting trades before a cluster becomes risky helps you lock in profits before reversals.Combine with technical indicators: Enhance your research by combining liquidation maps with tools such as support/resistance levels and relative strength index (RSI). This sets out a comprehensive view of market conditions.Avoid herd mentality: Exercise caution in places with high leverage concentrations. Such zones may be traps constructed by larger players to induce liquidations and profit from the resulting volatility.Monitor whale activity: Large traders frequently target liquidation zones to turn price moves to their advantage. Observing these patterns can provide insights about prospective market movements.Anticipate reversals: Markets frequently experience reversals following large liquidation events. Recognizing these trends can aid in positioning for possible rebounds.Implement robust risk management: Use stop-loss orders and handle leverage carefully. Liquidation maps can help you determine where to put these orders to minimize exposure.Common mistakes to avoid when using the Bitcoin liquidation mapUsing a Bitcoin liquidation map can enhance trading decisions, but misinterpretation can lead to costly errors. Here are common mistakes you need to avoid:Blindly trading toward liquidity zones: If you are trading toward liquidity zones without thinking, expect reversals.Misreading map colors or scale: Making a mistake in judging map colors or scale can skew your risk assessment.Over-relying on liquidation data without context: Maps are valuable tools, not an assurance that what they reflect will happen.Ignoring macro news or sentiment analysis: External events often override technical signals. A sudden event may make all predictions fall flat.Always combine liquidation maps with broader technical analysis. Smart trading requires context, not just colorful charts.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Source: PACERCoinbase reported on May 15 that four days earlier it had been hit with a $20 million extortion attempt after cybercriminals bribed several of its customer support agents to access internal systems and steal a limited amount of user account data.The stolen data included names, addresses, phone numbers, emails, the last four digits of Social Security numbers, some bank account identifiers, driver’s licenses, passports and some account data, such as balance snapshots and transaction history.Bender claimed that “Coinbase failed to implement and maintain reasonable security safeguards,” which exposed users to “serious and ongoing risks.”The suit also claimed Coinbase’s response to the incident was “inadequate, fragmented, and delayed.”“Users were not promptly or fully informed of the compromise, and Coinbase did not immediately take meaningful steps to mitigate further harm,  provide identity protection services, or offer actionable guidance to affected individuals,” the complaint claimed.The lawsuit claimed users could face “substantial, immediate, and ongoing threat of identity theft and financial fraud” and that the consequences of the breach could be long-term or “potentially permanent” because the compromised information can’t be recovered or made secure once exposed.Flurry of lawsuits make similar allegations Two other lawsuits filed in a New York federal court made similar claims against Coinbase, while a fourth lawsuit added the allegation of unjust enrichment, arguing that Coinbase didn’t spend enough on data security measures.All four complaints ask for damages and other measures to help protect the plaintiff’s sensitive data.Meanwhile, a fifth lawsuit filed in a California federal court on May 15 made similar claims against Coinbase, but asked the court to order Coinbase to purge all sensitive data it holds about the plaintiffs and hire third-party security auditors to test its security systems, among other requests.A Coinbase spokesperson did not comment on the lawsuits and instead pointed Cointelegraph to a blog post it shared regarding the data breaches.Coinbase said it refused to pay the $20 million ransom and has flagged plans to reimburse users tricked into sending crypto to phishing scammers due to the data breach.In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the exchange said it expects reimbursement expenses ranging from $180 million to $400 million.Related: Retired artist loses $2M in crypto to Coinbase impersonatorThe exchange also reportedly fired a group of customer support agents based in India following their alleged involvement in social engineering attacks on users.Coinbase (COIN) shares dipped 7% and dropped to $244 after it disclosed the data breach along with an ongoing SEC probe over misstated user numbers in 2021.The stock has since staged a comeback, spiking 9% and hitting $266 by the closing bell on May 16, according to Google Finance. Coinbase has climbed even higher following the data breach.

Bitcoin developer John Carvalho introduced Bitcoin Improvement Proposal-177 on April 23, which seeks to eliminate the concept of satoshis, of which there are 100,000,000 in 1 Bitcoin (BTC), and effectively split Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million into 21 quadrillion units.It follows a 2017 proposal from Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song to create “bits,” representing one-millionth of 1 Bitcoin. However, Carvalho said Song’s approach would still require Bitcoin users to think about decimals and “shifts complexity rather than eliminating it.”Block Inc. CEO Jack Dorsey is among those calling for the change, saying in a May 18 X post that satoshis, or sats, are too confusing for newcomers.“Bits of Bitcoin is better, and just Bitcoin is best,” Dorsey said.Dorsey pointed to a December 2024 discussion on the topic where Stevie Lee, product lead of Bitcoin infrastructure firm Spiral, argued that not enough people know or care about what satoshis are.“Everyone knows Bitcoin, no one knows sats, people just want to send and receive Bitcoin,” Lee said, recalling past conversations where people thought satoshis were an entirely new token, unrelated to Bitcoin.He added that the Bitcoin community shouldn’t be too concerned with the change, as they know the underlying economics of Bitcoin would remain intact.Related: DOJ charges 12 more gamer-turned $263M Bitcoin robbersSwan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten and Byte Federal director of product Michelle Weekley were among those who opposed the change.“People understand cents in a dollar, they will understand sats in a Bitcoin,” Weekley said on X.Magdalena Gronowska, a self-described Bitcoin consultant, claimed that the change could make some people think that Bitcoin abruptly crashed from its current price of around $100,000 and that its “supply has massively inflated.”Zaprite business development lead Parker Lewis argued that sats were easier to understand.

2025-05-18T15:00:00.000Z,"Don’t believe the noise: There can never be too many L2s","Opinion by: Igor Mandrigin, co-founder and CTPO of Gateway.fmEvery couple of weeks, it seems another layer 2 rolls out, much to the chagrin of some Web3 industry commentators who are concerned about fragmentation. A recent Gemini Institutional Insights report actually noted how a new Ethereum L2 solution is launched approximately every 19 days. In response to the seemingly endless conveyor belt of new zkEVMs and optimistic rollups coming to market, the chorus of criticism continues to grow louder: “This is definitely the saturation point, no more chains are needed.”Some of the most outspoken critics of L2s argue that L2s are redundant, but this is narrow thinking. In many ways, the idea that creating new L2s should be slowed down is like arguing that there were too many websites in 1998. The proliferation of L2s is not causing the Web3 space to become overly bloated or fragmented at all. The number of chains today isn’t too many. It’s laughably few, and right now is the early innings of a multi-decade explosion in specialized, modular blockchain infrastructure.The rise of L2s is far from a passing fadWhile some contend that this L2 surge we’ve been experiencing is merely a temporary frenzy led by DeFi degenerates, it’s really an enterprise-grade infrastructure expansion, as banks (including Deutsche Bank), game studios (gaming activity on some L2 blockchains rose by over 20,000% in February 2025), logistics networks and global manufacturers get on board. Industries like banking and logistics, which are typically risk-averse, don’t make major tech pivots lightly. They do so because they have to, and in many cases, public blockchains do not meet their needs. Returning to their inherent risk-averse DNA, large enterprises and institutions in these sectors generally won’t want to build on shared, general-purpose L1s. Instead, they’ll want to deploy their own chains where they can enjoy custom performance, predictable costs, jurisdictional compliance and granular-level privacy.This focus on proprietary networks isn’t solely a Web3 thing. Let’s think about it. Did Facebook, Netflix and JPMorgan co-host on GeoCities? Of course not, so why would Web3 be any different? Shared L1s and monolithic architectures might have worked for early token experiments and composable DeFi primitives. Still, realistically, they can’t support real-world businesses’ complexity, regulatory burden or contractual requirements.The growing viability of L2sThanks to modular stacks, rollup-as-a-service platforms and breakthrough zero-knowledge proof technology, spinning up a dedicated chain is becoming increasingly viable and accessible to a wide range of enterprises across the industry spectrum. As the infrastructure improves, the cost of launching and maintaining specialized chains will also reduce, so a substantial rise in the number of L2s can be expected as time goes on.Recent: Devs introduce Ethereum R1 layer-2 scaling solutionSome onlookers will argue that this future will be convoluted for users forced to hop between chains while voicing concerns about liquidity fragmentation and the dispersal of tradable assets across multiple platforms. These are short-sighted concerns. We’re building toward seamless interoperability through shared settlement layers, trust-minimized bridges and unified account abstraction. Ultimately, the end-user won’t care whether they’re on rollup #4,318 or chain #9,072; they’ll just transact with ease and be happy with that. In the same way that cloud computing unlocked hyper scale by abstracting the hardware layer, modular blockchains are unlocking hyperscale for value transfer, asset issuance and programmable trust. Irrespective of what the doubters say, specialized L2s won’t cannibalize each other. They’ll serve different verticals, jurisdictions and use cases. There is no reason why an L2 for high-frequency trading can’t easily coexist with an L2 for national land registries.We’re not drowning in chains — we’re barely ankle-deep in the grand scheme of things. Anyone seriously betting on consolidation or some magical “winner-take-all” chain is just betting against scale and sovereignty. The real bet is hundreds of L2s and thousands of use cases as part of one modular, scalable future.Opinion by: Igor Mandrigin, co-founder and CTPO of Gateway.fm.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

He pushed for a configurable, default policy discouraging the use of Bitcoin for storing JPEGs rather than monetary data.Blockstream CEO Adam Back challenged the proposal, describing inscription filtering as an “arms race.” He noted that spam data embedded in Bitcoin transactions can be endlessly modified using code structures, requiring constant updates to filtering tools.Source: Adam BackRelated: Bitcoin Ordinals vs. Ethereum NFTs: A comparative overviewAmmous compares Bitcoin spam to emailAmmous compared the Bitcoin spam issue to email spam — another arms race society continues to fight without abandoning the system.“It’s not easy, but it’s worth trying to help bankrupt the spammers faster,” Ammous said. He argued that fighting spam is not censorship, noting that node operators already reject invalid transactions.“So a node runner looking to remove retards' spam is no less valid than retards' spam,” he added.The debate drew commentary from other users. One participant suggested Core developers treat spam-coding employees at certain startups as “unwilling QA engineers” and simply unstandardize every trick they deploy.Ammous took it further, proposing to “deprecate” the work of developers building spam tools and even hiring outside coders to overwhelm their systems.Source: Saifedean AmmousThe conversation reflects ongoing tensions in the Bitcoin community over the network’s intended use. With inscriptions continuing to congest the network, calls for technical countermeasures — and pointed critiques of those defending spam — are growing louder.In a Feb. 4 report, Mempool Research said the adoption of inscriptions could drive the Bitcoin network’s average block size as high as 4 megabytes (MB) per block, far higher than current averages.Bitcoin’s average block size — the amount of data in each block posted to the network’s public ledger — is currently around 1.5 MB.Magazine: Arthur Hayes $1M Bitcoin tip, altcoins’ powerful rally’ looms: Hodler’s Digest, May 11 – 17",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/saifedean-ammous-funds-dev-to-fight-bitcoin-spam?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-17T15:21:23.000Z,"A Bitcoiner’s guide to South Africa’s Garden Route","South Africa’s Garden Route, famed for its lush forests, expansive beaches and charming towns, has become a testbed for Bitcoin adoption.From Mossel Bay to Witsand and Plettenberg Bay to Knysna, Bitcoin has become popular among shop owners and travelers alike for a multitude of reasons.“We’re seeing the early signs of a parallel, permissionless economy emerging across an entire region,” James Caw, founder of SimplB — a local crypto asset provider — told Cointelegraph, “where small businesses benefit from faster, lower-cost digital payments and where people have more options to earn, send and receive sound money securely.”For tourists, the benefits are immediate: no currency exchange hassles, no international card fees, and the ability to pay instantly and securely. For locals, Bitcoin (BTC) offers a hedge against inflation, protection from currency volatility and new economic opportunities.Here’s a taste of what a Bitcoin-friendly trip along the Garden Route is like.The Garden Route is where Bitcoin meets paradiseThe Garden Route is one of South Africa’s premier tourist corridors. It stretches roughly 300 kilometers from Mossel Bay in the west to the Storms River Mouth in the east, attracting hundreds of thousands of tourists yearly.Crypto adoption is escalating thanks to South Africa’s regulatory environment, which now recognizes Bitcoin as a financial product. Across the Garden Route, you can spend pre-acquired Bitcoin freely, with little concern for local tax or exchange controls.It’s a grassroots movement. Towns like Witsand and Plettenberg Bay are at the forefront, and national retailers like Pick n Pay provide a safety net for crypto spending along the way. Every Pick n Pay store, including supermarkets, clothing outlets and Express convenience stores, accepts Bitcoin via the CryptoQR app. This guarantees you can always buy daily goods with Bitcoin wherever you travel. Related: Stablecoin fever: 5 major stablecoins are growing crypto adoptionWitsand is the Bitcoin villageLocated at the mouth of the Breede River, Witsand is a sleepy coastal town with a big reputation in the Bitcoin world. Here, Bitcoin isn’t just accepted — it’s preferred.It’s thanks to the efforts of local champions like Edwin Jones, a software engineer and passionate supporter of Bitcoin adoption in the Garden Route. Witsand has become a functioning Bitcoin circular economy. Accommodation options like Fantasea and Happy Days holiday homes, meals at Ellie’s on Main, groceries at local shops, gym memberships, boat services, petrol, surf lessons and mini-golf can be paid for using Bitcoin.As Jones notes: Bitcoin Witsand existed long before we gave it a name. It was just having conversations with friends, and as the local businesses started understanding Bitcoin, they actually demanded we start getting the technology in place.The town’s small and close-knit community has enabled rapid adoption; more than 45 establishments accept Bitcoin as of early 2025. The town’s enthusiasm is infectious, as locals and visitors enjoy the ease and security of digital payments.Witsand proudly announces its acceptance of Bitcoin. Source: Edwin JonesWitsand’s success as a Bitcoin hub is rooted in its community-driven approach. Jones outlines its growth by outlining that: Although there have been many individual businesses over the years since 2009 that started and stopped accepting Bitcoin for the Garden Route, the adoption really started kicking off in 2021.“With the Lightning Network starting to reach maturity around that time, the first Spaza Shop in Mossel Bay, Bitcoin Ekasi, started accepting Bitcoin in August 2021, and the first restaurant in Witsand in December of the same year.”Education has been central to the process. Local advocates have focused on teaching business owners the fundamentals of Bitcoin, warning against scams and emphasizing the difference between Bitcoin and speculative altcoins. “With all the circular economies advocating against gambling and trading, cautioning against interest and investments, being explicitly Bitcoin, and focusing on the fundamentals rather than the price, scammers have been kept at bay,” Jones said. “We have also found that businesses don’t have to adapt as much as evolve.”Bitcoin doesn’t change a business — it just supercharges it. Doing the same old things, much better.Mossel Bay’s surf and social upliftmentMossel Bay, the historical gateway to the Garden Route, is not just about beaches and maritime history. Mossel Bay is home to Bitcoin Ekasi, a pioneering project that brought Bitcoin to the township of JCC Camp.Bitcoin Ekasi empowers unbanked residents by enabling them to earn and spend Bitcoin locally. Coaches at The Surfer Kids nonprofit are paid in Bitcoin, and local spaza shops accept Bitcoin for daily necessities.For the Bitcoiner tourist, Mossel Bay offers a unique opportunity for “conscious crypto-tourism.” You can take surf lessons from instructors paid in Bitcoin, visit the Bitcoin Ekasi education center, or support the project with direct donations.The town also boasts a Pick n Pay that accepts Bitcoin. As SimplB’s Caw observes: The Bitcoin Ekasi project first started when they began accepting Bitcoin because of the demand from foreign tourists visiting Mossel Bay. It is just so simple to function on a Bitcoin standard once you begin using it.Plettenberg Bay is the fastest-growing Bitcoin economyFurther east, Plettenberg Bay has witnessed an explosion in Bitcoin adoption. In just a few months, the number of Bitcoin-accepting merchants jumped from five to more than 75, making it one of Africa’s most dynamic crypto economies.Confirmed acceptors include Ferris Cars (which facilitates rental accommodation payments in crypto), Glow Lighting Design and all local Pick n Pay branches. Adventure tourism companies, boutique retailers and professional services are increasingly receptive to Bitcoin, especially if you ask. The rapid growth suggests an enthusiastic local scene, with businesses eager to tap into the spending power of Bitcoin tourists.Related: 8 major crypto firms announce US expansion this yearPlettenberg Bay offers a vibrant mix of beach life, nature and crypto-friendly commerce. The town’s energy is palpable, and visitors are encouraged to engage with merchants, share information about Lightning payments, and help grow the ecosystem.“Right now Plettenberg Bay is by far the most interesting circular economy in Africa and possibly the world,” said Jones. “It currently boasts having the most businesses accepting Bitcoin of any town in Africa and has achieved this in less than three months.”Bitcoin preferred signs can be found along the Garden Route. Source: Edwin JonesSedgefield is a quiet pioneerSedgefield, a tranquil town between Knysna and Wilderness, played a key role in the national rollout of Bitcoin payments at Pick n Pay. It was one of the trial sites for the innovative QR code converter from MoneyBadger, which enables Bitcoin spending at every Pick n Pay in South Africa.Sedgefield itself doesn’t have the same density of Bitcoin-accepting independent merchants as Witsand or Plettenberg Bay, but the presence of Pick n Pay ensures that crypto tourists can always pay for groceries and essentials with sats.Practical information for your tripIf you do make it out to the Garden Route, recommended wallets include Blink, Wallet of Satoshi and Phoenix — all Lightning-enabled and widely used in the region. In larger towns like Knysna, George, Wilderness and Oudtshoorn, the Bitcoin scene is still emerging. There aren’t yet established circular economies, but the nationwide acceptance of Bitcoin at Pick n Pay provides a reliable foundation for spending.The Spasie on Breede Restaurant and Bar is just one of many establishments accepting Bitcoin. Source: Edwin JonesBTC Map occasionally lists independent merchants, like Beans About Coffee in Oudtshoorn. Still, the best strategy is to ask around, look for Bitcoin signage, and use mapping tools to discover new acceptors.For accommodation, activities and dining, direct inquiry remains key. Many guesthouses and tour operators are open to Bitcoin payments, especially as awareness grows. Online platforms like Bitrefill enable you to buy gift vouchers for major retailers using Bitcoin, providing a workaround for places that don’t yet accept crypto directly.Happy travels.Magazine: Pranksy: Inside the anonymous life of an NFT legend — NFT Collector",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoiners-guide-south-africa-garden-route?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-17T15:00:00.000Z,"The DeFi mullet — Fintech needs DeFi in the back","Opinion by: Merlin Egalite, co-founder at Morpho LabsFintechs in the front, decentralized finance (DeFi) in the back: the DeFi Mullet.Today’s fintech companies offer excellent user experiences but are constrained by traditional financial infrastructure — siloed, slow, expensive and inflexible. Meanwhile, DeFi provides lightning-fast, cost-effective, interoperable infrastructure but lacks mainstream accessibility.The solution? Combine fintech’s distribution and user experience with DeFi’s efficient back end.The mullet is inevitableFintech companies heavily rely on traditional financial (TradFi) infrastructure that is siloed, slow to deploy and run, and costly to maintain. This inefficiency limits their control over costs and product offerings and has potential infrastructure risks. Fintechs have a strong incentive to transition to building on autonomous, credibly neutral public infrastructure.The power of DeFi is evident in stablecoins. While traditional international wire transfers cost $30–$50 and take one to five business days, stablecoin transfers cost mere cents and settle in seconds. This revolutionary improvement in financial infrastructure extends beyond payments. DeFi provides 24/7/365 infrastructure for trading, lending and borrowing with instant settlement, open access and deep liquidity, enabling better price execution and yields.Plugging their compliance-ready front end into DeFi infrastructure, fintech companies can focus on creating exceptional user experiences. This opens up tremendous opportunities for innovation while driving more liquidity onchain, creating a positive feedback loop of embracing the DeFi Mullet.Now is the time for mainstream adoptionToday’s DeFi ecosystem has proven its reliability for fintech integration. There are dozens of protocols that demonstrate this maturity, securely managing billions in loans through immutable, governance-minimized designs. DeFi infrastructure gives fintechs complete control over their infrastructure. This is particularly crucial after the recent Synapse bankruptcy that trapped Yotta user funds meant to be insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.Recent: Bitcoin DeFi will have 300M users, beating Ethereum and Solana: ExecInstitutions are also coming onchain. BlackRock has tokenized a fund via Securitize; Stripe has acquired Bridge for $1 billion to scale its stablecoin solutions; the US is creating a strategic Bitcoin (BTC) reserve; and clarity on regulation is opening the floodgates. The shift is step-by-step but tangible.DeFi has arrived.The next phaseFor years to come, expect more products like crypto-backed loans to be released by fintech’s most advanced players, offering onchain saving accounts, onchain loans, instant international payments and more. This transformation will be invisible to users and powered by smart wallets and account abstraction that maintain the familiar Web2-like user experience at which fintech companies excel. Early adopters will gain significant advantages over competitors.Yet, unlike building on traditional finance, DeFi’s open infrastructure means even latecomers can benefit from existing network effects without starting from zero.Some skeptics argue that the involvement of fintechs and traditional institutions will erode decentralization, as protocols must comply with regulatory requirements. While this concern is understandable, the opposite is more likely.Expecting protocols to achieve compliance across every jurisdiction worldwide is unrealistic, especially given the vast regulatory fragmentation. Instead, regulating the apps that interface with users makes far more sense rather than the underlying protocols. For this regulatory model to work, however, protocols must remain credibly neutral.A credibly neutral mechanism adheres to four principles:It embeds no preference for specific individuals or outcomes.It is open-source with publicly verifiable execution.It is simple and understandable.It changes infrequently.Examples like HTTP and SMTP demonstrate the power of credibly neutral protocols — they are free, open and unregulated, with only the clients subject to oversight. The same logic should apply to governance-minimized, immutable DeFi protocols.These constraints will push DeFi builders toward creating genuinely decentralized and trustless systems.Fintechs integrating DeFi protocols can build on top of the most neutral infrastructure and access their growing network effects.Let the mullet growThe DeFi mullet is more than just a meme — it’s a structural shift.To scale, DeFi must meet users where they are: through regulated, user-friendly fintech channels. For fintechs to stay relevant, they must offer their customers the best user experience and opportunities, such as the best rates. Those who miss this opportunity risk falling into irrelevance, much like traditional retail banks losing market share to today’s fintechs.This convergence isn’t just possible — it’s inevitable.Opinion by: Merlin Egalite, co-founder at Morpho Labs.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-17T12:09:46.000Z,"Bitcoin to $250K in 2025 ‘totally possible’ — crypto analyst Scott Melker","Bitcoin’s next explosive move could send the asset to $250,000 by the end of 2025, according to Scott Melker, a crypto analyst and host of The Wolf of All Streets podcast.Speaking in a recent interview, Melker cited growing institutional interest and diminishing volatility as key factors that could drive the next leg up.“250K this year, totally possible,” Melker said, adding that Bitcoin (BTC)’s volatility has declined significantly in recent years.“It used to be about three times as volatile as the S&P. Now it’s less than two times.” He pointed to increased involvement from pension funds and ETF issuers as evidence of a more mature, stable market.The shift, he argued, reflects a broader trend of institutional adoption. “The more institutional money, the more Wall Street money, the more long-term holders get involved, the less volatility there’s going to be,” Melker explained.Related: New Bitcoin price all-time highs could occur in MayCrypto markets show signs of strength in 2025Market activity in 2025 has already shown signs of strength. Bitcoin surged past $104,000, while Ether (ETH) reclaimed levels above $2,600.Coinbase’s addition to the S&P 500 marked a major milestone for crypto’s integration into mainstream finance. Melker noted the company is not just entering the index but doing so in the top 50 by market cap — a reflection of how deeply rooted some crypto firms have become.In addition to Coinbase, firms like Galaxy Digital and eToro have moved forward with public listings, signaling confidence in regulatory conditions under the current US administration.Melker said that this environment, bolstered by dropped SEC lawsuits and favorable executive orders, has created what he calls “an extremely bullish” backdrop for the sector.While Bitcoin remains the primary focus, Melker acknowledged a renewed interest in altcoins. Recent price action saw Ethereum outpace Bitcoin, triggering a rally across smaller-cap tokens — a sign, he said, that “new money” is entering the space rather than just rotating within it.Related: Here is why Bitcoin price is stuck below $105KDon’t rule out a wild runDespite the optimism, Melker tempered expectations, noting that most experts are forecasting cycle highs between $120,000 and $150,000. Still, he emphasized that wild surges are not out of the ordinary in crypto.“From the 2020 lows to the last bull market, Bitcoin went from $3,000 to $69,000.

2025-05-17T09:12:28.000Z,"Everstake defends non-custodial staking as SEC weighs industry input","The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has held discussions with Everstake, one of the largest non-custodial staking providers globally, to explore clearer regulatory definitions around staking in blockchain networks.The meeting, which also involved the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, comes at a time when over $193 billion in digital assets are staked across major proof-of-stake (PoS) networks.However, despite the massive scale of participation, staking remains in a legal gray zone in the US as regulators wrestle with its classification under existing securities law.The previous SEC administration also took enforcement actions against major players such as Kraken, Coinbase, and Consensys due to their staking services. The agency, under pro-crypto President Donald Trump, has recently dismissed these enforcement actions.During the meeting, Everstake told the SEC that non-custodial staking should not be classified as a securities transaction. The company said that users maintain full control over their digital assets throughout the staking process and do not transfer ownership to a third party.They argued that this makes staking a technical function, not an investment product.“Our main assertion is that staking is not a financial instrument or security transaction, but rather a technical process, a base-layer protocol mechanism—akin to an oracle in a database—that maintains the integrity and functionality of decentralized networks,” Everstake founder Sergii Vasylchuk told Cointelegraph.Everstake team meeting with the SEC. Source: EverstakeRelated: SEC delays staking decision for Grayscale ETH ETFsEverstake calls for regulatory clarityIn a letter submitted to the SEC’s Crypto Task Force on April 8, 2025, Everstake asked the agency to extend regulatory clarity to non-custodial staking and custodial and liquid staking models.In the letter, which came in respond to Commissioner Hester Peirce’s call for input on regulatory treatment of blockchain services, Everstake argued that non-custodial staking should not be considered a securities offering.It claimed that non-custodial staking, where users retain control of their tokens, does not involve the pooling of assets or the expectation of profits from managerial efforts.In its model, Everstake said users delegate only validation rights while maintaining ownership of their digital assets. The staking rewards are algorithmically distributed by the blockchain network itself, and the firm merely provides technical infrastructure.Related: Ethereum ETF staking will have little impact without multimonth rally: AnalystNon-custodial staking fails the Howey testThe letter also details why non-custodial staking fails each prong of the Howey test. Users do not make an investment of money in a common enterprise, do not expect profits from Everstake’s efforts, and are not dependent on the company’s management for financial returns.Instead, any rewards come from network-level incentives and fluctuate with the market value of the underlying asset.Everstake proposes specific criteria that should exempt non-custodial staking from securities classification. These include user asset control, absence of pooled funds, permissionless unstaking, and the provision of purely technical services.It likens non-custodial staking to proof-of-work mining, which the SEC has previously ruled out as a securities transaction.Margaret Rosenfeld, Everstake’s chief legal officer, also told Cointelegraph that “with non-custodial staking, there’s no handover of assets, no investment contract, and no third-party risk.” She added:“Treating it as a securities offering undermines the decentralized model and risks chilling innovation in the blockchain sector.”Nevertheless, the SEC has so far withheld a definitive stance. Rosenfeld said that the agency did not make any “specific commitments” on staking guidance. However, it continues to listen to industry stakeholders.“The Task Force is actively engaging with a range of stakeholders—including those involved with non-custodial staking, ETFs, and broader blockchain infrastructure—to gather input.”In an April 30 letter to the SEC, nearly 30 crypto advocate groups led by the lobby group the Crypto Council for Innovation (CCI) asked the agency for clear regulatory guidance on crypto staking and staking services.Magazine: Binance Wallet ‘killing’ MetaMask and airdrops, Chinese RWA tokens: Asia Express",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/everstake-defends-non-everstake-sec-non-custodial-staking-guidance-staking-as-sec-weighs-industry-input?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-17T00:57:29.000Z,"Bitcoin bull flag and standard profit taking hint at eventual rally to new BTC price highs","Key takeaways: Traders expect a Bitcoin price pullback to $90,000, but a bull flag could break out to new highs if profit taking near the range highs reduces. On-chain data suggests the current profit taking is too weak to extinguish Bitcoin’s current price momentum. Bitcoin (BTC) price has spent the bulk of the week pinned below $104,000 to $105,000, which many analysts have labelled as a resistance zone, but an alternative view suggests that BTC is simply consolidating within a bull flag. A bull flag is a continuation pattern that is characterized by a period of sideways price action following a sharp uptrend, and when the structure confirms or breaks from the trendline resistance, the uptrend continues. BTC/USDT 1-day chart. Source: TRDR.ioWhile the range-bound trading portion of the flag is said to represent indecision from buyers and sellers, in this scenario, the absence of buy volume is the primary culprit. As shown in the TRDR.io chart below, Bitcoin’s explosive move to $105,900 from $74,400 was accompanied by large liquidations in the margin markets and robust spot volumes, which aligned with several days of billion-dollar spot BTC ETF inflows. BTC/USDT 1hr chart. Source: TRDR.ioDuring this three-week period, several US-based and international companies also announced plans to purchase Bitcoin and establish BTC treasuries. The spot and futures cumulative volume delta, along with the open interest metric on the chart show traders selling near the range highs and the absence of new long leverage and significantly sized spot positions being opened in this area, whereas drops to range low (bull flag support) sees bids filled on the spot side, but there is still limited use of margin for fresh longs. BTC/USD spot and margin CVD. Source: TRDR.ioBitcoin’s recent cool-down phase is a normal outcome after the near 40% recovery that started on April 8, and the loss of upward momentum resulting from profit-taking in futures markets near the current range high is also to be expected. Bitcoin short-term holder supply profit and loss data from Glassnode supports this view, as shown in the chart below. The onchain data company highlighted profit taking for short-term traders but explained that it does not exceed the statistical norm, leaving room for further price upside. “Recently, the magnitude of STH Realized Profit has surged to almost +3 standard deviations above its 90-day average, reflecting a notable uptick in profit realization. In past cycles, particularly during rallies towards the ATH, this metric has historically climbed to over +5 standard deviations of more.

This has additional benefits for data transmission in space, Belcher said.“The architecture is well-suited to space because it reduces delays, compensates for data corruption caused by radiation, and enables cryptographic verification to ensure data has not been tampered with,” she said.The foundation is a nonprofit governing the decentralized cloud storage protocol Filecoin (FIL), which uses the IPFS web protocol to store data. Lockheed Martin is one of the world’s largest aerospace companies.Source: Filecoin FoundationDecentralized storage benefits“There’s a multi-second delay from the Moon and a multi-minute delay from Mars,” Belcher said.“With IPFS, you look for a content ID and retrieve the data from wherever is closest — your own device, a nearby satellite, or a lunar station.”Additionally, the IPFS uses a distributed architecture to store multiple copies of data across a global network, reducing reliance on centralized data centers.These multiple copies of data improve reliability in environments where hardware is prone to degradation, helping to ensure the integrity of sensitive materials such as satellite images, according to Belcher.Interest in decentralized archival storage is growing among media companies, and the Foundation is also exploring potential military applications of this technology, Belcher said.“It could be really powerful for media in general to have that deep archive and also the ability to have your records everywhere all over the world when needed,” she said.The FIL token is a utility token that can be used within the Filecoin ecosystem.

According to Bloomberg, the tokens representing Galaxy Digital’s shares could be used in decentralized finance applications, like borrowing or lending.Galaxy is among several crypto companies looking to access the US markets under a friendlier regulatory regime in the country. Companies that are also exploring or working on a US listing include Metaplanet, Circle, Kraken, and Gemini.

Data from RWA.xyz shows the sector's market cap at $22.5 billion — a fraction of both global real-world asset values and major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC). However, it’s growing fast, with a 111.8% increase over the past year.One rising trend is tokenizing securities, essentially turning assets like stocks and treasury bonds into tradable tokens on the blockchain. Robinhood is considering building a blockchain that would allow retail investors in Europe to trade tokenized US securities like stocks. Galaxy Digital has plans to tokenize everything from stocks and fixed income to ETFs.At the SEC’s crypto roundtable on May 12, Chair Paul Atkins compared the tokenization of assets to the music industry moving from analog to digital, which, according to Atkins, greatly benefited the American economy.The closer relationships that US President Donald Trump has developed with the industry have sparked new enthusiasm for crypto activity in the country. In addition to the flurry of companies preparing for a US public listing, some other crypto companies have announced their reentry into the local market.

An Abu Dhabi-based investment firm announced in May that it would use the stablecoin to settle a $2-billion investment in Binance, a crypto exchange that had previously been the target of an investigation by US authorities. “WLFI’s financial entanglements with the President, his family, and the Trump Administration present unprecedented conflicts of interest and national security risks, including potential violations of the foreign emoluments clause,” Blumenthal wrote in a May 6 letter to Witkoff. Related: What are the next steps for the US stablecoin bill?Some Democrats have called for clarification within the GENIUS Act to ensure that Trump was not able to personally profit from stablecoins whose legislation he may have influenced and then have the opportunity to sign into law. However, as of May 16, it was unclear whether any future vote on the bill would address these concerns. Cointelegraph reached out to Sen.
