2025-06-08T00:30:18,"Bitcoin Historical Data Points To Imminent 62% Price Surge – Analyst","The Bitcoin market was recently subject to a significant price dip as a public feud between US President Donald Trump and the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, on Thursday negatively impacted the US financial markets. During this period, the premier cryptocurrency crashed by an estimated 5% from $106,000 to trade below $101,000. Interestingly, despite the short-term volatility, several key technical indicators now point to a potentially bullish setup. In fact, this latest pullback appears to complete a series of signals that historically precede major price rallies.

Bitcoin Set For Price Surge, First Target At $130,000 In an X post on June 6, a market expert with X username CrypFlow shares a bullish Bitcoin prediction amidst an ongoing price correction. Aside from sharp price decline in the past week, the BTC market has witnessed a steady price correction since the premier cryptocurrency achieved a new-all time high of $111,970 on May 22. However, CrypFlow states that this price retracement alongside a host of other technical indicators suggest that Bitcoin is setting to repeat its price rally from Q4 2024. The first indicator observed by the analyst in the chart above is the golden cross which occurs when the 50-day simple moving average (50SMA) crosses above the 200-day simple moving average (200SMA) in early June 2025. The golden cross is a common bullish indicator that signals a shift in market momentum and was last seen in November 2024. Furthermore, there is a Bitcoin price breakout above a long-standing purple downward trendline that originated in December 2024. This breakout also mirrors another move seen in early November 2024, when BTC breached the descending resistance that began in March 2024. The ongoing price correction represents the final indicator as Bitcoin also suffered an estimated 10% price fall in November falling from $74,500 to $68,500 before initially an explosive price rally. CrypFlow’s analysis suggests that if Bitcoin is repeating its price rally from Q4 2024, the premier cryptocurrency could produce a 62% price gain translating into potential targets around $170,000. However, the analyst has set a more conservative initial price target of $130,000, representing a 25% gain from current market levels.

According to data from prediction site Coincodex, the general BTC market sentiment remains bullish despite a Fear & Greed Index of 45 which indicates Fear. The Coincodex analyst team are backing this market’s positivity with a price projection of $134,074 in five days and $155,864 in three months.

2025-06-07T23:30:29,"Solana Price Gears Up For Breakout After Volatility Squeeze","Solana (SOL) is showing signs of a potential breakout on the 15-minute chart, as price action contracts into a tighter range. This volatility squeeze precedes a significant move, with market participants awaiting confirmation of direction. The consolidation phase has formed a recognizable breakout structure, with highs and lows converging, suggesting that pressure is building beneath the surface. Breakout Structure Taking Shape On Lower Timeframe According to Andrew Davis’s post on X, Solana experienced a sharp sell-off that briefly pushed the price below $142. However, the cryptocurrency quickly bounced back, demonstrating strong buying interest and resilience. SOL has climbed back above the $150 mark, showing signs of building strength and momentum. This recovery suggests that the market is absorbing selling pressure. If this upward momentum continues, SOL could be poised for further gains. Crypto analyst Gemxbt noted that Solana exhibits a descending triangle pattern on the 1-hour chart, which is typically regarded as a bearish continuation signal. A descending triangle pattern has formed as the price creates lower highs while holding a relatively flat support zone at $145, a key level that has been defended multiple times. Despite the generally bearish structure, the chart has shown a bounce off this support, suggesting a temporary reversal. On the upside, resistance near $155 remains a crucial hurdle. For SOL to confirm a sustained reversal, it would need a breakout above this level, potentially signaling a shift in market sentiment . Further supporting the idea of a potential reversal, technical indicators are reflecting oversold conditions, which hint that the selling pressure may be exhausted, increasing the likelihood of a short-term recovery. Giottus Crypto Exchange also shared insights on Solana price structure, identifying a bullish Shark harmonic pattern emerging on the 4-hour chart. He analyzes that Point D of the Shark pattern has aligned with the 1.618 BC Fibonacci extension, landing at the $147 level. This area is considered a potential reversal zone. The presence of this harmonic pattern at a critical extension, combined with price action, indicates that a bullish reversal could be underway. If the pattern holds, upside targets are projected in the $180 to $190 range. Solana Tests Wedge Resistance As Bulls Eye Breakout SOL’s anticipated upward move seems highly likely. Whales_Crypto_Trading also outlines that Solana is showing signs of a breakout as it approaches the upper boundary of a broadening wedge formation on the 4-hour chart. A pattern characterized by diverging trendlines often indicates increasing volatility and uncertainty, but also tends to precede explosive price action once a breakout occurs. SOL is consolidating beneath the wedge’s resistance, with price action tightening and volume beginning to show signs of building, which could trigger a wave of bullish momentum toward targets at $215, $228, $243, and $265.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/solana-gears-up-for-breakout/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Solana|Andrew Davis|Broadening Wedge Pattern|Bullish Shark Harmonic Pattern|Descending Triangle Pattern|Fibonacci Extension|GemXBT|Giottus Crypto Exchange|SOL|SOL news|SOL price|solana|Solana news|Solana price|solusd|SOLUSDT|Whales_Crypto_Trading",cryptocompare

According to the settlement administrator, the distribution of settlement payments has now begun and will continue over the next several weeks. The 2021 cyberattack compromised the personal data of a staggering 76 million US customers, exposing names, addresses, Social Security numbers, and other sensitive information. T-Mobile agreed to the settlement in July of 2022 to resolve claims from the August 2021 breach. Customers eligible for payments will receive a digital deposit or paper check based on their selection during the claim process, with amounts ranging from $25 to $100, with some eligible for up to $25,000 for substantial documented losses. The settlement also includes two years of free identity protection services for affected customers. The breach, one of the largest in U.S. history, prompted lawsuits accusing T-Mobile of failing to secure customer data. T-Mobile says it has since enhanced its cybersecurity protocols to prevent future incidents, and the company did not admit to any wrongdoing in the settlement.

2025-06-07T23:00:45,"Crypto Analyst Says This Bitcoin Top Signal Hasn’t Gone Off Yet — What To Know","The story has been somewhat the same for the price of Bitcoin over the past week, drifting further from its recently-notched all-time high of $111,814. On Friday, June 6, the premier cryptocurrency fell towards the $101,000 level, reflecting an uptick in the market volatility over the past few days. While the Bitcoin price has quickly recovered from this sudden downturn, there is still real concern about the market leader’s performance since reaching its record-high value. However, a new indicator suggests that the price of BTC might still have some time to run up to a new high. Analyst Predicts Four Months Of Opportunity For BTC In a recent post on the X platform, crypto expert Joao Wedson revealed that there might still be some degree of opportunity in the Bitcoin market. This observation is based on a model, which was accurate in predicting past all-time high prices for the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Related Reading: Traders Turn Bearish on Bitcoin Following High-Profile Political Tensions, Data Shows This revelation is based on the Max Intersect SMA Model (the blue line), which has accurately identified the tops of past Bitcoin cycles. According to Wedson’s post, this cycle top prediction model suggests that the price of BTC could still have around four months of upward growth potential — regardless of the volatility and market shakeout. As seen in the chart above, the price of Bitcoin reaches its current cycle peak whenever the Max Intersect SMA (simple moving average) hits the previous cycle top. In the 2021 cycle, the top prediction model hit the 2018 high of around $19,000 in November 2021, culminating in a then-all-time high of $69,000. Hence, when this Max Intersect SMA hits exactly $69,000 — the price top in the last cycle, that will represent the peak of this current cycle. Wedson also asserted that this model is pretty reliable, as it is backed by 200 tested algorithms. With this top prediction model still a bit off $69,000, the Bitcoin price might still be some months away from its peak. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As mentioned earlier, the price of BTC seems to be struggling after recently hitting its current all-time high above the $110,000 mark. This week’s performance must have tested investors’ patience as the flagship cryptocurrency mostly traded within a consolidation range.

This analysis investigates how their disagreement, particularly surrounding the 'Big Beautiful Bill', has inadvertently acted as a promotional blitz for Bitcoin, while also benefiting two lesser-known altcoins. Bitcoin's Price Rally Amidst Tech Titans' Tussle Amidst the unfolding drama, Bitcoin has shown remarkable resilience and is currently trading between $102,410 and $110,000. The cryptocurrency seems poised for further gains, with potential targets pegged at around $121,600. Source: TradingView The support levels near $99,000 and the close proximity of the 10-day and 100-day price averages suggest a stable upward trajectory. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates that Bitcoin isn't yet overbought, which aligns with a bullish outlook for the near future. The Rally of Ethereum and Its Market Dynamics Ethereum, another major player in the cryptocurrency market, has also seen a notable uptick. The current pricing dynamics reveal a bullish trend, with the cryptocurrency trading between $2410 and $2729.90. Source: TradingView Despite a slight dip this past week, Ethereum has managed a 39% increase over the month, demonstrating substantial market confidence. If Ethereum can surpass the $2920 resistance, it might achieve a new high of around $3240, translating to an 18% gain from its current position.

2025-06-07T22:24:54,"Decoding the Chaos: What the Trump-Musk Clash Really Means for Bitcoin and These 2 Altcoins","The public schism between Donald Trump and Elon Musk has done more than just tank Tesla's stock—it has sent shockwaves through the crypto world. Their feud over the 'Big Beautiful Bill' became an unexpected marketing campaign for Bitcoin and has stirred up significant excitement around two specific altcoins that thrived on the chaos. Curious about which digital currencies are poised for a breakout fueled by this political drama? This article unpacks the recent events and reveals key insights into the potential market movers. Bitcoin's Bullish Surge Continues with Sights Set on $121k Target Source: tradingview Bitcoin currently fluctuates between $102,410 and almost $110,000, showing strong bullish control despite some resistance. The nearest challenge for bulls lies just above $114,000. If momentum continues, Bitcoin could aim for just over $121,600, a potential growth of roughly 12% from current levels. Support remains at around $99,000, giving investors confidence in a strong base. The 10-day and 100-day averages stay close, around $105,000, indicating stability. Bitcoin's RSI suggests it's not overly bought, pointing to room for growth. The recent one-month rise of about 9% highlights potential for further gains, indicating bears are currently held at bay. Ethereum Poised for Explosive Growth, Targets $3240 Source: tradingview Ethereum's price hovers between $2410 and $2729.90, showing slight bullish strength with recent gains of nearly 39% over the past month. However, a minor dip of less than 1% this week suggests some hesitation. The bulls seem slightly weak as they need to push past the $2920 resistance to gain momentum. If Ethereum breaks this level, it could climb over 18% more to approach the $3240 mark. Support is firmly set at about $2280, offering a safety net. Current analysis shows potential for growth, but the market waits to see if bulls can overcome these hurdles and surge past existing resistances. When Opinion Leaders Crash Value, Graphite Offers Trust That Doesn’t Wobble In a landscape where markets still react more to personality than performance, Graphite Network is building a blockchain where reputation is earned by verifiable action . It’s a bold reimagining of digital trust: structural, measurable, and immune to manipulation. Graphite Network runs on the Polymer 2.0 Proof-of-Authority (PoA) blockchain, capable of processing 1,400 transactions per second with consistent, predictable fees. That places it firmly in competition with traditional finance systems in terms of throughput and reliability, while offering the decentralization and auditability TradFi lacks. Beyond just optimizing speed, Graphite Network is redesigning the trust layer. One Account, One Reputation: A Clean Slate for Blockchain Identity Graphite Network enforces a one-account-per-user model via a setup fee paid in $@G, its native token . This model creates a powerful deterrent to spam, simplifies counterparty due diligence, and builds a cleaner, more accountable user base. At the heart of this identity layer is the Trust Score system that evaluates users based on behavioral signals: Transaction history KYC status (optional, but rewarded) Interactions with other verified accounts For decentralized apps, this system enables risk-aware user filtering, empowering platforms and users to set their own thresholds for trust. Graphite Network Bets Big on Reputation-Led Blockchain in 2025 When volatility has again exposed the emotional core of financial markets, Graphite Network is advancing a different thesis: that trust, if structurally embedded, can outperform hype. The core of its 2025 roadmap is a push to operationalize reputation as infrastructure where Layer-2 solutions will blur the line between blockchain and behavioral credibility. Among its flagship rollouts: Phonebook Reputation MVP: A decentralized ID model linking Trust Scores to phone numbers via smart contracts. The goal is to allow users to evaluate counterparty risk in real-time using a phone number as a proxy for on-chain trustworthiness. Hotspot Bundle Initiative: A hardware-software package designed to onboard remote and underbanked populations into the Graphite ecosystem. Participants will be able to operate nodes and earn income, effectively lowering the barrier to Web3 participation. Geo Game Powered by DePIN: An educational gaming product simulating real-world macro conditions such as inflation and resource scarcity. Users will interact with on-chain economies in a controlled, gamified environment. Graphite Network brings the blockchain one step closer to real-world usability: a trusted, intuitive environment for everyone — from everyday users to enterprise builders. Learn More about Graphite Network Conclusion In decoding the market chaos from the Trump-Musk clash, a clear, multi-layered picture emerges. The feud reinforced Bitcoin's dominance as the market's safe haven and highlighted Ethereum's position as a major altcoin poised for its own breakout. Beyond these leaders, the event also shined a spotlight on projects like Graphite Network, which offers not a trade on the current system, but a fundamental investment in a new one immune to such political drama. The key takeaway is that the chaos creates distinct opportunities: to ride the momentum of established leaders or to invest in the foundations of a more stable future.

2025-06-07T22:00:10,"Can Bitcoin Price Bounce To $120,000 Or Will It Break Below $100,000?","The Bitcoin price has continued to trade sideways since hitting a new all-time high (ATH) of $111,900 earlier in May. Amid the current price action, crypto analyst Decode has provided insights into whether the leading crypto will rally to $120,000 or drop below $100,000 next. Analyst Reveals What’s Next For The Bitcoin Price In an X post, Decode shared an accompanying chart in which he made an ABC wave analysis of the current Bitcoin price action. Based on his analysis, the leading crypto is expected to drop below $100,000 before it rallies to a new ATH of $120,000. The chart showed that BTC could fall to as low as $96,500 on the Wave B corrective move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Bounces Off Re-Accumulation Zone: Why $120,000 Could Be Next This drop to $96,500 is expected to happen this month. Once that is done, Decode predicts that the Bitcoin price could rally above $120,500 before the end of July. This will mark the Wave C impulsive move to the upside. This aligns with veteran trader Peter Brandt’s prediction that BTC could reach as high as $150,000 by late summer. However, crypto analyst KillaXBT has predicted that the Bitcoin price could hit the $120,000 target by mid-June. This coincides with the June FOMC meeting, which is scheduled for June 17 and 18. A Fed rate cut could serve as the catalyst for such a parabolic rally from the current BTC price level. According to CME FedWatch data, there is a 97.4% chance that the Fed would keep interest rates unchanged. As such, market participants aren’t expecting a rate cut, which is why the Bitcoin price could pump massively if Jerome Powell and the FOMC were to surprise everyone. Moreover, US President Donald Trump yesterday urged the Fed to cut rates by a full point. A Breakout Might Be On The Cards In an X post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto suggested that a breakout could be imminent for the Bitcoin price. He noted that BTC is progressing inside a 4-hour falling wedge, which indicates a bullish reversal pattern. If confirmed, the analyst stated that the breakout could target the $107,500 and $109,500 zones, which are the Fibonacci confluence areas. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Puts Bitcoin Price At $120,000 If This Range Breakout Happens Crypto analyst Kevin Capital highlighted the solid V-shape recovery for the Bitcoin price after the leading crypto dropped to as low as $100,000 on May 5. However, the analyst noted that BTC’s rebound back to the $105,000 zone won’t matter until it breaks above the $106,800 level. The leading crypto must also show actual follow-through with 3-day to 1-week closes to support a breakout. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $105,000.

The New York court decision on President Trump’s tariff plan boosted investor sentiment mid-week. Last week’s fund flows highlighted a slight geographical shift, although the United States remained dominant due to institutional demand. A String Of Consecutive Weekly Inflows The digital asset market remains bullish following recent global institutional investment. A recent CoinShares Fund Flows shows a $286 million inflow, marking the seventh consecutive weekly gain. Bitcoin, the largest crypto by market cap, saw swift exits, recording $8 million outflows. Bitcoin started the week in the green zone on the heels of institutional accumulation but lost steam after a New York court decided on recent White House tariffs. Still, Bitcoin price trades within the $106k zone, though down from its $111k all-time high. Bulls are optimistic due to publicly-listed firms acquiring the assets. Michael Saylor’s Strategy purchased 705 BTC on Monday, taking holdings to 580,955 BTC. Although the buy was the smallest in several weeks, Strategy bolstered wider interest. Japanese Metaplanet also scooped up more assets in the same period. Meanwhile, Ether was the highest gainer last week as institutional funds attracted a massive $321 million. This brings the figure for the last six weeks to $1.19 billion as investors remain keen on an altcoin resurgence. Monthly figures are now up to $889 million while assets under management jumped above $14 billion. Spot Ethereum ETFs in the United States also notched gains within the week. Last month, the general spike in decentralized finance (DeFi) activities was a major ETH driver. This string of bullish inflows marks the highest Ether run since December 2024. XRP Loses Institutional Momentum Per the data, XRP shed $28 million in the last seven days, stretching monthly losses, while year-to-date figures remain in the green zone. XRP saw huge gains earlier this year on the back of an expected spot ETF approval, but lost momentum after delayed decisions by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Odds are still in favor for an approval this year. “ Regionally, investor focus shifted somewhat away from the US, which still recorded inflows of US$199m last week. Germany and Australia saw inflows of US$42.9m and US$21.5m, respectively. Meanwhile, Hong Kong experienced its strongest weekly post-seed inflows since the launch of exchange-traded products just over a year ago, totalling US$54.8 million.”",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/ether-outshines-btc-xrp-institutional-products-following-321-million-pump/,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING|XRP","Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Ethereum News|XRP News",cryptocompare

The lawyer fired back at an X user who made several claims about the token, including a statement that XRP’s legal status remains undefined. Bill Morgan retorted, explaining that the Judge had in fact established that XRP was not a security. Notably, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission did not counter the Judge’s assertion during the legal battle between the regulator and Ripple. “This is a lie. XRP has been found by a judge not itself to be a security. The SEC Appeal did not challenge that finding. To say XRP has no legal clarity is the biggest lie I have seen in crypto this year.” The attorney wrote . Analisa Torres, the judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, remarked that XRP was not an investment contract. However, Morgan said the judge’s opinion, also known as a “dicta,” does not qualify as a formal ruling. “Dicta does provide a degree of legal clarity. It is persuasive authority, and there is no finding to the contrary that XRP is a security. Also persuasive is the reasoning that led to the funding that XRP is not a security. It has more judicial clarity than Bitcoin which has none.” He added. The attorney countered other Bitcoin-related claims, further establishing Bitcoin’s position in the market. “Bitcoin has not been deemed to be a commodity. Courts don’t deem things, they make findings.” He wrote. While there might have been an instance of an obiter, an in-passing statement made by a Judge, describing Bitcoin as a commodity, the attorney maintains that there is yet to be a court case in which Bitcoin has been declared a commodity.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/attorney-addresses-claims-of-ripples-xrp-having-no-legal-clarity/,"BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|SPONSORED|XRP","Cryptocurrency|Featured|News|Ripple|XRP News",cryptocompare

The Ethereum competitor will likely rally towards its $165 target, a 13% rally within the next week. While Ethereum draws the interest of institutional investors, Solana is competing through partnerships and decentralized applications on the blockchain. Table of Contents Solana price forecast SOL could rally for these three reasons Solana derivatives analysis How Trump-Musk tussle influenced Solana price Solana: A one-trick pony or not Solana price forecast According to technical indicators on the SOL/USDT daily price chart, Solana ( SOL ) could soon observe a trend reversal. SOL is trading at $149.92, and the Ethereum ( ETH ) competitor could rally 13% and test resistance at $170, the upper boundary of the FVG on the daily price chart. Above $170, there are two key resistances: R1, which is the psychologically important price level of $200, and R2, which is the lower boundary of an FVG on the daily price chart, at $218.40. The RSI on the SOL/USDT price chart reads 39 and slopes upwards. MACD flashes red histogram bars under the neutral line. The OBV indicator shows a bullish divergence, with the price heading downwards while the OBV indicator slopes upward. The divergence is typically a sign of a potential trend reversal. In this case, the consolidation likely ends and SOL price changes in the coming week.

The project, Ecopedia, is set to provide structured and accessible crypto education. Solana’s meme coin ecosystem tanked in response to the tussle between U.S. President Donald Trump and Tesla Chief Elon Musk. In the past week, the past 24 hours, and on Friday, the sector’s market capitalization has declined. The market cap of the Solana meme coin ecosystem has fallen 5% in the past 24 hours to nearly $10 billion. It is likely that once the tussle settles, Solana could resume its uptrend.

The long/short ratio exceeds one on Binance and OKX meaning traders are taking more bullish bets on Solana, expecting the token’s price to rally. Solana derivatives data analysis | Source: Coinglass How Trump-Musk tussle influenced Solana price The public spat between the U.S. President and Tesla Chief made headlines for its impact on Nasdaq, Tesla stock price, and Bitcoin ( BTC ), among other things. Solana’s price slipped, alongside other altcoins, as traders turned risk-off. Sentiment shifted from neutral to fear in the past day. Solana has made strides with gains on Friday, it remains to be seen whether the token can wipeout the losses from the past seven days, in the coming week. The Trump-Musk tussle’s impact is felt in the Solana meme coin ecosystem, with a steep decline in market capitalization. A 5% drop within a 24-hour timeframe is significant, and a recovery is less likely unless led by a catalyst. Solana: A one-trick pony or not Analysts at Standard Chartered, the banking giant, labeled Solana a one-trick pony for the meme coin ecosystem’s role in pushing SOL’s price and value higher in the past year. However, it is likely that there is more to SOL with stablecoins, DeFi protocols and partnership announcements in 2025 alone. Standard Chartered meme coins have stress-tested the blockchain in the past, proving its scalability and throughput are effective and paving the way for higher adoption and partnerships. In their report, Standard Chartered suggests Solana expand to other sectors to boost its utility, however SOL generates higher volume and utility from meme coin transactions in the past year. While usage may have declined since the peak of the meme coin rally. Meme coin utility peak | Source: Standard Chartered Solana trades at $150 at the time of writing on Friday.

2025-06-07T21:27:37,"Satoshi Namakoto’s Net Worth to Topple Warren Buffett’s if Bitcoin Makes this Move","Following Bitcoin’s break above $111,000, market participants have been more bullish than ever, anticipating a continuous upward movement for the asset. Notably, one prominent analyst whose bullish sentiments remain untested is predicting that Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous founder of Bitcoin, could record a massive increase in his net worth. In the near term, Nakamoto’s net worth could topple that of longtime Billionaires Warren Buffett and Mark Zuckerberg , he asserted. Eric Balchunas, the senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg who took to X to share his outlook, is painting a bullish scenario for Bitcoin to validate this prediction. Balchunas outlined the possibilities in a post shared with his 357,000 followers, remarking that Satoshi Nakamoto could be catapulted to a new position in the world’s billionaire list if Bitcoin follows its historical yearly trend of attaining a 50% increase in price value. This year, Nakamoto could replace Warren Buffett and go on to knock out Mark Zuckerberg to become the second richest billionaire, he asserted. At report time, Bitcoin is trading at $105,422. A 50% increase in Bitcoin’s current price will result in a total value of $158,133. “If bitcoin does its normal 50%, then Satoshi will pass Buffett this year and Zuck sometime next year-ish to be #2 richest in the world (Elon has a huge lead). It’s fascinating to ponder that the founder of something so successful never cashed in. It echoes Jack Bogle in that regard.” The analyst wrote . His sentiments come as market participants revisited the famous Satoshi Nakamoto Bitcoin wallet addresses “1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa,” to find that the Bitcoin founder’s holdings had risen to $120 billion worth of Bitcoin.

As of June 3, Buffett’s net worth of $154 billion made him the sixth richest billionaire on the Forbes list , while Zuckerberg holds the second position with a net worth of $216 billion.

As a ratings platform, Weiss Ratings reported that interest levels make up 50% of the federal deficit. “Total U.S. federal debt is $34 trillion. That’s an increase of $11 trillion in just four years, the fastest pace in history. At roughly $1 trillion a year, interest alone now accounts for half the federal deficit.” The report read. Speaking on the dangers of the new development in the U.S. economy, Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, brought attention to the emerging U.S. debt market crisis. “It’s a big deal, it is a real problem,” he remarked. Bitcoin as an antidote to economic collapse In a follow-up response, Weiss’s Crypto rating outlined a bullish scenario that could unfold if the current market pattern continues. Should the Treasury market collapse with the introduction of new issuance, the Federal Reserve system could kick off a fiat currency printing spree; a move that could position Bitcoin and other crypto assets as better alternatives. “The moment the Treasury market cracks under a mountain of new issuance, the Fed will ride to the rescue to buy U.S. government debt. They will print with reckless abandon, debase the currency, launching crypto (and other assets) straight into the stratosphere.” The report read. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are increasingly considered alternative assets capable of combating inflation for traditional market players.

2025-06-07T21:15:56,"DappRadar: DeFi and NFT Upticks in May Could Mark Start of Recovery","As Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high in May, sparking momentum across cryptocurrencies, the decentralized app industry also saw a revival. In fact, DappRadar’s latest findings identify May 2025 as a turning point for the dapp sector. During the same period, the NFT market also saw signs of life. Turning Point for the Dapp Ecosystem In May, the dapp industry exhibited renewed optimism as the daily Unique Active Wallets (dUAW) rose 8% to 25 million, amid broader positive market trends. Notable growth was seen in three key sectors: AI dapps surged 23% to 4.8 million dUAW, social dapps grew 21% to 4.3 million, and NFT dapps increased 9% to 3.9 million. These sector-specific gains indicate stronger user engagement and contribute to a more balanced dapp ecosystem, according to DappRadar’s report . Meanwhile, AI, DeFi, and gaming dapps were found to have been converging in terms of user activity, and each captured a similar share, which evidenced a diversified and maturing market The DeFi sector also maintained strong growth as the Total Value Locked (TVL) surged by 25% to around $200 billion. This growth aligns with the overall market rally, driven by Bitcoin’s new all-time high and Ethereum’s 40% price increase, which boosted DeFi asset values and liquidity. Decentralized exchange Hyperliquid stood out by reaching $244 billion in trading volume, capturing about 10% of Binance’s market share despite massive criticism from prominent industry players after the controversial handling of a market manipulation incident. This achievement positioned Hyperliquid among the top 5 exchanges by trading volume, across both centralized and decentralized platforms, and within the top 10 by TVL across all blockchain networks. NFT Market Rebounds Meanwhile, the NFT market showed renewed activity in May, with trading volume rising 40% month-over-month to $280 million. Transaction counts also climbed 35%, totaling 2.7 million. Although these figures signal improving momentum, DappRadar said that it is premature to call it a full recovery. Continued growth over the coming months will be crucial, but the recent gains still offer a promising sign for the sector. Ethereum regained its lead in the NFT market in May, with a 30% jump in trading volume and a 53% market share. It was followed by Immutable zkEVM at 13% and Abstract at 10%. Abstract’s 1200% surge was largely driven by speculation tied to farming incentives and potential airdrops.

2025-06-07T20:59:39,"Crypto Analyst Projects Mega Bitcoin Drive as Whales Resume Accumulation","Bitcoin (BTC) traders are flagging green signals after retail shakeups that saw swift offloads. This led to slight losses in Bitcoin institutional products last week, although the recent court decision on tariffs played a huge role. Several crypto analysts have tipped another bull movement due to whale purchases and long-term holder repositioning. Bitcoin Whales Are Buying Heavy On-chain data shows massive institutional Bitcoin adoption, potentially opening up a new bull phase. Digital asset analyst Amr Taha pointed to increased spot volumes, whale accumulations, and other positive metrics behind higher Bitcoin trader optimism. According to the data, long-term holders (LTH) net realized metric soared above the $20 billion mark. This becomes crucial to access the market’s state in line with historical data. LTH rapid buys always precede a bullish phase, as seen in 2021 and 2024. Recent movements also spiked optimism to new highs, backed by new capital flows. Long-term holders received this traction because, unlike retail traders who often prioritize profit taking, they refrain from sales during price dips. “ The convergence of rising exchange dominance, long-term holder confidence, and supply tightening paints a bullish picture for Bitcoin. While short-term corrections are possible, the underlying demand and reduction in available BTC on exchanges suggest that the uptrend is far from over. Furthermore, outflows from centralized crypto exchanges led to price gains before another correction. In the last 48 hours, Kraken and Bitfinex saw over 20,000 BTC offloads. Transfers out of exchanges soar trader confidence due to a higher chance of long-term holdings and decentralized finance (DeFi) activities in the case of meme coins. Crypto trader Ali Martinez flagged massive whale accumulations this week. Over the last four days, whales picked up 30,000 BTC, highly influenced by surging institutional participation . Mainstream Adoption Behind Soaring Bitcoin Optimism CryptoQuant data shows wallets with above 1000 BTC adding tokens at a steady pace. An interesting aspect is the “young/new whale addresses” have gained more exposure to Bitcoin in the last two months. This is directly linked to growing institutional interest in crypto assets. While the United States leads the pack, other jurisdictions have also beefed up holdings. Michael Saylor’s Strategy continues to accumulate above 581,000 tokens worth approximately $60.4 billion. As companies increase exposure, governments are leaning toward the market, seeking to drive investment.

Weekend losses have yet to be cleared off, as altcoins show a downward trend. One market participant has revisited his outlook for the long-awaited altcoin season, when altcoins rake in massive gains and outperform the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Benjamin Cowen, a prominent cryptocurrency analyst and the CEO of crypto analytical tool CryptoVerse, has recently resisted bullish altcoin sentiments. “I think we will see ALT /BTC pairs get rejected at their bull market support band,” the analyst wrote in a post shared with X. He highlighted the pair’s historical performance from 2018, exposing a downward reversal trend recorded at critical resistance levels. With altcoins collectively nursing losses, the analyst revisited his prediction, observing that the ALT/BTC pairs were rejected from the bull market support band, further sending the asset to lower lows on May 31st.

2025-06-07T20:30:44,"Watch Out For These Levels If Bitcoin Price Returns To $100K: Blockchain Firm","The Bitcoin price has not had quite the same spark it did at the beginning of the last month so far in June. The premier cryptocurrency has somewhat struggled to break out of a consolidation range since reaching a new all-time high in the month of May. The Bitcoin price recently succumbed to bearish pressure, falling to around $101,000 on Friday, June 6. While the market leader has enjoyed some resurgence to begin the weekend, a prominent blockchain firm has now identified significant levels in the event of a return to the $100,000 level in the coming days. Here Are The Next Support Levels For BTC In a June 6 post on the social media platform X, crypto analytics firm Sentora (previously known as IntoTheBlock) revealed an interesting on-chain perspective on the price of Bitcoin and its latest dip toward $100,000. According to the intelligence platform, there are some significant levels lying just beneath the six-figure valuation threshold. This analysis is based on the average cost basis of several Bitcoin investors and the distribution of the BTC supply around the current price. For context, cost-basis analysis basically evaluates the capacity of a price level to act as support or resistance, depending on the volume of crypto last acquired by investors at this level. As observed in the chart below, the size of the dots directly corresponds with the quantity of BTC purchased within each price bracket and the region’s capacity to act as support or resistance. This implies that the larger the dot, the higher the number of coins purchased, and the stronger the support or resistance level; the green dots are support (as they are usually below the current price), while the red dots serve as resistance (as they are above the asset price). According to data by Sentora, the Bitcoin price seems to have major support within the $95,000 – $99.000 region due to heavy accumulation by investors. This price zone would serve as an on-chain cushion for the Bitcoin price, as investors with their cost bases around the level are likely to defend their positions by acquiring more coins if the price falls toward the $95,000 – $99,000 zone. Sentora mentioned that if the bulls do defend this support level, the Bitcoin price could be in for an extended rally. On the flip side, the on-chain firm asked investors to expect a surge in volatility if this support level fails to hold. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC sits just above $104,400, reflecting an almost 3% increase in the past 24 hours.

The show will feature eight online streamers competing for a special prize: one Bitcoin (BTC). This news has caught the attention of the crypto community. This comes as the flagship crypto is gaining interest beyond finance, reaching the entertainment industry. Bitcoin Prize Reward Raises Eyebrows Unlike most shows that offer cash prizes or sponsored holiday trips, the House of Streams show, backed by the Malta Film Commission, will reward the winner with cryptocurrency. The decision to offer Bitcoin prizes has raised eyebrows with the crypto community. Meanwhile, Netflix has explored crypto themes in past content. This includes Trust No One: The Hunt for the Crypto King and the upcoming The Altruists. However, this is the platform’s first time directly tying a cryptocurrency to a prize. The eight House of Streams contestants will participate in many challenges. Notably, the details of the show have yet to be revealed. The contestants reportedly have a combined following of four million across popular streaming platforms, such as Twitch. Some familiar names already revealed include The Black Hokage, CyborgAngel, and OutplayedByJade. The Fake Token Menace Following the announcement, scammers tried to exploit the show’s buzz. They launched fake tokens using the House of Streams name. In response, the producers issued a warning on May 22, urging viewers to stay cautious and report any suspicious promotions. This malicious act is very common in the crypto industry as scammers do take advantage to impersonate popular events or growing trends. Crypto-Related Crimes Are On The Rise House of Streams is launching during a tense time in the crypto industry. As digital assets become more valuable, high-profile figures are being targeted . In May 2024, a crypto entrepreneur’s father was rescued from a hostage situation in France. The kidnappers had cut off one of his fingers to force access to his son’s wallet. Not long after, French crypto exchange CEO Pierre Noizat faced a similar scare . His daughter and grandson were nearly abducted in a broad daylight attack. Thankfully, authorities fought off the masked assailants with the help of a bystander. In the U.S., a man returning from a crypto event in Las Vegas was kidnapped at gunpoint. Teenagers from Florida forced him into a car, covered his head, and drove him over 70 miles into the Arizona desert. These frightening incidents have sparked urgent calls for better protection for crypto holders and influencers. As the value of digital assets climbs, so too does the risk.

APE is correcting from highs registered in the last quarter of 2024. The drop could be attributed to the wider market sentiment. Can ApeCoin reach $10? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, APE will break above $10 in 2030. At the time, APE should have bridged to ApeChain and grown much utility and applications such as in the metaverse. Will APE reach $100? It is unlikely that the APE price will be extended to $100 in the foreseeable future. At such a valuation, APE will be more valuable than the USDT stablecoin, which is more of a ‘household’ cryptocurrency. Can ape coin hit $1000? It is unlikely that the APE price will reach $1000 before 2031. Does ApeCoin have a future? With the launch of ApeChain, ApeCoin now has more utility and is, therefore, much more likely to last into the future. How much is ApeCoin worth in 2025? For 2025, the APE coin price will range between $0.58 and $1.59. The average price for the year will be $1.01. Is APE a good investment? APE’s utility is growing, and the launch of ApeChain is anticipated to attract more projects that use the APE token either for governance or settling fees on the chain. Yuga Labs and other new firms will likely promote APE. Recent news With the launch of ApeChain, APE proceeded to pump by over 100% accompanied by the launch of new projects such as Donkey Dash, Ape Express, Battle Plan, and the Ape Portal APE price prediction June 2025 The APE June price prediction ranges between $0.48 and $1.15, with an average of $0.69.

The market started reversing afterward, and by June, it had fallen below $1. It crossed into August trading at $0.71. In September, it rose to $0.87 but later corrected falling to the $0.67 mark in October.

2025-06-07T19:07:17,"Bitcoin Holds Above $105K Despite Donald Trump’s Threats Against Elon Musk","Bitcoin BTC held firm above $105,000 on Saturday despite an unusually combative and personal escalation in the Trump-Musk feud that could rattle traditional markets next week. On Saturday, in a phone interview with NBC News , President Trump warned that there would be “serious consequences” if Elon Musk financially backed Democratic candidates running against Republicans who support the GOP’s budget bill. “If he does, he’ll have to pay the consequences for that,” Trump said, adding later, “He’ll have to pay very serious consequences if he does that.” Trump, who has often boasted of past support from Musk, firmly dismissed the idea of mending ties. “No,” he said when asked whether he wished to repair the relationship. “I would assume so, yeah,” he added when asked if the rift was permanent. Despite the intensifying feud between two of the most influential figures in U.S. politics and technology, Bitcoin remained unfazed. The cryptocurrency held onto earlier gains and continues to trade near weekly highs. The market's composure suggests that traders may increasingly view BTC as a hedge against institutional dysfunction, or at least as an asset insulated from the partisan fallout that tends to impact equities more directly. Technical Analysis Highlights BTC traded in a 24-hour range of $1,162 (1.13%), from a low of $104,624 to a high of $105,786, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. Strong support formed at $104,800, where above-average volume confirmed buyer interest. Resistance at $105,200 was broken and has since flipped into a short-term support zone. Volume peaked at 378 BTC during key breakout moments, especially around 13:43–13:46 and 13:53. A short consolidation occurred between $104,300–$104,600 before the final surge to near highs. An ascending price channel remains intact, showing bullish structure despite intermittent pullbacks.

2025-06-07T19:00:50,"XRP Price Risks Plummeting Below $2 As Sellers Take Control","XRP is currently showing signs of vulnerability as its recent price action is becoming increasingly bearish. After attempting to reclaim upside momentum above $ 2.60 in May, the cryptocurrency has struggled to maintain this run, and its price action over the past few days has brought it close to losing the $2.10 price level. Notably, the price action has resulted in the formation of a head and shoulders pattern on the daily candlestick chart. This might be the final straw that finally sends the XRP price plummeting below $2. Related Reading: Bitcoin Scarcity May Spark Explosive Surge, Bank Study Shows XRP Breaks Head And Shoulders Neckline As identified by a crypto analyst on the social media platform X, XRP has now printed a classic head and shoulders formation, with clearly defined symmetry between the left shoulder, head, and right shoulder. The head and shoulders formation began taking shape in late April, when the price climbed to $2.26 to become the left shoulder of the pattern. In early to mid-May, XRP surged above $2.60 to create the head of the formation and what appeared at the time to be a resumption of strong bullish momentum. The rally lost steam soon after reaching that May peak, and the price began to retreat once again. By June 3, XRP made another attempt to push higher, reaching $2.27 in what is the formation of the right shoulder. However, this push wasn’t enough, and the ensuing price action has seen sellers gradually fighting for control. The head and shoulders pattern, which is often associated with trend reversals, became more concerning once XRP broke below the neckline around the $2.18 level to reach as low as $2.07 on July 6. Interestingly, the breakdown below the neckline was accompanied by increased volume, which provided additional confirmation of the bearish signal. EMA Rejections For XRP: What’s Next? Now that XRP has broken beneath the neckline, the $2.18 to $2.20 zone is beginning to flip into a firm resistance barrier for any attempt at recovery. The daily candlestick chart shows XRP continuing to trade below both the 9-day EMA and the 50-day SMA, which currently stand at $2.1877 and $2.2649 respectively. Despite a modest recovery over the past 24 hours, XRP has repeatedly failed to break back above the 9-day EMA since the neckline breakdown, showing persistent weakness in the short-term structure. As long as XRP is trapped beneath the neckline and the EMA/SMA resistance cluster, the prevailing structure continues to favor a downward extension. Based on the head and shoulders setup, a measured move from the neckline breakdown projects a decline toward the $1.85 to $1.80 range. Related Reading: Bitcoin Network Activity Booming Despite A Quiet Market—Data At the time of writing, XRP now finds itself trading at the neckline resistance again at $2.18 after a 2.6% increase in the past 24 hours from $2.13. However, the strength of this bounce is questionable, as it has occurred alongside a sharp 48.14% drop in trading volume. The next 24 hours will be important, as price behavior around the $2.18 to $2.20 range could determine whether XRP resumes its descent and break below $2.

2025-06-07T18:35:58,"Cardano, Litecoin and Remittix Look Ready To Soar In June If Bitcoin Plays Ball","In crypto, Bitcoin doesn’t just lead, it orchestrates. With a $2 trillion market cap and dominance over 40% of the entire crypto market, its every move sends ripples across the altcoin sea. Most altcoins move in lockstep with it, boasting a correlation as high as 0.9. So when Bitcoin flinches, the rest of the market often follows. That’s why all eyes are on BTC this June. A confirmed breakout could ignite what traders call “altcoin season”, and some coins are perfectly positioned to ride the wave. Cardano is flashing bullish technicals, Litecoin is showing signs of a quiet comeback and Remittix , a newcomer with real-world payments utility, is gaining serious traction. Here, we’ll see why, if Bitcoin plays ball, these three may not just follow, they could lead the next leg up. Cardano could fly high if Bitcoin gives it wings Cardano (ADA) is flashing signs of bullish momentum, trading between $0.75 and $0.81 after a 14% weekly climb. Analysts project a June range of $0.791–$0.905, with bullish scenarios targeting $1.08–$1.47, if it can break above $0.85. However, a slip below $0.73 could pull ADA toward $0.50, especially if Bitcoin stumbles. Source: Bitpanda On-chain data and whale accumulation (over 420M ADA bought recently) support short-term price stability. Technologically, Cardano is advancing with its Ouroboros upgrade and Hydra Layer-2 scaling solution, while its Argentina partnership for lithium tokenization shows growing real-world use. Still, ADA’s fate is tightly linked to Bitcoin, with a 0.8–0.9 correlation. If BTC surges past $118,000, ADA could rally 25%–80%. But without BTC momentum or ecosystem catalysts like the Hydra launch, a major breakout remains uncertain. Cardano may soar, but only if Bitcoin lifts the tide. Litecoin may be down but not out Litecoin price action in mid-2025 tells a story of quiet resilience. After falling from $130 to as low as $71, LTC is regaining ground, trading between $71.57 and $100. Analysts forecast a June target of $117–$140, with bullish voices like Paulo Ricci eyeing $150 by July, assuming Bitcoin keeps climbing. Source: CoinCentral Behind the scenes, Litecoin is quietly evolving. The MWEB upgrade boosts its privacy and scalability, while rising hash rates and on-chain accumulation point to growing confidence. Institutional tailwinds, from Fidelity’s retirement accounts to Telegram’s payments integration, add fuel to the fire. If Bitcoin hits $118K, LTC could easily ride the wave to $120 or higher. Still, competition is fierce, and the Litecoin price needs more than nostalgia to soar. Without unique innovation or a fresh narrative, LTC’s breakout depends heavily on Bitcoin’s next move. Remittix is building what crypto always promised Imagine a digital design studio in Lagos working with clients from Berlin, Dubai and New York. Instead of fighting with unavailable Stripe support or eating wire fees, they integrate RemittixPay . Clients pay in fiat or crypto and Remittix handles the rest, converting to local currency and delivering it to their bank. Clean, compliant, no currency chaos. Is Remittix the Next XRP?! New 10X Potential Crypto?! This isn't just another payment tool, it’s infrastructure. Like Shopify for global commerce, Remittix gives creators and small businesses control. Its flat-fee crypto-to-fiat engine supports 100+ tokens and 30+ currencies, turning blockchain into a bridge, not a barrier. It’s as intuitive as online banking. No seed phrases, no Web3 jargon, just send, receive, withdraw. With Ethereum-linked momentum and BTC correlation near 0.8, a Bitcoin breakout to $118K could launch RTX toward $1.50. If crypto’s next wave is about real-world utility, Remittix might be riding its crest. Conclusion Bitcoin steers the crypto market and if it breaks out in June, Cardano, Litecoin and Remittix are poised to soar. Cardano’s tech upgrades and partnerships, Litecoin’s steady comeback and Remittix’s real-world payment utility could lead the next rally, if Bitcoin plays ball, these altcoins won’t just follow, they’ll lead.

2025-06-07T18:32:27,"Exploring Ethereum's Potential Surge and Its Impact on ERC20 Tokens","The cryptocurrency sphere is witnessing a pivotal shift with Ethereum positioned to potentially lead the next big market move. While Bitcoin has enjoyed its fair share of the spotlight, reaching new all-time highs, its momentum seems to be tapering off, possibly making room for Ethereum to take center stage. Ethereum's Bullish Prospects With Ethereum displaying strong bullish patterns, the ripple effect on associated ERC20 tokens could be substantial. In particular, tokens like ENA and Remittix may see enhanced activity and valuations owing to their foundational relationship with Ethereum's technology. Deceleration in Bitcoin's Market Activity Recent analyses suggest a slowing in Bitcoin's ascent. Despite hitting a record high of $112K, various technical indicators such as MACD and Rate of Change, signal a potential downturn which might cause investors to pivot towards other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. View the recent Bitcoin price movement on CoinMarketCap . Implications for ERC20 Tokens: ENA and Remittix ENA is currently showing potential as a buying opportunity despite recent price dips. This sentiment is primarily due to the overall strengthening of the Ethereum ecosystem which might support recovery in related tokens. Graphical insights into ENA's recent performance can be viewed on CoinMarketCap . Furthermore, Remittix stands out with its PayFi platform that bridges the gap between crypto and fiat currencies, simplifying transactions and reducing fees, which could attract considerable attention with Ethereum's rising tide. Remittix's Market Position and Future Outlook Remittix has already seen substantial presale activity, signaling strong market trust and interest. With Ethereum's expected surge, Remittix’s innovative solutions could push it to the forefront of ERC20 tokens, making it a preferable choice for investors looking to leverage Ethereum's growth.

2025-06-07T18:32:19,"Bitcoin Price Set To Cool Off But Ethereum Looks Ready To Explode, These ETH Tokens Are Seeing Huge Volume","The cryptocurrency market appears to be at a significant juncture, with a noticeable shift in momentum between its two largest assets. Bitcoin price recently set another ATH (again), but there are indications it is slowing down. Conversely, Ethereum is increasingly exhibiting bullish indicators, positioning itself for a substantial price surge. If Ethereum plays out and explodes, it will have a cascading effect on ERC20 tokens, specifically ENA and Remittix . Who will have a compounded effect of their positive outlook and the base layer Ethereum jump. Cooling Bitcoin Worries Market Several technical indicators are suggesting a deceleration in Bitcoin’s move. Although it made headlines again as it punched a new ATH, its MACD and ROC are pointing towards a downturn. Even the monthly RSI, though higher than expected, is still in neutral territory. The US BTCETFs also mirror the sentiment, with $268 million in outflow. Bitcoin price cooling off after hitting $112K ATH. Graph source: CoinMarketCap Some suggest BTC is just doing a normal retraction, while other analysts see BTC in a Tariff Trap . Coupling this with risks of higher inflation on the horizon, if the Bitcoin price doesn’t shake out of the cooling period soon, it can test the $100,000 floor and in a worse situation, go well below it. Ethereum's Ascending Technicals and Ecosystem Boost While the bull run had many traders disappointed with Ethereum’s performance, this finally seems to be changing. 20, 50 and 100 EMAs are all pointing towards a buying opportunity, supported by its 12 and 26 MACD. ETH price movement for 30 days. Source: CoinMarketCap This technical narrative is further supported by ETF firms, where BlackRock and Fidelity dumped $180 million worth of BTC as it bled, and bought $78 million of ETH instead. EthereumCo-founder Buterin’s privacy advocacy on the Ethereum chain can also be a market mover, further strengthening Ethereum’s jump. What’s the verdict? Experts say Ethereum price can hit $4,000. Ethena On Recovery Ehtena (ENA) has experienced a pretty deep dive. Traders see the recent token unlock as the main reason, with supply flooding the market. Even with technical indicators like 10EMA and ROC showing a strong selling moment, savvy money is seeing this as a buying opportunity. ENA drop may be a buying opportunity. Source: CoinMarketCap With renewed interest in ETH, ERC20 tokens like ENA can ride the wave and recover losses. Pair that with rumors that Coinbase may list it, there is a flurry of buying activity. Remittix May Win The Race While all major ERC20 tokens can take advantage of the ETH predicted price boost, none will enjoy it more than Remittix . The PayFi protocol brings a whole new financial inclusion concept. It breaks the siloed nature of crypto and fiat, merging them into one. With seamless remittance of crypto into fiat, anyone with crypto can send traditional money to loved ones or even do grocery shopping where crypto is not accepted. The secret sauce?

Even businesses can enjoy the service with its Pay API, enabling establishments to accept over 100 crypto, directly deposited as fiat in their accounts. Ready to disrupt the global remittance industry, Remittix can be the ERC20 of choice with the expected Ethereum run as it capitalizes on breaking not only crypto-fiat barriers, but increasing the already fiery interest in its presale .

2025-06-07T18:30:00,"These Cheap Altcoins Could Go Bananas if Bitcoin (BTC) Breaks Its All-Time High Again","With Bitcoin (BTC) teasing a new all-time high, the spotlight is quickly shifting to undervalued assets that could ride the wave. Among the best cheap cryptos to buy now, Cardano (ADA) stands out, while still boasting one of the most robust ecosystems in the space. On the other hand, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new cryptocurrency still in its presale phase, is drawing attention with its DeFi-focused model and whispers of massive upside. The project is selling at $0.03 and is gaining interest rapidly. Already, more than $10.1 million has been raised in the presale of Mutuum Finance, with 11,700 people participating so far, who will witness the tokens appreciate to $0.035 as phase six begins. If Bitcoin smashes through resistance and triggers another market-wide surge, these altcoins could be among the next cryptos to explode, offering huge potential for early investors looking for the best crypto to invest in today. Cardano Set to Surge if Bitcoin Breaks All-Time High A new all-time high for Bitcoin (BTC) could give Cardano (ADA) a strong push higher. Today, ADA is going for about $0.69 and it is a great choice for buying cheap crypto because of its strong background and continuous growth. Over time, ADA’s performance has been strongly linked to the large rallies in the Bitcoin market, during those rallies, ADA went from below $0.10 to $3. Because BTC price discovery is underway, ADA may reclaim the $1 mark and could surge to $1.20–1.50 if positive momentum appears in the altcoin market. Many investors trying to catch the next major cryptocurrency rise are likely to keep ADA on their watchlist. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is newly emerged and often bought for its high expected returns in the current bull trend. Mutuum Finance Presale Gains Steam as a Rising DeFi Player Mutuum Finance is attracting even greater investor interest with its growing decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform. Leveraging cutting-edge DeFi technology and crypto lending features, the platform has already raised over $10 million and built a community of 11,700 holders. Currently, MUTM tokens trade at $0.03, with the following presale round having the price rise to $0.035.

2025-06-07T18:18:43,"Best Crypto to Buy Now With Global Mass Adoption Of Cryptocurrency Rising","Adoption was once a word loosely tossed around in crypto circles, used to spark hope more than signal reality. But that’s no longer the case. Now, both macro indicators and on-the-ground developments suggest that global acceptance is not just underway, it’s accelerating. Institutions are investing, while leading governments are adapting. Infrastructure is evolving. The most recent confirmation comes from a joint report by OKX and Blockworks Research, a result of extensive analysis and insights from industry heavyweights, including Polygon, Standard Chartered, and Google. It shows a significant uptick in crypto integration across finance, supply chains, and consumer industries. Global Indicators Show Crypto Is Embedding Itself Into the System The OKX–Blockworks report gets right into the facts by presenting hard data. Sixty percent of asset managers are reportedly planning to launch crypto investment products by 2026. Meanwhile, two-thirds of financial leaders are developing infrastructure for tokenized products. Institutional adoption, once a cautious experiment, is quickly becoming a strategic priority. Beyond banking, sectors like sports, fashion, and luxury goods are now applying blockchain for logistics, anti-counterfeiting, and audience engagement. *Metaplanet Announces Accelerated 2025-2027 Bitcoin Plan**Targeting 210,000 $BTC by 2027* pic.twitter.com/xJKu3J8Apb — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) June 6, 2025 This trend is mirrored in state-level moves as well. Japan-based Metaplanet, already holding over 8,800 BTC, has revised its Bitcoin reserve target to a staggering 100,000 BTC by 2026. The rationale, as per a spokesperson, is that traditional safe havens are failing, and Bitcoin, with its limited supply and decentralized design, offers a more reliable anchor in a shifting global economy. Another country to join the bandwagon is Pakistan. Its newly appointed crypto minister is actively in talks with U.S. and Wall Street leaders, aiming to position the country at the forefront of blockchain innovation. These visits’ agenda included serious discussions with Cantor Fitzgerald and Tether-backed ventures, with commitments toward Bitcoin bonds and a strategic national reserve. Regulatory progress across major economies is aligning as well. From the UK’s maturing framework to the EU’s MiCA rollout and increasing policy integration in the U.S., the legal backbone for a crypto-driven financial world is slowly solidifying. For long-term investors, these aren’t just news events. They’re signs of a foundational shift worth positioning for. Best Crypto to Buy Now - Presale Gems to Leverage Positive Market Sentiments While the market may be taking a hit right now with prices dropping, the macro trend suggests we are still in the bull run, which makes now an excellent time to stock up on projects with huge potential that are still priced at a nominal rate. Presales are excellent options for investors seeking such value, and we list some of the best options to consider in the space right now, considering their concepts, use case, and more. Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper introduces itself as an advanced Layer 2 solution looking to solve Bitcoin’s transactional limitations. It introduces a new protocol that allows users to move BTC onto a faster chain where transactions can be validated and settled with lower fees and greater efficiency. The framework integrates multiple scaling methods, including Optimistic Rollups, ZK-Rollups, and Rootstock sidechains, while maintaining Bitcoin as the underlying asset. What makes Bitcoin Hyper distinct is that it does not replace or compete with Bitcoin. Instead, it enhances its utility by making it viable for high-frequency trading, micropayments, and faster peer-to-peer transfers. By using the Solana Virtual Machine for its smart contract infrastructure, Bitcoin Hyper manages to bring scalability into a traditionally slow ecosystem without compromising security. Featured in videos of channels like Today Trader and more, its popularity has only skyrocketed in the past few days. The project is still in its presale phase, which means the infrastructure is in early development, but the roadmap points toward an interoperable environment that prioritizes usability and throughput. Bitcoin Hyper’s long-term growth potential hinges on whether it can become the go-to transaction layer for Bitcoin holders who want speed without sacrificing decentralization. As traditional systems begin to integrate tokenized services and faster settlements, a Bitcoin-native Layer 2 could find a solid use case. For users, this presents an opportunity to engage with Bitcoin in a more functional context while retaining the credibility of the base chain. SUBBD SUBBD is developing an infrastructure that centers around the creator economy, but with an approach that redefines ownership, monetization, and digital identity. It offers a token-based platform where creators can issue unique access rights, gated content, and on-chain audience engagement tools. This setup replaces traditional social media monetization models, which rely heavily on advertising and centralized revenue distribution. The $SUBBD token powers every transaction within the network, enabling creators to build their micro-economies without needing intermediaries. Subscription payments, limited-access merchandise, and voting systems for community decisions can all be implemented using smart contracts. The long-term objective is to create a circular economy that rewards both creators and their most active followers directly. This model is especially relevant in a digital environment where decentralized identity and blockchain-integrated content systems are gaining institutional attention. The OKX and Blockworks report highlighted how tokenized product infrastructure is becoming a focus for financial leaders. Platforms like SUBBD tap into this same technological direction but apply it to consumer engagement and digital media. In a climate where users are becoming more conscious of data ownership and fair compensation, SUBBD provides a framework that is both timely and needed. If successful, it could transform how people support creators, how content is licensed, and how engagement is rewarded, all while bypassing traditional gatekeepers. Its early presale pricing allows entry before utility expansion, making it a project of interest for those tracking real-world blockchain applications. Best Wallet Token Best Wallet Token anchors a multi-feature crypto wallet ecosystem that integrates advanced tools for portfolio tracking, secure storage, in-app swaps, and early access to presale tokens. It supports over 60 blockchain networks and uses a decentralized, non-custodial architecture to ensure user control over funds. In addition to wallet features, it includes a built-in DEX aggregator, market insights panel, and presale dashboard to help users discover and invest in upcoming projects. The wallet’s native token is designed to grant users exclusive access to higher staking yields, token launch allocations, and reward systems within the app. Its token utility is deeply connected to the broader usage of the app rather than external speculation. For instance, the more a user interacts with tools like the presale aggregator or the Best DEX, the more benefits they unlock through token holding. This model mirrors what many institutional frameworks are now shifting toward—fully integrated platforms that tie user activity directly to tokenized incentives. As firms explore tokenization across finance and user services, a wallet that links discovery, investment, and reward within one ecosystem becomes increasingly relevant. Best Wallet’s presale offers exposure to an infrastructure project already functioning at a public level but aiming to scale further. With crypto adoption rising and demand for self-custody solutions growing in response to both regulatory and institutional movement, utility-focused wallets may play a central role in onboarding new users securely and efficiently. Solaxy Solaxy’s Layer 2 blockchain enables efficient cross-chain activity between Ethereum and Solana. One may think of this as a Bitcoin Hyper-like project, but for a different blockchain. Also, rather than existing as a general-purpose L2, it has a defined objective, which is streamlining transactions for users who require the liquidity of Ethereum and the speed of Solana without being locked into one network. This approach allows users to bridge assets, execute smart contracts, and stake tokens across both chains in a single environment. The project’s token, SOLX, plays a central role in securing the network and rewarding validators. Users can stake SOLX to earn a share of protocol fees or participate in governance decisions that influence bridge parameters, transaction incentives, and protocol upgrades. For developers, Solaxy offers compatibility with Ethereum’s EVM and Solana’s Sealevel, allowing applications to run simultaneously across both ecosystems. $SOLX has got what YOU need. 🛸🪐45M Raised! 🔥 pic.twitter.com/hamUNI7Hgz — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) June 6, 2025 This model aligns with ongoing conversations about blockchain interoperability. As adoption grows, the demand for networks that can manage liquidity and activity across different chains without increasing transaction costs is only going to rise. Solaxy aims to solve this by reducing friction in asset movement while preserving decentralization. It has already raised upwards of $45 million in what is one of the most successful presales this quarter and is set to launch soon. The regulatory trend, particularly in the EU and UK, is beginning to accommodate networks that serve as backbones for decentralized applications. With enterprise-grade compliance structures becoming more common, Solaxy’s cross-chain design could find relevance in a regulated market that favors scalable, interoperable, and low-cost infrastructure. For users and developers looking for technical reliability tied to practical use, the platform presents a strong case for growth through function, not speculation. Snorter Snorter is a trading bot project that integrates artificial intelligence with on-chain market signals to provide real-time automated decision-making for crypto traders. The system is designed for both experienced and casual users, offering different levels of control, from fully autonomous trading to customizable strategy overlays. Built on a decentralized framework, the bot operates without third-party custody, ensuring that trades are executed from the user’s wallet while maintaining full transparency. The technology relies on large-scale data parsing from various blockchains, price aggregators, and liquidity pools. This input is filtered through machine learning algorithms that continuously optimize for volatility detection, arbitrage potential, and trend shifts. Users can also access backtesting tools and detailed performance analytics within the dashboard to assess effectiveness over time. Snorter’s token is used for tiered access, governance proposals, and fee reduction. Holding more tokens allows access to premium indicators, faster execution lanes, and higher API request limits. It also enables community participation in refining AI models through a structured feedback mechanism, making the system adaptive over time. As the world moves to AI integration in finance, tools like Snorter could become essential for managing the increasing complexity of decentralized markets. As institutional players and regulators begin to recognize algorithmic trading in the blockchain space, AI-based bots that maintain decentralization and data sovereignty will have strategic importance. Snorter is positioned as a utility-first protocol in a segment where usability, performance, and control directly influence adoption. For traders seeking automation without compromise, it offers a focused solution. Conclusion Mass adoption of cryptocurrency is materializing through measurable actions from governments, financial institutions, and infrastructure providers worldwide. From strategic Bitcoin reserves to institutional-grade compliance platforms and tokenized financial products, the direction is clear. For investors, this phase represents a critical window—one where early engagement in credible, utility-driven initiatives may offer the most substantial long-term advantage. The projects mentioned above could be one of the starting steps to creating a profitable portfolio, as long as one is careful about the risks involved in investing and only invests as much as they can afford to lose.

On June 6, ETFs tied to Ether attracted another $25.3 million in inflows, according to data from Farside. This marked the third straight week of uninterrupted gains. Momentum Builds Since Mid-May The inflow streak began on May 16 and has now totaled $837.5 million. That figure accounts for about 25% of the $3.32 billion in net inflows since Ether ETFs launched in July 2024. If current momentum continues, another $162.5 million in inflows would push the streak past the $1 billion mark. By contrast, Bitcoin ETFs saw their own streak broken on May 29, when they recorded outflows totaling $346.8 million. Bitcoin ETF flows have since been mixed, showing both inflow and outflow days. Ether, meanwhile, has enjoyed strong price performance. Its price rose more than 31% over the last 30 days, currently trading around $2,490, according to CoinMarketCap. Technical Signals Point to $6K Potential Analysts remain optimistic about Ether’s long-term trajectory. Crypto Eagles, a well-followed technical analyst, suggested on June 3 that Ether’s current cycle mirrors past price patterns, possibly setting the stage for a rally toward $6,000. Ether last hit its all-time high of $4,878 in November 2021, per CoinGecko. Some market watchers believe that incorporating staking into spot Ether ETFs could be the next major development. This enhancement could significantly boost their competitiveness and investor appeal. Staking ETFs May Be on the Horizon Recent developments suggest staking options could soon arrive in the U.S. market. ETF provider REX Shares has filed to launch both Ethereum and Solana staking ETFs. James Seyffart, an ETF analyst, noted that REX used regulatory workarounds in an effort to bring these products to market. While no official launch date has been set, expectations are building. As Ether’s price strengthens and institutional interest grows, ETFs appear poised to become a dominant force in the asset’s adoption.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/ether-etfs-extend-inflow-streak-toward-1b-as-price-climbs-over-30/,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence",cryptocompare

After a sharp retrace alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum, Solana is stabilizing above key demand levels, sparking cautious optimism among investors. Many are eyeing this zone as a potential launchpad for the next leg up, especially as the market seeks to recover and regain bullish momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Largest Net Taker Volume Drop Of 2025 – Traders React To Trump-Elon Clash Despite recent uncertainty, sentiment around Solana remains constructive. Analysts point to strong structural support and a history of sharp rebounds from similar technical setups. Among them, top crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently shared a key signal that has caught the attention of traders: the TD Sequential indicator has flashed a buy signal for Solana on the daily timeframe. Historically, this signal has preceded notable price rallies, particularly when it aligns with strong support zones. With Solana holding firm and broader sentiment gradually improving, bulls are watching closely for a push into higher supply zones. If confirmed, a breakout from this range could send SOL toward new short-term highs. The coming days will be critical in determining whether Solana can sustain this momentum and lead the next altcoin rally. Solana Tests Support As TD Sequential Signals Rebound Solana is holding a critical support zone near $145 after shedding more than 20% of its value since late May. The correction has brought SOL into a key demand area, where bulls appear to be defending the level with strength. Despite attempts to reclaim $160, the altcoin has faced persistent resistance, with fading momentum and rising macro risks clouding short-term price action. Market-wide conditions haven’t helped either. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum have stalled below key resistance zones, failing to spark a broader rally in altcoins. This hesitation has intensified uncertainty, with some analysts calling for a deeper retracement in SOL if market leaders continue to slide. However, others remain optimistic that Solana could soon turn the tide. A key signal for Solana has emerged, with analyst Martinez reporting that the TD Sequential indicator printed a buy signal on the daily chart. Historically, this indicator has been a reliable precursor to significant local bottoms and bullish reversals, particularly when seen near strong support levels. With SOL recently experiencing a selloff and now stabilizing, this signal underscores the growing bullish potential. For now, Solana’s ability to hold above $145 will be key. A bounce from this level, combined with improving sentiment across large-cap assets, could trigger a fresh push toward $160 and beyond. If confirmed, such a move would signal that SOL is regaining strength and ready to retest higher resistance levels in the weeks ahead. Related Reading: Ethereum Stabilizes After Market Drop – Key MA Reclaim Could Trigger A June Rally SOL Retests Support After Prolonged Correction Solana (SOL) is trading at $148.44 after attempting a modest rebound from its recent local low near $145. The daily chart shows that SOL has lost momentum since peaking above $180 in late May, marking a 20% correction. Price is now holding just above the 100-day moving average (144.68), a key technical level that previously acted as support during consolidation phases. The 50-day and 34-day moving averages are now trending downward, with the 50-day SMA around $159.33 and the 34-day EMA near $159.35 — both acting as dynamic resistance. Meanwhile, the 200-day SMA remains higher at $177.49, reinforcing the presence of a strong overhead supply zone between $160 and $180. Despite the bearish pressure, volume has remained relatively muted during the recent drop, suggesting that panic selling hasn’t taken over yet. If SOL manages to hold above the $144–$145 region, this could form the base for a rebound, especially if broader market sentiment improves. Related Reading: Ethereum Mirrors Bitcoin 2020 Breakout Setup – Historic Run Incoming? A daily close back above the 34-EMA could open the door for a recovery toward $160.
