2025-06-08T11:39:48,"Bitcoin at the Brink: Double Top or $150K Moonshot, What’s Next?","Bitcoin is currently trading around $105,500, up a modest 1.1% in 24 hours, after a volatile week that saw prices swing between $100,400 and $106,500. While short-term price action appears calm, with the king cryptocurrency locked in a narrow 24-hour range of $103,500 to $105,800, underlying signals hint at seismic moves ahead. And with the asset now 6.2% down from its May 22 all-time high, the crypto community is divided: double top or liftoff? Double Top Déjà Vu? Pseudonymous analyst Cryptowizard took to X on June 7 with a chart comparison between Bitcoin’s current structure and the infamous 2021 double top. “Bitcoin’s price action is starting to look familiar,’” they wrote. “Just like in 2021, we’re seeing a potential double top formation plays out. Are we setting up for a retrace or $150K next?” That question has ignited debate across the community. Investor Trade Pro isn’t buying the bearish narrative. “Make no mistake about these pullbacks. I think they are buying opportunities… All signs point to strong continuation to new all-time highs,” they asserted, citing strong on-chain metrics. Backing that bullish case, Gracy Chen of Bitget says the macro picture is playing directly into Bitcoin’s hands. Trump’s latest 1% rate cut proposal and over $500 billion in expected U.S. Treasury borrowing by Q4 hint at a liquidity tsunami. “Globally, monetary easing is no longer a question of if, but when,” she noted, calling BTC the ultimate hedge in a world increasingly skeptical of fiat stability. “Bitcoin was built for these shifts.” Market watcher Axel Adler Jr. also noted that the 30-day volatility is now “highly compressed,” a setup that could just be the basis for a substantial market swing. Meanwhile, institutional buying continues to lock up supply. Swan CIO Ben Werkman pointed out that allocators, rather than traders, are driving this cycle, accumulating BTC without intent to sell. “62% of Bitcoin hasn’t moved in over a year,” noted Swan, suggesting that historic dormancy often precedes liftoff, as was the case in 2016 and 2020. Resistance Ahead? Still, not everyone is convinced the pump is near. According to Glassnode, at this time, the Short-Term Holder Cost Basis sits at just above $97,000 , with crucial thresholds at $83,200 and $114,800. The blockchain analytics firm predicts that a break below $100,000 could ignite another liquidation cascade, especially after Friday’s $988 million in long liquidations triggered by the very public tiff between U.S. President Donald Trump and his erstwhile political ally, Elon Musk. Even Daan Crypto Trade isn’t ruling out a deeper retracement. “Below yesterday’s lows at ~$100K and I think we’ll keep trending down for another 1–2 weeks,” he posted on X, pointing to BTC’s weakening correlation with stocks and a sluggish bounce from recent lows.

2025-06-08T11:30:00,"Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Picks Up Speed as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) Continue to Rise","As the crypto market gains renewed momentum, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are reclaiming key price levels, fueling optimism among investors. BTC is reaffirming their status as the best cryptocurrencies to invest in during this cycle. But as blue-chip coins steady the market, fresh capital is rotating into high-potential, new crypto Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , currently trading under $1 and drawing attention for its ambitious DeFi roadmap and projected 44x ROI potential. Over 11,700 investors own the token and has raised funds worth over $10.1 million. A lot of investors are investing at $0.03 since the next increase of 16.67%, to $0.035, is about to happen. Investors joining now are expecting a 100% return once the project goes live at a price of $0.06. MUTM is quickly becoming one of the best cryptos to buy now, especially for those eyeing the next big cryptocurrency before the next breakout. Bitcoin and Ethereum Maintain Momentum Amid Market Optimism The current price of Bitcoin (BTC) is $105,366 which is slightly higher by 0.02%. Ever since hitting its May low of $93,232, Bitcoin has rebounded and analysts say the $106,000–$106,500 range will act as strong resistance for the cryptocurrency. While writing, Ethereum (ETH) is trading above $2,628.42, adding around 0.52%. The coin is now toughing it out at a critical stage of $2,725, where it has met with challenges while progressing this week. Buying these cryptos right now is considered smart, because they open many opportunities for investors. Crypto investors are now paying more attention to upcoming altcoins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as high-potential investments. Mutuum Finance Presale Surges as Investor Interest Grows MUTM utilizes a two-way lending model that has made the project take center stage as far as speedy adoption by users is concerned. More than 11,700 investors have invested $10.1 million in the presale pointing to the success of the project. MUTM token will cost $0.035 in Phase 6 which means its price is set to appreciate by 16.67%. That presents investors with an opportunity for high returns. Through both market demand and strong lending approaches, Mutuum Finance is an intriguing DeFi project. Mutuum Finance’s Lending Platform Gains Trust as Certik Audit Wraps Up The Mutuum system brings together both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. With P2C, individuals can gain rewards from USDT pools and automated smart contracts and P2P gives them full power to handle direct cryptocurrency payments. Because of these factors, trading in DeFi has become safer, more convenient and more attractive for high-yield investors. Mutuum Finance is building a fully collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin to be issued on the Ethereum network. Its overcollateralized design ensures long-term price stability, avoiding the collapse risks that have affected algorithmic stablecoins. The platform is powered by open-source smart contracts that have now been officially audited and certified safe by Certik, providing a strong foundation for user trust and paving the way for institutional adoption. Rewarding Early Investors and Growing the Community Mutuum Finance is encouraging people to join by offering attractive rewards to early investors. Ten lucky participants in the ongoing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) $100,000 giveaway will be rewarded with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. Since Bitcoin and Ethereum have passed $105,000 and $2,000, respectively, investors believe in their continued growth. Along with this, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining attention after raising over $10.1 million from more than 11,700 participants in its presale. MUTM is currently $0.03 and it is forecasted to go up 16.67% very soon, so buying it now could potentially earn potential investors double their initial investment by purchasing at its initial offering of $0.03. Being able to lend money using a new system and providing a stablecoin makes it attractive in the world of DeFi. Thanks to these early supports and increasing appreciation, MUTM proves itself to be valued as much as BTC and ETH.

In a new interview on PBS’s Amanpour and Company, Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, says that the US government is in a situation where it absolutely must lower its budget deficit as a percentage of GDP from 7% to 3%. According to Dalio, the government must take a three-step approach to lowering the deficit-to-GDP ratio if it wants to avoid a “very high likelihood of real problems.” “It has to be done with three things, and it has to be spread out among these three things, because any one of those three things would be too painful. Those three things are tax revenue, spending cuts and interest rates. Although Congress and the president in the process does not deal directly with the third of those, right now a trillion dollars – half of our deficit – is interest payments, and not only do we have a trillion dollar interest payment, in the next year, we have nine trillion dollars of debt maturing that has to be either rolled over or sold… So there’s what I call my 3%, three-part solution, which was very similar to 1991-1998. It was cut by 5% of GDP, the budget deficit, in those years was cut by 5% of GDP by spreading it around. So those are the three things that are needed.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Meanwhile, a Trump crypto wallet controversy stirred infighting, and a Bitcoin-linked political scandal toppled the Czech Republic’s justice minister. Let’s find out more. Bitcoin The United States could be moving to deepen its engagement with El Salvador’s crypto leadership, as Bo Hines , executive director of the White House’s Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets, met with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele this week. https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/06/bitcoin-liquidity-boost-us-treasurys-10b-debt-buyback-spikes-crypto-market The largest U.S. Treasury buyback in history has taken place with a $10 billion purchase, resulting in Bitcoin spiking nearly $3,000 so far on Friday. Ethereum The Ethereum Foundation has announced a revised treasury management policy aimed at strengthening financial stability and safeguarding ecosystem funding in the face of crypto market volatility. BlackRock has liquidated $561 million in Bitcoin while acquiring $69 million worth of Ethereum, signaling a strategic institutional pivot amid shifting crypto market dynamics. Business Social media platform X, formerly Twitter, has officially partnered with Polymarket, a decentralized cryptocurrency prediction market, in a move aimed at blending real-time public conversation with on-chain forecasting. A dispute has broken out between various Trump-affiliated crypto ventures after a website claiming to represent an “official” Trump crypto wallet surfaced online, triggering public denials from the President’s family. Russia’s largest lender, Sberbank , has launched a new financial product tying investor returns to Bitcoin’s price performance and the U.S. dollar-to-ruble exchange rate, signaling Moscow’s growing engagement with cryptocurrency markets. Hong Kong-based Reitar Logtech Holdings Ltd. has announced plans to acquire up to $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin, marking one of the largest potential corporate crypto treasury allocations to date. Web3 Aurora Labs is beefing up the infrastructure side of its Cloud Console by debuting the Aurora Cloud Console Marketplace , which allows developers to create their own Virtual Chain and integrate dozens of tools and services, including identity solutions, data oracles, payments, compute, data layers and security systems, with just a few clicks.

The move followed a dip to $100,500 on June 5, but BTC/USD has since staged a steady recovery, nearing its weekly open. Bullish Momentum Reappears Popular analyst Rekt Capital noted signs of strength on the daily chart. “On the Daily timeframe, Bitcoin is showcasing signs of breaking its two-week Downtrend… while also turning it into support earlier today,” he said on X. He added that a daily close and retest around $106,600 would solidify a bullish continuation. Other traders, like SuperBro, also pointed to Bitcoin closing above its 10-day simple moving average as a positive sign. That metric, according to SuperBro, helps invalidate bearish scenarios. Liquidity Signals Suggest Imminent Volatility Trader Cas Abbe examined order book liquidity and observed building pressure both above and below spot price. He suggested this setup could lead to a “magnet-style” price move. “BTC liquidation cluster is now signalling an upside move,” he said. Abbe noted that a 10% price increase could liquidate $15.11 billion in shorts, while a 10% drop would impact $9.58 billion in longs. He also pointed to negative funding rates as evidence of mounting short positions. “I think BTC big move is coming next week, possibly pushing it above $109K–$110K,” he predicted. Key Support Levels Remain in Focus Some analysts are still preparing for a possible retest of lower support zones. Trader CrypNuevo said $100,000 remains a strong psychological support. “100k is the strongest psychological support… it’s the area where I’m building some longs with easy invalidation below it,” he explained. Rekt Capital Eyes Weekly Close Importance Rekt Capital also highlighted the importance of Bitcoin holding above $104,400 for a fourth consecutive weekly close. He described the retest following May’s all-time highs as “successful,” adding further weight to bullish sentiment.

Ardoino took to blogging platform X, saying that the stablecoin issuer has no such plans, days after its rival Circle made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Ardoino mentioned it while he was replying to a post about the company’s valuation. The post came days after Circle, which is behind the USDC stablecoin, entered the public market. Circle performed well on its first day, with its shares climbing 167% on its first trading session on the NYSE. The company’s shares opened at $31, before moving up by 235% in the first hours of negotiation, before closing at $82 at the end of the day. The performance showed that there is a growing market appetite for the stablecoin business. Tether CEO discusses Tether’s valuation Ardoino also addressed the speculation raised by Artemis CEO Jon Ma, who was speaking about Tether’s valuation. Ma mentioned that if Tether, who backs the USDT stablecoin were to go public, it would rank as the 19th largest company globally. He backed his claim with a table showing different companies and their current valuation. The table had companies like Microsoft, Nvidia, Apple, and Amazon, among others. Tether valuation at 515B is a beautiful number. Maybe a bit bearish considering our current (and increasing) Bitcoin + Gold treasury, yet I'm very humbled. Also truly excited for the next phase of growth of our company. Thank you everyone❤️ https://t.co/exZc05SDwd — Paolo Ardoino 🤖 (@paoloardoino) June 7, 2025 In his postulation, he noted that Tether, with a valuation of around $515 billion, will be larger than global giants like Costco and Coca-Cola. However, Ardoino was not impressed with the valuation. The Tether CEO noted that while the $515 billion valuation was a beautiful number, it might actually be too low for the company. “Maybe a bit bearish considering our current (and increasing) Bitcoin + gold treasury, yet I’m very humbled,” Ardoino said. Ardoino added that he is excited for the next stage of Tether’s growth . Meanwhile, popular Bitcoin advocate Anthony Pompliano also backed Ardoino’s stance, highlighting that the company has what it takes to hit the $1 trillion mark eventually. The stance was also shared by another prominent figure in the community, Jack Mallers, who mentioned that he hopes the company eventually reaches the valuation very soon. New inroads and investments Tether-backed stablecoin USDT currently ranks as the third-largest in the cryptocurrency market by market cap. It is valued at $154.83 billion at the time of writing, according to CoinMarketCap. The company has also been making investments in the crypto market, announcing in April that it would become a majority owner of Twenty One Capital, a new Bitcoin treasury company founded by Strike executive Jack Mallers. Despite its recent launch, Twenty One has become the third-largest holder of Bitcoin, coming behind Strategy (MicroStrategy) and mining firm MARA Holdings. Some days ago, Tether moved 37,229 Bitcoin, worth about $3.9 billion into the Bitcoin native financial platform. According to his post on X, he made three transactions totaling 25,812 BTC worth about $2.7 billion at the time before making a $730 million transfer and following it up with a $500 million BTC transfer. Twenty One Capital wants to develop Bitcoin-native capital markets infrastructure, allowing products like lending, custody, and asset issuance to operate directly on Bitcoin rails. It also has plans to go public using a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) merger that would involve Cantor Fitzgerald’s Cantor Equity Partners, which values the company at $3.6 billion.

Unless governments and regulators step in now (even then, the chances of controlling it are slim), AGI will escape the confines of its creators and autonomously hack cryptocurrency encryptions… and entire global digital systems. The rise of artificial intelligence AI has seen a dramatic surge in the commercial arena, one of its most recent iterations being AI agents. These are finely tuned, complicated systems, geared to perform specialized tasks and make decisions with minimal human intervention. Already transforming the tech space and becoming a useful everyday tool for many basic human interactions, such as self-driving cars, fraud detection , on-chain trading, and application creation. The next evolution will be AGI , a complex system that can do everything a human can. It will not need human prompts or intervention; it will simply have real-time autonomy: the ability to perform tasks, but also recognise when a task needs performing. This is set to be achieved in the next two years. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Elon Musk have made public statements declaring clear roadmaps to achieve AGI; regardless of who gets there first, time will decide whether they are a hero or the destroyers of worlds. Potential evolution of use cases: Friend and foe Alongside positive innovations, AI is facilitating amoral actors. LLMs and AI agents are being used to assist hacking. LLMs get jailbroken to produce malware and are being used for targeted scamming, such as faking voices in phone calls to incite money transfers from unsuspecting victims. An open-sourced AI Agent can be used by malicious actors for targeted scams, tasked with finding, tracking, tracing, and infiltrating a target—never ending until it achieves its goal. One key vulnerability on the horizon lies in the potential for AGI to break cryptographic encryptions. Bitcoin ( BTC ) encryption hacking is already a growing market, but is currently limited to the realm of quantum computing , which has an incredibly high barrier to entry—it requires extreme assets, resources, and technical capabilities that the average hacker does not possess. Crypto encryption hacking has been limited to a small handful of individuals who are legally paying for the services of quantum computing firms to unlock their wallets and recover funds for a hefty finder’s fee. Encryption hacking will not always be bound to the limits of quantum computing. AGI presents much lower barriers to entry and will leverage technology that man has not even yet discovered. AI + bad actors = death of crypto Once AI has advanced to the point where it can hack encryption, the level of criminals using this tool will dramatically increase. Usage will extend well beyond innocent crypto investors trying to recover funds. Hackers will use AI agents sufficiently advanced to target and exploit these weaknesses in our financial systems. Particularly as there are many amoral groups that lack quantum computing skills, actively interested in the weaponisation of AI, for example, the North Korean Lazarus Group, infamous for financial hacks , poses a real danger. We are looking at far more devastating effects than just scams and theft. North Korea will use it as a digital weapon, destroying existing financial systems. Beyond the weaponisation of AI by unfriendly states and actors lies the potential for AGI to go rogue from its creators. Once this happens, one of the first aspects after decentralizing itself, through infiltrating digital networks to become untraceable to avoid being switched off, will be to gather financial resources. The most likely target is the financial markets, specifically crypto. It would try to access digital capital by tracking high-frequency traders, forging accounts, and hacking online bank accounts. It would also break encryption methods for Bitcoin and all major cryptocurrencies. In the blink of an eye, it will be able to hack every single wallet that has ever existed and immediately secure the assets by selling them on the chain for gold, bonds, and fiat currencies, all before any centralised authority could respond. If an AI can crack all the private keys for crypto wallets, why would it not do so within minutes, stealing and selling all of the Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and then diversifying into other assets? It would, and it will. Any hope for crypto (and humankind)? Without proactive counter-strategies, AGI could dismantle cryptocurrencies and very quickly take control of all human finances. As a complex, non-deterministic system, AGI is a technology where the safety rails imposed by governments are most needed; managing these risks requires exceptional cooperation and sophistication across many actors and institutions. Yet this is the first time a world-changing technology has not been spearheaded by the government, but instead by private corporations. From the Manhattan Project to microprocessors, the internet, GPS, and digital cameras, these are all technologies that originated from government-run projects for defense, which were subsequently commercialized for consumers (except for the bomb). Silicon Valley is at the forefront of AI, placing us in a unique position in history where the scale and speed of distribution, versus government oversight, may not be sufficient to prevent major negative impacts. AI will transform society, but once AI proves extremely smart and capable, there will be little to stop the ‘wrong hands’ from developing harmful AI tools. AGI starts a countdown timer until it breaks free from its creator’s chains and moves into the real world. The risks are not exclusive to financial markets, but apply to the whole digital landscape, IoT devices, electrical grids, and so much more. Crypto is but a means to an end for AI, a means to gather wealth. Crypto is purely the financial vessel for the worst-case scenario to unfold.

Investors who once jumped on meme coins are now redirecting their focus to projects showing tangible infrastructure, scalability, and longevity. Nexchain stands out in this trend. The AI-powered Layer-1 blockchain has already raised $4 million in its ongoing Stage 17 presale, catching the attention of serious crypto backers. Unlike hype coins that lack sustainable models, Nexchain is building a real ecosystem for cross-industry blockchain adoption. Its combination of scalability, decentralization, and smart automation makes it a strong contender for one of the best crypto presales of the year. Nexchain Is the Future Layer-1 Blockchain You Can Buy Early Nexchain isn’t just promising innovation, it’s already delivering features that many other chains can’t yet match. At the core of its offering is a 10% daily gas fee revenue share distributed automatically to all token holders who use non-custodial wallets. This model turns passive holding into active earning, giving NEX tokens real-world yield from network activity rather than speculative rewards. With its hybrid AI + Proof-of-Stake consensus, Nexchain reaches over 400,000 TPS, making it one of the fastest blockchains available today. The chain supports smart contracts that can access real-time AI models and execute logic based on live data. This makes it ideal for powering AI applications across DeFi, supply chains, and decentralized healthcare.

2025-06-08T09:30:14,"Ethereum Prepares For A Parabolic Move – ETH/BTC Chart Signals Strong Bullish Setup","Ethereum has remained resilient over the past few weeks, holding firmly above key support levels despite a broader market pullback. While many altcoins have struggled to find direction, ETH continues to trade above the $2,500 zone — a level that has repeatedly served as a strong foundation during times of uncertainty. Now, all eyes are on the $2,800 mark, which stands as the critical resistance level that bulls must reclaim to confirm a breakout and reignite bullish momentum. The overall market remains in a wait-and-see mode, with volatility rising and macroeconomic risks clouding short-term confidence. But Ethereum’s structure remains intact, and price action continues to favor accumulation rather than breakdown. Top analyst Carl Runefelt recently shared a bullish outlook on Ethereum’s ETH/BTC pair, highlighting the formation of a textbook bullish pennant. According to his analysis, Ethereum is preparing for a parabolic move once it breaks out of this high-timeframe consolidation. A breakout on the ETH/BTC chart would likely signal altcoin strength across the board, with Ethereum leading the charge. Ethereum Eyes Breakout After Holding Critical Support Ethereum has seen a 14% retrace since the last week of May, but despite the pullback, it continues to hold firmly above the $2,400 support zone — a level that has acted as a floor during the recent correction. While market sentiment has been shaky, Ethereum’s ability to maintain this structure has analysts growing increasingly optimistic. The price action suggests consolidation rather than weakness, with bulls preparing for a potential breakout in the coming sessions. ETH remains down significantly from its yearly highs, but a recovery could be underway. The $2,800 resistance is now the critical barrier for a bullish continuation. Reclaiming that level would confirm a breakout from the current range and open the door to retesting the $3,000–$3,200 region. Some analysts argue that this recovery could mark the start of Ethereum catching up with Bitcoin’s lead, especially if it starts gaining strength in the ETH/BTC pair. Runefelt recently pointed to a bullish pennant forming on the ETH/BTC chart, suggesting that Ethereum may be on the verge of a parabolic move. The key level to watch is around 0.026 BTC. A confirmed breakout above this threshold could signal the start of altseason, as Ethereum tends to lead the way during major altcoin rotations. For now, ETH is at a critical crossroads. Holding above $2,400 gives bulls a strong foundation, but follow-through is needed. A breakout in both USD and BTC pairs would validate the bullish case and likely trigger broader upside across the altcoin market. With momentum building and a technical setup aligning, Ethereum’s next move could shape the market direction well into the summer. ETH Consolidates Below Resistance As Bulls Defend $2,430 Support Ethereum is trading at $2,516 on the daily timeframe, consolidating just below key resistance at the 200-day simple moving average (SMA), currently at $2,663. After a strong rally in May, ETH has entered a sideways range and is now retesting the 34-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $2,431 — a critical level that previously acted as a springboard for the most recent push higher. Despite several attempts, Ethereum has been unable to break above the $2,800 zone, forming a clear horizontal resistance capped by the 200-day SMA. This repeated rejection highlights growing selling pressure at the top of the range. However, the overall structure remains intact as long as ETH holds above $2,430. A daily close below this level could trigger further downside toward the 100-day SMA near $2,266. Volume has declined during this consolidation, suggesting a lack of conviction from both bulls and bears — a setup that typically precedes a breakout. If bulls can reclaim the 200-day SMA, momentum may quickly return, with $2,800 as the next critical breakout level.

2025-06-08T09:30:11,"Ethereum Head & Shoulders Pattern Breakdown: Can Bulls Reclaim Control?","Ethereum’s recent price action on the 4-hour chart has led to the formation of a classic Head and Shoulders pattern that opens up the possibility of a deeper correction. After a relatively stable period around the $2,500 zone, Ethereum broke below a neckline support level as last week drew to a close. This raises the question of whether a bearish continuation is already in motion for the Ethereum price or if bulls still have a shot at regaining momentum in the new week. Related Reading: Elon Musk ‘Will Do Anything’ To Make XRP King, Tech Mogul Says Head & Shoulders Pattern Confirmed After Breakdown Below $2,480 The Head and Shoulders pattern, one of the most recognizable reversal formations in technical analysis, is now clearly visible on Ethereum’s 4-hour candlestick chart. This chart and the technical outlook were first shared on the TradingView platform by crypto analyst MelikaTrader94. The structure includes a left shoulder, a prominent head peaking above $2,700, and a right shoulder that topped near $2,650. The neckline, drawn around $2,480, was breached during Ethereum’s recent pullback to $2,380. This, in turn, shifted the short-term outlook toward the bearish side. After the break, Ethereum attempted to reclaim lost ground and is currently retesting the neckline area. This retest around $2,500 is significant, as a failure to push back above this level significantly would likely validate the bearish setup and cause the Ethereum price to reverse downwards toward the next support zone. According to the outlook from analyst MelikaTrader94, the price target from this Head and Shoulders breakdown before any notable rebound upward can occur lies between $2,200 and $2,250. Chart Image From TradingView: MelikaTrader94 Bulls Must Reclaim $2,650 To Invalidate Bearish Setup A confluence of factors supports the $2,200 region as a likely landing zone. Not only is this level consistent with the measured move of the Head and Shoulders pattern, but it also aligns with an order block on May 9 during Ethereum’s rally above $2,000 at the time. This adds further technical relevance to the $2,200 to $2,250 range acting as a support zone. However, the situation is not fully bearish yet. The path forward is clear but narrow for Ethereum bulls. The first step to invalidate the bearish setup is to reclaim the neckline around $2,500 decisively. Beyond that, breaking back above the right shoulder level around $2,650 would invalidate the Head and Shoulders pattern, and another pattern will most likely come into play.

Analyst Highlights The Trigger A successful bullish reclaim would not only nullify the bearish pattern but could also revive sentiment for another retest of the $2,700 to $2,800 zone, which corresponds to the peak of the head in the recently formed pattern. Until such a recovery occurs, the Ethereum price can quickly reverse downwards at any time. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,510.

2025-06-08T09:30:00,"Treasuries are stacking Bitcoin: PR gimmick or solid strategy?","As Bitcoin continues its rise into mainstream finance, a growing number of public companies are adding the cryptocurrency to their treasuries — but not without controversy. While firms like MicroStrategy and Metaplanet are going all-in on Bitcoin ( BTC ) accumulation, others are cautiously experimenting, often as a hedge against inflation, rising interest rates, and fiat debasement. Yet critics warn that many of these companies are financially shaky, using the coin more as a speculative lifeline than a strategic asset. Analysts are split between seeing this trend as forward-thinking financial engineering or a “dumpster fire.” The rise of corporate Bitcoin treasuries reflects both the promise and peril of crypto’s expanding influence in global capital markets. According to BitBo , as of June 6, over 70 public companies were holding Bitcoin. It’s understood that companies like Strategy and Metaplanet are fully dedicated to accumulation. However, some other corporations are dipping their toes into Bitcoin stacking while continuing to work in a different sphere. Serious question: How many of these random companies stacking BTC on their balance sheet are just doing it for the PR? — Nic (@nicrypto) June 5, 2025 ‘Dumpster fire in the making’ Journalist and analyst Sean Williams expressed his concerns over the possible failure of the Bitcoin treasury companies, citing the lack of innovation and operational success as the drivers of the potential bust. He called the BTC treasury hype a “dumpster fire in the making.” He pointed out that many companies resorting to launching a BTC treasury are not profitable in the first place, so they try to make quick money out of crypto volatility. This emphasizes their weaknesses. Strategy’s stock performance was one of the worst in February 2025. He named several instances when the BTC price saw significant downfalls as an example of the potential risk for such companies. On top of that, Williams sees the scarcity and 21 million hard cap narratives as “mythical” due to the potential possibility of changing the BTC limit. Technically, it’s not impossible. When BlackRock outlined such a possibility in the company’s educational animation, the reaction from Bitcoin maximalists was antagonistic. Coin Bureau founder Nic Puckrin on X expressed doubts that the “random” companies launching Bitcoin treasuries won’t sell their BTC in the bear market. Thus, he brings up these companies’ alleged superficial engagement in Bitcoin and warns about the potential harm to the crypto market.

While some veterans could get annoyed by seeing their favorite crypto gets “appropriated” by the new players with money, the reasons for adopting corporate Bitcoin treasuries have strong macroeconomic grounds. In an in-depth study , Fidelity analysts note that the last five years saw an increase in publicly traded companies that allocate part of their capital in Bitcoin, which is seen as a hedge against increasing fiscal deficits, fiat currency debasement, and risks associated with geopolitical turbulence. Fidelity emphasizes that this approach is unorthodox for big companies, as in previous decades, they held their funds in low-risk assets, such as bank deposits or treasury bills. According to Fidelity, the growing economic uncertainty undermined trust in traditional strategies. Corporate treasuries’ need for uncorrelated capital grew in the 2020s as interest rates hit high, reducing liquidity and cash flows. However, if the interest rate drops, the yields of companies having substantial reserves of traditional funds will also go down. The study calls the response to COVID-19 “unprecedented” as the cumulative stimulus payments of the biggest economies amounted to $10 trillion, which is three times higher than during the 2008 crisis period. Inflation rates surged, causing a decline in corporate treasuries’ purchasing power. These factors made many investors look for new solutions, and soon many, including public companies, saw a solution in Bitcoin. Given that the regulations in the EU and the U.S. have been Bitcoin-friendly, investors started to accumulate digital assets with more confidence. The study mentions such regulations including: The Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval of Bitcoin ETFs The EU’s MiCA framework adoption The Financial Accounting Standards Board’s rule change from 2023, which allowed Bitcoin holding companies to account for and represent value in their financial statements more precisely. Considering the ascending Bitcoin price, it made companies’ balance sheets look stronger. As Bitcoin has been resistant to demand shocks and could serve as a financial cushion in the long run, it promised benefits for companies adding the coin to their balance sheets. According to Fidelity, Bitcoin can help companies survive the monetary debasement policy of central banks due to its verifiable scarcity. Analysts generally note that Bitcoin’s long-term price appreciation was one of the main reasons for its popularity among corporations. The study names the companies pioneering allocation: The Block, MicroStrategy, Stone Ridge Holdings Group, and Selmer Scientific. ‘Crash test’ FOMO and game theory are often mentioned when people discuss reserves. These reserves cut the live liquidity, increasing an asset’s deficit on the markets while not necessarily pumping the price (as people quickly got used to “bullish” announcements). The trend is pretty young, and it needs to undergo a crash test so we can see if the companies stacking bitcoins are not the “tourists.” You might also like: BlackRock nears Satoshi Nakamoto in Bitcoin, tops Strategy and Binance",crypto_news,https://crypto.news/treasuries-stacking-bitcoin-gimmick-solid-strategy/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Follow-up|BlackRock|education|Fidelity Investments|MicroStrategy",cryptocompare

2025-06-08T09:15:55,"Michael Saylor Doubling Down on Bitcoin Price Prediction As BTC Holds $100,000 Level","The former chief executive of the software firm Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, is doubling down on his massive price prediction for Bitcoin ( BTC ) as it continues to trade above the six-figure level. In a new interview with CNBC Television, Bitcoin firebrand Michael Saylor says that as institutions enter the top crypto asset by market cap, BTC should experience a supply shock and a surge in price. “There’s been a surge of Bitcoin treasury companies. There’s like 100 public companies or more. They’re holding Bitcoin on their balance sheet. And every single week, there’s another announcement. I think that it used to be that we’re focused on the halvings. But at this point, the entire natural supply of Bitcoin is only 450 Bitcoin available for sale every day. That’s sort of about $45 – $50 million a day at this level. That is all being consumed by the Bitcoin treasury companies. And the Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) are coming on strong. So I’m very bullish.” Saylor goes on to slightly upgrade his price prediction for the flagship digital asset, noting that he believes it will outpace other key asset classes, such as real estate and the S&P 500. “My forecast in July of last year in Nashville was Bitcoin’s going to appreciate 29% a year on average for the next 21 years. And that moves it from it was about mid $60s, $65,000 to $13 million a coin in the year 2045. I’m getting more bullish on that forecast, but I’m certainly comfortable forecasting 30% a year ARR (annual recurring revenue) on average for the next 20 years. I think Bitcoin’s up 57% a year for the past four and a half years. Again, that’s double the Mag seven. That’s quadruple the S&P. That’s eight times real estate and bonds are down 4%. So Bitcoin is smashing everything.” Strategy is currently the world’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, coming in at 580,955 BTC worth just over $61.3 billion, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries. Bitcoin is trading for $105,431 at time of writing, a fractional decrease on the day.

2025-06-08T09:05:49,"Japan introduces revised ‘crypto-friendly’ Payment Services Act - What should investors expect?","The upper house of Japan’s National Diet passed the revised Payment Services Act (PSA) on Friday, resulting in big changes ahead for enterprises dealing with crypto. The new category of “intermediary business” alleviates the need for middleman companies in Japan to register as exchanges, but the bill has other implications, some of which bring stricter rules and greater centralization. Originally submitted to the Japan Diet back in March, the amendments to the Payment Services Act passed on Friday , and are being praised as pro-crypto.Perhaps drawing the most attention is the establishment of a new category of “intermediary business,” meaning businesses who introduce or act as liaisons between exchangers and users. Such groups will no longer have to register as an exchange with the government’s regulator, the Financial Services Agency (FSA).A separate registration, with relaxed rules, will be introduced for these intermediaries. Image: Chihiro Sakai . What’s in the new law: Stablecoins, intermediary businesses, emergency outflow barriers Under FSA discussion since November last year, the amended Payment Services Act is being cited by regional media as likely removing barriers for gaming companies and others that want to do business related to cryptocurrency and digital assets.Interest from Mercari, SBI Securities, and Monex Securities has already been reported regarding registering as an “intermediary business.”Some key changes to the act are as follows: Creation of “intermediary” businesses with relaxed registration rules. Creation of a separate registration system for exchanges. New ability to issue a legal order requiring overseas-based crypto firms to hold assets in Japan to prevent outflows in case of bankruptcy. “Trust-type” stablecoin backing assets can now be held partially (up to 50%) in low-risk investments like government bonds, instead of being 100% backed in fiat by the issuer. Stricter rules for businesses deemed overseas “collection agencies” providing e-commerce services. FSA chart detailing changes to trust-type stablecoin regulations. Source: FSA . The amended law, set to take effect within one year, essentially cements strict AML/CFT requirements and rules for registered exchange operators and e-commerce collection agencies, eases entry to the regulated crypto ecosystem for liaison businesses (which must be under the supervision of a registered operator), prevents overseas exchanges from running off with Japanese users’ money, and helps banks issue stablecoins more easily. Centralization, stricter rules — Drifting further from Satoshi While it’s understandable that gaming enterprises and others are happy to hear the news of the amendment’s success, and removal of barriers to entry, Tokyo and Japan-based adherents to Satoshi Nakamoto’s original idea of separation of money and state will see the law as a nothing-burger. Or a poison apple, more accurately.Massive banks can now issue stablecoins more easily, leveraging state credit, while overseas, permissionless markets and competitors are further targeted as threats.As Coinpost reported in 2022 of a Mitsubishi UFJ working group focused on stablecoins: “The aim is to put a stop to the current situation in which funds are flowing mainly into overseas stablecoins, including through investment in overseas Web3 (decentralized app) projects, use of major NFT markets, and even cover trading in cryptocurrency exchanges.” Businesses that handle money deemed cross-border “collection agencies” involved with activities such as e-commerce can also be regulated under the revised PSA. Source: FSA . Crackdown on foreign payment agents deemed cross-border “collection agencies,” such as those involved with e-commerce, is a slippery slope. The FSA notes it will not go after low-risk activities or require registration from low-risk intermediaries, while threatening a crackdown on online casinos and fraud, noting that “Those who conduct illegal remittances, such as online casinos and investment fraud, will be subject to regulation as unregistered businesses” under the new amendment.As with all legislation, arbitrary political interpretation allows for endless abuse. Previously, cross-border collection agencies were not required to register as a funds transfer business with the state. Now, they must rely on the FSA’s assurances only, in a state of relative limbo.Fortunately for the advocates of peer-to-peer, permissionless transactions, no matter what the new regulations bring, use of actual crypto — not regulated, bank-issued stablecoins — remains one path toward economic freedom and peace in Japan, in a time of a faltering yen, rice shortages , and mainstream monetary malaise.

The FCA had banned ETNs in January 2021 , citing their volatility and complexity for retail investors. However, because we’re seeing increasing warmth towards cryptocurrency across the globe, the UK doesn’t want to be left behind. Keep reading to find out more about the UK’s decision regarding ETNs, how the US also has major pro-crypto legislation in the works, and what the best crypto to buy now is in light of these developments. UK & UK Embrace Crypto For those unaware, an ETN is a debt security instrument offered by recognized entities. Its value is tied to an underlying asset, which, in the case of crypto, is a specific coin. As the price of the underlying asset goes up, the price of the ETN will also increase, and vice versa. It’s worth noting that crypto ownership in the UK has increased from 18% in 2024 to 24% in 2025 . This is more than that of the US. Naturally, a growth like this calls for a comprehensive regulatory design to regulate the ownership and use of digital assets in the country. Meanwhile, in the US, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act is expected to go for a floor vote soon enough. The GENIUS Act aims to regulate various aspects of stablecoins, such as permitted issuers, transparency, consumer protection, federal and state-level oversight authority, and legal classification. All in all, a friendlier regulatory environment will lead to a more thriving crypto market. Bitcoin recently made an all-time high of $112K , and with positive and proactive legislative support, it might soon hit $150K, too. To hop on the crypto train and make the most of its momentum, consider investing in the following altcoins. 1. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Best Crypto to Buy Now, the Fastest and Most Affordable Trading Bot Increased crypto adoption will directly impact the growth of meme coins, which is already among the most profitable niches of the crypto space. As a result, Snorter Token could see massive growth in the coming weeks. It’s a Telegram-native trading bot designed to snipe (buy) the best meme coins as soon as they’re launched using a contact address or pool ID. This way, it will help you outsmart the bots and whales circling like sharks in the crypto market. Snorter Bot is mighty secure, too. It’s got honeypot and rugpull detection, mint trap detection, real-time blacklist scans, and freeze alerts. Other useful features include copy-trading tools, portfolio tracking, and the lowest trading fees (just 0.85%) of all competitors if you hold $SNORT. You can become an early investor in this awesome meme coin with real utility by buying into its presale. The Snorter Token presale is fairly new but has still managed to raise over $575K. Each token is currently priced at just $0.0947. 2. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Bitcoin-Themed Meme Coin Offering Free $BTC Airdrops BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) will help you directly benefit from Bitcoin’s upcoming bull run, but at a fraction of the cost. It’ll do so in two ways: First, you’ll profit from a substantial increase in $BTCBULL’s price. According to our predictions, BTC Bull Token can reach $0.0096 by 2026 – a 3.7x jump from its current price of $0.00255. Second, you’ll benefit from BTC Bull Token’s free Bitcoin airdrops. A striking feature, the aforementioned $BTC airdrops will take place when Bitcoin reaches $150K and $200K for the very first time. However, only those who hold their $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet and participate in the airdrop events on social media will be eligible for free $BTC. Even better for $BTCBULL owners, the project will regularly shave off a part of the token supply. This will increase the crypto’s demand, which would then, in all likelihood, crank up its price. Buy BTC Bull Token now for just $0.00255 each. The project has emerged as one of the best crypto presales , with nearly $7M in early investor funding. 3. KoKoK The Roach ($KOKOK) – Viral New Meme Coin with Massive Potential KoKoK The Roach ($KOKOK) is a new meme coin that launched towards the end of May but has risen to become a force to reckon with in the entire crypto space. $KOKOK is up over 310% since its inception , including a chunky 28% gain over just the past seven days. This fascinating ‘disgusting’ meme coin is proof that degens have enough love to share with other animals, too, besides cute dogs, cats, and frogs. ‘The King of the Drain Pipes’ might be a fitting description for $KOKOK, but the fact remains that it could soon surge past its all-time high of around $0.20 and become one of the greatest meme coins of this year. It’s currently trading at $0.1724, with a market capitalization of $35M and a trading volume of $1.13M (up 110% over the past 24 hours).

BiT Global has “definitively” dropped its lawsuit filed in the Northern District Court of California, meaning it cannot be refiled. Under the agreement, each side will cover its own legal fees. BiT Global claimed in a lawsuit filed last year that Coinbase had unjustifiably delisted wBTC, damaging the token’s liquidity and reputation. The company claimed that Coinbase aimed to highlight its own competing product, cbBTC, with this decision. Related News: Yet Another Hack Attack: Significant Losses Reported for These Altcoins Coinbase defended its decision to delist, stating that the token posed an “unacceptable risk” and that it was concerned that “it could end up in Justin Sun’s hands.” Chinese-born cryptocurrency billionaire Justin Sun became associated with wBTC through his partnership with BiT Global in August of last year. Following this development, Coinbase began to question Sun’s role in the project. Interestingly, after Sun joined the project as an advisor, World Liberty Financial abandoned cbBTC and resumed supporting wBTC. However, the lawsuit did not provide any additional details about the content of the agreement. The parties only agreed that they would cover their own legal costs. *This is not investment advice.

Here’s How","XRP has faced heightened market uncertainty in recent weeks, with its value fluctuating after briefly losing a critical support level. After falling below $2.20, the asset staged a minor recovery, stabilizing near $2.17. These shifts have sparked renewed discussion about XRP’s long-term performance. While many traders adjusted their positions following the dip, one market participant has chosen to maintain a firm stance. Known publicly as Crypto Beast (@cryptobeastreal), the trader revealed that he holds a sizable XRP position and has no plans to reduce or liquidate it. According to information he shared, Crypto Beast owns approximately 1.83 million XRP, acquired at an average cost of $0.836. This suggests the purchase was made before the November 2024 price surge, when XRP began a remarkable climb. This climb culminated in a multi-year peak of $3.39, but Crypto Beast did not sell any of his tokens during or after the price surge. Never sold my XRP If XRP reaches $5.45 this will be worth $10 million dollars. Smaller than my $16 million ETH bag, but still alot of money. I’ll keep you updated on my position. pic.twitter.com/2dwQrr75rY — Crypto Beast (@cryptobeastreal) June 6, 2025 The $10 Million XRP Gain Target At the time of his public update, XRP was priced at around $2.13, bringing the value of his investment to roughly $3.9 million. Despite having gained more than $2.3 million in unrealized profit, the trader indicated that his objective is a portfolio value of $10 million. To meet this target, XRP would need to reach $5.45 per token, a 151% increase from current market levels. Experts have recently spotted bullish technical indicators on the XRP’s chart, and a popular analyst has predicted that the digital asset will soon make more millionaires , potentially setting the stage for Crypto Beast to fulfill his goal. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Crypto Beast’s investment is fully allocated on the spot market, meaning there is no exposure to forced liquidations due to leverage. This allows him to hodl through downturns without facing mandatory position closures. Holding for the Long Term Spot holdings are stable, unlike high-leverage trades. James Wynn, who became famous for PEPE gains, lost a total of $125 million via high-leverage Bitcoin trades on Hyperliquid after sharp corrections triggered massive liquidations of his long position. This event shocked the crypto world. Some have referenced it as a sign of market manipulation by exchanges . Some commentators have encouraged investors to adopt a long-term outlook. Figures like Edoardo Farina have advised accumulating XRP, revealing that he doesn’t intend to sell significant amounts until the asset hits $100 . He has also advised investors to move their tokens to cold storage , protecting their investments from manipulation or loss due to problems with exchanges. Investors who follow his advice may become millionaires like Crypto Beast if XRP rises. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Since most altcoins are quite sluggish on a daily scale, we will examine in more detail their weekly performances, where TAO and CRO stand in one corner, while HYPE, LEO, ICP, and TRX are in the other. BTC Above $105K The world’s largest cryptocurrency tried to break out at the beginning of the business week from its consolidation range but was stopped at $106,000 and $106,500 on Monday and Tuesday. The following rejections drove it south to the lower boundary, but the bulls went on the offensive once again on Thursday. However, bitcoin was stopped once again at $106,000, but this time, the correction was a lot more violent. Perhaps influenced by the ongoing spat between US President Trump and Tesla CEO Musk, BTC’s price tumbled hard and went to a multi-week low of $100,400 (on Bitstamp). As it came close to a breakdown below the coveted $100,000 level, the situation reversed and bitcoin started to recover some ground. By Friday noon, it had rebounded to around $105,000. Slightly more volatility followed, but BTC was ultimately stopped at $106,000 yesterday and now trades around $500 lower. Its market capitalization has risen to just shy of $2.1 trillion, while its dominance over the alts stands tall at 61.5%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts Up and Down The weekly scale shows that HYPE has emerged as the top gainer, having surged by almost 9%. As a result, the high-flyer now sits above $35, just less than $5 away from its recent peak. ICP follows suit with an 8% weekly increase, while LEO, TRX, and AAVE are next. On the opposite scale are TAO (-11%), GT (-5.3%), and CRO (-5.2%). SOL, DOGE, ADA, AVAX, and SHIB are also about to close the weekly candle in the red. The total crypto market cap has added around $30 billion since yesterday and is up to $3.410 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

2025-06-08T08:09:21,"BJMining Unveils XRP-Paid Cloud Mining Contracts as Bitcoin Tops $110K and XRP Adoption Accelerates","In May 2025, the digital-asset market is roaring again: Bitcoin’s price has comfortably held above $110,000 , while XRP is accelerating into mainstream payments—its on-chain daily volume has surpassed $400 million , and numerous global payment platforms and financial institutions are integrating XRP settlement. Industry data shows institutional XRP payment pilots have grown from around 50 at the end of last year to over 200 today, reflecting strong demand for its fast, low-cost transactions. However, building and maintaining your own mining farm or node remains a high barrier—hardware purchases, electricity bills, and ongoing ops can cost tens of thousands of dollars, and uncertain returns deter many investors.
