2025-06-08T15:30:17,"Bitcoin DeFi Project ALEX Protocol Targeted In $8.3 Million Exploit","Bitcoin decentralized finance (DeFi) platform ALEX Protocol has recently suffered an attack, losing $8.3 million in user funds. This represents the second exploit of the Stacks-based project in just over a year following a previous heist by the notorious North Korean Lazarus hackers group from North Korea. ALEX Protocol Falls Victim To Self-Listing Verification Flaw In an X post on June 6, the development team behind the ALEX Protocol announced the DeFi project experienced an exploit due to a vulnerability in its self-listing verification logic i.e. a security mechanism meant to prevent unauthorized asset listings. A failure is this security system could potentially allow bad actors to introduce malicious, unauthorized or fake assets to the ALEX protocol which can be exchanged for legitimate assets. By slipping past the self-verification logic, hackers were able to drain several asset pools making away with 8,403,867.57 Stacks (STX), valued at $5,691,255.93, 21.85 sBTC ($2,244,751.87), 149,850 USDC/USDT ($149,850), and 2.80 WBTC ($287,369.33) leading to a total haul of $8,373,227.13. ALEX Protocol Announces Compensation Plan Following this recent cyber attack, the developers behind ALEX Protocol has pledged to cover all user losses using the ALEX Lab Foundation Treasury. All compensation will be paid in USDC and based on the average on-chain exchange value of the stolen assets at the time of the exploit between 10:00 UTC – 14:00 UTC on June 6,2025. By 23:59 UTC on June 8, all affected wallets should have received a private on-chain notification alongside a claim form. The claimants are expected to fill the form which should include a receiving wallet address before proceeding to submit ahead of the deadline on June 10 by 23:59 UTC. The ALEX Protocol management team further states that all affected wallets should expect a full compensation within seven days after the submitted form is verified. It is worth stating that all victims with questions or those who fail to receive notification email before specified deadline are advised to reach out via the email stated in the announcement. The ALEX Protocol is built on the Bitcoin network using the Stacks blockchain. It is a popular DeFi platform offering a range of services, including lending, borrowing, and trading. Additionally, ALEX supports cross-chain bridges, enabling users to transfer assets seamlessly from other networks such as Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain.As earlier stated, the DeFi project had suffered a previous exploit in May 2024 when the Lazarus group withdrew $4.5 million through the platform’s bridge on the BNB Smart Chain Network.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-defi-project-alex-protocol-in-8-3m-exploit/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Crypto News|ALEX Protocol|bitcoin|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Crypto heist|DeFi|Stacks Blockchain",cryptocompare
2025-06-08T15:30:13,"Bitcoin Leveraged Traders Are Back Betting On A Price Decline — What This Means","The price of Bitcoin has been in a good recovery form since succumbing to the bearish pressure from the ongoing feud between United States President Donald Trump and Elon Musk. The premier cryptocurrency climbed above the $105,000 mark in the early hours of Saturday, June 7. According to the latest on-chain data, the Bitcoin price looks set to continue its upward trajectory over the next few days. What Negative Leveraged Traders’ Sentiment Means For Price In a new post on the X platform, data analytics firm Alphractal shared fresh on-chain insights into the recent movement of the Bitcoin price. According to the market intelligence firm, the major catalyst of BTC’s latest recovery is the sudden shift in the market sentiment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Golden Cross Pattern Says The Crash To $100,000 Is Normal – What To Expect Next This on-chain observation is based on the Leveraged Traders’ Sentiment, which tracks the outlook or positioning of leveraged traders in the market. It provides insight into the kind of bets (longs or shorts) that leveraged traders are placing in the crypto market and the funding rates of the derivatives market. Data from Alphractal shows a rising interest in opening short positions in the Bitcoin market, with most retail traders betting on a price decline. Ultimately, this on-chain trend suggests that the sentiment in the Bitcoin derivatives market is currently bearish. However, Alphractal noted that this kind of behavior might not be as straightforward as it looks, as the market historically tends to move in the crowd’s opposite direction. Hence, when several traders are betting on a Bitcoin price decline, the flagship cryptocurrency tends to witness a contrasting market bounce. Alphractal said: When sentiment becomes excessively bullish or bearish, the market tends to do the opposite. Therefore, this metric is not just a sentiment gauge — it’s also a warning signal for potential contrarian moves that often catch traders off guard. According to the analytics firm, this is exactly what is currently happening in the Bitcoin market, with the market leader bouncing back despite the negative traders’ sentiment. Interestingly, if these leveraged traders continue to bet against Bitcoin, the BTC price could potentially ride this fresh bullish momentum to a new all-time high. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, BTC is valued at around $105,700, reflecting an almost 2% increase in the past 24 hours. Following the latest resurgence, the premier cryptocurrency is now up by more than 1% on the weekly timeframe.

2025-06-08T15:22:00,"Under-the-radar Mutuum Finance crypto project expected to cross $2 mark","The crypto market has recently witnessed a massive surge, with the price of Bitcoin (BTC) recently surging to a new all-time high above $110k. The surge led to many flashy headlines, with many newbie investors joining Bitcoin (BTC) near the top. However, seasoned investors know the best entry point into the crypto market is to find projects bursting at the seams with potential like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) before they make the headlines. Let us take a closer look at Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and why analysts are so excited about its future. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is poised for huge gains Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the most exciting crypto projects in a long time. It represents shifting investor interest from meme coins to projects that offer long-term value to their community. The project, which is built as a decentralized non-custodial protocol, allows users to participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. As a lender, users have a chance to earn interest on their idle assets by depositing them in a pool. The interest earned is determined by the pool’s utilization rate and can quickly add up based on the asset type and the demand from borrowers. To ensure the long-term solvency of the platform, Mutuum Finance has introduced several notable technical innovations. Thoughtful asset integration process The crypto market is massive, and crypto assets come in all different flavors. Mutuum Finance aims to ensure that users of the platform have the best options possible. In line with this philosophy, the team has a long list of metrics that it uses to determine if an asset should be added to the platform. These checks include: Transaction costs Each asset added to the protocol introduces a new level of code complexity, which pushes up the gas fee. The goal of Mutuum Finance is to strike a balance between offering users as many options as possible while keeping costs as low as possible. Volatility and liquidity Assets with high volatility and low liquidity could potentially impact the solvency of the protocol. To avoid this issue, Mutuum Finance will conduct an in-depth assessment to determine the suitability. Based on the assessment, some tokens may be added in an isolated or restricted model. By vigorously checking tokens and creating specialized frameworks for some tokens, they ensure that users have access to a diverse list of assets while still protecting the protocol’s solvency. Centralization check Mutuum Finance will check whether an asset has issues with centralization before it is added. Assets that are under the control of a single entity could potentially be shut down at a moment’s notice, impacting the overall stability of the protocol. Before adding a token, the team will weigh user demand compared to the overall solvency of the protocol. Oracle manipulation checks The Mutuum Finance project will also add safeguards against oracle manipulation. If a digital asset is found to have an unreliable price oracle, it may be accepted, but with massive restrictions. For instance, it could be placed in non-collateral status. Limiting how such an asset can be used ensures there is a safeguard against exploits that rely on sudden price changes. When an asset is restricted from being used as collateral, its impact on solvency is more limited. The reason for this is that collateral represents the protocol’s assets. As such, those holding the assets must over-collateralize their position to maintain solvency. If an asset is restricted from being used as collateral, the position needs to be excessively backed by high-quality assets. Once assets are accepted on the platform, various metrics will be used to monitor them, such as liquidation thresholds, loan-to-value, and liquidation bonuses. These metrics can be tweaked to ensure that a token does not impact the solvency of the protocol when market dynamics change. MUTM presale performance Based on the technical ingenuity in creating the Mutuum Finance project, the MUTM token presale has attracted overwhelming support. So far, over $10.1 million has been raised. So far, over 11,700 unique buyers have secured their tokens and are looking forward to the listing, when their value could explode 10x or more. The presale is in phase 5, where tokens are going for $0.03. In Phase 4, the token price was $0.025 and has since increased by 20%. The price is set to increase 16.67% to $0.035. This stepped increase ensures that the earliest supporters will enjoy the greatest benefits. Do not let this opportunity pass you by. With a planned listing price of $0.06, current participants in the Phase 5 presale stand to make a 100% ROI when the tokens are listed. Analysts predict that the price could rise to as high as $2 once the tokens go live.

2025-06-08T14:58:00,"Bitcoin Family Hides Crypto Seed Phrases Across Four Continents After Kidnapping Threats","Key Takeaways: The Bitcoin Family now hides their crypto seed phrases across four continents amid growing kidnapping threats. Recent violent attacks on crypto holders have triggered new personal security measures in the industry. Crypto executives are increasingly hiring private security. A wave of violent kidnappings targeting cryptocurrency holders is pushing some of the industry’s most well-known figures to overhaul their security — including Didi Taihuttu, patriarch of the so-called “Bitcoin Family.” Taihuttu, who famously sold everything in 2017 to go all-in on Bitcoin, revealed that his family has abandoned hardware wallets and now hides their crypto seed phrases across four continents. The shift follows a string of threats and rising attacks on crypto holders worldwide. Even at Gunpoint Attackers Would Get Little “We have changed everything,” Taihuttu told CNBC from Thailand . “Even if someone held me at gunpoint, I can’t give them more than what’s on my phone wallet — and that’s not much.” Over the past eight months, the family moved to a hybrid system: seed phrases are encrypted, split, and stored in both physical and digital formats. Some parts are etched onto fireproof steel plates hidden across four continents. Others are stored via blockchain-based encryption services. “You only need to remember which words you changed,” Taihuttu explained. The system ensures that even if attackers access part of the seed phrase, they cannot unlock the family’s full holdings. The decision comes as physical attacks on crypto holders increase. Moroccan police this week arrested a suspect accused of kidnapping crypto executives. In France, the father of a crypto millionaire was brutally attacked . And in New York, a tourist was tortured for over two weeks as kidnappers tried to extract his Bitcoin credentials. Three British men kidnapped a UK crypto trader in Spain Demanding a €30K ransom. The victim managed to call a friend, who alerted the police Leading to a dramatic rescue. (5/9) pic.twitter.com/8B7OqwnIta — StarPlatinum (@StarPlatinumSOL) May 13, 2025 The Taihuttus, who remain entirely unbanked and travel full-time with their three daughters, say they are rethinking even their public presence. After strangers tracked their residence through YouTube videos, they stopped posting travel updates and moved homes. “We got a little bit famous in a niche market — but that niche is becoming a big market now,” Taihuttu said, noting the family has decided to avoid traveling to France altogether. About 65% of their crypto is now locked in cold storage across four continents. The rest remains in multi-signature wallets or decentralized exchanges for trading and daily spending. Taihuttu said they avoid centralized vaults and services, preferring to retain full control. “What happens if one of those companies goes bankrupt? You’re putting your capital back in someone else’s hands,” he said. Crypto Executives Hire Bodyguards As reported, crypto executives are turning to personal security services as targeted kidnappings and ransom attempts continue to escalate, particularly in France. In May, private security firms such as Infinite Risks International, based in Amsterdam, reported a sharp increase in demand from crypto professionals seeking round-the-clock protection amid rising crypto kidnapping. The rise in inquiries came a after spate of violent attacks, including multiple kidnappings attempts that have alarmed both investors and law enforcement.

2025-06-08T14:53:45,"Trump Media Commits 3 Billion Dollars to Crypto in One Bold Move","Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) is reportedly planning to raise $3 billion to invest in cryptocurrencies, predominantly Bitcoin. The firm is the parent company of the social media platform Truth Social. This decision has sent ripples through the finance and crypto worlds, with many seeing it as a step to show confidence in crypto growth. The investment will comprise $2 billion in equity and $1 billion in convertible bonds. This investment is poised to be announced at the Bitcoin 2025 event in Las Vegas. TMTG joins a growing list of public companies that are looking to diversify into digital assets. However, some see this as a conflict of interest given the latest stance on crypto by the Trump administration. A Strategic Shift into Crypto TMTG has initially indicated that it would be launching its own crypto services called Truth.Fi. This was to be a financial service and FinTech brand aimed at integrating digital assets and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) into its portfolio. The firm has already partnered with Crypto.com with an aim to develop ETFs that are focused on Bitcoin and other digital assets. The firm aims to be one of the serious contenders in the crypto economy. With the $3 billion rise in investments, the company will raise its capacity to acquire substantial crypto holdings. This follows the strategy of MicroStrategy, which has so far amassed over $62 billion in Bitcoin through various equity and debt issuances. Growing Interest in Cryptos The company is eyeing the potential growth in cryptos across several markets around the world. Bitcoin and other cryptos have seen a resurgence in interest, with merchants, top-rated crypto casino list options such as those on Casino.Guide, and casual users on the internet using them for their daily transactions. There has also been rising pro-crypto sentiment with the Trump administration. In fact, Vice President JD Vance and Donald Trump’s sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, are expected to speak at the Bitcoin 2025 event in Las Vegas, a move that will amplify its visibility. Other high-profile names like David Sacks, the administration’s unofficial ‘crypto czar,’ will be at the event. The firm will be looking to enhance its profile among the serious contenders in the crypto world. The Trump Administration is Crypto-friendly The Trump administration has been the catalyst for big cryptocurrency moves by companies across the country. The president was once a skeptic that called Bitcoin a scam. However, he changed his stance during his 2024 campaign and is promising to create a national cryptocurrency stockpile. The stance toward cryptocurrency has also changed. For example, he made an executive order to establish a crypto working group to enhance the growth of crypto in the country. Consequently, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has also been withdrawing investigations into major crypto firms, something that has fostered a conducive environment for investments. There is a growing list of corporations that are holding cryptocurrencies as treasury assets. Companies like Enlivex Therapeutics and Acurx Pharmaceuticals have recently allocated portions of their cash reserves to Bitcoin. Many are viewing it as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. Since the current landscape is filled with fiscal concerns and geopolitical risks, this playbook provides a shift from traditional assets. Risks and Controversies The company’s plans have attracted scrutiny from government ethics and regulatory authorities, particularly due to its ties to President Trump and his family. Additionally, TMTG’s aggressive push into crypto comes at a time when the industry remains vulnerable to hacks and volatility. In 2024, cryptocurrency platforms lost $2.2 billion to hacks . One of the decentralized finances (DeFi) platforms, Dough Finance, which was linked to TMTG, was susceptible. This firm collapsed after the hack, and there have been ongoing lawsuits alleging fraud. TMTG has also had a rather rough financial standing in the recent past. It reported a $19 million loss in the third quarter of 2024. This was driven by legal fees and costs tied to its streaming platform, Truth+ Streaming. The firm has a valuation of about $6 billion as of May 2025 but seeks to issue shares at market price, something that could dilute investor confidence. Effect on the Market Following the announcement, TMTG’s stock surged 4.64% to $25.72 following the news. Bitcoin itself saw a 1.5% gain, which is the largest growth in four days. This is a signal of the market optimism towards the firm’s entry into the space. The prospects of the crypto market growing are very real, with many predicting that it will remain bullish into the foreseeable future. However, there has not been regulatory clarity despite the positive posture by the government. When this is in place, we expect better returns on crypto investments.

2025-06-08T14:38:44,"Wynn expects CZ to win unless Hyperliquid ‘levels up’","In a post on X (formerly Twitter), James Wynn, the popular high-volume trader on the decentralized exchange Hyperliquid, publicly criticized the platform’s referral incentives and warned that its days could be numbered if it fails to evolve. His comments come amid rising anticipation for a new decentralized exchange (DEX) being developed by Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, one that promises to shield large traders from front-running and liquidation risks. Wynn wrote in his post that he hasn’t been paid a single cent by Hyperliquid. He stated, “I reached out on two occasions hoping to get some kind of partnership deal for all of the attention I was bringing them, and although they seemed thankful, they don’t offer such deals to anyone.” Though Wynn acknowledges Hyperliquid’s decentralized nature may explain its lack of traditional sponsorship structures, his frustration was clear. Despite generating high traffic and trading volume for the platform, Wynn claims to have made only $34,000 through referrals, an amount he describes as “extremely poor” given the scale of his influence. Wynn also criticized Hyperliquid’s referral program stating that the program sucks. He went on to state that other platforms have far better referral programs The liquidations that possibly sparked the outburst Wynn’s comments follow major and publicly chronicled liquidations on the Hyperliquid DEX. In one of the largest capitulations in late May, his massive long position, reportedly worth over $1.1 billion in Bitcoin, was liquidated to the tune of $100 million in full view of the market after Bitcoin fell below $105,000. The visibility of his open position raised suspicions that he may have been “hunted” by other traders who took advantage of the transparent order book, a controversial feature in decentralized finance. The incident sparked debate across crypto Twitter, leading to questions about the current DEX designs and how they expose large traders to manipulation. Wynn’s post seemed to echo the pain of that event and pointed squarely to what he sees as the solution: a new kind of DEX that keeps large trades private. CZ’s dark pool DEX enters the mix Wynn’s warning to Hyperliquid comes just as CZ, the founder of Binance, is preparing to launch a new “dark pool” Perpetuals DEX. According to CZ, this new platform will allow users to deposit assets on-chain but place orders privately, a model designed to prevent front-running, MEV (miner extractable value), and liquidation attacks. CZ stated in his post on X , “If you are looking to purchase $1 billion worth of tokens, you generally wouldn’t want others to notice your order until it’s completed.” While details remain scarce, the project is already being touted as a potential game-changer for DeFi. Wynn expects CZ to win unless Hyperliquid ‘levels up’ In his critique, Wynn clarified that he sees CZ’s entry into the DEX market as a serious threat to current players. “When CZ launches a dark pool perps DEX, it will put an end to HyperLiquid,” he warned. “CZ has the money, network, and teams to build something like no other. Look at what he’s done with Binance.” While this may seem like an endorsement of CZ’s new venture, it’s also a call to arms for Hyperliquid, a signal that the platform must improve not only its incentive structure but also its technical architecture if it wants to retain its user base. Wynn stated, “I hope this encourages HyperLiquid to level up… as they’ll soon be outweighed by better competition.” Hyperliquid has a strong lead in the perpetual DEX market. Source: Coinmarketcap For now, Hyperliquid remains the runaway leader in the perpetual DEX market, maintaining an almost upward-only trajectory since it launched. It holds a dominant 62% of the market share, with Aster as the closest competitor with about 27%. Hyperliquid also processed about $2.57B in the last 24 hours, more than double Aster’s $1.12B.

The deceptive pop-up message claimed the 73 year-old woman’s device was infected, including a fake Apple Care phone number for her to call, reports Columbus County News. When she dialed the number, scammers posing as Apple Care representatives said her computer and bank accounts were compromised. They then pretended to transfer her to Wells Fargo’s fraud department. Over several days, the criminals convinced the victim that fraudulent transactions were pending on her accounts.

After a staggering 355% rally from its April lows, the token has stalled, with on-chain data pointing to slowing user adoption and diminished whale interest. While the protocol’s fundamentals appear strong, technical indicators such as a bearish double-top pattern and weakening network activity suggest that SYRUP’s recent momentum may wane. At last check Sunday, Maple ( SYRUP ) price was trading at $0.40 — a few points below this month’s high of $0.4637. On-chain data shows that SYRUP’s network growth has plunged. It moved from 1,085 on May 9 to 37 today. This metric looks at the number of new accounts created each day. More data reveals that the daily active addresses have dropped from 285 on May 9 to 422. These numbers mean that the SYRUP token is not growing as it did in May, when it surged. SYRUP on-chain metrics | Source: Santiment Meanwhile, whales are also not buying the coin. Addresses holding between 10 million and 100 million SYRUP tokens now hold about 384 million, down from last week’s high of 395 million. Similarly, those holding between 1 million and 10 million tokens hold 228 million tokens, while those with between 100 million and 1 billion tokens have 458 million coins, down from 803 million in March.

2025-06-08T14:26:00,"The next crypto bull run: why MUTM could be the next coin to explode in 2025","Crypto has taken the world by storm over the past decade, proving to be a viable digital alternative to the legacy financial system. However, crypto has not yet achieved its full potential, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aims to change all that. Based on its current performance in the presale and other metrics, this project could explode in 2025. Let us take a closer look at this powerful project. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) – a project ready to explode Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been slowly building up momentum in 2025. So far, investors with a keen eye have already made a dive into the project and look forward to massive gains. For instance, it already has over 20k loyal followers across different social media channels. Additionally, its presale has been a massive success, raising over $10.1 million. Over 11,700 unique buyers are participating in this fast-paced presale, which is in phase 5. Phase 5 tokens are selling for $0.03, which is a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. In the upcoming phase 6, the token price will go up by 16.67%. That will reduce the guaranteed ROI based on the $0.06 listing price to 71.43% from the current 100%. It is one of the main reasons why the pace has been so fast in this phase of the presale. So far, over 25% of the tokens have been sold, barely a week after it began. Mutuum Finance giveaway spurs buying spree Mutuum Finance (MUTM) recently unveiled a $100,000 giveaway , which has boosted interest in the presale to dizzying heights. Participants in the presale have a chance to be one of the ten lucky winners who will receive a $10,000 reward in MUTM tokens. To take part in this exciting giveaway, all you need is a $50 investment in the ongoing presale. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) – the future of DeFi The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project is a decentralized non-custodial protocol that allows users to participate as borrowers, lenders, or liquidators. As a lender, you will deposit funds into one of the audited smart contracts on the protocol. You will then start earning interest on those assets, at a rate determined by the pool’s utilization rate. On top of receiving interest, depositors also receive mtTokens, which grant them instant liquidity. For instance, when you deposit $2,500 worth of ETH, you will receive mtETH tokens on a 1:1 ratio. These tokens can be redeemed at any time for the value of your assets, plus any interest accrued. The use of mtTokens simplifies the process for users, as they no longer have to claim or compound their assets manually; instead, they can monitor the value of their mtTokens rise on-chain and redeem them when they are ready. The mtTokens are based on the ERC20 token standard, which means holders can transfer these assets on compatible secondary exchanges. This will allow them to take advantage of new market opportunities in real time, even as their assets gain value in the liquidity pools. How Mutuum Finance maintains protocol solvency One of the main challenges of new DeFi projects is to attract enough liquidity. Mutuum Finance has come up with an elegant system of incentives that will keep liquidity streaming in. For instance, they will purchase MUTM tokens on the open market and distribute them to stakers participating in the safety module. The main impact of that will be to attract more stakers, which will help to increase liquidity on Mutuum Finance. Additionally, the purchases will boost the value of MUTM tokens, which will boost interest in the protocol, attracting even more liquidity. Mutuum Finance also plans to use the protocol’s profits to deepen the liquidity pool and for marketing purposes. All these actions will collectively help to grow the protocol and could make it one of the biggest protocols in terms of total value locked (TVL). Security on Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance recently passed a CertiK audit, which has been a major confidence boost for investors. All those previously on the sidelines are not taking every opportunity they get to exit other coins and join this budding project. With analysts predicting a 10x price increase in just the first few days, serious investors are leaving nothing to chance. You too can be part of this promising future by signing up for the ongoing MUTM token presale. At the current price of $0.03, it is an opportunity to grow your investment 10x or more by joining a project at the ground floor. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to experience the same feeling that early Bitcoin (BTC) had when they saw the price grow from $1 to over $100k today.

2025-06-08T14:09:01,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Holds Above $105,000 Despite Political Drama And Market Tension","Bitcoin (BTC) held firm above $105,000 as price action remained muted amid escalating political and market concerns. The flagship cryptocurrency had plunged to an intraday low of $100,421 late on Thursday before rebounding on Friday and reclaiming $105,000 on Saturday. BTC has been marginally up over the past 25 hours, trading around $105,695. Analysts are optimistic that the price will stabilize above $105,000 and push higher. Public Companies Turning To Bitcoin (BTC) As Bitcoin gains mainstream acceptance, many public companies are adding the asset to their treasuries. Companies like Strategy and Metaplanet have gone all-in on the flagship cryptocurrency, using it as a hedge against inflation, rising interest rates, and fiat debasement. However, critics have accused these companies of using Bitcoin as a speculative lifeline rather than a strategic asset. According to a report by BitBo, over 70 public companies hold Bitcoin as of June 6, with companies like Strategy and Metaplanet effectively acting as proxies for the asset. However, several companies are also strategically investing in the asset while continuing to focus on their primary business. Analyst and journalist Sean Williams has raised concerns about the potential failure of companies building Bitcoin treasuries, highlighting a lack of innovation and operational success as drivers of a potential collapse. The analyst also called the Bitcoin treasury hype a “dumpster fire in the making.” The analyst highlighted that many companies pivoting to Bitcoin were not profitable in the first place, suggesting their efforts were to make a quick profit from crypto volatility. He also highlighted several instances when the Bitcoin price saw substantial declines as a potential risk for the company. However, supporters believe corporate Bitcoin treasuries are grounded in strong macroeconomic reasons. Fidelity pointed out that companies are using Bitcoin treasuries as a successful hedge against inflation, fiscal deficits, and currency debasement. Bitcoin Liquidation Risk Rises Bitcoin (BTC) regained the $105,000 level over the weekend, recovering from Thursday’s sudden collapse that saw the price drop to a low of $100,421. The recent price action could inspire traders to bet on the price continuing its upward trajectory. An analysis from Rekt Capital stated, “On the Daily timeframe, Bitcoin is showcasing signs of breaking its two-week Downtrend (light blue) while also turning it into support earlier today. Daily Closing & retesting ~$106600 (black) would be even better to enable trend continuation.” Another analyst looked at order book liquidity to gauge price direction, summarizing that BTC’s liquidation cluster is signaling an upward move. “BTC liquidation cluster is now signaling an upside move. If BTC pumps 10% from here, $15.11 billion in shorts will get liquidated. Meanwhile, a 10% downside move will liquidate $9.58 billion in longs.” The analyst also predicted a move past $109,000-$110,000 for BTC next week. Other market watchers predicted a retest of the $100,000 support level, with popular trader CrypNeuvo stating, “100k is the strongest psychological support so, as explained on Sunday, it's the area where I'm building some longs with easy invalidation below it.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is painting an inverse cup and handle pattern, with its neckline near $100,500 acting as support. A breakdown below this level could trigger a drop to $91,000, aligning with BTC’s 200-day EMA. To regain control, Bitcoin bulls must ensure the price remains above $105,000. A breakdown of current levels could significantly impact BTC’s chances of hitting $150,000 by the end of the year. However, BTC’s weekly chart is flashing a warning, indicating the formation of a bearish divergence between the price and the RSI, a pattern last seen during the 2021 cycle top, when the RSI trended lower despite higher price highs. That divergence gave way to a 61% correction. Analysts believe a similar structure is visible, with a divergence below $112,000 on the weekly chart. BTC traded in the red most of last week, registering a marginal decline on Tuesday before falling 1.03% on Wednesday and settling at $107,834. Selling pressure intensified on Thursday as BTC fell over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,662. Sellers retained control on Friday as the price fell 1.51%, falling below $105,000 and settling at $104,067. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered over the weekend, rising 0.69% on Saturday and almost 1% on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,775. Source: TradingView The price fell to an intraday low of $103,734 on Monday as selling pressure intensified. However, it recovered from this level to register a marginal increase and move to $105,903. Bearish sentiment returned on Tuesday as BTC fell 0.44% to $105,435. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as the price fell below $105,000 and settled at $104,755. Selling pressure intensified on Thursday as BTC plunged 3%, falling to a low of $100,421 before ultimately settling at $101,615. The price recovered on Friday, rising almost 3% to recoup its losses and settle at $104,378. BTC continued pushing higher on Saturday, rising over 1% to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,575. The current session sees the price marginally up as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control. Buyers have pushed the price past $106,000 during the ongoing session.

2025-06-08T14:06:54,"K Wave Media: Ideally Positioned To Become The Metaplanet Of Korea Through Its Bitcoin Treasury Business Plan","Summary KWM seeks to become the “Metaplanet of Korea” through its recently announced $500 million equity raise to support a Bitcoin Treasury Facility. Its ability to leverage its position as an entertainment producer through crypto and NFT also makes it a ""GameStop of Korea"", in my opinion. The $500 million raise injects some much-needed working capital, while simultaneously lifting the stock price. This improves the risk profile of the stock going forward. Traders and risk-tolerant investors should consider KWM to be among the top tier of opportunities within the wave of small caps looking to crypto strategies to reinvigorate their stagnant stocks. K Wave Media Ltd. ( KWM ) is a recent de-SPAC that stumbled out of the gate since the business combination about a month ago. It became the first South Korean content media alliance to list on the NASDAQ with a controlling interest in six entertainment operating subsidiaries in the country. The stock got a significant shot in the arm when it announced a $500 million equity purchase facility to support a Bitcoin Treasury Facility. It aims to become the ""Metaplanet of Korea."" Metaplanet Inc. ( OTC:MTPLF ) is Japan's best performing and most liquid stock , up over 2,500% over the last 12 months. Not bad for a hotel management company. KWM rose 133% from $1.92 to $4.48 immediately following the news on Wednesday, but traded as high as $6.47 that day. A pullback since then can be seen as a buying opportunity for traders and risk-tolerant speculative investors who might have missed the initial run. What makes KWM stand out from other fly-by-night penny stocks looking to reinvigorate their dying stock prices by adopting Bitcoin treasury strategies is that KWM actually has an existing business it can leverage and amplify through the use of Bitcoin. In my opinion, this is not an attempt at a bandwagon jumping pump, but an actual workable business model. Data by YCharts KWM's business model is ideally positioned for a Bitcoin Treasury Facility While KWM wants to compare itself to Metaplanet, I think calling it a sort of ""GameStop of Korea"" is equally as apt. Two months ago, I wrote an article on GameStop ( GME ), defending the bull case of leveraging its popularity and cash balance into a crypto play. While GME is an entertainment retailer and KWM is a producer of entertainment content, the way they can integrate crypto into their brands and existing operations puts them a step ahead of other companies jumping on the bandwagon. Not only is KWM looking to create a buy and hold yield strategy like Metaplanet or Strategy Incorporated ( MSTR ), but it also intends to enable its customers to purchase content and K-pop merchandising utilizing Bitcoin in a Web3 environment. Investors could also invest in South Korean film and K-pop projects utilizing Bitcoin or other coins approved by the company. In my article on GME, I mentioned how the company created its own NFT marketplace, but shut it down last year. Presumably because it wasn't a success. The difference between GME and KWM is that KWM's subsidiaries are the owners and producers of the content, rather than merely being resellers. Crypto and NFTs are natural extensions of traditional sales channels for entertainment by the producers of said content, with built-in ways to prove authenticity and protect intellectual property. Examples include movie and concert ticket management and distribution of movies and music. Celebrity-backed memecoins are still attracting capital investment, which proves that artists can monetize their popularity, often on thin air. KWM has now opened itself to this world, with the difference being that its content creators can offer something of substance and value to their fans through their coins. This is simple fan club type of activities, but investors in North America may already be familiar with the massive and rabid fan bases of entertainers coming from South Korea. The ""BTS Army"" being one example of that. As big of a phenomenon ""stonk"" and ""apes"" have become in the retail end of Wall Street, with GME being the lead example, these movements pale in comparison to Korean pop star followings. In my opinion, KWM is on the right track trying to marry crypto and South Korean pop star trends, with a unique ability to monetize it all. But just like any other company out there, it has its own set of challenges. Operations, financials and risks KWM, through its holding subsidiary K Enter, own six operating subsidiaries: a Korean IP merchandising company that mostly sells K-pop items named Play Company, three movie production companies in LAMP, Bidangil, and Apeitda, Anseilen, a K drama production company and Solaire Partners, a Korean IP content-specialized private equity firm. On a pro forma basis, these subsidiaries generated a total of $59 million in revenue in 2024. Of that, Play generated $32 million, Bidangil $14 million and LAMP $12 million of revenue, respectively. That revenue generated $4 million in gross profit and an operating loss of $18 million. Total net loss - inclusive of $52 million in transaction costs - was $73 million. On a pro forma basis, KWM had $9 million in cash with a working capital deficit of $25 million at the end of 2024. Total equity was $116 million with $160 million of its assets being in the form of goodwill or intangibles. While the tangible net assets being negative should be a cause for concern, it would make sense that the bulk of a movie and entertainment producer's assets are in the form of intangibles. The operating loss combined with the working capital deficit implies an immediate need for financing. The 6-K filing related to the $500 million equity purchase facility states that in addition to using the proceeds to support the Bitcoin-centric digital asset treasury strategy, the company will also be using it for working capital and M&A activities, further expanding its content and K-pop related businesses. The company was smart to turn the need to raise significant funds to support its business and related downward pressure on a stock in this type of situation into a bullish catalyst backed by Bitcoin mania. One of the prime motivating factors of KWM consolidating these businesses and going public in the first place was to boost its capital and bargaining power against global over-the-top media platforms such as Netflix ( NFLX ). Taking a look at KWM's thin gross margins and investors can understand why this would be a goal. Netflix shouldn't make more money on Korean productions than the content creators themselves. Starting a Bitcoin strategy is a great way to increase KWM's market visibility and leverage it into improved financial performance of its primary business. The major risk of the Bitcoin treasury announcement outside of negative price action on Bitcoin is that we have no details on the terms of the $500 million financing. It'll be impossible to assess the potential from a fundamental perspective until we know the valuation of the raise. KWM trades at a little over $200 million market cap, so this financing is going to substantially dilute the stock. Investors who are interested in this opportunity are going to have to accept the risk of being unable to properly value the upside of this Bitcoin strategy until more information is provided. Conclusion: Speculative Strong Buy To call KWM a speculative strong buy is a bit of a misnomer. ""Speculative"" buy in my world usually implies there are a lot of risks to the thesis and therefore should be considered a weaker buy than normal. In contrast, a ""strong"" buy refers to a stock with a very favorable risk to reward profile, likely with a high floor with a thesis that is based primarily on fundamentals. I view KWM as an exception to this rule. The Bitcoin Treasury model is in the early stages and there are too many unknowns from a fundamental and operating perspective to not consider this situation speculative in nature. However, I think the upside if execution is done well is so obscenely high that a simple ""buy"" recommendation doesn't sufficiently explain my bullishness. I have purchased shares in hopes of a very strong return as this story unfolds.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4793287-k-wave-media-metaplanet-of-korea-through-bitcoin-treasury-business-plan?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING","MTPLF|GME|MSTR|KWMWW|KWM",cryptocompare

2025-06-08T14:00:25,"Unstaked Ignites Massive Buying Frenzy as Presale Reaches $9.2M! Meanwhile, PI Coin Falters and DOGE Trend Explodes","The crypto space is buzzing again, and three names are pulling in all the attention: Dogecoin, Pi Network, and Unstaked. In a week of wild moves, Unstaked has surged past $9.2 million raised in presale and is rapidly approaching the $10 million line. With its unique AI-backed DeFi model, a $1 million rewards campaign, and increasing demand, Unstaked is gaining recognition as the best long term crypto you don’t want to miss in 2025. At the same time, Dogecoin (DOGE) is flirting with a breakout pattern that’s capturing traders’ imaginations, while Pi (PI) continues to spiral down, raising alarms among holders and analysts alike. Dogecoin Trend Sparks Buzz as Bullish Pattern Sets the Stage Dogecoin (DOGE) is back on the radar, and this time, momentum might be real. The coin is hovering near $0.2245, but technical traders are watching closely. A bullish inverse head and shoulders pattern is forming on the 1-hour chart, and with a neckline around $0.228, a confirmed breakout could send DOGE racing to $0.239 or even $0.25. Adding fuel to the fire? On-chain data shows that nearly 78% of DOGE holders are in profit, ranking it just behind Bitcoin, XRP, and Chainlink. While that does raise short-term sell-off concerns, it also reflects a strong price foundation and long-term interest. Traders are watching volume closely. If DOGE gets the right push, the current Dogecoin trend analysis could signal a broader meme coin rally, and nobody wants to be left behind when that rocket launches. Pi Crash Alert Deepens as Sentiment Cracks and Price Dips Meanwhile, Pi Coin (PI) is sounding serious alarm bells. After slipping to around $0.67892, the fear of a crash is growing louder. Analysts now warn that the price could tumble all the way to $0.40 if key issues like transparency and developer communication remain unresolved. Bearish technicals are stacking up. The MACD shows a downward crossover, Bollinger Bands are squeezing tight, and volume is drying up. The Pi (PI) crash alert has turned into a major point of concern among holders, many of whom are split between calling the dip a buying opportunity and raising red flags over centralization concerns. The Fear & Greed Index has plunged to zero, signaling peak caution. Without a major announcement or development roadmap from the Pi Core Team, the risk of deeper declines continues to grow. For many, the time to look elsewhere is now, and Unstaked is catching their attention. Unstaked’s $9.2M Presale Surge Signals It’s the Best Long Term Crypto to Grab While PI struggles and DOGE teases a breakout, Unstaked is stealing the show. Already past $9.2 million in stage 19 of its presale, with tokens priced at $0.011065, the project is lighting up every serious crypto radar. Its rise isn’t driven by luck, it’s the result of strong fundamentals, powerful tech, and a clear roadmap that puts community and innovation first. The platform runs on its unique Proof of Intelligence model, where users are rewarded based on real, AI-verified contributions, not just passive holding. It’s a system that values action and quality, rewarding real participation and creating long-term sustainability. Unstaked also prioritizes transparency. No private allocations, a fully open smart contract, and live public presale tracking are in place to foster trust. Add in decentralized governance that puts control in the hands of token holders, and you’ve got one of the most attractive offerings in the DeFi space. The FOMO doesn’t stop there. The $1,000,000 Unstaked competition is turning heads. Over five months, 20 winners will each claim $50,000 in $UNSD tokens. To qualify? Complete a few easy tasks, refer friends, share posts, and make a $100 minimum token purchase. It’s a win-win: participants get rewarded, and the community keeps expanding. With utility, transparency, governance, and real traction, Unstaked is being talked about not just as another presale, but as the best long term crypto with real staying power. Unstaked’s Climb Proves the Future Is Being Built Now As crypto markets zigzag through bullish setups and sudden selloffs, one thing is clear: not every project is built to last. Pi Coin’s crash alert highlights the risks of stagnation, while DOGE’s exciting technicals could mean a rally is near, but only Unstaked is proving it can lead with real momentum and substance. With more than $9.2 million already secured, and its AI-powered, community-driven infrastructure catching fire, Unstaked is charging ahead while others hesitate. The presale is gaining pace, the ecosystem is expanding, and the opportunity window may not stay open for long. If you’re searching for the best long term crypto with vision, growth, and early access potential, Unstaked is the name to remember. Don’t let this one pass you by.

Bitcoin Ready For Breakout As Traders Eye $114K And $83K Levels In an X post on June 7, Glassnode provides an insight on potential Bitcoin price action using the Short-Term Holder (STH) cost basis model, derived from the Work of Cost (WOC) price framework. As the name implies, the STH cost basis represents the average purchased price of all coins belonging to short-term holders i.e. investors who acquired their Bitcoin within the last 155 days. The STH cost basis is an important market metric as it reflects the risk appetite of newer market participants who are typically the most reactive to price change. It is also a strong indicator of market sentiment with an ability to act as resistance or support depending on the price direction. According to the data by Glassnode, the current Bitcoin STH cost basis is estimated at $97,100. Using standard deviation bands in this WOC model, Glassnode has further identified the $114,800 price level as the +1STD level of this cost basis and a potentially heated market zone. Considering Bitcoin’s price, this $114,800 price zone represents the next major resistance, a break above which is expected to trigger a massive buying pressure and push the premier cryptocurrency further into uncharted price territory. Glassnode’s WOC model also identifies the -1STD level at $83,200 to represent a critical support zone in the present bullish structure. A decisive price fall below this level would signal market weakness and is likely to cause a cascade of liquidations and further price corrections. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says This Bitcoin Top Signal Hasn’t Gone Off Yet — What To Know Bitcoin Price Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $105,745 reflecting a 1.07% gain in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, the asset’s daily trading volume is down by 34.27% and valued at $38.66 billion. Provided Bitcoin continues to consolidate above the STH cost basis at $97,100, there is a valid chance for a market bullish push towards resistance at $114,800. However, a loss of the critical support at $97,100 would points to a retest at $83,200 which holds strong potential bearish consequences.

Pseudonymous analyst Pentoshi tells his 866,100 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows that BTC demand is significantly outpacing supply, resulting to higher prices. The trader says he seeing “insatiable” demand for Bitcoin from firms in the traditional finance (TradFi) world, leading him to believe that bullish continuation is on the table for BTC. “Demand > supply A picture is worth 1,000 words Feel like we see around $120,000 this month.” Source: Pentoshi/X The analyst also tells his followers to remain patient and have a long-term outlook on the crypto king. “Everyday: ‘If there’s billions of dollars flowing into BTC, why is it not going up?’ My brother in Christ, Zoom out. It’s going to get there, just maybe not always at the speed you want.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $105,536. Looking at the broader crypto market, Pentoshi says a new bubble is forming in the space. “Looks like all the money is going to be made in crypto companies doing IPOs (initial public offering) at wild valuations Deeper pockets, more liquidity, higher valuations Another bubble is brewing, another bubble to chase.” Pentoshi’s bubble call comes after shares of the stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) meteorically rose on the first day of trading. Circle debuted on the stock market on Thursday with an opening price of $69 per share, a massive increase from the IPO value of $31.00 per share. As of Friday’s close, CRCL is worth $107.70.

This bullish outlook comes as SOL recovers from a dip on June 6, when it touched the weekly low of $141. As of press time, the token was trading at $149.52, down 1.5% over the past 24 hours. SOL one-week price chart. Source: Finbold Solana is facing short-term bearish pressure, with the price lingering below the 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $161 and the 200-day SMA at $164.19. A decisive break above the 200-day SMA could confirm a trend reversal and ignite renewed bullish momentum. The 14-day relative strength index ( RSI ) is 40.14, indicating mild bearish pressure without entering oversold territory. SOL’s path to $620 From a technical standpoint, analyst Master Ananda shared a TradingView post on June 6 outlining a potential path for SOL to reach $620, with a minimum target of $420 and an extended high of $1,020. After a roughly 24% correction from $188 to $141, Ananda believes the pullback phase may be over. In this case, the cryptocurrency is developing a higher low pattern, which suggests the start of a new upward trend. SOL price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Meanwhile, key Fibonacci extension levels support this projection: $420 at the 1.618 level, $620 at the 2.618 level, and $1,021 at the 4.618 level. According to the forecast, the digital asset could hit the $620 mark by January 2026, a 316% increase from its current price. If this target is reached, Solana’s market cap could balloon to approximately $325 billion, potentially ranking it second behind Bitcoin ( BTC ), assuming minimal growth from Ethereum ( ETH ) during the same period. Finally, the trading expert cautioned against shorting during a bullish trend, advising instead to wait for support levels before entering long positions. Solana fundamentals Meanwhile, Solana’s broader ecosystem continues to show notable momentum. Market attention is focused on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) decision regarding spot SOL exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) applications. The odds of approval in 2025 have surged to over 80% despite the SEC delaying its decision on proposals from 21Shares, Bitwise, VanEck, and Canary Capital. On the flip side, some skepticism remains. Banking giant Standard Chartered questioned Solana’s long-term sustainability in late May, warning in a report that the network risks becoming a “one-trick pony” dominated by memecoin creation and trading. For starters, Solana’s recent momentum was driven mainly by meme coin activity on the network.

The suit focuses on Capital One Shopping, a free browser extension designed to search for online coupons, better prices and rewards at over 100,000 online retailers. But the plaintiffs say Capital One stole from bloggers, influencers, and YouTubers by overriding their tracking codes and diverting affiliate marketing commissions from creators during the checkout process. They accuse Capital One of unjust enrichment, interfering with their contracts, and violating the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Judge Trenga ruled that plaintiffs Jesika Brodiski and Peter Hayward plausibly argued that Capital One should have known that it was diverting payments by overriding web cookies containing data on commissions. Capital One denies the allegations. “Capital One Shopping does not replace affiliate marketer cookies or unlawfully take credit for commissions. We disagree with the allegations in the complaint and look forward to defending ourselves in court.” Capital One was also recently accused of misleading clients by not telling them about higher-yielding 360 Performance Savings accounts, allegedly preventing customers from accessing better interest rates, keeping their 360 Savings account rates as low as 0.3%.

The idea, first sparked by crypto trader Vladcoin, is now being seen as a real possibility by Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas. He believes there’s a strong chance we could see this unique fund by 2026. ETF Analyst Sees a Real Chance In response to Vladcoin’s idea of having an ETF that buys and sells meme coins based on how well they perform, buying the promising ones and selling off the weaker ones. Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said there’s a “really good chance” that an actively managed meme coin ETF could exist in the future. However, he added that it would probably take some time to happen. Really good chance this exists at some point. First we’ll get slew of active crypto ETFs (eta Winter 2025). Active meme coin-only likely 2026 tho. The return dispersion (and lack of sell side coverage) ripe for active. Could produce next star manager. Who knows. https://t.co/9CcEc4xmev — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) June 7, 2025 He expects to see many active crypto ETFs launch by winter 2025, but a meme coin-only active ETF is more likely to come around 2026. Meanwhile, polygon-based prediction market Polymarket predicts that Dogecoin ETF will see approval by the end of 2025 with a probability of 44% . No Meme Coin ETFs Yet While we don’t have a meme coin-only ETF yet, the idea isn’t completely out of the blue. Several big asset managers have already launched or filed for spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, including BlackRock, Fidelity, and VanEck. These funds have been very popular, bringing in billions of dollars in assets within months. Some smaller players have also filed for “crypto basket” ETFs that invest in a mix of digital assets, but so far, no one has filed for a meme coin-only ETF. Still, the idea is gaining interest. Why Meme Coins? Eric believes that meme coins could be perfect for active management. Meme coins like Dogecoin , Shiba Inu, and Pepe are known for their huge price swings and hype-driven moves. Many don’t have traditional research or clear fundamentals, which makes it hard to know which ones will survive. Eric also hinted that if this kind of ETF comes to life, it could create a new star in the investing world.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/meme-coin-etfs-to-be-launched-by-2026-says-senior-bloomberg-analyst/,"BTC|DOGE|ETH|SHIB|TRADING","News",cryptocompare

Bitcoin ( BTC ) was trading at $105,550 on Sunday, June 8, up by 5% from its lowest point last week. It remains 5.75% below its highest point this year. Bitcoin has wavered recently because of investor profit-taking . In May, its price surged to a record high of $111,900, a 50% surge from the lowest level in April. BTC also wavered as data pointed to outflows from exchange-traded funds. SoSoValue data shows that these ETFs shed $128 million last week after shedding $157 million a week earlier. It was the first back-to-back weekly outflows since April. Further data shows that sentiment among crypto investors has turned neutral this month. The closely-watched fear and greed index has dropped to the neutral point of 56. Bitcoin has also wavered after reports emerged that China was considering selling its seized coins. Data shows that it holds 190,000 coins worth over $20 billion.

The daily chart shows that it has slowly formed a cup-and-handle pattern and is completing the handle section. Bitcoin has also remained above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, which provide substantial support. It has also remained above the major S/R pivot point of the Murrey Math Lines tool. Therefore, the coin will likely bounce back in the coming weeks. The initial target is the cup’s upper side at $109,477. After moving above the all-time high of $111,900, it may surge to $150,000.

Zimbabwe residents lose funds to bogus investment platform According to reports, the platform has other types of advertisements spread across Facebook , targeting unsuspecting residents of the country. “Other platforms may falter, but we remain the best place for safe and secure coins trading in Zimbabwe. Trade on InnBucks investment today!” another post read. However, it was discovered that the platform had no connections to InnBucks, with the platform releasing a post on its Facebook page warning its users. “Stay vigilant, stay safe. Never share your InnBucks PIN, OTP, or ID number with anyone. InnBucks does not carry out Investment schemes, always verify the authenticity of pages through our official channels—call us on 569 or message us on our official social media platforms. Be on the lookout for fake pages and scammers like the ones below,” InnBucks posted, attaching some of the fake platform’s posts. According to investigations carried out by Bulawayo24 , the fake trading platform’s posts have a WhatsApp number attached, with the number belonging to an agent called Michelle Chiunda, claiming she is from InnBucks Investment on Facebook. The attached number only connects through WhatsApp and a call is always received by a party that is oblivious to either the trading investment platform or its WhatsApp account. Upon enquiry, “Chiunda” mentioned that the WhatsApp number was registered in her sister’s name, claiming the name, Katanda, which was attached to the number, is also her surname. Meanwhile, upon calling the number, it was answered by a woman who seemed unaware that her number was being used to lure people into InnBucks Investment on Facebook, pointing to the fact that the number might have been hacked. Fake investment officer reveals operations Confirming the advertisement made on Facebook, Chiunda mentioned that if a client in Zimbabwe invests $100 on the platform, the company will take charge of the trading on their behalf using their auto-electronic mining machine. This machine is 100% guaranteed for locking all incoming profit, it also keeps the trade signal stable to prevent any negative effect from MARKET-CAP,” she said. She added that the trade takes 24 hours to complete, and once it is done, the user is guaranteed X10 of their investment, while the company keeps the remaining X3 part of the profit. Chiunda said that users in Zimbabwe can receive their profit from any account, highlighting that they pay to Ecocash, Innbucks, or Mukuru. She mentioned that as soon as a user signifies their intention to invest, a link is sent to them where they can register. For a user in Zimbabwe to register on the trading platform, they must send their details to Chiunda to help them register or click on the amexcypmarket link that she sends to them. After registration, the user is expected to send a screenshot of the interface to her before they proceed with their initial investment starting from $50. She also claimed that the platform is in association with InnBucks, a party that has already distanced itself from the scam, and indicated that the authorities have been alerted.
