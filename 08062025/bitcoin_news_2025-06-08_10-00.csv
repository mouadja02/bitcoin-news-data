2025-06-08T07:55:11,"Coinbase, BiT Global Settle Legal Fight Over wBTC Delisting","Key Takeaways: Coinbase and BiT Global settled their wBTC delisting dispute, closing the lawsuit with prejudice. The suit had sought over $1 billion in damages, claiming the delisting favored Coinbase’s cbBTC token. Coinbase reported mixed Q1 earnings, with revenue up but net income down 94%. Coinbase and BiT Global have reached a settlement in their legal dispute over the delisting of BiT Global’s wrapped bitcoin (wBTC) token from the exchange. According to a joint court filing , BiT Global has agreed to dismiss its lawsuit against Coinbase with prejudice, preventing future legal action on the matter. Both parties will cover their own legal costs. Details of any further settlement terms were not disclosed. BiT Global Sued Coinbase Over wBTC Delisting in California Court BiT Global filed the suit last year in the Northern District of California, after Coinbase removed wBTC from its platform. The exchange cited “unacceptable risk” that the token could be controlled by Chinese-born crypto billionaire Justin Sun, who became affiliated with wBTC through a partnership in August 2023. Coinbase raised concerns after Sun’s involvement, questioning BiT Global about his role in the token’s operations. Meanwhile, Sun-backed World Liberty Financial switched its cbBTC holdings in favor of wBTC following his appointment as an advisor. BiT Global argued the delisting was unjustified and damaged both liquidity and market confidence in wBTC, while allegedly giving an edge to Coinbase’s rival product, cbBTC, launched two months prior to the delisting. Coinbase and BiT Global have settled their dispute over the delisting of wBTC, with BiT Global dismissing its lawsuit filed in the Northern District of California. Both parties will cover their own legal fees. BiT Global had alleged that Coinbase unjustifiably delisted wBTC,… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) June 7, 2025 BiT Global has been a joint custodian of wBTC’s Bitcoin reserves, alongside crypto firm BitGo, since August 2024. The lawsuit sought more than $1 billion in damages and requested injunctive relief to prevent further harm. However, with the dismissal finalized, the legal chapter between the two firms is now closed. Coinbase Q1 Revenue Climbs, But Profit Falls 94% Coinbase reported mixed first-quarter results , with revenue rising 24% year-over-year to $2 billion, but falling short of analyst expectations and down 10% from the previous quarter. While transaction revenue grew to $1.26 billion, its subscription and services division—covering staking and custodial offerings, rose 37% to nearly $700 million, reflecting growing diversification beyond trading. Despite the revenue uptick, net income plunged 94% to $66 million as the company marked down its crypto holdings amid market volatility. Adjusted earnings stood at $526.6 million, or $1.94 per share, still below last year’s figure of $2.53. Operating expenses surged 51% to $1.3 billion due to aggressive marketing and asset write-downs. Coinbase’s earnings were weighed down by unpredictable macroeconomic conditions and fluctuations in digital asset prices. However, the company noted its second-highest ever monthly user count, with CFO Alesia Haas highlighting increased engagement across non-trading services.

2025-06-08T07:44:08,"Bitcoin core devs’ statement sparks argument in the community","A joint statement from Bitcoin core developers has sparked arguments among the members of the community. According to the core devs, they want a hands-off approach to how the Bitcoin network is used, a proposal that has not gone down well with everyone in the community. The proposal is coming amid the ongoing controversy concerning non-monetary use cases. “This is not endorsing or condoning non-financial data usage, but accepting that as a censorship-resistant system, Bitcoin can and will be used for use cases not everyone agrees on,” the statement published on the Bitcoin Core website said. In the letter, the developers argued that the Bitcoin network is defined by its users, who are free to choose what software they use and implement the policies they want. The post also highlighted that its core contributors are not in a position to mandate what software or policies they desire. This statement comes amid the ongoing debate over spam inscriptions on the Bitcoin network. “Being free to run any software is the network’s primary safeguard against coercion,” the developers added. Bitcoin community divided after developers’ statement The statement seemed to have gone down well with many Bitcoiners, and like with every update, some people were against it. One of its critics was JAN3 CEO Samson Mow , who had issues with the tone of the letter. “Bitcoin Core devs have been changing the network gradually to enable spam and now seem focused on also removing barriers for spammers. It’s disingenuous to just say “It is what it is now, too bad.” This statement itself is also inappropriate. Feels like an NYA from Core devs,” he said. A statement on Bitcoin Core development and transaction relay policy – https://t.co/K4AaPPqTSD — Bitcoin Core Project (@bitcoincoreorg) June 7, 2025 Mow’s statement comes after a May 8 update in which the core developers decided to remove a long-standing limit on transaction data in a network upgrade to allow for larger data segments. “Bitcoin Core’s next release will, by default, relay and mine transactions whose OP_RETURN outputs exceed 80 bytes and allow any number of these outputs,” the announcement read on GitHub. Like with this update, some Bitcoiners still saw an opening to non-financial use cases. Meanwhile, Casa founder Jameson Lopp defended the letter. Lopp mentioned that the core developers are saying that they don’t want to force anyone to run a code they don’t want, highlighting what they think about relay policy and network health. “When there was no cohesive message, and it was just a bunch of independent developers making individual statements, Bitcoin Core was accused of having “poor public relations,” Lopp said. He also added that now that the group has published a joint statement, people are finding a reason to be offended about it. Developers make their case in the joint letter According to the developers, it is better for the BTC node software “to aim to have a realistic idea of what will end up in the next block, rather than attempting to intervene between consenting transaction creators and miners to discourage activity that is largely harmless at a technical level.” They also added that while this view is not shared by all users and developers, they believe that it is in the best interest of Bitcoin and its users, hoping that they agree with their statement. The developers mentioned that the main goals of transaction relay are predicting what Bitcoin transactions will be mined, speeding up block propagation” for the transactions expected to be mined, and helping BTC miners learn about fee-paying transactions. Meanwhile, Bitcoiner Carl Honton has criticized the bill saying, “It’s Bit “Coin” not Bit “Bucket” or Bit “Store” or whatever general purpose data store you have in mind. It’s a “peer-to-peer electronic cash system.” Bitcoin core developer Luke Dashjr also criticized what the group aimed to achieve with the relay policy outlined in the statement. “The goals of transaction relay listed are basically all wrong,” Dashjr said. He added that predicting what will be mined is a centralizing goal. Expecting spam to be mined is defeatism. Helping spam propagate is harmful. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-06-08T07:41:58,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Golden Cross Pattern Targets $150,000 Rally","Bitcoin is once again flashing a historically bullish signal, a golden cross, as traders eye the $150,000 mark. Currently trading at $105,597 with a daily volume of over $35 billion, BTC has pulled back slightly after its latest golden cross. This setup occurs when the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day average, typically viewed as the start of a long-term uptrend. Chain Mind, a widely followed crypto analyst, notes that this pullback isn’t unusual. In fact, it mirrors what happened in late 2024. Back then, Bitcoin dropped 10% right after the golden cross , only to surge over 60% in the following two months. The recent 8% decline post-cross appears to be following the same script. 3/➫ Back in Q4 2024, $BTC dropped 10% right after the golden cross ❍ Then it reversed hard and rallied over 60% in two months ❍ That pattern is repeating now – $BTC has already dropped 8% post-cross ❍ The similarities are striking — 𝗖𝗛𝗔𝗜𝗡 𝗠𝗜𝗡𝗗 (@0xChainMind) June 5, 2025 He emphasizes patience. While many expect immediate gains from a golden cross, history suggests the pattern often begins with a dip before a broader rally unfolds. According to Chain Mind, the setup remains intact, and the $150,000 target by year-end remains realistic. Bitcoin Holds Key Support Zone What reinforces the bullish bias is Bitcoin’s ability to stay well above its 200-day moving average, which now sits near $94,700. This level acts as critical long-term support. As long as BTC holds above it, the Bitcoin price prediction remains bullish. Bitcoin Price Chart Source: Tradingview Chain Mind also highlights a rise in Bitcoin dominance, which has hit a three-year high. Investors are rotating capital out of altcoins and back into Bitcoin, viewing it as a safer store of value amid broader market uncertainty. Consider these signs of strength: Bitcoin’s dominance is rising, while altcoins are losing ground. Ethereum (ETH) is struggling to hold above $2,500. Altcoins like SOL and ADA have broken key support levels. Long-term holders continue to sit on their BTC instead of selling. This points to sustained institutional interest. Firms like Metaplanet and Strategy have been buying large amounts of Bitcoin, while spot ETFs continue to see inflows, despite price volatility. Institutions Favor Bitcoin, Not Altcoins One of the clearest signs that Bitcoin remains in favor is the behavior of large investors, also known as “whales.” On-chain data shows a significant portion of Bitcoin supply hasn’t moved in months, reinforcing the idea that long-term holders aren’t shaken. Altcoins, on the other hand, are under pressure. Many are not just lagging BTC, they’re also falling against the U.S. dollar. Chain Mind points out that until sentiment improves and key percentages, such as ETH/BTC or SOL/BTC, begin trending higher, Bitcoin will continue to dominate. To sum it up: The golden cross pattern is historically bullish, even in the face of short-term dips. BTC holding above $94,700 supports the uptrend. Rising dominance and institutional inflows point to a potential surge. For traders and investors alike, this is a classic case of “zooming out.” The short-term noise may rattle nerves, but structurally, the setup for a powerful Bitcoin rally toward $150,000 appears intact.

2025-06-08T07:35:10,"BITQ: Exposure To Bitcoin With An Added Layer Of Risk","Summary BITQ offers exposure to bitcoin-related equities, but introduces additional operational and business risks compared to direct bitcoin investment. The ETF is highly concentrated, with top holdings like MicroStrategy and Coinbase heavily influencing performance and adding company-specific risk. BITQ is volatile, directionally correlates with bitcoin, and has a higher expense ratio than direct bitcoin ETFs, making it less attractive for pure bitcoin exposure. Given these factors, I recommend a HOLD rating on BITQ, suggesting investors consider direct bitcoin funds for simpler, lower-risk exposure. Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF ( BITQ ) is an equity ETF designed to provide investors with exposure to the equity of companies involved in bitcoin. Before investing in this strategy, one must be aware of the additional layer of risks involved in holding a portfolio of companies involved in the bitcoin market. If one is seeking direct exposure to bitcoin, it may be worth considering one of the bitcoin funds as opposed to an equity strategy. BITQ holds roughly 30 individual equities of companies that span from bitcoin miners to banks and asset managers. Overall, the basis for the strategy is to hold a portfolio of ""picks and shovels"" companies building out the core infrastructure for bitcoin, including miners and brokerages. Interestingly enough, Strategy ( MSTR ), formerly known as MicroStrategy, is the portfolio's top holding despite having minimal involvement in the development of the bitcoin ecosystem. Nonetheless, Strategy is a large holder of bitcoin through a leveraged debt & equity issuance strategy for acquiring bitcoin. The target balance for the strategy is to allocate a minimum of 80% of the portfolio to Tier 1 crypto innovator companies whose primary focus is in the crypto market with the remaining 20% in Tier 2, large-cap companies with diversified business interests that include ""one significant public business line focused on the crypto market."" Accordingly, for a company to be classified as a Tier 1 company, 75% of their revenue must derive from servicing cryptocurrency markets. This includes crypto mining firms, crypto mining equipment suppliers, crypto financial services companies, and other financial institutions servicing primarily crypto-related clientele. Companies can also be classified as Tier 1 organizations if 75% of net assets are direct holdings of bitcoin, Ethereum, or other related cryptocurrencies, resulting in Strategy being classified as a Tier 1 Crypto Innovator. Corporate Reports With BITQ holding 30 companies, company concentration will be greater than when compared to larger, more diverse portfolio strategies. Accordingly, the top 10 holdings account for 60.35% of the total portfolio weight. This may mean that the direction of the portfolio strategy can be determined primarily by the top 10 holdings, which include bitcoin miners and a brokerage platform. Corporate Reports Strategy is by far the most heavily weighted company in the strategy, accounting for 11.97% of the portfolio. Though my most recent research covering MSTR is quite dated , I believe the overview can be helpful in assessing the company. MSTR has a unique investment proposition in which the organization issues debt and equity to buy bitcoin in a flywheel fashion. The organization sells this strategy as a leveraged bitcoin fund. The other side of the business consists of legacy operations relating to its business intelligence platform, which many investors in MSTR downplay as the organization transforms into a bitcoin strategy. Given the weight of MSTR in the portfolio, I recommend potential investors research this company prior to making an investment decision in BITQ. The second-largest holding in BITQ is Coinbase Global ( COIN ), a cryptocurrency brokerage platform, at 9.45% of the portfolio weighting. Many of the names following are mining organizations, with MARA Holdings ( MARA ) being by far the largest miner in the cohort. Though my research covering MARA is also dated, I believe understanding the company's structure can help investors determine whether BITQ is an appropriate investment strategy. In short, MARA is a cryptocurrency mining company that began diversifying its business strategy last year into data center infrastructure, including submerged server cooling units. Though the mining industry is power-intensive, the strategy has shifted in the last few years from strictly mining to offloading heat generated from the servers as a form of energy production. Overall, the industry is relatively volatile, with profitability remaining relatively challenged. Given the volatile nature of bitcoin and reporting requirements, financial analysis of the industry can be relatively challenging and may not appropriately represent the industry. FinChat Additionally, given the volatility of bitcoin, fund performance can drastically vary from period to period, showing large gains or losses at any given time. Corporate Reports Year-to-date, BITQ has outperformed the S&P 500 ( SPX ) despite the drastically larger drawdown. TradingView As a result of the volatility in the bitcoin and related market, this strategy may be best suited for active traders or those willing to undertake major short-term risks. In general, BITQ is directionally correlated with the underlying bitcoin market. Under this notion, investing in BITQ may add an additional layer of operational risk when compared to a direct investment in bitcoin. Given that the equities in the portfolio are businesses and not a commodity, one must consider the business operations in addition to bitcoin performance as an associated risk. This may also include industry risk, political risk, and financial performance. TradingView BITQ has an expense ratio of 80bps, making BITQ relatively more expensive than comparable strategies. Given the relative correlation between related equity ETFs and bitcoin ETFs, it may be worth considering investing in bitcoin ETFs given the relative performance, lower fees, and comparable performance. Seeking Alpha My recommendation is to take into consideration the broader risk profile of the portfolio companies that make up BITQ. If seeking bitcoin exposure, it may be wise to consider one of the bitcoin funds over the equity ETFs, as many of the business-related risks aren't prevalent. I am recommending BITQ with a HOLD rating.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4793231-bitq-exposure-to-bitcoin-with-an-added-layer-of-risk?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|RESEARCH","BITQ",cryptocompare
2025-06-08T07:31:03,"Ripple Price Analysis: Increased Bearish Momentum as XRP Fails to Break Out","After a long consolidation phase, XRP continues to underperform compared to many other altcoins despite ongoing speculation around regulatory clarity. Recent price action shows increasing bearish momentum. Buyers have failed to hold critical levels on both the USDT and BTC pairs, suggesting a cautious outlook for the short term. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The USDT Pair XRP/USDT is now trading around $2.2 after getting rejected from the higher boundary of the large descending channel. The price has also lost the 100-day MA (orange) and is testing the 200-day MA (blue), both located around the $2.30 mark. The RSI also sits near 44, reflecting weak bullish momentum and a lack of buying interest. A daily close below the psychological level at $2 would likely open the door for a deeper correction toward the $1.55 demand zone, which also aligns with the lower trendline of the channel. Until the buyers reclaim the moving averages with strong volume, the trend favours the sellers. Structurally, the market remains neutral to bearish, with a potential shift toward bearish if the current consolidation fails to reverse. Investors should watch for a reaction around the $1.90–$2 area, which will likely dictate the next directional impulse. The BTC Pair The XRP/BTC pair is trading around the 2,100 SAT mark after a prolonged grind lower within a descending wedge structure. Once again, the price has lost both the 100-day and 200-day MAs, which have also created a bearish crossover around the 2,500 SAT mark, and is now hovering above the lower channel boundary and the 2,000 SAT demand zone. There is also a notable FVG (Fair Value Gap) in the 1,600 – 1,900 SAT range, which may act as a magnet and a support zone in case the 2,000 SAT level breaks down. Buyers will need to reclaim the moving averages and break above the channel’s higher trendline around the 2,500–2,700 SAT zone to regain any strength, which currently seems unlikely unless Bitcoin itself consolidates. As long as the price remains within the channel, short-term relief bounces are possible, but momentum still favours sellers. The broader implication is continued BTC strength or XRP relative weakness in the market cycle.

The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Bitcoin’s Journey: Is the Original Cryptocurrency Still King? Bitcoin, created by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, is the first cryptocurrency. It operates without a central authority, allowing people to send money directly to each other. Instead of physical coins, Bitcoin uses a shared ledger called blockchain. This ledger is spread across many computers, so no single entity controls it. Transactions are verified by miners, who solve complex puzzles to add new records and are rewarded with bitcoins. This process keeps the system secure and prevents fraud. In today’s market, Bitcoin remains a major player among cryptocurrencies. Its limited supply of 21 million coins and events called “halvings,” which reduce miners’ rewards every four years, affect its value and mining. Compared to other coins, Bitcoin is seen as digital gold—a store of value. Recent trends show renewed interest in Bitcoin as people look for alternatives to traditional money. While other cryptocurrencies offer different features, Bitcoin’s established network and early start make it attractive to many. Ethereum’s Leap into the Future: Scalability and Growth Await Ethereum has been a pioneer in the blockchain world since its launch in 2015. Created by Vitalik Buterin, it introduced smart contracts and a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications, or dApps. With the move to Proof-of-Stake through the Merge in 2022, Ethereum reduced its energy consumption and opened new possibilities for efficiency. Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon help speed up transactions and lower costs. The upcoming sharding phase aims to make the network even more scalable and affordable. Ether (ETH), the network’s native token, remains central, used for transactions, rewarding stakers, and as a tradable asset. In the current market cycle, Ethereum’s advancements make it a significant player to watch. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, its shift to Proof-of-Stake and focus on scalability set it apart. Predictions based on historical price movements and Bitcoin halving cycles estimate that ETH’s price could reach as high as $6,580.53 next year. By 2025, the yearly low is estimated at $2,700.31, with further growth expected up to 2030. These trends suggest that Ethereum may have considerable potential in the years ahead, especially as it continues to innovate and strengthen its network. Solana’s SOL Coin: The Fast Lane of Blockchain Technology Solana is making waves in the blockchain world with its focus on speed and scalability. Unlike some of its competitors like Ethereum and Cardano, Solana is designed to handle thousands of transactions per second without slowing down. This is great news for developers who want to build decentralized apps, known as dapps. Solana supports multiple programming languages, making it easier for more people to create on its platform. At the core of Solana is its native cryptocurrency, SOL. This coin powers transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards those who help keep the network running smoothly. Many see bright potential in SOL. Its technology allows it to support a high-capacity network, which is ideal for services that need to handle a lot of users at once. In today’s market, where fast and efficient blockchain solutions are in demand, SOL stands out. Compared to other coins, it offers quicker transaction times and lower fees. With the growing interest in areas like decentralized finance and NFTs, Solana’s capabilities make it a strong contender. For investors and developers looking for the next big thing in crypto, SOL could be an attractive option. XRP: The Fast and Borderless Currency Shaking Up the Crypto World Have you heard of XRP? It’s a digital currency that’s making waves. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP was designed to be fast, cheap, and accessible to everyone. Unlike traditional money, it doesn’t rely on banks or central authorities. Transactions are quick, secure, and can’t be reversed. With an initial supply of 100 billion, most of which was given to Ripple (formerly OpenCoin Inc.), XRP aims to make transferring money as easy as sending a text. In today’s market, XRP stands out for its speed and low costs. While some cryptocurrencies struggle with slow transfers and high fees, XRP offers a sleek alternative. It allows smooth payments across different currencies, making it valuable in our global economy. Ripple’s efforts to boost network liquidity and support the ecosystem could enhance XRP’s potential even more. Compared to other coins, XRP’s focus on real-world use makes it an attractive option. As the crypto world evolves, currencies like XRP that solve practical problems might lead the way. Conclusion BTC, ETH, SOL, and XRP are strong options, but XYZVerse (XYZ) aims higher with its sports-meme blend, targeting 20,000% growth and engaging a passionate community.

2025-06-08T07:19:14,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: Failure to Reclaim These Levels Can Result in a Sub-$100K Correction","Bitcoin has entered a corrective phase after tagging the $111K region, following a strong multi-week rally. While momentum has cooled, the broader structure remains intact. The price action is showing signs of potential accumulation at support, and traders are watching closely to see if this pullback turns into a deeper correction or a fresh leg up. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, BTC is currently holding above the $103K region after sweeping the $101K sell-side liquidity. The previous bullish structure is still valid, and the price is likely targeting the mid-range of the ascending channel. The 100-day (orange) and 200-day (blue) moving averages are not far below, sitting at $92K and $95K, respectively, and continue to slope upward. This indicates that the long-term bullish momentum is not yet broken. The RSI on the daily is recovering slightly from below 50, suggesting neutral momentum after days of cooling off. Until the asset breaks below the $100K–$101K range, the current drop looks like a healthy correction in an uptrend. However, failure to reclaim the $106K–$108K resistance area quickly could increase the probability of revisiting the $95K–$97K order block, and even the two moving averages. The 4-Hour Chart Zooming into the 4H chart, BTC wicked below the descending wedge pattern after finding strong demand near the $100K area and began a V-shaped recovery. This structure historically signals a bullish reversal, and the move back above $103K supports this case. However, the current rally is approaching resistance again, which is the higher boundary of the pattern near the $105K mark, and the RSI is still under 50. This level could act as a temporary ceiling unless momentum strengthens. The sharp wick below $100K looks like a textbook liquidity grab, suggesting market makers ran stops before driving the price higher. If the buyers manage to hold above the $100K base and flip the $105K–$106K area, the door reopens for a push toward $108K and possibly a new all-time high above $112K. On the other hand, a failure to do so would likely lead to more range-bound action between $101K and $106K in the coming days. On-Chain Analysis Exchange Reserve The Exchange Reserve chart reveals a persistent and steep decline in the amount of Bitcoin held on centralized exchanges, now reaching a historic low at 2.3 million BTC. This trend has accelerated over the past year and continues into June 2025, despite BTC trading above $100K. In classical supply-demand terms, this represents a significant supply-side squeeze: fewer coins on exchanges mean less liquidity available for instant sale, tightening the circulating supply and amplifying the impact of even moderate demand spikes. This behaviour reflects a strong macroeconomic undercurrent. First, institutional accumulation is likely driving much of this trend. Large entities often move coins off exchanges into custody solutions when positioning for long-term holding or to reduce counterparty risk. Second, the growing presence of spot Bitcoin ETFs and custodial platforms (like Fidelity or BlackRock) means that BTC is increasingly flowing into vehicles that don’t recycle it back onto exchanges, removing it from the liquid supply indefinitely. This dynamic creates structural illiquidity that underpins Bitcoin’s asymmetric upside.

2025-06-08T07:04:14,"Billionaire BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Warns $36,000,000,000,000 Debt Will ‘Overwhelm’ America Unless Stellar Economic Growth Achieved","The chief executive of the world’s largest asset manager just issued a dire warning, saying that the US will drown in debt unless the country finds a way to stimulate and grow the economy. Speaking at the 2025 Forbes Iconoclast Summit, Larry Fink details the remarkable pace at which the US has amassed an astronomical amount of debt. “After 223 years of being a nation in 2000, the [national debt] of the United States was $8 trillion. And in the last 25 years, both parties are guilty of this, [that number’s] now at $36 trillion. And now we have a pending tax bill that’s going to add $2.3 to $2.4 trillion on the back of that. If we don’t find a way to grow at 3% a year, real growth, we’re going to hit the wall.” Although the numbers are bleak, Fink believes the US can still climb out of its multi-trillion-dollar hole, outlining a number of steps that policymakers can take to spur real economic growth across multiple industries. “This is why we need to unlock more private capital… We need to be streamlining permitting, we need to be focused on rebuilding our infrastructure. If you believe that we’re going to be the leader in AI (artificial intelligence), we’re going to have, it’s estimated, a shortage of 500,000 electricians in this country. So, despite all of this pessimism, the foundation of growth is there. We just need to unlock it… If we cannot unlock that growth and if we’re going to continue to stumble along in a 2% economy, the [national debt is] going to overwhelm this country.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-08T06:36:26,"Why Bitcoin and Ethereum Will Never Compete With XRP in Global Payments","A tweet by crypto researcher SMQKE highlighted a point that is increasingly echoed by both academic research and industry observation: Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are structurally unfit for the demands of modern, high-volume global payments. The evidence presented supports the argument that scalability, cost-efficiency, and regulatory compatibility are critical for any digital asset to be integrated into institutional-grade financial systems. On all of these fronts, XRP significantly outperforms Bitcoin and Ethereum. Scalability Bottlenecks in Bitcoin and Ethereum Scalability, in the context of global payments, refers to the system’s ability to handle millions of transactions simultaneously with speed, reliability, and minimal cost. According to data cited in the images attached to the tweet, both Bitcoin and Ethereum process fewer than 20 transactions per second. This is a major constraint considering that modern banking infrastructure must scale to hundreds of thousands of transactions per second. As noted by IBM’s Lund, while newer systems are achieving up to 4,000 transactions per second in experimental setups, legacy blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum remain severely limited by their foundational architecture. WHY BTC AND ETH WILL NEVER COMPETE WITH XRP IN GLOBAL PAYMENTS Scalability means how well a system can handle lots of transactions at the same time, quickly and without high costs. Banks need this because they process millions of payments every day that must be fast and… https://t.co/N5tjg8GZ64 pic.twitter.com/PnuiSqLZc1 — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) June 5, 2025 Regulatory and Operational Incompatibility The high volatility and low scalability of BTC and ETH are further highlighted in academic literature. A 2022 publication available on Springer concludes that these assets are unsuitable as payment instruments in most distributed ledger technology (DLT) use cases due to these very limitations. Their underlying proof-of-work consensus mechanisms not only limit throughput but also make transaction confirmation times longer and energy consumption unsustainable. These technical deficiencies also create complications for compliance within regulated financial environments, further disqualifying BTC and ETH from institutional adoption in global payment systems. XRP’s Technical Design for Institutional Use In contrast, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) is cited in a separate academic paper on the EDISON-X energy trading system as an example of a DLT built for fast, low-cost, and scalable payments. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRPL uses a Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA) consensus mechanism, which enables transaction finality in 3–4 seconds, with a cost of less than $0.001 per transaction and the capacity to handle up to 1,500 transactions per second. These attributes make XRP suitable not only for peer-to-peer payments but also for enterprise-level applications such as energy trading and cross-border financial settlement. Institutional Preferences and Real-World Integration Furthermore, the scalability and low transaction latency of XRPL are central to its adoption by financial institutions. As highlighted in a Financial Times excerpt shared in the tweet, Ripple engineered its technology from the outset to handle hundreds of thousands of transactions per second. This design goal aligns with the operational requirements of major financial institutions such as Standard Chartered and Bank of America, which necessitate systems that can support large-scale, real-time transaction processing. SMQKE’s tweet argues that Bitcoin and Ethereum were not built for today’s payment environment, and available data supports this claim. XRP, on the other hand, was designed specifically for fast and reliable transactions within regulated frameworks. This distinction explains why banks and regulated financial entities have steered clear of BTC and ETH in operational payment infrastructure, reserving their usage for speculative purposes instead. In summary, technical scalability, regulatory alignment, and settlement efficiency are essential for digital assets to be used in global payments. XRP, through its consensus mechanism and system design, meets the scalability and compliance standards required for institutional adoption, making it a strong candidate for modern payment systems.

2025-06-08T06:30:57,"Still Holding BTC or BNB? Here’s Why Qubetics Might Be the Best Cheap Crypto to Buy Now","Blockchain just took another leap forward. The latest ETH L2 updates are slashing gas fees, and institutions are quietly increasing exposure to digital assets. Meanwhile, newer protocols are drawing in massive TVLs, showing that innovation is sprinting ahead. With the world edging closer to digital-first finance, traditional assets like stocks and bonds aren’t holding the same charm they once did. Instead, crypto projects with strong fundamentals and active communities are emerging as the preferred alternative for everyday buyers. And speaking of strong contenders, Qubetics is gaining serious traction. Positioned at the front of the new digital frontier, Qubetics is the world’s first web3 aggregator, fusing tools and services that power decentralized living. In a world that’s more digitally dependent than ever, this project doesn’t just ride the crypto wave—it builds the next one. Let’s compare Qubetics with the OGs: Bitcoin and BNB, and see which is the best cheap crypto to buy now. How Qubetics’ dVPN Could Be the Breakthrough Web3 Needs Decentralized VPNs (dVPNs) have emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional VPNs, offering censorship resistance, enhanced privacy, and user-driven infrastructure. However, despite their promise, most dVPN solutions today face critical challenges. These include poor user experience, limited network reach, low speeds due to fragmented node quality, and high technical barriers for both node operators and users. Many projects also suffer from weak economic incentives, making it difficult to maintain active, reliable nodes at scale. For the average user, setting up or navigating a dVPN can still feel overly complex and unreliable—limiting real-world adoption. Qubetics addresses these limitations by integrating dVPN functionality into its broader Web3 framework, enabling faster, more reliable, and user-friendly decentralized private networking. Its ecosystem is designed for seamless access—where users can connect to privacy-first routing infrastructure without managing complex setups or relying on underperforming node networks. Qubetics uses a token-based model that rewards node operators fairly while ensuring network stability and scalability. It also supports cross-chain integration and real-time performance validation, allowing users to connect securely across regions and protocols with confidence. For developers and enterprises, Qubetics offers SDK-level access to embed dVPN features directly into decentralized applications, making privacy not just an option, but a default layer within Web3 architecture. Final Presale Stage: From $0.01 to $0.3370—Last Chance Before Listing Qubetics began its presale journey at just $0.01 in Stage 1. Now in Stage 37, the final crypto presale stage, the token is priced at $0.3370, having raised over $17.7 million, distributed 515 million tokens, and attracted 27,500+ holders. Once this final allocation is sold out, $TICS will list publicly at $0.40, offering an immediate return of 18.71% to those buying in now. At the current rate, a $5,000 investment secures approximately 14,837 tokens. If the token reaches $1 post-launch, the value grows to $14,837. At $5, it climbs to $74,185. If it hits $10 or $15, the valuation jumps to $148,370 and $222,555 respectively. With the token supply reduced to 1.36 billion and 38.55% reserved for public distribution, Qubetics offers a rare mix of scarcity, utility, and early-mover advantage. Only 10 million tokens remain at this price—after that, the public market takes over. Bitcoin (BTC): The Unshakable Digital Reserve It’s the original, the heavyweight, the symbol of decentralized money. Still, it has earned its title as digital gold. It’s held by thousands of major buyers, corporate treasuries, and individual wallets worldwide, and it’s got the battle scars to prove it. Bitcoin’s value isn’t just in price. It’s in its network security, its first-mover advantage, and its unmatched decentralization. When markets shake, many still rush to Bitcoin. It’s a mainstay in the digital asset space, but for those scouting for the best cheap crypto to buy now, BTC might be more of a long-term stronghold than a near-term multiplier. The days of 1,000 percent gains might be in the rearview, but for those who want stability in a sea of volatility, Bitcoin continues to be the go-to. BNB (Binance Coin): The Backbone of the Binance Ecosystem BNB started as a utility token and grew into the glue holding the Binance ecosystem together. Whether it’s paying fees on Binance Smart Chain, participating in launches, or powering DeFi and NFT platforms, BNB is everywhere. BNB’s community is huge, with millions of users relying on it for day-to-day transactions across DeFi apps, staking protocols, and token swaps. That kind of use gives BNB real-world weight. It isn’t just speculative—it’s integral to daily blockchain use. But for new backers hunting the best cheap crypto to buy now, BNB may feel a bit pricey compared to tokens like $TICS, especially if the goal is catching early-stage growth. Still, its track record is solid. BNB exploded from a few dollars to hundreds in just a few years, proving that exchange-based tokens can become major players in the space. And with Binance constantly evolving, BNB remains a dependable bet for those looking for something with both utility and staying power. Why Qubetics Is Grabbing All the Spotlight Right Now The ongoing crypto presale of Qubetics has created a ripple effect in crypto circles for a reason. It’s not just about the potential gains. It’s about relevance. This project hits where modern issues lie—privacy, decentralization, access, and usability. Qubetics is the world’s first web3 aggregator, simplifying the decentralized experience into something anyone can use. Think about all the different services out there: VPNs, DeFi wallets, staking platforms, DEXs, aggregators, identity verification. Qubetics brings them under one roof with actual use cases. You’re not just holding a token—you’re part of a platform that does real work in the real world. That’s why it’s being seen as the best cheap crypto to buy now by early adopters who understand where tech is headed. Whether you’re someone who’s sick of handing your data over to centralized services or a professional needing secure, borderless communication, Qubetics delivers. And with each presale stage pushing the price up, those watching from the sidelines are starting to feel the heat. Once this thing hits exchanges, the whole vibe could shift fast. Final Thoughts: Ready or Not, Qubetics Is Coming 2025 isn’t the year to play it safe with tired assets. Between rising inflation and a digital-first future knocking at the door, there’s a growing call for assets that are nimble, tech-forward, and built for where the world is going, not where it’s been. Bitcoin holds the crown for being the pioneer. BNB has cemented its spot in the daily use category. But Qubetics? It’s making a serious case for being the best cheap crypto to buy now , especially for those tuned into real utility and tangible future gains. With massive presale momentum, promising ROI projections, and a platform tackling real-world problems, it’s not just a project—it’s a movement. If you’ve been watching from the sidelines, now’s the moment. The train’s still at the station—but it won’t be for long.

2025-06-08T04:35:02,"Crypto price prediction: Ravencoin, AB token, Keeta","The crypto market held steady during the weekend as traders focused on the upcoming US inflation data, which will determine the next actions by the Federal Reserve. Bitcoin traded at $105,000, while Ethereum’s price moved to $2,500. This article looks at some of the top trending coins like Ravencoin, AB, and Keeta. Ravencoin price analysis Ravencoin is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency created as a hard fork of Bitcoin. Its main difference with Bitcoin is that it has a supply cap of 21 billion, while Bitcoin has 21 million. RVN price surged recently after Upbit, the biggest South Korean exchange, listed it, giving it access to millions of customers. It moved to a high of $0.0257, the highest point since December last year, and then pulled back to $0.01570. Ravencoin price remains slightly above the key resistance level at $0.01428, the highest swing on May 13. It has also jumped above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a sign that bulls remain in control. Ravencoin price chart Ravencoin token also remains above the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level, while the MACD is pointing upwards. Therefore, the coin will likely continue rising as bulls target the 38.2% retracement point at $0.01912. A drop below the support at $0.0142 will invalidate the bullish outlook. Read more: Ravencoin (RVN) is pumping? Is it about Litecoin ETF speculation? AB price forecast AB is a blockchain project that offers a modular technology that supports fast and secure transactions, smart contract execution, and decentralized governance. The AB token price has jumped recently following its listing on several exchanges like Binance, Bitget, and MEXC. It has also done well as on-chain data shows that its network is starting to gow, albeit from a low base. AB has handled over 1.5 million blocks since inception and 29,792 transactions. It is handling about 2.6k transactions a day, while addresses have risen to 23,6111. However, its network utilization remains at 0.01%, meaning that it needs to supercharge its growth to justify its valuation. The daily chart shows that the AB price bottomed at $0.004084 on May 26 and then bounced back to $0.01040. It has moved slightly above the key resistance level at $0.01. The highest point on May 28. AB token price chart The Relative Strength Index and the MACD indicators have all pointed upwards. Therefore, technicals suggest that the AB token will continue rising as bulls target $0.015. However, AB is a thinly traded token, meaning that it may have extreme moves on some days. Keeta price forecast Keeta is a blockchain network that delivers over 10 million transactions per second. Its goal is to unify the blockchain industry by enabling users to move assets across multiple chains. It also lets users to create tokens that represent real-world assets. The two-hour chart shows that the Keeta token price has done well in the past few days as it moved to a record high of $1.4920, up 262% from its lowest point this year. Keeta token recently moved above the key resistance level at $1.2400, its highest point on June 3. Moving above that level invalidated the double-top pattern that was forming. Keeta price chart It has also retested that level, pointing to more gains, potentially to the psychological point at $2. A drop below the support at $1.2400 will invalidate the bullish Keeta price forecast.

The premier cryptocurrency, which had traded steadily within the $104,000–$106,000 range throughout the week, plunged to below $101,000 as tensions escalated between the two influential figures who attacked each other via their personally owned social media platforms i.e. X (formerly Twitter) and Truth Social. Since then, Bitcoin has shown some market resilience climbing back to around $104,000. With another consolidation developing, market analyst Crypto Daan has highlighted the price levels that are critical to the next price breakout. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Largest Net Taker Volume Drop Of 2025 – Traders React To Trump-Elon Clash Beyond $106K Or Below $100K – What’s Next For Bitcoin? The month of May proved largely bullish for Bitcoin as the digital asset surged from around $95,000 to establish a new all-time high near $112,000 marking the resumption of the larger crypto bull market. However, Bitcoin has noted a significant price correction since reaching this peak with market prices pegged around $104,000 on May 31. As seen in the first week of June, Bitcoin had hovered around $106,000 before its most recent price slump on Thursday. Due to this price action, Daan Crypto notes the digital asset is now trading within a price range of $100,000-$106,000, where it comfortably sits at the mid-range around $104,000. The analyst notes that if Bitcoin returns break below the lower range boundary at $100,000, the ongoing price correction could extend for 1-2 weeks. Going by BTC’s stairwell ascent in the past month, potential market support in such a bearish case would lie around $95,000 and $85,000. On the other hand, if the market bulls can force a return above the monthly high of $106,000, Daan Crypto explains that such development would indicate the market correction is over, and Bitcoin may be headed for another price discovery with potential initial targets of around $120,000.

2025-06-08T02:30:52,"Ethereum Enters Strategic Pause: Will Accumulation Below Resistance Spark A Surge?","In a post shared on X by UniChartz, it was noted that Ethereum (ETH) has developed a well-defined bullish structure, characterized by a series of Higher Highs (HH) and Higher Lows (HL), a classic signal of upward momentum. However, after this upward move, ETH has now entered an accumulation phase just below a key resistance zone, suggesting that the market is consolidating before its next potential breakout. EMA Confluence Zone Retest: Ethereum At Crucial Decision Point According to UniChartz, Ethereum is currently navigating a crucial technical juncture as it retests the confluence zone of the 50 EMA and 100 EMA, a region that has historically served as a strong area of demand. This overlap of exponential moving averages often acts as dynamic support, and its relevance is further underscored by the Stochastic RSI rebounding from oversold territory, which may signal an incoming shift in momentum. The analyst suggests that if ETH manages to hold this accumulation zone and support provided by the EMAs, it might open the door to another test of the overhead resistance zone , or potentially, a breakout beyond it. Traders will likely look for volume confirmation and continuation patterns to validate any such upside move. On the other hand, a failure to sustain this zone may signal weakness and lead to a deeper pullback , possibly dragging Ethereum toward lower support levels that have previously acted as stabilization zones. This would mark a temporary shift in market structure and attract more selling pressure in the short term. For now, UniChartz emphasizes that this area remains a critical decision point. The coming price action will be instrumental in shaping Ethereum’s next directional move, and traders should closely monitor whether bulls can defend the EMAs or bears regain control and force a breakdown . Key Levels To Watch In Event Of An ETH Breakout In the event of a confirmed breakout above the current accumulation zone and EMA confluence, Ethereum could be poised for a strong upward continuation. The first major level to monitor, which serves as the breakout trigger point, is the immediate $2,858 resistance zone that has capped recent advances.

A clean move above this area, especially with rising volume, would signal strong bullish intent. Once that resistance is cleared, the next key price level to watch lies near the $3,360–$3,659 range, which previously acted as a short-term supply zone and could present minor friction. Pushing beyond that could target the psychological zone around $4,100.

2025-06-08T02:15:41,"Qubetics $TICS Rise, Polkadot Growth, and Stacks Deals: Exploring the Top Cryptos to Join for 2025 Picks for 2025","Cryptocurrency markets are currently experiencing a pivotal moment marked by rapid regulatory shifts and technological breakthroughs redefining participants’ strategies. The buzz around the top cryptos to join for 2025 opportunities intensifies as traders and enthusiasts seek projects with strong fundamentals and real-world applications. Qubetics has emerged as a promising contender in this environment, capturing attention for its innovative approach to blockchain interoperability and its potential to reshape decentralized finance. As the search for the top cryptos to join for 2025 projects heats up, established tokens like Polkadot and Stacks also demonstrate resilience and steady growth. Each of these coins plays a distinctive role in the evolving crypto ecosystem, whether through exchange token utility, supply chain transparency, or multi-chain interoperability. These dynamics are creating a fertile ground for projects that can deliver both technological innovation and practical adoption. The quest for the top cryptos to join for 2025 is more than a race for early gains; it reflects a demand for projects that solve long-standing blockchain inefficiencies while preparing for the future of digital finance. Qubetics stands at the forefront of this movement, offering solutions that address interoperability challenges, enhance security, and streamline cross-chain asset management. This makes it an essential project to watch as blockchain networks grow increasingly interconnected. Qubetics: Bridging Blockchain Interoperability and Unlocking the top cryptos to join for 2025 in 2025 Qubetics ($TICS) continues to carve a compelling niche by tackling one of blockchain’s most persistent hurdles: interoperability. Its crypto presale , currently in the 37th stage, has seen over 515 million tokens sold to upwards of 27,500 holders, raising more than $17.7 million. The token is priced at $0.3370 during this stage, providing an attractive entry point into a project built on solid technological foundations and ambitious goals. Only 10 million $TICS tokens remain in Stage 37 of the Qubetics presale, priced at $0.3370. With over 515M tokens sold and $17.7M+ raised, this is your final opportunity before a 20% price increase at launch. Qubetics has slashed its supply to 1.36B, creating rare scarcity. Act now—or miss out. Recent developments showcase Qubetics’ growing ecosystem, notably through the QubeQode platform and the Qubetics Integrated Development Environment (IDE). These tools empower decentralized app developers and businesses to build cross-chain solutions with enhanced security features. Introducing a decentralized VPN further strengthens user privacy and secure communications, addressing concerns plaguing many contemporary blockchain networks. Polkadot: Connecting Blockchain Networks Through Parachain Innovation Polkadot is a leading multi-chain network that enables different blockchains to transfer messages and assets trustless. Developed by Web3 Foundation and co-founded by Ethereum co-creator Dr. Gavin Wood, Polkadot uses a unique relay chain mechanism to connect independent blockchains, known as parachains, allowing them to operate seamlessly within one ecosystem. This design eliminates bottlenecks and boosts scalability, making Polkadot one of the most forward-thinking Layer-0 solutions. The platform’s native token, DOT, is used for governance, staking, and bonding parachains—making it an essential component for ecosystem participation. Recent developments in the Polkadot ecosystem include accelerated adoption of parachain slots and increased community funding for decentralized applications (dApps). The network has seen a surge in developer activity, especially after the rollout of OpenGov, which offers decentralized on-chain governance to token holders. As Polkadot continues to emphasize interoperability and composability, it is increasingly viewed as a foundational layer for next-generation decentralized infrastructure. With over 550 active projects building on its ecosystem, Polkadot remains a top contender for scalable blockchain solutions in 2025. Stacks: Powering Bitcoin Smart Contracts and Web3 Utility Stacks is a unique Layer-1 blockchain that brings smart contract functionality and decentralized applications to Bitcoin without modifying the original Bitcoin protocol. By using a novel Proof of Transfer (PoX) consensus mechanism, Stacks anchors its security to Bitcoin’s robust network while allowing developers to build smart contracts using its Clarity language. The native token, STX, fuels transaction fees, smart contract execution, and participation in network consensus—creating a full-circle economy around Bitcoin-enabled DeFi and NFTs. The Stacks ecosystem has gained momentum recently due to increasing interest in Bitcoin Layer-2 scalability solutions and the rising demand for decentralized identity and finance on Bitcoin. With Stacks 2.1 now live and features like sBTC (a two-way pegged Bitcoin asset) under development, the platform is positioned to unlock a new era of programmable Bitcoin. This has sparked renewed enthusiasm among builders and institutions aiming to tap into Bitcoin’s liquidity with added functionality. As Bitcoin adoption grows globally, Stacks is seen as a vital bridge between Bitcoin’s store-of-value strength and modern decentralized use cases. Interoperability: Easing Blockchain Integration for All Users Interoperability remains central to Qubetics’ vision, delivering tangible benefits to businesses, professionals, and individuals alike: Businesses: Enable seamless multi-chain asset management and decentralized application integration, reducing operational complexity and costs. Professionals: Provide secure, private communication channels and collaborative environments powered by decentralized VPNs. Individuals: Grant users greater control over digital assets across different blockchain networks, fostering financial inclusivity and privacy. By simplifying interoperability, Qubetics lowers the barrier to blockchain adoption, encouraging ecosystem growth and innovative solutions that traditional finance systems struggle to match. Conclusion: Navigating the 2025 Crypto Landscape with Strategic Presale Opportunities Based on research and analysis, Qubetics, Polkadot, and Stacks represent some of the most compelling opportunities in the current market, each showcasing unique strengths that contribute to their standing among the top cryptos to join for 2025 projects in 2025. Identifying the top cryptos to join for 2025 involves looking beyond mere hype to projects delivering tangible innovation, solid partnerships, and real-world applications.

2025-06-08T02:09:17,"Coinbase ends legal battle with BiT Global over wBTC delisting","BiT Global agreed to dismiss its lawsuit against Coinbase for delisting the wBTC after the cryptocurrency exchange launched a competitor token, the cbBTC. In a filing , lawyers for BiT Global, an entity backed by TRON founder Justin Sun, who last year became a strategic partner to BitGo in providing the wBTC-wrapped Bitcoin token, said they had agreed to dismiss the suit with prejudice. This means the case cannot be brought again. Additionally, the two companies each said they would incur their own legal expenses in connection with the complaint Sun’s link to wBTC caused ETH DeFi protocols to stop supporting it as a collateral asset Wrapped Bitcoin tokens facilitate the use of Bitcoin on various blockchain networks. Both wBTC and cbBTC target the Ethereum ecosystem. However, the tokens do not offer any direct claim to the Bitcoin unless one trusts a central intermediary to custody the Bitcoin and release the wrapped token. Sun’s association with wBTC caused Ethereum DeFi protocols MakerDAO and Aave to contemplate disintegrating the support of the token as a collateral asset, ultimately deciding on tougher risk parameters rather than a complete exit. According to reports from credible sources, the lawsuit was filed in December 2024 by Kneupper & Covey on behalf of BiT Global, and it was claimed that if Coinbase delisted wBTC, it would be an example of anti-competitive behavior. It would also break several state and federal laws. The suit highlighted that having demonstrated the value represented by wBTC, Coinbase reversed course and removed wBTC from its platform. This made it impossible for anyone to trade it on Coinbase. The change came shortly after they launched their own similar version: cbBTC. Following the dismissal of the lawsuit, Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s top lawyer, stated that this important win affirms their clear right to manage security and risk for Coinbase users. Grewal added, “…we will not be bullied into continuing to list an asset that puts our customers at risk.” Previously, the exchange’s chief legal officer had defended its approach, stressing its dedication to high listing standards. He wrote on an X post that when an asset does not meet their listing standards anymore, they remove it. He further stated that they would add it to their list if another asset could meet or do better than market requirements while still following those standards. Grewal’s post faced criticism from crypto-industry insiders, including Tron founder Justin Sun, who accused the company of lacking transparency and asked how Grewal’s post squared with previous comments by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. An attached image provided by Sun depicted a screenshot of Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, who says Coinbase was agnostic to assets because it believes that consumers deserve options in the crypto economy. Mike Belshe defends BitGo as having a solid reputation after Sun’s backlash Earlier legal attempts to stop Coinbase from delisting the token were unsuccessful after a federal judge in December sided with Coinbase and said it had the right to delist the token. The transfer of wBTC from being managed only by the custody company BitGo to a partnership involving Sun faced backlash from people in the cryptocurrency world. In response to this criticism, BitGo CEO Mike Belshe revealed that he believes BitGo has a solid reputation because they follow the highest security standards in everything they do. Belshe concluded that Ultimately, he thinks people will see that this is not a big deal. The current market capitalization for the wBTC token is about $13.6 billion, with Coinbase’s cbBTC valued at about $4.7 billion, according to CoinGecko data. Both of these tokens are almost at an all-time high market cap.

However, the analyst emphasized that Bitcoin will ultimately dictate the move. Keeping a close eye on the intraday chart, the expert mentioned that an early pullback could present a scalp opportunity, as long as Bitcoin aligns with the bullish outlook. Breakout Likely With Strong Daily Candles Breaking down his latest analysis, the trader explained that LINK’s daily candle officially closed bullish, marking a key technical point in the current trend. Meanwhile, LINKBTC ended the session on a positive note, which adds weight to the bullish outlook for LINK in the short term. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus However, the analyst emphasized that more bullish daily closes on LINKBTC are needed to confirm momentum. A continuation of strength could lead to an impulsive breakout above the daily candle’s lower high trendline, igniting the next leg upward. A decisive move above the 0.000140 BTC resistance zone is expected to accelerate price action for LINK, giving bulls a clear signal to push higher. If momentum continues to build, LINK could rally toward the $16 resistance level, marking a major target for the current setup. For now, $12.50 remains a key support level on the daily timeframe and will act as a cushion if bearish pressure reemerges. Looking ahead, the analyst pointed out that Bitcoin and Bitcoin Dominance will remain the primary market drivers for Chainlink heading into the weekend. While maintaining a rational outlook, CRYPTOWZRD plans to monitor LINK’s intraday chart closely for any developing setups. Awaiting Chainlink Next Trade Setup In conclusion, CRYPTOWZRD emphasized that LINK’s intraday chart is showing signs of a bullish recovery, closely aligned with Bitcoin’s recent rebound. He expressed optimism that further upside is likely if current conditions persist, particularly if Bitcoin maintains its strength. Related Reading: Chainlink Holds Strong At $15.29 Support – Is A New Breakout Imminent? Despite the encouraging signs, CRYPTOWZRD noted that a temporary bearish pullback would be both natural and healthy within the current market context. Pullbacks often reset market conditions, providing better structure for stronger continuation patterns. He believes such a retracement could offer a favorable early entry point for long positions, especially for short-term or intraday traders looking to capitalize on the volatility. As the market continues to evolve, CRYPTOWZRD advises traders to wait for clear confirmation of the next trade setup before taking action. His statement emphasized that strategic patience will be key in identifying the most rewarding opportunities. For now, traders should track price behavior closely and prepare to act swiftly when the next valid entry signal presents itself.

2025-06-08T01:00:10,"Unstaked Grabs Spotlight With $1 Million Giveaway as Solana Moves Toward $300B and Pi Network Loses Momentum","Crypto sentiment heading into mid-2025 is anything but flat. Solana (SOL) is gaining fresh momentum with analysts speculating on a $300 billion market cap. In contrast, Pi Network (PI) continues to face headwinds, struggling with technical weaknesses and unclear progress. Yet, in a space where attention moves fast, one rising project is pulling focus. That project is Unstaked, a decentralized AI platform combining utility with zero-code tools. It has already sold over 1 billion $UNSD tokens, raised more than $9 million, and kicked off a $1 million Gleam giveaway that has both speculators and builders taking notice. With no private sales and a smart launch structure, Unstaked is being positioned as one of the most bullish crypto coins of 2025. Solana (SOL) Maintains Strength as Analysts Eye a $300B Milestone Solana is showing renewed signs of long-term potential. Price action is consolidating just above a major demand zone following what analysts call a “clean liquidity sweep” on the weekly chart. This pattern, which typically signals the end of a correction and the beginning of a new upward phase, has become a key bullish indicator. The case for Solana is not just about technical setups. On-chain activity continues to climb, with growing developer adoption and a steady expansion of its dApp ecosystem. Institutional interest is rising too, thanks to Solana’s performance efficiency and high transaction throughput. Market watchers are now looking for a retest of previous cycle highs, with targets suggesting a move toward $300 per coin. If realized, that would push Solana toward a $300 billion market cap, potentially making it one of the strongest bullish crypto coins to monitor in the year ahead. Pi Network (PI) Dips Deeper as Bearish Sentiment Spreads While Solana builds upward momentum, Pi Network is showing signs of sustained market weakness. At $0.61, PI has declined steadily from its recent high of $0.66, and technical indicators continue to reflect selling pressure. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dropped to 19.59, marking deep oversold territory. Meanwhile, the Williams %R sits at -94.213, and the MACD has confirmed a bearish crossover. The negative trend is not limited to the charts. Pi Network’s roadmap remains vague, and mainnet progress has been slow to materialize. Without a significant technical or market catalyst, the project appears to be losing favor among early adopters. Unless Bitcoin sees a resurgence or Pi delivers meaningful development updates, continued downside remains the base case scenario. In contrast to bullish crypto coins like Solana, Pi is lagging behind both in momentum and narrative strength. Unstaked Raises $9M and Launches $1M Giveaway as Momentum Builds While the broader market shifts between bullish and bearish sentiment, Unstaked is carving out a path of its own. Currently in Stage 19 of its crypto presale , the project has already sold more than 1 billion $UNSD tokens and raised nearly $9.1 million. At a current price of $0.011065 and a projected listing price of $0.1819, early adopters are eyeing a potential 28x return. But it’s not just about numbers. Unstaked’s protocol runs on a system called Proof of Intelligence, which allows AI agents to operate transparently and adapt through on-chain activity. The platform offers users the ability to create, deploy, and monetize these agents without writing a single line of code. With zero private allocations and fully public token access, Unstaked also presents a fair launch environment that appeals to both retail participants and community-first developers. It’s this combination of accessibility and innovation that positions it as one of the most bullish crypto coins to watch going forward. To amplify awareness and user engagement, Unstaked has rolled out a $1 million Gleam giveaway. Twenty participants will each win $50,000 worth of $UNSD tokens by completing simple tasks and purchasing at least $100 worth of tokens. This promotional campaign runs in tandem with the presale and is already drawing interest across Telegram, X, and crypto forums. The giveaway aligns closely with Unstaked’s roadmap and is being used to bring more wallets on-chain, spread awareness, and create buzz before the official launch. It’s also helping the project reach a wider audience of creators, DAOs, and builders who are looking for practical AI tools with direct application. With over 30% of the presale completed and tools scheduled for rollout shortly after launch, Unstaked is moving quickly and strategically. The project is emerging as more than a headline grabber, it’s becoming a serious contender for long-term growth. Final Thoughts: Utility, Access, and a Clear Road Ahead As we assess the crypto market landscape heading into the second half of 2025, a few key trends stand out. Solana is building strong structural support and targeting a $300 billion market cap, driven by clear fundamentals and market structure. Pi Network is facing steep challenges with weak momentum, limited development visibility, and declining investor confidence. Meanwhile, Unstaked is breaking through the noise. Its combination of AI-native tools, a decentralized and transparent distribution model, and a large-scale public giveaway is generating the kind of momentum rarely seen in presale projects. With over $9 million raised, strong product foundations, and a 28x upside baked into its pricing model, Unstaked could be the sleeper pick that defines the next market cycle.

During this period, the premier cryptocurrency crashed by an estimated 5% from $106,000 to trade below $101,000. Interestingly, despite the short-term volatility, several key technical indicators now point to a potentially bullish setup. In fact, this latest pullback appears to complete a series of signals that historically precede major price rallies. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Negative Funding On Binance – A Classic Setup For A Short Squeeze? Bitcoin Set For Price Surge, First Target At $130,000 In an X post on June 6, a market expert with X username CrypFlow shares a bullish Bitcoin prediction amidst an ongoing price correction. Aside from sharp price decline in the past week, the BTC market has witnessed a steady price correction since the premier cryptocurrency achieved a new-all time high of $111,970 on May 22. However, CrypFlow states that this price retracement alongside a host of other technical indicators suggest that Bitcoin is setting to repeat its price rally from Q4 2024. The first indicator observed by the analyst in the chart above is the golden cross which occurs when the 50-day simple moving average (50SMA) crosses above the 200-day simple moving average (200SMA) in early June 2025. The golden cross is a common bullish indicator that signals a shift in market momentum and was last seen in November 2024. Furthermore, there is a Bitcoin price breakout above a long-standing purple downward trendline that originated in December 2024. This breakout also mirrors another move seen in early November 2024, when BTC breached the descending resistance that began in March 2024. The ongoing price correction represents the final indicator as Bitcoin also suffered an estimated 10% price fall in November falling from $74,500 to $68,500 before initially an explosive price rally. CrypFlow’s analysis suggests that if Bitcoin is repeating its price rally from Q4 2024, the premier cryptocurrency could produce a 62% price gain translating into potential targets around $170,000. However, the analyst has set a more conservative initial price target of $130,000, representing a 25% gain from current market levels.

According to the settlement administrator, the distribution of settlement payments has now begun and will continue over the next several weeks. The 2021 cyberattack compromised the personal data of a staggering 76 million US customers, exposing names, addresses, Social Security numbers, and other sensitive information. T-Mobile agreed to the settlement in July of 2022 to resolve claims from the August 2021 breach. Customers eligible for payments will receive a digital deposit or paper check based on their selection during the claim process, with amounts ranging from $25 to $100, with some eligible for up to $25,000 for substantial documented losses. The settlement also includes two years of free identity protection services for affected customers. The breach, one of the largest in U.S. history, prompted lawsuits accusing T-Mobile of failing to secure customer data. T-Mobile says it has since enhanced its cybersecurity protocols to prevent future incidents, and the company did not admit to any wrongdoing in the settlement.

2025-06-07T23:00:45,"Crypto Analyst Says This Bitcoin Top Signal Hasn’t Gone Off Yet — What To Know","The story has been somewhat the same for the price of Bitcoin over the past week, drifting further from its recently-notched all-time high of $111,814. On Friday, June 6, the premier cryptocurrency fell towards the $101,000 level, reflecting an uptick in the market volatility over the past few days. While the Bitcoin price has quickly recovered from this sudden downturn, there is still real concern about the market leader’s performance since reaching its record-high value. However, a new indicator suggests that the price of BTC might still have some time to run up to a new high. Analyst Predicts Four Months Of Opportunity For BTC In a recent post on the X platform, crypto expert Joao Wedson revealed that there might still be some degree of opportunity in the Bitcoin market. This observation is based on a model, which was accurate in predicting past all-time high prices for the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Related Reading: Traders Turn Bearish on Bitcoin Following High-Profile Political Tensions, Data Shows This revelation is based on the Max Intersect SMA Model (the blue line), which has accurately identified the tops of past Bitcoin cycles. According to Wedson’s post, this cycle top prediction model suggests that the price of BTC could still have around four months of upward growth potential — regardless of the volatility and market shakeout. As seen in the chart above, the price of Bitcoin reaches its current cycle peak whenever the Max Intersect SMA (simple moving average) hits the previous cycle top. In the 2021 cycle, the top prediction model hit the 2018 high of around $19,000 in November 2021, culminating in a then-all-time high of $69,000. Hence, when this Max Intersect SMA hits exactly $69,000 — the price top in the last cycle, that will represent the peak of this current cycle. Wedson also asserted that this model is pretty reliable, as it is backed by 200 tested algorithms. With this top prediction model still a bit off $69,000, the Bitcoin price might still be some months away from its peak. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As mentioned earlier, the price of BTC seems to be struggling after recently hitting its current all-time high above the $110,000 mark. This week’s performance must have tested investors’ patience as the flagship cryptocurrency mostly traded within a consolidation range. Related Reading: Ethereum Stabilizes After Market Drop – Key MA Reclaim Could Trigger A June Rally According to data from CoinGecko, the BTC price is up by a mere 0.2% in the last seven days.

2025-06-07T22:25:28,"Understanding the Impact of High-Profile Feuds on Cryptocurrencies","The high-profile dispute between Donald Trump and Elon Musk has not only affected the stock market but also had a pronounced impact on the cryptocurrency sector. This analysis investigates how their disagreement, particularly surrounding the 'Big Beautiful Bill', has inadvertently acted as a promotional blitz for Bitcoin, while also benefiting two lesser-known altcoins. Bitcoin's Price Rally Amidst Tech Titans' Tussle Amidst the unfolding drama, Bitcoin has shown remarkable resilience and is currently trading between $102,410 and $110,000. The cryptocurrency seems poised for further gains, with potential targets pegged at around $121,600. Source: TradingView The support levels near $99,000 and the close proximity of the 10-day and 100-day price averages suggest a stable upward trajectory. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates that Bitcoin isn't yet overbought, which aligns with a bullish outlook for the near future. The Rally of Ethereum and Its Market Dynamics Ethereum, another major player in the cryptocurrency market, has also seen a notable uptick. The current pricing dynamics reveal a bullish trend, with the cryptocurrency trading between $2410 and $2729.90. Source: TradingView Despite a slight dip this past week, Ethereum has managed a 39% increase over the month, demonstrating substantial market confidence. If Ethereum can surpass the $2920 resistance, it might achieve a new high of around $3240, translating to an 18% gain from its current position. Innovative Cryptocurrencies Capturing Market Attention The Graphite Network has emerged as a notable entity in the crypto space, offering a unique approach to digital trust via its blockchain technology. The Graphite Network operates on the Polymer 2.0 Proof-of-Authority (PoA) blockchain, boasting a high transaction rate and predictable fees, positioning it as a strong contender against traditional financial systems.

2025-06-07T22:24:54,"Decoding the Chaos: What the Trump-Musk Clash Really Means for Bitcoin and These 2 Altcoins","The public schism between Donald Trump and Elon Musk has done more than just tank Tesla's stock—it has sent shockwaves through the crypto world. Their feud over the 'Big Beautiful Bill' became an unexpected marketing campaign for Bitcoin and has stirred up significant excitement around two specific altcoins that thrived on the chaos. Curious about which digital currencies are poised for a breakout fueled by this political drama? This article unpacks the recent events and reveals key insights into the potential market movers. Bitcoin's Bullish Surge Continues with Sights Set on $121k Target Source: tradingview Bitcoin currently fluctuates between $102,410 and almost $110,000, showing strong bullish control despite some resistance. The nearest challenge for bulls lies just above $114,000. If momentum continues, Bitcoin could aim for just over $121,600, a potential growth of roughly 12% from current levels. Support remains at around $99,000, giving investors confidence in a strong base. The 10-day and 100-day averages stay close, around $105,000, indicating stability. Bitcoin's RSI suggests it's not overly bought, pointing to room for growth. The recent one-month rise of about 9% highlights potential for further gains, indicating bears are currently held at bay. Ethereum Poised for Explosive Growth, Targets $3240 Source: tradingview Ethereum's price hovers between $2410 and $2729.90, showing slight bullish strength with recent gains of nearly 39% over the past month. However, a minor dip of less than 1% this week suggests some hesitation. The bulls seem slightly weak as they need to push past the $2920 resistance to gain momentum. If Ethereum breaks this level, it could climb over 18% more to approach the $3240 mark. Support is firmly set at about $2280, offering a safety net. Current analysis shows potential for growth, but the market waits to see if bulls can overcome these hurdles and surge past existing resistances. When Opinion Leaders Crash Value, Graphite Offers Trust That Doesn’t Wobble In a landscape where markets still react more to personality than performance, Graphite Network is building a blockchain where reputation is earned by verifiable action . It’s a bold reimagining of digital trust: structural, measurable, and immune to manipulation. Graphite Network runs on the Polymer 2.0 Proof-of-Authority (PoA) blockchain, capable of processing 1,400 transactions per second with consistent, predictable fees. That places it firmly in competition with traditional finance systems in terms of throughput and reliability, while offering the decentralization and auditability TradFi lacks. Beyond just optimizing speed, Graphite Network is redesigning the trust layer. One Account, One Reputation: A Clean Slate for Blockchain Identity Graphite Network enforces a one-account-per-user model via a setup fee paid in $@G, its native token . This model creates a powerful deterrent to spam, simplifies counterparty due diligence, and builds a cleaner, more accountable user base. At the heart of this identity layer is the Trust Score system that evaluates users based on behavioral signals: Transaction history KYC status (optional, but rewarded) Interactions with other verified accounts For decentralized apps, this system enables risk-aware user filtering, empowering platforms and users to set their own thresholds for trust. Graphite Network Bets Big on Reputation-Led Blockchain in 2025 When volatility has again exposed the emotional core of financial markets, Graphite Network is advancing a different thesis: that trust, if structurally embedded, can outperform hype. The core of its 2025 roadmap is a push to operationalize reputation as infrastructure where Layer-2 solutions will blur the line between blockchain and behavioral credibility. Among its flagship rollouts: Phonebook Reputation MVP: A decentralized ID model linking Trust Scores to phone numbers via smart contracts. The goal is to allow users to evaluate counterparty risk in real-time using a phone number as a proxy for on-chain trustworthiness. Hotspot Bundle Initiative: A hardware-software package designed to onboard remote and underbanked populations into the Graphite ecosystem. Participants will be able to operate nodes and earn income, effectively lowering the barrier to Web3 participation. Geo Game Powered by DePIN: An educational gaming product simulating real-world macro conditions such as inflation and resource scarcity. Users will interact with on-chain economies in a controlled, gamified environment. Graphite Network brings the blockchain one step closer to real-world usability: a trusted, intuitive environment for everyone — from everyday users to enterprise builders. Learn More about Graphite Network Conclusion In decoding the market chaos from the Trump-Musk clash, a clear, multi-layered picture emerges. The feud reinforced Bitcoin's dominance as the market's safe haven and highlighted Ethereum's position as a major altcoin poised for its own breakout. Beyond these leaders, the event also shined a spotlight on projects like Graphite Network, which offers not a trade on the current system, but a fundamental investment in a new one immune to such political drama. The key takeaway is that the chaos creates distinct opportunities: to ride the momentum of established leaders or to invest in the foundations of a more stable future.
