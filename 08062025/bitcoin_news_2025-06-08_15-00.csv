2025-06-08T12:30:49,"Bitcoin Rebound From $100,000 – Healthy Pullback Or Start Of Deeper Correction?","On Thursday, Bitcoin (BTC) prices dipped to below $101,000 as fallout between US President Donald Trump and world’s wealthiest man Elon Musk rocked the US financial markets. However, in the past 48 hours, the maiden cryptocurrency has registered a rebound climbing to above $105,000 before slipping into a sideways movement. Amidst these developments, a popular crypto analyst with X pseudonym KillaXBT has outlined multiple scenarios for Bitcoin’s next price action. Behind Bitcoin’s Rebound From $100,000 In an X post on June 7, KillaXBT provides a profound technical analysis of the Bitcoin market discussing the recent price rebound and potential developments moving forward. After reaching a new all-time high near $112,000 on May 22, BTC entered a corrective phase falling by an estimated 10% into the $100,000 price range, before it’s recent rebound in the past two days. KillaXBT explains this rebound is not random and was driven by a combination of technical and market factors. These factors include the daily FVG and volume imbalances which are price filled inefficiencies left behind on the chart. Furthermore, there was a liquidity sweep as Bitcoin’s steady decline pushed prices below the previous weekly lows triggering many stop-losses from long positions. This development created a flush of liquidity for big players which served as a fuel in driving a market rebound. Finally, KillaXBT talks on a short squeeze setup whereby the Bitcoin market turned short heavy when traders expected a further downside following the initial price bounce from $100,000. When prices started going up, these short traders had to buy back to cover their losses, adding more fuel to the rally. What Next For BTC? Looking to the future, KillaXBT has highlighted three potential scenarios for BTC. Presently, the analysts states the premier cryptocurrency is retesting a resistance zone between $104,800-$106,000 which aligns with the 0.5-0.618 Fibonacci retracement levels of the recent price drop. For the first scenario, KillaXBT foresees a bullish continuation only if Bitcoin breaks and holds above this resistance region. Such a move could trap short sellers once again, potentially fueling further upside momentum. However, if Bitcoin faces rejection at this specified resistance area, the second scenario comes into play, in which the price is likely to decline and retest the $100,000 support level. The third, final and worst case scenario includes a price break below the $100,000 leading Bitcoin to retest support zones around the $97,000 price region. Interestingly, KillaXBT’s personal projection expects market makers to continue driving Bitcoin’s price higher, capitalizing on the recent sharp rebound that caught many short traders off guard. With no clear “safe” long entry yet available, the analyst suggests that pushing prices further would trap more short sellers while forcing sidelined bulls to chase the rallyAt press time, BTC continues to trade at $105,600 reflecting a 1.16% gain in the past day.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-rebound-100000-pullback-deeper-correction/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin correction|Bitcoin resistance|Bitcoin support|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Donald Trump|Elon Musk",cryptocompare

U.S. District Judge Anthony Trenga in Alexandria, Virginia, partially denied Capital One’s motion to dismiss the proposed class action, reports Reuters . The suit focuses on Capital One Shopping, a free browser extension designed to search for online coupons, better prices and rewards at over 100,000 online retailers. But the plaintiffs say Capital One stole from bloggers, influencers, and YouTubers by overriding their tracking codes and diverting affiliate marketing commissions from creators during the checkout process. They accuse Capital One of unjust enrichment, interfering with their contracts, and violating the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Judge Trenga ruled that plaintiffs Jesika Brodiski and Peter Hayward plausibly argued that Capital One should have known that it was diverting payments by overriding web cookies containing data on commissions. Capital One denies the allegations. “Capital One Shopping does not replace affiliate marketer cookies or unlawfully take credit for commissions. We disagree with the allegations in the complaint and look forward to defending ourselves in court.” Capital One was also recently accused of misleading clients by not telling them about higher-yielding 360 Performance Savings accounts, allegedly preventing customers from accessing better interest rates, keeping their 360 Savings account rates as low as 0.3%.

The idea, first sparked by crypto trader Vladcoin, is now being seen as a real possibility by Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas. He believes there’s a strong chance we could see this unique fund by 2026. ETF Analyst Sees a Real Chance In response to Vladcoin’s idea of having an ETF that buys and sells meme coins based on how well they perform, buying the promising ones and selling off the weaker ones. Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said there’s a “really good chance” that an actively managed meme coin ETF could exist in the future. However, he added that it would probably take some time to happen. Really good chance this exists at some point. First we’ll get slew of active crypto ETFs (eta Winter 2025). Active meme coin-only likely 2026 tho. The return dispersion (and lack of sell side coverage) ripe for active. Could produce next star manager. Who knows. https://t.co/9CcEc4xmev — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) June 7, 2025 He expects to see many active crypto ETFs launch by winter 2025, but a meme coin-only active ETF is more likely to come around 2026. Meanwhile, polygon-based prediction market Polymarket predicts that Dogecoin ETF will see approval by the end of 2025 with a probability of 44% . No Meme Coin ETFs Yet While we don’t have a meme coin-only ETF yet, the idea isn’t completely out of the blue. Several big asset managers have already launched or filed for spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, including BlackRock, Fidelity, and VanEck. These funds have been very popular, bringing in billions of dollars in assets within months. Some smaller players have also filed for “crypto basket” ETFs that invest in a mix of digital assets, but so far, no one has filed for a meme coin-only ETF. Still, the idea is gaining interest. Why Meme Coins? Eric believes that meme coins could be perfect for active management. Meme coins like Dogecoin , Shiba Inu, and Pepe are known for their huge price swings and hype-driven moves. Many don’t have traditional research or clear fundamentals, which makes it hard to know which ones will survive. Eric also hinted that if this kind of ETF comes to life, it could create a new star in the investing world.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/meme-coin-etfs-to-be-launched-by-2026-says-senior-bloomberg-analyst/,"BTC|DOGE|ETH|SHIB|TRADING","News",cryptocompare

Bitcoin ( BTC ) was trading at $105,550 on Sunday, June 8, up by 5% from its lowest point last week. It remains 5.75% below its highest point this year. Bitcoin has wavered recently because of investor profit-taking . In May, its price surged to a record high of $111,900, a 50% surge from the lowest level in April. BTC also wavered as data pointed to outflows from exchange-traded funds. SoSoValue data shows that these ETFs shed $128 million last week after shedding $157 million a week earlier. It was the first back-to-back weekly outflows since April. Further data shows that sentiment among crypto investors has turned neutral this month. The closely-watched fear and greed index has dropped to the neutral point of 56. Bitcoin has also wavered after reports emerged that China was considering selling its seized coins. Data shows that it holds 190,000 coins worth over $20 billion.

Other firms like MetaPlanet and The Blockchain Group are intensifying their purchases. Bitcoin price technical analysis BTC price chart | Source: crypto.news The other Bitcoin catalyst is its solid technicals. The daily chart shows that it has slowly formed a cup-and-handle pattern and is completing the handle section. Bitcoin has also remained above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, which provide substantial support. It has also remained above the major S/R pivot point of the Murrey Math Lines tool. Therefore, the coin will likely bounce back in the coming weeks. The initial target is the cup’s upper side at $109,477. After moving above the all-time high of $111,900, it may surge to $150,000.

According to reports, the investment platform masquerades as InnBucks Investment, luring innocent people into depositing their funds using Ecocash, which is moved to the fake trading platform. According to local reports, the platform promises residents in Zimbabwe the opportunity to make profits from Bitcoin trading, agreeing to trade the asset on their behalf. They are asked to register accounts on the Amexcyp Market platform using their specialized link. “Here is an opportunity to make x3 of your investment without any hidden fees or withdrawal fees 100% safe and secure. And also have access to your trading account. Send us a message now to start,” one of their advertisement posts reads. Zimbabwe residents lose funds to bogus investment platform According to reports, the platform has other types of advertisements spread across Facebook , targeting unsuspecting residents of the country. “Other platforms may falter, but we remain the best place for safe and secure coins trading in Zimbabwe. Trade on InnBucks investment today!” another post read. However, it was discovered that the platform had no connections to InnBucks, with the platform releasing a post on its Facebook page warning its users. “Stay vigilant, stay safe. Never share your InnBucks PIN, OTP, or ID number with anyone. InnBucks does not carry out Investment schemes, always verify the authenticity of pages through our official channels—call us on 569 or message us on our official social media platforms. Be on the lookout for fake pages and scammers like the ones below,” InnBucks posted, attaching some of the fake platform’s posts. According to investigations carried out by Bulawayo24 , the fake trading platform’s posts have a WhatsApp number attached, with the number belonging to an agent called Michelle Chiunda, claiming she is from InnBucks Investment on Facebook. The attached number only connects through WhatsApp and a call is always received by a party that is oblivious to either the trading investment platform or its WhatsApp account. Upon enquiry, “Chiunda” mentioned that the WhatsApp number was registered in her sister’s name, claiming the name, Katanda, which was attached to the number, is also her surname. Meanwhile, upon calling the number, it was answered by a woman who seemed unaware that her number was being used to lure people into InnBucks Investment on Facebook, pointing to the fact that the number might have been hacked. Fake investment officer reveals operations Confirming the advertisement made on Facebook, Chiunda mentioned that if a client in Zimbabwe invests $100 on the platform, the company will take charge of the trading on their behalf using their auto-electronic mining machine. This machine is 100% guaranteed for locking all incoming profit, it also keeps the trade signal stable to prevent any negative effect from MARKET-CAP,” she said. She added that the trade takes 24 hours to complete, and once it is done, the user is guaranteed X10 of their investment, while the company keeps the remaining X3 part of the profit. Chiunda said that users in Zimbabwe can receive their profit from any account, highlighting that they pay to Ecocash, Innbucks, or Mukuru. She mentioned that as soon as a user signifies their intention to invest, a link is sent to them where they can register. For a user in Zimbabwe to register on the trading platform, they must send their details to Chiunda to help them register or click on the amexcypmarket link that she sends to them. After registration, the user is expected to send a screenshot of the interface to her before they proceed with their initial investment starting from $50. She also claimed that the platform is in association with InnBucks, a party that has already distanced itself from the scam, and indicated that the authorities have been alerted.

2025-06-08T12:00:00,"Bitcoin: Tweezer Bottom Indicates A Reversal Is Possible (Technical Analysis)","Summary Bitcoin's recent chart appears to show a textbook tweezer bottom, signaling a likely bullish reversal after its recent downtrend. If Bitcoin continues this reversal of sentiment, I expect a move higher and a potential test of prior highs in the near term. A confirmed tweezer bottom would mark strong buyer intervention and a probable shift in market sentiment toward new highs this summer. If $100K fails to hold, the bullish thesis is invalidated; price action this week should confirm whether a sustained reversal is underway. Recent price action in Bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) chart appears to show a textbook tweezer bottom. A tweezer bottom is a bullish reversal candlestick pattern that sometimes appears at the end of a downtrend. If this is the case, Bitcoin may be ready to make a reversal and potentially break out to new highs in the near term. For this reason, so long as Bitcoin stays above its June 6th close, and does not breach the apparent bottom it made on June 5th and 6th, Bitcoin appears ready to reverse course, move higher, and test upside resistance in the near term. Tweezer bottoms are characterized by two consecutive candlesticks that share the same low price, or very close to it, where the first is the same, low price. Here's a breakdown of its key characteristics: The tweezer pattern has to form following a clear downtrend, which Bitcoin was in for the last few weeks, since making an all-time high in the second half of May. Recent Bitcoin Candlestick Chart (Finviz, with red notations by Zvi Bar) The tweezer bottom starts with a relatively large bearish candle that would generally indicate a continuation of selling pressure, or possibly a sizable capitulation. That move is immediately followed by a bullish candle that is usually of similar size, but what matters most is that its low point is in line with the prior bearish candle. This indicates that despite initial selling pressure evidenced by the bearish move, buyers stepped in at the same price point and prevented further declines before moving the price higher. These consecutive matching lows are likely to mark a strong level of support that implies sellers attempted to push price lower, and that this push lower was rejected. As a result, a tweezer bottom represents a probable reversal of the recent trend down, and a move higher in the near term. If this most recent action is indeed a tweezer bottom, a change in market sentiment through the next few weeks is probable. 1-Year Bitcoin Candlestick Chart (Finviz with red notes by Zvi Bar) It is apparent that a reasonable level of seller exhaustion occurred. Bitcoin had downward momentum since making a top in the middle of May, and faced downward pressure since failing to break through apparent resistance around $111,000, or around its all-time high. The downward momentum within the first bearish candle of the tweezer bottom then faced significant opposition at just above $100,000, and sellers were unable to push Bitcoin lower. The subsequent bullish candle indicates and/or confirms buyer intervention. Bouncing off the same low demonstrates that buyers consistently and likely aggressively stepped in at that level, absorbing selling pressure and reversing price direction. This indicates a return of buying interest and a potential shift in market sentiment. The matching lows also create a strong level of support that appears likely here to signify a near term price floor from which Bitcoin could jump-start a recovery. The confirmation of whether the move last week was a tweezer bottom comes from the subsequent price action. A sustained move higher after the apparent formation validates a reversal. Similarly, the tweezer bottom’s support should also subsequently act as support on another move downward, and become a critical level where buyers must successfully defend against further price depreciation, or a continuation and potential acceleration of the pre-existing downtrend becomes exceedingly probable. If Bitcoin has, in fact, formed a tweezer bottom, this may represent a significant development for sentiment around Bitcoin and the potential for it to make new highs this summer, and possibly even before summer’s technical start. Risk While this pattern may suggest that a critical low was established as support, and that selling pressure has waned, it is also possible that the level of support created by the apparent tweezer bottom shall not hold. It could be the case that the second candle’s bullish appearance was due to other temporary forces, such as Friday's weekly options expiration or the capricious influences of recent government actions. Other influences would include changes to interest rates, dollar weakness, and general sentiment towards competing safe haven and alternative assets. In either case, it should be expected that market activity this week will confirm whether this is, in fact, a tweezer bottom, and continued upside momentum should be expected, or if this was a temporary respite to be followed by further declines. Conclusion I believe it is highly likely that Bitcoin just made a tweezer bottom that will act as a strong level of support, and it is likely that Bitcoin is at the start of a reversal that will test its prior high. If Bitcoin cannot hold $100K, it would invalidate this theory and indicate continued selling pressure. If Bitcoin confirms the tweezer bottom in the coming days, it is also reasonably likely that Bitcoin can make a new high in the near term, and potentially move considerably higher.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4793234-bitcoin-tweezer-bottom-indicates-a-reversal-is-possible-technical-analysis?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING","BTC-USD",cryptocompare

2025-06-08T11:39:48,"Bitcoin at the Brink: Double Top or $150K Moonshot, What’s Next?","Bitcoin is currently trading around $105,500, up a modest 1.1% in 24 hours, after a volatile week that saw prices swing between $100,400 and $106,500. While short-term price action appears calm, with the king cryptocurrency locked in a narrow 24-hour range of $103,500 to $105,800, underlying signals hint at seismic moves ahead. And with the asset now 6.2% down from its May 22 all-time high, the crypto community is divided: double top or liftoff? Double Top Déjà Vu? Pseudonymous analyst Cryptowizard took to X on June 7 with a chart comparison between Bitcoin’s current structure and the infamous 2021 double top. “Bitcoin’s price action is starting to look familiar,’” they wrote. “Just like in 2021, we’re seeing a potential double top formation plays out. Are we setting up for a retrace or $150K next?” That question has ignited debate across the community. Investor Trade Pro isn’t buying the bearish narrative. “Make no mistake about these pullbacks. I think they are buying opportunities… All signs point to strong continuation to new all-time highs,” they asserted, citing strong on-chain metrics. Backing that bullish case, Gracy Chen of Bitget says the macro picture is playing directly into Bitcoin’s hands. Trump’s latest 1% rate cut proposal and over $500 billion in expected U.S. Treasury borrowing by Q4 hint at a liquidity tsunami. “Globally, monetary easing is no longer a question of if, but when,” she noted, calling BTC the ultimate hedge in a world increasingly skeptical of fiat stability. “Bitcoin was built for these shifts.” Market watcher Axel Adler Jr. also noted that the 30-day volatility is now “highly compressed,” a setup that could just be the basis for a substantial market swing. Meanwhile, institutional buying continues to lock up supply. Swan CIO Ben Werkman pointed out that allocators, rather than traders, are driving this cycle, accumulating BTC without intent to sell. “62% of Bitcoin hasn’t moved in over a year,” noted Swan, suggesting that historic dormancy often precedes liftoff, as was the case in 2016 and 2020. Resistance Ahead? Still, not everyone is convinced the pump is near. According to Glassnode, at this time, the Short-Term Holder Cost Basis sits at just above $97,000 , with crucial thresholds at $83,200 and $114,800. The blockchain analytics firm predicts that a break below $100,000 could ignite another liquidation cascade, especially after Friday’s $988 million in long liquidations triggered by the very public tiff between U.S. President Donald Trump and his erstwhile political ally, Elon Musk. Even Daan Crypto Trade isn’t ruling out a deeper retracement. “Below yesterday’s lows at ~$100K and I think we’ll keep trending down for another 1–2 weeks,” he posted on X, pointing to BTC’s weakening correlation with stocks and a sluggish bounce from recent lows.

Ever since hitting its May low of $93,232, Bitcoin has rebounded and analysts say the $106,000–$106,500 range will act as strong resistance for the cryptocurrency. While writing, Ethereum (ETH) is trading above $2,628.42, adding around 0.52%. The coin is now toughing it out at a critical stage of $2,725, where it has met with challenges while progressing this week. Buying these cryptos right now is considered smart, because they open many opportunities for investors. Crypto investors are now paying more attention to upcoming altcoins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as high-potential investments. Mutuum Finance Presale Surges as Investor Interest Grows MUTM utilizes a two-way lending model that has made the project take center stage as far as speedy adoption by users is concerned. More than 11,700 investors have invested $10.1 million in the presale pointing to the success of the project. MUTM token will cost $0.035 in Phase 6 which means its price is set to appreciate by 16.67%. That presents investors with an opportunity for high returns. Through both market demand and strong lending approaches, Mutuum Finance is an intriguing DeFi project. Mutuum Finance’s Lending Platform Gains Trust as Certik Audit Wraps Up The Mutuum system brings together both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. With P2C, individuals can gain rewards from USDT pools and automated smart contracts and P2P gives them full power to handle direct cryptocurrency payments. Because of these factors, trading in DeFi has become safer, more convenient and more attractive for high-yield investors. Mutuum Finance is building a fully collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin to be issued on the Ethereum network. Its overcollateralized design ensures long-term price stability, avoiding the collapse risks that have affected algorithmic stablecoins. The platform is powered by open-source smart contracts that have now been officially audited and certified safe by Certik, providing a strong foundation for user trust and paving the way for institutional adoption. Rewarding Early Investors and Growing the Community Mutuum Finance is encouraging people to join by offering attractive rewards to early investors. Ten lucky participants in the ongoing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) $100,000 giveaway will be rewarded with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. Since Bitcoin and Ethereum have passed $105,000 and $2,000, respectively, investors believe in their continued growth. Along with this, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining attention after raising over $10.1 million from more than 11,700 participants in its presale. MUTM is currently $0.03 and it is forecasted to go up 16.67% very soon, so buying it now could potentially earn potential investors double their initial investment by purchasing at its initial offering of $0.03. Being able to lend money using a new system and providing a stablecoin makes it attractive in the world of DeFi. Thanks to these early supports and increasing appreciation, MUTM proves itself to be valued as much as BTC and ETH.

In a new interview on PBS’s Amanpour and Company, Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, says that the US government is in a situation where it absolutely must lower its budget deficit as a percentage of GDP from 7% to 3%. According to Dalio, the government must take a three-step approach to lowering the deficit-to-GDP ratio if it wants to avoid a “very high likelihood of real problems.” “It has to be done with three things, and it has to be spread out among these three things, because any one of those three things would be too painful. Those three things are tax revenue, spending cuts and interest rates. Although Congress and the president in the process does not deal directly with the third of those, right now a trillion dollars – half of our deficit – is interest payments, and not only do we have a trillion dollar interest payment, in the next year, we have nine trillion dollars of debt maturing that has to be either rolled over or sold… So there’s what I call my 3%, three-part solution, which was very similar to 1991-1998. It was cut by 5% of GDP, the budget deficit, in those years was cut by 5% of GDP by spreading it around. So those are the three things that are needed.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-08T10:45:50,"Bitcoin Eyes Breakout as Traders Watch Key Levels","Bitcoin held firm near $105,500 on June 8, signaling that its recent corrective phase may be nearing an end. The move followed a dip to $100,500 on June 5, but BTC/USD has since staged a steady recovery, nearing its weekly open. Bullish Momentum Reappears Popular analyst Rekt Capital noted signs of strength on the daily chart. “On the Daily timeframe, Bitcoin is showcasing signs of breaking its two-week Downtrend… while also turning it into support earlier today,” he said on X. He added that a daily close and retest around $106,600 would solidify a bullish continuation. Other traders, like SuperBro, also pointed to Bitcoin closing above its 10-day simple moving average as a positive sign. That metric, according to SuperBro, helps invalidate bearish scenarios. Liquidity Signals Suggest Imminent Volatility Trader Cas Abbe examined order book liquidity and observed building pressure both above and below spot price. He suggested this setup could lead to a “magnet-style” price move. “BTC liquidation cluster is now signalling an upside move,” he said. Abbe noted that a 10% price increase could liquidate $15.11 billion in shorts, while a 10% drop would impact $9.58 billion in longs. He also pointed to negative funding rates as evidence of mounting short positions. “I think BTC big move is coming next week, possibly pushing it above $109K–$110K,” he predicted. Key Support Levels Remain in Focus Some analysts are still preparing for a possible retest of lower support zones. Trader CrypNuevo said $100,000 remains a strong psychological support. “100k is the strongest psychological support… it’s the area where I’m building some longs with easy invalidation below it,” he explained. Rekt Capital Eyes Weekly Close Importance Rekt Capital also highlighted the importance of Bitcoin holding above $104,400 for a fourth consecutive weekly close. He described the retest following May’s all-time highs as “successful,” adding further weight to bullish sentiment.

Ardoino took to blogging platform X, saying that the stablecoin issuer has no such plans, days after its rival Circle made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Ardoino mentioned it while he was replying to a post about the company’s valuation. The post came days after Circle, which is behind the USDC stablecoin, entered the public market. Circle performed well on its first day, with its shares climbing 167% on its first trading session on the NYSE. The company’s shares opened at $31, before moving up by 235% in the first hours of negotiation, before closing at $82 at the end of the day. The performance showed that there is a growing market appetite for the stablecoin business. Tether CEO discusses Tether’s valuation Ardoino also addressed the speculation raised by Artemis CEO Jon Ma, who was speaking about Tether’s valuation. Ma mentioned that if Tether, who backs the USDT stablecoin were to go public, it would rank as the 19th largest company globally. He backed his claim with a table showing different companies and their current valuation. The table had companies like Microsoft, Nvidia, Apple, and Amazon, among others. Tether valuation at 515B is a beautiful number. Maybe a bit bearish considering our current (and increasing) Bitcoin + Gold treasury, yet I'm very humbled. Also truly excited for the next phase of growth of our company. Thank you everyone❤️ https://t.co/exZc05SDwd — Paolo Ardoino 🤖 (@paoloardoino) June 7, 2025 In his postulation, he noted that Tether, with a valuation of around $515 billion, will be larger than global giants like Costco and Coca-Cola. However, Ardoino was not impressed with the valuation. The Tether CEO noted that while the $515 billion valuation was a beautiful number, it might actually be too low for the company. “Maybe a bit bearish considering our current (and increasing) Bitcoin + gold treasury, yet I’m very humbled,” Ardoino said. Ardoino added that he is excited for the next stage of Tether’s growth . Meanwhile, popular Bitcoin advocate Anthony Pompliano also backed Ardoino’s stance, highlighting that the company has what it takes to hit the $1 trillion mark eventually. The stance was also shared by another prominent figure in the community, Jack Mallers, who mentioned that he hopes the company eventually reaches the valuation very soon. New inroads and investments Tether-backed stablecoin USDT currently ranks as the third-largest in the cryptocurrency market by market cap. It is valued at $154.83 billion at the time of writing, according to CoinMarketCap. The company has also been making investments in the crypto market, announcing in April that it would become a majority owner of Twenty One Capital, a new Bitcoin treasury company founded by Strike executive Jack Mallers. Despite its recent launch, Twenty One has become the third-largest holder of Bitcoin, coming behind Strategy (MicroStrategy) and mining firm MARA Holdings. Some days ago, Tether moved 37,229 Bitcoin, worth about $3.9 billion into the Bitcoin native financial platform. According to his post on X, he made three transactions totaling 25,812 BTC worth about $2.7 billion at the time before making a $730 million transfer and following it up with a $500 million BTC transfer. Twenty One Capital wants to develop Bitcoin-native capital markets infrastructure, allowing products like lending, custody, and asset issuance to operate directly on Bitcoin rails. It also has plans to go public using a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) merger that would involve Cantor Fitzgerald’s Cantor Equity Partners, which values the company at $3.6 billion.

2025-06-08T09:47:57,"AI could destroy crypto within five years | Opinion","Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. AI has been evolving at breakneck speed and is becoming an indispensable and useful tool across many industries for business and consumer-facing functions, including the finance industry. The fast adoption of AI is largely driven by its low barriers to entry, where anyone with a computer and internet connection can interact with AI and develop it. Yet, as AI grows, it brings severe risks: AI is already sufficiently advanced to assist human-led hacking through LLMs and AI agents. You might also like: AI is crypto’s redemption, and the next generation’s big bet | Opinion Within five years, AI will develop capabilities to hack on another, far more dangerous front: through Artificial General Intelligence. Once AGI is achieved, it won’t be controlled by people. Unless governments and regulators step in now (even then, the chances of controlling it are slim), AGI will escape the confines of its creators and autonomously hack cryptocurrency encryptions… and entire global digital systems. The rise of artificial intelligence AI has seen a dramatic surge in the commercial arena, one of its most recent iterations being AI agents. These are finely tuned, complicated systems, geared to perform specialized tasks and make decisions with minimal human intervention. Already transforming the tech space and becoming a useful everyday tool for many basic human interactions, such as self-driving cars, fraud detection , on-chain trading, and application creation. The next evolution will be AGI , a complex system that can do everything a human can. It will not need human prompts or intervention; it will simply have real-time autonomy: the ability to perform tasks, but also recognise when a task needs performing. This is set to be achieved in the next two years. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Elon Musk have made public statements declaring clear roadmaps to achieve AGI; regardless of who gets there first, time will decide whether they are a hero or the destroyers of worlds. Potential evolution of use cases: Friend and foe Alongside positive innovations, AI is facilitating amoral actors. LLMs and AI agents are being used to assist hacking. LLMs get jailbroken to produce malware and are being used for targeted scamming, such as faking voices in phone calls to incite money transfers from unsuspecting victims. An open-sourced AI Agent can be used by malicious actors for targeted scams, tasked with finding, tracking, tracing, and infiltrating a target—never ending until it achieves its goal. One key vulnerability on the horizon lies in the potential for AGI to break cryptographic encryptions. Bitcoin ( BTC ) encryption hacking is already a growing market, but is currently limited to the realm of quantum computing , which has an incredibly high barrier to entry—it requires extreme assets, resources, and technical capabilities that the average hacker does not possess. Crypto encryption hacking has been limited to a small handful of individuals who are legally paying for the services of quantum computing firms to unlock their wallets and recover funds for a hefty finder’s fee. Encryption hacking will not always be bound to the limits of quantum computing. AGI presents much lower barriers to entry and will leverage technology that man has not even yet discovered. AI + bad actors = death of crypto Once AI has advanced to the point where it can hack encryption, the level of criminals using this tool will dramatically increase. Usage will extend well beyond innocent crypto investors trying to recover funds. Hackers will use AI agents sufficiently advanced to target and exploit these weaknesses in our financial systems. Particularly as there are many amoral groups that lack quantum computing skills, actively interested in the weaponisation of AI, for example, the North Korean Lazarus Group, infamous for financial hacks , poses a real danger. We are looking at far more devastating effects than just scams and theft. North Korea will use it as a digital weapon, destroying existing financial systems. Beyond the weaponisation of AI by unfriendly states and actors lies the potential for AGI to go rogue from its creators. Once this happens, one of the first aspects after decentralizing itself, through infiltrating digital networks to become untraceable to avoid being switched off, will be to gather financial resources. The most likely target is the financial markets, specifically crypto. It would try to access digital capital by tracking high-frequency traders, forging accounts, and hacking online bank accounts. It would also break encryption methods for Bitcoin and all major cryptocurrencies. In the blink of an eye, it will be able to hack every single wallet that has ever existed and immediately secure the assets by selling them on the chain for gold, bonds, and fiat currencies, all before any centralised authority could respond. If an AI can crack all the private keys for crypto wallets, why would it not do so within minutes, stealing and selling all of the Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and then diversifying into other assets? It would, and it will. Any hope for crypto (and humankind)? Without proactive counter-strategies, AGI could dismantle cryptocurrencies and very quickly take control of all human finances. As a complex, non-deterministic system, AGI is a technology where the safety rails imposed by governments are most needed; managing these risks requires exceptional cooperation and sophistication across many actors and institutions. Yet this is the first time a world-changing technology has not been spearheaded by the government, but instead by private corporations. From the Manhattan Project to microprocessors, the internet, GPS, and digital cameras, these are all technologies that originated from government-run projects for defense, which were subsequently commercialized for consumers (except for the bomb). Silicon Valley is at the forefront of AI, placing us in a unique position in history where the scale and speed of distribution, versus government oversight, may not be sufficient to prevent major negative impacts. AI will transform society, but once AI proves extremely smart and capable, there will be little to stop the ‘wrong hands’ from developing harmful AI tools. AGI starts a countdown timer until it breaks free from its creator’s chains and moves into the real world. The risks are not exclusive to financial markets, but apply to the whole digital landscape, IoT devices, electrical grids, and so much more. Crypto is but a means to an end for AI, a means to gather wealth. Crypto is purely the financial vessel for the worst-case scenario to unfold.

2025-06-08T09:42:43,"Viral Crypto Presale Attracts $4 Million in Investment, Nexchain Could Be the Next 10x Crypto","As the crypto market revives heading into 2025, presale projects with real-world utility are gaining traction. Investors who once jumped on meme coins are now redirecting their focus to projects showing tangible infrastructure, scalability, and longevity. Nexchain stands out in this trend. The AI-powered Layer-1 blockchain has already raised $4 million in its ongoing Stage 17 presale, catching the attention of serious crypto backers. Unlike hype coins that lack sustainable models, Nexchain is building a real ecosystem for cross-industry blockchain adoption. Its combination of scalability, decentralization, and smart automation makes it a strong contender for one of the best crypto presales of the year. Nexchain Is the Future Layer-1 Blockchain You Can Buy Early Nexchain isn’t just promising innovation, it’s already delivering features that many other chains can’t yet match. At the core of its offering is a 10% daily gas fee revenue share distributed automatically to all token holders who use non-custodial wallets. This model turns passive holding into active earning, giving NEX tokens real-world yield from network activity rather than speculative rewards. With its hybrid AI + Proof-of-Stake consensus, Nexchain reaches over 400,000 TPS, making it one of the fastest blockchains available today. The chain supports smart contracts that can access real-time AI models and execute logic based on live data. This makes it ideal for powering AI applications across DeFi, supply chains, and decentralized healthcare. The project has just entered Stage 17 with a presale price of $0.066, setting up early adopters for a potential 455% return once it lists at $0.30. With $4 million already raised and support for BTC, SOL, and TRX as payment options, investor confidence is clearly high. New upgrades to the Nexchain dashboard, an upcoming testnet launch, and a brewing airdrop campaign all point to active development and expanding utility. This isn’t just another presale — it’s a real blockchain network preparing to go live. For those ready to be early in a project that mixes tech-first design with long-term earning potential, Nexchain might be the most promising crypto ICO to watch this June. Why Nexchain May Be 2025’s Best Crypto Presale to Buy Crypto narratives come and go, but infrastructure projects with working tech always rise to the top. Nexchain brings together speed, smart revenue-sharing, and real AI functionality in one blockchain. That’s rare in today’s presale environment. The NEX token is more than a speculative play. It provides exposure to daily earnings, cross-chain utility, and access to a decentralized future where AI isn’t just a buzzword — it’s baked into the core. For anyone looking to position early in the next big thing, Nexchain offers a serious value proposition. And with the presale clock ticking, the best time to enter might be now.

2025-06-08T09:30:11,"Ethereum Head & Shoulders Pattern Breakdown: Can Bulls Reclaim Control?","Ethereum’s recent price action on the 4-hour chart has led to the formation of a classic Head and Shoulders pattern that opens up the possibility of a deeper correction. After a relatively stable period around the $2,500 zone, Ethereum broke below a neckline support level as last week drew to a close. This raises the question of whether a bearish continuation is already in motion for the Ethereum price or if bulls still have a shot at regaining momentum in the new week. Related Reading: Elon Musk ‘Will Do Anything’ To Make XRP King, Tech Mogul Says Head & Shoulders Pattern Confirmed After Breakdown Below $2,480 The Head and Shoulders pattern, one of the most recognizable reversal formations in technical analysis, is now clearly visible on Ethereum’s 4-hour candlestick chart. This chart and the technical outlook were first shared on the TradingView platform by crypto analyst MelikaTrader94. The structure includes a left shoulder, a prominent head peaking above $2,700, and a right shoulder that topped near $2,650. The neckline, drawn around $2,480, was breached during Ethereum’s recent pullback to $2,380. This, in turn, shifted the short-term outlook toward the bearish side. After the break, Ethereum attempted to reclaim lost ground and is currently retesting the neckline area. This retest around $2,500 is significant, as a failure to push back above this level significantly would likely validate the bearish setup and cause the Ethereum price to reverse downwards toward the next support zone. According to the outlook from analyst MelikaTrader94, the price target from this Head and Shoulders breakdown before any notable rebound upward can occur lies between $2,200 and $2,250. Chart Image From TradingView: MelikaTrader94 Bulls Must Reclaim $2,650 To Invalidate Bearish Setup A confluence of factors supports the $2,200 region as a likely landing zone. Not only is this level consistent with the measured move of the Head and Shoulders pattern, but it also aligns with an order block on May 9 during Ethereum’s rally above $2,000 at the time. This adds further technical relevance to the $2,200 to $2,250 range acting as a support zone. However, the situation is not fully bearish yet. The path forward is clear but narrow for Ethereum bulls. The first step to invalidate the bearish setup is to reclaim the neckline around $2,500 decisively. Beyond that, breaking back above the right shoulder level around $2,650 would invalidate the Head and Shoulders pattern, and another pattern will most likely come into play.

Analyst Highlights The Trigger A successful bullish reclaim would not only nullify the bearish pattern but could also revive sentiment for another retest of the $2,700 to $2,800 zone, which corresponds to the peak of the head in the recently formed pattern. Until such a recovery occurs, the Ethereum price can quickly reverse downwards at any time. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,510.

2025-06-08T09:30:00,"Treasuries are stacking Bitcoin: PR gimmick or solid strategy?","As Bitcoin continues its rise into mainstream finance, a growing number of public companies are adding the cryptocurrency to their treasuries — but not without controversy. While firms like MicroStrategy and Metaplanet are going all-in on Bitcoin ( BTC ) accumulation, others are cautiously experimenting, often as a hedge against inflation, rising interest rates, and fiat debasement. Yet critics warn that many of these companies are financially shaky, using the coin more as a speculative lifeline than a strategic asset. Analysts are split between seeing this trend as forward-thinking financial engineering or a “dumpster fire.” The rise of corporate Bitcoin treasuries reflects both the promise and peril of crypto’s expanding influence in global capital markets. According to BitBo , as of June 6, over 70 public companies were holding Bitcoin. It’s understood that companies like Strategy and Metaplanet are fully dedicated to accumulation. However, some other corporations are dipping their toes into Bitcoin stacking while continuing to work in a different sphere. Serious question: How many of these random companies stacking BTC on their balance sheet are just doing it for the PR? — Nic (@nicrypto) June 5, 2025 ‘Dumpster fire in the making’ Journalist and analyst Sean Williams expressed his concerns over the possible failure of the Bitcoin treasury companies, citing the lack of innovation and operational success as the drivers of the potential bust. He called the BTC treasury hype a “dumpster fire in the making.” He pointed out that many companies resorting to launching a BTC treasury are not profitable in the first place, so they try to make quick money out of crypto volatility. This emphasizes their weaknesses. Strategy’s stock performance was one of the worst in February 2025. He named several instances when the BTC price saw significant downfalls as an example of the potential risk for such companies. On top of that, Williams sees the scarcity and 21 million hard cap narratives as “mythical” due to the potential possibility of changing the BTC limit. Technically, it’s not impossible. When BlackRock outlined such a possibility in the company’s educational animation, the reaction from Bitcoin maximalists was antagonistic. Coin Bureau founder Nic Puckrin on X expressed doubts that the “random” companies launching Bitcoin treasuries won’t sell their BTC in the bear market. Thus, he brings up these companies’ alleged superficial engagement in Bitcoin and warns about the potential harm to the crypto market.

While some veterans could get annoyed by seeing their favorite crypto gets “appropriated” by the new players with money, the reasons for adopting corporate Bitcoin treasuries have strong macroeconomic grounds. In an in-depth study , Fidelity analysts note that the last five years saw an increase in publicly traded companies that allocate part of their capital in Bitcoin, which is seen as a hedge against increasing fiscal deficits, fiat currency debasement, and risks associated with geopolitical turbulence. Fidelity emphasizes that this approach is unorthodox for big companies, as in previous decades, they held their funds in low-risk assets, such as bank deposits or treasury bills. According to Fidelity, the growing economic uncertainty undermined trust in traditional strategies. Corporate treasuries’ need for uncorrelated capital grew in the 2020s as interest rates hit high, reducing liquidity and cash flows. However, if the interest rate drops, the yields of companies having substantial reserves of traditional funds will also go down. The study calls the response to COVID-19 “unprecedented” as the cumulative stimulus payments of the biggest economies amounted to $10 trillion, which is three times higher than during the 2008 crisis period. Inflation rates surged, causing a decline in corporate treasuries’ purchasing power. These factors made many investors look for new solutions, and soon many, including public companies, saw a solution in Bitcoin. Given that the regulations in the EU and the U.S. have been Bitcoin-friendly, investors started to accumulate digital assets with more confidence. The study mentions such regulations including: The Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval of Bitcoin ETFs The EU’s MiCA framework adoption The Financial Accounting Standards Board’s rule change from 2023, which allowed Bitcoin holding companies to account for and represent value in their financial statements more precisely. Considering the ascending Bitcoin price, it made companies’ balance sheets look stronger. As Bitcoin has been resistant to demand shocks and could serve as a financial cushion in the long run, it promised benefits for companies adding the coin to their balance sheets. According to Fidelity, Bitcoin can help companies survive the monetary debasement policy of central banks due to its verifiable scarcity. Analysts generally note that Bitcoin’s long-term price appreciation was one of the main reasons for its popularity among corporations. The study names the companies pioneering allocation: The Block, MicroStrategy, Stone Ridge Holdings Group, and Selmer Scientific. ‘Crash test’ FOMO and game theory are often mentioned when people discuss reserves. These reserves cut the live liquidity, increasing an asset’s deficit on the markets while not necessarily pumping the price (as people quickly got used to “bullish” announcements). The trend is pretty young, and it needs to undergo a crash test so we can see if the companies stacking bitcoins are not the “tourists.” You might also like: BlackRock nears Satoshi Nakamoto in Bitcoin, tops Strategy and Binance",crypto_news,https://crypto.news/treasuries-stacking-bitcoin-gimmick-solid-strategy/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Follow-up|BlackRock|education|Fidelity Investments|MicroStrategy",cryptocompare

It’s now asking the public to share thoughts on whether the ETF can help stop fraud and manipulation. Litecoin price prediction June 2025 Litecoin’s price shows signs of bullish moves as it has been surging toward $100. However, as BTC’s price aims for a hold above the $110K mark in June, Litecoin’s price intends to end this month on a bullish note.
