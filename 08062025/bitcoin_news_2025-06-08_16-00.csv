Pseudonymous analyst Pentoshi tells his 866,100 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin‚Äôs weekly chart shows that BTC demand is significantly outpacing supply, resulting to higher prices. The trader says he seeing ‚Äúinsatiable‚Äù demand for Bitcoin from firms in the traditional finance (TradFi) world, leading him to believe that bullish continuation is on the table for BTC. ‚ÄúDemand > supply A picture is worth 1,000 words Feel like we see around $120,000 this month.‚Äù Source: Pentoshi/X The analyst also tells his followers to remain patient and have a long-term outlook on the crypto king. ‚ÄúEveryday: ‚ÄòIf there‚Äôs billions of dollars flowing into BTC, why is it not going up?‚Äô My brother in Christ, Zoom out. It‚Äôs going to get there, just maybe not always at the speed you want.‚Äù At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $105,536. Looking at the broader crypto market, Pentoshi says a new bubble is forming in the space. ‚ÄúLooks like all the money is going to be made in crypto companies doing IPOs (initial public offering) at wild valuations Deeper pockets, more liquidity, higher valuations Another bubble is brewing, another bubble to chase.‚Äù Pentoshi‚Äôs bubble call comes after shares of the stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) meteorically rose on the first day of trading.

2025-06-08T13:24:10,"Here‚Äôs when Solana will reach $620, according to analyst","Solana ( SOL ) could be poised to climb as high as $620 in the coming months, according to a trading analyst who also sees the potential for the DeFi asset to rally all the way to $1,000. This bullish outlook comes as SOL recovers from a dip on June 6, when it touched the weekly low of $141. As of press time, the token was trading at $149.52, down 1.5% over the past 24 hours. SOL one-week price chart. Source: Finbold Solana is facing short-term bearish pressure, with the price lingering below the 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $161 and the 200-day SMA at $164.19. A decisive break above the 200-day SMA could confirm a trend reversal and ignite renewed bullish momentum. The 14-day relative strength index ( RSI ) is 40.14, indicating mild bearish pressure without entering oversold territory. SOL‚Äôs path to $620 From a technical standpoint, analyst Master Ananda shared a TradingView post on June 6 outlining a potential path for SOL to reach $620, with a minimum target of $420 and an extended high of $1,020. After a roughly 24% correction from $188 to $141, Ananda believes the pullback phase may be over. In this case, the cryptocurrency is developing a higher low pattern, which suggests the start of a new upward trend. SOL price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Meanwhile, key Fibonacci extension levels support this projection: $420 at the 1.618 level, $620 at the 2.618 level, and $1,021 at the 4.618 level. According to the forecast, the digital asset could hit the $620 mark by January 2026, a 316% increase from its current price. If this target is reached, Solana‚Äôs market cap could balloon to approximately $325 billion, potentially ranking it second behind Bitcoin ( BTC ), assuming minimal growth from Ethereum ( ETH ) during the same period. Finally, the trading expert cautioned against shorting during a bullish trend, advising instead to wait for support levels before entering long positions. Solana fundamentals Meanwhile, Solana‚Äôs broader ecosystem continues to show notable momentum. Market attention is focused on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission‚Äôs (SEC) decision regarding spot SOL exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) applications. The odds of approval in 2025 have surged to over 80% despite the SEC delaying its decision on proposals from 21Shares, Bitwise, VanEck, and Canary Capital. On the flip side, some skepticism remains. Banking giant Standard Chartered questioned Solana‚Äôs long-term sustainability in late May, warning in a report that the network risks becoming a ‚Äúone-trick pony‚Äù dominated by memecoin creation and trading. For starters, Solana‚Äôs recent momentum was driven mainly by meme coin activity on the network.

The idea, first sparked by crypto trader Vladcoin, is now being seen as a real possibility by Bloomberg‚Äôs senior ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas. He believes there‚Äôs a strong chance we could see this unique fund by 2026. ETF Analyst Sees a Real Chance In response to Vladcoin‚Äôs idea of having an ETF that buys and sells meme coins based on how well they perform, buying the promising ones and selling off the weaker ones. Bloomberg‚Äôs senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said there‚Äôs a ‚Äúreally good chance‚Äù that an actively managed meme coin ETF could exist in the future. However, he added that it would probably take some time to happen. Really good chance this exists at some point. First we‚Äôll get slew of active crypto ETFs (eta Winter 2025). Active meme coin-only likely 2026 tho. The return dispersion (and lack of sell side coverage) ripe for active. Could produce next star manager. Who knows. https://t.co/9CcEc4xmev ‚Äî Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) June 7, 2025 He expects to see many active crypto ETFs launch by winter 2025, but a meme coin-only active ETF is more likely to come around 2026. Meanwhile, polygon-based prediction market Polymarket predicts that Dogecoin ETF will see approval by the end of 2025 with a probability of 44% . No Meme Coin ETFs Yet While we don‚Äôt have a meme coin-only ETF yet, the idea isn‚Äôt completely out of the blue. Several big asset managers have already launched or filed for spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, including BlackRock, Fidelity, and VanEck. These funds have been very popular, bringing in billions of dollars in assets within months. Some smaller players have also filed for ‚Äúcrypto basket‚Äù ETFs that invest in a mix of digital assets, but so far, no one has filed for a meme coin-only ETF. Still, the idea is gaining interest. Why Meme Coins? Eric believes that meme coins could be perfect for active management. Meme coins like Dogecoin , Shiba Inu, and Pepe are known for their huge price swings and hype-driven moves. Many don‚Äôt have traditional research or clear fundamentals, which makes it hard to know which ones will survive. Eric also hinted that if this kind of ETF comes to life, it could create a new star in the investing world.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/meme-coin-etfs-to-be-launched-by-2026-says-senior-bloomberg-analyst/,"BTC|DOGE|ETH|SHIB|TRADING","News",cryptocompare

Japan just revamped its Payment Services Act to be ‚Äòcrypto-friendly,‚Äô opening the door for more institutional and mainstream adoption across Asia. In Dubai, tokenized real estate pushed sales past $18B in May ‚Äì proof that on‚Äëchain ownership of physical assets is no longer science fiction. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is staging another bull run, and altcoin investors are itching to catch the next wave. Let‚Äôs look at the three of the best altcoins in presale right now ‚Äì each uniquely positioned to benefit from crypto-friendly regulation in Asia and real-world tokenization trends. Why Now is a Golden Moment Crypto is having a global moment ‚Äì and it‚Äôs not just about price charts anymore. In Asia, Japan just revised its Payment Services Act , tightening oversight while making space for crypto firms to register and operate more easily. It‚Äôs a clear sign that regulators are shifting from resistance to integration. This move could unlock a wave of institutional adoption across Asia, one of the largest and fastest-growing crypto markets in the world. Meanwhile, in the Middle East, Dubai is setting records. The city saw over $18B in real estate sales in May alone, fueled in part by the rapid rise of tokenized property. Instead of paperwork and middlemen, buyers can now invest using blockchain-based tokens ‚Äì secure, traceable, and fast. These two trends, regulatory clarity and real-world use cases, are no longer hypothetical. They‚Äôre happening now. And they‚Äôre fueling demand for presale projects that don‚Äôt just promise innovation ‚Äì they‚Äôre built for it. 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) ‚Äì Terraforming Solana with Layer‚Äë2 Power With the world turning to scalable crypto infrastructure, Solaxy ($SOLX) is stepping up as the first-ever Layer‚Äë2 built on Solana, aiming to lead the next phase of blockchain evolution. Designed to neutralize Solana‚Äôs most pressing issues like network congestion, failed transactions, and scaling headaches, Solaxy also amplifies everything Solana does best. Including lightning speed and rock-bottom fees. It‚Äôs not just a patch ‚Äì it‚Äôs a performance upgrade. But Solaxy doesn‚Äôt stop at Solana. With its native token $SOLX set to go multichain on both Ethereum and Solana, it bridges two of the biggest blockchain ecosystems. That means access to Ethereum‚Äôs deep DeFi liquidity and Solana‚Äôs meme-coin explosion ‚Äì all from one token. It‚Äôs no wonder the presale has already raised over $45.4M. But right now, you can still buy $SOLX for just $0.001748 per token. Solaxy also democratizes high-frequency meme coin trading, giving regular users tools once reserved for sniper bots. With only 8 days left in the presale, this is the final boarding call for what could be one of the best altcoins of the year. 2. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) ‚Äì Real‚ÄëWorld Creator Economy Tokenization As real-world tokenization gains ground, SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) is stepping into the spotlight as the first AI agent for content creation and premium Web3 platform. Designed for influencers, creators, and their fans, SUBBD transforms the traditional creator economy by removing middlemen and putting monetization directly into the hands of its users. At the time of writing, $SUBBD is in presale at $0.0556 and has already raised over $625K. Here‚Äôs how it works: creators can use AI tools to automate chats, upsell premium content, and even delegate video editing. Fans can buy tokens to unlock gated content, tip creators, or even interact with AI-generated avatars approved by the original influencers themselves. With over 250M followers across the platform and its affiliated brands, $SUBBD already has the reach to take off fast. Price forecasts suggest $SUBBD could reach between $0.08 and $0.30 in 2025 ‚Äì making it a standout among the new crypto projects with real-world use and upside. 3. Qubetics ($TICS) ‚Äì Tokenizing Real-World Assets at Scale Qubetics ($TICS) enters the scene as a full-fledged Layer‚Äë1 blockchain built around real-world asset tokenization. It enables individuals, institutions, and businesses to digitize high-value assets, like real estate, fine art, and private equity, and trade them seamlessly on-chain through a decentralized, non‚Äëcustodial marketplace. The platform connects Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana ecosystems, offering cross-chain access, transparency, and global reach ‚Äì all while complying with local regulations. The crypto presale is already turning heads: $TICS is currently trading at $0.33709673, and over $17.8M has been raised so far ‚Äì proof there‚Äôs serious institutional and retail interest. With 38.5‚ÄØ% of the total supply allocated for presale, the launch is both well-funded and structured. Qubetics stands out by reducing friction in real-world asset trading: instant settlements, low fees, and regulatory compliance make it easy to fractionalize expensive assets. In a world where tokenization is moving from theory to practice, Qubetics offers a bridge between traditional assets and decentralized finance. Global Shifts, Local Gains: 3 Crypto Presales to Watch From Japan‚Äôs crypto-friendly reforms to Dubai‚Äôs tokenized real estate surge, adoption is accelerating. Projects like Solaxy , SUBBD Token , and Qubetics are built for this moment ‚Äì bridging regulation, utility, and innovation.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) was trading at $105,550 on Sunday, June 8, up by 5% from its lowest point last week. It remains 5.75% below its highest point this year. Bitcoin has wavered recently because of investor profit-taking . In May, its price surged to a record high of $111,900, a 50% surge from the lowest level in April. BTC also wavered as data pointed to outflows from exchange-traded funds. SoSoValue data shows that these ETFs shed $128 million last week after shedding $157 million a week earlier. It was the first back-to-back weekly outflows since April. Further data shows that sentiment among crypto investors has turned neutral this month. The closely-watched fear and greed index has dropped to the neutral point of 56. Bitcoin has also wavered after reports emerged that China was considering selling its seized coins. Data shows that it holds 190,000 coins worth over $20 billion.

Bitcoin price technical analysis BTC price chart | Source: crypto.news The other Bitcoin catalyst is its solid technicals. The daily chart shows that it has slowly formed a cup-and-handle pattern and is completing the handle section. Bitcoin has also remained above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, which provide substantial support. It has also remained above the major S/R pivot point of the Murrey Math Lines tool.

According to reports, the investment platform masquerades as InnBucks Investment, luring innocent people into depositing their funds using Ecocash, which is moved to the fake trading platform. According to local reports, the platform promises residents in Zimbabwe the opportunity to make profits from Bitcoin trading, agreeing to trade the asset on their behalf. They are asked to register accounts on the Amexcyp Market platform using their specialized link. ‚ÄúHere is an opportunity to make x3 of your investment without any hidden fees or withdrawal fees 100% safe and secure.

Trade on InnBucks investment today!‚Äù another post read. However, it was discovered that the platform had no connections to InnBucks, with the platform releasing a post on its Facebook page warning its users. ‚ÄúStay vigilant, stay safe. Never share your InnBucks PIN, OTP, or ID number with anyone. InnBucks does not carry out Investment schemes, always verify the authenticity of pages through our official channels‚Äîcall us on 569 or message us on our official social media platforms. Be on the lookout for fake pages and scammers like the ones below,‚Äù InnBucks posted, attaching some of the fake platform‚Äôs posts. According to investigations carried out by Bulawayo24 , the fake trading platform‚Äôs posts have a WhatsApp number attached, with the number belonging to an agent called Michelle Chiunda, claiming she is from InnBucks Investment on Facebook. The attached number only connects through WhatsApp and a call is always received by a party that is oblivious to either the trading investment platform or its WhatsApp account. Upon enquiry, ‚ÄúChiunda‚Äù mentioned that the WhatsApp number was registered in her sister‚Äôs name, claiming the name, Katanda, which was attached to the number, is also her surname. Meanwhile, upon calling the number, it was answered by a woman who seemed unaware that her number was being used to lure people into InnBucks Investment on Facebook, pointing to the fact that the number might have been hacked. Fake investment officer reveals operations Confirming the advertisement made on Facebook, Chiunda mentioned that if a client in Zimbabwe invests $100 on the platform, the company will take charge of the trading on their behalf using their auto-electronic mining machine. This machine is 100% guaranteed for locking all incoming profit, it also keeps the trade signal stable to prevent any negative effect from MARKET-CAP,‚Äù she said. She added that the trade takes 24 hours to complete, and once it is done, the user is guaranteed X10 of their investment, while the company keeps the remaining X3 part of the profit. Chiunda said that users in Zimbabwe can receive their profit from any account, highlighting that they pay to Ecocash, Innbucks, or Mukuru. She mentioned that as soon as a user signifies their intention to invest, a link is sent to them where they can register. For a user in Zimbabwe to register on the trading platform, they must send their details to Chiunda to help them register or click on the amexcypmarket link that she sends to them. After registration, the user is expected to send a screenshot of the interface to her before they proceed with their initial investment starting from $50. She also claimed that the platform is in association with InnBucks, a party that has already distanced itself from the scam, and indicated that the authorities have been alerted.

2025-06-08T12:00:00,"Bitcoin: Tweezer Bottom Indicates A Reversal Is Possible (Technical Analysis)","Summary Bitcoin's recent chart appears to show a textbook tweezer bottom, signaling a likely bullish reversal after its recent downtrend. If Bitcoin continues this reversal of sentiment, I expect a move higher and a potential test of prior highs in the near term. A confirmed tweezer bottom would mark strong buyer intervention and a probable shift in market sentiment toward new highs this summer. If $100K fails to hold, the bullish thesis is invalidated; price action this week should confirm whether a sustained reversal is underway. Recent price action in Bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) chart appears to show a textbook tweezer bottom. A tweezer bottom is a bullish reversal candlestick pattern that sometimes appears at the end of a downtrend. If this is the case, Bitcoin may be ready to make a reversal and potentially break out to new highs in the near term. For this reason, so long as Bitcoin stays above its June 6th close, and does not breach the apparent bottom it made on June 5th and 6th, Bitcoin appears ready to reverse course, move higher, and test upside resistance in the near term. Tweezer bottoms are characterized by two consecutive candlesticks that share the same low price, or very close to it, where the first is the same, low price. Here's a breakdown of its key characteristics: The tweezer pattern has to form following a clear downtrend, which Bitcoin was in for the last few weeks, since making an all-time high in the second half of May. Recent Bitcoin Candlestick Chart (Finviz, with red notations by Zvi Bar) The tweezer bottom starts with a relatively large bearish candle that would generally indicate a continuation of selling pressure, or possibly a sizable capitulation. That move is immediately followed by a bullish candle that is usually of similar size, but what matters most is that its low point is in line with the prior bearish candle. This indicates that despite initial selling pressure evidenced by the bearish move, buyers stepped in at the same price point and prevented further declines before moving the price higher. These consecutive matching lows are likely to mark a strong level of support that implies sellers attempted to push price lower, and that this push lower was rejected. As a result, a tweezer bottom represents a probable reversal of the recent trend down, and a move higher in the near term. If this most recent action is indeed a tweezer bottom, a change in market sentiment through the next few weeks is probable. 1-Year Bitcoin Candlestick Chart (Finviz with red notes by Zvi Bar) It is apparent that a reasonable level of seller exhaustion occurred. Bitcoin had downward momentum since making a top in the middle of May, and faced downward pressure since failing to break through apparent resistance around $111,000, or around its all-time high. The downward momentum within the first bearish candle of the tweezer bottom then faced significant opposition at just above $100,000, and sellers were unable to push Bitcoin lower. The subsequent bullish candle indicates and/or confirms buyer intervention. Bouncing off the same low demonstrates that buyers consistently and likely aggressively stepped in at that level, absorbing selling pressure and reversing price direction. This indicates a return of buying interest and a potential shift in market sentiment. The matching lows also create a strong level of support that appears likely here to signify a near term price floor from which Bitcoin could jump-start a recovery. The confirmation of whether the move last week was a tweezer bottom comes from the subsequent price action. A sustained move higher after the apparent formation validates a reversal. Similarly, the tweezer bottom‚Äôs support should also subsequently act as support on another move downward, and become a critical level where buyers must successfully defend against further price depreciation, or a continuation and potential acceleration of the pre-existing downtrend becomes exceedingly probable. If Bitcoin has, in fact, formed a tweezer bottom, this may represent a significant development for sentiment around Bitcoin and the potential for it to make new highs this summer, and possibly even before summer‚Äôs technical start. Risk While this pattern may suggest that a critical low was established as support, and that selling pressure has waned, it is also possible that the level of support created by the apparent tweezer bottom shall not hold. It could be the case that the second candle‚Äôs bullish appearance was due to other temporary forces, such as Friday's weekly options expiration or the capricious influences of recent government actions. Other influences would include changes to interest rates, dollar weakness, and general sentiment towards competing safe haven and alternative assets. In either case, it should be expected that market activity this week will confirm whether this is, in fact, a tweezer bottom, and continued upside momentum should be expected, or if this was a temporary respite to be followed by further declines. Conclusion I believe it is highly likely that Bitcoin just made a tweezer bottom that will act as a strong level of support, and it is likely that Bitcoin is at the start of a reversal that will test its prior high. If Bitcoin cannot hold $100K, it would invalidate this theory and indicate continued selling pressure. If Bitcoin confirms the tweezer bottom in the coming days, it is also reasonably likely that Bitcoin can make a new high in the near term, and potentially move considerably higher.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4793234-bitcoin-tweezer-bottom-indicates-a-reversal-is-possible-technical-analysis?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING","BTC-USD",cryptocompare

2025-06-08T11:39:48,"Bitcoin at the Brink: Double Top or $150K Moonshot, What‚Äôs Next?","Bitcoin is currently trading around $105,500, up a modest 1.1% in 24 hours, after a volatile week that saw prices swing between $100,400 and $106,500. While short-term price action appears calm, with the king cryptocurrency locked in a narrow 24-hour range of $103,500 to $105,800, underlying signals hint at seismic moves ahead. And with the asset now 6.2% down from its May 22 all-time high, the crypto community is divided: double top or liftoff? Double Top D√©j√† Vu? Pseudonymous analyst Cryptowizard took to X on June 7 with a chart comparison between Bitcoin‚Äôs current structure and the infamous 2021 double top. ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äôs price action is starting to look familiar,‚Äô‚Äù they wrote. ‚ÄúJust like in 2021, we‚Äôre seeing a potential double top formation plays out. Are we setting up for a retrace or $150K next?‚Äù That question has ignited debate across the community. Investor Trade Pro isn‚Äôt buying the bearish narrative. ‚ÄúMake no mistake about these pullbacks. I think they are buying opportunities‚Ä¶ All signs point to strong continuation to new all-time highs,‚Äù they asserted, citing strong on-chain metrics. Backing that bullish case, Gracy Chen of Bitget says the macro picture is playing directly into Bitcoin‚Äôs hands. Trump‚Äôs latest 1% rate cut proposal and over $500 billion in expected U.S. Treasury borrowing by Q4 hint at a liquidity tsunami. ‚ÄúGlobally, monetary easing is no longer a question of if, but when,‚Äù she noted, calling BTC the ultimate hedge in a world increasingly skeptical of fiat stability. ‚ÄúBitcoin was built for these shifts.‚Äù Market watcher Axel Adler Jr. also noted that the 30-day volatility is now ‚Äúhighly compressed,‚Äù a setup that could just be the basis for a substantial market swing. Meanwhile, institutional buying continues to lock up supply. Swan CIO Ben Werkman pointed out that allocators, rather than traders, are driving this cycle, accumulating BTC without intent to sell. ‚Äú62% of Bitcoin hasn‚Äôt moved in over a year,‚Äù noted Swan, suggesting that historic dormancy often precedes liftoff, as was the case in 2016 and 2020. Resistance Ahead? Still, not everyone is convinced the pump is near. According to Glassnode, at this time, the Short-Term Holder Cost Basis sits at just above $97,000 , with crucial thresholds at $83,200 and $114,800. The blockchain analytics firm predicts that a break below $100,000 could ignite another liquidation cascade, especially after Friday‚Äôs $988 million in long liquidations triggered by the very public tiff between U.S. President Donald Trump and his erstwhile political ally, Elon Musk. Even Daan Crypto Trade isn‚Äôt ruling out a deeper retracement. ‚ÄúBelow yesterday‚Äôs lows at ~$100K and I think we‚Äôll keep trending down for another 1‚Äì2 weeks,‚Äù he posted on X, pointing to BTC‚Äôs weakening correlation with stocks and a sluggish bounce from recent lows.

BTC is reaffirming their status as the best cryptocurrencies to invest in during this cycle. But as blue-chip coins steady the market, fresh capital is rotating into high-potential, new crypto Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , currently trading under $1 and drawing attention for its ambitious DeFi roadmap and projected 44x ROI potential. Over 11,700 investors own the token and has raised funds worth over $10.1 million. A lot of investors are investing at $0.03 since the next increase of 16.67%, to $0.035, is about to happen. Investors joining now are expecting a 100% return once the project goes live at a price of $0.06. MUTM is quickly becoming one of the best cryptos to buy now, especially for those eyeing the next big cryptocurrency before the next breakout. Bitcoin and Ethereum Maintain Momentum Amid Market Optimism The current price of Bitcoin (BTC) is $105,366 which is slightly higher by 0.02%. Ever since hitting its May low of $93,232, Bitcoin has rebounded and analysts say the $106,000‚Äì$106,500 range will act as strong resistance for the cryptocurrency. While writing, Ethereum (ETH) is trading above $2,628.42, adding around 0.52%. The coin is now toughing it out at a critical stage of $2,725, where it has met with challenges while progressing this week. Buying these cryptos right now is considered smart, because they open many opportunities for investors. Crypto investors are now paying more attention to upcoming altcoins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as high-potential investments. Mutuum Finance Presale Surges as Investor Interest Grows MUTM utilizes a two-way lending model that has made the project take center stage as far as speedy adoption by users is concerned. More than 11,700 investors have invested $10.1 million in the presale pointing to the success of the project. MUTM token will cost $0.035 in Phase 6 which means its price is set to appreciate by 16.67%. That presents investors with an opportunity for high returns. Through both market demand and strong lending approaches, Mutuum Finance is an intriguing DeFi project. Mutuum Finance‚Äôs Lending Platform Gains Trust as Certik Audit Wraps Up The Mutuum system brings together both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. With P2C, individuals can gain rewards from USDT pools and automated smart contracts and P2P gives them full power to handle direct cryptocurrency payments. Because of these factors, trading in DeFi has become safer, more convenient and more attractive for high-yield investors. Mutuum Finance is building a fully collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin to be issued on the Ethereum network. Its overcollateralized design ensures long-term price stability, avoiding the collapse risks that have affected algorithmic stablecoins. The platform is powered by open-source smart contracts that have now been officially audited and certified safe by Certik, providing a strong foundation for user trust and paving the way for institutional adoption. Rewarding Early Investors and Growing the Community Mutuum Finance is encouraging people to join by offering attractive rewards to early investors. Ten lucky participants in the ongoing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) $100,000 giveaway will be rewarded with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. Since Bitcoin and Ethereum have passed $105,000 and $2,000, respectively, investors believe in their continued growth. Along with this, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining attention after raising over $10.1 million from more than 11,700 participants in its presale. MUTM is currently $0.03 and it is forecasted to go up 16.67% very soon, so buying it now could potentially earn potential investors double their initial investment by purchasing at its initial offering of $0.03. Being able to lend money using a new system and providing a stablecoin makes it attractive in the world of DeFi. Thanks to these early supports and increasing appreciation, MUTM proves itself to be valued as much as BTC and ETH.

2025-06-08T10:45:50,"Bitcoin Eyes Breakout as Traders Watch Key Levels","Bitcoin held firm near $105,500 on June 8, signaling that its recent corrective phase may be nearing an end. The move followed a dip to $100,500 on June 5, but BTC/USD has since staged a steady recovery, nearing its weekly open. Bullish Momentum Reappears Popular analyst Rekt Capital noted signs of strength on the daily chart. ‚ÄúOn the Daily timeframe, Bitcoin is showcasing signs of breaking its two-week Downtrend‚Ä¶ while also turning it into support earlier today,‚Äù he said on X. He added that a daily close and retest around $106,600 would solidify a bullish continuation. Other traders, like SuperBro, also pointed to Bitcoin closing above its 10-day simple moving average as a positive sign. That metric, according to SuperBro, helps invalidate bearish scenarios. Liquidity Signals Suggest Imminent Volatility Trader Cas Abbe examined order book liquidity and observed building pressure both above and below spot price. He suggested this setup could lead to a ‚Äúmagnet-style‚Äù price move. ‚ÄúBTC liquidation cluster is now signalling an upside move,‚Äù he said. Abbe noted that a 10% price increase could liquidate $15.11 billion in shorts, while a 10% drop would impact $9.58 billion in longs. He also pointed to negative funding rates as evidence of mounting short positions. ‚ÄúI think BTC big move is coming next week, possibly pushing it above $109K‚Äì$110K,‚Äù he predicted. Key Support Levels Remain in Focus Some analysts are still preparing for a possible retest of lower support zones. Trader CrypNuevo said $100,000 remains a strong psychological support. ‚Äú100k is the strongest psychological support‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs the area where I‚Äôm building some longs with easy invalidation below it,‚Äù he explained. Rekt Capital Eyes Weekly Close Importance Rekt Capital also highlighted the importance of Bitcoin holding above $104,400 for a fourth consecutive weekly close. He described the retest following May‚Äôs all-time highs as ‚Äúsuccessful,‚Äù adding further weight to bullish sentiment. With market conditions showing renewed strength, all eyes are now on the next move as Bitcoin sits on the edge of a potential breakout.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/bitcoin-eyes-breakout-as-traders-watch-key-levels/,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|Crypto News Today",cryptocompare

2025-06-08T10:18:17,"As Crypto Press in LATAM Took a Hit, Outset PR Found Where It‚Äôs Still Worth Showing Up in 2025","In 2024, Latin America became the world‚Äôs second-fastest-growing crypto market. From hyperinflation-driven adoption in Argentina to innovation hubs in Brazil, the appetite for crypto is accelerating in the region. But that momentum isn't reflected in media visibility. In Q1 2025, LATAM‚Äôs crypto-covering newsrooms showed signs of collapse. According to data from Outset PR , a boutique agency specializing in data-driven organic campaigns for Web3, nearly 73% of 55 active publishers lost traffic between January and March ‚Äî exposing deep instability in the ecosystem meant to amplify crypto‚Äôs narrative. Specifically: Traffic across the analyzed sites dropped from 94.48 million visits in January to 81.53 million in February ‚Äî a steep 13.71% decline. March brought some recovery, up to 85.59M, but most outlets remained below January levels. The Q1 dip coincided with Bitcoin's 17% price drop and significant losses in altcoins, driven by exchange hacks, meme coin controversies, and tightening U.S. policy signals, alongside a major Google core update in March. Traffic Gainers Exist ‚Äî But There‚Äôs a Catch Only 15 outlets recorded positive traffic growth during Q1. However, many of these aren‚Äôt true crypto-native sources. For example, El Diario and Money Times ‚Äî both drawing millions of visitors month-over-month ‚Äî are general finance or news portals that tend to boost crypto coverage only during market highs, leaving gaps when volatility kicks in. They‚Äôre also less useful for consistent storytelling or long-term Web3 brand building. Crypto-native growth was rare ‚Äî but telling. A few dedicated outlets posted strong percentage gains: DiarioBitcoin: +204.31% CriptoTendencia: +98.86% Cripto247: +36.17% Yet their total reach still lagged far behind generalist publications. Even after these surges, the listed outlets operated in the 100,000‚Äì400,000 monthly visit range, not in the millions. And the cherry on top? Nearly half of Q1‚Äôs gainers averaged fewer than 91,000 monthly visitors. Bitcoin Mexico, Blocknews, and Criptomonedas.eu even sat in the sub-10,000 range, making them suitable for SEO or local targeting ‚Äî but effectively irrelevant for scalable PR or distribution. The Real Crypto Influence Is in the Hands of a Few Sites ‚Äî Even as They Decline Notably, the top crypto-focused outlets saw traffic declines in February, and many didn‚Äôt recover by March. These included: CriptoNoticias Cointelegraph Brasil Livecoins CriptoFacil BitFinanzas Portal do Bitcoin While their grip on attention is no longer stable, their reach remains unmatched. The report reveals a striking concentration: these six sites were the only publishers to surpass 400,000 average monthly visits in Q1 ‚Äî together accounting for 69% of total crypto-native traffic. The mid-tier segment, represented by seven outlets including DiarioBitcoin, CriptoTendencia, and Cripto247, captured just 23% of crypto audiences. The remaining 8% was spread across 24 low-traffic sites, which consistently failed to exceed 110,000 monthly visits. Outset PR highlights that this long-tail fragmentation limits the utility of many ‚Äúfull coverage‚Äù PR packages ‚Äî where legacy media lists include outlets that are not just declining, but becoming invisible. A prime example is CryptoNews Brasil, which lost its LATAM visibility entirely ‚Äî likely due to growing regulatory friction, including domain filtering and stricter rules around betting-related advertising. What Crypto PR Needs in LATAM Now Outset PR‚Äôs findings highlight a fundamental shift: media performance is no longer predictable, and past reputation doesn‚Äôt guarantee present relevance. To build meaningful traction, crypto brands need to evolve their approach. Here‚Äôs what Outset PR recommends. Right moves Wrong moves Diversify across crypto-native outlets with proven stability and/or growth Rely on static media kits or outdated lists ‚Äî focus on your goals and plan accordingly Mix niche crypto and finance portals for layered visibility during bullish cycles Assume high traffic means high crypto engagement ‚Äî vet editorial consistency Track Google algorithm updates and local regulatory changes regularly Expect one or two publishers to carry your campaign ‚Äî scale horizontally across tiers How Outset PR Does It Differently Outset PR doesn‚Äôt pitch blind. It audits the media landscape quarter by quarter, using a proprietary system to map reach, relevance, and algorithmic shifts across the markets. Campaigns are built with live performance data Each media outlet is hand-selected based on audience quality, not just quantity Market timing and platform resilience are factored into publishing decisions This data-driven, boutique model ensures that PR is a strategic asset aligned with your roadmap and resources.
