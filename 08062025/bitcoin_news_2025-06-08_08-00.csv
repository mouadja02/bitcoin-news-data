2025-06-08T04:35:02,"Crypto price prediction: Ravencoin, AB token, Keeta","The crypto market held steady during the weekend as traders focused on the upcoming US inflation data, which will determine the next actions by the Federal Reserve. Bitcoin traded at $105,000, while Ethereum’s price moved to $2,500. This article looks at some of the top trending coins like Ravencoin, AB, and Keeta. Ravencoin price analysis Ravencoin is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency created as a hard fork of Bitcoin. Its main difference with Bitcoin is that it has a supply cap of 21 billion, while Bitcoin has 21 million. RVN price surged recently after Upbit, the biggest South Korean exchange, listed it, giving it access to millions of customers. It moved to a high of $0.0257, the highest point since December last year, and then pulled back to $0.01570. Ravencoin price remains slightly above the key resistance level at $0.01428, the highest swing on May 13. It has also jumped above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a sign that bulls remain in control. Ravencoin price chart Ravencoin token also remains above the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level, while the MACD is pointing upwards. Therefore, the coin will likely continue rising as bulls target the 38.2% retracement point at $0.01912. A drop below the support at $0.0142 will invalidate the bullish outlook. Read more: Ravencoin (RVN) is pumping? Is it about Litecoin ETF speculation? AB price forecast AB is a blockchain project that offers a modular technology that supports fast and secure transactions, smart contract execution, and decentralized governance. The AB token price has jumped recently following its listing on several exchanges like Binance, Bitget, and MEXC. It has also done well as on-chain data shows that its network is starting to gow, albeit from a low base. AB has handled over 1.5 million blocks since inception and 29,792 transactions. It is handling about 2.6k transactions a day, while addresses have risen to 23,6111. However, its network utilization remains at 0.01%, meaning that it needs to supercharge its growth to justify its valuation. The daily chart shows that the AB price bottomed at $0.004084 on May 26 and then bounced back to $0.01040. It has moved slightly above the key resistance level at $0.01. The highest point on May 28. AB token price chart The Relative Strength Index and the MACD indicators have all pointed upwards. Therefore, technicals suggest that the AB token will continue rising as bulls target $0.015. However, AB is a thinly traded token, meaning that it may have extreme moves on some days. Keeta price forecast Keeta is a blockchain network that delivers over 10 million transactions per second. Its goal is to unify the blockchain industry by enabling users to move assets across multiple chains. It also lets users to create tokens that represent real-world assets. The two-hour chart shows that the Keeta token price has done well in the past few days as it moved to a record high of $1.4920, up 262% from its lowest point this year. Keeta token recently moved above the key resistance level at $1.2400, its highest point on June 3. Moving above that level invalidated the double-top pattern that was forming. Keeta price chart It has also retested that level, pointing to more gains, potentially to the psychological point at $2. A drop below the support at $1.2400 will invalidate the bullish Keeta price forecast.

2025-06-08T03:30:16,"Bitcoin Stabilizes At $104,000 Mid-Range As Market Eyes Next Breakout","Bitcoin saw a sharp price dip on Thursday amidst a public fallout between US President Donald Trump and the world’s richest man Elon Musk. The premier cryptocurrency, which had traded steadily within the $104,000–$106,000 range throughout the week, plunged to below $101,000 as tensions escalated between the two influential figures who attacked each other via their personally owned social media platforms i.e. X (formerly Twitter) and Truth Social. Since then, Bitcoin has shown some market resilience climbing back to around $104,000. With another consolidation developing, market analyst Crypto Daan has highlighted the price levels that are critical to the next price breakout. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Largest Net Taker Volume Drop Of 2025 – Traders React To Trump-Elon Clash Beyond $106K Or Below $100K – What’s Next For Bitcoin? The month of May proved largely bullish for Bitcoin as the digital asset surged from around $95,000 to establish a new all-time high near $112,000 marking the resumption of the larger crypto bull market. However, Bitcoin has noted a significant price correction since reaching this peak with market prices pegged around $104,000 on May 31. As seen in the first week of June, Bitcoin had hovered around $106,000 before its most recent price slump on Thursday. Due to this price action, Daan Crypto notes the digital asset is now trading within a price range of $100,000-$106,000, where it comfortably sits at the mid-range around $104,000. The analyst notes that if Bitcoin returns break below the lower range boundary at $100,000, the ongoing price correction could extend for 1-2 weeks. Going by BTC’s stairwell ascent in the past month, potential market support in such a bearish case would lie around $95,000 and $85,000. On the other hand, if the market bulls can force a return above the monthly high of $106,000, Daan Crypto explains that such development would indicate the market correction is over, and Bitcoin may be headed for another price discovery with potential initial targets of around $120,000. Related Reading: XRP Wave Structure Predicts Wild Fluctuations On Its Way To $4 ATH BTC Price Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $104,650 following a price gain of 2.98% in the past day. Using larger time frames , the premier cryptocurrency is up by 1.12% on its weekly chart and 7.49% on the monthly chart indicating a strong bullish control of the market. Interestingly, the Relative Strength Index on the daily chart stands at 51.53 facing upward which supports the notion that Bitcoin’s correction might be over with price eyeing a return to the overbought zone above 70. With a market cap of $2.07 trillion, Bitcoin continues to rank as the world’s largest cryptocurrency and fifth largest asset in the world.

2025-06-08T02:30:52,"Ethereum Enters Strategic Pause: Will Accumulation Below Resistance Spark A Surge?","In a post shared on X by UniChartz, it was noted that Ethereum (ETH) has developed a well-defined bullish structure, characterized by a series of Higher Highs (HH) and Higher Lows (HL), a classic signal of upward momentum. However, after this upward move, ETH has now entered an accumulation phase just below a key resistance zone, suggesting that the market is consolidating before its next potential breakout. EMA Confluence Zone Retest: Ethereum At Crucial Decision Point According to UniChartz, Ethereum is currently navigating a crucial technical juncture as it retests the confluence zone of the 50 EMA and 100 EMA, a region that has historically served as a strong area of demand. This overlap of exponential moving averages often acts as dynamic support, and its relevance is further underscored by the Stochastic RSI rebounding from oversold territory, which may signal an incoming shift in momentum. The analyst suggests that if ETH manages to hold this accumulation zone and support provided by the EMAs, it might open the door to another test of the overhead resistance zone , or potentially, a breakout beyond it. Traders will likely look for volume confirmation and continuation patterns to validate any such upside move. On the other hand, a failure to sustain this zone may signal weakness and lead to a deeper pullback , possibly dragging Ethereum toward lower support levels that have previously acted as stabilization zones. This would mark a temporary shift in market structure and attract more selling pressure in the short term. For now, UniChartz emphasizes that this area remains a critical decision point. The coming price action will be instrumental in shaping Ethereum’s next directional move, and traders should closely monitor whether bulls can defend the EMAs or bears regain control and force a breakdown . Key Levels To Watch In Event Of An ETH Breakout In the event of a confirmed breakout above the current accumulation zone and EMA confluence, Ethereum could be poised for a strong upward continuation. The first major level to monitor, which serves as the breakout trigger point, is the immediate $2,858 resistance zone that has capped recent advances. Related Reading: Ethereum Flashes Bullish Morning Star Candlestick Pattern – Is ETH Rally Getting Started? A clean move above this area, especially with rising volume, would signal strong bullish intent. Once that resistance is cleared, the next key price level to watch lies near the $3,360–$3,659 range, which previously acted as a short-term supply zone and could present minor friction. Pushing beyond that could target the psychological zone around $4,100.

2025-06-08T02:15:41,"Qubetics $TICS Rise, Polkadot Growth, and Stacks Deals: Exploring the Top Cryptos to Join for 2025 Picks for 2025","Cryptocurrency markets are currently experiencing a pivotal moment marked by rapid regulatory shifts and technological breakthroughs redefining participants’ strategies. The buzz around the top cryptos to join for 2025 opportunities intensifies as traders and enthusiasts seek projects with strong fundamentals and real-world applications. Qubetics has emerged as a promising contender in this environment, capturing attention for its innovative approach to blockchain interoperability and its potential to reshape decentralized finance. As the search for the top cryptos to join for 2025 projects heats up, established tokens like Polkadot and Stacks also demonstrate resilience and steady growth. Each of these coins plays a distinctive role in the evolving crypto ecosystem, whether through exchange token utility, supply chain transparency, or multi-chain interoperability. These dynamics are creating a fertile ground for projects that can deliver both technological innovation and practical adoption. The quest for the top cryptos to join for 2025 is more than a race for early gains; it reflects a demand for projects that solve long-standing blockchain inefficiencies while preparing for the future of digital finance. Qubetics stands at the forefront of this movement, offering solutions that address interoperability challenges, enhance security, and streamline cross-chain asset management. This makes it an essential project to watch as blockchain networks grow increasingly interconnected. Qubetics: Bridging Blockchain Interoperability and Unlocking the top cryptos to join for 2025 in 2025 Qubetics ($TICS) continues to carve a compelling niche by tackling one of blockchain’s most persistent hurdles: interoperability. Its crypto presale , currently in the 37th stage, has seen over 515 million tokens sold to upwards of 27,500 holders, raising more than $17.7 million. The token is priced at $0.3370 during this stage, providing an attractive entry point into a project built on solid technological foundations and ambitious goals. Only 10 million $TICS tokens remain in Stage 37 of the Qubetics presale, priced at $0.3370. With over 515M tokens sold and $17.7M+ raised, this is your final opportunity before a 20% price increase at launch. Qubetics has slashed its supply to 1.36B, creating rare scarcity. Act now—or miss out. Recent developments showcase Qubetics’ growing ecosystem, notably through the QubeQode platform and the Qubetics Integrated Development Environment (IDE). These tools empower decentralized app developers and businesses to build cross-chain solutions with enhanced security features. Introducing a decentralized VPN further strengthens user privacy and secure communications, addressing concerns plaguing many contemporary blockchain networks. Polkadot: Connecting Blockchain Networks Through Parachain Innovation Polkadot is a leading multi-chain network that enables different blockchains to transfer messages and assets trustless. Developed by Web3 Foundation and co-founded by Ethereum co-creator Dr. Gavin Wood, Polkadot uses a unique relay chain mechanism to connect independent blockchains, known as parachains, allowing them to operate seamlessly within one ecosystem. This design eliminates bottlenecks and boosts scalability, making Polkadot one of the most forward-thinking Layer-0 solutions. The platform’s native token, DOT, is used for governance, staking, and bonding parachains—making it an essential component for ecosystem participation. Recent developments in the Polkadot ecosystem include accelerated adoption of parachain slots and increased community funding for decentralized applications (dApps). The network has seen a surge in developer activity, especially after the rollout of OpenGov, which offers decentralized on-chain governance to token holders. As Polkadot continues to emphasize interoperability and composability, it is increasingly viewed as a foundational layer for next-generation decentralized infrastructure. With over 550 active projects building on its ecosystem, Polkadot remains a top contender for scalable blockchain solutions in 2025. Stacks: Powering Bitcoin Smart Contracts and Web3 Utility Stacks is a unique Layer-1 blockchain that brings smart contract functionality and decentralized applications to Bitcoin without modifying the original Bitcoin protocol. By using a novel Proof of Transfer (PoX) consensus mechanism, Stacks anchors its security to Bitcoin’s robust network while allowing developers to build smart contracts using its Clarity language. The native token, STX, fuels transaction fees, smart contract execution, and participation in network consensus—creating a full-circle economy around Bitcoin-enabled DeFi and NFTs. The Stacks ecosystem has gained momentum recently due to increasing interest in Bitcoin Layer-2 scalability solutions and the rising demand for decentralized identity and finance on Bitcoin. With Stacks 2.1 now live and features like sBTC (a two-way pegged Bitcoin asset) under development, the platform is positioned to unlock a new era of programmable Bitcoin. This has sparked renewed enthusiasm among builders and institutions aiming to tap into Bitcoin’s liquidity with added functionality. As Bitcoin adoption grows globally, Stacks is seen as a vital bridge between Bitcoin’s store-of-value strength and modern decentralized use cases. Interoperability: Easing Blockchain Integration for All Users Interoperability remains central to Qubetics’ vision, delivering tangible benefits to businesses, professionals, and individuals alike: Businesses: Enable seamless multi-chain asset management and decentralized application integration, reducing operational complexity and costs. Professionals: Provide secure, private communication channels and collaborative environments powered by decentralized VPNs. Individuals: Grant users greater control over digital assets across different blockchain networks, fostering financial inclusivity and privacy. By simplifying interoperability, Qubetics lowers the barrier to blockchain adoption, encouraging ecosystem growth and innovative solutions that traditional finance systems struggle to match. Conclusion: Navigating the 2025 Crypto Landscape with Strategic Presale Opportunities Based on research and analysis, Qubetics, Polkadot, and Stacks represent some of the most compelling opportunities in the current market, each showcasing unique strengths that contribute to their standing among the top cryptos to join for 2025 projects in 2025. Identifying the top cryptos to join for 2025 involves looking beyond mere hype to projects delivering tangible innovation, solid partnerships, and real-world applications. With its focus on interoperability and privacy, Qubetics exemplifies the qualities that define the top cryptos to join for 2025 offerings—combining technology, adoption potential, and community engagement. Engaging with these projects at their presale stages provides early access to blockchain innovations poised to impact the future of decentralized finance and enterprise solutions.

2025-06-08T02:09:17,"Coinbase ends legal battle with BiT Global over wBTC delisting","BiT Global agreed to dismiss its lawsuit against Coinbase for delisting the wBTC after the cryptocurrency exchange launched a competitor token, the cbBTC. In a filing , lawyers for BiT Global, an entity backed by TRON founder Justin Sun, who last year became a strategic partner to BitGo in providing the wBTC-wrapped Bitcoin token, said they had agreed to dismiss the suit with prejudice. This means the case cannot be brought again. Additionally, the two companies each said they would incur their own legal expenses in connection with the complaint Sun’s link to wBTC caused ETH DeFi protocols to stop supporting it as a collateral asset Wrapped Bitcoin tokens facilitate the use of Bitcoin on various blockchain networks. Both wBTC and cbBTC target the Ethereum ecosystem. However, the tokens do not offer any direct claim to the Bitcoin unless one trusts a central intermediary to custody the Bitcoin and release the wrapped token. Sun’s association with wBTC caused Ethereum DeFi protocols MakerDAO and Aave to contemplate disintegrating the support of the token as a collateral asset, ultimately deciding on tougher risk parameters rather than a complete exit. According to reports from credible sources, the lawsuit was filed in December 2024 by Kneupper & Covey on behalf of BiT Global, and it was claimed that if Coinbase delisted wBTC, it would be an example of anti-competitive behavior. It would also break several state and federal laws. The suit highlighted that having demonstrated the value represented by wBTC, Coinbase reversed course and removed wBTC from its platform. This made it impossible for anyone to trade it on Coinbase. The change came shortly after they launched their own similar version: cbBTC. Following the dismissal of the lawsuit, Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s top lawyer, stated that this important win affirms their clear right to manage security and risk for Coinbase users. Grewal added, “…we will not be bullied into continuing to list an asset that puts our customers at risk.” Previously, the exchange’s chief legal officer had defended its approach, stressing its dedication to high listing standards. He wrote on an X post that when an asset does not meet their listing standards anymore, they remove it. He further stated that they would add it to their list if another asset could meet or do better than market requirements while still following those standards. Grewal’s post faced criticism from crypto-industry insiders, including Tron founder Justin Sun, who accused the company of lacking transparency and asked how Grewal’s post squared with previous comments by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. An attached image provided by Sun depicted a screenshot of Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, who says Coinbase was agnostic to assets because it believes that consumers deserve options in the crypto economy. Mike Belshe defends BitGo as having a solid reputation after Sun’s backlash Earlier legal attempts to stop Coinbase from delisting the token were unsuccessful after a federal judge in December sided with Coinbase and said it had the right to delist the token. The transfer of wBTC from being managed only by the custody company BitGo to a partnership involving Sun faced backlash from people in the cryptocurrency world. In response to this criticism, BitGo CEO Mike Belshe revealed that he believes BitGo has a solid reputation because they follow the highest security standards in everything they do. Belshe concluded that Ultimately, he thinks people will see that this is not a big deal. The current market capitalization for the wBTC token is about $13.6 billion, with Coinbase’s cbBTC valued at about $4.7 billion, according to CoinGecko data. Both of these tokens are almost at an all-time high market cap.

However, the analyst emphasized that Bitcoin will ultimately dictate the move. Keeping a close eye on the intraday chart, the expert mentioned that an early pullback could present a scalp opportunity, as long as Bitcoin aligns with the bullish outlook. Breakout Likely With Strong Daily Candles Breaking down his latest analysis, the trader explained that LINK’s daily candle officially closed bullish, marking a key technical point in the current trend. Meanwhile, LINKBTC ended the session on a positive note, which adds weight to the bullish outlook for LINK in the short term. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus However, the analyst emphasized that more bullish daily closes on LINKBTC are needed to confirm momentum. A continuation of strength could lead to an impulsive breakout above the daily candle’s lower high trendline, igniting the next leg upward. A decisive move above the 0.000140 BTC resistance zone is expected to accelerate price action for LINK, giving bulls a clear signal to push higher. If momentum continues to build, LINK could rally toward the $16 resistance level, marking a major target for the current setup. For now, $12.50 remains a key support level on the daily timeframe and will act as a cushion if bearish pressure reemerges. Looking ahead, the analyst pointed out that Bitcoin and Bitcoin Dominance will remain the primary market drivers for Chainlink heading into the weekend. While maintaining a rational outlook, CRYPTOWZRD plans to monitor LINK’s intraday chart closely for any developing setups. Awaiting Chainlink Next Trade Setup In conclusion, CRYPTOWZRD emphasized that LINK’s intraday chart is showing signs of a bullish recovery, closely aligned with Bitcoin’s recent rebound. He expressed optimism that further upside is likely if current conditions persist, particularly if Bitcoin maintains its strength. Related Reading: Chainlink Holds Strong At $15.29 Support – Is A New Breakout Imminent?

He believes such a retracement could offer a favorable early entry point for long positions, especially for short-term or intraday traders looking to capitalize on the volatility. As the market continues to evolve, CRYPTOWZRD advises traders to wait for clear confirmation of the next trade setup before taking action. His statement emphasized that strategic patience will be key in identifying the most rewarding opportunities. For now, traders should track price behavior closely and prepare to act swiftly when the next valid entry signal presents itself.

2025-06-08T01:00:10,"Unstaked Grabs Spotlight With $1 Million Giveaway as Solana Moves Toward $300B and Pi Network Loses Momentum","Crypto sentiment heading into mid-2025 is anything but flat. Solana (SOL) is gaining fresh momentum with analysts speculating on a $300 billion market cap. In contrast, Pi Network (PI) continues to face headwinds, struggling with technical weaknesses and unclear progress. Yet, in a space where attention moves fast, one rising project is pulling focus. That project is Unstaked, a decentralized AI platform combining utility with zero-code tools. It has already sold over 1 billion $UNSD tokens, raised more than $9 million, and kicked off a $1 million Gleam giveaway that has both speculators and builders taking notice. With no private sales and a smart launch structure, Unstaked is being positioned as one of the most bullish crypto coins of 2025. Solana (SOL) Maintains Strength as Analysts Eye a $300B Milestone Solana is showing renewed signs of long-term potential. Price action is consolidating just above a major demand zone following what analysts call a “clean liquidity sweep” on the weekly chart. This pattern, which typically signals the end of a correction and the beginning of a new upward phase, has become a key bullish indicator. The case for Solana is not just about technical setups. On-chain activity continues to climb, with growing developer adoption and a steady expansion of its dApp ecosystem. Institutional interest is rising too, thanks to Solana’s performance efficiency and high transaction throughput. Market watchers are now looking for a retest of previous cycle highs, with targets suggesting a move toward $300 per coin. If realized, that would push Solana toward a $300 billion market cap, potentially making it one of the strongest bullish crypto coins to monitor in the year ahead. Pi Network (PI) Dips Deeper as Bearish Sentiment Spreads While Solana builds upward momentum, Pi Network is showing signs of sustained market weakness. At $0.61, PI has declined steadily from its recent high of $0.66, and technical indicators continue to reflect selling pressure. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dropped to 19.59, marking deep oversold territory. Meanwhile, the Williams %R sits at -94.213, and the MACD has confirmed a bearish crossover. The negative trend is not limited to the charts. Pi Network’s roadmap remains vague, and mainnet progress has been slow to materialize. Without a significant technical or market catalyst, the project appears to be losing favor among early adopters. Unless Bitcoin sees a resurgence or Pi delivers meaningful development updates, continued downside remains the base case scenario. In contrast to bullish crypto coins like Solana, Pi is lagging behind both in momentum and narrative strength. Unstaked Raises $9M and Launches $1M Giveaway as Momentum Builds While the broader market shifts between bullish and bearish sentiment, Unstaked is carving out a path of its own. Currently in Stage 19 of its crypto presale , the project has already sold more than 1 billion $UNSD tokens and raised nearly $9.1 million. At a current price of $0.011065 and a projected listing price of $0.1819, early adopters are eyeing a potential 28x return. But it’s not just about numbers. Unstaked’s protocol runs on a system called Proof of Intelligence, which allows AI agents to operate transparently and adapt through on-chain activity. The platform offers users the ability to create, deploy, and monetize these agents without writing a single line of code. With zero private allocations and fully public token access, Unstaked also presents a fair launch environment that appeals to both retail participants and community-first developers. It’s this combination of accessibility and innovation that positions it as one of the most bullish crypto coins to watch going forward. To amplify awareness and user engagement, Unstaked has rolled out a $1 million Gleam giveaway. Twenty participants will each win $50,000 worth of $UNSD tokens by completing simple tasks and purchasing at least $100 worth of tokens. This promotional campaign runs in tandem with the presale and is already drawing interest across Telegram, X, and crypto forums. The giveaway aligns closely with Unstaked’s roadmap and is being used to bring more wallets on-chain, spread awareness, and create buzz before the official launch. It’s also helping the project reach a wider audience of creators, DAOs, and builders who are looking for practical AI tools with direct application. With over 30% of the presale completed and tools scheduled for rollout shortly after launch, Unstaked is moving quickly and strategically. The project is emerging as more than a headline grabber, it’s becoming a serious contender for long-term growth. Final Thoughts: Utility, Access, and a Clear Road Ahead As we assess the crypto market landscape heading into the second half of 2025, a few key trends stand out. Solana is building strong structural support and targeting a $300 billion market cap, driven by clear fundamentals and market structure. Pi Network is facing steep challenges with weak momentum, limited development visibility, and declining investor confidence. Meanwhile, Unstaked is breaking through the noise. Its combination of AI-native tools, a decentralized and transparent distribution model, and a large-scale public giveaway is generating the kind of momentum rarely seen in presale projects. With over $9 million raised, strong product foundations, and a 28x upside baked into its pricing model, Unstaked could be the sleeper pick that defines the next market cycle.

2025-06-08T00:30:18,"Bitcoin Historical Data Points To Imminent 62% Price Surge – Analyst","The Bitcoin market was recently subject to a significant price dip as a public feud between US President Donald Trump and the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, on Thursday negatively impacted the US financial markets. During this period, the premier cryptocurrency crashed by an estimated 5% from $106,000 to trade below $101,000. Interestingly, despite the short-term volatility, several key technical indicators now point to a potentially bullish setup. In fact, this latest pullback appears to complete a series of signals that historically precede major price rallies. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Negative Funding On Binance – A Classic Setup For A Short Squeeze? Bitcoin Set For Price Surge, First Target At $130,000 In an X post on June 6, a market expert with X username CrypFlow shares a bullish Bitcoin prediction amidst an ongoing price correction. Aside from sharp price decline in the past week, the BTC market has witnessed a steady price correction since the premier cryptocurrency achieved a new-all time high of $111,970 on May 22. However, CrypFlow states that this price retracement alongside a host of other technical indicators suggest that Bitcoin is setting to repeat its price rally from Q4 2024. The first indicator observed by the analyst in the chart above is the golden cross which occurs when the 50-day simple moving average (50SMA) crosses above the 200-day simple moving average (200SMA) in early June 2025. The golden cross is a common bullish indicator that signals a shift in market momentum and was last seen in November 2024. Furthermore, there is a Bitcoin price breakout above a long-standing purple downward trendline that originated in December 2024. This breakout also mirrors another move seen in early November 2024, when BTC breached the descending resistance that began in March 2024. The ongoing price correction represents the final indicator as Bitcoin also suffered an estimated 10% price fall in November falling from $74,500 to $68,500 before initially an explosive price rally. CrypFlow’s analysis suggests that if Bitcoin is repeating its price rally from Q4 2024, the premier cryptocurrency could produce a 62% price gain translating into potential targets around $170,000. However, the analyst has set a more conservative initial price target of $130,000, representing a 25% gain from current market levels.

According to the settlement administrator, the distribution of settlement payments has now begun and will continue over the next several weeks. The 2021 cyberattack compromised the personal data of a staggering 76 million US customers, exposing names, addresses, Social Security numbers, and other sensitive information. T-Mobile agreed to the settlement in July of 2022 to resolve claims from the August 2021 breach. Customers eligible for payments will receive a digital deposit or paper check based on their selection during the claim process, with amounts ranging from $25 to $100, with some eligible for up to $25,000 for substantial documented losses. The settlement also includes two years of free identity protection services for affected customers. The breach, one of the largest in U.S. history, prompted lawsuits accusing T-Mobile of failing to secure customer data. T-Mobile says it has since enhanced its cybersecurity protocols to prevent future incidents, and the company did not admit to any wrongdoing in the settlement.

2025-06-07T23:00:45,"Crypto Analyst Says This Bitcoin Top Signal Hasn’t Gone Off Yet — What To Know","The story has been somewhat the same for the price of Bitcoin over the past week, drifting further from its recently-notched all-time high of $111,814. On Friday, June 6, the premier cryptocurrency fell towards the $101,000 level, reflecting an uptick in the market volatility over the past few days. While the Bitcoin price has quickly recovered from this sudden downturn, there is still real concern about the market leader’s performance since reaching its record-high value. However, a new indicator suggests that the price of BTC might still have some time to run up to a new high. Analyst Predicts Four Months Of Opportunity For BTC In a recent post on the X platform, crypto expert Joao Wedson revealed that there might still be some degree of opportunity in the Bitcoin market. This observation is based on a model, which was accurate in predicting past all-time high prices for the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Related Reading: Traders Turn Bearish on Bitcoin Following High-Profile Political Tensions, Data Shows This revelation is based on the Max Intersect SMA Model (the blue line), which has accurately identified the tops of past Bitcoin cycles. According to Wedson’s post, this cycle top prediction model suggests that the price of BTC could still have around four months of upward growth potential — regardless of the volatility and market shakeout. As seen in the chart above, the price of Bitcoin reaches its current cycle peak whenever the Max Intersect SMA (simple moving average) hits the previous cycle top. In the 2021 cycle, the top prediction model hit the 2018 high of around $19,000 in November 2021, culminating in a then-all-time high of $69,000. Hence, when this Max Intersect SMA hits exactly $69,000 — the price top in the last cycle, that will represent the peak of this current cycle. Wedson also asserted that this model is pretty reliable, as it is backed by 200 tested algorithms. With this top prediction model still a bit off $69,000, the Bitcoin price might still be some months away from its peak. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As mentioned earlier, the price of BTC seems to be struggling after recently hitting its current all-time high above the $110,000 mark. This week’s performance must have tested investors’ patience as the flagship cryptocurrency mostly traded within a consolidation range.

This analysis investigates how their disagreement, particularly surrounding the 'Big Beautiful Bill', has inadvertently acted as a promotional blitz for Bitcoin, while also benefiting two lesser-known altcoins. Bitcoin's Price Rally Amidst Tech Titans' Tussle Amidst the unfolding drama, Bitcoin has shown remarkable resilience and is currently trading between $102,410 and $110,000. The cryptocurrency seems poised for further gains, with potential targets pegged at around $121,600. Source: TradingView The support levels near $99,000 and the close proximity of the 10-day and 100-day price averages suggest a stable upward trajectory. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates that Bitcoin isn't yet overbought, which aligns with a bullish outlook for the near future. The Rally of Ethereum and Its Market Dynamics Ethereum, another major player in the cryptocurrency market, has also seen a notable uptick. The current pricing dynamics reveal a bullish trend, with the cryptocurrency trading between $2410 and $2729.90. Source: TradingView Despite a slight dip this past week, Ethereum has managed a 39% increase over the month, demonstrating substantial market confidence. If Ethereum can surpass the $2920 resistance, it might achieve a new high of around $3240, translating to an 18% gain from its current position.

2025-06-07T22:24:54,"Decoding the Chaos: What the Trump-Musk Clash Really Means for Bitcoin and These 2 Altcoins","The public schism between Donald Trump and Elon Musk has done more than just tank Tesla's stock—it has sent shockwaves through the crypto world. Their feud over the 'Big Beautiful Bill' became an unexpected marketing campaign for Bitcoin and has stirred up significant excitement around two specific altcoins that thrived on the chaos. Curious about which digital currencies are poised for a breakout fueled by this political drama? This article unpacks the recent events and reveals key insights into the potential market movers. Bitcoin's Bullish Surge Continues with Sights Set on $121k Target Source: tradingview Bitcoin currently fluctuates between $102,410 and almost $110,000, showing strong bullish control despite some resistance. The nearest challenge for bulls lies just above $114,000. If momentum continues, Bitcoin could aim for just over $121,600, a potential growth of roughly 12% from current levels. Support remains at around $99,000, giving investors confidence in a strong base. The 10-day and 100-day averages stay close, around $105,000, indicating stability. Bitcoin's RSI suggests it's not overly bought, pointing to room for growth. The recent one-month rise of about 9% highlights potential for further gains, indicating bears are currently held at bay. Ethereum Poised for Explosive Growth, Targets $3240 Source: tradingview Ethereum's price hovers between $2410 and $2729.90, showing slight bullish strength with recent gains of nearly 39% over the past month. However, a minor dip of less than 1% this week suggests some hesitation. The bulls seem slightly weak as they need to push past the $2920 resistance to gain momentum. If Ethereum breaks this level, it could climb over 18% more to approach the $3240 mark. Support is firmly set at about $2280, offering a safety net. Current analysis shows potential for growth, but the market waits to see if bulls can overcome these hurdles and surge past existing resistances. When Opinion Leaders Crash Value, Graphite Offers Trust That Doesn’t Wobble In a landscape where markets still react more to personality than performance, Graphite Network is building a blockchain where reputation is earned by verifiable action . It’s a bold reimagining of digital trust: structural, measurable, and immune to manipulation. Graphite Network runs on the Polymer 2.0 Proof-of-Authority (PoA) blockchain, capable of processing 1,400 transactions per second with consistent, predictable fees. That places it firmly in competition with traditional finance systems in terms of throughput and reliability, while offering the decentralization and auditability TradFi lacks. Beyond just optimizing speed, Graphite Network is redesigning the trust layer. One Account, One Reputation: A Clean Slate for Blockchain Identity Graphite Network enforces a one-account-per-user model via a setup fee paid in $@G, its native token . This model creates a powerful deterrent to spam, simplifies counterparty due diligence, and builds a cleaner, more accountable user base. At the heart of this identity layer is the Trust Score system that evaluates users based on behavioral signals: Transaction history KYC status (optional, but rewarded) Interactions with other verified accounts For decentralized apps, this system enables risk-aware user filtering, empowering platforms and users to set their own thresholds for trust. Graphite Network Bets Big on Reputation-Led Blockchain in 2025 When volatility has again exposed the emotional core of financial markets, Graphite Network is advancing a different thesis: that trust, if structurally embedded, can outperform hype. The core of its 2025 roadmap is a push to operationalize reputation as infrastructure where Layer-2 solutions will blur the line between blockchain and behavioral credibility. Among its flagship rollouts: Phonebook Reputation MVP: A decentralized ID model linking Trust Scores to phone numbers via smart contracts. The goal is to allow users to evaluate counterparty risk in real-time using a phone number as a proxy for on-chain trustworthiness. Hotspot Bundle Initiative: A hardware-software package designed to onboard remote and underbanked populations into the Graphite ecosystem. Participants will be able to operate nodes and earn income, effectively lowering the barrier to Web3 participation. Geo Game Powered by DePIN: An educational gaming product simulating real-world macro conditions such as inflation and resource scarcity. Users will interact with on-chain economies in a controlled, gamified environment. Graphite Network brings the blockchain one step closer to real-world usability: a trusted, intuitive environment for everyone — from everyday users to enterprise builders. Learn More about Graphite Network Conclusion In decoding the market chaos from the Trump-Musk clash, a clear, multi-layered picture emerges. The feud reinforced Bitcoin's dominance as the market's safe haven and highlighted Ethereum's position as a major altcoin poised for its own breakout. Beyond these leaders, the event also shined a spotlight on projects like Graphite Network, which offers not a trade on the current system, but a fundamental investment in a new one immune to such political drama. The key takeaway is that the chaos creates distinct opportunities: to ride the momentum of established leaders or to invest in the foundations of a more stable future.

2025-06-07T22:00:10,"Can Bitcoin Price Bounce To $120,000 Or Will It Break Below $100,000?","The Bitcoin price has continued to trade sideways since hitting a new all-time high (ATH) of $111,900 earlier in May. Amid the current price action, crypto analyst Decode has provided insights into whether the leading crypto will rally to $120,000 or drop below $100,000 next. Analyst Reveals What’s Next For The Bitcoin Price In an X post, Decode shared an accompanying chart in which he made an ABC wave analysis of the current Bitcoin price action. Based on his analysis, the leading crypto is expected to drop below $100,000 before it rallies to a new ATH of $120,000. The chart showed that BTC could fall to as low as $96,500 on the Wave B corrective move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Bounces Off Re-Accumulation Zone: Why $120,000 Could Be Next This drop to $96,500 is expected to happen this month. Once that is done, Decode predicts that the Bitcoin price could rally above $120,500 before the end of July. This will mark the Wave C impulsive move to the upside. This aligns with veteran trader Peter Brandt’s prediction that BTC could reach as high as $150,000 by late summer. However, crypto analyst KillaXBT has predicted that the Bitcoin price could hit the $120,000 target by mid-June. This coincides with the June FOMC meeting, which is scheduled for June 17 and 18. A Fed rate cut could serve as the catalyst for such a parabolic rally from the current BTC price level. According to CME FedWatch data, there is a 97.4% chance that the Fed would keep interest rates unchanged. As such, market participants aren’t expecting a rate cut, which is why the Bitcoin price could pump massively if Jerome Powell and the FOMC were to surprise everyone. Moreover, US President Donald Trump yesterday urged the Fed to cut rates by a full point. A Breakout Might Be On The Cards In an X post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto suggested that a breakout could be imminent for the Bitcoin price. He noted that BTC is progressing inside a 4-hour falling wedge, which indicates a bullish reversal pattern. If confirmed, the analyst stated that the breakout could target the $107,500 and $109,500 zones, which are the Fibonacci confluence areas. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Puts Bitcoin Price At $120,000 If This Range Breakout Happens Crypto analyst Kevin Capital highlighted the solid V-shape recovery for the Bitcoin price after the leading crypto dropped to as low as $100,000 on May 5. However, the analyst noted that BTC’s rebound back to the $105,000 zone won’t matter until it breaks above the $106,800 level. The leading crypto must also show actual follow-through with 3-day to 1-week closes to support a breakout. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $105,000.

The New York court decision on President Trump’s tariff plan boosted investor sentiment mid-week. Last week’s fund flows highlighted a slight geographical shift, although the United States remained dominant due to institutional demand. A String Of Consecutive Weekly Inflows The digital asset market remains bullish following recent global institutional investment. A recent CoinShares Fund Flows shows a $286 million inflow, marking the seventh consecutive weekly gain. Bitcoin, the largest crypto by market cap, saw swift exits, recording $8 million outflows. Bitcoin started the week in the green zone on the heels of institutional accumulation but lost steam after a New York court decided on recent White House tariffs. Still, Bitcoin price trades within the $106k zone, though down from its $111k all-time high. Bulls are optimistic due to publicly-listed firms acquiring the assets. Michael Saylor’s Strategy purchased 705 BTC on Monday, taking holdings to 580,955 BTC. Although the buy was the smallest in several weeks, Strategy bolstered wider interest. Japanese Metaplanet also scooped up more assets in the same period. Meanwhile, Ether was the highest gainer last week as institutional funds attracted a massive $321 million. This brings the figure for the last six weeks to $1.19 billion as investors remain keen on an altcoin resurgence. Monthly figures are now up to $889 million while assets under management jumped above $14 billion. Spot Ethereum ETFs in the United States also notched gains within the week. Last month, the general spike in decentralized finance (DeFi) activities was a major ETH driver. This string of bullish inflows marks the highest Ether run since December 2024. XRP Loses Institutional Momentum Per the data, XRP shed $28 million in the last seven days, stretching monthly losses, while year-to-date figures remain in the green zone. XRP saw huge gains earlier this year on the back of an expected spot ETF approval, but lost momentum after delayed decisions by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Odds are still in favor for an approval this year. “ Regionally, investor focus shifted somewhat away from the US, which still recorded inflows of US$199m last week. Germany and Australia saw inflows of US$42.9m and US$21.5m, respectively. Meanwhile, Hong Kong experienced its strongest weekly post-seed inflows since the launch of exchange-traded products just over a year ago, totalling US$54.8 million.”",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/ether-outshines-btc-xrp-institutional-products-following-321-million-pump/,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING|XRP","Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Ethereum News|XRP News",cryptocompare
2025-06-07T21:35:06,"Attorney Addresses Claims of Ripple’s XRP Having No Legal Clarity","Prominent attorney and cryptocurrency legal expert Bill Morgan has addressed claims made by market participants regarding the legal status of the XRP token. The lawyer fired back at an X user who made several claims about the token, including a statement that XRP’s legal status remains undefined. Bill Morgan retorted, explaining that the Judge had in fact established that XRP was not a security. Notably, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission did not counter the Judge’s assertion during the legal battle between the regulator and Ripple. “This is a lie. XRP has been found by a judge not itself to be a security. The SEC Appeal did not challenge that finding. To say XRP has no legal clarity is the biggest lie I have seen in crypto this year.” The attorney wrote . Analisa Torres, the judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, remarked that XRP was not an investment contract. However, Morgan said the judge’s opinion, also known as a “dicta,” does not qualify as a formal ruling. “Dicta does provide a degree of legal clarity. It is persuasive authority, and there is no finding to the contrary that XRP is a security. Also persuasive is the reasoning that led to the funding that XRP is not a security. It has more judicial clarity than Bitcoin which has none.” He added. The attorney countered other Bitcoin-related claims, further establishing Bitcoin’s position in the market. “Bitcoin has not been deemed to be a commodity. Courts don’t deem things, they make findings.” He wrote. While there might have been an instance of an obiter, an in-passing statement made by a Judge, describing Bitcoin as a commodity, the attorney maintains that there is yet to be a court case in which Bitcoin has been declared a commodity.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/attorney-addresses-claims-of-ripples-xrp-having-no-legal-clarity/,"BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|SPONSORED|XRP","Cryptocurrency|Featured|News|Ripple|XRP News",cryptocompare

The Ethereum competitor will likely rally towards its $165 target, a 13% rally within the next week. While Ethereum draws the interest of institutional investors, Solana is competing through partnerships and decentralized applications on the blockchain. Table of Contents Solana price forecast SOL could rally for these three reasons Solana derivatives analysis How Trump-Musk tussle influenced Solana price Solana: A one-trick pony or not Solana price forecast According to technical indicators on the SOL/USDT daily price chart, Solana ( SOL ) could soon observe a trend reversal. SOL is trading at $149.92, and the Ethereum ( ETH ) competitor could rally 13% and test resistance at $170, the upper boundary of the FVG on the daily price chart. Above $170, there are two key resistances: R1, which is the psychologically important price level of $200, and R2, which is the lower boundary of an FVG on the daily price chart, at $218.40. The RSI on the SOL/USDT price chart reads 39 and slopes upwards. MACD flashes red histogram bars under the neutral line. The OBV indicator shows a bullish divergence, with the price heading downwards while the OBV indicator slopes upward. The divergence is typically a sign of a potential trend reversal. In this case, the consolidation likely ends and SOL price changes in the coming week.

Solana’s meme coin ecosystem tanked in response to the tussle between U.S. President Donald Trump and Tesla Chief Elon Musk. In the past week, the past 24 hours, and on Friday, the sector’s market capitalization has declined. The market cap of the Solana meme coin ecosystem has fallen 5% in the past 24 hours to nearly $10 billion. It is likely that once the tussle settles, Solana could resume its uptrend.

Solana derivatives data analysis | Source: Coinglass How Trump-Musk tussle influenced Solana price The public spat between the U.S. President and Tesla Chief made headlines for its impact on Nasdaq, Tesla stock price, and Bitcoin ( BTC ), among other things. Solana’s price slipped, alongside other altcoins, as traders turned risk-off. Sentiment shifted from neutral to fear in the past day. Solana has made strides with gains on Friday, it remains to be seen whether the token can wipeout the losses from the past seven days, in the coming week. The Trump-Musk tussle’s impact is felt in the Solana meme coin ecosystem, with a steep decline in market capitalization. A 5% drop within a 24-hour timeframe is significant, and a recovery is less likely unless led by a catalyst. Solana: A one-trick pony or not Analysts at Standard Chartered, the banking giant, labeled Solana a one-trick pony for the meme coin ecosystem’s role in pushing SOL’s price and value higher in the past year. However, it is likely that there is more to SOL with stablecoins, DeFi protocols and partnership announcements in 2025 alone. Standard Chartered meme coins have stress-tested the blockchain in the past, proving its scalability and throughput are effective and paving the way for higher adoption and partnerships. In their report, Standard Chartered suggests Solana expand to other sectors to boost its utility, however SOL generates higher volume and utility from meme coin transactions in the past year. While usage may have declined since the peak of the meme coin rally. Meme coin utility peak | Source: Standard Chartered Solana trades at $150 at the time of writing on Friday.

2025-06-07T21:27:37,"Satoshi Namakoto’s Net Worth to Topple Warren Buffett’s if Bitcoin Makes this Move","Following Bitcoin’s break above $111,000, market participants have been more bullish than ever, anticipating a continuous upward movement for the asset. Notably, one prominent analyst whose bullish sentiments remain untested is predicting that Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous founder of Bitcoin, could record a massive increase in his net worth. In the near term, Nakamoto’s net worth could topple that of longtime Billionaires Warren Buffett and Mark Zuckerberg , he asserted. Eric Balchunas, the senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg who took to X to share his outlook, is painting a bullish scenario for Bitcoin to validate this prediction. Balchunas outlined the possibilities in a post shared with his 357,000 followers, remarking that Satoshi Nakamoto could be catapulted to a new position in the world’s billionaire list if Bitcoin follows its historical yearly trend of attaining a 50% increase in price value. This year, Nakamoto could replace Warren Buffett and go on to knock out Mark Zuckerberg to become the second richest billionaire, he asserted. At report time, Bitcoin is trading at $105,422. A 50% increase in Bitcoin’s current price will result in a total value of $158,133. “If bitcoin does its normal 50%, then Satoshi will pass Buffett this year and Zuck sometime next year-ish to be #2 richest in the world (Elon has a huge lead). It’s fascinating to ponder that the founder of something so successful never cashed in. It echoes Jack Bogle in that regard.” The analyst wrote . His sentiments come as market participants revisited the famous Satoshi Nakamoto Bitcoin wallet addresses “1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa,” to find that the Bitcoin founder’s holdings had risen to $120 billion worth of Bitcoin.

As of June 3, Buffett’s net worth of $154 billion made him the sixth richest billionaire on the Forbes list , while Zuckerberg holds the second position with a net worth of $216 billion.

As a ratings platform, Weiss Ratings reported that interest levels make up 50% of the federal deficit. “Total U.S. federal debt is $34 trillion. That’s an increase of $11 trillion in just four years, the fastest pace in history. At roughly $1 trillion a year, interest alone now accounts for half the federal deficit.” The report read. Speaking on the dangers of the new development in the U.S. economy, Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, brought attention to the emerging U.S. debt market crisis. “It’s a big deal, it is a real problem,” he remarked. Bitcoin as an antidote to economic collapse In a follow-up response, Weiss’s Crypto rating outlined a bullish scenario that could unfold if the current market pattern continues. Should the Treasury market collapse with the introduction of new issuance, the Federal Reserve system could kick off a fiat currency printing spree; a move that could position Bitcoin and other crypto assets as better alternatives. “The moment the Treasury market cracks under a mountain of new issuance, the Fed will ride to the rescue to buy U.S. government debt. They will print with reckless abandon, debase the currency, launching crypto (and other assets) straight into the stratosphere.” The report read. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are increasingly considered alternative assets capable of combating inflation for traditional market players.

2025-06-07T21:15:56,"DappRadar: DeFi and NFT Upticks in May Could Mark Start of Recovery","As Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high in May, sparking momentum across cryptocurrencies, the decentralized app industry also saw a revival. In fact, DappRadar’s latest findings identify May 2025 as a turning point for the dapp sector. During the same period, the NFT market also saw signs of life. Turning Point for the Dapp Ecosystem In May, the dapp industry exhibited renewed optimism as the daily Unique Active Wallets (dUAW) rose 8% to 25 million, amid broader positive market trends. Notable growth was seen in three key sectors: AI dapps surged 23% to 4.8 million dUAW, social dapps grew 21% to 4.3 million, and NFT dapps increased 9% to 3.9 million. These sector-specific gains indicate stronger user engagement and contribute to a more balanced dapp ecosystem, according to DappRadar’s report . Meanwhile, AI, DeFi, and gaming dapps were found to have been converging in terms of user activity, and each captured a similar share, which evidenced a diversified and maturing market The DeFi sector also maintained strong growth as the Total Value Locked (TVL) surged by 25% to around $200 billion. This growth aligns with the overall market rally, driven by Bitcoin’s new all-time high and Ethereum’s 40% price increase, which boosted DeFi asset values and liquidity. Decentralized exchange Hyperliquid stood out by reaching $244 billion in trading volume, capturing about 10% of Binance’s market share despite massive criticism from prominent industry players after the controversial handling of a market manipulation incident. This achievement positioned Hyperliquid among the top 5 exchanges by trading volume, across both centralized and decentralized platforms, and within the top 10 by TVL across all blockchain networks. NFT Market Rebounds Meanwhile, the NFT market showed renewed activity in May, with trading volume rising 40% month-over-month to $280 million. Transaction counts also climbed 35%, totaling 2.7 million. Although these figures signal improving momentum, DappRadar said that it is premature to call it a full recovery. Continued growth over the coming months will be crucial, but the recent gains still offer a promising sign for the sector. Ethereum regained its lead in the NFT market in May, with a 30% jump in trading volume and a 53% market share. It was followed by Immutable zkEVM at 13% and Abstract at 10%. Abstract’s 1200% surge was largely driven by speculation tied to farming incentives and potential airdrops.

2025-06-07T20:59:39,"Crypto Analyst Projects Mega Bitcoin Drive as Whales Resume Accumulation","Bitcoin (BTC) traders are flagging green signals after retail shakeups that saw swift offloads. This led to slight losses in Bitcoin institutional products last week, although the recent court decision on tariffs played a huge role. Several crypto analysts have tipped another bull movement due to whale purchases and long-term holder repositioning. Bitcoin Whales Are Buying Heavy On-chain data shows massive institutional Bitcoin adoption, potentially opening up a new bull phase. Digital asset analyst Amr Taha pointed to increased spot volumes, whale accumulations, and other positive metrics behind higher Bitcoin trader optimism. According to the data, long-term holders (LTH) net realized metric soared above the $20 billion mark. This becomes crucial to access the market’s state in line with historical data. LTH rapid buys always precede a bullish phase, as seen in 2021 and 2024. Recent movements also spiked optimism to new highs, backed by new capital flows. Long-term holders received this traction because, unlike retail traders who often prioritize profit taking, they refrain from sales during price dips. “ The convergence of rising exchange dominance, long-term holder confidence, and supply tightening paints a bullish picture for Bitcoin. While short-term corrections are possible, the underlying demand and reduction in available BTC on exchanges suggest that the uptrend is far from over. Furthermore, outflows from centralized crypto exchanges led to price gains before another correction. In the last 48 hours, Kraken and Bitfinex saw over 20,000 BTC offloads. Transfers out of exchanges soar trader confidence due to a higher chance of long-term holdings and decentralized finance (DeFi) activities in the case of meme coins. Crypto trader Ali Martinez flagged massive whale accumulations this week. Over the last four days, whales picked up 30,000 BTC, highly influenced by surging institutional participation . Mainstream Adoption Behind Soaring Bitcoin Optimism CryptoQuant data shows wallets with above 1000 BTC adding tokens at a steady pace. An interesting aspect is the “young/new whale addresses” have gained more exposure to Bitcoin in the last two months. This is directly linked to growing institutional interest in crypto assets. While the United States leads the pack, other jurisdictions have also beefed up holdings. Michael Saylor’s Strategy continues to accumulate above 581,000 tokens worth approximately $60.4 billion. As companies increase exposure, governments are leaning toward the market, seeking to drive investment.

Weekend losses have yet to be cleared off, as altcoins show a downward trend. One market participant has revisited his outlook for the long-awaited altcoin season, when altcoins rake in massive gains and outperform the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Benjamin Cowen, a prominent cryptocurrency analyst and the CEO of crypto analytical tool CryptoVerse, has recently resisted bullish altcoin sentiments. “I think we will see ALT /BTC pairs get rejected at their bull market support band,” the analyst wrote in a post shared with X. He highlighted the pair’s historical performance from 2018, exposing a downward reversal trend recorded at critical resistance levels. With altcoins collectively nursing losses, the analyst revisited his prediction, observing that the ALT/BTC pairs were rejected from the bull market support band, further sending the asset to lower lows on May 31st.

2025-06-07T20:30:44,"Watch Out For These Levels If Bitcoin Price Returns To $100K: Blockchain Firm","The Bitcoin price has not had quite the same spark it did at the beginning of the last month so far in June. The premier cryptocurrency has somewhat struggled to break out of a consolidation range since reaching a new all-time high in the month of May. The Bitcoin price recently succumbed to bearish pressure, falling to around $101,000 on Friday, June 6. While the market leader has enjoyed some resurgence to begin the weekend, a prominent blockchain firm has now identified significant levels in the event of a return to the $100,000 level in the coming days. Here Are The Next Support Levels For BTC In a June 6 post on the social media platform X, crypto analytics firm Sentora (previously known as IntoTheBlock) revealed an interesting on-chain perspective on the price of Bitcoin and its latest dip toward $100,000. According to the intelligence platform, there are some significant levels lying just beneath the six-figure valuation threshold. This analysis is based on the average cost basis of several Bitcoin investors and the distribution of the BTC supply around the current price. For context, cost-basis analysis basically evaluates the capacity of a price level to act as support or resistance, depending on the volume of crypto last acquired by investors at this level. As observed in the chart below, the size of the dots directly corresponds with the quantity of BTC purchased within each price bracket and the region’s capacity to act as support or resistance. This implies that the larger the dot, the higher the number of coins purchased, and the stronger the support or resistance level; the green dots are support (as they are usually below the current price), while the red dots serve as resistance (as they are above the asset price). According to data by Sentora, the Bitcoin price seems to have major support within the $95,000 – $99.000 region due to heavy accumulation by investors. This price zone would serve as an on-chain cushion for the Bitcoin price, as investors with their cost bases around the level are likely to defend their positions by acquiring more coins if the price falls toward the $95,000 – $99,000 zone. Sentora mentioned that if the bulls do defend this support level, the Bitcoin price could be in for an extended rally. On the flip side, the on-chain firm asked investors to expect a surge in volatility if this support level fails to hold. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC sits just above $104,400, reflecting an almost 3% increase in the past 24 hours.
