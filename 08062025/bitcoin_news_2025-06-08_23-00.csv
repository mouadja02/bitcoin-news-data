2025-06-08T20:00:43,"JPMorgan Warns Slowdown Gradually Seeping Up and Spreading Across US Economy Despite Job Growth Topping Estimates","Banking giant JPMorgan Chase warns that cracks are beginning to appear in various sectors of the US economy, even as the headlines remain upbeat. In a new CNBC interview, JPMorgan chief global strategist David Kelly says that hard data is suggesting that the US economy is losing steam despite adding 139,000 jobs in May, beating expectations, and keeping the unemployment rate steady at 4.2%. But under the hood, Kelly points out that the Labor Department revised down job gains in March and April, while noting that the US lost hundreds of thousands of jobs last month. “This was a lot softer than the headlines suggested. To me, the one issue is that we saw over 600,000 jobs lost according to the Household Survey. That’s very volatile, but that was a negative signal. The other thing is cutting 95,000 [jobs] out of the prior two months. So we’ve only averaged 124,000 jobs so far this year, per month, for the first five months of the year. It was 168,000 last year. When I’m looking at a lot of data, this slowdown is gradually seeping up and spreading across the economy. I think we’re missing it because we’re looking at headline payroll numbers or the weirdness in terms of trade and GDP. But this economy is gradually slowing down here.” Data from the Pennsylvania-based lender PNC Bank shows that the number of adults working or looking for work dropped by 625,000 in May, effectively negating the number of jobs lost in the same month. According to the bank, the labor force contraction may indicate that “potential workers are becoming discouraged.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-08T20:00:39,"Tether’s USDT Gains Traction in LATAM as IPO Valuation Buzz Grows","Tether (USDT) is consolidating its hold on the stablecoin market with massive expansion into Latin America. In a significant move, the stablecoin giant made inroads into Bolivia in October 2024 when Banco BISA, a banking giant, secured custody services for Tether . Now, Tether is gaining traction among retail users. USDT Now Accepted in Bolivia as Inflation Drives Adoption Notably, Bolivian merchants are now listing goods prices directly in USDT, suggesting the stablecoin’s payment acceptance. This marks Tether’s shift from speculative investment to everyday practical use. The development is practical for users in a Latin American country where fiat currency volatility and the high inflation rate are challenging. The stablecoin offers better predictability and provides a stable digital alternative. Tether’s decision to allow local merchants to price goods in USDT could boost consumer confidence and enable stablecoin to gain traction as a medium of exchange. Consumers could easily adapt, see it as the new normal, and embrace it for convenience. Tether’s USDT could help lower the losses incurred from inflation and currency devaluation by positioning itself as both a transactional currency and a store of value. This might serve as a catalyst to its adoption by consumers outside of crypto. Tether’s Market Cap Surges to $154.85B Amid Valuation Speculation As per CoinMarketCap data , USDT is the leading stablecoin with a market cap of $154.85 billion, with high liquidity and trust in the crypto industry. Its expansionary move could further grow its value to a higher level, given that in the last quarter of 2024, its market cap was just about $120 billion . Meanwhile, Jon Ma, a fintech analyst, has provided insights into Tether’s valuation should the stablecoin giant decide to go public. According to Ma, Tether could be worth approximately 515 billion based on its massive unrealized gains from Bitcoin and gold reserves. With an assumed public valuation of $515 billion, Tether could become one of the top 20 largest companies globally. Paolo Ardoino Downplays IPO Necessity Interestingly, Paolo Ardoino, Tether’s CEO, referred to the projections as potentially conservative. This suggests that the figures could rank higher if Tether decides to go public. However, Ardoino maintains there is no need for the stablecoin giant to go public via an initial public offering (IPO). Unlike Circle, which has officially filed for an IPO , Tether appears determined to maintain its current private ownership structure.

Related Reading: Elon Musk ‘Will Do Anything’ To Make XRP King, Tech Mogul Says However, numerous users find nothing in their accounts. The problem has caused a wave of complaints on the internet and a call for concrete explanations. Users Report Missing Pi Balances According to community reports, hundreds of posts show zero tokens even after following every step. Some users say they waited days. Others say they’ve waited weeks. All of them finished KYC and locked in their accounts on mainnet. Yet their wallets still read “0.00 Pi.” The lack of visible tokens has left many feeling shut out. Stop talking nonsense. I don’t want to hear it. Give me back that damn $Pi. I’ve worked hard for six years. You still haven’t mapped it for me until now. What’s your reason for constantly delaying?

That has users scratching their heads. One person found two wallets under the same profile. Another spotted three. It’s raising questions over how safe the system is. Users are worried they might lose tokens or fall into a trap. Foundation Moves 277 Million Pi Coins Blockchain data shows that the Pi Foundation’s wallet ending in “ODM” transferred 276,500,000 Pi coins recently. A withdrawal of 7,380,000 Pi by the same address happened today. According to on-chain records, weekly withdrawals of large amounts have taken place from OKX exchange. The purpose of these moves remains unexplained by the Pi Core Team. Community Demands Clear Answers Community members note it’s been three months without a detailed update from the project’s leaders. They want dates, explanations, and plans. Some posts urge the team to post a public timeline. Others demand live Q&A sessions. The calls are loud enough to push the topic onto the trending list on social media. Team Issues Wallet Safety Tips Pi Network’s support channels recently posted a list of wallet safety tips. They discussed good practices for passwords and how to identify phishing. But they failed to address why tokens are concealed. The tips also failed to discuss the sudden emergence of numerous wallets per user. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Hit $180,000 In 2025?

Nothing has been confirmed by the Pi Core Team beyond the safety note. It remains unclear when users will see their Pi tokens or receive a full breakdown of those massive transfers.

2025-06-08T19:47:59,"Expert Says Bitcoin and XRP Could Push Cardano (ADA) to Top Five. Here’s how","Cardano (ADA) is garnering new attention from market analysts who believe it may soon emerge as one of the leading assets in the cryptocurrency space. Among the most vocal is analyst Tim Warren, who recently stated that ADA could significantly benefit from its increasing association with Bitcoin and XRP, two of the most prominent blockchain ecosystems. Speaking during a recent episode of the Investing Broz podcast, Warren suggested that Cardano is well-positioned to capitalize on the upcoming altcoin rally. He emphasized that its growing engagement with cross-chain projects could enable the asset to outperform competitors in the medium term. According to Warren, this renewed momentum could potentially elevate Cardano into the top five digital assets by market capitalization. Mending Fences With the XRP Army The Cardano network, under the leadership of founder Charles Hoskinson, has recently adopted a more collaborative approach within the broader blockchain sector. One major focus has been on cultivating productive relationships with other established networks. In particular, Cardano has taken meaningful steps to align itself with Ripple. After years of hostility, Hoskinson has made public efforts to mend past tensions with the XRP community. He has expressed interest in working with Ripple and XRP and potentially integrating RLUSD , Ripple’s stablecoin, into the Cardano ecosystem. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This shift toward collaboration has also coincided with the release of a promotional Ripple video that briefly included Cardano’s logo, a detail that many observers interpret as a confirmation of collaboration. The Connection With Bitcoin Parallel to these developments, Cardano has been working on infrastructure that would allow it to access liquidity from Bitcoin. Through ongoing improvements to its native Lace wallet and planned protocol upgrades, the project aims to introduce decentralized finance capabilities to users holding Bitcoin, thereby expanding the utility of both chains. Warren believes these initiatives may have a transformative impact on Cardano’s position in the market. By integrating aspects of both XRP and Bitcoin into its strategy, Cardano could see a rise in developer activity, higher total value locked in its ecosystem, and increased investor confidence. For ADA to reach the top five, its market capitalization would need to grow by nearly 300%, with price levels approaching $2.60. Cardano (ADA) has shown short-term strength after rebounding from $0.619 to $0.669. The asset is now trading at $0.665, and Warren sees continued bullish momentum, with a potential rise to $1 by June. Positive weekly indicators and multi-chain growth support this outlook. Some forecasts even predict that Cardano (ADA) could hit $10 . Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Saylor cited a chart showing each BTC purchase by the company as an orange dot, asking for “more orange to be posted” on the chart. This suggests that the company will announce that it will be purchasing BTC, likely tomorrow. The company has likely already made the purchase and will announce it tomorrow.

Tech mogul Elon Musk is feuding with President Donald Trump, and meme coin prices tumbled, while Circle made headlines with a stronger-than-expected initial public offering. Institutional appetite for Bitcoin intensified as Strategy and Semler Scientific bolstered their treasuries, and Japan’s Metaplanet unveiled a massive $5.3 billion BTC acquisition plan. Meanwhile, regulatory shifts took shape, with the UK lifting its retail crypto ETN ban and Ripple’s RLUSD gaining approval in Dubai. From Robinhood’s European expansion to Yuga Labs proposing the end of ApeCoin governance, the week revealed growing divides between legacy players and new strategies reshaping the crypto economy. Trump, Musk conflict weighs on meme coin performance Tensions between Trump and Musk reached a boiling point Thursday and continued over the weekend. Musk, who reportedly contributed $295 million to Republicans in the 2024 election year (most of that money going to Trump), grew angry with the GOP for its attempts to pass a sweeping budget bill. When Trump criticized Musk publicly, the Tesla CEO alleged on X that the president is named in confidential criminal files involving sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The public dispute has negatively impacted meme coins associated with both figures, with the Official Trump ( TRUMP ) and Dogecoin ( DOGE ) ranking among the 10 worst-performing cryptocurrencies over 24 hours, according to CoinGecko.

In a new press release , the New York Department of Transportation (DOT) warns the city about the scam, which uses fraudulent QR codes to steal victims’ payment data. Authorities say that the QR codes lead to malicious third-party websites that ask for credit card data, while noting that the legitimate ways to pay for parking in New York are through the ParkNYC app or on the meters themselves. Source: New York DOT As stated by New York DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, “Consumers beware: scammers are targeting parking meters, and we want you to be vigilant. If you see a QR code on a parking meter, do not scan it, and please report it. This is a scam to collect your payment information, and we are working with law enforcement to hold those responsible accountable.” According to the press release, authorities have started aggressively combating the scheme by conducting city-wide inspections, removing the QR codes and setting up ways for residents to report fake QR codes. If a fake QR code is spotted, residents are asked to tear it down and contact ParkNYC.

This revelation comes amid VivoPower’s broader initiative to integrate XRP into its treasury strategy —a pioneering move that captures global attention. VivoPower’s Bold XRP-Centric Strategy VivoPower International PLC, a Nasdaq-listed clean energy firm, recently announced a groundbreaking private placement that raised $121 million. Its primary objective: to become the first publicly traded company with a treasury strategy centered on XRP. This capital infusion was largely led by His Royal Highness Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki bin Talal Al Saud, who committed approximately $100 million through Eleventh Holding Company. CEO Kevin Chin emphasized the move’s significance for both VivoPower and the broader XRP community, stating that the company aims not only to acquire XRP but also to build decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions on the XRP Ledger (XRPL).

This revelation aligned with the prince’s statement in the VivoPower press release: “We have been investors in the digital asset sector for a decade and have been long‑term holders of XRP”. Strategic Timing and Political Context This moment carries geopolitical resonance. Prince Abdulaziz’s support appears to be influenced by conversations during a recent meeting with U.S. political leadership, including President Donald Trump. According to the prince, those high-level discussions helped affirm that the present time is ideal for rolling out digital assets and blockchain solutions in Saudi Arabia. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Adding weight to the strategy, the VivoPower capital raise echoes the playbook pioneered by Bitcoin’s advocacy through Strategy, the so-called “XRP for corporate treasury” vision. VivoPower is aiming to replicate such a treasury-led approach, now focused on XRP. What Comes Next A shareholder vote scheduled for June 18 remains a key pending step. If approved, VivoPower intends to allocate the bulk of the funds to XRP accumulation and development of XRPL-based DeFi applications, while also addressing corporate debt and supporting operations. Broader Implications for XRP and Institutional Adoption This development marks a significant milestone for XRP’s institutional narrative. It signals a departure from public companies favoring Bitcoin and Ethereum for treasury allocation, opening a new precedent with XRP as the focal asset. The engagement of a Middle Eastern royal investor, combined with high-level U.S. discussions, underscores rising geopolitical and financial interest in XRP. For XRP holders and observers, VivoPower’s move, anchored by a committed long-term investor and Ripple ecosystem expertise, is poised to be a defining moment in crypto treasury diversification.

This new reality project seems designed to tap into that existing interest in blockchain and digital assets. Safety Alerts And Scams Warning On May 22, producers issued a warning: “We support Bitcoin and no other memecoin.” They’re trying to head off fake tokens and pump-and-dump schemes. In the past, big promotions have drawn copycat coins that vanish as soon as they peak. Contestants and fans alike are being urged to stay vigilant and only trust official channels. Real-World Risks For Crypto Holders Security experts say high asset values can make crypto figures targets. In May 2024, French police rescued the father of an entrepreneur held in suburbia after attackers severed one finger. In another case, masked men tried to abduct the family of Pierre Noizat, CEO of French exchange Paymium. And late last month, three teenagers from Florida allegedly kidnapped a man at gunpoint in Las Vegas and drove him over 70 miles to a desert near White Hills, Arizona. Victims found themselves blindfolded and warned not to look back. As Netflix readies House of Streams, it faces two challenges. First, it must satisfy viewers looking for both fun and authenticity. Second, it must navigate the very real dangers that follow high-value crypto prizes.

2025-06-08T18:12:04,"Bitcoin Pushes Toward $107K Even as Trump Sends National Guard to Los Angeles","Bitcoin (BTC) BTC maintained a steady climb Saturday as U.S. domestic tensions intensified. Markets remained focused on crypto resilience despite unsettling headlines, including an immigration-related standoff in Los Angeles. According to a report by CNBC, over 100 arrests have been reported as clashes continued between protesters and federal agents, prompting President Trump to authorize the deployment of 2,000 National Guard troops. By Sunday morning, elements of the 79th Infantry Brigade had arrived on-site, according to Northern Command. Further escalation came with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth warning that U.S. Marines at Camp Pendleton could also be mobilized if violence persists. Still, Bitcoin’s stability at $106,332 suggests crypto investors remain unfazed, treating the unrest as a regional event rather than a market-moving crisis. Bitcoin traded within a narrow $1,057 range, from $105,043 to $106,101, and is currently hovering at $106,332. The price action showed a strong rebound after briefly dipping below $105,100, as buying interest re-emerged around the $105,400 support level, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. An early breakout attempt above $106,100 ran into selling pressure, creating a high-volume resistance zone. That move was short-lived as profit-taking set in, though the coin held onto its gains. The consolidation structure remains bullish, with the pattern of higher lows hinting at a potential push toward $107,000 if resistance breaks cleanly. Despite broader macro headwinds, BTC continues to attract buyers during dips, underscoring its role as a perceived hedge amid rising uncertainty. Technical Analysis Highlights BTC traded within a $1,288 range (1.22%) between a low of $105,043.65 and a 24-hour high of $106,332. Resistance around $105,900–$106,100 was broken as price surged beyond this zone with strong volume during the early afternoon. Support at $105,400 held firm through several retests, reinforcing bullish sentiment. A breakout to $106,332 occurred around 13:48, followed by minor profit-taking and stabilization above $106,000. The hourly chart shows an ascending trend with consistent higher lows, invalidating the earlier ""pump and dump"" interpretation. With momentum intact, BTC may test the $107,000 resistance level if current support near $105,800 holds.

2025-06-08T18:11:09,"Experienced Analyst Reveals 4 Essential Conditions for the Mega Altcoin Season","Cryptocurrency analyst Miles Deutscher made a remarkable assessment about the altcoin season, which altcoin investors are eagerly awaiting, in his latest statement. Deutscher, who claimed that he could predict when the altcoin season would start thanks to the artificial intelligence model he developed, stated that he tested this model by comparing it with previous cycles and that the results were “surprising.” Deutscher recalled that the altcoin seasons in 2017 and 2021 offered increases of 1,000% to 10,000%, and said that such major movements have not yet been seen in the current cycle. He noted that apart from the partial increases experienced in April and November-December of last year, major altcoins generally performed poorly against Bitcoin. According to the analyst, there are several key reasons why this cycle is different from previous periods: Macroeconomic Conditions: While the pandemic-induced stimulus packages in the 2020-2021 period provided serious liquidity to the crypto market, this situation has been reversed in the current environment with the FED's balance sheet reduction policies. Institutional Bitcoin Investments: Bitcoin ETFs and the entry of giants like BlackRock are keeping capital in Bitcoin, which is leading to a weakening of the “capital flow from Bitcoin to altcoins” effect seen in previous cycles. Ethereum’s Weak Performance: Ethereum’s failure to make a strong breakout against Bitcoin is preventing the start of a large-scale altcoin rally. Low Individual Interest: Scandals such as UST, FTX and the losses experienced in the recent memecoin frenzy caused individual investors to move away from the market. Related News: Crypto Users Beware: Hackers' New Methods Have Emerged - What Steps Are Necessary to Prevent the Loss of All Assets? Miles Deutscher stated that the model called Altcoin Rally Score (ARS), which he developed by taking this data into account, consists of four basic indicators that will trigger the altcoin season: Bitcoin Dominance: Bitcoin dominance must fall below 60% and show a decline of 4 points in the 21-day period. Ethereum's Leadership: The ETH/BTC ratio must break above the 200-day moving average and make a new 90-day high. Altcoin Seasonal Index: If this index rises above 40 and rises for two consecutive weeks, it will indicate a broad-based rally. Trends and Individual Interest: Market sentiment, trend momentum, and stablecoin liquidity should show a positive trend. Deutscher predicts that the new altcoin season, which he defines as 3.0, will be shorter and more selective (sector-based) than previous cycles. He cited both the global liquidity crunch and the fact that the supply of newly released altcoins is much higher than in previous years as the main reasons for this. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-08T18:00:16,"Bitcoin (BTC) Can’t Break Out, Meanwhile This AI Project Is Quietly Making Its Holders Rich","Bitcoin, the king of cryptocurrencies, is showing signs of fatigue. Despite its iconic status, Bitcoin is struggling to break out of its current price stagnation. Meanwhile, a promising new project, Ruvi AI , is quietly making its early investors wealthier by the day. This AI-driven blockchain project is combining innovation with real-world utility, creating a unique opportunity for those seeking high return on investment. Here’s why Ruvi AI is emerging as a standout in the crypto space. Bitcoin’s Stagnation Leaves Investors Frustrated Bitcoin’s dominance in the crypto market remains undeniable, but it’s no longer the profit powerhouse it used to be. Recent months have seen Bitcoin moving sideways, caught between resistance levels and market indecision. While still a reliable store of value, Bitcoin’s price action lacks the dramatic momentum that attracted speculative investors in the past. For those looking for explosive growth, this lack of movement is a signal to explore emerging projects. Ruvi AI’s Explosive Presale Offers Unmatched Growth Potential Enter Ruvi AI , a project at the intersection of blockchain and artificial intelligence . Unlike Bitcoin, Ruvi AI is in its early stages, offering significant room for growth. The ongoing presale has already raised an impressive $1.5 million , with almost 135 million tokens sold . Priced at just $0.015 per token during Phase 2, Ruvi AI represents an enticing entry point for investors looking for outsized returns. What makes Ruvi AI particularly exciting is its structured valuation. Unlike speculative price predictions, its planned $0.07 valuation post-presale is a clear feature of the project roadmap. Additionally, analysts forecast a $1 valuation post-listing , ensuring that investors can see the potential for substantial upside before the year is out. Real-World Applications That Set Ruvi AI Apart While Bitcoin’s utility is primarily focused on its use as a decentralized currency, Ruvi AI offers real-world applications that solve immediate problems. This focus makes the project not only a compelling investment but also a viable solution for industries in need of disruption. Healthcare : Ruvi AI improves patient care by enabling faster, more accurate diagnostics and streamlining medical processes. Logistics : The platform optimizes supply chain management, reducing costs and increasing operational efficiency for businesses. Finance : Ruvi AI enhances fraud detection while safeguarding transactions, introducing new levels of trust and reliability to financial ecosystems. This practical utility ensures that Ruvi AI is positioned for widespread adoption across industries, giving it a competitive edge over stagnating projects focused on abstract goals. VIP Investment Tiers Offer Outstanding Returns Ruvi AI’s presale doesn’t just promise growth; it rewards early adopters with its lucrative VIP investment tier system . This tiered structure offers generous token bonuses, maximizing returns for those who commit early to the project. Here’s a detailed look at how the tiers work: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900 . Value at $1 per token: $70,000 . VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680 . Value at $1 per token: $224,000 . VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600 . Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000 . This reward structure demonstrates Ruvi AI’s commitment to making its early investors a top priority, solidifying its reputation as a high-potential project. Why Ruvi AI Is Quietly Leading the Way For investors seeking profit potential that Bitcoin can no longer deliver, Ruvi AI is the project to watch. Its explosive presale, combined with its focus on solving real-world problems, positions it as a standout in a crowded market. Ruvi AI is more than just another cryptocurrency; it’s a platform built with scalability and practical impact in mind.

2025-06-08T18:00:00,"Top cryptocurrencies to watch this week: Flare, Aptos, Pi Network","Cryptocurrency prices retreated last week as investors locked profits, Bitcoin ( BTC ) and most altcoins will likely react to the upcoming U.S. consumer inflation data, which will impact the next action by the Federal Reserve. A lower-than-expected inflation figure could pressure the bank to cut interest rates. Some of the top coins to watch will be Flare ( FLR ), Aptos ( APT ), and Pi Network ( PI ). Flare Flare is a fast-growing layer-1 network whose token is valued at over $1 billion. It will be in the spotlight this week as it unlocks tokens worth over $35 million on Monday. In addition, its ecosystem is experiencing strong growth, with the total value locked at $188 million, up from $51 million in January. Also, its stablecoin market cap has jumped to $150 million from $5.2 million in May. The daily chart shows that the FLR token has pulled back in the past few weeks, moving from a high of $0.02220, to $0.018. It has formed a falling wedge, a popular bullish reversal sign. Therefore, it will likely have a bullish breakout, with the target being at $0.0220. Flare price chart | Source: crypto.news Aptos Aptos, a top layer-1 blockchain network, will be in focus this week as it unlocks tokens worth $53 million, equivalent to 1.8% of its float. Also, the market cap of all stablecoins in the network has jumped to a record high of $1.32 billion. APT token has been in a strong downtrend in the past few days, forming a descending channel. It has moved below the 50-day Exponential Moving Average, while the MACD and the Relative Strength Index have moved downwards. Aptos token will likely remain in this range, and possibly bounce back to the upper side of the range at $6. A drop below the lower side of the channel will point to further downside to $3.5. You might also like: Flipping Uniswap, Flopping on Price: PancakeSwap Paradox Aptos price chart | Source: crypto.news Pi Network The Pi Network token will be watched this week for two reasons. First, the network will continue unlocking over 68 million tokens this week, increasing the number in circulation. Second, the token has formed a slanted triple-bottom pattern and a bullish divergence pattern on the eight-hour chart. These patterns are often followed by a bullish breakout, which may happen this week. Pi coin price chart | Source: crypto.new Other crypto tokens to watch this week Other top tokens to watch this week will be Ethereum ( ETH ), Kekius Maximus, and Official Trump ( TRUMP ). Ethereum will be in the spotlight because it has formed a bullish flag and a golden cross, pointing to a rebound.

Circle stock surged 167% in its NYSE debut on June 5, re-igniting comparisons between the two stablecoin giants. $515 Billion? “A Bit Bearish,” Says Ardoino Ardoino’s comments followed a bold valuation estimate by Artmesis CEO Jon Ma, who claimed Tether could be worth $515 billion if it went public—ranking it among the world’s 20 largest companies. While he called the figure a “beautiful number,” Ardoino suggested it might actually be too conservative. “Maybe a bit bearish considering our current (and increasing) Bitcoin + gold treasury, yet I’m very humbled,” he said. Key Bitcoin influencers like Anthony Pompliano and Jack Mallers believe Tether can potentially reach a $1 trillion valuation. Strategic Investments Reflects Long-Term Vision Tether’s USDT is currently the third-largest crypto by market cap at $154.83 billion. The company has been aggressively expanding into Bitcoin holdings and infrastructure. On April 24, Tether acquired a majority stake in Twenty One Capital, a Bitcoin treasury firm founded by Strike CEO Jack Mallers. The firm, newly formed as it is, is now the world’s third-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, ranking behind Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and MARA Holdings. Billions in Bitcoin on the Move On June 3, Tether transferred over 37,229 Bitcoin—worth approximately $3.9 billion—into addresses tied to the new Bitcoin-native financial platform. The moves illustrate the company’s long-term bitcoin optimism and its strategy of building value off the traditional public market path. “I’m very excited about the next stage of growth of our company,” Ardoino added.",btcpulse,https://btc-pulse.com/tether-ceo-dismisses-ipo-says-515b-valuation-may/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|USDT","Blockchain|Tether",cryptocompare

It’s the first time this wallet has shown activity in two years. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Hit $180,000 In 2025? Analyst Highlights The Trigger The purchase has stirred talk among traders and on-chain analysts alike. Some see it as a sign that big players are getting ready for more action in the weeks ahead. Whale Returns After Two Years According to Lookonchain data, the same whale pulled 500 BTC out of Gemini back in 2022 when Bitcoin was trading near $27,400, a move worth nearly $14 million at the time. Now, with BTC hovering around $105,000, the whale’s holdings sit on an unrealized gain of over $39 million. That kind of profit margin grabs attention. Other large holders often watch these moves closely. They wonder if this is the start of a wider trend or just one wallet’s play. A whale that had been dormant for 2 years bought another 250 $BTC($26.37M) 9 hours ago. 2 years ago, this whale withdrew 500 $BTC($13.7M) from Gemini at $27,401, now sitting on an unrealized profit of $39M.https://t.co/c0U92isSfc pic.twitter.com/vcb4V3M0Uz — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 8, 2025 Big Gains On Early Bet Early adopters have seen massive upside in Bitcoin over the years. This whale’s 2022 withdrawal came just before a multi-year price boom. Since then, Bitcoin has climbed nearly 300%. Not everyone can make moves like that. Small investors often feel left behind when a wallet this size shifts coins. Still, some traders say it can create a ripple of optimism. When big holders buy, retail traders sometimes pile in, chasing the same gains. Technical Indicators Show Mixed Signals On the charts, BTC seems to be shaping an inverse cup-and-handle pattern with a significant neckline at $100,800 serving as major support. The price has fallen into the handle stage, and a dip below $100,800 could propel Bitcoin to $91,000, which coincides with its 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). Bitcoin’s relative strength index (RSI) is 52, indicating the bullish momentum is fading. A fall below 50 could introduce additional selling pressure. For the bulls to regain control, BTC must recapture the 20-day EMA resistance, which is just above $105,000.

In an interview during the Bloomberg Tech Summit in San Francisco, Khosrowshahi says that Uber is looking at the use cases for stablecoins – cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to other assets such as the US dollar. “We’re still in the study phase, but I think stablecoin is one of the, for me, more interesting instantiations of crypto that has a practical benefit other than crypto as a store of value. Obviously, you can have your opinions on Bitcoin, but it’s a proven commodity, and people have different opinions on where it’s going.” One stablecoin use case that Khosrowshahi believes could benefit Uber and other companies is its potential to reduce the costs associated with transferring money internationally. “I do think that stablecoin is quite promising, especially for global companies that are moving money around globally to create a mechanism for us to essentially reduce costs in terms of moving money internationally. So that’s super interesting to us. And we’re definitely going to take a look.” Khosrowshani’s statements come following stablecoin giant Circle’s debut as a public company on Thursday. The USDC and Euro Coin ( EURC ) issuer is now listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol CRCL.

Notably, prominent cryptocurrency personalities are highlighting the many ways in which the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin could benefit from any future meltdown recorded in the global finance market as a result of the increasing national debt in the United States. According to data from USAfacts , the federal debt as of April 2025 is $36.2 trillion, marking a 2% increase from April 2024 and a 31% increase from 2019. In response to the newly released data, Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, took to X to share his prediction for the near future. The crypto founder explained the need for the U.S. electorate to persuade the U.S. Congress to decrease the federal government’s spending. Convinced that Bitcoin could go on to replace the U.S. dollar as a national reserve currency if the national deficit continues to skyrocket, Brian Armstrong wrote; “If the electorate doesn’t hold Congress accountable to reducing the deficit and start paying down the debt, Bitcoin is going to take over as a reserve currency.” Armstrong, whose cryptocurrency exchange—the largest in the country—is bound to benefit from the U.S. government’s adoption of Bitcoin, emphasized the need for stability, suggesting that Bitcoin might not yet be fit to replace the U.S. dollar as national reserve currency. “I love Bitcoin, but a strong America is also super important for the world. We need to get our finances under control.” He added . While Bitcoin might not be replacing the U.S. dollar in the U.S. central bank as a currency held in the largest quantity, President Trump’s executive order for the “Establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile,” will allow the Federal government to manage the cryptocurrency as a U.S. reserve asset.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-ceos-bold-prediction-bitcoin-set-to-replace-dollar-as-reserve-currency-amid-36-2t-debt-crisis/,"BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|SPONSORED","Bitcoin|Featured|News|Bitcoin News|Brian Armstrong|Coinbase|USA",cryptocompare

The City of Richmond, Virginia says it will provide a one-time housing assistance grant of $1,200 to each of the successful applicants of the RVA Stay Gap Grant Program. According to the city, $3.9 million is available for the program and the grants will be handed out on a “first come, first serve basis.” Applicants of the RVA Stay Gap Grant Program must be residents of the City of Richmond and must prove that their annual housing costs are equal to or more than 30% of their total household income to qualify. Applicants must also be in the bottom 80% of the low-income category and must not be receiving other forms of housing assistance from the City of Richmond. If the applicant is a renter, they must possess a current lease bearing their name. If a homeowner, they must possess a current mortgage with their name on it. “Renter annual housing costs may include rent, tenant renter’s insurance for personal property, and utility costs. Owner annual housing costs may include mortgage payments and utility costs.” For successful applicants who are homeowners, the grant will first go towards paying their real estate taxes and the balance will then be sent to them in a check. In the case of successful applicants who are renters, the entire grant of $1,200 will be sent to their landlord. The deadline for applications is December 31st. Applicants will be notified within eight weeks whether they have been accepted or rejected for the City of Richmond’s RVA Stay Gap Grant Program.

GameStop stock ended the week at $29.58, down 16% from its highest point this year. Its market capitalization is over $13 billion. Wall Street analysts expect the company’s core business results to show sustained weakness as more customers pivot towards online games. Data compiled by Yahoo Finance show that revenue will be $754 million, down by 14.47% from the same period last year. Analysts also expect its guidance for the second quarter to be $748 million, down 6.28% year over year. The estimate for its annual revenue is $3.56 billion and $3.13 billion next year. These numbers will represent a continuation of what has been happening. GameStop’s annual revenue moved from $6 billion in 2022 to $5.27 billion in 2023 and $3.8 billion last year.

This explains why the company decided to emulate Strategy, a company whose valuation has jumped to over $100 billion because of its Bitcoin ( BTC ) holdings. GameStop has become one of the biggest Bitcoin holders. It holds 4,710 coins valued at over $497 million, and the management hopes to continue purchasing. GameStop has room to boost its Bitcoin holdings because of its strong balance sheet. It ended the last quarter with over $4.7 billion in cash, short-term investments, and no debt. Its equity valuation of over $13 billion also gives itthe flexibility to sell shares to fund these purchases. The company’s Bitcoin holdings to market cap are 3.76% (in contrast, Michael Saylor’s Strategy is 58%). GME stock price analysis GameStop stock chart | Source: TradingView The daily chart shows that the GME share price has retreated since it started implementing its Bitcoin strategy. It moved from $35 in May to $29.58. This price is inside the ascending channel connecting the highest and lowest swings since May last year. The stock remains above the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, a bullish thing. GME stock’s outlook is neutral ahead of its first quarter fiscal 2025 results, set to be released after the market closes on Tuesday, June 10. The key levels to watch will be the psychological point at $20 and the resistance point at $35.78.

2025-06-08T15:30:13,"Bitcoin Leveraged Traders Are Back Betting On A Price Decline — What This Means","The price of Bitcoin has been in a good recovery form since succumbing to the bearish pressure from the ongoing feud between United States President Donald Trump and Elon Musk. The premier cryptocurrency climbed above the $105,000 mark in the early hours of Saturday, June 7. According to the latest on-chain data, the Bitcoin price looks set to continue its upward trajectory over the next few days. What Negative Leveraged Traders’ Sentiment Means For Price In a new post on the X platform, data analytics firm Alphractal shared fresh on-chain insights into the recent movement of the Bitcoin price. According to the market intelligence firm, the major catalyst of BTC’s latest recovery is the sudden shift in the market sentiment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Golden Cross Pattern Says The Crash To $100,000 Is Normal – What To Expect Next This on-chain observation is based on the Leveraged Traders’ Sentiment, which tracks the outlook or positioning of leveraged traders in the market. It provides insight into the kind of bets (longs or shorts) that leveraged traders are placing in the crypto market and the funding rates of the derivatives market. Data from Alphractal shows a rising interest in opening short positions in the Bitcoin market, with most retail traders betting on a price decline. Ultimately, this on-chain trend suggests that the sentiment in the Bitcoin derivatives market is currently bearish. However, Alphractal noted that this kind of behavior might not be as straightforward as it looks, as the market historically tends to move in the crowd’s opposite direction. Hence, when several traders are betting on a Bitcoin price decline, the flagship cryptocurrency tends to witness a contrasting market bounce. Alphractal said: When sentiment becomes excessively bullish or bearish, the market tends to do the opposite. Therefore, this metric is not just a sentiment gauge — it’s also a warning signal for potential contrarian moves that often catch traders off guard. According to the analytics firm, this is exactly what is currently happening in the Bitcoin market, with the market leader bouncing back despite the negative traders’ sentiment. Interestingly, if these leveraged traders continue to bet against Bitcoin, the BTC price could potentially ride this fresh bullish momentum to a new all-time high. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, BTC is valued at around $105,700, reflecting an almost 2% increase in the past 24 hours. Following the latest resurgence, the premier cryptocurrency is now up by more than 1% on the weekly timeframe.

2025-06-08T15:22:00,"Under-the-radar Mutuum Finance crypto project expected to cross $2 mark","The crypto market has recently witnessed a massive surge, with the price of Bitcoin (BTC) recently surging to a new all-time high above $110k. The surge led to many flashy headlines, with many newbie investors joining Bitcoin (BTC) near the top. However, seasoned investors know the best entry point into the crypto market is to find projects bursting at the seams with potential like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) before they make the headlines. Let us take a closer look at Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and why analysts are so excited about its future. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is poised for huge gains Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the most exciting crypto projects in a long time. It represents shifting investor interest from meme coins to projects that offer long-term value to their community. The project, which is built as a decentralized non-custodial protocol, allows users to participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. As a lender, users have a chance to earn interest on their idle assets by depositing them in a pool. The interest earned is determined by the pool’s utilization rate and can quickly add up based on the asset type and the demand from borrowers. To ensure the long-term solvency of the platform, Mutuum Finance has introduced several notable technical innovations. Thoughtful asset integration process The crypto market is massive, and crypto assets come in all different flavors. Mutuum Finance aims to ensure that users of the platform have the best options possible. In line with this philosophy, the team has a long list of metrics that it uses to determine if an asset should be added to the platform. These checks include: Transaction costs Each asset added to the protocol introduces a new level of code complexity, which pushes up the gas fee. The goal of Mutuum Finance is to strike a balance between offering users as many options as possible while keeping costs as low as possible. Volatility and liquidity Assets with high volatility and low liquidity could potentially impact the solvency of the protocol. To avoid this issue, Mutuum Finance will conduct an in-depth assessment to determine the suitability. Based on the assessment, some tokens may be added in an isolated or restricted model. By vigorously checking tokens and creating specialized frameworks for some tokens, they ensure that users have access to a diverse list of assets while still protecting the protocol’s solvency. Centralization check Mutuum Finance will check whether an asset has issues with centralization before it is added. Assets that are under the control of a single entity could potentially be shut down at a moment’s notice, impacting the overall stability of the protocol. Before adding a token, the team will weigh user demand compared to the overall solvency of the protocol. Oracle manipulation checks The Mutuum Finance project will also add safeguards against oracle manipulation. If a digital asset is found to have an unreliable price oracle, it may be accepted, but with massive restrictions. For instance, it could be placed in non-collateral status. Limiting how such an asset can be used ensures there is a safeguard against exploits that rely on sudden price changes. When an asset is restricted from being used as collateral, its impact on solvency is more limited. The reason for this is that collateral represents the protocol’s assets. As such, those holding the assets must over-collateralize their position to maintain solvency. If an asset is restricted from being used as collateral, the position needs to be excessively backed by high-quality assets. Once assets are accepted on the platform, various metrics will be used to monitor them, such as liquidation thresholds, loan-to-value, and liquidation bonuses. These metrics can be tweaked to ensure that a token does not impact the solvency of the protocol when market dynamics change. MUTM presale performance Based on the technical ingenuity in creating the Mutuum Finance project, the MUTM token presale has attracted overwhelming support. So far, over $10.1 million has been raised. So far, over 11,700 unique buyers have secured their tokens and are looking forward to the listing, when their value could explode 10x or more. The presale is in phase 5, where tokens are going for $0.03. In Phase 4, the token price was $0.025 and has since increased by 20%. The price is set to increase 16.67% to $0.035. This stepped increase ensures that the earliest supporters will enjoy the greatest benefits. Do not let this opportunity pass you by. With a planned listing price of $0.06, current participants in the Phase 5 presale stand to make a 100% ROI when the tokens are listed. Analysts predict that the price could rise to as high as $2 once the tokens go live.

2025-06-08T14:58:00,"Bitcoin Family Hides Crypto Seed Phrases Across Four Continents After Kidnapping Threats","Key Takeaways: The Bitcoin Family now hides their crypto seed phrases across four continents amid growing kidnapping threats. Recent violent attacks on crypto holders have triggered new personal security measures in the industry. Crypto executives are increasingly hiring private security. A wave of violent kidnappings targeting cryptocurrency holders is pushing some of the industry’s most well-known figures to overhaul their security — including Didi Taihuttu, patriarch of the so-called “Bitcoin Family.” Taihuttu, who famously sold everything in 2017 to go all-in on Bitcoin, revealed that his family has abandoned hardware wallets and now hides their crypto seed phrases across four continents. The shift follows a string of threats and rising attacks on crypto holders worldwide. Even at Gunpoint Attackers Would Get Little “We have changed everything,” Taihuttu told CNBC from Thailand . “Even if someone held me at gunpoint, I can’t give them more than what’s on my phone wallet — and that’s not much.” Over the past eight months, the family moved to a hybrid system: seed phrases are encrypted, split, and stored in both physical and digital formats. Some parts are etched onto fireproof steel plates hidden across four continents. Others are stored via blockchain-based encryption services. “You only need to remember which words you changed,” Taihuttu explained. The system ensures that even if attackers access part of the seed phrase, they cannot unlock the family’s full holdings. The decision comes as physical attacks on crypto holders increase. Moroccan police this week arrested a suspect accused of kidnapping crypto executives. In France, the father of a crypto millionaire was brutally attacked . And in New York, a tourist was tortured for over two weeks as kidnappers tried to extract his Bitcoin credentials. Three British men kidnapped a UK crypto trader in Spain Demanding a €30K ransom. The victim managed to call a friend, who alerted the police Leading to a dramatic rescue. (5/9) pic.twitter.com/8B7OqwnIta — StarPlatinum (@StarPlatinumSOL) May 13, 2025 The Taihuttus, who remain entirely unbanked and travel full-time with their three daughters, say they are rethinking even their public presence. After strangers tracked their residence through YouTube videos, they stopped posting travel updates and moved homes. “We got a little bit famous in a niche market — but that niche is becoming a big market now,” Taihuttu said, noting the family has decided to avoid traveling to France altogether. About 65% of their crypto is now locked in cold storage across four continents. The rest remains in multi-signature wallets or decentralized exchanges for trading and daily spending. Taihuttu said they avoid centralized vaults and services, preferring to retain full control. “What happens if one of those companies goes bankrupt? You’re putting your capital back in someone else’s hands,” he said. Crypto Executives Hire Bodyguards As reported, crypto executives are turning to personal security services as targeted kidnappings and ransom attempts continue to escalate, particularly in France. In May, private security firms such as Infinite Risks International, based in Amsterdam, reported a sharp increase in demand from crypto professionals seeking round-the-clock protection amid rising crypto kidnapping. The rise in inquiries came a after spate of violent attacks, including multiple kidnappings attempts that have alarmed both investors and law enforcement.

2025-06-08T14:53:45,"Trump Media Commits 3 Billion Dollars to Crypto in One Bold Move","Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) is reportedly planning to raise $3 billion to invest in cryptocurrencies, predominantly Bitcoin. The firm is the parent company of the social media platform Truth Social. This decision has sent ripples through the finance and crypto worlds, with many seeing it as a step to show confidence in crypto growth. The investment will comprise $2 billion in equity and $1 billion in convertible bonds. This investment is poised to be announced at the Bitcoin 2025 event in Las Vegas. TMTG joins a growing list of public companies that are looking to diversify into digital assets. However, some see this as a conflict of interest given the latest stance on crypto by the Trump administration. A Strategic Shift into Crypto TMTG has initially indicated that it would be launching its own crypto services called Truth.Fi. This was to be a financial service and FinTech brand aimed at integrating digital assets and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) into its portfolio. The firm has already partnered with Crypto.com with an aim to develop ETFs that are focused on Bitcoin and other digital assets. The firm aims to be one of the serious contenders in the crypto economy. With the $3 billion rise in investments, the company will raise its capacity to acquire substantial crypto holdings. This follows the strategy of MicroStrategy, which has so far amassed over $62 billion in Bitcoin through various equity and debt issuances. Growing Interest in Cryptos The company is eyeing the potential growth in cryptos across several markets around the world. Bitcoin and other cryptos have seen a resurgence in interest, with merchants, top-rated crypto casino list options such as those on Casino.Guide, and casual users on the internet using them for their daily transactions. There has also been rising pro-crypto sentiment with the Trump administration. In fact, Vice President JD Vance and Donald Trump’s sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, are expected to speak at the Bitcoin 2025 event in Las Vegas, a move that will amplify its visibility. Other high-profile names like David Sacks, the administration’s unofficial ‘crypto czar,’ will be at the event. The firm will be looking to enhance its profile among the serious contenders in the crypto world. The Trump Administration is Crypto-friendly The Trump administration has been the catalyst for big cryptocurrency moves by companies across the country. The president was once a skeptic that called Bitcoin a scam. However, he changed his stance during his 2024 campaign and is promising to create a national cryptocurrency stockpile. The stance toward cryptocurrency has also changed. For example, he made an executive order to establish a crypto working group to enhance the growth of crypto in the country. Consequently, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has also been withdrawing investigations into major crypto firms, something that has fostered a conducive environment for investments. There is a growing list of corporations that are holding cryptocurrencies as treasury assets. Companies like Enlivex Therapeutics and Acurx Pharmaceuticals have recently allocated portions of their cash reserves to Bitcoin. Many are viewing it as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. Since the current landscape is filled with fiscal concerns and geopolitical risks, this playbook provides a shift from traditional assets. Risks and Controversies The company’s plans have attracted scrutiny from government ethics and regulatory authorities, particularly due to its ties to President Trump and his family. Additionally, TMTG’s aggressive push into crypto comes at a time when the industry remains vulnerable to hacks and volatility. In 2024, cryptocurrency platforms lost $2.2 billion to hacks . One of the decentralized finances (DeFi) platforms, Dough Finance, which was linked to TMTG, was susceptible. This firm collapsed after the hack, and there have been ongoing lawsuits alleging fraud. TMTG has also had a rather rough financial standing in the recent past. It reported a $19 million loss in the third quarter of 2024. This was driven by legal fees and costs tied to its streaming platform, Truth+ Streaming. The firm has a valuation of about $6 billion as of May 2025 but seeks to issue shares at market price, something that could dilute investor confidence. Effect on the Market Following the announcement, TMTG’s stock surged 4.64% to $25.72 following the news. Bitcoin itself saw a 1.5% gain, which is the largest growth in four days. This is a signal of the market optimism towards the firm’s entry into the space. The prospects of the crypto market growing are very real, with many predicting that it will remain bullish into the foreseeable future. However, there has not been regulatory clarity despite the positive posture by the government. When this is in place, we expect better returns on crypto investments.

2025-06-08T14:38:44,"Wynn expects CZ to win unless Hyperliquid ‘levels up’","In a post on X (formerly Twitter), James Wynn, the popular high-volume trader on the decentralized exchange Hyperliquid, publicly criticized the platform’s referral incentives and warned that its days could be numbered if it fails to evolve. His comments come amid rising anticipation for a new decentralized exchange (DEX) being developed by Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, one that promises to shield large traders from front-running and liquidation risks. Wynn wrote in his post that he hasn’t been paid a single cent by Hyperliquid. He stated, “I reached out on two occasions hoping to get some kind of partnership deal for all of the attention I was bringing them, and although they seemed thankful, they don’t offer such deals to anyone.” Though Wynn acknowledges Hyperliquid’s decentralized nature may explain its lack of traditional sponsorship structures, his frustration was clear. Despite generating high traffic and trading volume for the platform, Wynn claims to have made only $34,000 through referrals, an amount he describes as “extremely poor” given the scale of his influence. Wynn also criticized Hyperliquid’s referral program stating that the program sucks. He went on to state that other platforms have far better referral programs The liquidations that possibly sparked the outburst Wynn’s comments follow major and publicly chronicled liquidations on the Hyperliquid DEX. In one of the largest capitulations in late May, his massive long position, reportedly worth over $1.1 billion in Bitcoin, was liquidated to the tune of $100 million in full view of the market after Bitcoin fell below $105,000. The visibility of his open position raised suspicions that he may have been “hunted” by other traders who took advantage of the transparent order book, a controversial feature in decentralized finance. The incident sparked debate across crypto Twitter, leading to questions about the current DEX designs and how they expose large traders to manipulation. Wynn’s post seemed to echo the pain of that event and pointed squarely to what he sees as the solution: a new kind of DEX that keeps large trades private. CZ’s dark pool DEX enters the mix Wynn’s warning to Hyperliquid comes just as CZ, the founder of Binance, is preparing to launch a new “dark pool” Perpetuals DEX. According to CZ, this new platform will allow users to deposit assets on-chain but place orders privately, a model designed to prevent front-running, MEV (miner extractable value), and liquidation attacks. CZ stated in his post on X , “If you are looking to purchase $1 billion worth of tokens, you generally wouldn’t want others to notice your order until it’s completed.” While details remain scarce, the project is already being touted as a potential game-changer for DeFi. Wynn expects CZ to win unless Hyperliquid ‘levels up’ In his critique, Wynn clarified that he sees CZ’s entry into the DEX market as a serious threat to current players. “When CZ launches a dark pool perps DEX, it will put an end to HyperLiquid,” he warned. “CZ has the money, network, and teams to build something like no other. Look at what he’s done with Binance.” While this may seem like an endorsement of CZ’s new venture, it’s also a call to arms for Hyperliquid, a signal that the platform must improve not only its incentive structure but also its technical architecture if it wants to retain its user base. Wynn stated, “I hope this encourages HyperLiquid to level up… as they’ll soon be outweighed by better competition.” Hyperliquid has a strong lead in the perpetual DEX market. Source: Coinmarketcap For now, Hyperliquid remains the runaway leader in the perpetual DEX market, maintaining an almost upward-only trajectory since it launched. It holds a dominant 62% of the market share, with Aster as the closest competitor with about 27%. Hyperliquid also processed about $2.57B in the last 24 hours, more than double Aster’s $1.12B.

The deceptive pop-up message claimed the 73 year-old woman’s device was infected, including a fake Apple Care phone number for her to call, reports Columbus County News. When she dialed the number, scammers posing as Apple Care representatives said her computer and bank accounts were compromised. They then pretended to transfer her to Wells Fargo’s fraud department.
