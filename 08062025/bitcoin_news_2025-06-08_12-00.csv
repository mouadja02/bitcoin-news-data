2025-06-08T09:47:57,"AI could destroy crypto within five years | Opinion","Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. AI has been evolving at breakneck speed and is becoming an indispensable and useful tool across many industries for business and consumer-facing functions, including the finance industry. The fast adoption of AI is largely driven by its low barriers to entry, where anyone with a computer and internet connection can interact with AI and develop it. Yet, as AI grows, it brings severe risks: AI is already sufficiently advanced to assist human-led hacking through LLMs and AI agents. You might also like: AI is crypto’s redemption, and the next generation’s big bet | Opinion Within five years, AI will develop capabilities to hack on another, far more dangerous front: through Artificial General Intelligence. Once AGI is achieved, it won’t be controlled by people. Unless governments and regulators step in now (even then, the chances of controlling it are slim), AGI will escape the confines of its creators and autonomously hack cryptocurrency encryptions… and entire global digital systems. The rise of artificial intelligence AI has seen a dramatic surge in the commercial arena, one of its most recent iterations being AI agents. These are finely tuned, complicated systems, geared to perform specialized tasks and make decisions with minimal human intervention. Already transforming the tech space and becoming a useful everyday tool for many basic human interactions, such as self-driving cars, fraud detection , on-chain trading, and application creation. The next evolution will be AGI , a complex system that can do everything a human can. It will not need human prompts or intervention; it will simply have real-time autonomy: the ability to perform tasks, but also recognise when a task needs performing. This is set to be achieved in the next two years. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Elon Musk have made public statements declaring clear roadmaps to achieve AGI; regardless of who gets there first, time will decide whether they are a hero or the destroyers of worlds. Potential evolution of use cases: Friend and foe Alongside positive innovations, AI is facilitating amoral actors. LLMs and AI agents are being used to assist hacking. LLMs get jailbroken to produce malware and are being used for targeted scamming, such as faking voices in phone calls to incite money transfers from unsuspecting victims. An open-sourced AI Agent can be used by malicious actors for targeted scams, tasked with finding, tracking, tracing, and infiltrating a target—never ending until it achieves its goal. One key vulnerability on the horizon lies in the potential for AGI to break cryptographic encryptions. Bitcoin ( BTC ) encryption hacking is already a growing market, but is currently limited to the realm of quantum computing , which has an incredibly high barrier to entry—it requires extreme assets, resources, and technical capabilities that the average hacker does not possess. Crypto encryption hacking has been limited to a small handful of individuals who are legally paying for the services of quantum computing firms to unlock their wallets and recover funds for a hefty finder’s fee. Encryption hacking will not always be bound to the limits of quantum computing. AGI presents much lower barriers to entry and will leverage technology that man has not even yet discovered. AI + bad actors = death of crypto Once AI has advanced to the point where it can hack encryption, the level of criminals using this tool will dramatically increase. Usage will extend well beyond innocent crypto investors trying to recover funds. Hackers will use AI agents sufficiently advanced to target and exploit these weaknesses in our financial systems. Particularly as there are many amoral groups that lack quantum computing skills, actively interested in the weaponisation of AI, for example, the North Korean Lazarus Group, infamous for financial hacks , poses a real danger. We are looking at far more devastating effects than just scams and theft. North Korea will use it as a digital weapon, destroying existing financial systems. Beyond the weaponisation of AI by unfriendly states and actors lies the potential for AGI to go rogue from its creators. Once this happens, one of the first aspects after decentralizing itself, through infiltrating digital networks to become untraceable to avoid being switched off, will be to gather financial resources. The most likely target is the financial markets, specifically crypto. It would try to access digital capital by tracking high-frequency traders, forging accounts, and hacking online bank accounts. It would also break encryption methods for Bitcoin and all major cryptocurrencies. In the blink of an eye, it will be able to hack every single wallet that has ever existed and immediately secure the assets by selling them on the chain for gold, bonds, and fiat currencies, all before any centralised authority could respond. If an AI can crack all the private keys for crypto wallets, why would it not do so within minutes, stealing and selling all of the Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and then diversifying into other assets? It would, and it will. Any hope for crypto (and humankind)? Without proactive counter-strategies, AGI could dismantle cryptocurrencies and very quickly take control of all human finances. As a complex, non-deterministic system, AGI is a technology where the safety rails imposed by governments are most needed; managing these risks requires exceptional cooperation and sophistication across many actors and institutions. Yet this is the first time a world-changing technology has not been spearheaded by the government, but instead by private corporations. From the Manhattan Project to microprocessors, the internet, GPS, and digital cameras, these are all technologies that originated from government-run projects for defense, which were subsequently commercialized for consumers (except for the bomb). Silicon Valley is at the forefront of AI, placing us in a unique position in history where the scale and speed of distribution, versus government oversight, may not be sufficient to prevent major negative impacts. AI will transform society, but once AI proves extremely smart and capable, there will be little to stop the ‘wrong hands’ from developing harmful AI tools. AGI starts a countdown timer until it breaks free from its creator’s chains and moves into the real world. The risks are not exclusive to financial markets, but apply to the whole digital landscape, IoT devices, electrical grids, and so much more. Crypto is but a means to an end for AI, a means to gather wealth. Crypto is purely the financial vessel for the worst-case scenario to unfold.

2025-06-08T09:30:14,"Ethereum Prepares For A Parabolic Move – ETH/BTC Chart Signals Strong Bullish Setup","Ethereum has remained resilient over the past few weeks, holding firmly above key support levels despite a broader market pullback. While many altcoins have struggled to find direction, ETH continues to trade above the $2,500 zone — a level that has repeatedly served as a strong foundation during times of uncertainty. Now, all eyes are on the $2,800 mark, which stands as the critical resistance level that bulls must reclaim to confirm a breakout and reignite bullish momentum. The overall market remains in a wait-and-see mode, with volatility rising and macroeconomic risks clouding short-term confidence. But Ethereum’s structure remains intact, and price action continues to favor accumulation rather than breakdown. Top analyst Carl Runefelt recently shared a bullish outlook on Ethereum’s ETH/BTC pair, highlighting the formation of a textbook bullish pennant. According to his analysis, Ethereum is preparing for a parabolic move once it breaks out of this high-timeframe consolidation. A breakout on the ETH/BTC chart would likely signal altcoin strength across the board, with Ethereum leading the charge. Ethereum Eyes Breakout After Holding Critical Support Ethereum has seen a 14% retrace since the last week of May, but despite the pullback, it continues to hold firmly above the $2,400 support zone — a level that has acted as a floor during the recent correction. While market sentiment has been shaky, Ethereum’s ability to maintain this structure has analysts growing increasingly optimistic. The price action suggests consolidation rather than weakness, with bulls preparing for a potential breakout in the coming sessions. ETH remains down significantly from its yearly highs, but a recovery could be underway. The $2,800 resistance is now the critical barrier for a bullish continuation. Reclaiming that level would confirm a breakout from the current range and open the door to retesting the $3,000–$3,200 region. Some analysts argue that this recovery could mark the start of Ethereum catching up with Bitcoin’s lead, especially if it starts gaining strength in the ETH/BTC pair. Runefelt recently pointed to a bullish pennant forming on the ETH/BTC chart, suggesting that Ethereum may be on the verge of a parabolic move. The key level to watch is around 0.026 BTC. A confirmed breakout above this threshold could signal the start of altseason, as Ethereum tends to lead the way during major altcoin rotations. For now, ETH is at a critical crossroads. Holding above $2,400 gives bulls a strong foundation, but follow-through is needed. A breakout in both USD and BTC pairs would validate the bullish case and likely trigger broader upside across the altcoin market. With momentum building and a technical setup aligning, Ethereum’s next move could shape the market direction well into the summer. ETH Consolidates Below Resistance As Bulls Defend $2,430 Support Ethereum is trading at $2,516 on the daily timeframe, consolidating just below key resistance at the 200-day simple moving average (SMA), currently at $2,663. After a strong rally in May, ETH has entered a sideways range and is now retesting the 34-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $2,431 — a critical level that previously acted as a springboard for the most recent push higher. Despite several attempts, Ethereum has been unable to break above the $2,800 zone, forming a clear horizontal resistance capped by the 200-day SMA. This repeated rejection highlights growing selling pressure at the top of the range. However, the overall structure remains intact as long as ETH holds above $2,430. A daily close below this level could trigger further downside toward the 100-day SMA near $2,266. Volume has declined during this consolidation, suggesting a lack of conviction from both bulls and bears — a setup that typically precedes a breakout. If bulls can reclaim the 200-day SMA, momentum may quickly return, with $2,800 as the next critical breakout level.

2025-06-08T09:30:11,"Ethereum Head & Shoulders Pattern Breakdown: Can Bulls Reclaim Control?","Ethereum’s recent price action on the 4-hour chart has led to the formation of a classic Head and Shoulders pattern that opens up the possibility of a deeper correction. After a relatively stable period around the $2,500 zone, Ethereum broke below a neckline support level as last week drew to a close. This raises the question of whether a bearish continuation is already in motion for the Ethereum price or if bulls still have a shot at regaining momentum in the new week. Related Reading: Elon Musk ‘Will Do Anything’ To Make XRP King, Tech Mogul Says Head & Shoulders Pattern Confirmed After Breakdown Below $2,480 The Head and Shoulders pattern, one of the most recognizable reversal formations in technical analysis, is now clearly visible on Ethereum’s 4-hour candlestick chart. This chart and the technical outlook were first shared on the TradingView platform by crypto analyst MelikaTrader94. The structure includes a left shoulder, a prominent head peaking above $2,700, and a right shoulder that topped near $2,650. The neckline, drawn around $2,480, was breached during Ethereum’s recent pullback to $2,380. This, in turn, shifted the short-term outlook toward the bearish side. After the break, Ethereum attempted to reclaim lost ground and is currently retesting the neckline area. This retest around $2,500 is significant, as a failure to push back above this level significantly would likely validate the bearish setup and cause the Ethereum price to reverse downwards toward the next support zone. According to the outlook from analyst MelikaTrader94, the price target from this Head and Shoulders breakdown before any notable rebound upward can occur lies between $2,200 and $2,250. Chart Image From TradingView: MelikaTrader94 Bulls Must Reclaim $2,650 To Invalidate Bearish Setup A confluence of factors supports the $2,200 region as a likely landing zone. Not only is this level consistent with the measured move of the Head and Shoulders pattern, but it also aligns with an order block on May 9 during Ethereum’s rally above $2,000 at the time. This adds further technical relevance to the $2,200 to $2,250 range acting as a support zone. However, the situation is not fully bearish yet. The path forward is clear but narrow for Ethereum bulls. The first step to invalidate the bearish setup is to reclaim the neckline around $2,500 decisively. Beyond that, breaking back above the right shoulder level around $2,650 would invalidate the Head and Shoulders pattern, and another pattern will most likely come into play.

Analyst Highlights The Trigger A successful bullish reclaim would not only nullify the bearish pattern but could also revive sentiment for another retest of the $2,700 to $2,800 zone, which corresponds to the peak of the head in the recently formed pattern. Until such a recovery occurs, the Ethereum price can quickly reverse downwards at any time. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,510.

Litecoin historic price sentiment Litecoin Price History: Source CoinStats Litecoin traded between $1 and $5 in its early years before surging to over $300 during the crypto bubble of late 2017 to early 2018. In 2021, Litecoin hit an all-time high of $412.96 early in the year but dropped significantly, closing at $144.56 by the end of the year. In 2022, Litecoin experienced significant losses, dropping below $45 mid-year. However, it managed to outperform the broader market despite a nearly 55% decline overall. 2023 saw high volatility for Litecoin, peaking at $114.50 in July but declining sharply due to market pressures, ending the year at $72.80 with a modest 7% rise despite underperforming the broader market. In 2024, Litecoin started the year around $68.20, climbed to $102.40 in April, and then fell below $80. After further declines in May and June, it dropped to $49 in August before rebounding to $70. By November, Litecoin surged past $100 and attempted to hold above $140 in December. In January 2025, the price of Litecoin surged to $140. However, the LTC price crashed in February as it dropped toward the low of $80. In March, the price of LTC consolidated below $90 after failing to break the $100 resistance. By the end of April, LTC price surged toward the $88 but struggled to maintain that level in early May.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/litecoin-price-prediction/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|LTC|MARKET|TRADING","Crypto Price Predictions",cryptocompare
2025-06-08T09:30:00,"Treasuries are stacking Bitcoin: PR gimmick or solid strategy?","As Bitcoin continues its rise into mainstream finance, a growing number of public companies are adding the cryptocurrency to their treasuries — but not without controversy. While firms like MicroStrategy and Metaplanet are going all-in on Bitcoin ( BTC ) accumulation, others are cautiously experimenting, often as a hedge against inflation, rising interest rates, and fiat debasement. Yet critics warn that many of these companies are financially shaky, using the coin more as a speculative lifeline than a strategic asset. Analysts are split between seeing this trend as forward-thinking financial engineering or a “dumpster fire.” The rise of corporate Bitcoin treasuries reflects both the promise and peril of crypto’s expanding influence in global capital markets. According to BitBo , as of June 6, over 70 public companies were holding Bitcoin. It’s understood that companies like Strategy and Metaplanet are fully dedicated to accumulation. However, some other corporations are dipping their toes into Bitcoin stacking while continuing to work in a different sphere. Serious question: How many of these random companies stacking BTC on their balance sheet are just doing it for the PR? — Nic (@nicrypto) June 5, 2025 ‘Dumpster fire in the making’ Journalist and analyst Sean Williams expressed his concerns over the possible failure of the Bitcoin treasury companies, citing the lack of innovation and operational success as the drivers of the potential bust. He called the BTC treasury hype a “dumpster fire in the making.” He pointed out that many companies resorting to launching a BTC treasury are not profitable in the first place, so they try to make quick money out of crypto volatility. This emphasizes their weaknesses. Strategy’s stock performance was one of the worst in February 2025. He named several instances when the BTC price saw significant downfalls as an example of the potential risk for such companies. On top of that, Williams sees the scarcity and 21 million hard cap narratives as “mythical” due to the potential possibility of changing the BTC limit. Technically, it’s not impossible. When BlackRock outlined such a possibility in the company’s educational animation, the reaction from Bitcoin maximalists was antagonistic. Coin Bureau founder Nic Puckrin on X expressed doubts that the “random” companies launching Bitcoin treasuries won’t sell their BTC in the bear market. Thus, he brings up these companies’ alleged superficial engagement in Bitcoin and warns about the potential harm to the crypto market.

While some veterans could get annoyed by seeing their favorite crypto gets “appropriated” by the new players with money, the reasons for adopting corporate Bitcoin treasuries have strong macroeconomic grounds. In an in-depth study , Fidelity analysts note that the last five years saw an increase in publicly traded companies that allocate part of their capital in Bitcoin, which is seen as a hedge against increasing fiscal deficits, fiat currency debasement, and risks associated with geopolitical turbulence. Fidelity emphasizes that this approach is unorthodox for big companies, as in previous decades, they held their funds in low-risk assets, such as bank deposits or treasury bills. According to Fidelity, the growing economic uncertainty undermined trust in traditional strategies. Corporate treasuries’ need for uncorrelated capital grew in the 2020s as interest rates hit high, reducing liquidity and cash flows. However, if the interest rate drops, the yields of companies having substantial reserves of traditional funds will also go down. The study calls the response to COVID-19 “unprecedented” as the cumulative stimulus payments of the biggest economies amounted to $10 trillion, which is three times higher than during the 2008 crisis period. Inflation rates surged, causing a decline in corporate treasuries’ purchasing power. These factors made many investors look for new solutions, and soon many, including public companies, saw a solution in Bitcoin. Given that the regulations in the EU and the U.S. have been Bitcoin-friendly, investors started to accumulate digital assets with more confidence. The study mentions such regulations including: The Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval of Bitcoin ETFs The EU’s MiCA framework adoption The Financial Accounting Standards Board’s rule change from 2023, which allowed Bitcoin holding companies to account for and represent value in their financial statements more precisely. Considering the ascending Bitcoin price, it made companies’ balance sheets look stronger. As Bitcoin has been resistant to demand shocks and could serve as a financial cushion in the long run, it promised benefits for companies adding the coin to their balance sheets. According to Fidelity, Bitcoin can help companies survive the monetary debasement policy of central banks due to its verifiable scarcity. Analysts generally note that Bitcoin’s long-term price appreciation was one of the main reasons for its popularity among corporations. The study names the companies pioneering allocation: The Block, MicroStrategy, Stone Ridge Holdings Group, and Selmer Scientific. ‘Crash test’ FOMO and game theory are often mentioned when people discuss reserves. These reserves cut the live liquidity, increasing an asset’s deficit on the markets while not necessarily pumping the price (as people quickly got used to “bullish” announcements). The trend is pretty young, and it needs to undergo a crash test so we can see if the companies stacking bitcoins are not the “tourists.” You might also like: BlackRock nears Satoshi Nakamoto in Bitcoin, tops Strategy and Binance",crypto_news,https://crypto.news/treasuries-stacking-bitcoin-gimmick-solid-strategy/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Follow-up|BlackRock|education|Fidelity Investments|MicroStrategy",cryptocompare

2025-06-08T09:15:55,"Michael Saylor Doubling Down on Bitcoin Price Prediction As BTC Holds $100,000 Level","The former chief executive of the software firm Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, is doubling down on his massive price prediction for Bitcoin ( BTC ) as it continues to trade above the six-figure level. In a new interview with CNBC Television, Bitcoin firebrand Michael Saylor says that as institutions enter the top crypto asset by market cap, BTC should experience a supply shock and a surge in price. “There’s been a surge of Bitcoin treasury companies. There’s like 100 public companies or more. They’re holding Bitcoin on their balance sheet. And every single week, there’s another announcement. I think that it used to be that we’re focused on the halvings. But at this point, the entire natural supply of Bitcoin is only 450 Bitcoin available for sale every day. That’s sort of about $45 – $50 million a day at this level. That is all being consumed by the Bitcoin treasury companies. And the Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) are coming on strong. So I’m very bullish.” Saylor goes on to slightly upgrade his price prediction for the flagship digital asset, noting that he believes it will outpace other key asset classes, such as real estate and the S&P 500. “My forecast in July of last year in Nashville was Bitcoin’s going to appreciate 29% a year on average for the next 21 years. And that moves it from it was about mid $60s, $65,000 to $13 million a coin in the year 2045. I’m getting more bullish on that forecast, but I’m certainly comfortable forecasting 30% a year ARR (annual recurring revenue) on average for the next 20 years. I think Bitcoin’s up 57% a year for the past four and a half years. Again, that’s double the Mag seven. That’s quadruple the S&P. That’s eight times real estate and bonds are down 4%. So Bitcoin is smashing everything.” Strategy is currently the world’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, coming in at 580,955 BTC worth just over $61.3 billion, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries. Bitcoin is trading for $105,431 at time of writing, a fractional decrease on the day.

2025-06-08T09:05:49,"Japan introduces revised ‘crypto-friendly’ Payment Services Act - What should investors expect?","The upper house of Japan’s National Diet passed the revised Payment Services Act (PSA) on Friday, resulting in big changes ahead for enterprises dealing with crypto. The new category of “intermediary business” alleviates the need for middleman companies in Japan to register as exchanges, but the bill has other implications, some of which bring stricter rules and greater centralization. Originally submitted to the Japan Diet back in March, the amendments to the Payment Services Act passed on Friday , and are being praised as pro-crypto.Perhaps drawing the most attention is the establishment of a new category of “intermediary business,” meaning businesses who introduce or act as liaisons between exchangers and users. Such groups will no longer have to register as an exchange with the government’s regulator, the Financial Services Agency (FSA).A separate registration, with relaxed rules, will be introduced for these intermediaries. Image: Chihiro Sakai . What’s in the new law: Stablecoins, intermediary businesses, emergency outflow barriers Under FSA discussion since November last year, the amended Payment Services Act is being cited by regional media as likely removing barriers for gaming companies and others that want to do business related to cryptocurrency and digital assets.Interest from Mercari, SBI Securities, and Monex Securities has already been reported regarding registering as an “intermediary business.”Some key changes to the act are as follows: Creation of “intermediary” businesses with relaxed registration rules. Creation of a separate registration system for exchanges. New ability to issue a legal order requiring overseas-based crypto firms to hold assets in Japan to prevent outflows in case of bankruptcy. “Trust-type” stablecoin backing assets can now be held partially (up to 50%) in low-risk investments like government bonds, instead of being 100% backed in fiat by the issuer. Stricter rules for businesses deemed overseas “collection agencies” providing e-commerce services. FSA chart detailing changes to trust-type stablecoin regulations. Source: FSA . The amended law, set to take effect within one year, essentially cements strict AML/CFT requirements and rules for registered exchange operators and e-commerce collection agencies, eases entry to the regulated crypto ecosystem for liaison businesses (which must be under the supervision of a registered operator), prevents overseas exchanges from running off with Japanese users’ money, and helps banks issue stablecoins more easily. Centralization, stricter rules — Drifting further from Satoshi While it’s understandable that gaming enterprises and others are happy to hear the news of the amendment’s success, and removal of barriers to entry, Tokyo and Japan-based adherents to Satoshi Nakamoto’s original idea of separation of money and state will see the law as a nothing-burger. Or a poison apple, more accurately.Massive banks can now issue stablecoins more easily, leveraging state credit, while overseas, permissionless markets and competitors are further targeted as threats.As Coinpost reported in 2022 of a Mitsubishi UFJ working group focused on stablecoins: “The aim is to put a stop to the current situation in which funds are flowing mainly into overseas stablecoins, including through investment in overseas Web3 (decentralized app) projects, use of major NFT markets, and even cover trading in cryptocurrency exchanges.” Businesses that handle money deemed cross-border “collection agencies” involved with activities such as e-commerce can also be regulated under the revised PSA. Source: FSA . Crackdown on foreign payment agents deemed cross-border “collection agencies,” such as those involved with e-commerce, is a slippery slope. The FSA notes it will not go after low-risk activities or require registration from low-risk intermediaries, while threatening a crackdown on online casinos and fraud, noting that “Those who conduct illegal remittances, such as online casinos and investment fraud, will be subject to regulation as unregistered businesses” under the new amendment.As with all legislation, arbitrary political interpretation allows for endless abuse. Previously, cross-border collection agencies were not required to register as a funds transfer business with the state. Now, they must rely on the FSA’s assurances only, in a state of relative limbo.Fortunately for the advocates of peer-to-peer, permissionless transactions, no matter what the new regulations bring, use of actual crypto — not regulated, bank-issued stablecoins — remains one path toward economic freedom and peace in Japan, in a time of a faltering yen, rice shortages , and mainstream monetary malaise.

The FCA had banned ETNs in January 2021 , citing their volatility and complexity for retail investors. However, because we’re seeing increasing warmth towards cryptocurrency across the globe, the UK doesn’t want to be left behind. Keep reading to find out more about the UK’s decision regarding ETNs, how the US also has major pro-crypto legislation in the works, and what the best crypto to buy now is in light of these developments. UK & UK Embrace Crypto For those unaware, an ETN is a debt security instrument offered by recognized entities. Its value is tied to an underlying asset, which, in the case of crypto, is a specific coin. As the price of the underlying asset goes up, the price of the ETN will also increase, and vice versa. It’s worth noting that crypto ownership in the UK has increased from 18% in 2024 to 24% in 2025 . This is more than that of the US. Naturally, a growth like this calls for a comprehensive regulatory design to regulate the ownership and use of digital assets in the country. Meanwhile, in the US, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act is expected to go for a floor vote soon enough. The GENIUS Act aims to regulate various aspects of stablecoins, such as permitted issuers, transparency, consumer protection, federal and state-level oversight authority, and legal classification. All in all, a friendlier regulatory environment will lead to a more thriving crypto market. Bitcoin recently made an all-time high of $112K , and with positive and proactive legislative support, it might soon hit $150K, too. To hop on the crypto train and make the most of its momentum, consider investing in the following altcoins. 1. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Best Crypto to Buy Now, the Fastest and Most Affordable Trading Bot Increased crypto adoption will directly impact the growth of meme coins, which is already among the most profitable niches of the crypto space. As a result, Snorter Token could see massive growth in the coming weeks. It’s a Telegram-native trading bot designed to snipe (buy) the best meme coins as soon as they’re launched using a contact address or pool ID. This way, it will help you outsmart the bots and whales circling like sharks in the crypto market. Snorter Bot is mighty secure, too. It’s got honeypot and rugpull detection, mint trap detection, real-time blacklist scans, and freeze alerts. Other useful features include copy-trading tools, portfolio tracking, and the lowest trading fees (just 0.85%) of all competitors if you hold $SNORT. You can become an early investor in this awesome meme coin with real utility by buying into its presale. The Snorter Token presale is fairly new but has still managed to raise over $575K. Each token is currently priced at just $0.0947. 2. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Bitcoin-Themed Meme Coin Offering Free $BTC Airdrops BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) will help you directly benefit from Bitcoin’s upcoming bull run, but at a fraction of the cost. It’ll do so in two ways: First, you’ll profit from a substantial increase in $BTCBULL’s price. According to our predictions, BTC Bull Token can reach $0.0096 by 2026 – a 3.7x jump from its current price of $0.00255. Second, you’ll benefit from BTC Bull Token’s free Bitcoin airdrops. A striking feature, the aforementioned $BTC airdrops will take place when Bitcoin reaches $150K and $200K for the very first time. However, only those who hold their $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet and participate in the airdrop events on social media will be eligible for free $BTC. Even better for $BTCBULL owners, the project will regularly shave off a part of the token supply. This will increase the crypto’s demand, which would then, in all likelihood, crank up its price. Buy BTC Bull Token now for just $0.00255 each. The project has emerged as one of the best crypto presales , with nearly $7M in early investor funding. 3. KoKoK The Roach ($KOKOK) – Viral New Meme Coin with Massive Potential KoKoK The Roach ($KOKOK) is a new meme coin that launched towards the end of May but has risen to become a force to reckon with in the entire crypto space. $KOKOK is up over 310% since its inception , including a chunky 28% gain over just the past seven days. This fascinating ‘disgusting’ meme coin is proof that degens have enough love to share with other animals, too, besides cute dogs, cats, and frogs. ‘The King of the Drain Pipes’ might be a fitting description for $KOKOK, but the fact remains that it could soon surge past its all-time high of around $0.20 and become one of the greatest meme coins of this year. It’s currently trading at $0.1724, with a market capitalization of $35M and a trading volume of $1.13M (up 110% over the past 24 hours).

Here’s How","XRP has faced heightened market uncertainty in recent weeks, with its value fluctuating after briefly losing a critical support level. After falling below $2.20, the asset staged a minor recovery, stabilizing near $2.17. These shifts have sparked renewed discussion about XRP’s long-term performance. While many traders adjusted their positions following the dip, one market participant has chosen to maintain a firm stance. Known publicly as Crypto Beast (@cryptobeastreal), the trader revealed that he holds a sizable XRP position and has no plans to reduce or liquidate it. According to information he shared, Crypto Beast owns approximately 1.83 million XRP, acquired at an average cost of $0.836. This suggests the purchase was made before the November 2024 price surge, when XRP began a remarkable climb. This climb culminated in a multi-year peak of $3.39, but Crypto Beast did not sell any of his tokens during or after the price surge. Never sold my XRP If XRP reaches $5.45 this will be worth $10 million dollars. Smaller than my $16 million ETH bag, but still alot of money. I’ll keep you updated on my position. pic.twitter.com/2dwQrr75rY — Crypto Beast (@cryptobeastreal) June 6, 2025 The $10 Million XRP Gain Target At the time of his public update, XRP was priced at around $2.13, bringing the value of his investment to roughly $3.9 million. Despite having gained more than $2.3 million in unrealized profit, the trader indicated that his objective is a portfolio value of $10 million. To meet this target, XRP would need to reach $5.45 per token, a 151% increase from current market levels. Experts have recently spotted bullish technical indicators on the XRP’s chart, and a popular analyst has predicted that the digital asset will soon make more millionaires , potentially setting the stage for Crypto Beast to fulfill his goal. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Crypto Beast’s investment is fully allocated on the spot market, meaning there is no exposure to forced liquidations due to leverage. This allows him to hodl through downturns without facing mandatory position closures. Holding for the Long Term Spot holdings are stable, unlike high-leverage trades. James Wynn, who became famous for PEPE gains, lost a total of $125 million via high-leverage Bitcoin trades on Hyperliquid after sharp corrections triggered massive liquidations of his long position. This event shocked the crypto world. Some have referenced it as a sign of market manipulation by exchanges . Some commentators have encouraged investors to adopt a long-term outlook. Figures like Edoardo Farina have advised accumulating XRP, revealing that he doesn’t intend to sell significant amounts until the asset hits $100 . He has also advised investors to move their tokens to cold storage , protecting their investments from manipulation or loss due to problems with exchanges. Investors who follow his advice may become millionaires like Crypto Beast if XRP rises. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Since most altcoins are quite sluggish on a daily scale, we will examine in more detail their weekly performances, where TAO and CRO stand in one corner, while HYPE, LEO, ICP, and TRX are in the other. BTC Above $105K The world’s largest cryptocurrency tried to break out at the beginning of the business week from its consolidation range but was stopped at $106,000 and $106,500 on Monday and Tuesday. The following rejections drove it south to the lower boundary, but the bulls went on the offensive once again on Thursday. However, bitcoin was stopped once again at $106,000, but this time, the correction was a lot more violent. Perhaps influenced by the ongoing spat between US President Trump and Tesla CEO Musk, BTC’s price tumbled hard and went to a multi-week low of $100,400 (on Bitstamp). As it came close to a breakdown below the coveted $100,000 level, the situation reversed and bitcoin started to recover some ground. By Friday noon, it had rebounded to around $105,000. Slightly more volatility followed, but BTC was ultimately stopped at $106,000 yesterday and now trades around $500 lower. Its market capitalization has risen to just shy of $2.1 trillion, while its dominance over the alts stands tall at 61.5%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts Up and Down The weekly scale shows that HYPE has emerged as the top gainer, having surged by almost 9%. As a result, the high-flyer now sits above $35, just less than $5 away from its recent peak. ICP follows suit with an 8% weekly increase, while LEO, TRX, and AAVE are next. On the opposite scale are TAO (-11%), GT (-5.3%), and CRO (-5.2%). SOL, DOGE, ADA, AVAX, and SHIB are also about to close the weekly candle in the red. The total crypto market cap has added around $30 billion since yesterday and is up to $3.410 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

2025-06-08T08:00:18,"Ethereum Consolidates Below $2,800 – Bulls Need This Level To Trigger Next Leg Up","Ethereum is showing resilience amid the recent wave of market volatility and uncertainty. While the broader crypto market has pulled back over the past few weeks, ETH continues to hold firm above the $2,500 level — a key psychological and technical support zone. This strength has caught the attention of traders and analysts who see Ethereum’s current price action as a potential launchpad for a move into higher territory. Related Reading: Solana Key Indicator Flashes Buy Signal On Daily Chart – Rally Ahead? Despite the retracement across major altcoins, Ethereum remains structurally intact, with bulls defending the lower boundary of its current range. The lack of panic-selling at these levels suggests growing confidence in ETH’s long-term trajectory, even as macroeconomic pressures — including tighter liquidity and geopolitical uncertainty — continue to weigh on sentiment. Top analyst Ted Pillows recently shared a technical update highlighting that ETH is still trading within a well-defined range. According to his view, Ethereum’s ability to consolidate without losing critical support is a sign of underlying strength. A breakout above the range high could trigger renewed momentum toward the $2,800–$3,000 region, while a breakdown below $2,500 would invalidate the current setup. Ethereum Approaches Pivotal Zone Amid Uncertainty The crypto market has been navigating a volatile environment, and Ethereum is no exception. However, despite the turbulence, ETH has managed to maintain its footing above $2,500 — a key support level that continues to act as a buffer against deeper downside. With Bitcoin holding strong and altcoins preparing for potential breakout moves, the coming weeks could be decisive for Ethereum’s next major trend. ETH currently trades 48% below its all-time high, but price action suggests that bulls are building momentum. Ethereum has absorbed recent volatility well, even as broader market sentiment remains shaken by rising geopolitical tensions, most notably, the growing conflict between Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump. While these headlines have added uncertainty, Ethereum’s ability to stay range-bound reflects growing confidence among investors. Pillows notes that Ethereum is still trading within a well-defined range, and the structure remains intact. According to his analysis, reclaiming the $2,800 level would be a key breakout trigger, potentially opening the door for a fast rally to $4,000. Until then, ETH remains in consolidation mode — but with Bitcoin showing leadership and the market entering a pivotal phase, Ethereum could be on the verge of catching up. If bulls can maintain control and push through resistance, ETH could finally break out of its range and reenter a bullish price discovery phase. But if resistance holds, traders may see another leg of consolidation. Either way, Ethereum is entering a key window where market direction will likely be defined, and how ETH behaves around the $2,800 mark could determine the altcoin outlook for the rest of the summer. Related Reading: Ethereum Stabilizes After Market Drop – Key MA Reclaim Could Trigger A June Rally ETH Weekly Chart Shows Momentum Building Near Resistance Ethereum is holding steady near $2,500 as seen on the weekly chart, showing promising signs of strength despite recent market-wide volatility. After bouncing sharply from sub-$1,800 levels in May, ETH is now consolidating just below the $2,707 resistance — the 50-week simple moving average (SMA). This level coincides with the upper boundary of the current range and remains the key line bulls need to reclaim to unlock further upside. ETH is currently trading above its 34-week EMA ($2,501) and the 200-week SMA ($2,450), both of which are acting as dynamic support. Holding these levels reinforces the idea that buyers are stepping in on dips, providing a strong base for potential continuation. However, the price is still capped by the 100-week SMA at $2,610, making the $2,700–$2,800 region a critical resistance zone. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Key Range Support After Pullback – Bulls Eye $3,000 Level A weekly close above this cluster of moving averages could trigger a breakout and pave the way toward $3,000 and beyond.

The suit had sought over $1 billion in damages, claiming the delisting favored Coinbase’s cbBTC token. Coinbase reported mixed Q1 earnings, with revenue up but net income down 94%. Coinbase and BiT Global have reached a settlement in their legal dispute over the delisting of BiT Global’s wrapped bitcoin (wBTC) token from the exchange. According to a joint court filing , BiT Global has agreed to dismiss its lawsuit against Coinbase with prejudice, preventing future legal action on the matter. Both parties will cover their own legal costs. Details of any further settlement terms were not disclosed. BiT Global Sued Coinbase Over wBTC Delisting in California Court BiT Global filed the suit last year in the Northern District of California, after Coinbase removed wBTC from its platform. The exchange cited “unacceptable risk” that the token could be controlled by Chinese-born crypto billionaire Justin Sun, who became affiliated with wBTC through a partnership in August 2023. Coinbase raised concerns after Sun’s involvement, questioning BiT Global about his role in the token’s operations. Meanwhile, Sun-backed World Liberty Financial switched its cbBTC holdings in favor of wBTC following his appointment as an advisor. BiT Global argued the delisting was unjustified and damaged both liquidity and market confidence in wBTC, while allegedly giving an edge to Coinbase’s rival product, cbBTC, launched two months prior to the delisting. Coinbase and BiT Global have settled their dispute over the delisting of wBTC, with BiT Global dismissing its lawsuit filed in the Northern District of California. Both parties will cover their own legal fees. BiT Global had alleged that Coinbase unjustifiably delisted wBTC,… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) June 7, 2025 BiT Global has been a joint custodian of wBTC’s Bitcoin reserves, alongside crypto firm BitGo, since August 2024. The lawsuit sought more than $1 billion in damages and requested injunctive relief to prevent further harm. However, with the dismissal finalized, the legal chapter between the two firms is now closed. Coinbase Q1 Revenue Climbs, But Profit Falls 94% Coinbase reported mixed first-quarter results , with revenue rising 24% year-over-year to $2 billion, but falling short of analyst expectations and down 10% from the previous quarter. While transaction revenue grew to $1.26 billion, its subscription and services division—covering staking and custodial offerings, rose 37% to nearly $700 million, reflecting growing diversification beyond trading. Despite the revenue uptick, net income plunged 94% to $66 million as the company marked down its crypto holdings amid market volatility. Adjusted earnings stood at $526.6 million, or $1.94 per share, still below last year’s figure of $2.53. Operating expenses surged 51% to $1.3 billion due to aggressive marketing and asset write-downs. Coinbase’s earnings were weighed down by unpredictable macroeconomic conditions and fluctuations in digital asset prices. However, the company noted its second-highest ever monthly user count, with CFO Alesia Haas highlighting increased engagement across non-trading services.

2025-06-08T07:44:08,"Bitcoin core devs’ statement sparks argument in the community","A joint statement from Bitcoin core developers has sparked arguments among the members of the community. According to the core devs, they want a hands-off approach to how the Bitcoin network is used, a proposal that has not gone down well with everyone in the community. The proposal is coming amid the ongoing controversy concerning non-monetary use cases. “This is not endorsing or condoning non-financial data usage, but accepting that as a censorship-resistant system, Bitcoin can and will be used for use cases not everyone agrees on,” the statement published on the Bitcoin Core website said. In the letter, the developers argued that the Bitcoin network is defined by its users, who are free to choose what software they use and implement the policies they want. The post also highlighted that its core contributors are not in a position to mandate what software or policies they desire. This statement comes amid the ongoing debate over spam inscriptions on the Bitcoin network. “Being free to run any software is the network’s primary safeguard against coercion,” the developers added. Bitcoin community divided after developers’ statement The statement seemed to have gone down well with many Bitcoiners, and like with every update, some people were against it. One of its critics was JAN3 CEO Samson Mow , who had issues with the tone of the letter. “Bitcoin Core devs have been changing the network gradually to enable spam and now seem focused on also removing barriers for spammers. It’s disingenuous to just say “It is what it is now, too bad.” This statement itself is also inappropriate. Feels like an NYA from Core devs,” he said. A statement on Bitcoin Core development and transaction relay policy – https://t.co/K4AaPPqTSD — Bitcoin Core Project (@bitcoincoreorg) June 7, 2025 Mow’s statement comes after a May 8 update in which the core developers decided to remove a long-standing limit on transaction data in a network upgrade to allow for larger data segments. “Bitcoin Core’s next release will, by default, relay and mine transactions whose OP_RETURN outputs exceed 80 bytes and allow any number of these outputs,” the announcement read on GitHub. Like with this update, some Bitcoiners still saw an opening to non-financial use cases. Meanwhile, Casa founder Jameson Lopp defended the letter. Lopp mentioned that the core developers are saying that they don’t want to force anyone to run a code they don’t want, highlighting what they think about relay policy and network health. “When there was no cohesive message, and it was just a bunch of independent developers making individual statements, Bitcoin Core was accused of having “poor public relations,” Lopp said. He also added that now that the group has published a joint statement, people are finding a reason to be offended about it. Developers make their case in the joint letter According to the developers, it is better for the BTC node software “to aim to have a realistic idea of what will end up in the next block, rather than attempting to intervene between consenting transaction creators and miners to discourage activity that is largely harmless at a technical level.” They also added that while this view is not shared by all users and developers, they believe that it is in the best interest of Bitcoin and its users, hoping that they agree with their statement. The developers mentioned that the main goals of transaction relay are predicting what Bitcoin transactions will be mined, speeding up block propagation” for the transactions expected to be mined, and helping BTC miners learn about fee-paying transactions. Meanwhile, Bitcoiner Carl Honton has criticized the bill saying, “It’s Bit “Coin” not Bit “Bucket” or Bit “Store” or whatever general purpose data store you have in mind. It’s a “peer-to-peer electronic cash system.” Bitcoin core developer Luke Dashjr also criticized what the group aimed to achieve with the relay policy outlined in the statement. “The goals of transaction relay listed are basically all wrong,” Dashjr said. He added that predicting what will be mined is a centralizing goal. Expecting spam to be mined is defeatism. Helping spam propagate is harmful. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-06-08T07:41:58,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Golden Cross Pattern Targets $150,000 Rally","Bitcoin is once again flashing a historically bullish signal, a golden cross, as traders eye the $150,000 mark. Currently trading at $105,597 with a daily volume of over $35 billion, BTC has pulled back slightly after its latest golden cross. This setup occurs when the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day average, typically viewed as the start of a long-term uptrend. Chain Mind, a widely followed crypto analyst, notes that this pullback isn’t unusual. In fact, it mirrors what happened in late 2024. Back then, Bitcoin dropped 10% right after the golden cross , only to surge over 60% in the following two months. The recent 8% decline post-cross appears to be following the same script. 3/➫ Back in Q4 2024, $BTC dropped 10% right after the golden cross ❍ Then it reversed hard and rallied over 60% in two months ❍ That pattern is repeating now – $BTC has already dropped 8% post-cross ❍ The similarities are striking — 𝗖𝗛𝗔𝗜𝗡 𝗠𝗜𝗡𝗗 (@0xChainMind) June 5, 2025 He emphasizes patience. While many expect immediate gains from a golden cross, history suggests the pattern often begins with a dip before a broader rally unfolds. According to Chain Mind, the setup remains intact, and the $150,000 target by year-end remains realistic. Bitcoin Holds Key Support Zone What reinforces the bullish bias is Bitcoin’s ability to stay well above its 200-day moving average, which now sits near $94,700. This level acts as critical long-term support. As long as BTC holds above it, the Bitcoin price prediction remains bullish. Bitcoin Price Chart Source: Tradingview Chain Mind also highlights a rise in Bitcoin dominance, which has hit a three-year high. Investors are rotating capital out of altcoins and back into Bitcoin, viewing it as a safer store of value amid broader market uncertainty. Consider these signs of strength: Bitcoin’s dominance is rising, while altcoins are losing ground. Ethereum (ETH) is struggling to hold above $2,500. Altcoins like SOL and ADA have broken key support levels. Long-term holders continue to sit on their BTC instead of selling. This points to sustained institutional interest. Firms like Metaplanet and Strategy have been buying large amounts of Bitcoin, while spot ETFs continue to see inflows, despite price volatility. Institutions Favor Bitcoin, Not Altcoins One of the clearest signs that Bitcoin remains in favor is the behavior of large investors, also known as “whales.” On-chain data shows a significant portion of Bitcoin supply hasn’t moved in months, reinforcing the idea that long-term holders aren’t shaken. Altcoins, on the other hand, are under pressure. Many are not just lagging BTC, they’re also falling against the U.S. dollar. Chain Mind points out that until sentiment improves and key percentages, such as ETH/BTC or SOL/BTC, begin trending higher, Bitcoin will continue to dominate. To sum it up: The golden cross pattern is historically bullish, even in the face of short-term dips. BTC holding above $94,700 supports the uptrend. Rising dominance and institutional inflows point to a potential surge. For traders and investors alike, this is a classic case of “zooming out.” The short-term noise may rattle nerves, but structurally, the setup for a powerful Bitcoin rally toward $150,000 appears intact.

2025-06-08T07:35:10,"BITQ: Exposure To Bitcoin With An Added Layer Of Risk","Summary BITQ offers exposure to bitcoin-related equities, but introduces additional operational and business risks compared to direct bitcoin investment. The ETF is highly concentrated, with top holdings like MicroStrategy and Coinbase heavily influencing performance and adding company-specific risk. BITQ is volatile, directionally correlates with bitcoin, and has a higher expense ratio than direct bitcoin ETFs, making it less attractive for pure bitcoin exposure. Given these factors, I recommend a HOLD rating on BITQ, suggesting investors consider direct bitcoin funds for simpler, lower-risk exposure. Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF ( BITQ ) is an equity ETF designed to provide investors with exposure to the equity of companies involved in bitcoin. Before investing in this strategy, one must be aware of the additional layer of risks involved in holding a portfolio of companies involved in the bitcoin market. If one is seeking direct exposure to bitcoin, it may be worth considering one of the bitcoin funds as opposed to an equity strategy. BITQ holds roughly 30 individual equities of companies that span from bitcoin miners to banks and asset managers. Overall, the basis for the strategy is to hold a portfolio of ""picks and shovels"" companies building out the core infrastructure for bitcoin, including miners and brokerages. Interestingly enough, Strategy ( MSTR ), formerly known as MicroStrategy, is the portfolio's top holding despite having minimal involvement in the development of the bitcoin ecosystem. Nonetheless, Strategy is a large holder of bitcoin through a leveraged debt & equity issuance strategy for acquiring bitcoin. The target balance for the strategy is to allocate a minimum of 80% of the portfolio to Tier 1 crypto innovator companies whose primary focus is in the crypto market with the remaining 20% in Tier 2, large-cap companies with diversified business interests that include ""one significant public business line focused on the crypto market."" Accordingly, for a company to be classified as a Tier 1 company, 75% of their revenue must derive from servicing cryptocurrency markets. This includes crypto mining firms, crypto mining equipment suppliers, crypto financial services companies, and other financial institutions servicing primarily crypto-related clientele. Companies can also be classified as Tier 1 organizations if 75% of net assets are direct holdings of bitcoin, Ethereum, or other related cryptocurrencies, resulting in Strategy being classified as a Tier 1 Crypto Innovator. Corporate Reports With BITQ holding 30 companies, company concentration will be greater than when compared to larger, more diverse portfolio strategies. Accordingly, the top 10 holdings account for 60.35% of the total portfolio weight. This may mean that the direction of the portfolio strategy can be determined primarily by the top 10 holdings, which include bitcoin miners and a brokerage platform. Corporate Reports Strategy is by far the most heavily weighted company in the strategy, accounting for 11.97% of the portfolio. Though my most recent research covering MSTR is quite dated , I believe the overview can be helpful in assessing the company. MSTR has a unique investment proposition in which the organization issues debt and equity to buy bitcoin in a flywheel fashion. The organization sells this strategy as a leveraged bitcoin fund. The other side of the business consists of legacy operations relating to its business intelligence platform, which many investors in MSTR downplay as the organization transforms into a bitcoin strategy. Given the weight of MSTR in the portfolio, I recommend potential investors research this company prior to making an investment decision in BITQ. The second-largest holding in BITQ is Coinbase Global ( COIN ), a cryptocurrency brokerage platform, at 9.45% of the portfolio weighting. Many of the names following are mining organizations, with MARA Holdings ( MARA ) being by far the largest miner in the cohort. Though my research covering MARA is also dated, I believe understanding the company's structure can help investors determine whether BITQ is an appropriate investment strategy. In short, MARA is a cryptocurrency mining company that began diversifying its business strategy last year into data center infrastructure, including submerged server cooling units. Though the mining industry is power-intensive, the strategy has shifted in the last few years from strictly mining to offloading heat generated from the servers as a form of energy production. Overall, the industry is relatively volatile, with profitability remaining relatively challenged. Given the volatile nature of bitcoin and reporting requirements, financial analysis of the industry can be relatively challenging and may not appropriately represent the industry. FinChat Additionally, given the volatility of bitcoin, fund performance can drastically vary from period to period, showing large gains or losses at any given time. Corporate Reports Year-to-date, BITQ has outperformed the S&P 500 ( SPX ) despite the drastically larger drawdown. TradingView As a result of the volatility in the bitcoin and related market, this strategy may be best suited for active traders or those willing to undertake major short-term risks. In general, BITQ is directionally correlated with the underlying bitcoin market. Under this notion, investing in BITQ may add an additional layer of operational risk when compared to a direct investment in bitcoin. Given that the equities in the portfolio are businesses and not a commodity, one must consider the business operations in addition to bitcoin performance as an associated risk. This may also include industry risk, political risk, and financial performance. TradingView BITQ has an expense ratio of 80bps, making BITQ relatively more expensive than comparable strategies. Given the relative correlation between related equity ETFs and bitcoin ETFs, it may be worth considering investing in bitcoin ETFs given the relative performance, lower fees, and comparable performance. Seeking Alpha My recommendation is to take into consideration the broader risk profile of the portfolio companies that make up BITQ. If seeking bitcoin exposure, it may be wise to consider one of the bitcoin funds over the equity ETFs, as many of the business-related risks aren't prevalent. I am recommending BITQ with a HOLD rating.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4793231-bitq-exposure-to-bitcoin-with-an-added-layer-of-risk?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|RESEARCH","BITQ",cryptocompare
2025-06-08T07:31:03,"Ripple Price Analysis: Increased Bearish Momentum as XRP Fails to Break Out","After a long consolidation phase, XRP continues to underperform compared to many other altcoins despite ongoing speculation around regulatory clarity. Recent price action shows increasing bearish momentum. Buyers have failed to hold critical levels on both the USDT and BTC pairs, suggesting a cautious outlook for the short term. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The USDT Pair XRP/USDT is now trading around $2.2 after getting rejected from the higher boundary of the large descending channel. The price has also lost the 100-day MA (orange) and is testing the 200-day MA (blue), both located around the $2.30 mark. The RSI also sits near 44, reflecting weak bullish momentum and a lack of buying interest. A daily close below the psychological level at $2 would likely open the door for a deeper correction toward the $1.55 demand zone, which also aligns with the lower trendline of the channel. Until the buyers reclaim the moving averages with strong volume, the trend favours the sellers. Structurally, the market remains neutral to bearish, with a potential shift toward bearish if the current consolidation fails to reverse. Investors should watch for a reaction around the $1.90–$2 area, which will likely dictate the next directional impulse. The BTC Pair The XRP/BTC pair is trading around the 2,100 SAT mark after a prolonged grind lower within a descending wedge structure. Once again, the price has lost both the 100-day and 200-day MAs, which have also created a bearish crossover around the 2,500 SAT mark, and is now hovering above the lower channel boundary and the 2,000 SAT demand zone. There is also a notable FVG (Fair Value Gap) in the 1,600 – 1,900 SAT range, which may act as a magnet and a support zone in case the 2,000 SAT level breaks down. Buyers will need to reclaim the moving averages and break above the channel’s higher trendline around the 2,500–2,700 SAT zone to regain any strength, which currently seems unlikely unless Bitcoin itself consolidates. As long as the price remains within the channel, short-term relief bounces are possible, but momentum still favours sellers. The broader implication is continued BTC strength or XRP relative weakness in the market cycle.

XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch. The current presale gives early investors the chance to grab $XYZ tokens at a significantly discounted price , far below the expected listing price. Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.003333 by Stage 12, with over 70% of the $15 million milestone already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a final presale target price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project.

The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Bitcoin’s Journey: Is the Original Cryptocurrency Still King? Bitcoin, created by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, is the first cryptocurrency. It operates without a central authority, allowing people to send money directly to each other. Instead of physical coins, Bitcoin uses a shared ledger called blockchain. This ledger is spread across many computers, so no single entity controls it. Transactions are verified by miners, who solve complex puzzles to add new records and are rewarded with bitcoins. This process keeps the system secure and prevents fraud. In today’s market, Bitcoin remains a major player among cryptocurrencies. Its limited supply of 21 million coins and events called “halvings,” which reduce miners’ rewards every four years, affect its value and mining. Compared to other coins, Bitcoin is seen as digital gold—a store of value. Recent trends show renewed interest in Bitcoin as people look for alternatives to traditional money. While other cryptocurrencies offer different features, Bitcoin’s established network and early start make it attractive to many. Ethereum’s Leap into the Future: Scalability and Growth Await Ethereum has been a pioneer in the blockchain world since its launch in 2015. Created by Vitalik Buterin, it introduced smart contracts and a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications, or dApps. With the move to Proof-of-Stake through the Merge in 2022, Ethereum reduced its energy consumption and opened new possibilities for efficiency. Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon help speed up transactions and lower costs. The upcoming sharding phase aims to make the network even more scalable and affordable. Ether (ETH), the network’s native token, remains central, used for transactions, rewarding stakers, and as a tradable asset. In the current market cycle, Ethereum’s advancements make it a significant player to watch. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, its shift to Proof-of-Stake and focus on scalability set it apart. Predictions based on historical price movements and Bitcoin halving cycles estimate that ETH’s price could reach as high as $6,580.53 next year. By 2025, the yearly low is estimated at $2,700.31, with further growth expected up to 2030. These trends suggest that Ethereum may have considerable potential in the years ahead, especially as it continues to innovate and strengthen its network. Solana’s SOL Coin: The Fast Lane of Blockchain Technology Solana is making waves in the blockchain world with its focus on speed and scalability. Unlike some of its competitors like Ethereum and Cardano, Solana is designed to handle thousands of transactions per second without slowing down. This is great news for developers who want to build decentralized apps, known as dapps. Solana supports multiple programming languages, making it easier for more people to create on its platform. At the core of Solana is its native cryptocurrency, SOL. This coin powers transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards those who help keep the network running smoothly. Many see bright potential in SOL. Its technology allows it to support a high-capacity network, which is ideal for services that need to handle a lot of users at once. In today’s market, where fast and efficient blockchain solutions are in demand, SOL stands out. Compared to other coins, it offers quicker transaction times and lower fees. With the growing interest in areas like decentralized finance and NFTs, Solana’s capabilities make it a strong contender. For investors and developers looking for the next big thing in crypto, SOL could be an attractive option. XRP: The Fast and Borderless Currency Shaking Up the Crypto World Have you heard of XRP? It’s a digital currency that’s making waves. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP was designed to be fast, cheap, and accessible to everyone. Unlike traditional money, it doesn’t rely on banks or central authorities. Transactions are quick, secure, and can’t be reversed. With an initial supply of 100 billion, most of which was given to Ripple (formerly OpenCoin Inc.), XRP aims to make transferring money as easy as sending a text. In today’s market, XRP stands out for its speed and low costs. While some cryptocurrencies struggle with slow transfers and high fees, XRP offers a sleek alternative. It allows smooth payments across different currencies, making it valuable in our global economy. Ripple’s efforts to boost network liquidity and support the ecosystem could enhance XRP’s potential even more. Compared to other coins, XRP’s focus on real-world use makes it an attractive option. As the crypto world evolves, currencies like XRP that solve practical problems might lead the way.

2025-06-08T07:19:14,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: Failure to Reclaim These Levels Can Result in a Sub-$100K Correction","Bitcoin has entered a corrective phase after tagging the $111K region, following a strong multi-week rally. While momentum has cooled, the broader structure remains intact. The price action is showing signs of potential accumulation at support, and traders are watching closely to see if this pullback turns into a deeper correction or a fresh leg up. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, BTC is currently holding above the $103K region after sweeping the $101K sell-side liquidity. The previous bullish structure is still valid, and the price is likely targeting the mid-range of the ascending channel. The 100-day (orange) and 200-day (blue) moving averages are not far below, sitting at $92K and $95K, respectively, and continue to slope upward. This indicates that the long-term bullish momentum is not yet broken. The RSI on the daily is recovering slightly from below 50, suggesting neutral momentum after days of cooling off. Until the asset breaks below the $100K–$101K range, the current drop looks like a healthy correction in an uptrend. However, failure to reclaim the $106K–$108K resistance area quickly could increase the probability of revisiting the $95K–$97K order block, and even the two moving averages. The 4-Hour Chart Zooming into the 4H chart, BTC wicked below the descending wedge pattern after finding strong demand near the $100K area and began a V-shaped recovery. This structure historically signals a bullish reversal, and the move back above $103K supports this case. However, the current rally is approaching resistance again, which is the higher boundary of the pattern near the $105K mark, and the RSI is still under 50. This level could act as a temporary ceiling unless momentum strengthens. The sharp wick below $100K looks like a textbook liquidity grab, suggesting market makers ran stops before driving the price higher. If the buyers manage to hold above the $100K base and flip the $105K–$106K area, the door reopens for a push toward $108K and possibly a new all-time high above $112K. On the other hand, a failure to do so would likely lead to more range-bound action between $101K and $106K in the coming days. On-Chain Analysis Exchange Reserve The Exchange Reserve chart reveals a persistent and steep decline in the amount of Bitcoin held on centralized exchanges, now reaching a historic low at 2.3 million BTC. This trend has accelerated over the past year and continues into June 2025, despite BTC trading above $100K. In classical supply-demand terms, this represents a significant supply-side squeeze: fewer coins on exchanges mean less liquidity available for instant sale, tightening the circulating supply and amplifying the impact of even moderate demand spikes. This behaviour reflects a strong macroeconomic undercurrent. First, institutional accumulation is likely driving much of this trend. Large entities often move coins off exchanges into custody solutions when positioning for long-term holding or to reduce counterparty risk. Second, the growing presence of spot Bitcoin ETFs and custodial platforms (like Fidelity or BlackRock) means that BTC is increasingly flowing into vehicles that don’t recycle it back onto exchanges, removing it from the liquid supply indefinitely. This dynamic creates structural illiquidity that underpins Bitcoin’s asymmetric upside.

Speaking at the 2025 Forbes Iconoclast Summit, Larry Fink details the remarkable pace at which the US has amassed an astronomical amount of debt. “After 223 years of being a nation in 2000, the [national debt] of the United States was $8 trillion. And in the last 25 years, both parties are guilty of this, [that number’s] now at $36 trillion. And now we have a pending tax bill that’s going to add $2.3 to $2.4 trillion on the back of that. If we don’t find a way to grow at 3% a year, real growth, we’re going to hit the wall.” Although the numbers are bleak, Fink believes the US can still climb out of its multi-trillion-dollar hole, outlining a number of steps that policymakers can take to spur real economic growth across multiple industries. “This is why we need to unlock more private capital… We need to be streamlining permitting, we need to be focused on rebuilding our infrastructure. If you believe that we’re going to be the leader in AI (artificial intelligence), we’re going to have, it’s estimated, a shortage of 500,000 electricians in this country. So, despite all of this pessimism, the foundation of growth is there. We just need to unlock it… If we cannot unlock that growth and if we’re going to continue to stumble along in a 2% economy, the [national debt is] going to overwhelm this country.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-08T06:36:26,"Why Bitcoin and Ethereum Will Never Compete With XRP in Global Payments","A tweet by crypto researcher SMQKE highlighted a point that is increasingly echoed by both academic research and industry observation: Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are structurally unfit for the demands of modern, high-volume global payments. The evidence presented supports the argument that scalability, cost-efficiency, and regulatory compatibility are critical for any digital asset to be integrated into institutional-grade financial systems. On all of these fronts, XRP significantly outperforms Bitcoin and Ethereum. Scalability Bottlenecks in Bitcoin and Ethereum Scalability, in the context of global payments, refers to the system’s ability to handle millions of transactions simultaneously with speed, reliability, and minimal cost. According to data cited in the images attached to the tweet, both Bitcoin and Ethereum process fewer than 20 transactions per second. This is a major constraint considering that modern banking infrastructure must scale to hundreds of thousands of transactions per second. As noted by IBM’s Lund, while newer systems are achieving up to 4,000 transactions per second in experimental setups, legacy blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum remain severely limited by their foundational architecture. WHY BTC AND ETH WILL NEVER COMPETE WITH XRP IN GLOBAL PAYMENTS Scalability means how well a system can handle lots of transactions at the same time, quickly and without high costs. Banks need this because they process millions of payments every day that must be fast and… https://t.co/N5tjg8GZ64 pic.twitter.com/PnuiSqLZc1 — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) June 5, 2025 Regulatory and Operational Incompatibility The high volatility and low scalability of BTC and ETH are further highlighted in academic literature. A 2022 publication available on Springer concludes that these assets are unsuitable as payment instruments in most distributed ledger technology (DLT) use cases due to these very limitations. Their underlying proof-of-work consensus mechanisms not only limit throughput but also make transaction confirmation times longer and energy consumption unsustainable. These technical deficiencies also create complications for compliance within regulated financial environments, further disqualifying BTC and ETH from institutional adoption in global payment systems. XRP’s Technical Design for Institutional Use In contrast, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) is cited in a separate academic paper on the EDISON-X energy trading system as an example of a DLT built for fast, low-cost, and scalable payments. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRPL uses a Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA) consensus mechanism, which enables transaction finality in 3–4 seconds, with a cost of less than $0.001 per transaction and the capacity to handle up to 1,500 transactions per second. These attributes make XRP suitable not only for peer-to-peer payments but also for enterprise-level applications such as energy trading and cross-border financial settlement. Institutional Preferences and Real-World Integration Furthermore, the scalability and low transaction latency of XRPL are central to its adoption by financial institutions. As highlighted in a Financial Times excerpt shared in the tweet, Ripple engineered its technology from the outset to handle hundreds of thousands of transactions per second. This design goal aligns with the operational requirements of major financial institutions such as Standard Chartered and Bank of America, which necessitate systems that can support large-scale, real-time transaction processing. SMQKE’s tweet argues that Bitcoin and Ethereum were not built for today’s payment environment, and available data supports this claim. XRP, on the other hand, was designed specifically for fast and reliable transactions within regulated frameworks. This distinction explains why banks and regulated financial entities have steered clear of BTC and ETH in operational payment infrastructure, reserving their usage for speculative purposes instead. In summary, technical scalability, regulatory alignment, and settlement efficiency are essential for digital assets to be used in global payments. XRP, through its consensus mechanism and system design, meets the scalability and compliance standards required for institutional adoption, making it a strong candidate for modern payment systems.

2025-06-08T06:30:57,"Still Holding BTC or BNB? Here’s Why Qubetics Might Be the Best Cheap Crypto to Buy Now","Blockchain just took another leap forward. The latest ETH L2 updates are slashing gas fees, and institutions are quietly increasing exposure to digital assets. Meanwhile, newer protocols are drawing in massive TVLs, showing that innovation is sprinting ahead. With the world edging closer to digital-first finance, traditional assets like stocks and bonds aren’t holding the same charm they once did. Instead, crypto projects with strong fundamentals and active communities are emerging as the preferred alternative for everyday buyers. And speaking of strong contenders, Qubetics is gaining serious traction. Positioned at the front of the new digital frontier, Qubetics is the world’s first web3 aggregator, fusing tools and services that power decentralized living. In a world that’s more digitally dependent than ever, this project doesn’t just ride the crypto wave—it builds the next one. Let’s compare Qubetics with the OGs: Bitcoin and BNB, and see which is the best cheap crypto to buy now. How Qubetics’ dVPN Could Be the Breakthrough Web3 Needs Decentralized VPNs (dVPNs) have emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional VPNs, offering censorship resistance, enhanced privacy, and user-driven infrastructure. However, despite their promise, most dVPN solutions today face critical challenges. These include poor user experience, limited network reach, low speeds due to fragmented node quality, and high technical barriers for both node operators and users. Many projects also suffer from weak economic incentives, making it difficult to maintain active, reliable nodes at scale. For the average user, setting up or navigating a dVPN can still feel overly complex and unreliable—limiting real-world adoption. Qubetics addresses these limitations by integrating dVPN functionality into its broader Web3 framework, enabling faster, more reliable, and user-friendly decentralized private networking. Its ecosystem is designed for seamless access—where users can connect to privacy-first routing infrastructure without managing complex setups or relying on underperforming node networks. Qubetics uses a token-based model that rewards node operators fairly while ensuring network stability and scalability. It also supports cross-chain integration and real-time performance validation, allowing users to connect securely across regions and protocols with confidence. For developers and enterprises, Qubetics offers SDK-level access to embed dVPN features directly into decentralized applications, making privacy not just an option, but a default layer within Web3 architecture. Final Presale Stage: From $0.01 to $0.3370—Last Chance Before Listing Qubetics began its presale journey at just $0.01 in Stage 1. Now in Stage 37, the final crypto presale stage, the token is priced at $0.3370, having raised over $17.7 million, distributed 515 million tokens, and attracted 27,500+ holders. Once this final allocation is sold out, $TICS will list publicly at $0.40, offering an immediate return of 18.71% to those buying in now. At the current rate, a $5,000 investment secures approximately 14,837 tokens. If the token reaches $1 post-launch, the value grows to $14,837. At $5, it climbs to $74,185. If it hits $10 or $15, the valuation jumps to $148,370 and $222,555 respectively. With the token supply reduced to 1.36 billion and 38.55% reserved for public distribution, Qubetics offers a rare mix of scarcity, utility, and early-mover advantage. Only 10 million tokens remain at this price—after that, the public market takes over. Bitcoin (BTC): The Unshakable Digital Reserve It’s the original, the heavyweight, the symbol of decentralized money. Still, it has earned its title as digital gold. It’s held by thousands of major buyers, corporate treasuries, and individual wallets worldwide, and it’s got the battle scars to prove it. Bitcoin’s value isn’t just in price. It’s in its network security, its first-mover advantage, and its unmatched decentralization. When markets shake, many still rush to Bitcoin. It’s a mainstay in the digital asset space, but for those scouting for the best cheap crypto to buy now, BTC might be more of a long-term stronghold than a near-term multiplier. The days of 1,000 percent gains might be in the rearview, but for those who want stability in a sea of volatility, Bitcoin continues to be the go-to. BNB (Binance Coin): The Backbone of the Binance Ecosystem BNB started as a utility token and grew into the glue holding the Binance ecosystem together. Whether it’s paying fees on Binance Smart Chain, participating in launches, or powering DeFi and NFT platforms, BNB is everywhere. BNB’s community is huge, with millions of users relying on it for day-to-day transactions across DeFi apps, staking protocols, and token swaps. That kind of use gives BNB real-world weight. It isn’t just speculative—it’s integral to daily blockchain use. But for new backers hunting the best cheap crypto to buy now, BNB may feel a bit pricey compared to tokens like $TICS, especially if the goal is catching early-stage growth. Still, its track record is solid. BNB exploded from a few dollars to hundreds in just a few years, proving that exchange-based tokens can become major players in the space. And with Binance constantly evolving, BNB remains a dependable bet for those looking for something with both utility and staying power. Why Qubetics Is Grabbing All the Spotlight Right Now The ongoing crypto presale of Qubetics has created a ripple effect in crypto circles for a reason. It’s not just about the potential gains. It’s about relevance. This project hits where modern issues lie—privacy, decentralization, access, and usability. Qubetics is the world’s first web3 aggregator, simplifying the decentralized experience into something anyone can use. Think about all the different services out there: VPNs, DeFi wallets, staking platforms, DEXs, aggregators, identity verification. Qubetics brings them under one roof with actual use cases. You’re not just holding a token—you’re part of a platform that does real work in the real world. That’s why it’s being seen as the best cheap crypto to buy now by early adopters who understand where tech is headed. Whether you’re someone who’s sick of handing your data over to centralized services or a professional needing secure, borderless communication, Qubetics delivers. And with each presale stage pushing the price up, those watching from the sidelines are starting to feel the heat. Once this thing hits exchanges, the whole vibe could shift fast. Final Thoughts: Ready or Not, Qubetics Is Coming 2025 isn’t the year to play it safe with tired assets. Between rising inflation and a digital-first future knocking at the door, there’s a growing call for assets that are nimble, tech-forward, and built for where the world is going, not where it’s been. Bitcoin holds the crown for being the pioneer. BNB has cemented its spot in the daily use category. But Qubetics? It’s making a serious case for being the best cheap crypto to buy now , especially for those tuned into real utility and tangible future gains. With massive presale momentum, promising ROI projections, and a platform tackling real-world problems, it’s not just a project—it’s a movement. If you’ve been watching from the sidelines, now’s the moment. The train’s still at the station—but it won’t be for long.

2025-06-08T06:30:52,"Dogecoin’s Growth Pattern Hints At Massive June–July Rally After 5-Month Pullback","Technical analysis of Dogecoin’s price action shows that Dogecoin bulls are currently working hard to register a break above the $0.2 resistance price level. However, beyond the immediate battle at the $0.20 resistance, a broader technical perspective presents a far more interesting possibility of Dogecoin reaching new all-time highs very soon. Specifically, the technical analysis of Dogecoin’s monthly candlestick timeframe chart indicates that its price is currently in the formation of a rally between June and July 2025. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Hit $180,000 In 2025? Analyst Highlights The Trigger Analyst Spots Recurring 3-Month Uptick, 5-Month Pullback Formation A technical analysis of Dogecoin’s monthly candlestick chart, first shared by crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade on the social media platform X, identifies a fascinating recurring pattern for the meme coin’s price. According to the analyst, Dogecoin has now completed two price cycles since late 2023, each consisting of a 3-month pump followed by a 5-month pullback. This rhythmic pattern first played out between December 2023 and August 2024. Dogecoin experienced a strong price surge from December to February, followed by a prolonged pullback that lasted from March to July. It followed a similar trajectory between August 2024 up until recently in May 2025, where three months of bullish momentum were followed by five months of bearish price action. The last monthly candlestick helped to confirm this setup, especially after May ended with a positive 11.7% close from its open price. As such, the next outlook is the continuation of this rally in June 2025. Each of the previous 3-month rallies has produced notable upside, with the most recent cycle in 2024 pushing Dogecoin’s price from below $0.08 to a multi-year high around $0.48 in just three months. If this cyclical behavior continues, Dogecoin could be gearing up for a comparable bullish leg in June and July, which would eventually cause it to break into new all-time highs. Chart Image From X: Trader Tardigrade Dogecoin To Repeat History With June/July Rally The notion that history could repeat itself is not new to crypto traders, but in Dogecoin’s case, the visual alignment of price action over time is hard to ignore. Keeping this possibility in mind, a repeat of the previous rally in Q4 2024 will be enough to send the Dogecoin price above resistance levels at $0.22, $0.3, and finally at $0.48. Related Reading: Elon Musk ‘Will Do Anything’ To Make XRP King, Tech Mogul Says Notably, crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade projected a run-up to $0.3 in June. A successful breach above this level could confirm the start of the next bullish cycle for Dogecoin, and Trader Tardigrade projected a peak price above $0.75 in July 2025. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.184, with a price increase of 0.5% in the past 24 hours.

2025-06-08T05:00:51,"Bitcoin And Ethereum Defend Key Moving Averages – Bullish Signal Or Temporary Relief?","Bitcoin has faced renewed volatility since late May, with the market retracing from recent highs and injecting a fresh dose of uncertainty across the board. While price action has cooled, BTC continues to hold above key levels that bulls are watching closely. The broader sentiment remains fragile, and many investors are on edge, unsure if this is a healthy pause or a setup for deeper downside. Related Reading: Solana Key Indicator Flashes Buy Signal On Daily Chart – Rally Ahead? Analysts are calling for a decisive move above the all-time high to confirm trend continuation, but so far, momentum remains limited. The risk of a further decline still hangs over the market, especially with macro headwinds unresolved and liquidity tight. Top analyst Daan shared a timely technical update, highlighting that both Bitcoin and Ethereum have tested their respective 4-hour 200MA and EMA and bounced. These moving averages are closely watched for short-term trend shifts. The fact that both assets respected them as support could be a subtle but important signal. Still, this bounce needs follow-through. Without a strong push higher, traders may lose conviction, and the window for reclaiming bullish momentum could narrow quickly in the days ahead. Bitcoin Outperforms But Market Risks Loom Bitcoin continues to trade in a tight range just below its all-time high, struggling to break out with conviction but showing clear resilience. Despite repeated attempts from bears, BTC has held above the critical $100,000 psychological level — a key sign of strength as many altcoins lag behind or lose momentum. While some traders remain cautious, Bitcoin’s relative outperformance is beginning to stand out, hinting at the possibility of a decisive move brewing beneath the surface. This strength, however, comes amid rising uncertainty in the broader macro environment. The US economy is entering a more fragile phase, with tightening credit conditions, stubborn inflation, and weakening labor data adding pressure. These developments raise the stakes for risk assets, including Bitcoin, which has historically thrived during expansionary periods but often struggles when liquidity tightens. Daan shared a critical technical update that could help map Bitcoin’s short- and mid-term direction. According to his analysis, both BTC and ETH recently tested their respective 4-hour 200 moving averages (MA) and exponential moving averages (EMA), and successfully bounced from those levels. These indicators are often seen as key dynamic supports during trend formation. If price continues to hold above them, bulls remain in control. But if these levels give way, momentum could flip quickly, opening the door to deeper retracements. For now, the structure still favors the bulls, but the margin for error is shrinking. With Bitcoin holding steady while macro conditions wobble, the next move could set the tone for the rest of the summer. Traders and long-term holders alike should keep an eye on how BTC reacts to these key support zones in the coming days. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Key Range Support After Pullback – Bulls Eye $3,000 Level Bulls Reclaim Key Levels Bitcoin is showing signs of recovery after bouncing from the $103,600 support zone, as seen in the 4-hour chart. The recent drop to this level was met with strong buying interest, triggering a swift rebound. Price is now consolidating around $105,600, having reclaimed both the 200 EMA ($104,924) and the 200 SMA ($104,816), which had previously acted as dynamic resistance during the pullback. This reclaim is a notable technical development and suggests bulls are regaining short-term control. Volume spikes during the bounce add weight to the move, while shorter-term moving averages like the 34 EMA and 50 SMA are now sloping upward, further supporting the bullish case. Still, BTC must break decisively above $106,600 — a recent lower high — to confirm a shift in trend structure.

On the downside, holding $103,600 remains critical. Losing that level would invalidate the current bounce and open the door to a deeper correction below $100,000.

2025-06-08T04:35:02,"Crypto price prediction: Ravencoin, AB token, Keeta","The crypto market held steady during the weekend as traders focused on the upcoming US inflation data, which will determine the next actions by the Federal Reserve. Bitcoin traded at $105,000, while Ethereum’s price moved to $2,500. This article looks at some of the top trending coins like Ravencoin, AB, and Keeta. Ravencoin price analysis Ravencoin is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency created as a hard fork of Bitcoin. Its main difference with Bitcoin is that it has a supply cap of 21 billion, while Bitcoin has 21 million. RVN price surged recently after Upbit, the biggest South Korean exchange, listed it, giving it access to millions of customers. It moved to a high of $0.0257, the highest point since December last year, and then pulled back to $0.01570. Ravencoin price remains slightly above the key resistance level at $0.01428, the highest swing on May 13. It has also jumped above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a sign that bulls remain in control. Ravencoin price chart Ravencoin token also remains above the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level, while the MACD is pointing upwards. Therefore, the coin will likely continue rising as bulls target the 38.2% retracement point at $0.01912. A drop below the support at $0.0142 will invalidate the bullish outlook. Read more: Ravencoin (RVN) is pumping? Is it about Litecoin ETF speculation? AB price forecast AB is a blockchain project that offers a modular technology that supports fast and secure transactions, smart contract execution, and decentralized governance. The AB token price has jumped recently following its listing on several exchanges like Binance, Bitget, and MEXC. It has also done well as on-chain data shows that its network is starting to gow, albeit from a low base. AB has handled over 1.5 million blocks since inception and 29,792 transactions. It is handling about 2.6k transactions a day, while addresses have risen to 23,6111. However, its network utilization remains at 0.01%, meaning that it needs to supercharge its growth to justify its valuation. The daily chart shows that the AB price bottomed at $0.004084 on May 26 and then bounced back to $0.01040. It has moved slightly above the key resistance level at $0.01. The highest point on May 28. AB token price chart The Relative Strength Index and the MACD indicators have all pointed upwards. Therefore, technicals suggest that the AB token will continue rising as bulls target $0.015. However, AB is a thinly traded token, meaning that it may have extreme moves on some days. Keeta price forecast Keeta is a blockchain network that delivers over 10 million transactions per second. Its goal is to unify the blockchain industry by enabling users to move assets across multiple chains. It also lets users to create tokens that represent real-world assets. The two-hour chart shows that the Keeta token price has done well in the past few days as it moved to a record high of $1.4920, up 262% from its lowest point this year. Keeta token recently moved above the key resistance level at $1.2400, its highest point on June 3. Moving above that level invalidated the double-top pattern that was forming. Keeta price chart It has also retested that level, pointing to more gains, potentially to the psychological point at $2. A drop below the support at $1.2400 will invalidate the bullish Keeta price forecast.
