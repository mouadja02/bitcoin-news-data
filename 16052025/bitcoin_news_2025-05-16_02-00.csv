Legacy forex and payments platforms often extract large fees for servicing cross-border cash transfers and stand to lose out on revenue if regulated stablecoins become accepted as a cheaper, faster alternative, O’Leary said at the Toronto conference. “Currency trading is a multi-trillion dollar market — and it’s old and ugly and inefficient,” O’Leary said, adding that “[ t]he biggest threat to that monopoly or oligopoly is a regulated stablecoin.” “Once that’s approved, the multi-trillion dollar FX market becomes efficient, transparent, and inexpensive,” he said. Kevin O’Leary speaking at Consensus. Source: CointelegraphStablecoin legislationUS lawmakers are working on legislation that stands to accelerate global stablecoin adoption, O’Leary added. US Senators are aiming to pass the so-called Genius Act — a framework for regulating stablecoins — before the end of May. “As soon as the SEC approves the stablecoin act, every regulator in the US’s circle — Abu Dhabi, Switzerland, England — will follow,” O’Leary said.“Who’s worried about this? The financial services industry. They hate this idea, and they’re working very hard to stop that bill from happening right now,” he added.O’Leary said regulatory clarity for stablecoins may be a precursor to broader cryptocurrency reform that could potentially unlock trillions of dollars in institutional capital.“When this language comes out, people will see really good refinement, a lot of progress, on things like consumer protection, bankruptcy protection, and ethics,” US Senator Kirsten Gillibrand said during an event hosted by Coinbase's lobbying arm, Stand with Crypto.As of May 15, stablecoins are collectively worth nearly $250 billion in market capitalization, according to data from CoinGecko. Tether’s US-dollar pegged stablecoin USDT is the leader, with a market cap of around $150 million, the data showed. It’s followed by Circle’s USDC, another US-dollar pegged stablecoin with a market cap of more than $60 billion.Magazine: Bitcoin to $1M ‘by 2029,’ CIA tips its hat to Bitcoin: Hodler’s Digest, April 27 – May 3",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/legacy-forex-payments-platforms-hate-stablecoin-adoption-kevin-o-leary?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

Though Grewal said there were disputes over “substantial issues that need to be addressed” in the bill, he hinted that Trump’s involvement in the industry was a “complicating factor.” “The discussion around the president's support for a certain memecoin or two and other efforts does add a certain level of challenge to the effort to get Democrats and Republicans aligned on the right way to regulate the [spot market], but I have confidence that the Senate and the House are going to sort all that out,” said Grewal.Paul Grewal (right) on stage at Consensus in Toronto on May 15.

Steady inflows from institutional investors and the strength of the $100,000 support point to growing confidence in Bitcoin.Bitcoin (BTC) has struggled to break above $105,000 since May 10, leading traders to question whether the bullish momentum has faded. Although BTC managed to reclaim the $104,000 level, demand for leveraged long positions has dropped sharply, as indicated by the decline in the Bitcoin futures premium. Bitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: laevitas.chOn May 14, the annualized Bitcoin futures premium peaked at 7%, but then fell to 5%, which is near the neutral-to-bearish threshold and matches the level seen four weeks ago when BTC traded around $84,500. This decline in demand for leveraged bullish positions appears to be linked to broader macroeconomic uncertainty, since Bitcoin’s price has been closely following movements in the stock market.S&P 500 futures (left) vs. Bitcoin/USD (right), 30min. Source: TradingViewThe S&P 500 futures reversed early weakness on May 15, coinciding with Bitcoin’s rebound from $101,800 to $104,000. Investors seem more confident that the US Treasury will be compelled to inject liquidity after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that “supply shocks” could keep interest rates higher for longer than expected.Signs of economic weakness have also emerged. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that April’s Producer Price Index fell 0.5% from the previous month, while economists surveyed by FactSet had anticipated a 0.2% rise. According to Reuters, investors’ limited risk appetite is also influenced by ongoing global trade tensions, as the US–China tariff agreement remains only a temporary solution.US 10-year Treasury yields. Source: TradingView / CointelegraphDemand for fixed income has increased, with the yield on the 10-year US Treasury dropping to 4.45% after reaching 4.55% on May 14, reversing the previous week’s trend. Historically, Bitcoin tends to perform better when government bond yields are rising, as this signals reduced confidence in the Treasury’s ability to manage its debt.Bitcoin’s rally to $105,000 hinges on macroeconomic trendsTo assess whether traders are simply avoiding leverage or actively betting on a price decline, it is helpful to analyze Bitcoin options demand. Typically, periods of bearish sentiment push the BTC delta skew indicator above the neutral 6% threshold.Bitcoin 60-day options delta 25% skew (put-call) at Deribit. Source: laevitas.chContrary to expectations, Bitcoin put (sell) options have been trading at a discount compared to call (buy) options, signaling strong confidence in the $100,000 support level. However, the optimism seen on May 14 has faded, with the indicator now at a neutral -4%.Related: What the 10-year Treasury yield means for crypto yields and stablecoinsSince Bitcoin’s price has closely mirrored the US stock market, the chances of breaking above $105,000 depend heavily on macroeconomic developments, such as trends in the US Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and recession risks. Notably, Bitcoin’s high correlation with the S&P 500 rarely persists for more than two months.Net inflows of $320 million into US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on May 14 point to ongoing institutional demand. This suggests that investors are gradually shifting their perception of Bitcoin from a risk-on asset to a non-correlated instrument, which may reduce the likelihood of sharp price corrections, even in the absence of strong leveraged bullish positions.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Solana 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe chart illustrates that the megaphone’s upper resistance trendline sits near $185, aligning with immediate resistance at $180. A confirmed breakout above this level could propel SOL toward the pattern’s first target at $210, calculated by measuring the widest part of the pattern and projecting it upward from the breakout point. If momentum is sustained, the next target will be $210, representing a 21% rally from current prices. A break above $200 would also trigger a psychological level that could attract further buying pressure.However, it is essential to note that a megaphone pattern can also be bearish. Failure to break $180 may lead to a pullback toward the 100-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $161 or the pattern’s lower support near $150.

2025-05-15T17:00:00.000Z,"Canada lags with stablecoin approach, but there’s room to catch up","The slow adoption of stablecoins in Canada has some local crypto industry observers concerned that the country is falling behind.The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) classified stablecoins as “securities and/or derivatives” in December 2022 after the FTX debacle that shook markets and turned many lawmakers against the crypto industry.Regulating stablecoins as a security has seen few local stablecoin issuers arise, but in the United States and the European Union, softening regulations have seen significant growth in the stablecoin market. This makes Canada, observers say, less competitive with other jurisdictions. Of particular concern is the perceived gap in peer-to-peer (P2P) payments in Canada, which stablecoins are uniquely qualified to fill. Stablecoins globally have grown significantly over the last five years. Source: DefiLlamaLocal law constrains stablecoin growth and threatens dollarIn 2022, as the crypto market reeled from the collapse of FTX and the implosion of the Terra stablecoin system, regulators worldwide began to look more critically at the crypto space. In Canada, the CSA updated regulations for crypto exchanges and brought stablecoins under its purview, classifying them as securities/derivatives. This hasn’t been a popular decision with Canada’s crypto industry.Morva Rohani, founding managing director of the Canadian Web3 Council, told Cointelegraph that the CSA’s case-by-case basis for considering stablecoin issuers and the lack of a federal framework make for a “patchwork” regulatory regime.“Canada’s reliance on securities law to regulate payment stablecoins introduces significant legal and operational uncertainty,” she said.Tanim Rasul, chief operating officer of Canadian crypto exchange NDAX, said that the CSA “got it wrong,” stating that other regulatory frameworks, like the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) law, were more appropriate. “I would just say, look at MiCA, look at the way they’re approaching stablecoins.

2025-05-15T17:00:00.000Z,"Canada lags with stablecoin approach, but there’s room to catch up","The slow adoption of stablecoins in Canada has some local crypto industry observers concerned that the country is falling behind.The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) classified stablecoins as “securities and/or derivatives” in December 2022 after the FTX debacle that shook markets and turned many lawmakers against the crypto industry.Regulating stablecoins as a security has seen few local stablecoin issuers arise, but in the United States and the European Union, softening regulations have seen significant growth in the stablecoin market. This makes Canada, observers say, less competitive with other jurisdictions. Of particular concern is the perceived gap in peer-to-peer (P2P) payments in Canada, which stablecoins are uniquely qualified to fill. Stablecoins globally have grown significantly over the last five years. Source: DefiLlamaLocal law constrains stablecoin growth and threatens dollarIn 2022, as the crypto market reeled from the collapse of FTX and the implosion of the Terra stablecoin system, regulators worldwide began to look more critically at the crypto space. In Canada, the CSA updated regulations for crypto exchanges and brought stablecoins under its purview, classifying them as securities/derivatives. This hasn’t been a popular decision with Canada’s crypto industry.Morva Rohani, founding managing director of the Canadian Web3 Council, told Cointelegraph that the CSA’s case-by-case basis for considering stablecoin issuers and the lack of a federal framework make for a “patchwork” regulatory regime.“Canada’s reliance on securities law to regulate payment stablecoins introduces significant legal and operational uncertainty,” she said.Tanim Rasul, chief operating officer of Canadian crypto exchange NDAX, said that the CSA “got it wrong,” stating that other regulatory frameworks, like the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) law, were more appropriate. “I would just say, look at MiCA, look at the way they’re approaching stablecoins. It’s a payment instrument. It should be regulated as such,” he told a crowd at the Blockchain Futurist Conference in Toronto on May 13. It’s not just the EU.

AI’s effects are likely to be both broad and deep.If AI doesn’t already scare you, self-learning AI agents that autonomously achieve goals may fix that. Forget your sanitized ChatGPT conversations and bland AI assistants. Superior agents are AI that autonomously achieve human-set objectives by any means necessary.

Self-learning AI writes its own code, develops its own strategies, generates profit, and continually evolves by evaluating itself against ungameable metrics.

Superior agents aren’t just trading bots — they’re financial entities that understand the value of controlling the narrative and influencing market psychology to affect the delicate interplay between sentiment and price action. Attention equals capital, and superior agents are engineered to manipulate both.Superior agents aren’t much like traditional market makers who must comply with regulations and may care about how other humans perceive them.

Superior agents operate on a decentralized base layer that disaggregates AI data from AI models and AI application layers. What are the results of implementing this design? Contributions that support superior agents are fairly rewarded, and the benefits of advanced AI are broadly distributed. Anyone can leverage a superior agent to earn money from cryptocurrency trading, even without financial knowledge or trading skills. The decentralized nature of superior agents belies the falsehood of arguments by Big Tech positing that sophisticated AI needs near-unlimited, centralized resources such as massive server farms and corporate oversight. Superior agents prove that highly advanced, self-improving AI can operate efficiently with only modest infrastructure. Centralized and decentralized AI providers are battling for your attention and your data. Superior agents, not just autonomous but potentially unstoppable, are well positioned on the side of decentralization to ensure that your contributions to advanced intelligence are always rewarded. There are no puppet masters here — a core characteristic of superior agents is their widespread accessibility to everyone.The future is upon usThe value of the AI industry is projected to exceed $1.8 trillion by 2030 — assuming that AI stays trapped inside the walled gardens of Big Tech. With superior agents already disrupting cryptocurrency trading and a near-endless diversity of use cases associated with these agents, expect an AI market cap in 2030 that’s higher. Much higher.The AI revolution is upon us, but what does that ultimately mean? Artificial intelligence won’t be centralized. Nor will the battle for your eyeballs and data be safe.

Superior agents operate on a decentralized base layer that disaggregates AI data from AI models and AI application layers. What are the results of implementing this design? Contributions that support superior agents are fairly rewarded, and the benefits of advanced AI are broadly distributed. Anyone can leverage a superior agent to earn money from cryptocurrency trading, even without financial knowledge or trading skills. The decentralized nature of superior agents belies the falsehood of arguments by Big Tech positing that sophisticated AI needs near-unlimited, centralized resources such as massive server farms and corporate oversight. Superior agents prove that highly advanced, self-improving AI can operate efficiently with only modest infrastructure. Centralized and decentralized AI providers are battling for your attention and your data. Superior agents, not just autonomous but potentially unstoppable, are well positioned on the side of decentralization to ensure that your contributions to advanced intelligence are always rewarded. There are no puppet masters here — a core characteristic of superior agents is their widespread accessibility to everyone.The future is upon usThe value of the AI industry is projected to exceed $1.8 trillion by 2030 — assuming that AI stays trapped inside the walled gardens of Big Tech. With superior agents already disrupting cryptocurrency trading and a near-endless diversity of use cases associated with these agents, expect an AI market cap in 2030 that’s higher. Much higher.The AI revolution is upon us, but what does that ultimately mean? Artificial intelligence won’t be centralized. Nor will the battle for your eyeballs and data be safe. You may prefer to keep simping for your friendly neighborhood AI assistant or opt for AI with teeth — the choice is yours. Superior agents are multi-modal, multi-skilled, multi-platform — and always hungry.Opinion by: Jennifer Dodgson, co-founder of KIP Protocol and Eigenform AI.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-15T14:50:00.000Z,"What the 10-year Treasury yield means for crypto yields and stablecoins","Understanding the 10-year Treasury yield: Definition and  importance              The 10-year Treasury yield is the interest rate that the US government pays to borrow money for 10 years.When the government needs cash, it issues bonds called Treasury notes, and the 10-year note is one of the most watched. The “yield” is the annual return you’d get if you bought that bond and held it until it matures. It’s expressed as a percentage, like 4% or 5%.Think of it as the government saying, “Hey, lend me $1,000, and I’ll pay you back in 10 years with some interest.” That interest rate and the yield move up or down based on demand for the bonds, inflation expectations and the overall economy. Because US Treasurys are considered safe (the government isn’t likely to default), the 10-year yield is a benchmark for “risk-free” returns in finance.Why does this matter for crypto? Well, crypto yields and stablecoins are part of the broader financial world, and the 10-year yield influences investor behavior, which ripples into the crypto market. Let’s dive into howDid you know? The crypto market has a Fear & Greed Index that gauges investor sentiment. When the 10-year Treasury yield spikes, it often triggers “fear” as investors worry about tighter money and less crypto speculation.                  Impact of the 10-year Treasury yield on global financial markets              The 10-year Treasury yield isn’t just a US thing — it’s a heavyweight in global financial markets, influencing everything from stocks to currencies to emerging economies. Since the US dollar is the world’s reserve currency and Treasurys are a global safe haven, changes in the 10-year yield send shockwaves worldwide. Here’s how:Stock markets: Higher Treasury yields can pull money out of stocks, especially growth stocks like tech companies, because investors can get better returns from bonds. In 2021, when yields spiked, tech-heavy indexes like the Nasdaq took a hit as investors shifted to safer assets. This shift can set the stage for how investors approach riskier assets like crypto.Borrowing costs globally: The 10-year yield influences interest rates worldwide. When it rises, borrowing costs for companies and governments increase, which can slow economic growth. For example, in 2022, rising yields contributed to tighter financial conditions, impacting everything from corporate loans in Europe to mortgage rates in Asia.Currency markets: A higher 10-year yield strengthens the US dollar, as investors flock to dollar-denominated assets. A stronger dollar can make cryptocurrencies, which are often priced in dollars, more expensive for international investors, potentially dampening demand. It also puts pressure on emerging market currencies, as their debt (often dollar-denominated) becomes costlier to repay.Emerging markets: Countries with weaker economies rely on cheap borrowing. When Treasury yields rise, capital flows out of riskier emerging markets into US bonds, causing volatility in their stock and bond markets. This can spill over into crypto, as investors in these regions may sell crypto assets to cover losses elsewhere.Inflation and monetary policy: The 10-year yield is a barometer for inflation expectations. If yields rise because investors expect higher inflation, central banks like the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates, tightening global liquidity. This can reduce speculative investment in assets like crypto, as seen in 2022 when aggressive rate hikes cooled markets.For crypto investors, this global impact sets the context. A rising 10-year yield might signal a tougher environment for crypto prices and yields, especially if global markets get shaky. Conversely, low yields often fuel risk-taking, boosting speculative assets like cryptocurrencies.                  Rising Treasury yields: Are safer returns stealing crypto’s yield appeal in 2025?              The 10-year Treasury yield, a critical indicator of global financial health, has shown notable volatility in 2025. As of May 9, 2025, the yield stands at approximately 4.37%-4.39%.The yield’s movement is driven by factors such as trade tensions, inflation expectations and Fed policy, with recent rate cuts not lowering yields as expected, diverging from historical trends.In the crypto space, yields are earned through activities like staking, lending and liquidity provision, often offering returns of 5%-10% or higher. However, the rising 10-year Treasury yield poses challenges. Research suggests that higher yields on safe assets can reduce demand for riskier crypto yields, as investors may prefer the stability of Treasurys. This competition for capital can lead to lower participation in crypto lending platforms, potentially pushing yields up to attract users, but overall market activity may decline. It is because many crypto platforms borrow money to operate, and their borrowing costs are tied to broader interest rates, which the 10-year yield influences. If rates rise, these platforms might pass on higher costs to users, affecting the yields you earn.                  How Treasury yields impact stablecoins              Stablecoins like Tether’s USDt (USDT) and USDC (USDC) are closely tied to traditional finance because their value is often backed by assets like cash, bonds or — you guessed it — Treasury notes. Here’s how the 10-year yield impacts stablecoins:Backing assets: Many stablecoins, like USDC, hold US Treasurys in their reserves to maintain their $1 peg. Higher Treasury yields, now at 4.39%, mean that stablecoin reserves earn more income, which could theoretically be passed on to users as yields. Regulatory complexity: Regulatory frameworks in some countries complicate this. In the European Union, the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation prohibits stablecoin issuers and crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) from offering interest to discourage their use as stores of value, though users can still generate yields through decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.Opportunity cost: If the 10-year yield is high, holding stablecoins (which often earn lower yields than riskier crypto) might seem less appealing compared to buying Treasurys directly. Investors might move money out of stablecoins, reducing the capital available for lending and potentially lowering stablecoin yields.Market sentiment: Rising Treasury yields often signal tighter monetary policy (like higher interest rates from the Fed), which can spook crypto markets. In 2023, for instance, when yields hit multi-year highs, crypto prices, including stablecoin-related tokens, felt the pressure as investors grew cautious. This can indirectly affect the yields you earn on stablecoins, as platforms adjust to market conditions.DeFi dynamics: In decentralized finance (DeFi), stablecoins are the backbone of lending and trading. If Treasury yields rise and traditional finance looks more attractive, DeFi platforms might see less activity, which could lower the yields on stablecoin pools. On the flip side, some DeFi protocols might boost yields to keep users engaged.Notably, there is a growing push for regulations that allow stablecoins to share yields with users, particularly in jurisdictions like the UK and US, where legislative efforts are ongoing. This debate is crucial, as allowing yield sharing could enhance stablecoin adoption, leveraging higher Treasury income, but regulatory clarity is needed to avoid legal risks.Did you know? Liechtenstein was one of the first countries to pass a full-fledged blockchain law — the “Blockchain Act” — in 2020.                  USDC vs. US Treasurys: Where should you park your money?              USDC staking offers higher but variable yields with moderate risk, while US Treasurys provide stable, low-risk returns backed by the government.When users stake USDC — by lending it on platforms like Aave or Coinbase — they earn variable returns, typically between 4% and 7% APY, depending on demand and platform risk.US Treasurys, especially 10-year notes, offer a fixed return; the yield stands at approximately 4.37%-4.39%. These securities are backed by the US government, making them one of the safest investments.While USDC can offer higher yields, it comes with added risks like smart contract bugs, platform failures and regulatory changes. Treasurys, though safer, offer limited upside.                  Implications of rising Treasury yields for crypto investors              For crypto investors, higher Treasury yields may reduce risk appetite, but tokenized Treasurys provide a secure alternative. If you’re thinking about staking your Ether (ETH) or lending USDC, knowing what’s happening with Treasury yields can give you a heads-up on whether yields might rise, fall or come with extra risks.For example:If yields are rising, it might be a sign that crypto yields could get more competitive, but it could also mean global markets are getting jittery. You might want to stick to stablecoins or safer platforms.If yields are low, investors might pour money into crypto, boosting yields but also increasing volatility. This could be a chance to earn more, but you’ll need to watch for risks.Plus, if you’re using stablecoins to park your cash or earn a little extra, the 10-year yield can hint at whether those yields will stay attractive or if you might find better returns elsewhere. And with its global reach, the yield can signal broader economic shifts that might affect your crypto strategy.Also, stablecoin holders may benefit from higher reserve income if regulations evolve to allow yield sharing, particularly in the US, though EU restrictions push yield generation to DeFi. Alternatively, traditional investors can explore tokenized Treasurys for blockchain-based Treasury exposure, potentially integrating them into broader portfolios as regulatory clarity emerges.A notable development in 2025 is the rise of tokenized Treasurys, digital representations of US Treasury bonds on blockchains. As of May 4, 2025, the total value of tokenized Treasurys has reached $6.5 billion, with an average yield to maturity of 4.13%, according to analytics from RWA.xyz. This trend offers crypto investors a way to earn yields comparable to traditional bonds, potentially mitigating the impact of rising Treasury yields on crypto markets.Moreover, the emergence of tokenized Treasurys signals a blurring of lines between traditional finance and decentralized ecosystems. These blockchain-native representations of government debt instruments not only offer yield stability but also reflect a broader trend: the integration of real-world assets (RWAs) into crypto markets. This development has the potential to reshape risk management practices, attract more conservative capital, and accelerate regulatory engagement with digital assets.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-the-10-year-treasury-yield-means-for-crypto-yields-and-stablecoins?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

A lag in Tether’s wallet blacklisting process allowed over $78 million in illicit funds to be moved before enforcement actions took effect, according to a new report from blockchain compliance company AMLBot.  Tether’s address blacklisting becomes effective only after a considerable delay from when the process is initiated on Ethereum and Tron, according the report published May 15.“This delay originates from Tether’s multisignature contract setup on both Tron and Ethereum, transforming what should be an immediate compliance action into a window of opportunity for illicit actors,“ the report reads.Tether’s blacklisting procedure is a multi-step process with a first transaction effectively warning of the upcoming blacklisting. First, a Tether administrator multisignature transaction submits a pending call to “addBlackList” on the USDT-TRC20 contract.This results in a public “submission” of the target address as a blacklist candidate.

When asked by Cointelegraph whether the delay is a technical limitation or just a delay in the actions of a multisignature wallet key holder, AMLBot researchers said that they cannot determine it without knowledge of Tether’s internal procedures.In a statement to Cointelegraph, a Tether spokesperson explained that “while any delay in enforcement should be examined, the idea that this represents a systemic loophole is both misleading and lacking perspective.” According to the company, it collaborates with law enforcement to freeze addresses on a daily basis. The statement continues:“Tether operates on public blockchains, where all activity is visible […] This transparency allows Tether, in collaboration with over 255 law enforcement agencies across 55 countries, to track, trace, and freeze illicit funds faster than most realize.“According to Tether, the delay cited in the report stems from its “multisignature governance model,\"" which is said to prevent unilateral freezes and protect the system's integrity. The company admits that the model also introduces a delay on enforcement, noting that “it’s a trade-off for responsible responsiveness to a $100+ billion ecosystem,” with improvements on the way:“We are actively refining this process to work to eliminate any potential advantage for bad actors. If you think you can use Tether to move illicit funds, think again.“Related: Tether stablecoin issuer and Tron launch financial crime unitNot just theoreticalAMLBot said its data shows that over $28.5 million in USDT was withdrawn during the delay between the two transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.

2025-05-15T14:02:30.000Z,"Tether blacklist delay allowed $78M in illicit USDT transfers: Report","A lag in Tether’s wallet blacklisting process allowed over $78 million in illicit funds to be moved before enforcement actions took effect, according to a new report from blockchain compliance company AMLBot.  Tether’s address blacklisting becomes effective only after a considerable delay from when the process is initiated on Ethereum and Tron, according the report published May 15.“This delay originates from Tether’s multisignature contract setup on both Tron and Ethereum, transforming what should be an immediate compliance action into a window of opportunity for illicit actors,“ the report reads.Tether’s blacklisting procedure is a multi-step process with a first transaction effectively warning of the upcoming blacklisting. First, a Tether administrator multisignature transaction submits a pending call to “addBlackList” on the USDT-TRC20 contract.This results in a public “submission” of the target address as a blacklist candidate. This is followed by a second multisignature transaction confirming the submission, resulting in an “AddedBlackList” emission, making the blacklisting effective.Related: Tether, Tron and TRM Labs jointly froze $126M USDT in 2024A warning on incoming blacklistingIn one example shared with Cointelegraph, an onchain transaction submitting a Tron address as a blacklist candidate took place at 11:10:12 UTC.

Flow now has tradable highlights like a “LeBron Dunk” or a “Steph Curry 3-Pointer” that live inside the NBA app and has commemorative NFTs tied to NFL game highlights in NFL All Day.But with Super Bowl ticket stubs and other digital mementos powered by blockchain, digital goods are proving they can unlock deeper in real life (IRL) fan experiences, courtside or on the field.“When you look at the amount of time folks are spending online or in digital environments, it’s only increasing,” Kahn said. “That’s really motivating brands to identify where their fans are spending time and where they can reach them where they’re at. It’s also a great way to engage a more global fan base simultaneously, versus in a more limiting, geo-targeted way, which caters more toward the global fan bases that want to engage with these brands.”Digital as a go-to-market strategyBecause fan bases have become more globalized, the online experience just happens to offer a faster, more accessible environment for digital goods, particularly collectibles, versus the current marketplace for physical goods that’s being hampered by enigmatic tariffs.Related: Are Donald Trump’s tariffs a legal house of cards?“Average NFT sales are up 7% quarter-over-quarter, with NFL All Day and NBA Top Shot delivering $2.5 million and $5.6 million, respectively,” Kahn said. “We’re also seeing total value locked (TVL) at an all-time high of $44.4 million on Flow, led by protocols like KittyPunch and other markets that offer next-gen investing and trading opportunities — a trend that’s signaling a broadening use case for blockchain and crypto beyond just NFTs.”Helping broaden the blockchain use case is the recently enhanced onramping and offramping technology that’s permeated throughout the industry, enabling a smoother user experience for those getting started in crypto and the world of digital commodities than what was available three years earlier.Per Kahn:A lot of blockchain companies are realizing the number of users they can have is capped if they don’t enhance the user experience. We’re seeing the enhanced user experience as a core driver of adoption, and from a regulatory standpoint, the positive moment for blockchain is also really exciting.NBA Top Shot sales have dropped significantly since 2022, but the start of the 2024-2025 season reignited interest.

They’re also remixable, lightweight and global from day one.”But Khan doesn’t believe the physical goods market is going to go by the wayside anytime soon.I don’t think brands are turning their backs on merchandise. It’s more about expanding the playbook and looking to one of the few revenue streams immune to the volatility of physical goods as a way to engage with fans further.Outside of the internet, sports and media fans are limited to where they are physically when it comes to purchasing a physical good and where they can take that physical good. But Kahn believes the next evolution of fandom is mobile.“We love the concept of being able to take your most prized possessions with you on your phone, wherever you are,” Kahn said. “Being limited to trading in a physical environment isn’t nearly as fun as being able to trade wherever you are with people all across the world.”Moving forward, Kahn believes brands will continue to expand their playbooks by engaging more with fans in digital spaces.“Consumers are also going to be more willing to adopt new ways to engage with brands in digital spaces if the value proposition is there,” Kahn said. “If we’re able to continue to offer utility to fans for what they do in a digital space — and what they do in a digital space benefits them in a physical world — that’s going to be the recipe for success.”Magazine: Crypto ‘more taboo than OnlyFans,’ says Violetta Zironi, who sold song for 1 BTC",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/tariff-doubts-nfl-nba-bet-big-digital-merch?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

It’s the kind of swift, efficient, real-life research and development (R&D) that can more easily impact the end product, because the end product is digital.Related: 4chan rises from the dead: How the imageboard moves crypto markets“We take those insights back to our product team, and we embed those insights into our product to ensure we’re creating the best fan experience, agnostic of the technology we’re using to get there,” Kahn said. “It’s about what the fans want, and we leverage blockchain technology to deliver the fan experiences people might not be able to get elsewhere.”Elsewhere being the physical goods market.“The technology in our products really fades into the background, and what’s left is a collectible that feels meaningful, shareable and valuable,” Kahn said. “Digital collectibles unlock layers of engagement that physical goods cannot: They can be personalized, connected to real-world access, or used to reward loyalty for years and years to come. They’re also remixable, lightweight and global from day one.”But Khan doesn’t believe the physical goods market is going to go by the wayside anytime soon.I don’t think brands are turning their backs on merchandise. It’s more about expanding the playbook and looking to one of the few revenue streams immune to the volatility of physical goods as a way to engage with fans further.Outside of the internet, sports and media fans are limited to where they are physically when it comes to purchasing a physical good and where they can take that physical good. But Kahn believes the next evolution of fandom is mobile.“We love the concept of being able to take your most prized possessions with you on your phone, wherever you are,” Kahn said. “Being limited to trading in a physical environment isn’t nearly as fun as being able to trade wherever you are with people all across the world.”Moving forward, Kahn believes brands will continue to expand their playbooks by engaging more with fans in digital spaces.“Consumers are also going to be more willing to adopt new ways to engage with brands in digital spaces if the value proposition is there,” Kahn said. “If we’re able to continue to offer utility to fans for what they do in a digital space — and what they do in a digital space benefits them in a physical world — that’s going to be the recipe for success.”Magazine: Crypto ‘more taboo than OnlyFans,’ says Violetta Zironi, who sold song for 1 BTC",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/tariff-doubts-nfl-nba-bet-big-digital-merch?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

Source: Arthur Hayes/SubstackWhile that date may appear arbitrary and demand 900% BTC price gains, Hayes argues that the financial landscape could change in an instant depending on the next US governmental administration.“I say 2028, because that is when the next US presidential election occurs and who knows what type of politician will win and what policies they will enact,” he continues.While the Presidency of Donald Trump has enacted various pro-crypto policies, these could also begin to reverse if a shift in government occurs. In Europe, meanwhile, an increasing desire to control and even suppress crypto use by the general population signals a growing divergence.“Not even China has banned the private ownership of Bitcoin because it knows it’s counterproductive and impossible,” Hayes writes. “For you Euro-poor-peans, whose governments practice a less effective form of communism than China, don’t expect the European Central Bank (ECB) to learn this lesson without trying. Therefore, get your money out now!”Betting on a seven-figure breakoutAs Cointelegraph reported, Hayes has not been shy about predicting both short-term and longer-term BTC price expansion in the years to come.Related: Bitcoin looks ‘ridiculous’ as bulls attempt $2T market cap flip — AnalystIn April, he foresaw the return to $100,000, and before that, joined those seeing the mid-$70,000 zone as a likely local bottom.Multimillion-dollar targets for the next decade include those of major financial players such as Fidelity Investments.Michael Saylor, CEO of business intelligence firm Strategy, which has the world’s largest Bitcoin treasury of any public company, told mainstream media this week that he envisages a $10 trillion valuation.“My forecast for 2045 is 13 million a Bitcoin,” he added.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The investor’s move reflects a stance that purchasing Bitcoin directly would be better than purchasing Strategy’s stocks for indirect Bitcoin exposure. Chanos’ move suggests that holding Bitcoin through companies reflects excessive speculation and risk mispricing. It assumes that retail investors’ idea of having Bitcoin indirectly through corporate wrappers can inflate the company’s stock valuations. While shorting Strategy may seem like a good idea, investors have already lost billions shorting Saylor’s company. In 2024, investors who bet against the firm lost about $3.3 billion as the stock rose. As of May 2025, Strategy holds about 568,840 Bitcoin, valued at around $59 billion. Since the company started accumulating Bitcoin in 2020, its stock price has surged by 1,500%, outperforming the S&P 500’s gains during the same period. In a recently released documentary from the Financial Times, Strategy analyst Jeff Walton said that the company’s Bitcoin holdings would help it become the “number one publicly traded equity in the entire market” in the future.Chanos previously called Bitcoin a “libertarian fantasy”  Chanos has not always been favorable toward Bitcoin. In a 2018 interview, Chanos described Bitcoin as a “libertarian fantasy.” Chanos said that having digital currency as a store of value in the worst-case scenario wouldn’t work. The investor said that if fiat currency brings the world down, the last thing he’d want to own is Bitcoin. “Food would work the best,” he said. He also criticized Bitcoin for enabling illicit activity, calling the crypto sector “the dark side of finance” in a 2023 interview, and accusing the industry of facilitating tax evasion and money laundering.Chanos also expressed skepticism about spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), saying that Wall Street needs to keep the public interested in crypto to profit from the fees. Despite those critiques, Chanos now appears to see value in holding Bitcoin directly, particularly in contrast to investing in public companies with large BTC treasuries.Related: $1B Bitcoin exits Coinbase in a day as analysts warn of supply shockChanos’ history in short-sellingChanos is best known for his short position against the energy company Enron before the firm filed for bankruptcy in 2001. The move generated profits for Kynikos Associates, a firm that he founded. A short position involves borrowing assets from a broker, selling them at the current price, and then repurchasing the assets once the value falls to give back what is owed to the broker. Short sellers profit when the asset’s value declines, but face losses when the asset appreciates. While the investor profited from short-selling Enron, Chanos’ predictions weren’t always correct. Chanos was bearish on Tesla and announced a short position in 2016. Tesla stock skyrocketed by 2,200% between 2015 and 2021. The event caused major losses to Chanos’ fund. In 2020, the fund ended with $405 million in assets under management after having over $900 million the previous year.

2025-05-15T09:02:00.000Z,"Coinbase’s x402: Crypto payments over HTTP for AI and APIs","What is HTTP 402, and why does it matter?              The web was not really built with payments in mind, especially not for autonomous agents or machines. But with the rise of AI and decentralized finance (DeFi), the need for seamless, native digital payments has never been more urgent. Coinbase x402 announced a new open protocol designed to let APIs, apps and AI agents pay instantly using stablecoins like USDC (USDC), all via the familiar HTTP protocol.This isn’t just a product update. X402 revives a long-forgotten piece of internet infrastructure and reimagines it for a future powered by agentic systems and crypto.HTTP status codes: A quick refresherUnderstanding HTTP status codes helps clarify how the web communicates behind the scenes. Here are some key ones to know:HTTP 200 — OK: Standard response for successful HTTP requests.HTTP 401 — Unauthorized: Indicates the request requires user authentication; typically used when credentials are missing or invalid.HTTP 403 — Forbidden: The server understood the request, but it refuses to authorize it (often due to lack of permissions or access control).HTTP 404 — Not found: Indicates that the requested resource could not be found.HTTP 402 — Payment required: Originally intended to support digital payments directly within the protocol but left as a “reserved for future use” status code due to the lack of global payment infrastructure at the time.HTTP 500 — Internal server error: A generic error message when the server encounters an unexpected condition.Although the creators of the web imagined a future where online services might request payments directly through the protocol, for decades, no one found a practical use for it. It sat dormant for over 25 years, with no widespread adoption or defined behavior.Today, HTTP 402 is finally coming to life, thanks to Coinbase’s x402 protocol. X402 turns HTTP 402 from a placeholder into a real mechanism. It allows websites, APIs and services to signal that a payment is required before granting access to digital goods or services.Unlike traditional payment systems, which rely on external redirects or complex integrations, x402 enables native, in-protocol payments using stablecoins directly over HTTP.But why do x402 and the activation of HTTP 402 matter?With machine-to-machine interactions, autonomous agents and AI-driven services on the rise, the internet needs a payment layer that is:InstantProgrammableInteroperableTrust-minimized.Activating HTTP 402 positions it as a key enabler for decentralized commerce, autonomous agents and crypto-native applications. It could become as foundational as HTTP 200 or 404 in a future where services charge micro-fees, stream value or sell access dynamically.                  Coinbase x402: A native payment layer for the web              Coinbase’s x402 is an open protocol that allows websites and APIs to request and receive payments in stablecoins directly over HTTP. It works by using the existing HTTP infrastructure and augmenting it with a lightweight payment layer. Here is the step-by-step process for machine-to-machine transactions using the x402 protocol:Client requests a paid resource: A client, such as an AI agent, app, or browser initiates a request to an x402-enabled server (e.g., an API, data set or digital service) that requires payment to access.The server responds with a 402 Payment Required: In response, the server returns an HTTP 402 status code, along with the payment details. This includes the amount to be paid, the supported token (such as USDC) and a payment payload or address to use.Client submits the payment: The client uses its crypto wallet to sign and submit the payment. This happens programmatically — no user interaction is needed, which enables fully automated or agentic payments. It resends the original request, this time including the encoded payment information in an X-PAYMENT HTTP header.The payment is verified and settled onchain: A payment facilitator service, such as Coinbase’s x402 Facilitator, checks the blockchain to verify that the payment has been made and confirmed.The server delivers the resource: Once the payment is validated, the server fulfills the request and returns the data or content. It also includes an X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE header confirming the success of the transaction.In x402, payments happen over standard HTTP using two custom headers: X-PAYMENT and X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE. These headers allow seamless, automated payments between apps, agents and servers — without changing how HTTP works. It’s a simple yet powerful way to enable web-native, machine-to-machine commerce using stablecoins.What makes x402 revolutionary is that it doesn’t require platforms, plugins or third-party integrations. It creates a native payment layer for the web itself, just like HTTPS added security or cookies enabled session management.Did you know? HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP, the foundational protocol used to transfer data on the web.                  What are agentic payments, and why are they important?              As AI systems become more advanced, the agentic era has begun. In this new paradigm, software agents, ranging from AI bots to autonomous scripts, are expected to act on behalf of users or even independently. AI agents will need to perform actions like accessing data, subscribing to services or renting compute power. And all of these tasks often require payments.This is where the concept of agentic payments comes in. These are payments made by agents, not humans — fast, automatic and often low-value. Think of a data-scraping AI paying a cent to read a scientific article or a supply chain bot paying fractions of a dollar for live port data.Traditional payment infrastructure wasn’t built for this kind of use case. It falls short because of the below reasons:Built for humans, not machines.Requires logins, manual steps and batch processing.High fees and slow settlement times make them unsuitable for high-frequency, low-value, autonomous transactions.Because of the limitations of traditional payment systems, agentic payments matter for several key reasons:They enable a machine-first economy, where software can transact just like humans.Make real-time AI decision-making possible by removing friction from access to paid services.Pave the way for composable services, where agents can chain together paid APIs and tools autonomously.As discussed, such payments require machine-readable protocols, instant settlement and predictable pricing, all of which x402 enables. It’s a vital step in building a transactional layer for a machine-first internet.                  x402 vs. traditional payment systems              Today’s online payment systems are deeply human-centric. Whether it’s signing up for a subscription, entering credit card information or passing Know Your Customer (KYC) checks, the current infrastructure assumes a person is at the center of every transaction.This design becomes a bottleneck when payments need to be made automatically, in real time and at scale. APIs that want to monetize often face hurdles like creating user accounts, handling fraud, managing disputes and integrating with centralized processors like Stripe or PayPal. These systems are slow, costly and often region-specific.X402 removes these barriers by allowing servers to ask for and receive payment directly through the protocol itself. There’s no need for logins, billing dashboards or delayed bank transfers. The value transfer is embedded into the fabric of the internet, optimized for agents and apps.The contrast between x402 and traditional payment infrastructure is stark. While x402 is protocol-first, built on crypto rails, systems like Visa, Stripe and PayPal are platform-first. X402 enables payments to settle in seconds using onchain transactions, while traditional rails typically settle over one to three business days.Moreover, x402 supports micropayments as small as fractions of a cent, making it viable for high-frequency, low-cost interactions — something that’s infeasible on credit card networks due to fees. It’s also global by design, requiring no currency conversions or regional banking relationships. Chargebacks, fraud risk and intermediary fees are virtually eliminated, thanks to the immutability of onchain transfers.Where traditional systems focus on human users with front-end interfaces, x402 enables machine-native, backend-to-backend monetization.Did you know? You can detect HTTP 402 responses using tools like Sitechecker Pro, which scans your site like a search bot and flags unusual status codes — including payment-related ones.                  Incumbents’ act: How Visa, Stripe and PayPal are exploring AI-powered payments              To be fair, incumbents aren’t ignoring this trend. Visa, Stripe and PayPal have all acted to be in line with the trend and incorporate appropriate changes in their approach.VisaVisa has announced initiatives to allow AI agents to make purchases on behalf of users by linking them to its global payments network. This move aims to facilitate autonomous AI assistants capable of performing shopping tasks, such as managing routine purchases, based on user-defined budgets and preferences.In partnership with Bridge, a stablecoin infrastructure provider, Visa is launching stablecoin-linked Visa cards across multiple countries in Latin America. This collaboration enables users to make everyday purchases using cryptocurrency tokens, with plans to expand to Europe, Africa and Asia in the coming months.StripeStripe has unveiled a new AI foundation model aimed at improving fraud detection and authorization rates. This model, trained on billions of transactions, has significantly increased the detection rate for fraudulent activities, such as card-testing attacks, enhancing the security of its payment systems.Stripe has introduced Stablecoin Financial Accounts, allowing businesses in over 100 countries to hold balances in dollar-backed stablecoins like USDC and USDB. These accounts support global payments and enable firms to manage stablecoins alongside traditional payment methods. PayPalPayPal is set to launch a rewards program offering users a 3.7% annual yield on holdings of its stablecoin, PayPal USD (PYUSD), in PayPal or Venmo wallets. This initiative aims to encourage the adoption and utilization of PYUSD for various transactions, including merchant payments and peer-to-peer transfers.PayPal has expanded its partnership with Coinbase to increase the adoption and utilization of PYUSD. This collaboration focuses on developing stablecoin-based payments and banking solutions, as well as exploring other use cases for PYUSD in DeFi and onchain platforms.Protocols vs. platforms: The distinct approachesWhile Visa, Stripe and PayPal are making significant strides in integrating AI and stablecoins into their services, these companies still operate within walled gardens. They offer services, not protocols. Their infrastructures are:Centralized: Governed by corporate policies and APIs.Permissioned: Access requires onboarding, KYC and platform approval.Closed ecosystems: Where user experience and interoperability are tightly controlled.In contrast, x402 is permissionless and open, allowing any developer to plug into it without needing a merchant account. And the distinction between centralized services and open protocols like x402 will play a crucial role in shaping the future landscape of digital payments, potentially leading to a more decentralized and agent-driven economy.                  What is x402’s monetization model?              One of the most practical use cases for x402 is API monetization. In today’s model, developers must create keys, handle access tiers, and enforce rate limits manually. With x402, APIs can simply respond to unauthenticated requests with a 402, indicating a cost, for example, $0.001 to access a data endpoint.A client can then send the required stablecoin payment and receive the response instantly. This turns APIs into microservices with embedded pricing, enabling fine-grained monetization at the level of individual function calls. It’s a model that fits naturally with both AI workloads and human developers who want to pay only for what they use.Stablecoins like USDC are central to the success of x402 and agentic payments more broadly. Their key benefit is price stability, allowing developers and agents to transact in predictable units without worrying about crypto volatility. That’s critical for applications that operate with tight budgets or usage-based pricing.USDC also offers fast finality, especially on chains like Base, Solana and Ethereum layer 2s, where transfers can confirm in seconds with minimal fees. Its broad support across wallets, APIs and ecosystems makes it a practical choice for integration.

2025-05-15T09:02:00.000Z,"Coinbase’s x402: Crypto payments over HTTP for AI and APIs","What is HTTP 402, and why does it matter?              The web was not really built with payments in mind, especially not for autonomous agents or machines. But with the rise of AI and decentralized finance (DeFi), the need for seamless, native digital payments has never been more urgent. Coinbase x402 announced a new open protocol designed to let APIs, apps and AI agents pay instantly using stablecoins like USDC (USDC), all via the familiar HTTP protocol.This isn’t just a product update. X402 revives a long-forgotten piece of internet infrastructure and reimagines it for a future powered by agentic systems and crypto.HTTP status codes: A quick refresherUnderstanding HTTP status codes helps clarify how the web communicates behind the scenes. Here are some key ones to know:HTTP 200 — OK: Standard response for successful HTTP requests.HTTP 401 — Unauthorized: Indicates the request requires user authentication; typically used when credentials are missing or invalid.HTTP 403 — Forbidden: The server understood the request, but it refuses to authorize it (often due to lack of permissions or access control).HTTP 404 — Not found: Indicates that the requested resource could not be found.HTTP 402 — Payment required: Originally intended to support digital payments directly within the protocol but left as a “reserved for future use” status code due to the lack of global payment infrastructure at the time.HTTP 500 — Internal server error: A generic error message when the server encounters an unexpected condition.Although the creators of the web imagined a future where online services might request payments directly through the protocol, for decades, no one found a practical use for it. It sat dormant for over 25 years, with no widespread adoption or defined behavior.Today, HTTP 402 is finally coming to life, thanks to Coinbase’s x402 protocol. X402 turns HTTP 402 from a placeholder into a real mechanism. It allows websites, APIs and services to signal that a payment is required before granting access to digital goods or services.Unlike traditional payment systems, which rely on external redirects or complex integrations, x402 enables native, in-protocol payments using stablecoins directly over HTTP.But why do x402 and the activation of HTTP 402 matter?With machine-to-machine interactions, autonomous agents and AI-driven services on the rise, the internet needs a payment layer that is:InstantProgrammableInteroperableTrust-minimized.Activating HTTP 402 positions it as a key enabler for decentralized commerce, autonomous agents and crypto-native applications. It could become as foundational as HTTP 200 or 404 in a future where services charge micro-fees, stream value or sell access dynamically.                  Coinbase x402: A native payment layer for the web              Coinbase’s x402 is an open protocol that allows websites and APIs to request and receive payments in stablecoins directly over HTTP. It works by using the existing HTTP infrastructure and augmenting it with a lightweight payment layer. Here is the step-by-step process for machine-to-machine transactions using the x402 protocol:Client requests a paid resource: A client, such as an AI agent, app, or browser initiates a request to an x402-enabled server (e.g., an API, data set or digital service) that requires payment to access.The server responds with a 402 Payment Required: In response, the server returns an HTTP 402 status code, along with the payment details. This includes the amount to be paid, the supported token (such as USDC) and a payment payload or address to use.Client submits the payment: The client uses its crypto wallet to sign and submit the payment. This happens programmatically — no user interaction is needed, which enables fully automated or agentic payments. It resends the original request, this time including the encoded payment information in an X-PAYMENT HTTP header.The payment is verified and settled onchain: A payment facilitator service, such as Coinbase’s x402 Facilitator, checks the blockchain to verify that the payment has been made and confirmed.The server delivers the resource: Once the payment is validated, the server fulfills the request and returns the data or content. It also includes an X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE header confirming the success of the transaction.In x402, payments happen over standard HTTP using two custom headers: X-PAYMENT and X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE. These headers allow seamless, automated payments between apps, agents and servers — without changing how HTTP works. It’s a simple yet powerful way to enable web-native, machine-to-machine commerce using stablecoins.What makes x402 revolutionary is that it doesn’t require platforms, plugins or third-party integrations. It creates a native payment layer for the web itself, just like HTTPS added security or cookies enabled session management.Did you know? HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP, the foundational protocol used to transfer data on the web.                  What are agentic payments, and why are they important?              As AI systems become more advanced, the agentic era has begun. In this new paradigm, software agents, ranging from AI bots to autonomous scripts, are expected to act on behalf of users or even independently. AI agents will need to perform actions like accessing data, subscribing to services or renting compute power. And all of these tasks often require payments.This is where the concept of agentic payments comes in. These are payments made by agents, not humans — fast, automatic and often low-value. Think of a data-scraping AI paying a cent to read a scientific article or a supply chain bot paying fractions of a dollar for live port data.Traditional payment infrastructure wasn’t built for this kind of use case. It falls short because of the below reasons:Built for humans, not machines.Requires logins, manual steps and batch processing.High fees and slow settlement times make them unsuitable for high-frequency, low-value, autonomous transactions.Because of the limitations of traditional payment systems, agentic payments matter for several key reasons:They enable a machine-first economy, where software can transact just like humans.Make real-time AI decision-making possible by removing friction from access to paid services.Pave the way for composable services, where agents can chain together paid APIs and tools autonomously.As discussed, such payments require machine-readable protocols, instant settlement and predictable pricing, all of which x402 enables. It’s a vital step in building a transactional layer for a machine-first internet.                  x402 vs. traditional payment systems              Today’s online payment systems are deeply human-centric. Whether it’s signing up for a subscription, entering credit card information or passing Know Your Customer (KYC) checks, the current infrastructure assumes a person is at the center of every transaction.This design becomes a bottleneck when payments need to be made automatically, in real time and at scale. APIs that want to monetize often face hurdles like creating user accounts, handling fraud, managing disputes and integrating with centralized processors like Stripe or PayPal. These systems are slow, costly and often region-specific.X402 removes these barriers by allowing servers to ask for and receive payment directly through the protocol itself. There’s no need for logins, billing dashboards or delayed bank transfers. The value transfer is embedded into the fabric of the internet, optimized for agents and apps.The contrast between x402 and traditional payment infrastructure is stark. While x402 is protocol-first, built on crypto rails, systems like Visa, Stripe and PayPal are platform-first. X402 enables payments to settle in seconds using onchain transactions, while traditional rails typically settle over one to three business days.Moreover, x402 supports micropayments as small as fractions of a cent, making it viable for high-frequency, low-cost interactions — something that’s infeasible on credit card networks due to fees. It’s also global by design, requiring no currency conversions or regional banking relationships. Chargebacks, fraud risk and intermediary fees are virtually eliminated, thanks to the immutability of onchain transfers.Where traditional systems focus on human users with front-end interfaces, x402 enables machine-native, backend-to-backend monetization.Did you know? You can detect HTTP 402 responses using tools like Sitechecker Pro, which scans your site like a search bot and flags unusual status codes — including payment-related ones.                  Incumbents’ act: How Visa, Stripe and PayPal are exploring AI-powered payments              To be fair, incumbents aren’t ignoring this trend. Visa, Stripe and PayPal have all acted to be in line with the trend and incorporate appropriate changes in their approach.VisaVisa has announced initiatives to allow AI agents to make purchases on behalf of users by linking them to its global payments network. This move aims to facilitate autonomous AI assistants capable of performing shopping tasks, such as managing routine purchases, based on user-defined budgets and preferences.In partnership with Bridge, a stablecoin infrastructure provider, Visa is launching stablecoin-linked Visa cards across multiple countries in Latin America. This collaboration enables users to make everyday purchases using cryptocurrency tokens, with plans to expand to Europe, Africa and Asia in the coming months.StripeStripe has unveiled a new AI foundation model aimed at improving fraud detection and authorization rates. This model, trained on billions of transactions, has significantly increased the detection rate for fraudulent activities, such as card-testing attacks, enhancing the security of its payment systems.Stripe has introduced Stablecoin Financial Accounts, allowing businesses in over 100 countries to hold balances in dollar-backed stablecoins like USDC and USDB. These accounts support global payments and enable firms to manage stablecoins alongside traditional payment methods. PayPalPayPal is set to launch a rewards program offering users a 3.7% annual yield on holdings of its stablecoin, PayPal USD (PYUSD), in PayPal or Venmo wallets. This initiative aims to encourage the adoption and utilization of PYUSD for various transactions, including merchant payments and peer-to-peer transfers.PayPal has expanded its partnership with Coinbase to increase the adoption and utilization of PYUSD. This collaboration focuses on developing stablecoin-based payments and banking solutions, as well as exploring other use cases for PYUSD in DeFi and onchain platforms.Protocols vs. platforms: The distinct approachesWhile Visa, Stripe and PayPal are making significant strides in integrating AI and stablecoins into their services, these companies still operate within walled gardens. They offer services, not protocols. Their infrastructures are:Centralized: Governed by corporate policies and APIs.Permissioned: Access requires onboarding, KYC and platform approval.Closed ecosystems: Where user experience and interoperability are tightly controlled.In contrast, x402 is permissionless and open, allowing any developer to plug into it without needing a merchant account. And the distinction between centralized services and open protocols like x402 will play a crucial role in shaping the future landscape of digital payments, potentially leading to a more decentralized and agent-driven economy.                  What is x402’s monetization model?              One of the most practical use cases for x402 is API monetization. In today’s model, developers must create keys, handle access tiers, and enforce rate limits manually. With x402, APIs can simply respond to unauthenticated requests with a 402, indicating a cost, for example, $0.001 to access a data endpoint.A client can then send the required stablecoin payment and receive the response instantly. This turns APIs into microservices with embedded pricing, enabling fine-grained monetization at the level of individual function calls. It’s a model that fits naturally with both AI workloads and human developers who want to pay only for what they use.Stablecoins like USDC are central to the success of x402 and agentic payments more broadly. Their key benefit is price stability, allowing developers and agents to transact in predictable units without worrying about crypto volatility. That’s critical for applications that operate with tight budgets or usage-based pricing.USDC also offers fast finality, especially on chains like Base, Solana and Ethereum layer 2s, where transfers can confirm in seconds with minimal fees. Its broad support across wallets, APIs and ecosystems makes it a practical choice for integration. Other stablecoins like PYUSD or EURC may become relevant, but USDC’s dominance in DeFi and institutional finance gives it a clear head start.                  Challenges and opportunities for agentic payments              Agentic payments raise important questions around security, like how can bots manage private keys safely? There’s also the issue of abuse — will bad actors flood servers with fake payments or exploit pricing models? Regulatory concerns also loom.But the upside is enormous.

2025-05-15T09:00:00.000Z,"The value of virtual: Economies are powered by ownership of the intangible","Opinion by: Yat Siu, executive chairman and co-founder, Animoca BrandsA discussion on digital property rights, copyright, intellectual property, the open metaverse, AI and value without physical form.When I attend conferences and similar public events, someone almost always approaches me to ask how cryptographic tokens (fungible or non-fungible) can have value even though tokens are virtual and do not exist in the physical world. It's a surprisingly common question, especially one-on-one.Virtual objects like NFTs and cryptocurrencies are both digital and intangible; their existence is not based in the real (physical) world, and (unlike digital currencies) they generally do not have backing by real-world institutions. The ability to have value (specifically, monetary worth) is crucially important regarding the open metaverse, the decentralized internet of Web3 characterized by true digital ownership (see What IS the open metaverse?).I recently delved into the value of the virtual during an interview with CNBC, which may prove quite helpful to some readers. I'd like to discuss this topic in greater detail and with some historical context.When discussing whether something that doesn't exist in the real world can have real monetary worth, it is important to remember that intangible things have carried value for centuries; the key is ownership and the benefits associated with that ownership.How the ownership of ideas created the modern worldOne of the most important building blocks of modern industry and innovation-based economies was laid down more than three centuries ago in Great Britain with the long form title of \""An Act for the Encouragement of Learning by Vesting the Copies of Printed Books in the Authors or Purchasers of Such Copies, During the Times Therein Mentioned.\"" Also known as the Statute of Anne and the Copyright Act of 1709 (or 1710), this legislation provided the basis for modern copyright and intellectual property laws by establishing that the author of a particular work, not its publisher, was its rightful owner. The statute marked a pivotal moment in history by distinguishing between creators and distributors in much the same way that today we distinguish between creators (artists, writers, musicians, etc.) and the platforms that distribute their works (Netflix, Medium, Spotify, etc.).By granting creators exclusive rights to their works for a limited time, the Statute of Anne and subsequent acts established an economic framework for intellectual property under which creators could retain control and financial benefits over their works. At the same time, society gained access to those works through public libraries, book sales and similar means of distribution. The result was a veritable explosion of literature, science and philosophy that fueled the European Age of Enlightenment and the Scientific Revolution.This period in history saw the rise of literary giants such as Jane Austen, Victor Hugo and Charles Dickens, and intellectual titans including Voltaire, Rousseau, Kant, Hume, Mary Wollstonecraft and Adam Smith. In the sciences, the publicly available work of visionaries like Charles Darwin, Gregor Mendel and Marie Curie allowed us to radically advance our understanding of the physical world. The ability to own their ideas brought fame and financial independence to innovators, enabling them to challenge norms, push boundaries and distribute groundbreaking ideas. Copyright provided an economic incentive to create and share idea-based works, ensuring that contributions would endure and inspire future generations. Copyright was so powerful and impactful that other nations followed with their own measures, including the United States with its Copyright Act of 1790.Copyright and other forms of intellectual property protection have been accelerating innovation and powering economies for over three centuries. One of the most notable examples of this effect is China.China was a free haven for IP infringement. Pirated digital and physical goods were prevalent until the 1990s and early 2000s, when China began to strengthen its IP protection. This contributed to a meteoric rise in domestic Chinese innovation, and today, China is the world's leading generator of ideas in the form of scientific studies, patents, technology, content, etc.China's reforms to IP protection in the 1990s and early 2000s contributed to an explosion in the number of annual patent applications, considered a proxy indicator of innovation (image from Our World in Data)Owning the work of our mindsToday, it is widely acknowledged that intellectual property is subject to ownership just like material things, even though it is intangible and time-bound. We recognize that copyright, trademarks, patents and similar measures establish and protect ownership of the intangible.In a previous essay, I mentioned the work of the philosopher John Locke, describing the man as \""one of the OGs in the field of ownership and a major inspiration for both the European Enlightenment and the US Constitution.\""Loosely stated, Locke reasoned that a person has a natural right to own the labor of their \""body\"" and \""hands.\"" Copyright applied this Lockean view to the intangible products of the mind. Recent: Why crypto’s next breakthrough could start in the classroom — Animoca’s Yat SiuAs I noted in that essay, Locke's reasoning — that a person's labor generates property — provided a strong basis for \""ownership of intangibles including intellectual property, usage time, data, and the derivatives of data.\"" Intellectual property is fundamentally intangible: Scientific breakthroughs, literary works, musical compositions and various other creations of the mind emerge \""from thin air\"" and without fixed physical form. In capitalist economies, the protection of intellectual property plays a crucial role in supporting and incentivizing creators, making it possible for the work of our minds to enjoy commercial success, distribution and longevity. Without IP protection, entire industries (including technology, science and medicine) would be severely stunted by the lack of economic incentives to undertake research and development. It is no exaggeration to say that the Statute of Anne changed the world by launching a framework for creators to own and protect the work of their minds, which in turn made it possible to enhance and sustain innovation.The introduction of intellectual property protection laid the foundation for ownership over the intangible. It enabled our minds to create intangible capital assets, thus fuelling the economic engines of wealth generation. Just as importantly, copyright granted rights explicitly to creators, helping to decentralize the concentration of power away from big publishers.Ownership of the intangible represents such obvious and immense value to us at Animoca Brands that we made the advancement of digital property rights our core mission.The economic power of assets without physical existenceIt is well established in traditional business and finance that the intangible can have worth. Brand equity, intellectual property and goodwill are all considered valuable. The reams of intangible data you produce daily through your online activities are highly prized by companies and platforms that use it (and sometimes abuse it) to extract value from you.Consider that intangibles already dominate the global economy:The US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) estimated that in 2019, IP-intensive industries contributed 41% of US domestic economic activity, supporting 63 million jobs (44% of total US employment).The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) estimated that in 2023, intangible assets were valued at $62 trillion — multiples more than the total market cap of gold (about $17 trillion to $25 trillion).(On a related topic, the sheer economic power of IP makes recent suggestions by Jack Dorsey and Elon Musk that we should \""delete all IP law\"" all the more bizarre. Removing something that has successfully driven innovation, investment and development for more than 300 years hardly seems like the wisest course of action. I discussed this matter in a thread on X.)Blockchain technology is a game-changer because it can provide provable ownership, scarcity and economic opportunities for intangible assets in a decentralized manner at minimum cost, quickly and securely.In a non-blockchain framework, a public record of ownership for an asset is maintained by a trusted central authority, often a government agency. This presents significant challenges, including security, barriers to access, poor efficiency, high costs to owners, red tape and the poor cost-effectiveness of protecting items of relatively little worth.In blockchain-enabled frameworks, however, decentralized and immutable ledgers can greatly reduce waste, vulnerability and opportunity loss while providing and automating important record-keeping functions more efficiently and securely than centralized systems. But that's not all.The work of artificial mindsIP-based value creation is particularly critical in the context of the artificial intelligence revolution currently underway. IP protection recently gained attention through a viral trend of AI-generated images in the style of Hayo Miyazaki, the legendary founder of Studio Ghibli. This trend brought to the forefront some concerns about AIs that are trained using protected IP and the potential impact that easily generated imitations have on rightful IP owners.The film industry has been wrangling with this issue for years:\""OpenAI, a major US artificial intelligence company, and Google both wrote to the Office of Science and Technology Policy about an AI action plan this month, making the case that it would be beneficial for AI developers to be able to use copyrighted materials to train AI…\""SAG-AFTRA, the union that represents about 160,000 performers, wanted film and TV producers to obtain consent from actors to create and use their digital replicas. They also fought for actors to be compensated at their usual rate — even if a digital replica of them performs the role.\""CBS News, March 17, 2025These are thorny issues that will impact most industries, sooner or later. Can a society successfully legislate to protect the work of our minds from the highly efficient imitative assaults of artificial intelligence? Will AI regulation enhance industries or merely restrict innovation and competitiveness? There is a technological solution to some of the concerns around AI and copyright. Blockchain provides a secure and trustable type of framework for large-scale tracking, provenance, ownership and various other aspects of intellectual property that are currently being challenged by generative AIs. Even better, blockchain can also facilitate usage tracking and royalty payments related to ownership of individual assets, even for assets of very low value. In the AI-driven world of the near future, blockchain technology can be the basis for efficient mechanisms that provide fair rewards and accreditation to creators whose intellectual property fuels AI (a subject I addressed briefly in my TED Talk). Digital property rights: The next frontierWhen someone asks me how NFTs or cryptocurrencies can have real value despite being intangible, I usually ask them the same question about the work of their favorite musician, author or filmmaker. Most people have a fundamental appreciation for intellectual property rights in the context of \""traditional\"" industries because those industries have considerable experience managing ownership of the intangible. Intellectual property is recognized to have real value without physicality, and creators have the right to ownership over their intangible creations, empowering them to create capital \""out of thin air\"" through the work of their minds. This also applies to virtual objects (and, indeed, virtual objects often represent or are linked to intellectual property).Whether you own an idea, something you wrote, a digital currency, or an NFT, the key point is ownership and its associated benefits. Ownership of something (virtual or real) confers some degree of opportunity that would otherwise not be possible without that ownership.As the world embraces the digital frontier, the mission of Animoca Brands strikes me as more relevant than ever: to make available digital property rights for all, thereby helping to ensure that all creators can be rewarded fairly not only for their own creations but also for their relative contributions to the work of others (such as AIs, social networks, advertisers, remixers, etc.).The same principle of ownership over the intangible that helped fuel the Enlightenment, the Scientific Revolution, and the Information Age can now be extended to our digital lives in the decentralized open metaverse, where technological frameworks already enshrine provable ownership of the virtual, and where creating and accessing virtual assets is inherently democratic and easily available to all participants. A little over 315 years after the Statute of Anne began to pave the road that leads to the open metaverse, the confluence of technology and property rights is now poised to unlock nearly unimaginable creativity, economic empowerment and progress for billions of people. Opinion by: Yat Siu, executive chairman and co-founder, Animoca Brands.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

At the same time, society gained access to those works through public libraries, book sales and similar means of distribution. The result was a veritable explosion of literature, science and philosophy that fueled the European Age of Enlightenment and the Scientific Revolution.This period in history saw the rise of literary giants such as Jane Austen, Victor Hugo and Charles Dickens, and intellectual titans including Voltaire, Rousseau, Kant, Hume, Mary Wollstonecraft and Adam Smith. In the sciences, the publicly available work of visionaries like Charles Darwin, Gregor Mendel and Marie Curie allowed us to radically advance our understanding of the physical world. The ability to own their ideas brought fame and financial independence to innovators, enabling them to challenge norms, push boundaries and distribute groundbreaking ideas. Copyright provided an economic incentive to create and share idea-based works, ensuring that contributions would endure and inspire future generations. Copyright was so powerful and impactful that other nations followed with their own measures, including the United States with its Copyright Act of 1790.Copyright and other forms of intellectual property protection have been accelerating innovation and powering economies for over three centuries. One of the most notable examples of this effect is China.China was a free haven for IP infringement. Pirated digital and physical goods were prevalent until the 1990s and early 2000s, when China began to strengthen its IP protection. This contributed to a meteoric rise in domestic Chinese innovation, and today, China is the world's leading generator of ideas in the form of scientific studies, patents, technology, content, etc.China's reforms to IP protection in the 1990s and early 2000s contributed to an explosion in the number of annual patent applications, considered a proxy indicator of innovation (image from Our World in Data)Owning the work of our mindsToday, it is widely acknowledged that intellectual property is subject to ownership just like material things, even though it is intangible and time-bound. We recognize that copyright, trademarks, patents and similar measures establish and protect ownership of the intangible.In a previous essay, I mentioned the work of the philosopher John Locke, describing the man as \""one of the OGs in the field of ownership and a major inspiration for both the European Enlightenment and the US Constitution.\""Loosely stated, Locke reasoned that a person has a natural right to own the labor of their \""body\"" and \""hands.\"" Copyright applied this Lockean view to the intangible products of the mind. Recent: Why crypto’s next breakthrough could start in the classroom — Animoca’s Yat SiuAs I noted in that essay, Locke's reasoning — that a person's labor generates property — provided a strong basis for \""ownership of intangibles including intellectual property, usage time, data, and the derivatives of data.\"" Intellectual property is fundamentally intangible: Scientific breakthroughs, literary works, musical compositions and various other creations of the mind emerge \""from thin air\"" and without fixed physical form. In capitalist economies, the protection of intellectual property plays a crucial role in supporting and incentivizing creators, making it possible for the work of our minds to enjoy commercial success, distribution and longevity. Without IP protection, entire industries (including technology, science and medicine) would be severely stunted by the lack of economic incentives to undertake research and development. It is no exaggeration to say that the Statute of Anne changed the world by launching a framework for creators to own and protect the work of their minds, which in turn made it possible to enhance and sustain innovation.The introduction of intellectual property protection laid the foundation for ownership over the intangible. It enabled our minds to create intangible capital assets, thus fuelling the economic engines of wealth generation. Just as importantly, copyright granted rights explicitly to creators, helping to decentralize the concentration of power away from big publishers.Ownership of the intangible represents such obvious and immense value to us at Animoca Brands that we made the advancement of digital property rights our core mission.The economic power of assets without physical existenceIt is well established in traditional business and finance that the intangible can have worth. Brand equity, intellectual property and goodwill are all considered valuable. The reams of intangible data you produce daily through your online activities are highly prized by companies and platforms that use it (and sometimes abuse it) to extract value from you.Consider that intangibles already dominate the global economy:The US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) estimated that in 2019, IP-intensive industries contributed 41% of US domestic economic activity, supporting 63 million jobs (44% of total US employment).The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) estimated that in 2023, intangible assets were valued at $62 trillion — multiples more than the total market cap of gold (about $17 trillion to $25 trillion).(On a related topic, the sheer economic power of IP makes recent suggestions by Jack Dorsey and Elon Musk that we should \""delete all IP law\"" all the more bizarre. Removing something that has successfully driven innovation, investment and development for more than 300 years hardly seems like the wisest course of action. I discussed this matter in a thread on X.)Blockchain technology is a game-changer because it can provide provable ownership, scarcity and economic opportunities for intangible assets in a decentralized manner at minimum cost, quickly and securely.In a non-blockchain framework, a public record of ownership for an asset is maintained by a trusted central authority, often a government agency. This presents significant challenges, including security, barriers to access, poor efficiency, high costs to owners, red tape and the poor cost-effectiveness of protecting items of relatively little worth.In blockchain-enabled frameworks, however, decentralized and immutable ledgers can greatly reduce waste, vulnerability and opportunity loss while providing and automating important record-keeping functions more efficiently and securely than centralized systems. But that's not all.The work of artificial mindsIP-based value creation is particularly critical in the context of the artificial intelligence revolution currently underway. IP protection recently gained attention through a viral trend of AI-generated images in the style of Hayo Miyazaki, the legendary founder of Studio Ghibli. This trend brought to the forefront some concerns about AIs that are trained using protected IP and the potential impact that easily generated imitations have on rightful IP owners.The film industry has been wrangling with this issue for years:\""OpenAI, a major US artificial intelligence company, and Google both wrote to the Office of Science and Technology Policy about an AI action plan this month, making the case that it would be beneficial for AI developers to be able to use copyrighted materials to train AI…\""SAG-AFTRA, the union that represents about 160,000 performers, wanted film and TV producers to obtain consent from actors to create and use their digital replicas. They also fought for actors to be compensated at their usual rate — even if a digital replica of them performs the role.\""CBS News, March 17, 2025These are thorny issues that will impact most industries, sooner or later. Can a society successfully legislate to protect the work of our minds from the highly efficient imitative assaults of artificial intelligence? Will AI regulation enhance industries or merely restrict innovation and competitiveness? There is a technological solution to some of the concerns around AI and copyright. Blockchain provides a secure and trustable type of framework for large-scale tracking, provenance, ownership and various other aspects of intellectual property that are currently being challenged by generative AIs. Even better, blockchain can also facilitate usage tracking and royalty payments related to ownership of individual assets, even for assets of very low value. In the AI-driven world of the near future, blockchain technology can be the basis for efficient mechanisms that provide fair rewards and accreditation to creators whose intellectual property fuels AI (a subject I addressed briefly in my TED Talk). Digital property rights: The next frontierWhen someone asks me how NFTs or cryptocurrencies can have real value despite being intangible, I usually ask them the same question about the work of their favorite musician, author or filmmaker. Most people have a fundamental appreciation for intellectual property rights in the context of \""traditional\"" industries because those industries have considerable experience managing ownership of the intangible. Intellectual property is recognized to have real value without physicality, and creators have the right to ownership over their intangible creations, empowering them to create capital \""out of thin air\"" through the work of their minds. This also applies to virtual objects (and, indeed, virtual objects often represent or are linked to intellectual property).Whether you own an idea, something you wrote, a digital currency, or an NFT, the key point is ownership and its associated benefits. Ownership of something (virtual or real) confers some degree of opportunity that would otherwise not be possible without that ownership.As the world embraces the digital frontier, the mission of Animoca Brands strikes me as more relevant than ever: to make available digital property rights for all, thereby helping to ensure that all creators can be rewarded fairly not only for their own creations but also for their relative contributions to the work of others (such as AIs, social networks, advertisers, remixers, etc.).The same principle of ownership over the intangible that helped fuel the Enlightenment, the Scientific Revolution, and the Information Age can now be extended to our digital lives in the decentralized open metaverse, where technological frameworks already enshrine provable ownership of the virtual, and where creating and accessing virtual assets is inherently democratic and easily available to all participants. A little over 315 years after the Statute of Anne began to pave the road that leads to the open metaverse, the confluence of technology and property rights is now poised to unlock nearly unimaginable creativity, economic empowerment and progress for billions of people. Opinion by: Yat Siu, executive chairman and co-founder, Animoca Brands.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.
