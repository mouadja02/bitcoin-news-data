2025-05-16T13:29:56.000Z,"51% attack on Ethereum more difficult than on Bitcoin — Justin Drake","Ethereum Merge architect Justin Drake told Cointelegraph that he believes it would be cheaper to launch a 51% attack on Bitcoin than on Ethereum.Drake said it would be “much cheaper to 51% attack Bitcoin” and that it would cost “on the order of $10 billion.”Drake led work on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake (PoS) implementation and was a principal architect in the Merge (the full PoS transition event). His remarks echo a May 14 X post by Grant Hummer, the co-founder of Ethereum-focused marketing and product company Etherealize. In the post, Hummer said that Bitcoin “is completely screwed because of its security budget.”Hummer claimed it would cost $8 billion to run a successful 51% attack, and he expects a successful attack to be “virtually certain” when the cost slips to $2 billion. A 51% attack occurs when a single entity or group controls over 50% of a blockchain network’s mining or staking power, gaining power over the network. Hummer added:“This will become blindingly obvious over the next decade. ETH is the only truly decentralized crypto-asset that can become the internet's [store of value].“Related: Coin Metrics research shows BTC and ETH are immune to 51% attacksEthereum attack would cost much moreDrake explained that “to have 100% control of the chain, you need 50% + 1 of stake.” He said that it would be extremely difficult and expensive, but far from impossible:“A rich nation state can probably pull it off.“At the time of writing, there was 34,168,987 staked Ether (ETH) worth nearly $89.6 billion. Consequently, half of all ETH has a current value of almost $44.8 billion.Staked Ether chart. Source: BeaconCha.inStill, a much higher investment would likely be needed. Ether has a current market cap of $316 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $25 billion (just over 8% of the market cap).The ETH needed for an attack is worth nearly 14.2% of the market cap and 180% of the 24-hour trading volume. An undertaking of that size would likely cause a significant ETH price appreciation, further increasing the cost of the attack.Related: Big miners pose a growing existential threat to BitcoinEthereum’s last line of defenseMatan Sitbon, the founder and CEO of blockchain interoperability developer Lightblocks, told Cointelegraph that Ethereum has an additional feature to defend against such attacks.“Ethereum’s ultimate security lies not solely in cryptography or protocol rules, but in the community’s powerful social and economic coordination mechanisms,“ he said.Drake also highlighted another advantage that he believes Ethereum has over Bitcoin. He explained that “if there is a 51% attack, the social layer can identify the attacker and socially slash it.” “This is a superpower of PoS that is not available with PoW,“ he added.Drake’s statement refers to the social layer, meaning the network’s human supermajority, which decides which software to run. Bitcoin’s simpler proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism has a smaller attack surface and longer reliability track record, but it lacks this feature.Pavel Yashin, Researcher at P2P.org, told Cointelegraph that “if the centralization is detected,” the community could resolve it with a new fork. The old token would end up being delisted, and the compromised chain would fall into irrelevancy.Hassan Khan, CEO at Bitcoin liquidity protocol Ordeez, told Cointelegraph that “the debate around the feasibility of a 51% attack remains open-ended — largely because while theoretically possible, in practice the barriers are extremely high.”He said that for Bitcoin, the necessary amount of computing power and energy “makes a sustained attack highly improbable,” while for Ethereum, “PoS introduces additional economic and governance deterrents.”Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-proponent-claims-bitcoin-is-screwed-a-51-attack-likely?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

2025-05-16T11:35:00.000Z,"AI vibe coding: what it is, why it’s risky, and how to stay safe","What is AI vibe coding?              AI vibe coding is a novel approach to software development that generates advanced, executable code based on well-crafted natural language user prompts. Yet another innovation fueled by artificial intelligence capabilities, AI vibe coding is proving to be a game-changer, especially for non-technical enthusiasts who can now experiment with software development and contribute to the ever-expanding technology ecosystem.At a fundamental level, AI vibe coding uses advanced machine learning algorithms to interpret natural language instructions and generate corresponding code in the desired software language. Users can input their requirements in plain language, such as “create a crypto website with a blog section and user login functionality,” and AI tools will generate the appropriate body of code needed to realize the project. This contrasts with traditional software development practices, which require the user to be skilled in programming languages and incorporate formal reviews along the journey. Notably, Charlie Shrem, an early Bitcoin pioneer, is bringing back the Bitcoin faucet — a site where people earn small amounts of Bitcoin by solving CAPTCHAs. His new site, 21million.com, is inspired by a 2010 version that helped spread Bitcoin in its early days. Right now, the site isn’t fully working and has no Bitcoin (BTC) to claim, but Shrem says it’s meant to help new users get started, with no hidden catch. He’s building it using AI tools, calling it “vibe coding.” Shrem, who once ran a major Bitcoin exchange, hopes this project will spark fresh interest in Bitcoin.While AI vibe coding can lead to faster software development results, there is a risk that the output generated from a vibe coding approach may not be adequately reviewed and signed off, which is where traditional coding practices continue to offer safeguards.Did you know? The term “vibe coding” was popularized by OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy, who described it as a way to “fully give in to the vibes,” effectively embracing AI-generated code without manually tweaking it.                  Key features of AI vibe coding              Unlike traditional coding, AI vibe coding requires no formal software development qualifications for users to get started. All you need to vibe code is an idea, with the ability to write it clearly using natural language prompts.Fundamentally, AI vibe coding is characterized by the following features:Natural language processing (NLP): AI vibe coding relies heavily on NLP to understand and process user instructions. Machine learning: As with all practical applications of AI, machine learning models trained on vast amounts of coding data are used to generate executable code based on user prompts.Real-time feedback: Users can receive and provide immediate feedback on the output, allowing for efficient code iteration and refinement.Accessibility: Vibe coding democratizes software development, enabling individuals without formal coding training to create functional applications. It lowers or eliminates the entry barriers into programming, empowering more users to participate in technology design and foster innovation from diverse perspectives.                  Why is AI vibe coding considered risky?              Despite its obvious benefits, AI vibe coding carries many risks that users must be aware of and mitigate as required. These risks range from security concerns to ethical and legal implications. Understanding the risks associated with AI vibe coding can help users alleviate potential issues and legal implications. Here’s a post by Matt Palmer outlining common safeguards to be considered for AI vibe coding. Some of the common risks associated with AI vibe coding are:Security concerns: AI-generated code might be susceptible to vulnerabilities if the underlying algorithms fail to account for security best practices. After all, AI learns from somewhere else! Therefore, inexperienced users might inadvertently create applications prone to cyberattacks, exposing sensitive data and risking user trust. This is particularly concerning when building applications that handle personal or financial information, as even a minor security flaw can have significant repercussions.Code quality: While AI tools can generate functional code, the quality and reliability of this code may vary, and will certainly not cater to all nuances commonly found in a real-world scenario. Similarly, AI’s understanding of user requirements might not always align perfectly with the intended functionality, leading to bugs and inefficiencies. Furthermore, the AI might not always follow the best coding practices, resulting in code that is difficult to maintain and scale. This can be especially problematic in large-scale projects where code quality is paramount.Ethical concerns: AI vibe coding can raise ethical and legal questions, especially concerning intellectual property. There might be ambiguity in ownership and copyright of AI-generated code, posing challenges for developers and users. Additionally, using AI in coding can lead to ethical concerns about job displacement and the devaluation of human expertise. It's crucial for developers and organizations to navigate these issues thoughtfully and responsibly, especially when relying on vibe coding practices for large-scale project development.Over-reliance on AI: As AI vibe coding becomes more prevalent, there is a risk of developers becoming overly reliant on AI tools, potentially diminishing their traditional coding skills and understanding. This reliance on AI can lead to a lack of deep technical knowledge, making it difficult for developers to troubleshoot issues or innovate independently. Continuous learning and skill enhancement are essential to maintain a balanced approach to software development.Explainability: While AI vibe coders may eventually even get the job done with vibe coding, they may not always have the skills required to review, debug, or refactor their code due to the lack of traditional software development skillsets, impacting the explainability and ultimately, reliability of code.Did you know? A major risk of AI vibe coding is the emergence of “slopsquatting,” a new type of supply chain attack where AI-generated code suggests non-existent package names, which attackers can exploit by creating malicious versions — talk about innovating to wreak havoc!                  How to vibe code safely              To mitigate the risks associated with AI vibe coding, users should adopt certain best practices. These practices can help ensure the AI-generated code is secure, reliable and ethically sound.Best practices to vibe code safely include:Learning best practices: Even though AI vibe coding simplifies the development process, users should still familiarize themselves with basic coding principles. This knowledge will help in understanding the AI-generated code and making necessary adjustments. It also enables users to identify potential issues and apply best practices, ensuring the code is robust and maintainable.Implementing security measures: It is crucial to ensure that the AI-generated code adheres to security best practices. As seen in a popular example on X, where a non-technical founder publicly shared his journey to building a web-based application exclusively with vibe coding, a lack of security considerations resulted in cyber threat actors attacking the application, resulting in it being taken down.Users should incorporate security checks and validations to safeguard their applications against potential threats. Regularly updating and patching the code, conducting security audits and following industry standards can help mitigate security risks.Regular audits and reviews: Conducting regular code reviews can help identify vulnerabilities and improve the overall quality of AI-generated code. Collaborating with experienced developers for feedback and insights is highly beneficial. Peer reviews and collaborative coding sessions can provide valuable perspectives and enhance code quality.Understanding ethical and legal implications: Users should know the ethical and legal ramifications of using AI-generated code. Consulting with legal experts on intellectual property and copyright issues can prevent future complications. Additionally, being informed of ethical guidelines and industry standards can help developers navigate the evolving landscape of AI in coding.                  How can blockchain support AI vibe coding?              Blockchain technology has the potential to enhance security, transparency and collaboration in AI vibe coding, complementing existing platforms like GitHub. Here’s how it can help:Securing AI-generated code: Blockchain’s decentralized and tamper-resistant design can help verify the integrity of AI-generated code. By recording hashes or proofs of code versions onchain (alongside repositories like GitHub), developers can detect unauthorized changes and maintain a secure, auditable history.Maintaining transparency: While platforms like GitHub track code changes, blockchain can provide an additional transparent, immutable log of modifications and interactions. This makes it easier to trace code evolution and verify its origins, improving accountability in collaborative AI projects.Enhancing collaboration: Blockchain-based systems can offer secure, trustless environments for developers to exchange code, feedback and ideas, complementing centralized platforms like GitHub. Though still emerging, these decentralized approaches have the potential to further strengthen collaboration in AI development.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/ai-vibe-coding-what-it-is-why-its-risky-and-how-to-stay-safe?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

He said moving even 10% of that market onchain could significantly boost DeFi’s growth.“You basically more than quadruple TVL in all of DeFi,” he said, underscoring how the industry is still in its early stages. Consensus chairman Michael Lau (left) with Animoca Brands chairman Yat Siu (right) at the Consensus mainstage in Toronto, Canada. Source: CointelegraphWeb3-based education tools to drive crypto adoptionSiu said that Web3-based financial tools for the education sector could drive mass crypto adoption, especially among the young and unbanked.“The first unbanked are the kids,” he said. “If a student receives a loan onchain and pays it back onchain — which is regulated, better, faster, cheaper — they become onboarded for crypto for life.” Siu compared the situation to how PayPal and Venmo scaled by offering essential services to underserved users. He suggested that student loans could serve as crypto’s entry into the mainstream.The executive also highlighted Animoca Brands’ recent investment in Pencil Finance, a startup providing crypto-native student loans. Siu said the project operates in the Philippines and Indonesia, and plans to expand to the US. On April 30, Pencil Finance announced a $10 million student loan financing initiative to provide cheaper, blockchain-backed loans. Siu previously said in an interview that the industry needs these “positive-sum use cases” that everyone understands. He said students would be more pro-crypto if they had more opportunities through crypto loans. Related: NFT founder stole millions from Bitcoin project, investors allegeEducation is a natural Web3 use caseSiu also told the Consensus audience that education is a natural use case for Web3. He highlighted YouTube and TikTok, platforms that are often dismissed as entertainment applications. Siu said these social media apps are now the largest informal learning platforms in the world. He said everything is tied to education and that Web3 could do something similar. “Education is actually fundamental, something we do all the time,” Siu said. He suggested that by integrating financial infrastructure into educational experiences, Web3 could turn learning communities and reputational networks into capital assets, forming the basis of a new, decentralized financial ecosystem.Magazine: Binance Wallet ‘killing’ MetaMask and airdrops, Chinese RWA tokens: Asia Express",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/defi-student-loans-onchain-education-wave?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

Bitcoin (BTC) has a “decent chance” of hitting $250,000 or more in 2025 as attention turns to gold copycat moves.In his latest analysis, X analytics account Apsk32 argued that the four-year BTC price cycle should provide unprecedented highs this year.Bitcoin “power curve” delivers $200,000+ targetBitcoin following gold to new all-time highs is a popular theory among bulls. Historically, BTC/USD follows XAU/USD higher with a delay of several months.For Apsk32, the implications are considerable this time around; with gold hitting a record $3,500 per ounce, the future for BTC price action is bright.“Bitcoin’s position relative to gold has improved considerably since April,” he told X followers alongside his dedicated “power curve” tool. “This is the indicator that gives me hope for higher than expected returns later this year.”Bitcoin power curve data. Source: Apsk32/XThe power curve concept involves measuring Bitcoin price in gold ounces to avoid the inflationary nature of the US dollar.“Here, I’m measuring the value of the Bitcoin network (market cap) in gold ounces and fitting that value to a power curve,” Apsk32 explained in a dedicated X post in March.Among the results is a potential bull market top target that contextualizes the old 2017 top of $20,000.“If Bitcoin’s network value measured in gold continues to follow a power curve, and gold holds its current value, and Bitcoin’s price returns to ‘five years ahead of support,’ we could hit Josh’s $444K this year,” it added.This week, Apsk32 suggested that a more “reasonable” target for 2025 would be up to $220,000.“If we start getting above $250k, that’s what I would consider ‘higher than expected,’” he responded when asked about the outlook.“I do think there's a decent chance we get there, it's just not the most likely outcome.”Bitcoin power curve chart. Source: Apsk32/XHalf gold’s future market cap means $1 million BTCContinuing the gold theme, Bitcoin analyst Sam Callahan considered data showing how high BTC/USD could go if it were to capture varying portions of gold’s market cap.Related: Bitcoin to $1M by 2028 as Hayes tells Europe to’ get your money out’This could come about thanks to a shift toward “digital gold,” something widely anticipated to gain momentum in the coming years.“If gold hits $5,000/oz by 2030 and Bitcoin captures 50% of its market cap, that puts BTC at $924K,” Callahan noted, alongside the data from the latest report by In Gold We Trust, released this week. Gold/Bitcoin matrix (screenshot).

2025-05-16T07:30:00.000Z,"Tether AI: What it is and why it matters for crypto and AI","What is Tether AI?              Tether AI is an open-source, decentralized artificial intelligence (AI) platform launched by Tether, the company behind the Tether USDt (USDT) stablecoin. Unlike traditional AI services that depend on centralized servers and require application programming interface (API) keys, Tether AI runs on a distributed peer-to-peer (P2P) network, offering enhanced privacy, autonomy and resilience. Designed to be modular and composable, Tether AI can operate on any hardware, whether mobile, desktop or edge devices, without centralized control or a single point of failure. A core innovation of Tether AI is its integration with cryptocurrency infrastructure. It natively supports Bitcoin (BTC) and USDt payments using Tether’s Wallet Development Kit (WDK), enabling seamless onchain transactions. This makes Tether AI one of the first AI platforms to offer direct crypto payment functionality at the protocol level.According to Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether AI, it is a “fully open-source AI runtime, capable of adapting and evolving on any hardware and device, no API keys, no central point of failure, fully modular and composable, WDK-infused to enable USDT and Bitcoin payments.”Ardoino said Tether AI's primary objective is to create the “ideal technological foundation” for realizing the AI vision of Isaac Asimov, the celebrated science fiction author behind I, Robot and The Robot Series. In a separate post on X (written in Italian), Ardoino further asserted, “AI will, in the coming decades, become part of the very fabric of the universe.”                  How Tether AI personalizes infinite intelligence              Tether AI is built around the AI runtime structure of “personal infinite intelligence,” which envisions customizable AI agents tailored to individual user needs and device capabilities. Developers can leverage Tether’s open-source WDK, launched in November 2024, to create mobile, desktop and web wallets with complete self-custodial control.The platform enables native payments in USDt and Bitcoin to be processed directly over a peer-to-peer network, eliminating reliance on centralized payment processors. It emphasizes user ownership, ensuring individuals control their assets without intermediaries. This decentralization-first model supports Tether’s mission of making AI accessible and censorship-resistant. Ardoino has been critical of the AI industry’s dependence on centralized APIs and cloud platforms; Tether AI aligns with this mission.The project will facilitate integrating native USDt and Bitcoin payments into autonomous systems and software agents. The objective is to create a decentralized, censorship-resistant foundation for AI tools.Did you know? Tether AI CEO Paolo Ardoino favors locally executable AI models that can run directly on the user’s device, be it a smartphone or laptop, eliminating the need for third-party servers. This ensures that data stays local and allows for offline use.                  How Tether AI brings decentralized intelligence to Keet and Pear              Tether AI is expected to integrate with Tether’s existing peer-to-peer ecosystem, including Keet, a decentralized messaging app, and Pear, a framework for building P2P applications. Initially unveiled in December 2024, the platform is slated for launch in 2025, marking Tether’s strategic entry into decentralized AI with embedded crypto functionality.This initiative is part of a broader corporate shift announced in April 2024, which had Tether restructuring its operations to create dedicated units for AI and peer-to-peer technologies, such as Tether Data. Tether is actively developing Tether AI and a suite of AI-powered applications. These include a real-time AI translation tool for international communication, a voice assistant for hands-free platform and application control, and a Bitcoin wallet assistant to streamline transaction management. Tether, under Ardoino, views AI as a cornerstone of technological advancement.Tether’s AI expansion follows the company reporting $1 billion in operating profit for Q1 2025, mainly from US Treasury returns. With $149.3 billion in total assets and $5.6 billion in excess reserves, Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin sector. Its move into AI underscores a commitment to innovation, positioning the firm at the forefront of crypto and next-generation intelligent technologiesDid you know? Decentralized intelligence allows AI models to run across a network of devices instead of a single centralized server. This approach reduces the risk of data breaches, avoids single points of failure and gives users greater control over their data.                  Key features of Tether’s WDK              Tether’s WDK, launched in November 2024, is an open-source framework designed to simplify the creation of self-custodial wallets across mobile, desktop and web platforms. The WDK empowers developers to build crypto wallets that support secure, peer-to-peer transactions without relying on centralized infrastructure.Key features of the WDK include:Modularity: WDK has modules that enable developers to customize wallet functionalities based on specific use cases, including payments, storage or integration with decentralized applications (DApps). Pre-built components: WDK includes pre-built components for encryption, transaction management, key recovery and cross-platform compatibility, making it highly adaptable for beginners and advanced developers.User sovereignty: All wallets built using WDK enable full self-custody, meaning users retain exclusive control over their private keys and funds. Integration with other P2P technologies: WDK supports seamless integration with Tether's other peer-to-peer technologies, including Keet and Pear.In the context of Tether AI, WDK will play a critical role in embedding native crypto payments into decentralized AI applications, allowing automated agents and users to transact onchain with minimal friction. By bridging wallet development with AI and Web3 infrastructure, WDK advances Tether’s vision of a decentralized digital economy.Did you know? In collaborative AI development, models are trained and improved by a global community without central ownership. This open-source approach can lead to fairer, more inclusive AI systems that are free from the biases or profit motives of centralized tech giants.                  Implications of merging AI with blockchain are just beginning              Tether AI signals a transformative shift in how AI can be developed, deployed and monetized in a decentralized ecosystem. Blending AI capabilities with blockchain infrastructure and native crypto payments has enabled Tether to create applications that are not only intelligent but also financially autonomous and resistant to centralized control. Tether AI will facilitate direct execution payments on peer-to-peer networks without any role for intermediaries. For developers, Tether AI opens up new avenues to build adaptive AI systems that run on any device, support real-time crypto payments and prioritize user sovereignty. For users, it means greater control over personal data, enhanced privacy and transparent interaction with AI services.This paradigm challenges the dominance of cloud-based AI monopolies, offering an open-source alternative that can evolve with community input. In the long term, Tether AI could influence sectors such as decentralized finance (DeFi), content moderation, Web3 gaming and autonomous economic agents. It positions AI not as a corporate product, but as a public utility — transparent, modular and composable — while integrated with crypto. By merging AI with the trustless architecture of blockchain, Tether is pioneering a new class of decentralized digital infrastructure.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/tether-ai-what-it-is-and-why-it-matters-for-crypto-and-ai?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

It’s moving from noise to signal,” she said.“Teams are building, and capital continues to flow into the space. What we might be seeing is a healthier ecosystem — one driven less by speculative play-to-earn mechanics and more by users who have a genuine interest in gameplay, asset ownership and community.”April’s blockchain gaming investment activity also dropped 69% from March, reaching $21 million.Weaker projects die off, funds shift to buildersGherghelas said part of the drop is because investor and user interest is increasingly shifting toward real-world assets and artificial intelligence.Another factor is the macroeconomic landscape, with ongoing market uncertainty weighing on investor sentiment, making capital harder to secure for startups.Gherghelas said weaker projects “are falling away,” and funds are flowing into other projects that “are quietly laying the groundwork for the next generation of blockchain games.”Blockchain gaming funding has seen a sharp drop since last year. Source: DappRadar“Investors are now optimizing for sustainable models, player engagement, and actual retention, not just token hype,” she added. “This shows that the market’s clearly in reset mode.”Gherghelas noted that “66% of all blockchain game funding in 2025 so far has gone to infrastructure,” signaling a more mature market.Related: Crypto gaming has mixed Q1 as deals jump, investment totals dip: DappRadarMainstream gaming companies are also still experimenting with blockchain-powered games, with Gherghelas pointing to Ubisoft's partnership with Immutable, and Sega adding non-fungible tokens and play-to-earn mechanics to its game, KAI: Battle of Three Kingdoms, as prime examples.“April 2025 wasn’t a record-breaking month for blockchain gaming, and that’s okay.

Source: L2beatFraud proofs assume transactions are invalid until proven valid, while validity proofs assume transactions are valid only if proven valid with cryptographic evidence.“Our goal is for the training wheels to come off completely and to reach Stage 2 decentralization on Ethereum, and simultaneously steam forward with our work on Bitcoin too,” said Eli Ben-Sasson, co-founder and CEO of StarkWare, the developer behind Starknet. “Stage 2” decentralization is the point where the network will be fully autonomous and community-governed. Only three small layer-2 scaling platforms have reached this stage, according to L2beat. Related: Vitalik Buterin says rollups must prove security before decentralizingButerin introduced the concept of “training wheels” or three stages for Ethereum scaling rollup projects at various phases of development in 2022.Base leads layer-2 ecosystemThe Coinbase layer-2 network Base is the leader of the sector in terms of value locked, with $14.7 billion, giving it a market share of 33%.

Source: YouTubeOriginally, a four-member Tinian delegation to the Marianas legislature had unanimously passed the bill to Governor Palacios on March 12.It may put the Tinian government in the lead to be the first US public entity to issue a stablecoin, which it must do before July if it’s to beat the state of Wyoming government, which is aiming to issue a stablecoin by then.Tinian has just over 2,000 residents and a largely tourism-based economy. Its local government, the Municipality of Tinian and Aguiguan, is one of four municipalities in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, a US territory in the Pacific Ocean north of Guam.Governor Palacios said in a letter that he vetoed the bill as it “presents several legal issues and may be unconstitutional,” would regulate an activity that could not “be clearly restricted” to Tinian and that it lacked needed enforcement measures to counter illegal gambling.The stablecoin is called the Marianas US Dollar (MUSD) and will be backed by cash and US Treasury bills held in reserve by the Tinian Municipal Treasury, according to statements shared with Cointelegraph in March.The Tinian government chose local tech services firm Marianas Rai Corporation as the exclusive infrastructure provider for MUSD, which will be launched on the eCash blockchain, a network that rebranded from Bitcoin Cash ABC in 2021 and is a fork of Bitcoin Cash, a blockchain forked from Bitcoin.A Marianas Rai Corp. spokesperson did not comment beyond telling Cointelegraph the company would announce more on MUSD on May 19.“Bitter pill to swallow”Before the vote, House lawmakers heard from the public and discussed overturning Governor Palacios’ veto before they voted it through, with independent House floor leader Marissa Flores airing concerns over the bill.Marianas Rai Corp. co-founder and technology chief Vin Armani had urged lawmakers to undo the veto, saying the bill would “attract billions of dollars of investment and tax revenue” from the crypto industry without the government having to pitch in.Clyde Norita, a Marianas Rai Corp. director and local legal cannabis mogul, told the House that the local economy was “dying out” and the bill would allow business in the region “without affecting our culture, without affecting our environment, without affecting our immigration status.”Representative Flores, who voted against the override, said, \""Every time we talk about casinos, there’s always some kind of bitter pill to swallow.”Related: Stablecoin regulation 'next catalyst' for crypto industry — Aptos head “It is true, we are in dire need of money, but what I don’t like is when we are desperate, and we are now forced to make a decision because we are desperate once again,” she added. “Every time we’re desperate, it always seems that we come back to casinos.”“I don’t like to be pushed to a corner to make a decision based on fear,” Flores said.Others were more supportive of the measure, with Republican Representative Patrick San Nicolas, a Tinian delegation member who initially voted on the bill, saying it would help pull the region out of “a deep economic crisis.”“We need this legislation to unlock our potential,” he added. “This bill does not depend on tourists or federal subsidies — it builds a digital industry generating revenue from a licensed jurisdiction.”Legal Panel: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/northern-marianas-house-overrides-veto-passes-stablecoin-bill?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

By 2019, it had dropped to just over $370 million and has never returned to its previous highs.NFTs also had their day, and saw a massive surge of popularity in 2020 and continued to grow until hitting a peak in 2022, with trading volumes reaching $57.2 billion and the market’s sales count hitting 121.7 million. The market has since cooled as well. “I think the fact that we’re still healthy without one of those to drive it is a really, really good sign,” Guthrie said.Market more mature this cycle, despite memecoin hype The overall crypto market capitalization hit a new all-time high of $3.71 trillion on Dec. 9 last year, with many cryptocurrencies also registering significant price gains, according to CoinMarketCap. During this cycle, there has also been a growing trend of companies, such as video game retailer GameStop Corporation, and countries, Ukraine possibly being one of the latest, adopting crypto for treasuries and reserves.“I think this is starting to feel like a more mature market that is really settling on its use case, its value prop,” Guthrie said.“I know there has been a bit of memecoin stuff, particularly around Solana, but it doesn’t seem anywhere near as prevalent as the previous kind of hype has been,” he added. Related: Bitcoin experiencing ‘shakeout,’ not end of 4-year cycle: AnalystsThere was a surge in memecoin activity after the launch of US President Donald Trump’s memecoin on Jan. 18, when Pump.fun usage recorded an all-time high of $3.3 billion in weekly trading volume. However, enthusiasm for memecoins dropped after a series of bad launches and rug pulls, killed off investor interest, such as the Libra (LIBRA) rug. Ultimately, Guthrie thinks there is still a “lot of innovation to do,” and it’s still “very early days,” but the market has matured and has greater sustainability compared to previous cycles. Additional reporting by Sam Bourgi.Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-lacks-frothy-use-case-good-sign-wisdomtree?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

The DOJ said several defendants have been arrested, while two others are believed to be living in Dubai.Many of the suspects, with aliases like “Goth Ferrrari” and “The Accountant,” come from California, mostly aged between 18 and 22. The group allegedly began operating in October 2023, evolving from friends while playing online games to what the DOJ describes as participating in a “cyber-enabled racketeering conspiracy.”Hacking, burglarizing and launderingThe DOJ said group members were tasked with everything from hacking databases, cold calling crypto holders to conduct social engineering attacks to even burglarizing houses to steal crypto hardware wallets.Others were involved in laundering the stolen proceeds, which the DOJ claimed amounted to $263 million. Over $230 million resulted from a single instance on Aug. 18, 2024, when Lam fraudulently obtained over 4,100 Bitcoin (BTC) from a victim.Related: Crypto exchange CEO’s daughter fights off brazen kidnappers in ParisThe DOJ said Lam also hacked into another victim’s iCloud account to watch their movements, while defendant Marlon Ferro would break into their house to steal crypto hardware wallets.Virtual private networks, crypto mixer protocols and exchanges using “peel chains” were used to make it harder to trace the illicit activity, the DOJ said.

I understand they can’t possibly take all these service calls but there should be a way to do it, maybe some sort of social way to call out a particular account.” At least one user replied in the comments saying the fraudsters had targeted them, while Web3 OG Dovey Wan said she had also been deepfaked in a similar scam. Source: Dovey WanFBI and crypto founder says vigilance is key to avoid scams Nailwal suggests the best way to avoid being duped by these types of scams is to never install anything during an online interaction initiated by another person and to keep a separate device specifically for accessing crypto wallets. Related: AI deepfake attacks will extend beyond videos and audio — Security firmsMeanwhile, the FBI says to verify the identity of anyone who contacts you, examine all sender addresses for mistakes or inconsistencies, and check all images and videos for distorted hands, feet or unrealistic facial features. At the same time, the agency recommends never sharing sensitive information with someone you have never met, clicking links from people you don’t know, and setting up two-factor or multifactor authentication. Magazine: Deepfake AI ‘gang’ drains $11M OKX account, Zipmex zapped by SEC: Asia Express",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-officials-targeted-deepfake-phishing-attacks-fbi?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

Sharing the stage with Asher Genoot, the CEO of Bitcoin (BTC) mining company Hut 8, Trump said Bitcoin adoption has been incredible. “I'm traveling. I'm on a plane. Everybody in the world is trying to hoard Bitcoin right now. Everybody. I hear it from sovereign wealth funds. I hear it from the wealthiest families. I hear from the biggest companies.”Asher Genoot and Eric Trump at Consensus 2025.

On May 12, the companies announced American Bitcoin would merge with Gryphon Digital Mining in a stock-for-stock transaction that will result with a public listing on the Nasdaq.

Critics say the ventures pose conflicts of interest and open the door to potential corruption.At various points, Democrats have called for investigations into Trump’s crypto-related activities, proposed legislation aimed at limiting potential financial gains by the Trump family from memecoins, and walked out of a joint hearing on digital assets, citing concerns over the lack of discussion around the president’s involvement in the crypto space.Senate Democrats withdrew their support for a bipartisan stablecoin bill amid ongoing scrutiny of the president’s crypto ventures, though a second voting session could come as soon as May 26.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading question",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/everybody-in-the-world-is-trying-to-hoard-bitcoin-right-now-eric-trump?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

Steady inflows from institutional investors and the strength of the $100,000 support point to growing confidence in Bitcoin.Bitcoin (BTC) has struggled to break above $105,000 since May 10, leading traders to question whether the bullish momentum has faded. Although BTC managed to reclaim the $104,000 level, demand for leveraged long positions has dropped sharply, as indicated by the decline in the Bitcoin futures premium. Bitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: laevitas.chOn May 14, the annualized Bitcoin futures premium peaked at 7%, but then fell to 5%, which is near the neutral-to-bearish threshold and matches the level seen four weeks ago when BTC traded around $84,500. This decline in demand for leveraged bullish positions appears to be linked to broader macroeconomic uncertainty, since Bitcoin’s price has been closely following movements in the stock market.S&P 500 futures (left) vs. Bitcoin/USD (right), 30min. Source: TradingViewThe S&P 500 futures reversed early weakness on May 15, coinciding with Bitcoin’s rebound from $101,800 to $104,000. Investors seem more confident that the US Treasury will be compelled to inject liquidity after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that “supply shocks” could keep interest rates higher for longer than expected.Signs of economic weakness have also emerged. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that April’s Producer Price Index fell 0.5% from the previous month, while economists surveyed by FactSet had anticipated a 0.2% rise. According to Reuters, investors’ limited risk appetite is also influenced by ongoing global trade tensions, as the US–China tariff agreement remains only a temporary solution.US 10-year Treasury yields. Source: TradingView / CointelegraphDemand for fixed income has increased, with the yield on the 10-year US Treasury dropping to 4.45% after reaching 4.55% on May 14, reversing the previous week’s trend. Historically, Bitcoin tends to perform better when government bond yields are rising, as this signals reduced confidence in the Treasury’s ability to manage its debt.Bitcoin’s rally to $105,000 hinges on macroeconomic trendsTo assess whether traders are simply avoiding leverage or actively betting on a price decline, it is helpful to analyze Bitcoin options demand. Typically, periods of bearish sentiment push the BTC delta skew indicator above the neutral 6% threshold.Bitcoin 60-day options delta 25% skew (put-call) at Deribit. Source: laevitas.chContrary to expectations, Bitcoin put (sell) options have been trading at a discount compared to call (buy) options, signaling strong confidence in the $100,000 support level. However, the optimism seen on May 14 has faded, with the indicator now at a neutral -4%.Related: What the 10-year Treasury yield means for crypto yields and stablecoinsSince Bitcoin’s price has closely mirrored the US stock market, the chances of breaking above $105,000 depend heavily on macroeconomic developments, such as trends in the US Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and recession risks. Notably, Bitcoin’s high correlation with the S&P 500 rarely persists for more than two months.Net inflows of $320 million into US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on May 14 point to ongoing institutional demand. This suggests that investors are gradually shifting their perception of Bitcoin from a risk-on asset to a non-correlated instrument, which may reduce the likelihood of sharp price corrections, even in the absence of strong leveraged bullish positions.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Starting on May 30, FTX will send more than $5 billion to creditors “within 1 to 3 business days” through crypto firms BitGo and Kraken. In accordance with the reorganization plan, FTX said five groups of “convenience classes” would receive between 54% and 120% distribution of assets.

Solana’s ecosystem growth highlights renewed investor interest with a $4 billion realized cap increase and 731 million transactions.Solana (SOL) price tested its key resistance at $180 earlier this week, but the altcoin failed to establish a position above the level. Over the past few days, SOL has consolidated above the $170 mark, but prices have dropped 5.65% since May 14.Including the recent minor dip, Solana has formed a megaphone pattern on the 4-hour chart, a classic technical setup indicating increasing volatility. Solana 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe chart illustrates that the megaphone’s upper resistance trendline sits near $185, aligning with immediate resistance at $180. A confirmed breakout above this level could propel SOL toward the pattern’s first target at $210, calculated by measuring the widest part of the pattern and projecting it upward from the breakout point. If momentum is sustained, the next target will be $210, representing a 21% rally from current prices. A break above $200 would also trigger a psychological level that could attract further buying pressure.However, it is essential to note that a megaphone pattern can also be bearish. Failure to break $180 may lead to a pullback toward the 100-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $161 or the pattern’s lower support near $150. Volume confirmation on the breakout is a key trigger, as low volume could signal a false move, leading to an immediate reversal of the initial directional bias. Related: Solana network and DeFi activity suggest SOL price rally will continueSolana’s $4 billion realized cap growth and 731 million transactions signal momentumSolana is experiencing a revival in investor interest, with Glassnode reporting a 4% to 5% rise in 30-day capital inflows, matching XRP’s (XRP) growth.

This makes Canada, observers say, less competitive with other jurisdictions. Of particular concern is the perceived gap in peer-to-peer (P2P) payments in Canada, which stablecoins are uniquely qualified to fill. Stablecoins globally have grown significantly over the last five years. Source: DefiLlamaLocal law constrains stablecoin growth and threatens dollarIn 2022, as the crypto market reeled from the collapse of FTX and the implosion of the Terra stablecoin system, regulators worldwide began to look more critically at the crypto space. In Canada, the CSA updated regulations for crypto exchanges and brought stablecoins under its purview, classifying them as securities/derivatives. This hasn’t been a popular decision with Canada’s crypto industry.Morva Rohani, founding managing director of the Canadian Web3 Council, told Cointelegraph that the CSA’s case-by-case basis for considering stablecoin issuers and the lack of a federal framework make for a “patchwork” regulatory regime.“Canada’s reliance on securities law to regulate payment stablecoins introduces significant legal and operational uncertainty,” she said.Tanim Rasul, chief operating officer of Canadian crypto exchange NDAX, said that the CSA “got it wrong,” stating that other regulatory frameworks, like the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) law, were more appropriate. “I would just say, look at MiCA, look at the way they’re approaching stablecoins. It’s a payment instrument. It should be regulated as such,” he told a crowd at the Blockchain Futurist Conference in Toronto on May 13. It’s not just the EU. Singapore and the UAE have also introduced regulatory frameworks for stablecoins, and US senators are optimistic they will pass a stablecoin law by May 26.Related: What are the next steps for the US stablecoin bill?Rohani said Canada is “out of step with leading global jurisdictions [...] which have adopted tailored, prudential frameworks that recognize stablecoins as payment instruments.”This lack of alignment with other, more pro-stablecoin jurisdictions could have negative effects for the Canadian dollar (CAD), some worry.Som Seif, founder of Canadian investment firm Purpose Financial, said that the proliferation of other major stablecoins, mostly denominated in the US dollar, could threaten the use of the loonie (a nickname for the Canadian dollar) at home. “If Canada does not create the regulatory framework and environment that encourages the development of CAD stablecoins, consumers and businesses will default to using USD-pegged alternatives, eroding the relevance of CAD in global markets,” he said.Stablecoins provide cheaper P2P payments but reputation is also a roadblockMembers of the Canadian crypto industry have stated that stablecoins have a role to play in the country as well, given the purported lack of P2P payment networks available in the country. Speaking to Cointelegraph on May 13, Coinbase Canada CEO Lucas Matheson said, “It’s really important that we have a stablecoin for Canadians.” He said that the only options currently open were wire transfers, which “cost $45 and take 45 minutes of paperwork.” Rohani said that Interac e-Transfer, a Canadian funds transfer service, “remains the primary domestic P2P rail, operating through banks and credit unions.”Related: Stablecoins seen as ideal fit for real-time collateral managementCanada does have apps like PayPal and Wise, which support international P2P transfers, but those often come with high commissions and slow settlement times compared to stablecoins.Rohani said that while some crypto platforms allow for P2P transfers, they’re not widely used due to a lack of integration into mainstream financial services. Demand for more and different digital payment methods is growing in Canada, according to the 2024 digital payments report from Payments Canada, the owner and operator of Canada’s payment clearing and settlement infrastructure.But that demand may not translate directly into stablecoins. Crypto’s “journey towards financial integration among Canadians remains a distant prospect,” the report reads. Some 91% of Canadians have never used crypto as a payment. Ease of use and security were top priorities for international payment users. Source: Payments CanadaPayments Canada attributes the lack of interest to the assets being perceived as the “least secure payment method among Canadians compared to alternatives such as cash, credit cards, cheques, wire transfers and PayPal.”Even in the context of a central bank digital currency, which the crypto industry generally regards as a less favorable option to private, fiat-denominated stablecoins, interest just isn’t there. The survey found that 85% of respondents “did not envision themselves using a digital Canadian dollar and preferred their existing payment methods.”Is PM Carney pro-crypto?If more tailor-made regulations could integrate stablecoins with the mainstream payment options Canadians are comfortable with, it would still take a concerted effort from policymakers in Ottawa, where the Liberals have just won the federal elections.The crypto industry had cause for doubt. Liberal Prime Minister Mark Carney has previously expressed skepticism about cryptocurrency. In a speech as Governor of the Bank of England, he said they had failed as money. Still, he acknowledged stablecoins have a role to play in retail and wholesale payments. He said in 2021 that stablecoins should have access to central bank balance sheets — but only if strong protections were in place. “There’s been two systemic crises in money funds in little more than a decade [...] In baseball, it’s three strikes and you’re out. In cricket, it’s only the equivalent of one. For systemic payment systems, one is too many,” Carney stated.Kohani said, “With Mark Carney at the helm of the Liberal Party, we anticipate a pragmatic but regulation-first approach to crypto and stablecoins.”While his previous openness toward stablecoins suggests he’s open to the technology, he also “emphasizes the need for regulation, oversight and safeguards.”Another Liberal term, per Kohani, will likely mean the CSA continues to lead enforcement but could result in broader policy work, including a framework on stablecoins, “particularly if positioned as a tool for payments modernization and maintaining the relevance of the Canadian dollar.” Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/canada-lags-stablecoin-approach-room-to-catch-up?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

Speaking to Cointelegraph on May 13, Coinbase Canada CEO Lucas Matheson said, “It’s really important that we have a stablecoin for Canadians.” He said that the only options currently open were wire transfers, which “cost $45 and take 45 minutes of paperwork.” Rohani said that Interac e-Transfer, a Canadian funds transfer service, “remains the primary domestic P2P rail, operating through banks and credit unions.”Related: Stablecoins seen as ideal fit for real-time collateral managementCanada does have apps like PayPal and Wise, which support international P2P transfers, but those often come with high commissions and slow settlement times compared to stablecoins.Rohani said that while some crypto platforms allow for P2P transfers, they’re not widely used due to a lack of integration into mainstream financial services. Demand for more and different digital payment methods is growing in Canada, according to the 2024 digital payments report from Payments Canada, the owner and operator of Canada’s payment clearing and settlement infrastructure.But that demand may not translate directly into stablecoins. Crypto’s “journey towards financial integration among Canadians remains a distant prospect,” the report reads. Some 91% of Canadians have never used crypto as a payment. Ease of use and security were top priorities for international payment users. Source: Payments CanadaPayments Canada attributes the lack of interest to the assets being perceived as the “least secure payment method among Canadians compared to alternatives such as cash, credit cards, cheques, wire transfers and PayPal.”Even in the context of a central bank digital currency, which the crypto industry generally regards as a less favorable option to private, fiat-denominated stablecoins, interest just isn’t there. The survey found that 85% of respondents “did not envision themselves using a digital Canadian dollar and preferred their existing payment methods.”Is PM Carney pro-crypto?If more tailor-made regulations could integrate stablecoins with the mainstream payment options Canadians are comfortable with, it would still take a concerted effort from policymakers in Ottawa, where the Liberals have just won the federal elections.The crypto industry had cause for doubt. Liberal Prime Minister Mark Carney has previously expressed skepticism about cryptocurrency. In a speech as Governor of the Bank of England, he said they had failed as money. Still, he acknowledged stablecoins have a role to play in retail and wholesale payments. He said in 2021 that stablecoins should have access to central bank balance sheets — but only if strong protections were in place. “There’s been two systemic crises in money funds in little more than a decade [...] In baseball, it’s three strikes and you’re out. In cricket, it’s only the equivalent of one. For systemic payment systems, one is too many,” Carney stated.Kohani said, “With Mark Carney at the helm of the Liberal Party, we anticipate a pragmatic but regulation-first approach to crypto and stablecoins.”While his previous openness toward stablecoins suggests he’s open to the technology, he also “emphasizes the need for regulation, oversight and safeguards.”Another Liberal term, per Kohani, will likely mean the CSA continues to lead enforcement but could result in broader policy work, including a framework on stablecoins, “particularly if positioned as a tool for payments modernization and maintaining the relevance of the Canadian dollar.” Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/canada-lags-stablecoin-approach-room-to-catch-up?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

2025-05-15T14:50:00.000Z,"What the 10-year Treasury yield means for crypto yields and stablecoins","Understanding the 10-year Treasury yield: Definition and  importance              The 10-year Treasury yield is the interest rate that the US government pays to borrow money for 10 years.When the government needs cash, it issues bonds called Treasury notes, and the 10-year note is one of the most watched. The “yield” is the annual return you’d get if you bought that bond and held it until it matures. It’s expressed as a percentage, like 4% or 5%.Think of it as the government saying, “Hey, lend me $1,000, and I’ll pay you back in 10 years with some interest.” That interest rate and the yield move up or down based on demand for the bonds, inflation expectations and the overall economy. Because US Treasurys are considered safe (the government isn’t likely to default), the 10-year yield is a benchmark for “risk-free” returns in finance.Why does this matter for crypto? Well, crypto yields and stablecoins are part of the broader financial world, and the 10-year yield influences investor behavior, which ripples into the crypto market. Let’s dive into howDid you know? The crypto market has a Fear & Greed Index that gauges investor sentiment. When the 10-year Treasury yield spikes, it often triggers “fear” as investors worry about tighter money and less crypto speculation.                  Impact of the 10-year Treasury yield on global financial markets              The 10-year Treasury yield isn’t just a US thing — it’s a heavyweight in global financial markets, influencing everything from stocks to currencies to emerging economies. Since the US dollar is the world’s reserve currency and Treasurys are a global safe haven, changes in the 10-year yield send shockwaves worldwide. Here’s how:Stock markets: Higher Treasury yields can pull money out of stocks, especially growth stocks like tech companies, because investors can get better returns from bonds. In 2021, when yields spiked, tech-heavy indexes like the Nasdaq took a hit as investors shifted to safer assets. This shift can set the stage for how investors approach riskier assets like crypto.Borrowing costs globally: The 10-year yield influences interest rates worldwide. When it rises, borrowing costs for companies and governments increase, which can slow economic growth. For example, in 2022, rising yields contributed to tighter financial conditions, impacting everything from corporate loans in Europe to mortgage rates in Asia.Currency markets: A higher 10-year yield strengthens the US dollar, as investors flock to dollar-denominated assets. A stronger dollar can make cryptocurrencies, which are often priced in dollars, more expensive for international investors, potentially dampening demand. It also puts pressure on emerging market currencies, as their debt (often dollar-denominated) becomes costlier to repay.Emerging markets: Countries with weaker economies rely on cheap borrowing. When Treasury yields rise, capital flows out of riskier emerging markets into US bonds, causing volatility in their stock and bond markets. This can spill over into crypto, as investors in these regions may sell crypto assets to cover losses elsewhere.Inflation and monetary policy: The 10-year yield is a barometer for inflation expectations. If yields rise because investors expect higher inflation, central banks like the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates, tightening global liquidity. This can reduce speculative investment in assets like crypto, as seen in 2022 when aggressive rate hikes cooled markets.For crypto investors, this global impact sets the context. A rising 10-year yield might signal a tougher environment for crypto prices and yields, especially if global markets get shaky. Conversely, low yields often fuel risk-taking, boosting speculative assets like cryptocurrencies.                  Rising Treasury yields: Are safer returns stealing crypto’s yield appeal in 2025?              The 10-year Treasury yield, a critical indicator of global financial health, has shown notable volatility in 2025. As of May 9, 2025, the yield stands at approximately 4.37%-4.39%.The yield’s movement is driven by factors such as trade tensions, inflation expectations and Fed policy, with recent rate cuts not lowering yields as expected, diverging from historical trends.In the crypto space, yields are earned through activities like staking, lending and liquidity provision, often offering returns of 5%-10% or higher. However, the rising 10-year Treasury yield poses challenges. Research suggests that higher yields on safe assets can reduce demand for riskier crypto yields, as investors may prefer the stability of Treasurys. This competition for capital can lead to lower participation in crypto lending platforms, potentially pushing yields up to attract users, but overall market activity may decline. It is because many crypto platforms borrow money to operate, and their borrowing costs are tied to broader interest rates, which the 10-year yield influences. If rates rise, these platforms might pass on higher costs to users, affecting the yields you earn.                  How Treasury yields impact stablecoins              Stablecoins like Tether’s USDt (USDT) and USDC (USDC) are closely tied to traditional finance because their value is often backed by assets like cash, bonds or — you guessed it — Treasury notes. Here’s how the 10-year yield impacts stablecoins:Backing assets: Many stablecoins, like USDC, hold US Treasurys in their reserves to maintain their $1 peg. Higher Treasury yields, now at 4.39%, mean that stablecoin reserves earn more income, which could theoretically be passed on to users as yields. Regulatory complexity: Regulatory frameworks in some countries complicate this. In the European Union, the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation prohibits stablecoin issuers and crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) from offering interest to discourage their use as stores of value, though users can still generate yields through decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.Opportunity cost: If the 10-year yield is high, holding stablecoins (which often earn lower yields than riskier crypto) might seem less appealing compared to buying Treasurys directly. Investors might move money out of stablecoins, reducing the capital available for lending and potentially lowering stablecoin yields.Market sentiment: Rising Treasury yields often signal tighter monetary policy (like higher interest rates from the Fed), which can spook crypto markets. In 2023, for instance, when yields hit multi-year highs, crypto prices, including stablecoin-related tokens, felt the pressure as investors grew cautious. This can indirectly affect the yields you earn on stablecoins, as platforms adjust to market conditions.DeFi dynamics: In decentralized finance (DeFi), stablecoins are the backbone of lending and trading. If Treasury yields rise and traditional finance looks more attractive, DeFi platforms might see less activity, which could lower the yields on stablecoin pools. On the flip side, some DeFi protocols might boost yields to keep users engaged.Notably, there is a growing push for regulations that allow stablecoins to share yields with users, particularly in jurisdictions like the UK and US, where legislative efforts are ongoing. This debate is crucial, as allowing yield sharing could enhance stablecoin adoption, leveraging higher Treasury income, but regulatory clarity is needed to avoid legal risks.Did you know? Liechtenstein was one of the first countries to pass a full-fledged blockchain law — the “Blockchain Act” — in 2020.                  USDC vs. US Treasurys: Where should you park your money?              USDC staking offers higher but variable yields with moderate risk, while US Treasurys provide stable, low-risk returns backed by the government.When users stake USDC — by lending it on platforms like Aave or Coinbase — they earn variable returns, typically between 4% and 7% APY, depending on demand and platform risk.US Treasurys, especially 10-year notes, offer a fixed return; the yield stands at approximately 4.37%-4.39%. These securities are backed by the US government, making them one of the safest investments.While USDC can offer higher yields, it comes with added risks like smart contract bugs, platform failures and regulatory changes. Treasurys, though safer, offer limited upside.                  Implications of rising Treasury yields for crypto investors              For crypto investors, higher Treasury yields may reduce risk appetite, but tokenized Treasurys provide a secure alternative. If you’re thinking about staking your Ether (ETH) or lending USDC, knowing what’s happening with Treasury yields can give you a heads-up on whether yields might rise, fall or come with extra risks.For example:If yields are rising, it might be a sign that crypto yields could get more competitive, but it could also mean global markets are getting jittery. You might want to stick to stablecoins or safer platforms.If yields are low, investors might pour money into crypto, boosting yields but also increasing volatility. This could be a chance to earn more, but you’ll need to watch for risks.Plus, if you’re using stablecoins to park your cash or earn a little extra, the 10-year yield can hint at whether those yields will stay attractive or if you might find better returns elsewhere. And with its global reach, the yield can signal broader economic shifts that might affect your crypto strategy.Also, stablecoin holders may benefit from higher reserve income if regulations evolve to allow yield sharing, particularly in the US, though EU restrictions push yield generation to DeFi. Alternatively, traditional investors can explore tokenized Treasurys for blockchain-based Treasury exposure, potentially integrating them into broader portfolios as regulatory clarity emerges.A notable development in 2025 is the rise of tokenized Treasurys, digital representations of US Treasury bonds on blockchains. As of May 4, 2025, the total value of tokenized Treasurys has reached $6.5 billion, with an average yield to maturity of 4.13%, according to analytics from RWA.xyz. This trend offers crypto investors a way to earn yields comparable to traditional bonds, potentially mitigating the impact of rising Treasury yields on crypto markets.Moreover, the emergence of tokenized Treasurys signals a blurring of lines between traditional finance and decentralized ecosystems. These blockchain-native representations of government debt instruments not only offer yield stability but also reflect a broader trend: the integration of real-world assets (RWAs) into crypto markets. This development has the potential to reshape risk management practices, attract more conservative capital, and accelerate regulatory engagement with digital assets.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-the-10-year-treasury-yield-means-for-crypto-yields-and-stablecoins?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound
2025-05-15T14:50:00.000Z,"What the 10-year Treasury yield means for crypto yields and stablecoins","Understanding the 10-year Treasury yield: Definition and  importance              The 10-year Treasury yield is the interest rate that the US government pays to borrow money for 10 years.When the government needs cash, it issues bonds called Treasury notes, and the 10-year note is one of the most watched. The “yield” is the annual return you’d get if you bought that bond and held it until it matures. It’s expressed as a percentage, like 4% or 5%.Think of it as the government saying, “Hey, lend me $1,000, and I’ll pay you back in 10 years with some interest.” That interest rate and the yield move up or down based on demand for the bonds, inflation expectations and the overall economy. Because US Treasurys are considered safe (the government isn’t likely to default), the 10-year yield is a benchmark for “risk-free” returns in finance.Why does this matter for crypto? Well, crypto yields and stablecoins are part of the broader financial world, and the 10-year yield influences investor behavior, which ripples into the crypto market. Let’s dive into howDid you know? The crypto market has a Fear & Greed Index that gauges investor sentiment. When the 10-year Treasury yield spikes, it often triggers “fear” as investors worry about tighter money and less crypto speculation.                  Impact of the 10-year Treasury yield on global financial markets              The 10-year Treasury yield isn’t just a US thing — it’s a heavyweight in global financial markets, influencing everything from stocks to currencies to emerging economies. Since the US dollar is the world’s reserve currency and Treasurys are a global safe haven, changes in the 10-year yield send shockwaves worldwide. Here’s how:Stock markets: Higher Treasury yields can pull money out of stocks, especially growth stocks like tech companies, because investors can get better returns from bonds. In 2021, when yields spiked, tech-heavy indexes like the Nasdaq took a hit as investors shifted to safer assets. This shift can set the stage for how investors approach riskier assets like crypto.Borrowing costs globally: The 10-year yield influences interest rates worldwide. When it rises, borrowing costs for companies and governments increase, which can slow economic growth. For example, in 2022, rising yields contributed to tighter financial conditions, impacting everything from corporate loans in Europe to mortgage rates in Asia.Currency markets: A higher 10-year yield strengthens the US dollar, as investors flock to dollar-denominated assets. A stronger dollar can make cryptocurrencies, which are often priced in dollars, more expensive for international investors, potentially dampening demand. It also puts pressure on emerging market currencies, as their debt (often dollar-denominated) becomes costlier to repay.Emerging markets: Countries with weaker economies rely on cheap borrowing. When Treasury yields rise, capital flows out of riskier emerging markets into US bonds, causing volatility in their stock and bond markets. This can spill over into crypto, as investors in these regions may sell crypto assets to cover losses elsewhere.Inflation and monetary policy: The 10-year yield is a barometer for inflation expectations. If yields rise because investors expect higher inflation, central banks like the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates, tightening global liquidity. This can reduce speculative investment in assets like crypto, as seen in 2022 when aggressive rate hikes cooled markets.For crypto investors, this global impact sets the context. A rising 10-year yield might signal a tougher environment for crypto prices and yields, especially if global markets get shaky. Conversely, low yields often fuel risk-taking, boosting speculative assets like cryptocurrencies.

2025-05-15T14:02:30.000Z,"Tether blacklist delay allowed $78M in illicit USDT transfers: Report","Update (May 15 at 3:10 pm UTC): This article has been updated to include comments from Tether. A lag in Tether’s wallet blacklisting process allowed over $78 million in illicit funds to be moved before enforcement actions took effect, according to a new report from blockchain compliance company AMLBot.  Tether’s address blacklisting becomes effective only after a considerable delay from when the process is initiated on Ethereum and Tron, according the report published May 15.“This delay originates from Tether’s multisignature contract setup on both Tron and Ethereum, transforming what should be an immediate compliance action into a window of opportunity for illicit actors,“ the report reads.Tether’s blacklisting procedure is a multi-step process with a first transaction effectively warning of the upcoming blacklisting. First, a Tether administrator multisignature transaction submits a pending call to “addBlackList” on the USDT-TRC20 contract.This results in a public “submission” of the target address as a blacklist candidate. This is followed by a second multisignature transaction confirming the submission, resulting in an “AddedBlackList” emission, making the blacklisting effective.Related: Tether, Tron and TRM Labs jointly froze $126M USDT in 2024A warning on incoming blacklistingIn one example shared with Cointelegraph, an onchain transaction submitting a Tron address as a blacklist candidate took place at 11:10:12 UTC. The second transaction that actually enforced the action did not occur until 11:54:51 UTC on the same day, a 44-minute delay. In practice, this delay can be treated by owners of USDt about to be blacklisted as a notice to move their assets to avoid them being frozen. The report stated:“This delay between a freeze request and its on-chain execution creates a critical attack window, allowing malicious actors to front-run enforcement and move or launder funds before the freeze takes effect.“Example of USDt blacklisting transactions. Source: AMLBotThe report says that “for blockchain-savvy attackers, these delays are golden.” By tracking Tether’s calls in real time, a fraudster can be instantly alerted that their address is being targeted. When asked by Cointelegraph whether the delay is a technical limitation or just a delay in the actions of a multisignature wallet key holder, AMLBot researchers said that they cannot determine it without knowledge of Tether’s internal procedures.In a statement to Cointelegraph, a Tether spokesperson explained that “while any delay in enforcement should be examined, the idea that this represents a systemic loophole is both misleading and lacking perspective.” According to the company, it collaborates with law enforcement to freeze addresses on a daily basis. The statement continues:“Tether operates on public blockchains, where all activity is visible […] This transparency allows Tether, in collaboration with over 255 law enforcement agencies across 55 countries, to track, trace, and freeze illicit funds faster than most realize.“According to Tether, the delay cited in the report stems from its “multisignature governance model,\"" which is said to prevent unilateral freezes and protect the system's integrity. The company admits that the model also introduces a delay on enforcement, noting that “it’s a trade-off for responsible responsiveness to a $100+ billion ecosystem,” with improvements on the way:“We are actively refining this process to work to eliminate any potential advantage for bad actors. If you think you can use Tether to move illicit funds, think again.“Related: Tether stablecoin issuer and Tron launch financial crime unitNot just theoreticalAMLBot said its data shows that over $28.5 million in USDT was withdrawn during the delay between the two transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. This amount of freeze avoidance occurred between Nov. 28, 2017, and May 12, 2025. The average amount moved during the delay exceeded $365,000.Similarly, $49.6 million was reportedly withdrawn during freeze delay windows on the Tron blockchain, resulting in a total on Ethereum and Tron of $78.1 million. Exploiting this delay on Tron is not particularly rare, according to AMLBot:“170 out of 3,480 wallets (4.88%) on Tron blockchain exploited the lag before getting blacklisted. Each of these wallets made 2–3 transfers during the delay, withdrawing: Average: $291,970.“A Tether spokesperson said that “the $76 million referenced in this report should be put in context of the more than $2.7 billion in USD₮ that Tether has successfully frozen and blocked to date.” Tether has previously promoted its ability to freeze assets as a compliance feature. In 2024, Tether, Tron, and analytics firm TRM Labs cooperated to freeze over $126 million in USDT linked to illicit activity.Still, the AMLBot report raises questions about the effectiveness and speed of those enforcement actions.Magazine: Chinese Tether laundromat, Bhutan enjoys recent Bitcoin boost: Asia Express",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/tether-blacklist-delay-allowed-78-million-usdt-move?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

In 2024, Tether, Tron, and analytics firm TRM Labs cooperated to freeze over $126 million in USDT linked to illicit activity.Still, the AMLBot report raises questions about the effectiveness and speed of those enforcement actions.Magazine: Chinese Tether laundromat, Bhutan enjoys recent Bitcoin boost: Asia Express",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/tether-blacklist-delay-allowed-78-million-usdt-move?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

Flow now has tradable highlights like a “LeBron Dunk” or a “Steph Curry 3-Pointer” that live inside the NBA app and has commemorative NFTs tied to NFL game highlights in NFL All Day.But with Super Bowl ticket stubs and other digital mementos powered by blockchain, digital goods are proving they can unlock deeper in real life (IRL) fan experiences, courtside or on the field.“When you look at the amount of time folks are spending online or in digital environments, it’s only increasing,” Kahn said. “That’s really motivating brands to identify where their fans are spending time and where they can reach them where they’re at. It’s also a great way to engage a more global fan base simultaneously, versus in a more limiting, geo-targeted way, which caters more toward the global fan bases that want to engage with these brands.”Digital as a go-to-market strategyBecause fan bases have become more globalized, the online experience just happens to offer a faster, more accessible environment for digital goods, particularly collectibles, versus the current marketplace for physical goods that’s being hampered by enigmatic tariffs.Related: Are Donald Trump’s tariffs a legal house of cards?“Average NFT sales are up 7% quarter-over-quarter, with NFL All Day and NBA Top Shot delivering $2.5 million and $5.6 million, respectively,” Kahn said. “We’re also seeing total value locked (TVL) at an all-time high of $44.4 million on Flow, led by protocols like KittyPunch and other markets that offer next-gen investing and trading opportunities — a trend that’s signaling a broadening use case for blockchain and crypto beyond just NFTs.”Helping broaden the blockchain use case is the recently enhanced onramping and offramping technology that’s permeated throughout the industry, enabling a smoother user experience for those getting started in crypto and the world of digital commodities than what was available three years earlier.Per Kahn:A lot of blockchain companies are realizing the number of users they can have is capped if they don’t enhance the user experience.

One key innovation under discussion is trustless lending — allowing users to borrow against their Bitcoin without involving third-party intermediaries. “We don’t have the ability to lend against our Bitcoin in a trustless way without third-party intermediaries,” Duke said. “I would argue that is the second most important and second most used use case in the real world other than making payments.”Lending on BitcoinOne emerging solution involves Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs), which let users maintain control of their Bitcoin while locking it as collateral.

Source: Arthur Hayes/SubstackWhile that date may appear arbitrary and demand 900% BTC price gains, Hayes argued that the financial landscape could change in an instant, depending on the next US governmental administration.“I say 2028, because that is when the next US presidential election occurs and who knows what type of politician will win and what policies they will enact,” he said.While the presidency of Donald Trump has enacted various pro-crypto policies, this could begin to reverse if a shift in government were to occur. In Europe, meanwhile, an increasing desire to control and even suppress crypto use by the general population signals a growing divergence.“Not even China has banned the private ownership of Bitcoin because it knows it’s counterproductive and impossible,” Hayes wrote. “For you Euro-poor-peans, whose governments practice a less effective form of communism than China, don’t expect the European Central Bank (ECB) to learn this lesson without trying. Therefore, get your money out now!”Betting on a seven-figure breakoutAs Cointelegraph reported, Hayes has not been shy about predicting both short-term and longer-term BTC price expansion in the years to come.Related: Bitcoin looks ‘ridiculous’ as bulls attempt $2T market cap flip — AnalystIn April, he foresaw the return to $100,000, and before that, joined those seeing the mid-$70,000 zone as a likely local bottom.Multimillion-dollar targets for the next decade include those of major financial players such as Fidelity Investments.Michael Saylor, CEO of business intelligence firm Strategy, which has the world’s largest Bitcoin treasury of any public company, said this week that he envisaged a $10 trillion valuation.“My forecast for 2045 is 13 million a Bitcoin,” he added.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.
