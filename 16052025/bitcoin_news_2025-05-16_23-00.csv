Crypto analyst Javon Marks noted a breakout that could rival the explosive 2017 bull run. In a recent post on X, Marks highlighted a chart comparing the TOTAL3 index (total market cap of altcoins excluding Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum) against the US money supply, suggesting that altcoins may be on the verge of a significant rally. A rise in TOTAL3 against the US money supply suggests that altcoins are gaining value relative to the total liquidity in the US economy, reflecting increased investor interest and capital inflow into altcoins. TOTAL3/US Money supply.

Comparing 2021 and 2025, the chart mirrors the 2021 altcoin season when top altcoins surged 174% against Bitcoin’s 20% during the final leg.

Technical analyst Crypto Scient explained that the recent rise in altcoin market cap is yet to reflect a higher time frame (HTF) bullish trend shift. The analyst noted that the TOTAL2 trend remained bearish after hitting resistance at the $1.25 trillion level, and said, “Since both BTC and TOTAL are near the resistance zone and TOTAL2 still has some room, I am inclined to believe that we are distributing.”Similarly, Crypto commentator DonaXBT argued that a significant breakdown in Bitcoin's dominance trendline is essential for altcoins to experience a substantial move. The accompanying chart reveals that Bitcoin dominance is above 60%, with the weekly uptrend still intact. Bitcoin dominance.

This wave of profit-taking in margin markets has led to speculation that professional traders may not be fully confident in the current $104,000 price level.Bitfinex BTC margin longs, BTC. Source: TradingView / CointelegraphBitfinex margin longs dropped from 80,387 BTC to 65,889 BTC between April 16 and May 16. This shift marks a reversal from the strong bullish margin demand seen between mid-February and mid-March, a period when Bitcoin’s price fell from $97,600 to $82,500. The current decrease in margin longs is likely a sign of healthy profit-taking rather than a turn toward bearish momentum.The reasoning behind this move is not entirely clear, since Bitcoin’s jump above $100,000 occurred on May 8, about three weeks after the margin longs peaked. Still, it would be wrong to suggest that Bitfinex whales have adopted a bearish outlook. Their margin longs now total $6.8 billion, while margin shorts stand at just $25 million, showing a major gap between bullish and bearish positions.Bitfinex BTC margin shorts, BTC. Source: TradingView / CointelegraphThis difference is mainly due to Bitfinex’s low 0.7% annual interest rate for margin trading. By contrast, those using leverage for 90-day Bitcoin futures are paying a 6.3% annualized premium. This gap creates arbitrage opportunities.For example, one can open Bitcoin longs on margin and simultaneously sell an equivalent position in BTC futures to benefit from the rate difference. Margin traders also tend to have longer time frames and higher risk tolerance than average investors, so their position changes are less affected by short-term price moves.Whales unfazed by $105,000 resistance as BTC ETFs drive optimismTo rule out factors limited to margin markets, it is useful to look at Bitcoin options. If traders expect a correction, demand for put (sell) options rises, pushing the 25% delta skew above 6%. In bullish periods, this metric usually drops below -6%.Bitcoin 30-day options delta skew (put-call) at Deribit. Source: Laevitas.chThe current -6% options delta skew shows confidence in Bitcoin’s price, even though data over the past two weeks has ranged from neutral to slightly bullish.

Therefore, the drop in Bitcoin margin longs does not mean institutional traders are turning bearish, especially when considering the BTC options markets.Although this data does not reveal whether Bitcoin is any closer to breaking above $105,000, the fact that there are $6.8 billion in leveraged margin longs clearly shows that professional traders remain highly optimistic about the price outlook.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-16T15:00:00.000Z,"From debanking to a banking arms race—The rise of stablecoins","Opinion by: Megan Knab, CEO, Franklin PayrollThere are few historical examples of such a massive about-face for an industry, from banks debanking crypto businesses to now embracing stablecoins. If you talk to most crypto startup founders or companies with crypto on the balance sheet, they will all have war stories about finding, applying for and maintaining bank accounts. Over the past three years, over half of debanking complaints have been lodged against four American banks — Bank of America, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Citibank. Now, as the policies that discriminated against the crypto industry, like “Operation Chokepoint 2.0” and the recision of controversial accounting rule SAB 121, have been repealed, a new openness to blockchain technology from the finance sector is possible. It is imperative that the banking industry stop shunning crypto and start — at least understanding it — to stay competitive. How stablecoins are deployed will separate the banking winners and losers. From debanking to stablecoins Of course, stablecoins are not a new concept. For years, large institutions like JPMorgan and Santander have experimented with stablecoins and blockchains. Those experiments were around small functions like internal treasury reconciliation and interbank settlement. Much of this was also on private blockchains created by those banks. Implementing digital dollars on private chains, however, misses out on the core innovation of stablecoins.While the use case of stablecoins for international remittances is clear, we are just scratching the surface of the power of stablecoins on public networks. For example, stablecoins eradicate unauthorized payment disputes and enable far faster pay cycles. Payroll payments are also complex. Payday is a web of thousands of automated clearing houses, wires, comma-separated values and PDFs. The programmability of stablecoins enables companies to create efficiency among all these data structures, processing times, reconciliations and paycheck reporting. Many smaller banks are just now waking up to the opportunity to incorporate permissionless, public network stablecoins into their workflows. Similar to how many businesses started to investigate how AI might change their businesses with the 2022 release of ChatGPT, so too are banks needing to look at how stablecoins will upend money movement. Recently, Custodia Bank issued its own stablecoin, Avit, on Ethereum. Custodia’s users can access quick, cheap banking services that are hard to beat. This is an excellent example of implementation for other financial institutions to follow.Stablecoin adoption is increasing as the tech keeps improvingActive stablecoin wallets increased from 19.6 million in February 2024 to over 30 million in February 2025, according to Artemis and Dune. US President Donald Trump hopes to have stablecoin legislation on his desk by August 2025. Wyoming already did so in late March 2025.Recent: Mastercard links with Circle, Paxos for merchant stablecoin paymentsStablecoin infrastructure has improved significantly, and there is increased confidence in the security of stablecoins. 91% of the supply of stablecoins is fiat-backed, and only 8.5% are backed by collateralized crypto assets. Riskier algorithmic stablecoins have gone out of vogue.Incremental changes also make it easier for non-crypto businesses to use stablecoins. There are now simple solutions for many of the original UX problems with stablecoins.Additionally, more assets are moving onchain. Using stablecoins on public networks like Ethereum, payment companies will be better prepared to serve the future financial system. It’s not just stablecoins that are updating the financial system, either. Earlier this year, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said on Squawk Box he wants the SEC to “rapidly approve the tokenization of bonds and stocks.”For banks looking for a competitive advantage in a world of powerful fintechs, shifting interest rates and lower consumer savings, using the power of stablecoins to improve their products and their internal operations might be the most powerful decision they make. Opinion by: Megan Knab, CEO, Franklin Payroll.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-16T14:30:00.000Z,"Europe’s MiCA law is motion, but can the crypto industry keep up?","The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation — better known as MiCA — is now in its critical implementation phase. Designed to unify crypto regulation across all 27 EU member states, MiCA promises clarity, consumer protection and long-term market stability. But as implementation begins, cracks are already showing.In this week’s episode of Byte-Sized Insight, we explore the key provisions of MiCA now in force, particularly around stablecoins, and why some of the largest players in the market are refusing to comply.As of January 2025, crypto asset service providers (CASPs) began acquiring licenses to operate legally within the EU. A transitional or “grandfathering” period allows existing firms up to 18 months, depending on the member state, to comply. Still, with deadlines approaching, firms are being forced to act quickly.Stablecoins at bayOne of MiCA’s earliest and most controversial provisions involves stablecoins. Under the law, no stablecoin can be offered to EU users unless the issuer is authorized in the EU and publishes a regulator-approved white paper.Strict rules around asset reserves, governance, conflict of interest and marketing are also part of the package. Issuers are even banned from offering interest on tokens, removing a common incentive for adoption.Related: Stablecoin regulation next ‘catalyst’ for crypto industry — Aptos headThe world’s most-used stablecoin — Tether’s USDt (USDT) — has already announced it won’t seek MiCA compliance, meaning exchanges may soon be forced to delist it across the EU. This has major implications for liquidity, retail access and DeFi activity in the region.Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino told Cointelegraph’s Gareth Jenkinson at Token 2049:“The reason is not, uh, fear of regulations, fear of compliance… The problem that I had with um, with MiCA is that [the] license is very dangerous when it comes to stablecoins and I believe that it's even more dangerous for the small medium banking system in Europe.”Compliance is keyOn the flip side, other firms are leaning in. BitGo, a crypto custody firm, recently secured a MiCA-aligned license in Germany, positioning itself to serve institutional players across Europe. Brett Reeves, head of Go Network and European Sales at BitGo, told Cointelegraph the license is not just about compliance, but long-term strategic alignment with Europe’s evolving regulatory landscape.“We found that both BaFin and the European regulators have been relatively straightforward to deal with. Sometimes they have difficult questions, but they're there to make sure that our processes are in place and up to scratch.”We also spoke with Erwin Voloder, head of policy at the European Blockchain Association, who emphasized the need for consistent national-level interpretation and better guidance from regulators to prevent fragmentation.Listen to the full episode of Byte-Sized Insight for the complete interview on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

But there is a growing trend of increasingly violent and successful attacks, some of which have resulted in permanent harm and even death.The most recent incident in Paris, France compelled the French Ministry of the Interior to hold a meeting to address the rising trend. Here are just seven of the most high-profile attacks this year.Ledger founder and wife kidnapped, freedThe founder of crypto wallet Ledger, David Balland, and his wife, Amandine Balland, were kidnapped from their home on Jan. 21. The couple was put in a car, then separated and held at different locations. Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said that the kidnappers called an executive at Ledger and demanded a substantial ransom to be paid in cryptocurrencies. They reportedly mutilated Balland’s hand and sent Ledger a photograph to put pressure on the company.Some 230 officers participated in the search after Ledger alerted authorities. The police managed to locate and free David on Jan. 22 in Châteauroux, 30 miles southwest of his residence. One day later, after questioning arrested suspects and analyzing phone records, police were able to locate and rescue Amandine in Étampes, 80 miles north of Vierzon.A small portion of the ransom was paid.

Then, the attackers abandoned him some 50 kilometers away, his hands still tied, where police officers found him.The perpetrators didn’t manage to get his crypto, but they stole his car, his Rolex watch, his wallet and the keys to his house. Streamer shoots would-be crypto thievesIn November 2024, Kick streamer and cosplayer Kaitlyn Siragusa, known professionally as “Amouranth,” posted a screenshot on X of her crypto wallet. It held some $20 million in Bitcoin (BTC) and $80,000 in Ether (ETH). Months later, on March 2, 2025, three armed assailants allegedly broke into her home with the intent of stealing her cryptocurrency. She posted during the incident on X, stating, “I’m being too robbed at gunpont. I believe I shot one of them they wanted crypto is what they were yelling they pulled me out of bed.”Siragusa claimed that the assailants physically assaulted her before she discharged a weapon, after which they fled the scene. She said that police were testing blood left by suspects at the scene and posted video of the incident on her X profile. Kidnappers demand $50 million in crypto from Spanish businessmanOn March 29, police in São Paulo arrested a retired military police officer in connection with the week-long kidnapping of a Spanish businessman. Speaking to authorities, the businessman said he was approached by two men dressed in fake civil police uniforms and forced into a truck. Upon reaching a secluded location on the outskirts of the city, the assailants held him and demanded $50 million in cryptocurrency.Local media said the kidnappers drugged their victim with sleeping pills, but he was still able to escape when one of them went to the bathroom. After finding a filling station, he tipped off police, who seized one of the suspects as well as a pistol and ammunition. Daughter of crypto exchange owner fights off assailants The daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizat, co-founder and CEO of French crypto exchange Paymium, narrowly escaped a kidnapping attempt in Paris when passersby intervened.Three masked attackers tried to force Noizat’s daughter and her son into a van while they were taking a walk in Paris on May 13. En plein Paris, un homme a été violenté par des individus cagoulés, habillés tout en noir.

The assailants fled in a van, which was later found abandoned nearby. The victims sustained injuries and were evacuated to a local hospital. Local media reported that the Brigade for the Suppression of Banditry, a special police unit of the French Ministry of the Interior, was investigating the incident. Assailants target father of crypto entrepreneurKidnappers in Paris, France abducted the father of a French cryptocurrency entrepreneur on May 4. The attackers took him to Essonne, 35 miles away from the Paris street where they grabbed him, and cut off his finger. They made a video and sent it to his son, demanding 5 million euros in crypto. The victim’s son subsequently contacted police. The victim was held for two days before French police were able to find and rescue him. According to CNN, five people were arrested in connection with the kidnapping. Authorities have noted the striking similarities of the case to that of Balland, whose attackers also took him several miles from the city and mutilated his hand. “Obviously, there’s at least a link in the modus operandi. Now, whether it’s the same team or not is for the investigators to say,” said internal security expert Guillaume Farde.Authorities seek answers and crypto holders want securityThe rise in recent attacks has shaken the crypto industry. Ben Davis, co-founder and CEO at blockchain insurance firm Native, told Cointelegraph, “We used to see crypto wrench attacks predominantly happening when executives were abroad or traveling. However, high-profile cases like the kidnapping of Ledger’s co-founder show that attackers are now targeting individuals in their own homes, with more planning and precision than ever before.”Authorities are responding to concerns as well. On May 16, the French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau met with cryptocurrency professionals to address the recent uptick in violent crime against industry figures. For the foreseeable future, personal security, not just asset security, will be a defining theme of the crypto industry. Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky WeeAdditional reporting by Cath Jenkin",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/violent-crypto-robberies-rise-six-attacks-investors?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

The company announced the end of the lawsuit on March 19.Source: Stuart AlderotyAlderoty stressed that the latest court decision does not change the fact that XRP (XRP) is not a security, adding that the rejection is related to “procedural concerns with the dismissal of Ripple’s cross-appeal.”Why did the court refuse to grant the ruling?According to the court document, Torres denied the motion as “procedurally improper” since the SEC and Ripple failed to file the correct procedural motion to support the proposed settlement.“By styling their motion as one for ‘settlement approval,’ the parties fail to address the heavy burden they must overcome to vacate the injunction and substantially reduce the civil penalty,” the Judge wrote.An excerpt from the court’s rejection of the SEC-Ripple motion on May 15, 2025.

2025-05-16T13:55:35.000Z,"The emergence of Sonic and what it means for DeFi: Report","Why did Fantom reinvent itself as Sonic?Fantom was one of the pioneers of the directed acyclic graph (DAG) design for distributed ledgers. It featured fast finality and transaction fees of a fraction of a cent. However, Fantom relied on the Ethereum-derived account storage model and the EVM, which led to bloated storage and slow execution times.To address these bottlenecks and implement numerous other updates, the team behind Fantom rolled out Sonic, a fully independent new blockchain network. A new report by HTX  explores Sonic's technological background, its new tokenomics model and the innovations it brings to DeFi.  Download a full version of the report for free hereSonic’s technical architectureSonic runs on the proprietary SonicVM execution engine, which dynamically translates EVM bytecode into a faster internal format for speedier execution. It also optimizes heavy computations to prevent repeated work and pre-analyzes contract code to cache valid jump destinations. The SonicVM is fully compatible with the EVM, meaning that Fantom smart contracts can run seamlessly on the new blockchain.To address the issue of hefty onchain data storage and slow node synchronization, Sonic uses a new database design called SonicDB. SonicDB separates the blockchain state into two databases. It uses the LiveDB for fast access to the current state and execution, and the ArchiveDB for storing full historical data. This separation allows consensus nodes to cut data storage requirements by up to 90% and thus significantly reduces hardware requirements and synchronization time.For a more comprehensive explanation of the technical aspects of Sonic, download the full report for free here. Introducing the S tokenThe Sonic mainnet is powered by a new native token, S. Holders of FTM can convert their tokens to S at a 1:1 ratio using the official portal. S remains non-inflationary over the first six months following the mainnet launch in December 2024. Then, 6% of the initial supply will be minted to reward the early users of the blockchain. The full report offers in-depth coverage of several capital-efficient airdrop farming strategies with different risk profiles. Sonic rewards developers as well via its Gas Fee Monetization (FeeM) mechanism. Up to 90% of the transaction fees across participating applications are forwarded to developers, while the rest is routed to validators.Becoming a new hub for DeFiAndre Cronje, one of the founders of Fantom and the mastermind behind the Yearn.finance protocol is spearheading DeFi innovation on Sonic. Cronje unveiled Flying Tulip, a new DeFi platform that combines trading, liquidity pools and lending functionalities. The report discusses some innovations Flying Tulip brings to the Sonic blockchain.Flying Tulip is based on the same concept as Curve v2’s dynamic bonding curve. An AMM with a dynamic bonding curve adjusts its curvature based on how close the pool price is to an external price observed by an oracle. It also automatically concentrates the liquidity around the current price, simplifying liquidity management and enhancing capital efficiency. Flying Tulip introduces even faster equilibrium curve updates and narrower ranges alongside other improvements with a novel dynamic loan-to-value model.

2025-05-16T13:29:56.000Z,"51% attack on Ethereum more difficult than on Bitcoin — Justin Drake","Ethereum Merge architect Justin Drake told Cointelegraph that he believes it would be cheaper to launch a 51% attack on Bitcoin than on Ethereum.Drake said it would be “much cheaper to 51% attack Bitcoin” and that it would cost “on the order of $10 billion.”Drake led work on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake (PoS) implementation and was a principal architect in the Merge (the full PoS transition event). His remarks echo a May 14 X post by Grant Hummer, the co-founder of Ethereum-focused marketing and product company Etherealize. In the post, Hummer said that Bitcoin “is completely screwed because of its security budget.”Hummer claimed it would cost $8 billion to run a successful 51% attack, and he expects a successful attack to be “virtually certain” when the cost slips to $2 billion. A 51% attack occurs when a single entity or group controls over 50% of a blockchain network’s mining or staking power, gaining power over the network. Hummer added:“This will become blindingly obvious over the next decade. ETH is the only truly decentralized crypto-asset that can become the internet's [store of value].“Related: Coin Metrics research shows BTC and ETH are immune to 51% attacksEthereum attack would cost much moreDrake explained that “to have 100% control of the chain, you need 50% + 1 of stake.” He said that it would be extremely difficult and expensive, but far from impossible:“A rich nation state can probably pull it off.“At the time of writing, there was 34,168,987 staked Ether (ETH) worth nearly $89.6 billion. Consequently, half of all ETH has a current value of almost $44.8 billion.Staked Ether chart. Source: BeaconCha.inStill, a much higher investment would likely be needed. Ether has a current market cap of $316 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $25 billion (just over 8% of the market cap).The ETH needed for an attack is worth nearly 14.2% of the market cap and 180% of the 24-hour trading volume. An undertaking of that size would likely cause a significant ETH price appreciation, further increasing the cost of the attack.Related: Big miners pose a growing existential threat to BitcoinEthereum’s last line of defenseMatan Sitbon, the founder and CEO of blockchain interoperability developer Lightblocks, told Cointelegraph that Ethereum has an additional feature to defend against such attacks.“Ethereum’s ultimate security lies not solely in cryptography or protocol rules, but in the community’s powerful social and economic coordination mechanisms,“ he said.Drake also highlighted another advantage that he believes Ethereum has over Bitcoin. He explained that “if there is a 51% attack, the social layer can identify the attacker and socially slash it.” “This is a superpower of PoS that is not available with PoW,“ he added.Drake’s statement refers to the social layer, meaning the network’s human supermajority, which decides which software to run. Bitcoin’s simpler proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism has a smaller attack surface and longer reliability track record, but it lacks this feature.Pavel Yashin, Researcher at P2P.org, told Cointelegraph that “if the centralization is detected,” the community could resolve it with a new fork. The old token would end up being delisted, and the compromised chain would fall into irrelevancy.Hassan Khan, CEO at Bitcoin liquidity protocol Ordeez, told Cointelegraph that “the debate around the feasibility of a 51% attack remains open-ended — largely because while theoretically possible, in practice the barriers are extremely high.”He said that for Bitcoin, the necessary amount of computing power and energy “makes a sustained attack highly improbable,” while for Ethereum, “PoS introduces additional economic and governance deterrents.”Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-proponent-claims-bitcoin-is-screwed-a-51-attack-likely?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

2025-05-16T11:35:00.000Z,"AI vibe coding: what it is, why it’s risky, and how to stay safe","What is AI vibe coding?              AI vibe coding is a novel approach to software development that generates advanced, executable code based on well-crafted natural language user prompts. Yet another innovation fueled by artificial intelligence capabilities, AI vibe coding is proving to be a game-changer, especially for non-technical enthusiasts who can now experiment with software development and contribute to the ever-expanding technology ecosystem.At a fundamental level, AI vibe coding uses advanced machine learning algorithms to interpret natural language instructions and generate corresponding code in the desired software language. Users can input their requirements in plain language, such as “create a crypto website with a blog section and user login functionality,” and AI tools will generate the appropriate body of code needed to realize the project. This contrasts with traditional software development practices, which require the user to be skilled in programming languages and incorporate formal reviews along the journey. Notably, Charlie Shrem, an early Bitcoin pioneer, is bringing back the Bitcoin faucet — a site where people earn small amounts of Bitcoin by solving CAPTCHAs. His new site, 21million.com, is inspired by a 2010 version that helped spread Bitcoin in its early days. Right now, the site isn’t fully working and has no Bitcoin (BTC) to claim, but Shrem says it’s meant to help new users get started, with no hidden catch. He’s building it using AI tools, calling it “vibe coding.” Shrem, who once ran a major Bitcoin exchange, hopes this project will spark fresh interest in Bitcoin.While AI vibe coding can lead to faster software development results, there is a risk that the output generated from a vibe coding approach may not be adequately reviewed and signed off, which is where traditional coding practices continue to offer safeguards.Did you know? The term “vibe coding” was popularized by OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy, who described it as a way to “fully give in to the vibes,” effectively embracing AI-generated code without manually tweaking it.                  Key features of AI vibe coding              Unlike traditional coding, AI vibe coding requires no formal software development qualifications for users to get started. All you need to vibe code is an idea, with the ability to write it clearly using natural language prompts.Fundamentally, AI vibe coding is characterized by the following features:Natural language processing (NLP): AI vibe coding relies heavily on NLP to understand and process user instructions. Machine learning: As with all practical applications of AI, machine learning models trained on vast amounts of coding data are used to generate executable code based on user prompts.Real-time feedback: Users can receive and provide immediate feedback on the output, allowing for efficient code iteration and refinement.Accessibility: Vibe coding democratizes software development, enabling individuals without formal coding training to create functional applications. It lowers or eliminates the entry barriers into programming, empowering more users to participate in technology design and foster innovation from diverse perspectives.                  Why is AI vibe coding considered risky?              Despite its obvious benefits, AI vibe coding carries many risks that users must be aware of and mitigate as required. These risks range from security concerns to ethical and legal implications. Understanding the risks associated with AI vibe coding can help users alleviate potential issues and legal implications. Here’s a post by Matt Palmer outlining common safeguards to be considered for AI vibe coding. Some of the common risks associated with AI vibe coding are:Security concerns: AI-generated code might be susceptible to vulnerabilities if the underlying algorithms fail to account for security best practices. After all, AI learns from somewhere else! Therefore, inexperienced users might inadvertently create applications prone to cyberattacks, exposing sensitive data and risking user trust. This is particularly concerning when building applications that handle personal or financial information, as even a minor security flaw can have significant repercussions.Code quality: While AI tools can generate functional code, the quality and reliability of this code may vary, and will certainly not cater to all nuances commonly found in a real-world scenario. Similarly, AI’s understanding of user requirements might not always align perfectly with the intended functionality, leading to bugs and inefficiencies. Furthermore, the AI might not always follow the best coding practices, resulting in code that is difficult to maintain and scale. This can be especially problematic in large-scale projects where code quality is paramount.Ethical concerns: AI vibe coding can raise ethical and legal questions, especially concerning intellectual property. There might be ambiguity in ownership and copyright of AI-generated code, posing challenges for developers and users. Additionally, using AI in coding can lead to ethical concerns about job displacement and the devaluation of human expertise. It's crucial for developers and organizations to navigate these issues thoughtfully and responsibly, especially when relying on vibe coding practices for large-scale project development.Over-reliance on AI: As AI vibe coding becomes more prevalent, there is a risk of developers becoming overly reliant on AI tools, potentially diminishing their traditional coding skills and understanding. This reliance on AI can lead to a lack of deep technical knowledge, making it difficult for developers to troubleshoot issues or innovate independently. Continuous learning and skill enhancement are essential to maintain a balanced approach to software development.Explainability: While AI vibe coders may eventually even get the job done with vibe coding, they may not always have the skills required to review, debug, or refactor their code due to the lack of traditional software development skillsets, impacting the explainability and ultimately, reliability of code.Did you know? A major risk of AI vibe coding is the emergence of “slopsquatting,” a new type of supply chain attack where AI-generated code suggests non-existent package names, which attackers can exploit by creating malicious versions — talk about innovating to wreak havoc!                  How to vibe code safely              To mitigate the risks associated with AI vibe coding, users should adopt certain best practices. These practices can help ensure the AI-generated code is secure, reliable and ethically sound.Best practices to vibe code safely include:Learning best practices: Even though AI vibe coding simplifies the development process, users should still familiarize themselves with basic coding principles. This knowledge will help in understanding the AI-generated code and making necessary adjustments. It also enables users to identify potential issues and apply best practices, ensuring the code is robust and maintainable.Implementing security measures: It is crucial to ensure that the AI-generated code adheres to security best practices. As seen in a popular example on X, where a non-technical founder publicly shared his journey to building a web-based application exclusively with vibe coding, a lack of security considerations resulted in cyber threat actors attacking the application, resulting in it being taken down.Users should incorporate security checks and validations to safeguard their applications against potential threats. Regularly updating and patching the code, conducting security audits and following industry standards can help mitigate security risks.Regular audits and reviews: Conducting regular code reviews can help identify vulnerabilities and improve the overall quality of AI-generated code. Collaborating with experienced developers for feedback and insights is highly beneficial. Peer reviews and collaborative coding sessions can provide valuable perspectives and enhance code quality.Understanding ethical and legal implications: Users should know the ethical and legal ramifications of using AI-generated code. Consulting with legal experts on intellectual property and copyright issues can prevent future complications. Additionally, being informed of ethical guidelines and industry standards can help developers navigate the evolving landscape of AI in coding.                  How can blockchain support AI vibe coding?              Blockchain technology has the potential to enhance security, transparency and collaboration in AI vibe coding, complementing existing platforms like GitHub. Here’s how it can help:Securing AI-generated code: Blockchain’s decentralized and tamper-resistant design can help verify the integrity of AI-generated code. By recording hashes or proofs of code versions onchain (alongside repositories like GitHub), developers can detect unauthorized changes and maintain a secure, auditable history.Maintaining transparency: While platforms like GitHub track code changes, blockchain can provide an additional transparent, immutable log of modifications and interactions. This makes it easier to trace code evolution and verify its origins, improving accountability in collaborative AI projects.Enhancing collaboration: Blockchain-based systems can offer secure, trustless environments for developers to exchange code, feedback and ideas, complementing centralized platforms like GitHub. Though still emerging, these decentralized approaches have the potential to further strengthen collaboration in AI development.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/ai-vibe-coding-what-it-is-why-its-risky-and-how-to-stay-safe?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

He said moving even 10% of that market onchain could significantly boost DeFi’s growth.“You basically more than quadruple TVL in all of DeFi,” he said, underscoring how the industry is still in its early stages. Consensus chairman Michael Lau (left) with Animoca Brands chairman Yat Siu (right) at the Consensus mainstage in Toronto, Canada. Source: CointelegraphWeb3-based education tools to drive crypto adoptionSiu said that Web3-based financial tools for the education sector could drive mass crypto adoption, especially among the young and unbanked.“The first unbanked are the kids,” he said. “If a student receives a loan onchain and pays it back onchain — which is regulated, better, faster, cheaper — they become onboarded for crypto for life.” Siu compared the situation to how PayPal and Venmo scaled by offering essential services to underserved users. He suggested that student loans could serve as crypto’s entry into the mainstream.The executive also highlighted Animoca Brands’ recent investment in Pencil Finance, a startup providing crypto-native student loans. Siu said the project operates in the Philippines and Indonesia, and plans to expand to the US. On April 30, Pencil Finance announced a $10 million student loan financing initiative to provide cheaper, blockchain-backed loans. Siu previously said in an interview that the industry needs these “positive-sum use cases” that everyone understands.

2025-05-16T07:30:00.000Z,"Tether AI: What it is and why it matters for crypto and AI","What is Tether AI?              Tether AI is an open-source, decentralized artificial intelligence (AI) platform launched by Tether, the company behind the Tether USDt (USDT) stablecoin. Unlike traditional AI services that depend on centralized servers and require application programming interface (API) keys, Tether AI runs on a distributed peer-to-peer (P2P) network, offering enhanced privacy, autonomy and resilience. Designed to be modular and composable, Tether AI can operate on any hardware, whether mobile, desktop or edge devices, without centralized control or a single point of failure. A core innovation of Tether AI is its integration with cryptocurrency infrastructure. It natively supports Bitcoin (BTC) and USDt payments using Tether’s Wallet Development Kit (WDK), enabling seamless onchain transactions. This makes Tether AI one of the first AI platforms to offer direct crypto payment functionality at the protocol level.According to Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether AI, it is a “fully open-source AI runtime, capable of adapting and evolving on any hardware and device, no API keys, no central point of failure, fully modular and composable, WDK-infused to enable USDT and Bitcoin payments.”Ardoino said Tether AI's primary objective is to create the “ideal technological foundation” for realizing the AI vision of Isaac Asimov, the celebrated science fiction author behind I, Robot and The Robot Series. In a separate post on X (written in Italian), Ardoino further asserted, “AI will, in the coming decades, become part of the very fabric of the universe.”                  How Tether AI personalizes infinite intelligence              Tether AI is built around the AI runtime structure of “personal infinite intelligence,” which envisions customizable AI agents tailored to individual user needs and device capabilities. Developers can leverage Tether’s open-source WDK, launched in November 2024, to create mobile, desktop and web wallets with complete self-custodial control.The platform enables native payments in USDt and Bitcoin to be processed directly over a peer-to-peer network, eliminating reliance on centralized payment processors. It emphasizes user ownership, ensuring individuals control their assets without intermediaries. This decentralization-first model supports Tether’s mission of making AI accessible and censorship-resistant. Ardoino has been critical of the AI industry’s dependence on centralized APIs and cloud platforms; Tether AI aligns with this mission.The project will facilitate integrating native USDt and Bitcoin payments into autonomous systems and software agents. The objective is to create a decentralized, censorship-resistant foundation for AI tools.Did you know? Tether AI CEO Paolo Ardoino favors locally executable AI models that can run directly on the user’s device, be it a smartphone or laptop, eliminating the need for third-party servers. This ensures that data stays local and allows for offline use.                  How Tether AI brings decentralized intelligence to Keet and Pear              Tether AI is expected to integrate with Tether’s existing peer-to-peer ecosystem, including Keet, a decentralized messaging app, and Pear, a framework for building P2P applications. Initially unveiled in December 2024, the platform is slated for launch in 2025, marking Tether’s strategic entry into decentralized AI with embedded crypto functionality.This initiative is part of a broader corporate shift announced in April 2024, which had Tether restructuring its operations to create dedicated units for AI and peer-to-peer technologies, such as Tether Data. Tether is actively developing Tether AI and a suite of AI-powered applications. These include a real-time AI translation tool for international communication, a voice assistant for hands-free platform and application control, and a Bitcoin wallet assistant to streamline transaction management. Tether, under Ardoino, views AI as a cornerstone of technological advancement.Tether’s AI expansion follows the company reporting $1 billion in operating profit for Q1 2025, mainly from US Treasury returns. With $149.3 billion in total assets and $5.6 billion in excess reserves, Tether remains dominant in the stablecoin sector. Its move into AI underscores a commitment to innovation, positioning the firm at the forefront of crypto and next-generation intelligent technologiesDid you know? Decentralized intelligence allows AI models to run across a network of devices instead of a single centralized server. This approach reduces the risk of data breaches, avoids single points of failure and gives users greater control over their data.                  Key features of Tether’s WDK              Tether’s WDK, launched in November 2024, is an open-source framework designed to simplify the creation of self-custodial wallets across mobile, desktop and web platforms. The WDK empowers developers to build crypto wallets that support secure, peer-to-peer transactions without relying on centralized infrastructure.Key features of the WDK include:Modularity: WDK has modules that enable developers to customize wallet functionalities based on specific use cases, including payments, storage or integration with decentralized applications (DApps). Pre-built components: WDK includes pre-built components for encryption, transaction management, key recovery and cross-platform compatibility, making it highly adaptable for beginners and advanced developers.User sovereignty: All wallets built using WDK enable full self-custody, meaning users retain exclusive control over their private keys and funds. Integration with other P2P technologies: WDK supports seamless integration with Tether's other peer-to-peer technologies, including Keet and Pear.In the context of Tether AI, WDK will play a critical role in embedding native crypto payments into decentralized AI applications, allowing automated agents and users to transact onchain with minimal friction. By bridging wallet development with AI and Web3 infrastructure, WDK advances Tether’s vision of a decentralized digital economy.Did you know? In collaborative AI development, models are trained and improved by a global community without central ownership. This open-source approach can lead to fairer, more inclusive AI systems that are free from the biases or profit motives of centralized tech giants.                  Implications of merging AI with blockchain are just beginning              Tether AI signals a transformative shift in how AI can be developed, deployed and monetized in a decentralized ecosystem.

2025-05-16T05:59:44.000Z,"Crypto gaming interest drops in April, overall ecosystem healthier: DappRadar","Blockchain gaming user activity dipped and funding slowed in April, but the overall ecosystem is healthier and maturing, according to blockchain analytics platform DappRadar.User activity dropped 10% over April, with blockchain gaming reaching a 2025 low of 4.8 million daily Unique Active Wallets, DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said in the platform’s April Games Report.Gaming dominance over the decentralized app industry also fell and is now tied with decentralized finance at 21%. Gherghelas said it’s clear user attention is shifting away from gaming, but under the surface, new infrastructure went live, major publishers doubled down, and high-quality games edged closer to launch.Source: DappRadar“The blockchain gaming industry isn’t dead — it’s evolving. It’s moving from noise to signal,” she said.“Teams are building, and capital continues to flow into the space. What we might be seeing is a healthier ecosystem — one driven less by speculative play-to-earn mechanics and more by users who have a genuine interest in gameplay, asset ownership and community.”April’s blockchain gaming investment activity also dropped 69% from March, reaching $21 million.Weaker projects die off, funds shift to buildersGherghelas said part of the drop is because investor and user interest is increasingly shifting toward real-world assets and artificial intelligence.Another factor is the macroeconomic landscape, with ongoing market uncertainty weighing on investor sentiment, making capital harder to secure for startups.Gherghelas said weaker projects “are falling away,” and funds are flowing into other projects that “are quietly laying the groundwork for the next generation of blockchain games.”Blockchain gaming funding has seen a sharp drop since last year. Source: DappRadar“Investors are now optimizing for sustainable models, player engagement, and actual retention, not just token hype,” she added. “This shows that the market’s clearly in reset mode.”Gherghelas noted that “66% of all blockchain game funding in 2025 so far has gone to infrastructure,” signaling a more mature market.Related: Crypto gaming has mixed Q1 as deals jump, investment totals dip: DappRadarMainstream gaming companies are also still experimenting with blockchain-powered games, with Gherghelas pointing to Ubisoft's partnership with Immutable, and Sega adding non-fungible tokens and play-to-earn mechanics to its game, KAI: Battle of Three Kingdoms, as prime examples.“April 2025 wasn’t a record-breaking month for blockchain gaming, and that’s okay.

Source: L2beatFraud proofs assume transactions are invalid until proven valid, while validity proofs assume transactions are valid only if proven valid with cryptographic evidence.“Our goal is for the training wheels to come off completely and to reach Stage 2 decentralization on Ethereum, and simultaneously steam forward with our work on Bitcoin too,” said Eli Ben-Sasson, co-founder and CEO of StarkWare, the developer behind Starknet. “Stage 2” decentralization is the point where the network will be fully autonomous and community-governed. Only three small layer-2 scaling platforms have reached this stage, according to L2beat. Related: Vitalik Buterin says rollups must prove security before decentralizingButerin introduced the concept of “training wheels” or three stages for Ethereum scaling rollup projects at various phases of development in 2022.Base leads layer-2 ecosystemThe Coinbase layer-2 network Base is the leader of the sector in terms of value locked, with $14.7 billion, giving it a market share of 33%. Comparatively, Starknet has a market share of 1.4%. The total value secured onchain in the layer-2 ecosystem is $44.2 billion.

2025-05-16T05:18:22.000Z,"Stablecoin bill passes in Northern Marianas as House overrides veto","The Pacific US territory of the Northern Mariana Islands has passed a bill allowing its small constituent island of Tinian to launch a stablecoin, overriding an earlier veto by the territory’s governor.The 20-member Northern Mariana Islands House voted 14-2 to undo Governor Arnold Palacios’ April 11 veto of the bill, which allows the Tinian local government to issue licenses to internet casinos and includes a provision for the Tinian treasurer to issue, manage and redeem a “Tinian Stable Token.” The territory’s nine-member Senate had revived the bill on May 9, voting 7-1 in a two-thirds majority to override the veto, which then needed a two-thirds majority in the House to pass.Representative Marissa Flores (top left) had urged for “thoughtful deliberation” on the internet gaming and stablecoin bill. Source: YouTubeOriginally, a four-member Tinian delegation to the Marianas legislature had unanimously passed the bill to Governor Palacios on March 12.It may put the Tinian government in the lead to be the first US public entity to issue a stablecoin, which it must do before July if it’s to beat the state of Wyoming government, which is aiming to issue a stablecoin by then.Tinian has just over 2,000 residents and a largely tourism-based economy. Its local government, the Municipality of Tinian and Aguiguan, is one of four municipalities in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, a US territory in the Pacific Ocean north of Guam.Governor Palacios said in a letter that he vetoed the bill as it “presents several legal issues and may be unconstitutional,” would regulate an activity that could not “be clearly restricted” to Tinian and that it lacked needed enforcement measures to counter illegal gambling.The stablecoin is called the Marianas US Dollar (MUSD) and will be backed by cash and US Treasury bills held in reserve by the Tinian Municipal Treasury, according to statements shared with Cointelegraph in March.The Tinian government chose local tech services firm Marianas Rai Corporation as the exclusive infrastructure provider for MUSD, which will be launched on the eCash blockchain, a network that rebranded from Bitcoin Cash ABC in 2021 and is a fork of Bitcoin Cash, a blockchain forked from Bitcoin.A Marianas Rai Corp. spokesperson did not comment beyond telling Cointelegraph the company would announce more on MUSD on May 19.“Bitter pill to swallow”Before the vote, House lawmakers heard from the public and discussed overturning Governor Palacios’ veto before they voted it through, with independent House floor leader Marissa Flores airing concerns over the bill.Marianas Rai Corp. co-founder and technology chief Vin Armani had urged lawmakers to undo the veto, saying the bill would “attract billions of dollars of investment and tax revenue” from the crypto industry without the government having to pitch in.Clyde Norita, a Marianas Rai Corp. director and local legal cannabis mogul, told the House that the local economy was “dying out” and the bill would allow business in the region “without affecting our culture, without affecting our environment, without affecting our immigration status.”Representative Flores, who voted against the override, said, \""Every time we talk about casinos, there’s always some kind of bitter pill to swallow.”Related: Stablecoin regulation 'next catalyst' for crypto industry — Aptos head “It is true, we are in dire need of money, but what I don’t like is when we are desperate, and we are now forced to make a decision because we are desperate once again,” she added. “Every time we’re desperate, it always seems that we come back to casinos.”“I don’t like to be pushed to a corner to make a decision based on fear,” Flores said.Others were more supportive of the measure, with Republican Representative Patrick San Nicolas, a Tinian delegation member who initially voted on the bill, saying it would help pull the region out of “a deep economic crisis.”“We need this legislation to unlock our potential,” he added. “This bill does not depend on tourists or federal subsidies — it builds a digital industry generating revenue from a licensed jurisdiction.”Legal Panel: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/northern-marianas-house-overrides-veto-passes-stablecoin-bill?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

The market has since cooled as well. “I think the fact that we’re still healthy without one of those to drive it is a really, really good sign,” Guthrie said.Market more mature this cycle, despite memecoin hype The overall crypto market capitalization hit a new all-time high of $3.71 trillion on Dec. 9 last year, with many cryptocurrencies also registering significant price gains, according to CoinMarketCap. During this cycle, there has also been a growing trend of companies, such as video game retailer GameStop Corporation, and countries, Ukraine possibly being one of the latest, adopting crypto for treasuries and reserves.“I think this is starting to feel like a more mature market that is really settling on its use case, its value prop,” Guthrie said.“I know there has been a bit of memecoin stuff, particularly around Solana, but it doesn’t seem anywhere near as prevalent as the previous kind of hype has been,” he added. Related: Bitcoin experiencing ‘shakeout,’ not end of 4-year cycle: AnalystsThere was a surge in memecoin activity after the launch of US President Donald Trump’s memecoin on Jan. 18, when Pump.fun usage recorded an all-time high of $3.3 billion in weekly trading volume. However, enthusiasm for memecoins dropped after a series of bad launches and rug pulls, killed off investor interest, such as the Libra (LIBRA) rug. Ultimately, Guthrie thinks there is still a “lot of innovation to do,” and it’s still “very early days,” but the market has matured and has greater sustainability compared to previous cycles. Additional reporting by Sam Bourgi.Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-lacks-frothy-use-case-good-sign-wisdomtree?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

The DOJ said several defendants have been arrested, while two others are believed to be living in Dubai.Many of the suspects, with aliases like “Goth Ferrrari” and “The Accountant,” come from California, mostly aged between 18 and 22. The group allegedly began operating in October 2023, evolving from friends while playing online games to what the DOJ describes as participating in a “cyber-enabled racketeering conspiracy.”Hacking, burglarizing and launderingThe DOJ said group members were tasked with everything from hacking databases, cold calling crypto holders to conduct social engineering attacks to even burglarizing houses to steal crypto hardware wallets.Others were involved in laundering the stolen proceeds, which the DOJ claimed amounted to $263 million. Over $230 million resulted from a single instance on Aug. 18, 2024, when Lam fraudulently obtained over 4,100 Bitcoin (BTC) from a victim.Related: Crypto exchange CEO’s daughter fights off brazen kidnappers in ParisThe DOJ said Lam also hacked into another victim’s iCloud account to watch their movements, while defendant Marlon Ferro would break into their house to steal crypto hardware wallets.Virtual private networks, crypto mixer protocols and exchanges using “peel chains” were used to make it harder to trace the illicit activity, the DOJ said.

I understand they can’t possibly take all these service calls but there should be a way to do it, maybe some sort of social way to call out a particular account.” At least one user replied in the comments saying the fraudsters had targeted them, while Web3 OG Dovey Wan said she had also been deepfaked in a similar scam. Source: Dovey WanFBI and crypto founder says vigilance is key to avoid scams Nailwal suggests the best way to avoid being duped by these types of scams is to never install anything during an online interaction initiated by another person and to keep a separate device specifically for accessing crypto wallets. Related: AI deepfake attacks will extend beyond videos and audio — Security firmsMeanwhile, the FBI says to verify the identity of anyone who contacts you, examine all sender addresses for mistakes or inconsistencies, and check all images and videos for distorted hands, feet or unrealistic facial features. At the same time, the agency recommends never sharing sensitive information with someone you have never met, clicking links from people you don’t know, and setting up two-factor or multifactor authentication. Magazine: Deepfake AI ‘gang’ drains $11M OKX account, Zipmex zapped by SEC: Asia Express",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-officials-targeted-deepfake-phishing-attacks-fbi?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

Legacy forex and payments platforms often extract large fees for servicing cross-border cash transfers and stand to lose out on revenue if regulated stablecoins become accepted as a cheaper, faster alternative, O’Leary said at the Toronto conference. “Currency trading is a multi-trillion dollar market — and it’s old and ugly and inefficient,” O’Leary said, adding that “[ t]he biggest threat to that monopoly or oligopoly is a regulated stablecoin.” “Once that’s approved, the multi-trillion dollar FX market becomes efficient, transparent, and inexpensive,” he said. Kevin O’Leary speaking at Consensus.

The financial services industry. They hate this idea, and they’re working very hard to stop that bill from happening right now,” he added.O’Leary said regulatory clarity for stablecoins may be a precursor to broader cryptocurrency reform that could potentially unlock trillions of dollars in institutional capital.“When this language comes out, people will see really good refinement, a lot of progress, on things like consumer protection, bankruptcy protection, and ethics,” US Senator Kirsten Gillibrand said during an event hosted by Coinbase's lobbying arm, Stand with Crypto.As of May 15, stablecoins are collectively worth nearly $250 billion in market capitalization, according to data from CoinGecko.

Though Grewal said there were disputes over “substantial issues that need to be addressed” in the bill, he hinted that Trump’s involvement in the industry was a “complicating factor.” “The discussion around the president's support for a certain memecoin or two and other efforts does add a certain level of challenge to the effort to get Democrats and Republicans aligned on the right way to regulate the [spot market], but I have confidence that the Senate and the House are going to sort all that out,” said Grewal.Paul Grewal (right) on stage at Consensus in Toronto on May 15.

Steady inflows from institutional investors and the strength of the $100,000 support point to growing confidence in Bitcoin.Bitcoin (BTC) has struggled to break above $105,000 since May 10, leading traders to question whether the bullish momentum has faded. Although BTC managed to reclaim the $104,000 level, demand for leveraged long positions has dropped sharply, as indicated by the decline in the Bitcoin futures premium. Bitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: laevitas.chOn May 14, the annualized Bitcoin futures premium peaked at 7%, but then fell to 5%, which is near the neutral-to-bearish threshold and matches the level seen four weeks ago when BTC traded around $84,500. This decline in demand for leveraged bullish positions appears to be linked to broader macroeconomic uncertainty, since Bitcoin’s price has been closely following movements in the stock market.S&P 500 futures (left) vs. Bitcoin/USD (right), 30min. Source: TradingViewThe S&P 500 futures reversed early weakness on May 15, coinciding with Bitcoin’s rebound from $101,800 to $104,000. Investors seem more confident that the US Treasury will be compelled to inject liquidity after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that “supply shocks” could keep interest rates higher for longer than expected.Signs of economic weakness have also emerged. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that April’s Producer Price Index fell 0.5% from the previous month, while economists surveyed by FactSet had anticipated a 0.2% rise. According to Reuters, investors’ limited risk appetite is also influenced by ongoing global trade tensions, as the US–China tariff agreement remains only a temporary solution.US 10-year Treasury yields. Source: TradingView / CointelegraphDemand for fixed income has increased, with the yield on the 10-year US Treasury dropping to 4.45% after reaching 4.55% on May 14, reversing the previous week’s trend. Historically, Bitcoin tends to perform better when government bond yields are rising, as this signals reduced confidence in the Treasury’s ability to manage its debt.Bitcoin’s rally to $105,000 hinges on macroeconomic trendsTo assess whether traders are simply avoiding leverage or actively betting on a price decline, it is helpful to analyze Bitcoin options demand. Typically, periods of bearish sentiment push the BTC delta skew indicator above the neutral 6% threshold.Bitcoin 60-day options delta 25% skew (put-call) at Deribit. Source: laevitas.chContrary to expectations, Bitcoin put (sell) options have been trading at a discount compared to call (buy) options, signaling strong confidence in the $100,000 support level. However, the optimism seen on May 14 has faded, with the indicator now at a neutral -4%.Related: What the 10-year Treasury yield means for crypto yields and stablecoinsSince Bitcoin’s price has closely mirrored the US stock market, the chances of breaking above $105,000 depend heavily on macroeconomic developments, such as trends in the US Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and recession risks. Notably, Bitcoin’s high correlation with the S&P 500 rarely persists for more than two months.Net inflows of $320 million into US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on May 14 point to ongoing institutional demand. This suggests that investors are gradually shifting their perception of Bitcoin from a risk-on asset to a non-correlated instrument, which may reduce the likelihood of sharp price corrections, even in the absence of strong leveraged bullish positions.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Solana 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe chart illustrates that the megaphone’s upper resistance trendline sits near $185, aligning with immediate resistance at $180. A confirmed breakout above this level could propel SOL toward the pattern’s first target at $210, calculated by measuring the widest part of the pattern and projecting it upward from the breakout point. If momentum is sustained, the next target will be $210, representing a 21% rally from current prices. A break above $200 would also trigger a psychological level that could attract further buying pressure.However, it is essential to note that a megaphone pattern can also be bearish. Failure to break $180 may lead to a pullback toward the 100-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $161 or the pattern’s lower support near $150.

2025-05-15T17:00:00.000Z,"Canada lags with stablecoin approach, but there’s room to catch up","The slow adoption of stablecoins in Canada has some local crypto industry observers concerned that the country is falling behind.The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) classified stablecoins as “securities and/or derivatives” in December 2022 after the FTX debacle that shook markets and turned many lawmakers against the crypto industry.Regulating stablecoins as a security has seen few local stablecoin issuers arise, but in the United States and the European Union, softening regulations have seen significant growth in the stablecoin market. This makes Canada, observers say, less competitive with other jurisdictions. Of particular concern is the perceived gap in peer-to-peer (P2P) payments in Canada, which stablecoins are uniquely qualified to fill. Stablecoins globally have grown significantly over the last five years. Source: DefiLlamaLocal law constrains stablecoin growth and threatens dollarIn 2022, as the crypto market reeled from the collapse of FTX and the implosion of the Terra stablecoin system, regulators worldwide began to look more critically at the crypto space. In Canada, the CSA updated regulations for crypto exchanges and brought stablecoins under its purview, classifying them as securities/derivatives. This hasn’t been a popular decision with Canada’s crypto industry.Morva Rohani, founding managing director of the Canadian Web3 Council, told Cointelegraph that the CSA’s case-by-case basis for considering stablecoin issuers and the lack of a federal framework make for a “patchwork” regulatory regime.“Canada’s reliance on securities law to regulate payment stablecoins introduces significant legal and operational uncertainty,” she said.Tanim Rasul, chief operating officer of Canadian crypto exchange NDAX, said that the CSA “got it wrong,” stating that other regulatory frameworks, like the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) law, were more appropriate. “I would just say, look at MiCA, look at the way they’re approaching stablecoins. It’s a payment instrument. It should be regulated as such,” he told a crowd at the Blockchain Futurist Conference in Toronto on May 13. It’s not just the EU. Singapore and the UAE have also introduced regulatory frameworks for stablecoins, and US senators are optimistic they will pass a stablecoin law by May 26.Related: What are the next steps for the US stablecoin bill?Rohani said Canada is “out of step with leading global jurisdictions [...] which have adopted tailored, prudential frameworks that recognize stablecoins as payment instruments.”This lack of alignment with other, more pro-stablecoin jurisdictions could have negative effects for the Canadian dollar (CAD), some worry.Som Seif, founder of Canadian investment firm Purpose Financial, said that the proliferation of other major stablecoins, mostly denominated in the US dollar, could threaten the use of the loonie (a nickname for the Canadian dollar) at home. “If Canada does not create the regulatory framework and environment that encourages the development of CAD stablecoins, consumers and businesses will default to using USD-pegged alternatives, eroding the relevance of CAD in global markets,” he said.Stablecoins provide cheaper P2P payments but reputation is also a roadblockMembers of the Canadian crypto industry have stated that stablecoins have a role to play in the country as well, given the purported lack of P2P payment networks available in the country. Speaking to Cointelegraph on May 13, Coinbase Canada CEO Lucas Matheson said, “It’s really important that we have a stablecoin for Canadians.” He said that the only options currently open were wire transfers, which “cost $45 and take 45 minutes of paperwork.” Rohani said that Interac e-Transfer, a Canadian funds transfer service, “remains the primary domestic P2P rail, operating through banks and credit unions.”Related: Stablecoins seen as ideal fit for real-time collateral managementCanada does have apps like PayPal and Wise, which support international P2P transfers, but those often come with high commissions and slow settlement times compared to stablecoins.Rohani said that while some crypto platforms allow for P2P transfers, they’re not widely used due to a lack of integration into mainstream financial services. Demand for more and different digital payment methods is growing in Canada, according to the 2024 digital payments report from Payments Canada, the owner and operator of Canada’s payment clearing and settlement infrastructure.But that demand may not translate directly into stablecoins. Crypto’s “journey towards financial integration among Canadians remains a distant prospect,” the report reads. Some 91% of Canadians have never used crypto as a payment. Ease of use and security were top priorities for international payment users. Source: Payments CanadaPayments Canada attributes the lack of interest to the assets being perceived as the “least secure payment method among Canadians compared to alternatives such as cash, credit cards, cheques, wire transfers and PayPal.”Even in the context of a central bank digital currency, which the crypto industry generally regards as a less favorable option to private, fiat-denominated stablecoins, interest just isn’t there. The survey found that 85% of respondents “did not envision themselves using a digital Canadian dollar and preferred their existing payment methods.”Is PM Carney pro-crypto?If more tailor-made regulations could integrate stablecoins with the mainstream payment options Canadians are comfortable with, it would still take a concerted effort from policymakers in Ottawa, where the Liberals have just won the federal elections.The crypto industry had cause for doubt. Liberal Prime Minister Mark Carney has previously expressed skepticism about cryptocurrency. In a speech as Governor of the Bank of England, he said they had failed as money. Still, he acknowledged stablecoins have a role to play in retail and wholesale payments. He said in 2021 that stablecoins should have access to central bank balance sheets — but only if strong protections were in place. “There’s been two systemic crises in money funds in little more than a decade [...] In baseball, it’s three strikes and you’re out. In cricket, it’s only the equivalent of one. For systemic payment systems, one is too many,” Carney stated.Kohani said, “With Mark Carney at the helm of the Liberal Party, we anticipate a pragmatic but regulation-first approach to crypto and stablecoins.”While his previous openness toward stablecoins suggests he’s open to the technology, he also “emphasizes the need for regulation, oversight and safeguards.”Another Liberal term, per Kohani, will likely mean the CSA continues to lead enforcement but could result in broader policy work, including a framework on stablecoins, “particularly if positioned as a tool for payments modernization and maintaining the relevance of the Canadian dollar.” Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/canada-lags-stablecoin-approach-room-to-catch-up?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound
