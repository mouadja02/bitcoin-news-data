Central Reserve Bank (BCR): Supervises crypto activities, enforces anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) standards, and registers Bitcoin service providers.

For Crypto Companies: Firms benefit from substantial tax exemptions, especially if revenue is generated outside El Salvador. However, compliance with AML, KYC, and reporting standards is mandatory. Reporting: Both individuals and companies must maintain records and report to CNAD and the Ministry of Finance as part of annual financial statements . Crypto License in El Salvador 2025 To obtain a crypto license in El Salvador, entities are required to appoint a compliance officer and cybersecurity personnel to review the AML/KYC compliance.

Crypto Adoption Rate in El Salvador Public adoption remains low, with user penetration at 3.34% in early 2025. The number of active users is expected to reach over 214,000 by year-end, but most Salvadorans do not use Bitcoin for daily transactions. The government is working on new initiatives to boost crypto utility and public perception.

These holdings are managed as part of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Fund. Crypto Mining in El Salvador El Salvador has promoted Bitcoin mining using geothermal energy from volcanoes, positioning itself as a pioneer in sustainable crypto mining. The state-owned geothermal company LaGeo operates mining facilities powered by 100% clean, emission-free volcanic energy, with a capacity of up to 95 MW5. In Q1 2025, Bitfinex Securities announced plans to launch the Blockstream Mining Note 2 (BMN2) in El Salvador, further expanding institutional mining activities in the country . The government continues to support mining as part of its broader digital assets strategy, leveraging renewable resources to attract global investment and innovation. Conclusion El Salvador’s approach to cryptocurrency in 2025 is defined by regulatory maturity and strategic adaptation. While Bitcoin is no longer mandatory as legal tender, the government maintains a crypto-friendly, tax-exempt environment and continues to invest in both Bitcoin holdings and sustainable mining initiatives. The regulatory focus has shifted to compliance, transparency, and international cooperation, positioning El Salvador as a unique hub for digital asset innovation in Latin America. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-28T13:45:10,"Crucial China-U.S. Trade Negotiations: Navigating the Path Forward","BitcoinWorld Crucial China-U.S. Trade Negotiations: Navigating the Path Forward The global economic stage is once again focused on a critical development: the official commencement of China-U.S. trade negotiations in Stockholm. This pivotal moment, confirmed by Solid Intel on X, marks a significant step in the ongoing economic dialogue between the world’s two largest economies. For anyone tracking market shifts, from traditional stocks to the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, these discussions carry immense weight. What’s at stake, and how might these talks reshape the economic landscape we navigate? Understanding the Stakes: What Are These China-U.S. Trade Negotiations All About? For years, the relationship between China and the United States has been defined by a complex interplay of cooperation and competition, particularly in the economic sphere. Trade disputes, tariffs, and intellectual property concerns have often cast a shadow over global markets. These latest China-U.S. trade negotiations in Stockholm represent an effort to address these long-standing issues, aiming to find common ground that can foster more stable and predictable trade relations. While specific agendas are often kept under wraps, historical context suggests several key areas are likely on the table: Tariff Reductions: Discussions around the removal or reduction of tariffs imposed during previous trade wars. Intellectual Property Rights: Strengthening protections for patents, copyrights, and trademarks to prevent infringement. Market Access: Addressing barriers that restrict foreign companies from fully operating in each other’s markets. State Subsidies: Concerns over government support for domestic industries that may create unfair competitive advantages. Supply Chain Resilience: Efforts to diversify and secure global supply chains, especially in critical sectors. The very act of sitting down for these talks, especially in a neutral venue like Stockholm, signals a willingness from both sides to engage in constructive dialogue. This is a crucial first step, but the path to resolution is often fraught with challenges. Why Do China-U.S. Trade Negotiations Matter for the Global Economy? The economic health of China and the United States is inextricably linked to the global economy. Any significant shift in their trade relationship sends ripples across continents, affecting everything from manufacturing costs to consumer prices. These China-U.S. trade negotiations are not just about two countries; they are about setting the tone for international commerce and geopolitical stability. Here’s why their outcome is so vital: Impact on Global Supply Chains Many industries rely heavily on intricate global supply chains that crisscross both China and the U.S. Disruptions or uncertainties stemming from trade tensions can lead to: Increased Costs: Tariffs and trade barriers can raise the price of imported goods and components. Production Delays: Companies may struggle to source necessary parts or materials, leading to manufacturing slowdowns. Diversification Efforts: Businesses might seek to move production out of one country, a costly and time-consuming process. Inflationary Pressures Trade policies can directly influence inflation. If tariffs remain high or new trade barriers emerge, the cost of goods for consumers can rise. Conversely, a successful negotiation leading to tariff reductions could help ease inflationary pressures globally. Investor Confidence and Market Volatility Uncertainty in trade relations often translates into market volatility. Investors tend to shy away from risk when there’s a lack of clarity on future trade policies. Positive developments in China-U.S. trade negotiations can boost confidence, leading to market rallies, while negative news can trigger sell-offs. This sentiment often spills over into various asset classes, including commodities and digital currencies. Navigating the Hurdles: Challenges and Opportunities in China-U.S. Trade Negotiations While the start of talks is positive, the road ahead for China-U.S. trade negotiations is rarely smooth. Both nations come to the table with deeply entrenched economic interests and national security concerns. The challenges are significant: Deep-Seated Issues: Moving beyond surface-level agreements to tackle fundamental disagreements on economic models and intellectual property. Geopolitical Context: Trade talks are often intertwined with broader geopolitical tensions, making pure economic solutions harder to achieve. Domestic Pressures: Leaders on both sides face domestic political pressures that can influence their negotiating positions. However, opportunities also abound. Successful negotiations could: Stabilize Global Markets: Reduce uncertainty and foster a more predictable environment for businesses and investors. Boost Economic Growth: Lower trade barriers can stimulate economic activity and foster innovation. Strengthen Bilateral Ties: Lay the groundwork for cooperation on other global challenges, such as climate change and public health. How Might These China-U.S. Trade Negotiations Impact Cryptocurrency Markets? The cryptocurrency market, known for its sensitivity to global macroeconomic shifts, is keenly watching these China-U.S. trade negotiations . While not directly tied to trade policies, the broader sentiment emanating from these talks can significantly influence crypto prices and investor behavior: Scenario Potential Crypto Market Impact Positive Breakthroughs (e.g., tariff reductions, clear path forward) Increased investor confidence in traditional markets could lead to a ‘risk-on’ environment, potentially boosting crypto. Bitcoin and other major altcoins might see upward momentum as liquidity flows into riskier assets. Protracted Standoff / Negative Outcomes (e.g., talks stall, new tariffs) Heightened market uncertainty and a ‘risk-off’ sentiment could lead to declines across asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Some might view Bitcoin as a safe haven, but overall market fear could dominate. Unchanged Status Quo (slow progress, minor agreements) Market reaction might be muted, with existing trends continuing. Crypto markets would likely react more to internal developments or other global news. Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are sometimes seen as an uncorrelated asset or a hedge against traditional financial instability. However, in an increasingly interconnected world, even digital assets cannot entirely escape the ripple effects of major geopolitical and economic events like these China-U.S. trade negotiations . Investors should remain vigilant, understanding that the macroeconomic environment plays a significant role in crypto’s trajectory. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for China-U.S. Trade Relations? The current round of China-U.S. trade negotiations in Stockholm is unlikely to be the final word on the complex trade relationship. It’s more probable that these talks are part of an ongoing process, setting the stage for future discussions and potentially laying the groundwork for more comprehensive agreements. The world will be watching closely for: Joint Statements: Any official announcements or communiqués from both sides regarding progress or future intentions. Follow-up Meetings: Whether these talks lead to further high-level engagements or working group sessions. Policy Shifts: Any changes in trade policies, tariffs, or regulatory frameworks implemented by either nation. The long-term goal for both economies is to establish a stable, predictable, and mutually beneficial trade framework. Achieving this would not only alleviate immediate economic pressures but also foster greater global stability, benefiting countless industries and individuals worldwide. The commitment to dialogue, even amidst disagreements, is a positive sign for the future of international economic relations. A Pivotal Dialogue for Global Stability The commencement of China-U.S. trade negotiations in Stockholm is more than just a diplomatic formality; it’s a critical juncture for the global economy. From the stability of supply chains to the confidence of investors and the trajectory of cryptocurrency markets, the outcomes of these discussions will resonate far and wide. While challenges remain, the willingness of both economic superpowers to engage in direct dialogue offers a glimmer of hope for a more predictable and prosperous future. Keeping an eye on these developments is essential for anyone navigating the complexities of today’s interconnected financial world.

2025-07-28T13:33:23,"Could Trump’s Latest Warnings to Russia and Iran Shake Bitcoin?","Donald Trump said earlier today that he will reduce the initial deadline for Russian President Vladimir Putin to reach a peace deal with Ukraine to just 10-12 days. Additionally, he hinted that the US might “wipe out” Iran fast if the Middle Eastern country restarts its nuclear program. With the rise of these geopolitical issues, the question now arises whether bitcoin’s uptrend is at risk. Recall that the POTUS set a 50-day ultimatum for Russia to conclude a peace deal with Ukraine on July 14, otherwise the largest nation by landmass will face “very severe tariffs.” Earlier today, reports emerged that Trump was disappointed by the lack of any progress being made on that front. Moreover, he threatened that there will be a new, shorter deadline for less than two weeks, which will be announced tomorrow. TRUMP ON RUSSIA: I’M GOING TO MAKE A NEW DEADLINE FOR ABOUT 10 OR 12 DAYS FROM TODAY TRUMP ON RUSSIA: WE JUST DON’T SEE ANY PROGRESS BEING MADE — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) July 28, 2025 Building on the geopolitical tension, Trump touched upon the sensitive Iranian topic as well, as the country has been “sending out nasty signals.” According to Walter Bloomberg’s post, Trump warned that if Iran restarts its nuclear program, the US will “wipe it out fast.” Bitcoin’s price has historically reacted negatively to Trump’s warnings and threats against other countries, especially if there’s a potential war involved. It tapped a new all-time high after the Iran-Israel conflict ended and now trades inches below it. However, its progress could stall or be halted as a whole if there’s further escalation on each front. From a technical standpoint, BTC was already rejected today at a crucial resistance at $120,000, which pushed it south to roughly $118,500 as of now, where it filled one of the CME gaps. #Bitcoin rejects at the crucial resistance, again.

2025-07-28T13:32:20,"Interactive Brokers open to launching its own crypto offerings","Interactive Brokers Group is considering creating its own digital token for customers, joining other big financial firms as U.S. regulators relax crypto rules. Founder of Interactive Brokers, Thomas Peterffy told Reuters that the company is evaluating methods to integrate stablecoins into its range of offerings. Although it hasn’t settled on a specific path, multiple options are under consideration for delivering these tokens directly to end users. As a major discount brokerage with a market capitalization of nearly $110 billion, the firm presently collaborates with Paxos for its crypto offerings and maintains a stake in the Zero Hash platform. Because of these partnerships, its clients currently have access to trading various cryptocurrencies via the platform. Peterffy added that the group is concentrating on facilitating 24/7, immediate top‑ups of brokerage accounts through stablecoins. Meanwhile, it is investigating smoother transfer mechanisms for widely held digital assets in and out of customer accounts. Among the proposals is permitting funding from stablecoins supplied by other established entities, contingent on those issuers satisfying specified criteria. Stablecoins represent digital units tied to underlying assets, often the U.S. dollar, and are intended to facilitate cross‑border value transfers outside conventional banking rails. However, detractors caution that these instruments can be misused by criminals to evade standard bank AML safeguards. ForecastEx expands Interactive Brokers’ innovation push Earlier in July, Robinhood launched a dollar‑backed token dubbed USDG as part of its Global Dollar Network alliance alongside firms like Kraken and Galaxy Digital. That move illustrates how fast the market for these tokens is growing. Along with stablecoins, the firm unveiled ForecastEx, a prediction‑market platform launched last year, enabling users to wager “yes” or “no” on diverse event outcomes. By the close of June, it reported roughly 3.87 million active accounts, marking a 32 % year‑over‑year increase. Elevated trading activity caused by tariff‑related market fluctuations has boosted the firm’s revenues. Since January, its stock has climbed approximately 47%, outpacing the S&P 500 Investment Banking & Brokerage index’s 20% gain in that interval. In a July 18 research update, Morningstar’s team said its prediction‑market and crypto moves offer a strategic counterbalance to potential volatility in its traditional equities, futures, and options sectors. IBKR founder stays cautious on crypto growth Peterffy has previously suggested allocating a modest 2–3% of one’s portfolio to Bitcoin, capping overall cryptocurrency exposure at 10%. He cautioned that although investors might benefit from some Bitcoin exposure, heavy concentrations expose holders to big price swings. He believed Bitcoin should stay outside the regular economy, even though Bitcoin futures have long been listed on the CME. After the tariff deal with the EU was confirmed, Bitcoin jumped above $120,000 for the first time in nearly two weeks. Just before that surge, it had been trading between $114,000 and $119,000. At $120,000, Bitcoin was only $3,080 away from its all‑time high. Peterffy’s recent comments underscore a cautious stance on rapid crypto expansion, but he hasn’t come to terms with the asset’s isolation from normal financial systems. “It’s basically hard to grasp its fundamental value. If we see people adopting it and ascribing a value to it, I’m okay with that, but I’m still not convinced,” he said.

2025-07-28T13:30:47,"Memecoins, NFTs Get Called Out By Their Own Architect: ‘Zero Intrinsic Value’","Solana Labs CEO Anatoly Yakovenko stirred up heat this week by calling memecoins and NFTs “digital slop” with no real value. He made the remark on X as part of a back‑and‑forth with Base creator Jesse Pollak. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s New Clock: How Wall Street Killed The Old Cycle, According To Expert Yakovenko compared these tokens to loot boxes in free‑to‑play mobile games. His blunt take has drawn both praise and criticism from across the crypto world. Memecoins Face Harsh Words Yakovenko said he’s held this view since at least January 2024. He argued that the price people pay is all that gives these tokens any worth. Pollak shot back, saying that the content itself—like a painting hanging in a museum—carries its own value, no matter what you charge to see it. The debate has put a spotlight on how far Solana’s growth relies on the very things its leader dismisses. I’ve said this for years. Memecoins and NFTs are digital slop and have no intrinsic value. Like a mobile game loot box. People spend $150b a year on mobile gaming. — toly 🇺🇸 (@aeyakovenko) July 27, 2025 Solana Revenue Tied To ‘Slop’ According to Solana‑focused infrastructure firm Syndica, memecoins made up 62% of the network’s decentralized app revenue in June. That figure helped push Solana’s take to about $1.6 billion in the first half of 2025. Big chunks of that money came from Pump.fun’s launchpad and PumpSwap’s DEX aggregator. Yet Yakovenko said Apple’s loot boxes drive revenue for the App Store in much the same way—profitable but seen by many as exploitative. the content itself is valuable. ads are a way to monetize that value. but the content itself is valuable. just like a painting is fundamentally valuable, regardless of whether you charge people at the museum to see it. — jesse.base.eth (@jessepollak) July 27, 2025 Community Pushback Builds Critics have been quick to call him out. X user “Caps,” who writes for Flaunch, accused Yakovenko of mocking his own user base. Another commentator, Karbon, said he finds this stance “distasteful,” pointing out that Yakovenko promotes memecoins all the time, even while claiming they’re worthless. The clash has fans and skeptics debating whether it’s fair to scorn a market that’s so clearly feeding Solana’s growth. Competition Heats Up Meanwhile, a rival memecoin launchpad called LetBonk has been eating into Pump.fun’s lead. At various points, LetBonk even topped Pump.fun in 24‑hour revenue.

2025-07-28T13:28:54,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Steady Around $118,000 As Fed Decision, Tech Earnings Loom","Bitcoin (BTC) steadied itself over the weekend while altcoins declined, entering a holding pattern ahead of the Fed decision on rate cuts, tech earnings, and crucial ETF data. The Fed is expected to announce its decision on interest rates, while tech earnings from major companies, including Microsoft and Amazon, could also impact market sentiment. ETF inflows have continued, but tariff tension could spark market volatility. Robert Kiyosaki Recommends Bitcoin ETFs For The Average Investor Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki has recommended spot Bitcoin ETFs for average investors. However, he called them inferior to the real asset, and urged sophisticated investors to hold real gold, silver, and Bitcoin (BTC) above ETFs. The author said ETFs were like “having a picture of a gun for personal defense,” emphasizing their limitations compared to Bitcoin . Kiyosaki stated, “I realize ETFs make investing easier for the average investor, so I do recommend ETFs for the average investor. Yet I extend these words of caution. For the average investor, I recommend: Gold ETFs, Silver ETFs, and Bitcoin ETFs. Yet an ETF is like having a picture of a gun for personal defense. Sometimes it’s best to have real gold, silver, Bitcoin, and a gun. Know the differences when it is best to have real and when it’s best to have paper. If you know the differences and how to use them… you’re better than average.” Kiyosaki’s position highlights his conviction that traditional savings methods fail during monetary debasement. The author had recently outlined his intention to buy “one more Bitcoin” after the asset crossed $120,000. However, he warned investors against excessive greed while explaining his decision to pause purchases until the economic situation becomes clearer. Bitcoin Will No Longer Expect Parabolic Rallies Or Plunging Bear Markets Blockware Bitcoin analyst Mitchell Askew believes Bitcoin’s (BTC) parabolic rallies and devastating bear markets are a thing of the past thanks to Bitcoin ETFs. According to Askew, spot Bitcoin ETFs have permanently reduced volatility and altered market dynamics. The analyst stated, “ BTC /USD looks like two entirely different assets before and after the ETF. The days of parabolic bull markets and devastating bear markets are over. BTC is going to $1 million over the next 10 years through a consistent oscillation between ‘pump’ and ‘consolidate.’ It will bore everyone to death along the way and shake the tourists out of their positions.” According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, reduced volatility has helped Bitcoin attract even bigger fish, giving it a fighting chance at mainstream adoption. However, the tradeoff is that there will likely be no more “God Candles.” Spot Bitcoin ETFs isolate capital into traditional investment vehicles that lack in-kind redemption and keep funds off-chain. This prevents the rotation of capital into altcoins, which is something investors have come to expect from previous market cycles. Net inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs crossed the $50 billion mark in July. However, the surge of capital into the asset has not translated into on-chain activity. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) faced substantial volatility last week, tumbling to an intraday low of $114,779 on Friday. However, it rebounded from this level to reclaim $118,000 and settle at $117,565. The recovery continued over the weekend as the price registered a marginal increase on Saturday and then rose 1.31% on Sunday to cross $119,000 and settle at $119,398. The flagship cryptocurrency enters a crucial week, with several macroeconomic factors influencing price action. BTC is expected to react to the Fed’s decision on interest rates, which will be announced on Wednesday. Economists expect the Fed to leave interest rates unchanged between 4.25% and 4.50%. While the Fed believes the economy is doing alright, it remains concerned about the impact of Trump’s tariffs on inflation. Inflation has steadily picked up in the past few months, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising from 2.4% in June to 2.7% in July. The second catalyst for the flagship cryptocurrency will be the second-quarter earnings. The Magnificent 7, including Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Nvidia (NVDA), and Meta Platforms (META), will publish their earnings this week. Over 50% of all companies listed in the S&P 500 will publish their earnings this month. Market watchers believe that earnings growth has been more resilient than expected, explaining why the S&P 500 has reached record levels. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs continue to register inflows, adding $72 million in inflows last week. While this has been the smallest weekly gain since June, Bitcoin ETFs continue to register strong investor interest. Buyers will be eying the $120,000 mark this week as they look to reclaim key levels. BTC’s uptick comes after reports that the US and China had agreed to delay the introduction of reciprocal trade tariffs. “JUST IN: China and the US have agreed to extend their pause on tariffs for another 90 days.” Analysts believe BTC must cross the $119,000-$120,000 levels for a big move to materialize. Crypto investor Ted Pillows stated in a post on X, “$ BTC needs to break above $119.5K for a big move. If that doesn't happen, this consolidation will continue. I think BTC could break above this level next month, which will start the next leg up.” Rekt Capital highlighted a slightly higher ceiling at around $120,000, stating. “Bitcoin has Daily Closed above the blue Range Low, kickstarting a break back into the very briefly lost Range. Any dips into the Range Low (confluent with the new Higher Low) would be a retest attempt to confirm the reclaim.” BTC traded in the red on Friday (July 18), dropping over 1% after reaching an intraday high of $120,800 and settling at $117,877. Sellers retained control over the weekend as the price registered a marginal decline on Saturday and fell 0.48% on Sunday to settle at $117,240. The price reached an intraday high of $119,603 on Monday. However, it could not stay at this level and fell to $117,402, ultimately registering a marginal increase. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as BTC rallied, rising over 2% to cross $119,000 and settling at $119,982. Source: TradingView Despite the positive sentiment, BTC lost momentum on Wednesday, dropping 0.99% to a low of $117,321 before settling at $118,794. Buyers retained control on Thursday as the price registered a marginal decline and settled at $118,381. Selling pressure intensified on Friday thanks to the sale of 80,000 BTC by a Satoshi-era whale. As a result, BTC plunged to an intraday low of $114,779. However, with the market pricing in the sale, the price recovered to reclaim $117,000, settling at $117,565, ultimately registering a 0.60% drop. BTC recovered over the weekend, registering a marginal increase on Saturday before rising 1.31% on Sunday to reclaim $119,000 and settle at $119,398. The current session sees BTC down 0.47%, trading around $118,820. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-07-28T13:22:51,"XRP Holders to See Biggest Airdrop – Here’s How To Claim","The post XRP Holders to See Biggest Airdrop – Here’s How To Claim appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP holders, be ready, for a big airdrop as it is coming soon. At Consensus 2025, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson revealed that 1.2 billion NIGHT tokens will go to XRP holders as part of the Midnight network’s massive airdrop. With over 37 million wallets eligible, this could become the biggest airdrop in crypto history. But how much will you get, and how can you claim it? One Snapshot, One Chance The snapshot for the airdrop was already taken on June 11 to see who qualifies. If your XRP wallet had at least $100 worth of tokens at that time, you’re in. This isn’t just about XRP, Cardano, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, BNB, AVAX, and BAT holders are all part of this massive event. But XRP holders stand out with a dedicated 5% share of the 24 billion NIGHT tokens. However, this isn’t just about free tokens. Hoskinson believes this wide-reaching airdrop is a step toward uniting the crypto community. Instead of competing in silos, different blockchains are being connected through shared ownership in Midnight, a new privacy-focused network that runs on both NIGHT and DUST tokens. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : GrabPay Now Accepts BTC ETH USDC and USDT in the Philippines , When and How to Claim The claim portal went live on July 15 and will remain open for 60 days, closing sometime in mid-September. Anyone who misses the window won’t be left out, they can still recover their tokens through a mining-based system called the Scavenger Mine. However, unclaimed tokens will eventually go to Midnight’s treasury after four years. How Much Will XRP Holders Get? Out of the 24 billion NIGHT tokens available, XRP holders will receive 5%, which is 1.2 billion tokens. The amount each person receives depends on how much XRP they had during the snapshot. Cardano holders will get the most (50%), Bitcoin holders will get 30%, and the rest will be shared by other supported tokens. Why This Airdrop Matters Hoskinson said this is the largest airdrop ever based on the number of wallets involved, over 37 million. His goal is to bring different crypto communities together instead of competing. Meanwhile, Ripple’s CTO, David Schwartz, also shared support, saying Midnight’s privacy tech is “very interesting.” It shows that XRP, often seen as a payments coin, can play a much bigger role in the growing Web3 space. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-28T13:21:29,"Why Vitalik Buterin Chose Transparency Over Anonymity in Building Ethereum","Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin explained in an episode of The Network State podcast why, unlike Satoshi Nakamoto, he did not create the blockchain platform anonymously. Buterin said the decision stemmed from the peculiarities of that time. Buterin was 19 when he started working on Ethereum in 2013. He admitted that he hadn't thought about anonymity, partly due to inexperience and eagerness. I was just a passionate developer with an idea and didn't think about hiding my identity, he explained. However, the main reason was the desire to make the platform open to everyone, including developers and investors. Publicity helped. It was easier for me because I could speak at conferences, convey the essence of Ethereum, and build trust. Anonymity could have prevented the community from gathering in the early stages, Buterin noted. He also highlighted the difference in context. When Satoshi Nakamoto launched Bitcoin in 2008, cryptocurrencies were new and risky, and the government's response was unclear. By 2013, the blockchain had become more understandable; the Ethereum founder said he was able to build the platform without worrying about potential risks. How can Ethereum be made even better? During the conversation, Buterin emphasized that the two main goals of the project remain scalability and utility, and a clear technical roadmap will help achieve them. Ethereum, broadly speaking, has two guiding stars. One is to be a widely used and scalable platform. The other is to remain truly valuable, meaning it's significantly more secure and decentralized than the systems that people would use instead, he said. According to the programmer, if the platform cannot process millions of transactions or becomes similar to traditional finance, it will lose its value. To scale, Ethereum is developing L1 and L2 solutions. At the first level, developers are implementing preliminary block confirmation, access lists, and decentralized data storage. At the second level, they are increasing the number of BLOB-objects, using PeerDAS and technologies such as ZK-SNARKs and STARKs for transaction proofs. These technologies enable processing millions of transactions per second while maintaining the security of the network. Buterin noted the limitations of Bitcoin's early ideas that Nakamoto did not fully consider: The main thing that I think Satoshi didn't fully understand was the asymmetry between creation and verification. In the network of the first cryptocurrency, creating and verifying blocks require equal effort. However, technologies like ZK-SNARKs and data sampling allow the builder nodes to do the main work, simplifying verification for others. This reduces the load and makes the network accessible to more users. An example of failure is the use of custodial wallets in the Lightning Network in El Salvador, which reduced decentralization. Buterin proposed a hub model: The solution is a hub model, where a small number of powerful nodes concentrate the work of generating proofs, while verification remains widely distributed. L2 rollups perform computations outside the main blockchain but prove them on L1, providing the same guarantees. Data sampling allows the chain to be verified by downloading only a portion of the information, increasing scalability without losing decentralization. We are committed to continuing to move forward, making Ethereum better, more accessible, more secure, and more useful for everyone, Buterin concluded.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/10217/why-vitalik-buterin-chose-transparency-over-anonymity-in-building-ethereum,"ETH|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|TRADING","News|Ethereum",cryptocompare

2025-07-28T13:05:05,"Mining Profitability Climbed Over 5% in June as Hashrate Fell, BTC Price Rose: Jefferies","Bitcoin (BTC) mining profitability increased 5.3% in June, buoyed by a 1.2% increase in the cryptocurrency's price and a 6.7% drop in the network hashrate, according to a report by investment bank Jefferies. The hashrate refers to the total combined computational power used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain, and is a proxy for competition in the industry and mining difficulty. It is measured in exahashes per second (EH/s). The profitability boost came as extreme summer heat across the U.S. drove up energy prices, prompting less efficient miners to throttle operations. So far in July, bitcoin has surged past $123,000, to set a new all-time high driven by increasingly favorable crypto regulation and a weakening U.S. dollar following tariff-related comments from President Donald Trump. The macro and regulatory backdrop has intensified investor interest and provided a fresh tailwind for mining firms, the report said. Despite the improved profitability, North American public miners saw a month-over-month decline in bitcoin production, analysts Jonathan Petersen and Jan Aygul wrote. In June, they mined a total of 3,382 BTC, down from 3,754 in May. They accounted for 25.1% of the global network, versus 26.3% the prior month, the report noted. MARA (MARA) led in output with 713 BTC mined, followed by CleanSpark with 685 tokens. MARA also maintained its lead in energized hashrate, posting 57.4 EH/s at the end of June, down slightly from May’s 58.3 EH/s. CLSK held the second-highest hashrate at 45.3 EH/s, the bank said. Bitcoin mining economics improved last month. A hypothetical 1 EH/s mining fleet would have generated approximately $57,000 in daily revenue during June, up from $54,000 in May, the report added.

2025-07-28T13:04:17,"Grab expands crypto payments in Philippines with Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT support","Grab, Southeast Asia’s largest ride-hailing and food delivery company, has extended its crypto payment feature to the Philippines, allowing users to top up their GrabPay wallets using Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), USD Coin (USDC), and Tether (USDT). The feature went live on 28 July, marking a significant expansion of the firm’s digital finance strategy and targeting one of the most crypto-active countries in the region. The crypto top-up service was first introduced in Singapore in 2024. Its extension into the Philippines reflects both market readiness and growing consumer appetite for digital currencies in daily use. The development also places Grab among the few mainstream platforms in the Asia-Pacific region currently integrating decentralised payment options into everyday services. Grab partners with Triple-A and PDAX for crypto rollout Grab is enabling this functionality through a collaboration with Singapore-based payment processor Triple-A, a registered digital payment token service provider. The firm previously helped Grab pilot the same top-up feature in Singapore, where the response reportedly exceeded expectations. Triple-A’s platform is integrated with crypto wallets and exchanges, allowing for seamless fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-fiat transactions. To facilitate local operations in the Philippines, Grab has partnered with the Philippine Digital Asset Exchange (PDAX), one of the country’s leading crypto trading platforms. PDAX’s involvement ensures compliance with local regulations and offers a familiar interface for local crypto users. With this move, Grab now sits at the intersection of fintech, mobility, and decentralised finance. Philippines among the global leaders in crypto adoption The Philippines continues to rank among the top countries for retail crypto adoption, driven by remittances, mobile-first internet penetration, and limited access to traditional banking. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) has also provided a regulatory framework for virtual asset service providers (VASPs), which has encouraged domestic fintech development and consumer engagement. According to data from Triple-A, over 11.6 million Filipinos owned cryptocurrencies in 2024, accounting for more than 10% of the country’s adult population. The country also ranks third globally in terms of play-to-earn adoption and decentralised finance usage. The latest integration with Grab further enhances crypto utility across transportation, food delivery, and financial services. Broader shift in Southeast Asia toward digital assets The expansion of crypto payments into the Philippines is part of a broader regional trend. Companies like Grab are tapping into Southeast Asia’s fast-growing digital economy. With a young, mobile-first population, the region has emerged as a fertile ground for crypto-based solutions—especially where traditional banking infrastructure is limited. Triple-A’s ongoing partnership with Grab could see further rollouts across other Southeast Asian markets such as Indonesia, Vietnam, and Malaysia. As central banks in the region explore digital currencies and clearer regulatory standards, mainstream apps offering crypto-based payment options may become more prevalent. Grab’s adoption of digital currencies for wallet top-ups reflects a larger shift towards embedding crypto in consumer ecosystems, not as an investment, but as a daily transaction tool.

2025-07-28T13:03:41,"Bitcoin to peak at $155,000 on this date, according expert","As Bitcoin ( BTC ) flirts with reclaiming the $120,000 mark, a trading expert has suggested the asset has more momentum left, potentially propelling it to a record high of $155,000. This outlook is supported by insights from Bitcoin’s weekly chart, which point to a strong rally that began after BTC rebounded from the 50-week Moving Average ( MA ) on April 7, 2025, according to analysis by TradingShot in a TradingView post published July 28. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView The rebound occurred within a broader three-year ascending channel that began in November 2022. Notably, this was the second time Bitcoin found support at the 0.236 Fibonacci level within this structure, an area historically tied to major bullish reversals. The current setup also mirrors earlier price movements. In late 2022 and again in early 2023, Bitcoin surged approximately 106.37% following similar technical signals. A more aggressive rally between late 2023 and early 2024 resulted in a 197.23% gain. TradingShot now suggests that the current expansion phase echoes that stronger move, implying a potential peak near $155,500 in the coming months. This would represent an upside of about 30% from current levels. BTC facing resistance In a July 28 X post , cryptocurrency trading expert Michaël van de Poppe noted that Bitcoin has once again stalled at a key resistance zone around $119,400, facing rejection after a brief push higher in the short term. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView The failure to break above this level has raised the likelihood of a short-term pullback, particularly with a CME futures gap still open around $118,500. Additionally, the price action has created a liquidity cluster below, increasing the probability of a downward sweep before any continuation. Therefore, a correction into the $116,500 and $117,500 range could present a strong accumulation opportunity. Bitcoin price analysis At the time of reporting, Bitcoin was trading at $118,961, representing a 0.7% increase over the last 24 hours. On the weekly chart, it has posted a modest 0.68% gain.

Source: Finbold Currently, Bitcoin appears poised to sustain its momentum, trading well above its 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of $110,835 and its 200-day SMA of $90,530, both confirming a strong uptrend. Meanwhile, the 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) sits at 64.11, indicating solid buying momentum without entering overbought territory, suggesting room for further gains.

Matrixport: Bitcoin Reaches $116,000 Target, But Late Summer Correction May Be Coming While emphasizing that market sentiment is becoming increasingly positive, the company highlighted three important developments that could increase volatility in financial markets this week: Financial results announcements concentrated on US stocks, The White House's digital assets report was postponed, Interest rate decision of the US Federal Reserve (FED). Matrixport notes that these factors could trigger a new wave of volatility in the market. The report also noted that Bitcoin has entered a period of seasonal weakness. Data from the past decade has shown that August and September are among the weakest-performing months for Bitcoin. It's reported that the average return, particularly in August, is close to zero, with only three years of positive returns. Consequently, many investors are reportedly reducing their positions during this period, taking profits.

2025-07-28T13:00:54,"Legendary Trader Peter Brandt Says One XRP Rival Could Become a ‘Rock Star,’ Unveils Massive Price Target for Silver","Veteran trader Peter Brandt says that one payments-focused crypto asset will outshine the pack while predicting a massive upswing for silver. Brandt tells his 803,900 followers on the social media platform X that while most cryptocurrencies will eventually go to zero, one token he envisions becoming a “rock star” is the XRP ( XRP) rival Stellar ( XLM ). “Every crypto nerd has his/her/its own pet rock or Beanie Baby. I believe 95%+ of the 11,000 actively traded coins will become near worthless – your pet rock included. Already 3.7 million coins are dead (source: CoinGecko). Only about 50% of most actively traded cryptos are trading at greater than 10% of their peak value. One coin I think could become a rock star is XLM.” Source: Peter Brandt/X Looking at Brandt’s chart, he seems to suggest that XLM is gearing up to break out from a massive triangle pattern on the monthly chart. The chart also appears to suggest that Brandt is targeting $1.51 for XLM. XLM is trading for $0.452 at time of writing, a fractional decrease on the day. Moving on to silver (XAG), Brandt says the commodity could reach a staggering price – nearly twice its all-time high set in 1980 – if it can break through its current resistance level. “This is my long-term silver chart. While not technically a cup and handle, the chart nevertheless could support an advance to $95 per ounce if overhead resistance is hurdled. True for paper silver as well as physical silver.” Source: Peter Brandt/X According to Brandt, Silver needs to reach $100 per ounce just to keep pace with the growth of other assets. “For the record, I am long Silver. I am not a silver hater. The last big call I made on silver was to alert the world that [the] price was topping out at $50 an ounce back in 2011. Wow, in the last 14 years, silver’s been quite a performer. Silver needs to go to $100 an ounce just to catch up with the rest of the world.” Silver is valued at $38.42 per ounce at time of writing.

2025-07-28T13:00:00,"Bitcoin Rally Builds Amid US-China Tariff Pause","For now, analysts are divided on whether Bitcoin can sustain this rebound, with some pointing to $119.5K as a crucial breakout level and others expecting a retest of lower support near $114.5K. Meanwhile, Japanese firm Metaplanet doubled down on its Bitcoin strategy by purchasing an additional 780 BTC for $92 million, bringing its total to 17,132 BTC. The company’s aggressive BTC accumulation fueled a 246% year-to-date surge in its stock price, making it Japan’s top-performing stock with plans to expand into digital banking. Bitcoin Gains Ground Bitcoin surged past $119,000 on Sunday, staging an impressive rebound from two-week lows close to $114,500. The move reignited bullish momentum and started fresh discussions among traders about whether BTC could soon break above key resistance levels. BTC price action over the past 7 days (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Charts show BTC/USD approaching a critical reclaim area, with bulls trying to close the day above the 10-day simple moving average. This recovery came despite recent bearish pressure after one of the largest-ever Bitcoin sales, and coincided with news that the US and China agreed to postpone the implementation of new trade tariffs, which may have eased broader market tension. Crypto investor Ted Pillows commented that Bitcoin needs to decisively clear $119.5K for a breakout, and added that if it fails to do so, current consolidation could persist. He is optimistic that BTC might achieve this breakout next month, initiating the next leg higher. Popular analyst Rekt Capital pointed out that Bitcoin successfully closed above the lower boundary of its recent range, suggesting that the asset could be reentering a previously lost trading zone. He warned, however, that any pullbacks into that range low could serve as critical retests to confirm the move. Not all analysts are convinced the uptrend will hold without further tests to the downside. Trader CrypNuevo identified a potential mid-term target in the $114.5K–$113.6K range, which aligns with a concentration of order-book liquidity and prior liquidation zones. From this perspective, a revisit to lower support levels is still very much on the table. According to CoinGlass data , the current “max pain” point for short positions lies around $119,650. If BTC were to push back toward its all-time highs near $123,000, the resulting short liquidations could surpass $1.1 billion. Coinank's own liquidity models also indicate strong resistance between $119,000 and $120,000 due to dense liquidation clusters at those levels. Adding to the volatility picture, analyst TheKingfisher warned that short-term price swings may become more pronounced. His gamma exposure analysis showed dealers heavily short gamma, a condition that tends to increase market turbulence as they hedge their positions. This dynamic suggests that traders should brace for amplified volatility in the immediate future. Metaplanet Buys More BTC Some companies are not too worried about whether BTC’s price will go up or down next. In fact, Japanese investment firm Metaplanet acquired an additional 780 Bitcoin, bringing its total holdings to 17,132 BTC. The company revealed the purchase on Monday, and shared that it paid an average of approximately $118,145 per Bitcoin—just under the current trading price of $118,656. The total cost of the latest buy was about $92 million, and in total, Metaplanet invested roughly $1.7 billion in Bitcoin, with an average acquisition cost of $99,640 per coin. This strategic move places Metaplanet seventh on the list of top Bitcoin corporate treasuries worldwide. It sits just behind Trump Media & Technology Group, which holds 18,430 BTC, and ahead of Galaxy Digital Holdings, led by Michael Novogratz, which owns 12,830 BTC. While Metaplanet’s holdings are impressive, they still fall far short of Strategy, the global leader with over 607,770 BTC, valued at more than $72 billion. Top Bitcoin treasury companies (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET ) Metaplanet made it clear that its Bitcoin purchases are part of a broader vision. Reports suggest the company plans to eventually leverage its digital assets to acquire cash-generating businesses, potentially including a digital bank in Japan. This approach reflects a tailored strategy, which CEO Simon Gerovich described in a recent Forbes Japan interview as “Japan-native,” designed to align with local regulatory and tax frameworks. He also explained that the company’s model enables Bitcoin exposure through tax-free savings accounts, making it more accessible to Japanese investors. Metaplanet’s YTD stock price (Source: Google Finance ) The bold Bitcoin-focused strategy has paid off handsomely for Metaplanet’s shareholders. The company’s stock has soared 517% over the past year and 246% year-to-date, trading at $8.36 as of Monday. Gerovich acknowledged the unexpected pace of growth, and said that Metaplanet became Japan’s top-performing stock with record trading volume and a market cap of more than ¥1 trillion.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/10215/bitcoin-rally-builds-amid-us-china-tariff-pause,"BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|ASIA|MARKET","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
