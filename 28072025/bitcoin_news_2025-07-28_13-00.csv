2025-07-28T10:58:43,"Crypto Scammers Waste 4K Hours & China Makes $12M Crypto Bust: Best Wallet Protects You","Scammers will always find a way, especially in crypto, where regulation is often lacking and enforcement feels like a distant dream. So, how do you fight back? Simple. Beat them at their own game, waste their time, and watch them squirm. Kitboga Strikes Back A pseudonymous streamer known as Kitboga designed an effective and satisfying new weapon in the fight against crypto fraud: a fake Bitcoin ATM ‘maze.’ A popular tool for crypto scammers is to have victims deposit cash into a Bitcoin ATM; the machine will then produce the destination wallet address and transaction ID. Once the scammers have the newly converted Bitcoin, they can ignore the victim and move on. Bitcoin ATMs are surprisingly accessible – there are over 40K worldwide – and so are an easy tool for scammers to use. Kitboga has weaponized the ATM part of the scam and turned it against would-be scammers. He crafted a digital ‘maze’—a nightmare of customer service loops, endless hold queues, CAPTCHA, and AI-powered confusion. It’s like an evil bureaucrat’s dream: a twisted journey through digital hell, with a fake Bitcoin waiting at the end. Kitboga’s trap has wasted over 4,000 hours of scammers’ time. What started as comedic content has transformed into a real-time weapon against scams, gathering intel and frustrating fraudsters at every turn. Engineering the Maze When scammers demand victims deposit cash at Bitcoin ATMs, Kitboga counters with a Photoshopped receipt: a QR code linking to a fictional exchange and a hotline that leads victims (or, in this case, scammers) into a purpose‑built labyrinth. Once inside, attackers must solve tedious tasks in the guise of CAPTCHA or human verification: estimate the number of nuts in a bucket, gauge wave heights, or even play Derude’s ‘Sandstorm’ on a keyboard (as an added bonus, each attempt causes the CAPTCHA to speed up). Enter the wallet address incorrectly – and of course, it’s a fake, so it will automatically be incorrect – and Kitboga’s system triggers automated phone interactions where an AI will intentionally mishear digits, repeat prompt failures, and eventually trap the scammer in prolonged hold periods. Over the past year, the fake ATM has trapped about 500 scammers, occupying them for 3,953 hours, approximately 164 days. On average, each scammer spends nearly 3 hours in the maze, while the record stands at 156 hours; that’s more than six days. Six days in which the scammer wasn’t scamming someone else. More Than a Time Waster Kitboga isn’t merely playing games with scammers; he’s gathering actionable intelligence. Registering on the fake crypto exchange Kitboga set up requires scammers to enter their Bitcoin address, giving the team a growing database of known scam wallets. Some attackers inadvertently reveal video feeds or other identifiers. In collaboration with Kraken, crypto funds obtained by scammers have reportedly been frozen based on information from the maze. The fake ATM maze is Kitboga’s ‘second most effective tool,’ behind AI‑powered autodialers. His team is launching similar infinite‑maze tactics for other scam types, including gift card fraud and mailed‑cash schemes. Bitcoin ATM scams are nothing new—but their scale is increasing. In the first half of 2024, U.S. consumers lost nearly $65M to scams routed through ATMs; 2023 saw over $100M lost in crypto ATM scams. But like normal people, for fraudsters, time is money. Every minute spent in Kitboga’s maze is not spent scamming real victims – the maze even requires scammers on hold to respond with ridiculous phrases or risk losing their spot. Scambaiting isn’t the only tool in the arsenal – other entities, like Chinese law enforcement, are turning to different tools. Chinese Local Law Enforcement Step Up Beijing’s Haidian District People’s Procuratorate exposed an embezzlement-driven crypto laundering operation involving Kuaishou employees. The employees siphoned approximately ¥140M ($20M) via Bitcoin and mixers routed through at least eight overseas exchanges. Authorities recovered 92 BTC (¥89M, $11.7M) and successfully prosecuted eight insiders, issuing prison terms ranging from 3 to 14 years alongside financial penalties. China has some of the strictest anti-crypto policies in the world. That makes the potential gains from crypto scams even greater, though it elevates the risk. A prosecutor noted the case exhibits all the traits of modern digital-era corruption: Small-scale officials engaging in big fraud Crypto-aided money laundering Poor risk control within corporations Though China has banned crypto trading and mining, underground operations remain vibrant. Earlier investigations uncovered a $2.2B money laundering ring using OTC brokers, secret shell companies, and exchanges, often used to bypass China’s strict foreign exchange caps. In the end, what brought down the latest crypto scamming ring was dedicated local law enforcement, illustrating that the path forward to fight scams involves boots-on-the-ground in more than one way. The fight also requires increasing everyday crypto literacy – and that means a top-of-the-line crypto wallet.

2025-07-28T10:57:30,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Correction Over? Here’s What Signals a New ATH","Bitcoin recently flushed a key liquidity zone below the $116K mark, triggering a period of sideways consolidation. With the FOMC meeting scheduled for Wednesday, traders are bracing for a potentially significant price move driven by macroeconomic developments. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart Bitcoin remains within a steep ascending price channel, recently triggering a sweep of significant sell-side liquidity just below the $116K level. This area was loaded with stop-losses and long liquidations, which were flushed as the market dipped. Despite a short-term rebound following the sweep, bullish momentum has yet to regain full strength, likely due to a spike in supply pressure following a historic whale transaction, where one of the oldest known wallets moved dormant BTC after years of inactivity. Currently, Bitcoin is consolidating between the ascending channel’s support at $114K and the ATH resistance around $123K. This range-bound behavior reflects market hesitation ahead of the FOMC meeting scheduled for Wednesday, which is expected to trigger a major volatility event based on the Fed’s rate policy decision. The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, BTC’s corrective drop was absorbed near the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement zone around $115K, prompting a reversal. Moreover, the price action has broken above a bullish flag formation, signaling a potential continuation toward $123K if momentum sustains. However, this bullish setup is contingent upon upcoming macro developments. All eyes are now on Wednesday’s FOMC meeting, with traders awaiting confirmation of a rate cut or hawkish tone. Depending on the Fed’s stance, Bitcoin could either break above its ATH or revisit lower support zones. On-chain Analysis By ShayanMarkets As Bitcoin continues to trade sideways without a decisive breakout, the behavior of large holders is raising eyebrows across the market. On July 25th, a notable spike in Binance Whale Inflows was recorded, with over $1.2 billion in cumulative BTC entering the exchange in a single day. This surge marks the largest 30-day inflow observed in recent months, signaling a major shift in market dynamics. This wave of inflows led to immediate short-term selling pressure, pushing Bitcoin down from the $120K resistance to the $115K–$116K support zone, where it currently consolidates. While retail inflows have been gradually rising, they pale in comparison to this whale activity, highlighting a significant imbalance in market supply. If buyers fail to absorb this wave of supply, further downside toward $110K becomes a likely scenario. However, should Bitcoin rebound from current support, a retest of $121K and potentially new all-time highs remain on the table. The post Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Correction Over?

2025-07-28T10:52:50,"MSTY: A High-Risk, High-Reward Bet On Bitcoin","Summary The YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF offers high-yield exposure to Strategy and Bitcoin via a synthetic long position and a covered call strategy. The ETF is best suited for investors with a bullish Bitcoin outlook and a very high-risk tolerance, given its leveraged and derivative-based structure. Bitcoin recently reached an all-time high just below $123k as pro-crypto regulation -- the GENIUS Act -- changed investor sentiment for the better. MSTY has delivered strong NAV returns since inception, but income distributions are volatile and upside is capped due to the covered call approach. While recent pro-crypto regulation and Bitcoin price surges are positives, MSTY is only appropriate for those willing to accept significant risk and potential underperformance if the crypto market corrects. The YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF ( MSTY ) is a potentially attractive investment product for investors that have a favorable view on cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), and that want to monetize a synthetic long position in Bitcoin investor Strategy ( MSTR ). Strategy is the biggest corporate owner of Bitcoin in the world and with the cryptocurrency market recently receiving favorable stimulus from the GENIUS Act, the Bitcoin price has reached new all-time highs. A yield-oriented position in the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF could make sense for investors that understand the risks of an investment in MSTY and that have a very high tolerance when it comes to taking risk in their portfolios. Data by YCharts Previous Rating I have no previous coverage on the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF, but up-graded Strategy to hold in my last work in June: Bitcoin Recovery Creates Less Risk . At the time of my last coverage, Strategy owned more than 580,000 Bitcoins which was equal to about 3% of the outstanding Bitcoin supply. Further, cryptocurrencies made a big comeback lately on the back of favorable stablecoin regulation -- the GENIUS Act -- which creates the first regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers. This move has sparked optimism in the cryptocurrency market, causing Bitcoin to grapple with a price of ~$123,000 for the first time ever. Strong NAV Upside And High-Income Potential The YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF is a way for investors to turn a favorable view on Strategy into a high-yielding income plan. Since Strategy is basically a Bitcoin investor (although it has a software business as well), the company has been a primary vehicle for investors to get Bitcoin exposure. Fundamentally, Strategy itself is a leveraged way to invest in Bitcoin as the company is issuing both equity and debt (mostly 0% convertible senior notes) in order to finance Bitcoin purchases. As a result, Strategy has out-performed Bitcoin by a massive margin in recent years. Data by YCharts This YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF does not own shares of Strategy, however, but rather builds a synthetic long position through the use of derivatives. In addition to the synthetic position in Strategy, the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF sells covered calls in order to generate recurring dividend income for investors. The YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF therefore allows investors to monetize a long position in Strategy through option income, but it is a high-yielding ETF that is likely only suitable to very high risk-takers. There are two sources of potential gains for investors that buy into MSTY: 1) A high annualized distribution yield that is currently standing at 132.5%, and 2) Potential NAV gains. The majority of the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF's are going to come from distributions... which are made monthly. In the trailing-twelve-month period, the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF made $27.59 in cumulative distributions. The monthly distribution has fluctuated widely, however, so investors that depend on predictable income would likely not want to own this ultra-high-yield investment product. Data by YCharts Favorable stablecoin legislation recently catapulted the Bitcoin price to an all-time high just short of $123,000 and changed sentiment towards many other digital currencies as well. Stablecoins are a critical pillar of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, allowing investors to (relatively) safely park capital and move into and out of digital currencies easily and without high costs. The stablecoin market, which is a part of the broader cryptocurrency market, has boomed in recent years as well. I dove into more detail about the GENIUS Act legitimizing stablecoins and their impact on the cryptocurrency market in my work on Circle Internet Group ( CRCL ). CNBC Strong Net Asset Value Returns Driven By Bitcoin Price Recovery In terms of net asset value returns, the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF has achieved very respectable returns since inception: its net asset value has soared 336.6% since February 2024. While the ETF has a very limited return history so far, the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF has done quite well, due largely to a massive recovery in the underlying Bitcoin price in the last year. YieldMax Strong Bitcoin-Related Upside Potential The YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF has an impressive total return since inception, but the ETF’s net asset value potential will be directly tied to the performance of the world’s biggest digital asset Bitcoin. If the Bitcoin price were to slump going forward, investors could see serious net asset value erosion for the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF. So far, shares of Strategy have out-performed the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF and will likely continue to do so (I will explain in the risk section why). Data by YCharts Risks With MSTY The YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF sells covered calls, which can be risky if Strategy’s share price rises above the strike price of such calls (which means the option buyer will exercise the option and the option seller will have to sell shares at the lower strike price). This is the reason why high-yielding ETFs running covered call strategies may actually end up underperforming the underlying asset. In other words, the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF offers investors a high-yield of more than 130% that comes at the price of capped upside. Therefore, the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF would likely only be a good investment product for investors that want to translate a favorable Strategy/Bitcoin outlook into high current income today. Final Thoughts The YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF is a potentially attractive investment for investors that have a positive long-term view on cryptocurrencies in general, especially in the context of recent efforts to provide a regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers. It is also chiefly aimed at investors that want to generate a high monthly distribution from a synthetic long position in Strategy. Further, the GENIUS Act is a milestone legislation package that legitimizes investments in digital assets and that could provide a boost to the development of the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. The YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF, however, is only a decent investment production for investors that understand the high risk of MSTY (especially with regards to its capped upside potential). Investors that like Strategy may want to own shares outright in order to fully participate in the Bitcoin investor's upside.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4805049-msty-a-high-risk-high-reward-bet-on-bitcoin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|MARKET|REGULATION","BTC-USD|MSTR|MSTY",cryptocompare

The latest addition pushes its total holdings to 17,132 BTC, which is worth more than $2 billion. Metaplanet Adds 780 BTC In an update shared by Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich, the company disclosed a remarkable year-to-date (YTD) Bitcoin yield of 449.7% for 2025. The latest development came less than a month ago, when it purchased 797 BTC. This buying spree aligns with the Tokyo-listed firm’s revised “555 Million Plan,” which replaced its previous 21,000 BTC target for 2026. Under the new roadmap, the firm aims to hit 100,000 BTC by the end of this year and scale up to 210,000 BTC by 2027. It was in April 2024 that Metaplanet first embraced its Bitcoin accumulation strategy. Since then, the company has aggressively scooped up the digital asset, earning the moniker “Japanese MicroStrategy.” Metaplanet’s Bitcoin-focused strategy paid off in the second quarter as revenue reached 1.1 billion yen (which is around $7.6 million. This represents a 42.4% year-over-year jump, according to its latest quarterly report released earlier this month. Just as Metaplanet ramps up its Bitcoin reserves, SharpLink Gaming is gaining momentum in the Ethereum market. SharpLink Acquires 77,210 ETH The Nasdaq-listed firm has made a fresh purchase of 77,210 ETH, estimated to be around $295 million. In its latest update, Lookonchain revealed that the move brings the total Ether holdings of the company to over 438,000 ETH, worth more than $1.7 billion, which positions SharpLink as the second-largest corporate holder of ETH after Bitmine Immersion Tech. Interestingly, most of the newly acquired ETH has already been staked. The aggressive expansion comes on the heels of a leadership shakeup, as former BlackRock executive Joseph Chalom stepped in as co-CEO. Data from Yahoo Finance reported that Sharplink closed at $21.99 on July 25, with a 5.7% decline for the day. The stock shed $1.33 during regular trading hours. Despite the drop, the stock showed strong signs of recovery in pre-market trading, as it rose to $23.53, a 7% increase from the previous close.

2025-07-28T10:40:11,"Sequans’ Bold Bitcoin Acquisition: A $88.5M Move Boosting Holdings to 3,072 BTC","BitcoinWorld Sequans’ Bold Bitcoin Acquisition: A $88.5M Move Boosting Holdings to 3,072 BTC In a significant development that underscores the growing interest of publicly traded companies in digital assets, Sequans Communications, a Nasdaq-listed IoT semiconductor and module developer, has made headlines with its latest Sequans Bitcoin acquisition . This strategic move sees the company substantially increase its Bitcoin holdings, signaling a robust commitment to integrating cryptocurrency into its treasury management strategy. But what does this mean for Sequans, and for the broader corporate adoption of Bitcoin? The Latest Chapter in Sequans’ Strategic Bitcoin Acquisition Sequans Communications recently announced a major expansion of its Bitcoin reserves, acquiring an additional 755 BTC for a hefty $88.5 million. This purchase, as detailed in a Newsfile press release, was executed at an average price of $117,296 per Bitcoin. This latest transaction brings Sequans’ total Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 3,072 BTC as of July 25. The funding for this substantial purchase was sourced from the proceeds of a $380 million convertible note offering, highlighting a deliberate financial strategy to bolster the company’s digital asset portfolio. This isn’t just a one-off event; it’s part of a calculated approach. For a company primarily focused on IoT technology, this significant investment in Bitcoin raises interesting questions about future corporate finance trends. It suggests a growing confidence in Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a viable component of a corporate balance sheet. Why Are Companies Like Sequans Making a Bitcoin Acquisition? The decision by a tech company like Sequans to make such a substantial Sequans Bitcoin acquisition is multifaceted. Several factors typically drive companies to incorporate Bitcoin into their treasury strategies: Inflation Hedge: In an economic climate marked by inflation concerns, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a potential hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Its decentralized nature and fixed supply make it an attractive alternative to traditional assets. Store of Value: Many proponents believe Bitcoin serves as a digital store of value, akin to digital gold. Companies may hold Bitcoin to preserve purchasing power over the long term. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury can provide diversification away from traditional assets like cash and bonds, potentially enhancing overall portfolio resilience. Future-Proofing: As the digital economy evolves, holding digital assets like Bitcoin can be seen as a forward-thinking strategy, positioning the company at the forefront of financial innovation. Investor Appeal: For some companies, holding Bitcoin can also appeal to a new segment of investors who are bullish on cryptocurrencies and the broader digital asset space. Decoding the Numbers: What Does $117,296 Per Bitcoin Imply? The average purchase price of $117,296 per Bitcoin is a crucial detail. This figure provides insight into the market conditions during which Sequans made its acquisition. It reflects a specific valuation point and underscores the company’s willingness to invest heavily even at what might be considered a premium price by some. This level of investment indicates a strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition, despite its notorious price volatility. To put this into perspective, here’s a simplified look at the company’s holdings: Metric Details Latest Purchase (BTC) 755 BTC Latest Purchase (USD) $88.5 million Average Price Per BTC (Latest) $117,296 Total BTC Holdings (as of July 25) 3,072 BTC Funding Source $380 million convertible note offering This significant outlay highlights the scale of conviction Sequans holds regarding Bitcoin’s role in its financial future. The decision to use proceeds from a convertible note offering further emphasizes a strategic, rather than speculative, approach to this Sequans Bitcoin acquisition . Navigating the Challenges: Risks of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings While the benefits of a Sequans Bitcoin acquisition can be compelling, it’s also important to acknowledge the inherent challenges and risks involved in holding a volatile asset like Bitcoin on a corporate balance sheet: Price Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its dramatic price swings, which can significantly impact a company’s financial statements. Large unrealized gains or losses can affect investor perception and financial reporting. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Changes in regulations could impact the legality, taxation, or liquidity of Bitcoin holdings. Security Risks: Storing large amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security measures to prevent hacks, theft, or loss of private keys. Companies must invest heavily in secure custody solutions. Accounting Complexity: Accounting for Bitcoin can be complex, as different jurisdictions may have varying rules for how digital assets are treated for tax and reporting purposes. Public Perception: While some investors may applaud such a move, others might view it as too risky or outside the company’s core business, potentially impacting stock performance. Sequans, like other corporate Bitcoin holders, must carefully manage these risks to ensure the long-term viability and positive impact of its digital asset strategy. A Growing Trend? Sequans Joins a Distinguished List Sequans is not alone in its bold move. Its substantial Sequans Bitcoin acquisition places it among a growing list of publicly traded companies that have chosen to allocate a portion of their treasury to Bitcoin. Pioneers like MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, have aggressively accumulated Bitcoin, advocating for its role as a superior treasury reserve asset. Other notable companies include Tesla, which briefly held significant Bitcoin before selling a portion, and various smaller firms. This trend suggests a paradigm shift in how corporate finance departments view non-traditional assets, moving beyond just cash and short-term investments. The increasing number of companies adopting Bitcoin as a treasury asset lends credibility to the cryptocurrency and indicates a broader acceptance within mainstream finance. This collective movement could pave the way for more widespread institutional adoption in the future. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for Sequans and Corporate Crypto? The implications of Sequans’ expanded Bitcoin holdings are significant. For Sequans itself, this move could be seen as a strategic differentiator, potentially attracting investors interested in companies with exposure to digital assets. It also positions the company as a forward-thinking entity in the tech sector, willing to embrace new financial frontiers. More broadly, this Sequans Bitcoin acquisition adds another data point to the narrative of corporate Bitcoin adoption. As more companies follow suit, the demand for Bitcoin could increase, potentially influencing its market dynamics. Furthermore, it might spur innovation in financial services tailored for corporate crypto treasuries, including custody solutions, accounting frameworks, and risk management tools. The journey of corporate Bitcoin adoption is still in its early stages, but each major acquisition by a public company like Sequans helps to normalize and validate this emerging trend. It will be interesting to observe how this strategy impacts Sequans’ financial performance and market standing in the coming years, and whether it encourages other IoT or tech companies to consider similar investments. Conclusion: Sequans’ Bold Leap into the Future of Finance Sequans Communications’ latest Sequans Bitcoin acquisition is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a statement. By significantly increasing its Bitcoin holdings to 3,072 BTC with an $88.5 million purchase, Sequans is firmly planting its flag in the evolving landscape of digital finance. This move reflects a strategic decision to leverage Bitcoin’s potential as a long-term store of value and a hedge against economic uncertainties, funded by a substantial convertible note offering. While challenges such as volatility and regulatory ambiguity persist, Sequans joins a growing cohort of public companies embracing Bitcoin, signaling a potential shift in corporate treasury management. This bold step by an IoT semiconductor developer highlights the increasing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies and sets an intriguing precedent for future corporate strategies in the digital age.

On the Downside… Though the initiative is exciting, it comes with a few strings. The crypto redemption value is relatively small, asset management is the user’s responsibility, and taxes may apply if the redeemed crypto appreciates. Also, the rules around how frequently points can be converted are still unclear, meaning the long-term appeal will depend on how the program evolves. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In a new thread on the social media platform X, the crypto analytics platform Altcoin Vector says that leverage risk is building within the second-largest digital asset by market cap despite ETH’s most recent price rise being backed by the spot market and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). “ETH Futures OI (open interest) just hit a new ATH (all-time high) – double since May – and price is climbing with it. Unlike late 2024, this rise is backed by ETF inflows and spot momentum, but… OI at historic levels is a double-edged sword. Conviction is back, but leverage risk is building.” Source: Altcoin Vector/X Ethereum is trading for $3,771 at time of writing, a fractional increase on the day. Moving on to Solana ( SOL ) challenger Sui ( SUI ), Altcoin Vector says that the layer-1 chain looks like it’s picking up momentum that could lead it to outperform Bitcoin ( BTC ) en route to a $5 price tag and beyond. “ETH is leading, even outpacing BTC – but this phase of rotation is about spotting alts that don’t just catch up… they outperform. SUI fits that bill. High-beta, strong trader interest, and just pumped +10% in 24h. Momentum is awakening. Impulse hasn’t fully kicked in yet – when it does, $5 target is just the beginning.” Source: Altcoin Vector/X SUI is trading for $4.22 at time of writing, a 5.2% increase on the day. Concluding its analysis with the top crypto asset by market cap, Altcoin Vector says that BTC’s latest dip shouldn’t be a concern. “Bitcoin’s drop isn’t a breakdown, it’s a healthy correction. Structure remains bullish. Optimal signal was cooling but now shows the first signs of recovering momentum. BTC is holding above support, though we could still test $112,500. Momentum paused, but trend is intact.” Source: Altcoin Vector/X BTC is trading for $119,503 at time of writing, a fractional increase during the last 24 hours.

Metaplanet Increases Bitcoin Holdings to $2 Billion with $92.5 Million in New Acquisitions With its latest purchase, the company reached a total of 17,132 BTC, making it the world's seventh-largest Bitcoin holder among publicly traded companies. According to the company's statement today, approximately $92.5 million was spent on the 780 BTC received, with the average cost per unit being $118,622. Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich stated in a post on social media platform X that the company acquired all its BTC assets at an average of $101,030.

2025-07-28T10:07:41,"Is Bitcoin Planning a Trap Again? Two Possible Scenarios For BTC!","The post Is Bitcoin Planning a Trap Again? Two Possible Scenarios For BTC! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin ended last week in a strong way . But some smart traders are warning that it might be a trick. A popular crypto trader named KillaXBT says that Bitcoin may be getting ready to move in a way that fools both buyers and sellers. It could drop first to scare people, and then go up. Or it could rise fast and then fall. He also points to a price gap near $117,000, which could act like a magnet. Let’s break it down. Last Week’s Moves Gave Early Clues Before this week even begin, KillaXBT had already posted two likely ideas for Bitcoin’s path. In the first idea, he expected Bitcoin to open strong, dip slightly near $116,000, and then bounce higher. Meanwhile, in the second idea, Bitcoin would fall even deeper, around $114,800, take out weak hands, and then bounce up hard. Out of the two, KillaXBT said the first idea was more likely. And last week, Bitcoin did dip to around $115,000, suggesting that the trap might have already happened. However, he also gave a warning: if Bitcoin fails to stay above recent lows, it could fall deeper, into the $112,000–$113,800 zone. That risk is still on the table. Watching the $117K Price Gap Last week’s dip to $115,800 was not just a random drop. According to KillaXBT, it was a smart “liquidity hunt”—a trick move to remove seller from the market before heading up again. For this week, the focus is on a key price gap near $117,316, which is the CME gap. KillaXBT believes this level could pull the price back like a magnet. So even if the price rises for a bit, it might return to this level to “fill the gap.” This Week: Two Big Scenarios Again Keeping things in mind KillaXBT shared a two key possible scenario for this week for bitcoin. His first scenario suggests Bitcoin might dip early in the week to form a higher low, then bounces back strongly. This move would shake out late buyers and set up a clean path for a bigger upward move. $BTC | Weekly Analysis Report Currently, BTC closed the weekly candle strongly, and the CME gap aligns closely with the previous weekly open. This area will likely serve as a key level for Continuation. There's significant liquidity sitting around 121K, which is also likely to… pic.twitter.com/nRlGNtNi1I — Killa (@KillaXBT) July 28, 2025 And the second scenario suggest that Bitcoin will rise fast to $120K–$121K, but it turns out to be a bull trap. This means people buying late might get stuck if the price suddenly drops. KillaXBT points to a danger zone between $119,300–$119,700. If Bitcoin gets rejected here, it could fall again to fill that $117K gap. As of now, Bitcoin is trading around $118,909 , showing a slight increase in the past 24 hours.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/is-bitcoin-planning-a-trap-again-two-possible-scenarios-for-btc/,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET","News",cryptocompare

2025-07-28T10:03:54,"XRP Giant Just Launched a $11.4M Bullish Position at $3.29. Is Something Big Coming?","A recent tweet by crypto enthusiast Radar has drawn attention to the notable action of an XRP whale who bet on a continued rally from current prices. According to the post, a whale wallet identified by the address prefix 0x2ef7…e6 initiated a significant long position on XRP worth $11.44 million at a price of $3.2979. This trade was recorded at 06:37, as seen in a data chart labeled “Latest Whale Activity,” which Radar included in the post. The whale’s action was marked as an “Open Long,” indicating an expectation that the price of XRP will increase from the current entry point. The sheer size of the position, which exceeds $11 million, has generated attention from market observers, especially as the entry price appears well above recent average market prices for XRP, which have remained significantly below the $3.29 level for an extended period. This has led to scrutiny about the legitimacy of the price feed or the source of the trade execution data. ALERT: #XRP GIANT JUST LAUNCHED A $11.4M BULLISH POSITION AT $3.29. WHAT’S HIS INSIDE SCOOP?? pic.twitter.com/F7Eggmy4B0 — Radar (@raderevaluate) July 28, 2025 Questions Raised About Price Accuracy and Timing Radar’s post did not include speculation, but the accompanying image reveals other high-value trades on Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) , and HYPE, with comparatively smaller positions. What stands out in the list is the XRP trade, both for its size and the recorded price. The data shows the whale entering at $3.2979. This price discrepancy has led to speculation about whether this trade occurred on a derivative platform, was the result of thin order book conditions, or potentially reflects an off-market agreement. Regardless of the mechanism, some XRP followers interpret the trade as an aggressive bullish signal. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Public Reactions and Speculation Under the tweet, user engagement included skepticism about the trade’s motivation. A reply by an X user, tschando, stated , “Perhaps only an idiot with a lot of money,” suggesting disbelief that any rational person would open such a large long position at that price point unless they possessed specific knowledge unavailable to the general public. Radar’s post included the statement: “ALERT: XRP GIANT JUST LAUNCHED A $11.4M BULLISH POSITION AT $3.29. WHAT’S HIS INSIDE SCOOP??” suggesting curiosity about whether the whale might be acting on private knowledge or an upcoming market development that has not yet been publicly disclosed. However, no evidence was provided to support such a conclusion. Whale Activity Tracking Across Multiple Assets The image used in Radar’s tweet comes from a real-time monitoring tool that tracks whale activity across various digital assets. Other transactions in the chart show long and short positions on BTC, ETH, and HYPE, but none rival the XRP trade in size or price irregularity. Notably, an Ethereum long position worth $7.87 million at $3,931.24 was also recorded shortly before the XRP trade. The overall context raises questions about the nature of the trading platform and the source of pricing used for this data. If confirmed accurate, the XRP whale’s move could reflect either an isolated trading event with unique circumstances or early positioning ahead of a potential shift in market sentiment.

2025-07-28T10:00:34,"60% Of Americans Uncomfortable With Crypto More Than They Understand It—Study","About 14% of US adults report owning Bitcoin or another type of crypto today. That’s roughly one in seven people. Few others plan to jump in soon. Just 4% say they’ll probably buy it in the near future. Most Americans aren’t interested. A solid 60% say they have no plans to ever buy crypto. Only 6% are unsure or unfamiliar with the idea. Crypto Ownership Skews Young According to a June 2–15 Gallup survey , men under 50 lead the way with a 25% ownership rate. Older men trail at 12%, while women aged 18 to 49 come in at 8%. Women 50 and older sit at 9%. College graduates and upper‑income adults each report 19% ownership. Conservatives are at 18%. Seniors and lower‑income earners fall to 7% and 9%, respectively. These gaps show that digital currency is concentrated among certain groups. Interest In Crypto Remains Limited Familiarity doesn’t seem to help much. Almost everyone—95%—has heard of crypto. But only 35% say they know something about it. A clear 60% say they’ve heard of it but don’t know much. About 55% call it “very risky,” and 32% say “somewhat risky.” Even among current owners, 42% see it as very risky. Among those with no interest in buying, that number jumps to 72%. Politics plays a part here too. Democrats rate crypto as very risky at 66%, liberals at 71%, while Republicans and conservatives both land at 45%. Regulatory Clarity Could Help Based on reports, the poll wrapped up just before US President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act on Friday. That new law aims to set clear rules for some types of crypto. It may ease worries over time. Right now, only 4% of adults name crypto as the best long‑term investment. By contrast, about 60% own stocks or real estate. Among investors—defined as people with $10,000 or more in stocks, bonds or mutual funds—ownership jumped from 2% in 2018 to 6% in 2021, and now sits at 17%. Yet 64% of these investors still say they’d never own crypto , up from 60% in 2021 but down from 72% in 2018. For now, crypto stays on the fringes. Younger men, higher earners and certain political groups make up most of the base. Many others will likely watch from the sidelines until they see clearer rules, better safety nets and solid returns. In the meantime, the market waits to see if broader interest will ever follow.
