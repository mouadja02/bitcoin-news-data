In 2027, it will range between $9.26 and $11.49, with an average price of $9.60. In 2030, it will range between $28.31 and $34.81, with an average price of $29.16. TON (The Open Network) is a decentralized protocol designed by Telegram and created by the community. The protocol is a distributed supercomputer, or “super server,” that consists of TON Blockchain , TON DNS, TON Storage, and TON Sites. The native token for the TON ecosystem is called Toncoin. “Will TON ever go up? Can TON reach the $10 mark? Where will TON be in five years?” These are the questions traders and investors ask. Let’s answer them and more in our Toncoin price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Toncoin Symbol TON Current price $3.25 Toncoin market cap $8.05B Trading volume $193.62M Circulating supply 2.47B All-time high $8.24 on Jun 15, 2024 All-time low $0.3906 on Sep 20, 2021 24-hour high $3.29 24-hour low $3.44 TON price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day variation) 6.38% 50-day SMA $3.02 200-day SMA $3.70 Sentiment Neutral Green days 22/30 (73%) Fear and Greed Index 75 (Greed) Toncoin price analysis: TON fails to sustain $3.35 pivot point On July 28, TON’s price dropped by 1.33% in 24 hours. Over the last 30 days, it rose by 16.56%. The TON price steadily declined after reaching the local high of $6 in early December 2024. In March 2025, it dropped beneath the $2.5 mark for the first time in over a year. It recovered from last month and reached a high of $3.50. Looking at its DeFi ecosystem, TON’s Total Value Locked (TVL) rose by 2.72% in the last 24 hours to $162M. TON/USD 1-day chart price analysis TONUSD chart by TradingView Toncoin remained bullish from last week with rising volatility. Its relative strength index is at 69.97, showing bullish-neutral momentum. TON, however, failed to hold above the $3.35 pivot point and 23.6% Fibonacci retracement, triggering sell-offs. The CMC Altcoin Season Index fell 29% weekly, with capital rotating toward Bitcoin (60.3% dominance), showing muted altcoin performance. TON/USD 4-hour chart price analysis TONUSD chart by TradingView The 4-hour chart shows that TON is correcting after facing resistance at $3.50. The coin is forming red engulfing candles, a bearish continuation pattern.

Our chart analysis indicates Toncoin’s profit-taking near resistance. The coin’s positive momentum has dropped over the last 24 hours. The coins’ drop could also be attributed to a muted altcoin market, as more capital flowed into Bitcoin. Why is TON up? The rise in TON value could be attributed to the recovery in the crypto market, as well as TonBit’s discovery and patching of a TON Virtual Machine bug on July 21 (TonBit), preventing potential network crashes and DApp disruptions. This maintained trust in Telegram’s ecosystem. Recent news Telegram’s deal with xAI, which would see Elon Musk’s AI company integrate into Telegram, is a work in progress despite an announcement from Pavel Durov. While Durov confirmed that the deal is yet to be signed, the Telegram founder said there is an “agreement in principle.” Is TON a good buy? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, TON will trade higher in the years to come. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Will TON reach $10? Yes, TON should rise above $10 in 2027. The move will come as the market recovers to previous highs. Will TON reach $100? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, TON is unlikely to reach $100 before 2031. Will TON reach $1,000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, TON is unlikely to reach $1000 before 2031. Does Toncoin have a future? TON has had a bullish run since its inception despite seasonal market corrections. The TON blockchain has a vibrant community of users and developers. Looking ahead, Toncoin has the potential to trade higher in the coming years. How much will a Toncoin be worth in 2030?

2025-07-28T20:30:38,"Bitcoin Backfire: How A $20-M Employee Heist Crashed Into Prison Time","In Beijing, prosecutors have jailed eight people for running a year‑long Bitcoin scam that drained over 140 million yuan—around $20 million—from a short‐video platform and then funneled the cash into crypto. According to a White Paper released by the People’s Procuratorate of Haidian District, the case ranks among the most complex anti‑corruption cases handled between 2020 and 2024. What began as simple bonus approvals inside the company turned into a year‑long scheme that hid stolen funds behind shell firms and digital currencies. Insider Power Opened Loopholes Based on reports , an employee named Feng held sole control over service‑provider onboarding, bonus qualifications and payout approvals. He quietly tweaked bonus policies to create gaps that only he and two outside helpers, Tang and Yang, could exploit. Fake documents flowed in with private data that Feng leaked. Then the trio rerouted bonus payments into made‑up accounts, instead of rewarding real work. By the time auditors spotted the missing cash, nearly 140 million yuan had already vanished. Fake Firms And Laundering Chain The gang used shell companies with no real operations. Yang directed associate Wang and others to set up around 10 of these paper businesses. All they did was collect the bogus bonus payouts. From there, funds jumped across multiple bank accounts until they landed in Yang’s hands. Feng then ordered the next step: converting it into Bitcoin . They split the loot on eight different international platforms and mixed the coins, scrambling the transaction trail to hide the money’s origin. Authorities Trace Bitcoin Flow Prosecutor Li Tao, of Haidian’s Science and Technology Crime division, built a detailed map of the scam. By comparing company data logs, bank records and blockchain transfers, his team peeled back each layer of concealment. They even recovered over 90 Bitcoin during the investigation—enough to prove exactly how the “closed‑loop” laundering chain worked. Each recovered coin tied back to the stolen rewards, confirming every twist of the money’s path. Sentencing took into account each person’s role. Feng received the longest term—14 years and six months behind bars—while the other seven were handed prison sentences ranging from three to 14 years, plus hefty fines. All were found guilty of occupational embezzlement. This case serves as a warning: when one person holds too much power, even routine bonus systems can become vehicles for big fraud—and modern crypto tools can’t guarantee anonymity forever.

2025-07-28T20:30:00,"Stablecoins Look Here To Stay","Summary Recent U.S. law cements the role of stablecoins as a means of digital payment in the future of finance. We still see bitcoin as a potential return diversifier. U.S. stocks pushed to all-time highs, partly on signs of big tech companies upping AI investment plans. Japanese stocks also hit record highs. We expect the Fed will hold rates steady this week. We watch for U.S. trade deals as the Aug. 1 deadline approaches and for tariff impacts in Q2 GDP data. Transcript New U.S. legislation is cementing the role of stablecoins as part of the future of finance. We think their adoption could bolster the dollar’s dominance in global markets. 1) Going mainstream Stablecoins are digital tokens pegged to a fiat currency – typically the U.S. dollar – and backed by reserve assets. They fuse the frictionless transfer of cryptocurrency with the perceived stability of fiat currency. The U.S. is advancing several laws aimed at bringing stablecoins and other digital assets into the mainstream. The Genius Act creates a comprehensive stablecoin framework. It defines stablecoins as a payment method, not an asset; spells out who can issue them; and prohibits these issuers from paying interest. We think it has implications for the U.S. dollar and U.S. Treasury bills. 2) Limited impact on Treasury yields U.S. Treasury bills are one of the assets the Genius Act allows stablecoin issuers to hold in reserve. So growing demand for stablecoins could boost demand for Treasury bills. But we think that demand could be offset by two things. One, money flowing out of assets similar to Treasury bills, like money market funds. And two, a likely surge in newly issued Treasury bills. That means the impact on bill yields may be limited. 3) Reinforcing dollar dominance The Genius Act could reinforce dollar dominance by enabling a tokenized U.S. dollar-based ecosystem for international payments. Stablecoins may offer users in emerging markets easier access to the U.S. dollar over volatile local currencies. Yet in major economies, the ban on interest payments could slow adoption. The ban aims to protect banking by preventing a low-friction rival that could compete with bank deposits and hurt traditional lending. We see stablecoins as a new part of the future of finance – and this U.S. legislation is aiming to put the U.S. at the center of cryptocurrency innovation. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- New U.S. legislation – notably this month’s Genius Act – is cementing the role of stablecoins as a payment method in the future of finance, one of five mega forces we see driving returns. Stablecoins are pegged to major currencies, mainly the U.S. dollar and could solidify its dominance in global markets, though other countries are exploring alternatives. We think rising demand for stablecoins will have little impact on short-term Treasury yields. We still see bitcoin as a distinct return driver. This has been a banner year for bitcoin, up 25% this year as the U.S. is in the process of adopting a couple of key laws aimed at bringing digital payments and assets into the mainstream – and making the U.S. the crypto capital of the world. One determines which financial regulator oversees different digital assets. That bill is still working its way through Congress. Another – the Genius Act, signed into law earlier this month – creates a comprehensive payment stablecoin framework. Stablecoins are digital tokens pegged to a fiat currency and backed by reserve assets. They fuse the frictionless transfer of crypto with the perceived stability of fiat currency. Though stablecoins are small relative to the size of the overall crypto universe at a 7% share, their adoption has grown quickly since 2020 to reach about $250 billion. See the chart. We see two implications of the Genius Act on the U.S. dollar and Treasury bills. The act defines stablecoins to function as a payment method, not an investment product; prohibits issuers from paying interest; and limits issuance to federally regulated banks, some registered nonbanks and state-chartered firms. This regulation could reinforce dollar dominance by enabling a tokenized U.S. dollar-based ecosystem for international payments. Users in emerging markets may get easier access to the U.S. dollar over volatile local currencies. Yet in major economies, adoption may be limited by the ban on interest payments, which aims to prevent a low-friction rival that could compete with bank deposits and hurt traditional lending. Implications of the Genius Act The act also spells out what assets stablecoin issuers may hold in reserve: mostly repurchase agreements, money market funds and U.S. Treasury bills with a maturity of 93 days or less. Leading stablecoin issuers Tether and Circle together hold at least $120 billion in Treasury bills, only about 2% of the Treasury’s roughly $6 trillion bills outstanding. That demand could grow with the stablecoin market and spur new buying of bills – but the impact on yields will likely be limited. First, stablecoin demand for bills is likely to be offset by money shifting from similar assets, so little net new demand. Second, bill issuance is set to keep surging due to the Treasury’s preference to boost the funding of persistent deficits with more short-term debt. The U.S. is not alone in acting. Hong Kong’s new regulation aims to attract stablecoin innovation. Europe is exploring a digital euro, though its use would be limited to avoid hurting banks. If other countries permit interest-bearing stablecoins or pursue central bank digital currencies, it could weaken the dollar’s role in trade finance, though the U.S. could then permit interest. This wave of mainstreaming digital assets – through a regulatory framework and U.S. administration support – bodes well for greater adoption, the core investment case we see for bitcoin and helping make it a distinct driver of risk and return in portfolios. Stablecoins are still a relatively small part of the broader crypto universe – and as this evolves it’s not clear how stablecoins will compete with other digital assets. Our bottom line We see stablecoins as a new part of the future of finance – and new U.S. legislation is aiming to put the U.S. at the center of digital asset innovation. We still see bitcoin adoption as a distinct driver of risk and return. Market backdrop U.S. stocks pushed to fresh all-time highs, with the S&P 500 now up about 8% for the year. Alphabet’s planned increase in capital spending gave another boost to the AI trade. Japanese stocks soared after the U.S. and Japan struck an agreement on trade at tariffs below what the U.S. had been pushing for previously. The Topix index gained 4% on the week. U.S. Treasury yields were mostly steady, with the 10-year yield at 4.40% and now hovering within a range of roughly 4.20% to 4.60%. We see the Federal Reserve holding rates steady as tariff-related inflation pressures begin surfacing in U.S. inflation data. We expect a modest rebound in U.S. Q2 GDP after it shrank in Q1 but watch for tariff impacts on consumption and investment. We are watching for U.S. trade deals as the Aug. 1 deadline approaches. And we look for signs of a Bank of Japan rate hike within the year given last week’s U.S.-Japan trade deal, though our base case remains early 2026.

2025-07-28T20:25:11,"U.S. Stock Market’s Pivotal Day: Navigating Mixed Signals","BitcoinWorld U.S. Stock Market’s Pivotal Day: Navigating Mixed Signals In the ever-evolving landscape of global finance, the performance of the U.S. stock market often serves as a barometer for broader economic health. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors, understanding these traditional market movements is not just an academic exercise; it’s a crucial part of anticipating potential shifts in the digital asset space. Recently, the three major U.S. stock market indices concluded trading with a mixed bag of results, sparking discussions across trading desks and online forums alike. This seemingly subtle divergence holds significant implications, signaling underlying complexities that warrant a closer look for anyone navigating the interconnected worlds of traditional finance and crypto. What Do Mixed Signals from the U.S. Stock Market Indices Tell Us? On a recent trading day, the performance of the leading U.S. stock market indices presented a nuanced picture: S&P 500: Closed up by a marginal +0.02%. Nasdaq Composite: Saw a more notable gain of +0.33%. Dow Jones Industrial Average: Dipped slightly by -0.14%. This mixed outcome is more than just a collection of numbers; it reflects different sectors of the economy experiencing varying pressures and opportunities. The S&P 500, often considered the broadest measure of the U.S. equity market, remained nearly flat, indicating a general equilibrium. The Nasdaq’s positive movement suggests continued strength in technology and growth stocks, which often thrive on innovation and future potential. Conversely, the slight decline in the Dow, heavily weighted towards industrial and traditional blue-chip companies, might point to concerns in sectors more sensitive to interest rates or inflation. To put this into perspective, here’s a snapshot of the day’s closing: Index Daily Change Primary Focus S&P 500 +0.02% Broad Market Performance Nasdaq Composite +0.33% Technology & Growth Stocks Dow Jones Industrial Average -0.14% Industrial & Blue-Chip Stocks Why Did the U.S. Stock Market Experience Such a Diverse Close? The reasons behind a mixed market close are often multifaceted, reflecting a complex interplay of economic indicators, corporate earnings, and investor sentiment. Several factors could contribute to such a scenario: Inflationary Concerns: Persistent inflation data can lead to expectations of tighter monetary policy from the Federal Reserve, which might weigh on traditional industries (Dow) but have less immediate impact on growth-oriented tech companies (Nasdaq) that are often valued on future earnings potential. Interest Rate Speculation: Uncertainty surrounding the Fed’s next move on interest rates can cause investors to rotate capital. Higher rates can make borrowing more expensive, impacting businesses, but might also signal economic strength. Corporate Earnings Reports: Strong earnings from key technology companies could have bolstered the Nasdaq, while mixed or weaker reports from other sectors might have dragged down the Dow. Geopolitical Developments: Global events, from supply chain disruptions to international conflicts, can create uncertainty that affects different market sectors unevenly. For instance, energy or commodity-related news might impact industrial stocks more directly. Understanding these underlying currents is vital, as they paint a picture of economic health that can spill over into other asset classes, including digital currencies. How Does U.S. Stock Market Performance Influence the Crypto Landscape? While often viewed as distinct, the traditional U.S. stock market and the cryptocurrency market are increasingly intertwined. The mixed close, in particular, offers several insights for crypto investors: Risk-On/Risk-Off Sentiment: When traditional markets show signs of instability or uncertainty (like a mixed close rather than a clear upward trend), investors might shift to ‘risk-off’ assets. Historically, this could sometimes benefit perceived safe havens, but crypto, particularly Bitcoin, has often behaved like a ‘risk-on’ asset, correlating with tech stocks. The Nasdaq’s strength might suggest a continued appetite for growth assets, which could indirectly support crypto. Liquidity Flows: Major movements in the stock market can impact the availability of capital for other investments. If investors are rebalancing portfolios within equities, less capital might flow into speculative assets like cryptocurrencies in the short term. Economic Confidence: A stable or moderately growing traditional market often fosters a general sense of economic confidence. This can encourage broader investment, including into emerging asset classes like crypto. A mixed market, however, introduces an element of caution. Institutional Adoption: As more institutional players enter the crypto space, their investment decisions are often influenced by their broader macroeconomic outlook, which is heavily shaped by the performance of the U.S. stock market . The key takeaway is that while crypto has its own unique drivers, it does not exist in a vacuum. Broader economic sentiment, as reflected in the U.S. stock market , can certainly set the tone for investor behavior in digital assets. Navigating Volatility: Strategies for Savvy Investors in a Mixed Market For both traditional and crypto investors, a mixed U.S. stock market close underscores the importance of a well-thought-out investment strategy. Here are some actionable insights: Diversification is Key: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. A diversified portfolio across different asset classes (equities, bonds, real estate, and digital assets) can help mitigate risk during periods of market uncertainty. Long-Term Perspective: Short-term market fluctuations, like a mixed day, are normal. Focusing on long-term investment goals rather than reacting to daily movements can lead to more stable returns. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of economic indicators, Federal Reserve announcements, and corporate earnings. This knowledge empowers you to make informed decisions rather than emotional ones. Reassess Risk Tolerance: A mixed market is a good time to re-evaluate your personal risk tolerance. Are you comfortable with the current level of exposure to volatile assets like cryptocurrencies, given the broader market signals? Dollar-Cost Averaging: For crypto investors, employing dollar-cost averaging can be particularly effective. This involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the asset’s price, which helps average out the purchase price over time and reduces the impact of volatility. Challenges and Opportunities in the Current Economic Climate The mixed performance of the U.S. stock market highlights both challenges and opportunities. On the challenge front, persistent inflation, potential interest rate hikes, and geopolitical tensions continue to create headwinds. These factors can increase the cost of capital, dampen consumer spending, and introduce supply chain disruptions, all of which can affect corporate profitability and investor confidence. However, opportunities also abound. For instance, the resilience of the Nasdaq indicates continued innovation and growth in the technology sector, which can drive long-term economic expansion. Furthermore, periods of market uncertainty can create opportunities for savvy investors to acquire assets at more attractive valuations. In the crypto space, continued development in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and Web3 infrastructure presents long-term growth potential, irrespective of short-term traditional market movements. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for the U.S. Stock Market and Beyond? The trajectory of the U.S. stock market in the coming months will largely depend on key economic data releases, particularly inflation reports and employment figures, as well as the Federal Reserve’s response. Investors will be closely watching for signs of sustained disinflation, which could lead to a more dovish stance from the Fed and potentially stimulate broader market growth. For the crypto market, this means a continued watch on correlations with tech stocks and broader economic sentiment. While crypto assets strive for decentralization and independence, their price action often reflects the ebb and flow of global liquidity and investor appetite for risk. The future will likely see further integration and influence between traditional financial markets and the burgeoning digital asset economy. Summary: Navigating the Nuances of a Mixed Market The recent mixed close of the major U.S. stock market indices – S&P 500 nearly flat, Nasdaq up, and Dow down – offers a compelling snapshot of a market grappling with diverse forces. This divergence highlights the varying health of different economic sectors and the ongoing debate surrounding inflation, interest rates, and corporate performance. For cryptocurrency investors, these signals are not to be ignored. They provide crucial context for understanding broader market sentiment, liquidity flows, and the evolving relationship between traditional finance and digital assets. By staying informed, diversifying portfolios, and maintaining a long-term perspective, investors can better navigate the complexities of this interconnected financial world and position themselves for success, regardless of the daily market gyrations. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does a ‘mixed close’ in the U.S. stock market signify? A mixed close indicates that different major stock market indices (like the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow) moved in different directions, or with highly varied magnitudes, on the same trading day. It suggests that various sectors of the economy are experiencing different pressures and opportunities, rather than a uniform market sentiment. Q2: How does the U.S. stock market performance typically correlate with cryptocurrency prices? Historically, cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, have shown some correlation with the Nasdaq Composite, particularly with tech and growth stocks. When traditional markets, especially tech, perform well, it often signals a ‘risk-on’ environment, which can benefit crypto. Conversely, traditional market downturns can sometimes lead to crypto price declines as investors pull back from speculative assets. Q3: Should I adjust my crypto investment strategy based on daily stock market closes? While it’s important to be aware of broader market trends, daily fluctuations in the U.S. stock market should not necessarily dictate your entire crypto investment strategy. A long-term perspective, combined with strategies like dollar-cost averaging and diversification, is often more effective than reacting to short-term market noise. However, significant shifts in traditional markets can signal broader economic changes that warrant re-evaluation of your overall portfolio. Q4: What are the key economic indicators to watch that influence both stock and crypto markets? Key economic indicators include inflation rates (e.g., CPI, PCE), interest rate decisions by the Federal Reserve, employment reports (e.g., non-farm payrolls), GDP growth figures, and corporate earnings reports. These indicators provide insights into economic health and monetary policy, which can influence investor sentiment across all asset classes. Q5: Is crypto a safe haven asset when the U.S. stock market is volatile? The debate on whether crypto acts as a safe haven is ongoing. While some proponents argue for its independence from traditional finance, in practice, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have often shown correlation with risk assets during periods of high volatility in the U.S. stock market. Its role as a safe haven is still developing and is not universally accepted. If you found this analysis insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

2025-07-28T20:00:39,"Founder of Turkish crypto exchange ICRYPEX has been detained in Turkey","Law enforcement authorities in Turkey have detained the founder of a cryptocurrency exchange, who allegedly funded a prominent journalist, himself recently arrested for criticizing the ruling elite. The businessman is under investigation for allegedly supplying narcotics to a victim whom he is also accused of trying to kill. The coin trading platform he was managing has been geared for global expansion, the Turkish press noted. Crypto executive jailed in Turkey on drug and murder charges Gökalp İçer, chair of the Board of Directors of the Turkish digital asset exchange ICRYPEX, has been detained in Istanbul, Hürriyet Daily News and Türkiye Today informed readers in separate reports. The entrepreneur has been taken into custody on charges of “procuring drugs” and “attempted murder with probable intent,” the English-language editions unveiled, quoting the city’s Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office. Its statement details that investigators went after İçer when the victim, identified only by their initials, G.Ç., was hospitalized in intensive care on July 14, this year, after consuming narcotics allegedly provided by the suspect. The person remains in critical condition, and the investigation is still underway to establish all circumstances in the case, the publications added. ICRYPEX was founded by İçer in the spring of 2018. The Turkey-based crypto exchange has been trying to grow beyond its domestic market, having already opened branches in Dubai, London, and Toronto. As part of its push to become a global player, the Turkish platform sought to increase its presence in Latin America and South Africa, Hürriyet highlighted. The move against its executive is likely to affect these plans. Moreover, it comes against the backdrop of a major crackdown on crypto service providers in Turkey , which resulted in the blocking of dozens of websites, accused by the nation’s top financial regulator of unlicensed activities. Turkish media links İçer’s detention to Altaylı’s arrest According to Türkiye Today, ICRYPEX is linked to Fatih Altaylı , a renowned journalist and former TV host in Turkey who recently found himself in trouble with the government over critical comments regarding its leadership. The crypto company has been reportedly sponsoring Altaylı’s broadcasts on YouTube, one of which led to his detention and subsequent arrest last month. Altaylı was taken to jail on June 21 and charged with “threatening the President” with remarks he made in a video posted on his channel . Authorities interpreted those as targeting Turkey’s long-serving head of state, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. In the live stream aired the previous day, the journalist had stated that, historically, Turks have always questioned the authority of their rulers, even during Ottoman times, emphasizing public expectations of accountability from high-level officials. Prosecutors from the same Istanbul office insisted his statements constituted an offense under an article of Turkey’s criminal code meant to prevent attacks on the president as a significant institution. In a testimony, Altaylı denied making any threats against the president, explaining he was merely sharing his opinion on poll results showing that some 70% of Turkish people would oppose allowing Erdoğan to remain in power indefinitely. He argued that his political commentary had been distorted by opponents who circulated only a short clip, edited in a way to create the impression he was threatening the Turkish leader, which went viral on social media. He also submitted the full record to back his claims. Speaking in the presence of lawyers, Altaylı elaborated: “There is absolutely no expression in my speech that can be interpreted as a threat or even an implication of one against the President. The statements have been deliberately distorted by removing their context. I am not responsible for this misrepresentation.” “I did not threaten President Erdogan. I only provided historical context. I do not accept the charges brought against me,” Altaylı reiterated later in court, but the judge concluded his statements did amount to a criminal threat against Erdogan and ordered him held in pretrial detention. The ruling sparked condemnation from colleagues and calls for his release. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.
