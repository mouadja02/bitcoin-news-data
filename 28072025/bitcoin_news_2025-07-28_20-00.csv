2025-07-28T17:57:54,"EarnMining app brings stable daily BTC rewards regardless of BTC price fluctuations","Although market forecasts suggest substantial growth, Bitcoin’s history reminds us that every surge is often followed by significant pullbacks. The cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile, and investors often find themselves trapped in a cycle of emotional buying and panic selling. EarnMining: Turning Bitcoin into a Daily Revenue Stream EarnMining offers a smarter alternative to traditional HODLing. Rather than waiting for Bitcoin’s price to rise, users can convert their idle BTC into a daily income-generating asset . With fixed USD-pegged earnings , investors gain predictability and protection from price crashes. This approach transforms Bitcoin from a volatile, speculative asset into a consistent, income-yielding instrument . EarnMining provides contract-based earning models that automatically distribute rewards every 24 hours—regardless of how the crypto market behaves.

When you invest BTC or other supported cryptocurrencies into EarnMining, the system immediately locks the value in USD based on real-time exchange rates. Your daily earnings remain fixed , even if Bitcoin’s price fluctuates. Upon withdrawal, your earnings are converted back to BTC using current rates. This unique structure protects you from the emotional rollercoaster of crypto markets. Whether Bitcoin is up or down, your income is always flowing . Why EarnMining Outperforms Simple BTC Holding Many investors assume holding Bitcoin is the best path to profit. But that strategy only works if prices rise —and the gains are often locked until you sell. By contrast, EarnMining empowers users to earn from their digital assets daily , without having to time the market. Consider this: if you hold BTC and it increases by $5,000, you’ll only gain if you sell. But investing that same BTC into EarnMining could yield up to $2,856 in daily income under their high-end contract tiers—producing recurring returns rather than a one-time windfall.

Over $150B flowed into spot BTC ETFs since SEC approval, reshaping market demand. ETF purchases often outpace BTC mining supply by 10x, fueling a 160% price surge. Since the U.S. SEC approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, over $150 billion in capital has flooded into the market. The sudden inflows show powerful demand from both institutional and retail investors seeking direct Bitcoin exposure through a traditional, regulated format. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) are leading the pack in both assets and volume. With more than 1.29 million BTC now held across all of these funds, spot Bitcoin ETFs account for over 6% of the total circulating Bitcoin supply. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 10, 2024, followed a decade of regulatory delays. A key legal victory came in 2023 when a federal court sided with Grayscale in its challenge against the SEC, stating the agency had not properly explained its reasoning for rejecting spot products while allowing futures-based ones.

The purchase was disclosed Monday, making Metaplanet the largest non-US corporate Bitcoin investor. The firm spent an average of ¥17.5 million ($118,145) per coin on the new BTC, buying a total of about $92 million worth. Its overall average acquisition price for all holdings is now $99,640 per Bitcoin. Top Non-US Bitcoin Treasury With this move, Metaplanet remains the only non-US entity in the global top 10 Bitcoin treasuries, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET. It becomes the seventh of all time, ranking behind Truth Social’s parent company with 18,430 BTC but in front of Galaxy Digital’s 12,830 BTC. Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) alone possesses far more by a vast amount, with 607,770 BTC valued in excess of $72 billion. Strategic Bitcoin Accumulation Metaplanet’s Bitcoin plan is just one aspect of a broader strategy. The company has indicated using its war chests to acquire cash-generating assets, including a potential Japanese digital bank. CEO Simon Gerovich told Forbes Japan that the company is developing a “Japan-native model” for Bitcoin adoption , which is compatible with local regulations and tax regimes. Metaplanet Stock Surges Investors have greeted Metaplanet’s Bitcoin emphasis warmly. Its share price is up 517% year to year and has risen 246% in 2025 alone, trading at $8.36. “In one year, we were the nation’s best-performing stock,” Gerovich said, pointing to record turnover and a ¥1 trillion market cap.

2025-07-28T17:05:24,"Pundit: Things Will Change for XRP Overnight. This Rally Is Just the Beginning","In a recent post on X, crypto commentator Bale delivered a strong message to XRP holders: “What people don’t realise about XRP is that overnight things will change. We pumped over 60% in one week. This is just the beginning.” His words come at a time when XRP is witnessing a major breakout that many analysts believe could mark the start of a long-awaited bull run. XRP’s Explosive Breakout Over the past few weeks, XRP surged from around $2.20 to nearly $3.65 , registering more than 60% growth, one of its strongest moves in recent years. This spike wasn’t just a momentary jump; it came with high volume and was supported by a broad shift in market sentiment. XRP’s technical charts indicate a breakout from a multi-month consolidation range, a pattern that typically precedes sustained upward momentum. This breakout marks a significant change in the asset’s trend structure, with XRP now forming higher highs and higher lows, a classic sign of a new bullish phase. What people don’t realise about XRP is that overnight things will change. We pumped over 60% in one week. This is just the beginning. — BALE (@AltcoinBale) July 28, 2025 Bullish Technical Setups Analysts have identified several bullish patterns, with a recent golden cross on the 50-day and 200-day moving averages confirming the strength of the upward trend. Veteran trader Peter Brandt also identified a rare “compound fulcrum” pattern, projecting a potential target of $4.47, while other projections range as high as $6 if momentum continues. Currently, XRP trades comfortably above key support around $3.10–$3.15, a zone it recently reclaimed after months of resistance. As long as the price holds above this level, technical analysts agree that further upside remains likely. Fuel Behind the Rally This rally isn’t just about charts. A convergence of macro and market dynamics is fueling the move. XRP is benefiting from renewed altcoin interest as Bitcoin consolidates near all-time highs. This has led to a shift in capital toward large-cap altcoins like XRP and Ethereum. Adding to the momentum, institutional participation has increased sharply. Derivatives open interest in XRP is now above $10 billion, reflecting a sharp uptick in confidence from whales and professional traders. Meanwhile, recent U.S. legislation aimed at providing regulatory clarity for cryptocurrencies has helped boost investor sentiment across the board. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Overnight Change May Be Closer Than Expected Bale’s point, that things can shift overnight, is especially relevant in the crypto landscape. Sentiment, liquidity, and price action can change drastically in hours, especially when assets like XRP break major resistance levels. While many traders remain cautious, XRP’s recent move suggests it may be entering an accelerated phase, where rapid gains occur with little warning. If the current structure holds, XRP could soon retest the $4 mark. A break above that may open the path to $5–$6, especially if broader altcoin strength continues and Bitcoin maintains its dominance. The Beginning of a New Era? XRP’s recent breakout, supported by strong technicals, institutional interest , and favorable market conditions, suggests that the current rally may be far from over. Bale’s assertion that “things will change overnight” captures the nature of XRP’s market cycle, a sudden, powerful move that leaves most behind. For now, all eyes remain on XRP’s next levels. If momentum persists, this may well be remembered as the beginning of the rally that redefined XRP’s role in the crypto market.

The delay, announced Monday , gives the agency until September 18 to decide on whether to approve the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF. The fund application was submitted in June by Trump Media & Technology Group, which operates the social platform and has increasingly positioned itself as a player in the crypto market. Truth Social’s bitcoin fund is one of several crypto ETFs caught in a broader regulatory pause under new SEC Chair Paul Atkins. Atkins’ team on Monday also postponed decisions on the Grayscale Solana Trust and Canary Capital’s proposed Litecoin ETF . This is the latest in a string of postponements by the SEC under newly appointed Chair Paul Atkins. The SEC typically takes the maximum amount of time — 270 days — to approve ETF applications. Behind the scenes, the agency has been in talks with fund issuers about key sticking points such as staking and the mechanics of in-kind redemptions — particularly those related to pending Solana-based ETF applications, CoinDesk previously reported . Truth Social’s Bitcoin ETF comes a year and a half after the SEC, under former Chair Gary Gensler, greenlit a batch of spot bitcoin ETFs that have collectively drawn over $55 billion in investor inflows since launching in January. In its Monday filing, the SEC said it was extending the review period for the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF to “allow sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein.” Truth Social is also pursuing additional crypto products.

2025-07-28T17:01:09,"Why is Ethereum (ETH) Soaring? Bernstein Analysts Warn About One Thing","Finance company Bernstein, which also publishes analyses on cryptocurrencies, stated that the main factors behind Ethereum’s value increase of over 55% in the last 30 days are spot ETF inflows and new “Ethereum treasury” companies that add ETH to their company balance sheets. In a note published today, the firm assessed how these new institutional buyers could impact Ethereum's supply, return rates, and risk dynamics across the network. By Bernstein's estimate, leading companies like SharpLink Gaming, BitMine Immersion, Bit Digital, and BTCS purchased approximately 876,000 ETH in July. These companies hold 0.9% of the total supply of Ethereum in their reserves thanks to capital raised through public markets and private investors. Bernstein describes this trend as the application of Strategy's Bitcoin treasury model to Ethereum, while noting an additional element on the Ethereum side: staking. Recalling that Strategy has established a long-term, low-leverage portfolio of 607,770 BTC, Bernstein notes that Ethereum treasury companies aim to achieve operational returns by combining this capital structure with staking agreements. Related News: Explosive Volume Surge Recorded in 14 Altcoins on South Korean Exchanges - Here's the List Today, staking yields hover just below 3% and have historically ranged between 3% and 5%. According to Bernstein, these rates suggest that a $1 billion Ethereum treasury could generate annual returns of between $30 million and $50 million. This revenue model fundamentally differs from Bitcoin treasury strategies because, while Bitcoin's revenue flows to network miners, Ethereum's revenue flows directly to coin holders. However, this introduces new liquidity decisions and risks. Strategy, for example, maintains a 15–20% debt-to-portfolio ratio and holds 5–6 times its debt in liquid assets while keeping its assets fully liquid. In contrast, Ethereum treasuries must consider complex factors such as staking exit sequences, retaking, DeFi smart contract risks, and asset-liability balances. Bernstein cautions that staking transactions typically have high liquidity, but exit queues can take several days. The search for additional returns, particularly on restaking platforms like Eigenlayer, carries significant risks. Companies that adopt prudent balance sheet management combined with institutional-grade custody solutions are more likely to achieve greater scale. The firm also acknowledges that Bitcoin treasury models offer a good foundation for institutionalization, but argues that success or failure on the Ethereum side will depend entirely on risk management capabilities. Bernstein also cites the reasons why some companies are considering Ethereum as a strategic treasury asset, citing stablecoin expansion and the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA). Many players, including major platforms like Coinbase and Robinhood, are migrating these transactions to Ethereum and its layer-2 networks. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-28T17:00:50,"Crypto price today: Bitcoin consolidates after weekend rally, altcoins shed gains as ETH fails to break $4k","After staging a strong rally over the weekend, fuelled by renewed enthusiasm around the EU–US trade deal, Bitcoin cooled off on Monday and consolidated below $119,000, as momentum remained skewed towards Ethereum and the broader altcoin market. The total market capitalisation of the crypto sector briefly reclaimed the $4 trillion mark before slipping to $3.9 trillion at press time, weighed down by losses across both Bitcoin and altcoins. Despite the dip, market sentiment climbed to a monthly high of 75, moving deeper into greed territory and rising two points from the previous day. This indicates that investor appetite for risk remains strong. Overall, the current drawdown appears to reflect a healthy consolidation following the brief rally, likely driven by subtle profit-taking among short-term traders and growing caution ahead of the upcoming FOMC meeting. By late Asian trading hours on Monday, most top altcoins had surrendered their weekly gains, with only a handful holding on to modest single-digit profits. Why is Bitcoin stuck? Bitcoin bulls attempted to reclaim $119,000 multiple times today before retreating towards the $118k support band. A sharp wave of liquidations triggered the correction, largely concentrated around $119,000, which pressured the price lower. According to derivatives data, Bitcoin saw more than $55.6 million in total liquidations in the last 24 hours, of which over $41.5 million came from long positions. Generally, this means that a large number of traders had bet on further upside but were caught offside as the price stalled below resistance. The 24-hour BTC liquidation heatmap further illustrates this pressure point. A dense band of liquidation activity was visible between $118,800 and $119,800, signaling a heavy concentration of leveraged long positions. Bitcoin 24-hour liquidation heatmap. Source: CoinGlass. When Bitcoin failed to sustain a breakout above this zone, a chain reaction of automatic sell orders was triggered as long positions were forcefully closed by exchanges due to margin calls. The impact of this was amplified by elevated speculative activity. Derivatives volume surged over 100% to reach $71.38 billion in the past 24 hours, while open interest rose to $85.67 billion, showing that traders were aggressively entering new positions. As the price declined, it entered another liquidation-heavy zone around $117,800 to $118,200, also highlighted on the heatmap. This area has since acted as a temporary support, helping to stabilize the price in late trading hours. Beyond technical dynamics, broader macro uncertainty also played a role in dampening sentiment. Traders entered Monday’s session with increased caution ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, set to conclude on Wednesday. Equity and crypto markets remain alert to any signals on the Fed’s interest rate path. While market participants expect no change at this meeting, commentary on possible rate cuts later in 2025, if dovish, could fuel another leg higher; in contrast, a neutral or hawkish tone would likely restrain risk appetite. For the rally to continue, traders will be watching for a clear break above $119,800, the upper edge of the high-risk liquidation zone. This level has acted as a key resistance, and reclaiming it would signal renewed strength and reduce the risk of further long-side liquidations. Some market analysts have also flagged this level as a key area to watch. See below.

BTC/USD weekly chart. Source: Rekt Capital. “Turning ~$119200 into support via a retest could occur next week (maybe even via a wick). However, for the moment BTC needs to avoid an upside wick beyond the Bull Flag Top resistance otherwise price would stay in the Range,” the analyst said. Meanwhile, well-followed market commentator Ali told followers in a July 28 X post that Bitcoin’s hourly chart has flashed a buy signal on the TD Sequential indicator, suggesting a potential short-term rebound. The TD Sequential is a momentum-based indicator designed to identify potential trend reversals or exhaustion points by counting a series of consecutive candles in the same direction—making it a tool often used to time short-term market pivots. Based on the chart Ali shared, the buy signal emerged after a nine-candle downward sequence, which typically signals selling exhaustion and a possible price turnaround. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $118,129, down 0.6% in the past 24 hours. Altcoin market The altcoin market cap rose 4.8% over the past 24 hours to an intraday high of $1.74 trillion before a sell-off ensued that brought it down 1.8% in the period to $1.63 trillion. Ethereum (ETH) rallied for the third straight day, crossed the $3,900 mark earlier today for the first time this year, before it lost most of its gains and fell back to a little above $3,800 as of press time, as short liquidations toppled the buying momentum from bulls. The leading altcoin with a market cap of $461 billion has gained nearly 57% over the last 30 days, far outperforming BTC, which has only managed to hold gains of around 10%. Continued strong inflows into Ether ETFs for the third week now point to a shift in market sentiment, which could continue to improve investor sentiment ahead. For context, the spot Ether funds have drawn in $1.85 billion in inflows this month, over twice that of their Bitcoin counterparts. If these products continue to see such massive inflows, they could continue to bolster a bullish outlook for Ethereum. Despite the bullish momentum seen lately, it’s still stuck under a key resistance, notably the $4,000 mark, at which it faced rejection multiple times since the beginning of this year. Analysts note that until ETH manages to close above that level, bears will continue to be in the game. According to market commentator Ted, Ethereum is “being pulled like a magnet” toward the $4,000 level, where a large cluster of liquidity is waiting. The analyst pointed to dense ask-side orders just above the $3,900 level.

According to the trader, ETH seems to have broken out of a short-term consolidation phase, with historical data suggesting that such a breakout has previously been followed by strong rallies. As such, ZYN expects Ethereum to target $4,300 by the end of this week. Ethereum has been leading broader market rallies in recent sessions and could reignite gains if it breaks convincingly above the $4,000 mark. But for now, its failure to breach that key resistance has weighed on sentiment, with most altcoins giving up earlier gains and only a handful holding on to modest single-digit profits. See below.
