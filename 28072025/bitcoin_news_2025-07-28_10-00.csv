2025-07-28T07:59:40,"Bitcoin Bull Run in October Could Ignite a 5x Altcoin Rally","The post Bitcoin Bull Run in October Could Ignite a 5x Altcoin Rally appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin has already made big moves this year, jumping over 25% from $89,000 to an all-time high of $123,000. While the price is now moving sideways, many traders are looking ahead to October, a month known for strong Bitcoin rallies. With key signals flashing bullish, some believe a powerful crypto bull run may be just around the corner. Here’s how higher bitcoin price could surge by the ends of this year? And what might happen to altcoins if it does? Bitcoin Bull Market Expected in October Last week, Bitcoin closed with its highest weekly candle ever, over $119,000 . A major resistance level around $115,000, also known as the CME gap, has now been cleared. BTC is no longer in the overbought zone, which gives it more room to rise further. But it’s not just about charts. The global economic scene is also improving. The U.S. and China have extended their tariff pause, and the U.S. has signed a trade deal with the EU. These moves could ease pressure on financial markets and bring fresh money into crypto. Because of this, many analysts now believe Bitcoin could rise to around $132,000 by October. Why October Matters for Bitcoin October has a strong track record for Bitcoin. In the past one decade, Bitcoin as posted positive returns in 8 of the last 10 Octobers . This trend, combined with macro support and regulatory clarity, is giving traders hope for another big move. Some analysts say this could be the moment BTC breaks out and enters a parabolic uptrend. Even prediction markets like Polymarket suggest a 78% chance that Bitcoin will touch $130,000, with a 48% chance of hitting $150,000 by year-end. Impact On Altcoins If Bitcoin runs up, altcoins are likely to follow. Ethereum has already crossed $3,800 and is aiming for $4,200 and beyond. BNB just reached new highs. XRP and other altcoins are also hitting its ATH price. MEanwhile, liquidity is now spreading across the market, which often happens during the early phase of a bull cycle. In the past, this kind of rotation led to altcoins jumping 2x to 5x after BTC’s rally. If history repeats, a similar move could be coming soon.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-bull-run-in-october-could-ignite-a-5x-altcoin-rally/,"BTC|TRADING|ALTCOIN|MARKET|ASIA","News",cryptocompare
2025-07-28T07:59:18,"Why SpacePay Is The Top Altcoin to Invest in for Hot Gains This Summer","The post Why SpacePay Is The Top Altcoin to Invest in for Hot Gains This Summer appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Everyone’s looking for the next big crypto opportunity this summer. Most projects talk a big game but deliver little substance. SpacePay does something different. This London startup lets businesses accept crypto payments through their existing card machines, converts everything to stable fiat currency instantly, and works with 325+ different wallets. They’ve pulled in over $1.2 million so far, and you can still grab $SPY tokens for $0.003181 each. Why SpacePay Works When Others Don’t Think about your local coffee shop or restaurant. The owner invested in a decent POS system that handles cards, tracks inventory, and manages sales. Now some crypto company wants them to buy another machine just for digital payments? That’s not realistic. SpacePay figured this out. Their software works with Android POS terminals that businesses already own. No new hardware needed. Just a software update and boom – the shop can accept payments from hundreds of different crypto wallets. The security side is pretty solid too. They use proper encryption and monitor transactions in real time. Nobody wants their payment system hacked, especially when dealing with irreversible crypto transactions. SpacePay seems to understand this concern. https://twitter.com/SpacePayLtd/status/1946903822778966418 This Altcoin Has The Lowest Fee Structure Around Let’s talk numbers for a minute. Credit card companies typically charge merchants 2.5% to 4% per transaction. That adds up fast for small businesses. If you’re running tight margins, those fees hurt. SpacePay charges 0.5%. That’s it. For a $100 sale, the merchant pays 50 cents instead of $3 or $4. Over a year, that difference could mean keeping the lights on or closing down. Other crypto payment solutions aren’t much better than traditional processors when it comes to fees. Some charge even more because they’re still figuring out their business model. SpacePay keeps it simple and affordable. Visit SpacePay Presale Smart Protection For Merchants Crypto prices jump around like crazy. Bitcoin can drop 10% in an hour. Ethereum might spike 15% overnight. That volatility terrifies business owners who need predictable income to pay rent and employees. SpacePay solves this problem in the most obvious way possible. When someone pays with crypto, the system immediately converts it to regular money. The merchant gets dollars, euros, or whatever currency they use. No price risk at all. This isn’t rocket science, but it’s exactly what businesses need. They want the benefits of accepting crypto without gambling on price movements. SpacePay delivers that stability while keeping everything simple. Understanding The Tokenomics Behind $SPY Most crypto projects create tokens just because they think they need them. The $SPY token serves real purposes in the SpacePay system. Token holders get voting rights on platform decisions. They receive monthly loyalty rewards. Plus, they earn a share of the company’s revenue. The total supply is capped at 34 billion tokens. Twenty percent goes to the public sale, which is happening now. The rest gets distributed for development, partnerships, marketing, and other business needs. Nothing too fancy, just a sensible allocation. Revenue sharing is probably the most interesting part. As SpacePay processes more transactions, token holders get paid. It’s like owning a tiny piece of the business. That creates real incentive to hold tokens long-term instead of just trading them. Breaking Down The Presale Structure The token price goes up at each stage of the presale. Early buyers get better prices than people who wait. Right now, tokens cost $0.003181 each. That price will increase as more people join. You can pay with major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Binance Coin. They also accept regular credit cards, which is handy if you don’t already own crypto. The whole process takes just a few minutes once you connect your wallet. SpacePay already built their core product and they’re working on regulatory compliance. That’s more progress than most crypto projects show during their fundraising phase. The team seems focused on building something that actually works rather than just hyping their token. Anyone can participate by visiting SpacePay’s official website and connecting a crypto wallet like MetaMask.

2025-07-28T07:53:25,"Trump Media and Technology Group sets aside $300M for BTC options strategy","Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) will extend its BTC operations, allocating $300M for options trading. The media group behind Truth Social will use the funds to acquire options linked to BTC-related securities in a complex derivative strategy. Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) will allocate $300M to acquire options linked to BTC-related securities. The new investment follows previous direct purchases of BTC and other crypto assets. The details of the deal are still unclear, but may be related to a more complex strategy of tracking BTC price fluctuations. Trump’s individual posting on social media has shown a clear effect on the price of BTC, with the added effect of World Liberty Fi. Options trading may tap the price fluctuations, though exposing the company to other types of risk. TMTG also benefitted from the past month’s crypto performance, as the share price rose by over 6% net. TMTG traded at $19.15 following the news. Trump Media Technology Group (TMTG) traded at $19.15 following the news of $300M allocated to BTC-related asset options trading. | Source: Google Finance . Options trading is seen as riskier, hinging on timing. However, Trump’s effect on the industry and general ties with other projects raise the issue of insider information and the potential for conflicts of interest. Trump Media and Technology Group breaks into active BTC trading The announcement by Trump Media and Technology Group follows the more liberal crypto regulation by the Trump administration. TMTG already has its own treasury strategy, reporting $2B in BTC and related assets, but so far it has been rare for corporations to take up an active trading approach to crypto. Digital assets have become key to the TMTG performance and by proxy for Trump’s net worth of $6.6B. Based on marker price estimates, Trump’s wealth has expanded by up to $620M in crypto over the past few months. World Liberty Fi alone holds over $216M in its known public wallets, with additional potential from the holdings of TMTG. The actual type of BTC-related securities remains uncertain. Currently, BTC exposure is possible through ETF, crypto company shares and preferred stock or convertible notes, as in the case of Strategy (MSTR). Options contracts may be risky if the market shifts its direction, letting the contracts expire without value. MSTR currently has one of the more active options markets , with a predominance of call options signaling a relatively bullish expectation. BTC options rely on direct bets on the price, with volumes growing to new records in 2025. Trump’s fund prepares for the impact of WLFI WLFI tokens, the voting asset of World Liberty Fi, is preparing to start trading. Currently, the asset only has pre-market price discovery, while full trading is expected in about six weeks. Pre-market trading has reached volumes up to $7M, giving the token a valuation of up to $79.4B . The asset is most active on MEXC, trading at around $0.29 in its pre-market pair, with the occasional price anomaly due to low volumes. Official Trump (TRUMP) has also recovered to $10.92 following the general crypto enthusiasm. Additionally, World Liberty Fi can rely on $2.2B of USD1 tokens, most active on BNB Smart Chain.

2025-07-28T07:53:12,"XRP Army Under Attack: 4 Reasons Scammers Keep Coming at Ripple","TL;DR The growth of the cryptocurrency market resulted in a skyrocketing number of scam attempts, many of which are highly successful for the bad actors. Ripple’s ecosystem is among the most targeted, and here are some of the possible reasons behind this. Brief Scam History and Recent Targets Cryptocurrency scams are nothing new, they have been employed by fraudsters for years. However, they tend to pick up in times when the market is going through the roof, as has been the case for the past several months. In general, the more attention people pay to crypto, the more it is expected that bad actors will search for victims. Arguably, the most utilized type of scam involves offering to double someone’s tokens by sending a certain amount to an address. As expected, the sender never receives the promised profit, nor even their initial funds. Of course, there are others, like Ponzi schemes, pump-and-dumps, and rug pulls, but the ones we will focus on in this article do not fall under that category, as they use an already established and well-known brand or a public figure to impersonate them and lure victims in. Throughout the years, many crypto projects and their communities have been targeted, with scams ranging from hacked Twitter accounts (at the time) promising free BTC to deep fakes of prominent figures such as Elon Musk, Charles Hoskinson, Changpeng Zhao, and Brad Garlinghouse. The last one, in fact, issued a vital warning for Ripple, its investors, and its community, earlier this month. Scammers used YouTube as their main platform to impersonate Ripple’s official account and executives to promote various frauds. XRP Army Under Attack: Why So? One of the possible reasons behind the scam attacks against Ripple and its community is its size – it’s one of the most vocal parts of the entire cryptocurrency space, while the native token has been in the top 10 and 5 digital assets for years. Currently, it’s the third-largest, with a market cap of close to $200 billion. This makes it a prime candidate to be exploited by bad actors. XRP holders are frequently expecting big news, such as partnership announcements with large banks, impactful updates like the ISO 20022 , spot ETF approvals in the States, or new developments on the legal case against the SEC, which started well over four years ago. This also opens the door for creative scams that could dupe investors with something like “Ripple wins SEC case – XRP airdrop now live, claim tokens here.” Speaking of giveaway scams, they are easy to create and promote on various social media channels. Fraudsters often use actual clips of real Ripple events or interviews to layer a fake giveaway – “send 1,000 XRP to this address and receive 2,000 XRP back.” These scams appear polished, typically run via livestream loops, and utilize XRP’s lower price ($3 compared to BTC’s $120,000 and ETH’s $4,000) to lure smaller investors into participating, with the hope of multiplying their holdings. The last possible reason is slightly related to the first, as it aims to capitalize on Ripple’s popularity. The company and its native token are frequently trending on platforms like Google, X, and YouTube, which allows scammers to exploit this search traffic by creating fake SEO-optimized videos, thumbnails, and livestreams. This concludes our article on why Ripple might be under constant fire, especially as its native token just charted a new all-time high. Investors should trust only the official channels of all projects they are interested in, not just Ripple, double- and triple-check everything before engaging with them, and beware that when something sounds too good to be true, it usually is.

2025-07-28T07:41:26,"2025’s Best Premium Cloud Mining Providers: Earn Reliable Passive Income from Cryptocurrency","Written by: Blockchain investment researcher / Crypto asset observer Introduction: Beyond Trading, “Hash Power” Emerges as the New Force in the Crypto Market In 2025, Bitcoin’s price surged past $128,000. With the implementation of the MiCA regulations in Europe and the inclusion of digital assets in U.S. pension plans (like 401(k)s), the market is entering a new phase of compliance and mainstream adoption. Traditional investment strategies—often driven by speculation and volatility—are falling out of favor. Instead, investors are increasingly turning toward more stable, secure, and long-term income-generating methods. At this point, cloud mining has emerged as a new gateway for mainstream asset allocation. Users don’t need to purchase mining machines or handle technical setups. Instead, by renting computing power from a compliant platform, they can remotely participate in cryptocurrency mining and earn real daily returns. Especially those platforms that combine AI-based allocation and green energy are becoming the top choice for building reliable “digital cash flows.” What Is Cloud Mining? How Can You Earn Crypto on Your Phone Through It? Cloud mining is a method of cryptocurrency mining that doesn’t require users to purchase or manage mining hardware themselves. Instead, it leases computing power from large-scale mining farms through online contracts. Users simply select a mining plan online and can remotely mine major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum Classic, or Litecoin—receiving daily payouts. Compared to traditional local mining, cloud mining’s biggest advantage is that it eliminates the need for any hardware purchases, electricity costs, or technical maintenance. Today, many mainstream cloud mining platforms (such as MiningToken ) offer dedicated mobile apps, allowing users to register, choose a contract, track earnings in real time, and even withdraw automatically—making it truly possible to “earn crypto from your phone.” Advantages of Cloud Mining: Zero Hardware Costs – Start Mining from Your Phone: No need for mining rigs, electricity setups, or wiring. Simply register an account to start mining with one click. Low Barrier to Entry – No Technical Knowledge Required: Even beginners without blockchain or programming experience can get started easily. Daily Automatic Earnings: Platforms calculate daily mining rewards based on contracts and support mainstream cryptocurrencies such as BTC, USDT, and ETC, with real-time payout. Short-Term Contracts with Flexible Exit Options: Many platforms offer short contracts (1, 3, or 5 days), making it easy to test the waters or adjust strategies without locking up funds long-term. Powered by Green Energy and AI: Leading platforms often integrate AI-based computing allocation with renewable energy sources (like hydropower and geothermal), maximizing profitability while remaining environmentally friendly. In Summary: Cloud mining offers a device-free, low-maintenance way to invest in cryptocurrencies with controllable returns. Especially at the beginning of a bull market and under clear regulatory conditions, choosing a legal and transparent platform can be a key step in building a stream of passive crypto income. MiningToken — Swiss-Based, AI Optimization + Clean Energy Integration MiningToken has become one of the top-performing cloud mining platforms in 2025. Headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland, it complies with local financial and energy regulations. The platform uses an AI-powered computing allocation system to identify the most profitable cryptocurrencies at any given time (e.g., BTC, ETC, DOGE), helping users maximize daily returns. All mining operations are powered by renewable energy sources, such as geothermal power in Iceland and hydropower in Norway. Users can choose short-term flexible contracts ranging from 1 to 5 days, which are ideal for quick returns and low-entry strategies. MiningToken also supports multi-coin mining and automatic reward conversion, making it an excellent starting point for building a passive income portfolio.

2025-07-28T07:30:10,"Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Fuels H100 Group’s Astounding $11.46M Funding Success","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Fuels H100 Group’s Astounding $11.46M Funding Success In the dynamic world where cutting-edge technology meets strategic finance, the H100 Group, a prominent Swedish health-tech firm, has made headlines with its latest funding announcement. The company recently completed a directed share issue, successfully raising approximately SEK 109.19 million, equivalent to a remarkable $11.46 million. What makes this achievement particularly compelling for the crypto community is H100 Group’s pioneering adoption of a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy , a move that has significantly shaped its financial trajectory. Unpacking H100 Group’s Strategic Bitcoin Treasury Strategy For those new to the concept, a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy involves a company holding Bitcoin as a reserve asset on its balance sheet, much like it would traditional fiat currencies or gold. This strategic shift is gaining traction among forward-thinking corporations looking to diversify their assets, hedge against inflation, and align with the burgeoning digital economy. H100 Group has not just dipped its toes but has fully embraced this innovative approach, demonstrating a profound belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. The decision to implement a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy is often driven by several factors: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s finite supply makes it an attractive hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset to the treasury can reduce overall portfolio risk. Innovation Alignment: For tech companies, embracing digital assets signals a commitment to innovation and future-forward thinking. Potential for Appreciation: While volatile, Bitcoin has historically shown significant long-term growth potential. H100 Group’s commitment to this strategy highlights a growing trend where companies are not just observing the crypto space but actively participating in it, integrating digital assets into their core financial operations. The Astounding $11.46 Million Funding Round: A Testament to Vision? The recent share issue, announced by H100 Group on X (formerly Twitter), represents a significant milestone. Raising $11.46 million in a single round is impressive for any firm, but for one openly leveraging a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy , it sends a powerful message to both traditional investors and the crypto market. This latest funding round brings H100 Group’s total gross proceeds since launching its Bitcoin Treasury Strategy to approximately SEK 1.095 billion, which translates to a staggering $114 million. This cumulative figure underscores the substantial financial growth and investor confidence the company has garnered through its unconventional yet strategic financial management. What does this mean for H100 Group? This fresh capital infusion will undoubtedly fuel their health-tech innovations, enabling them to expand their research and development, scale their operations, and reach a broader market. It validates their strategic financial decisions and positions them as a leader not just in health-tech but also in corporate financial innovation. Why are More Companies Adopting a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy? H100 Group is not alone in its embrace of Bitcoin. Companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla have famously adopted similar strategies, albeit on different scales. The rationale behind this trend is multifaceted: Benefit Description Potential Impact Inflation Hedge Protection against purchasing power erosion of fiat currencies. Preserves capital value over time. Balance Sheet Diversification Adding a non-traditional asset to reduce overall portfolio risk. Improved risk-adjusted returns. Innovation & Future-Proofing Signaling adaptability and forward-thinking in a digital age. Attracts tech-savvy talent and investors. Potential for Appreciation Exposure to a high-growth asset class. Significant capital gains if Bitcoin’s value increases. However, adopting a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy is not without its challenges. The inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies, regulatory uncertainties, and the need for robust security protocols are significant considerations. Companies must conduct thorough due diligence and implement sophisticated risk management frameworks to navigate these complexities effectively. H100 Group’s Journey: Pioneering Health-Tech with a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy? H100 Group’s core business lies in health-tech, a sector ripe for innovation. Their ability to secure substantial funding, partly attributed to their forward-looking financial strategy, allows them to accelerate their mission. Imagine the impact of this capital on developing new diagnostic tools, improving patient care platforms, or expanding access to healthcare services through technology. Their journey serves as an intriguing case study. It demonstrates that a company’s financial strategy can be as innovative as its core product. By integrating a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy , H100 Group has potentially opened new avenues for capital generation and investor interest, setting a precedent for other health-tech or traditional firms contemplating similar moves. Navigating the Future: Opportunities and Obstacles for the Bitcoin Treasury Strategy The path for corporate adoption of Bitcoin is still evolving. While H100 Group’s success is a positive indicator, the broader landscape presents both immense opportunities and considerable obstacles. Regulatory clarity, institutional infrastructure, and market stability will continue to shape how widely the Bitcoin Treasury Strategy is embraced. The ongoing debate about Bitcoin’s role as a store of value versus a speculative asset will influence corporate decisions. However, as the digital asset ecosystem matures, and as more companies like H100 Group demonstrate the viability and benefits of such strategies, we may see a significant shift in corporate finance paradigms. For investors, H100 Group’s story offers a glimpse into companies that are not afraid to innovate beyond their primary business. It underscores the importance of looking at a company’s holistic strategy, including its approach to treasury management, when assessing its long-term potential. Conclusion H100 Group’s success in raising $11.46 million, and a cumulative $114 million, since adopting its Bitcoin Treasury Strategy is more than just a financial milestone; it’s a powerful testament to the evolving landscape of corporate finance. This Swedish health-tech firm is demonstrating that strategic foresight, coupled with a willingness to embrace innovative financial instruments like Bitcoin, can unlock significant capital and drive growth. As the digital economy continues to expand, H100 Group stands out as a compelling example of how traditional sectors can integrate with the future of finance, paving the way for a new era of corporate treasury management. Their journey highlights the growing confidence in Bitcoin as a legitimate and valuable asset for institutional holdings, setting a precedent for other companies to explore the potential of a diversified, crypto-inclusive financial strategy.

2025-07-28T07:23:24,"Here is the Bitcoin Price Level That Could be an Attractive Entry Point for BTC Bulls","As bitcoin (BTC) holds near its record highs, traders looking to join the uptrend may be facing a dilemma: should they enter now, or wait for a more favorable pullback? According to Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research , a pullback to the former resistance-turned-support level of the May high, under $112,000, would be the best entry point. ""We would prefer to see bitcoin retest its $111,673 breakout level to provide a more favorable risk/reward entry point,"" Thielen said in a note to clients Monday. The risk-reward ratio compares the potential loss of an investment to its potential profit, helping traders determine whether the potential gains justify the associated risks. Traders typically target a risk-reward ratio of at least 1:2, necessitating bullish entries close to key support levels, like the $111,673 in BTC's case. It's common for markets to revisit the breakout points before staging bigger bull runs, meaning a potential pullback to $111,673 cannot be ruled out. As of writing, BTC traded flat at around $119,500, having risen over 1% on Sunday amid reports that the U.S. had reached the largest-ever trade deal with the European Union. But what if the meaningful pullback doesn't unfold? In that case, the best entry would be above $120,000, marking a breakout above the trendline connecting July 14 and July 23 highs. ""A break above the descending trendline, particularly a sustained move above $120,000, could justify re-engaging with the trend, though it would warrant unusually tight stop-losses,"" Thielen said.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/28/here-is-the-bitcoin-price-level-that-could-be-an-attractive-entry-point-for-btc-bulls,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|ZRX|BUSINESS","Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|News",cryptocompare

2025-07-28T07:08:00,"Trump Media Invests $300M on Options Tied to Bitcoin-Related Securities: Report","Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), the company behind Donald Trump’s Truth Social platform, has made a $300 million investment in options linked to Bitcoin-related securities. Key Takeaways: Trump Media has invested $300M in options tied to Bitcoin-related assets. The strategy aims to profit from crypto price swings without holding Bitcoin directly. Timing is crucial, as options offer high reward but carry significant risk. While specific details of the investment remain limited, the move signals a shift in strategy as Trump Media appears to be positioning itself to benefit from fluctuations in Bitcoin prices, according to a Bloomberg report . The company, which is closely tied to Trump’s public presence, may be seeking to amplify its market exposure by leveraging price volatility through derivatives rather than holding the digital asset directly. Timing Is Everything in Trump Media’s Bitcoin Options Bet Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, noted the timing of this strategy is critical. “It adds a timing and price element that doesn’t exist if you just own the underlying asset,” he said, pointing out that options allow for higher potential returns, but with increased risk. Bitcoin-linked securities can include exchange-traded funds (ETFs), shares in crypto firms, or convertible notes from companies like MicroStrategy. Options tied to these assets offer leveraged exposure, but if the strike price isn’t reached before expiry, they can become worthless. TMTG declined to comment. A White House spokesperson told Bloomberg that the president “has never engaged in, and never will engage in, any conflict of interest.” The decision may also tie into Trump’s personal influence over crypto markets. His posts on Truth Social have previously driven price surges. In March, a post claiming the US should consider a reserve asset composed of cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin and Ethereum coincided with a jump in digital asset prices. TMTG’s crypto exposure isn’t new. The company already holds an estimated $2 billion in Bitcoin and related assets, but actively trading options marks a rare approach among public firms. The strategy opens up the possibility of generating profits during sharp price swings while exposing the firm to potentially large losses if the market moves the other way. Trump Media raises $2.44B for a corporate Bitcoin treasury, positioning itself among the top global corporate BTC holders. #Bitcoin #TrumpMedia https://t.co/1ZgY78WNTN — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 30, 2025 Trump’s Crypto Holdings Make Up Key Portion of His Fortune Trump’s crypto-linked holdings are also a substantial part of his personal wealth . Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index estimates that TMTG stock represents $2.2 billion of Trump’s $6.6 billion fortune. His broader cryptocurrency investments are believed to have gained at least $620 million in recent months. However, the move is raising concerns among some industry figures. Nick Carter, general partner at Castle Island Ventures and a Trump supporter, said the overlap between Trump’s political influence and his financial exposure to crypto markets could create a conflict of interest. “It’s always a headache to have businesses with conflicting interests,” he told Bloomberg. As reported, nearly 70 nominees and officials in the Trump administration reportedly hold crypto or investments in blockchain companies , with holdings ranging from modest sums to over $120 million. The group includes Vice President JD Vance and seven Cabinet members or nominees, who collectively disclosed at least $2 million in crypto assets. Critics warn that this creates potential conflicts of interest and normalizes risky crypto investments among public servants.

2025-07-28T07:04:32,"JPMorgan Chase Warns ‘Shadows of 2007’ Brewing Amid Meme Stock Mania – Why the Bank Is Staying Bullish","Banking giant JPMorgan Chase warns that a maturing market could pose a systemic risk capable of triggering a meltdown reminiscent of the 2007 Global Financial Crisis. In a new interview on CNBC, Bill Eigen, the CIO of JPMorgan Asset Management’s absolute fixed income division, says there’s a speculative fever spreading throughout markets, as evidenced by the hot crypto and meme stock markets. He also warns that the private credit market looks to be following in the footsteps of subprime mortgage-backed securities (MBS) over 20 years ago. Subprime MBS are stacked with housing loans given to high-risk borrowers with poor credit and were marked safe by credit ratings agencies, allowing institutions to invest heavily in the asset class. When the borrowers started to default en masse, MBS prices collapsed and institutions with billions of dollars in exposure imploded. Eigen sees a similar pattern repeating in the private credit market. The JPMorgan executive says private credit, or loans given by non-bank lenders such as hedge funds to riskier borrowers like small companies, are highly illiquid assets that are hard to sell because they don’t trade in the public markets. He notes that there’s now a “big push” for these assets to be sold in public vehicles that would expose institutions to stacks of loans given to riskier borrowers. “Boy, you know what, I’m getting shadows of ’07 a little bit. Not to the extent of back then, but the thing I’m nervous about is that there’s this big push to put private assets in mutual funds, ETFs (exchange-traded funds) and things like that – things that trade by appointment and putting them in vehicles that trade by the second. Whenever I start to see things like that, I just personally get a little bit nervous… This huge push to take illiquid assets and [make them liquid or semi-liquid]. Some of these things trade by appointment, there’s a lot private credit out there that should not be trading at par value but that’s where it’s marked… You remember what happened back in the day, the ABX index (subprime MBS) and taking illiquid mortgages and putting them in liquid vehicles and the rest is history.” But for now, JPMorgan Chase is staying bullish on the stock market, noting that the Trump administration is doing everything it can to “turbocharge” the economy and get equities higher.

2025-07-28T07:00:01,"Bitcoin Short Squeeze Incoming As Market Makers Set Trap To Go Above $123,000","After a tumultuous week, the Bitcoin price is starting to find its footing again, rising from major support around the $115,000 level. Currently, the pioneer cryptocurrency looks to be on the path of recovery and possibly moving toward new highs this week as momentum picks up. There is also the possibility of a coming short squeeze, as explained by crypto analyst Luca on X, using recent developments that show that the recent crash may have only been temporary. Bitcoin Shows Tendency To Cross $123,000 Again In an X post, Luca pointed to the Bitcoin market makers as the ones behind the recent price movements and that there was a reason for this. The initial move downward looked to be an attempt to flush out late longs as crypto traders tried to take advantage of the frenzy created by the new all-time highs. Related Reading: Ripple CEO Sounds Alarm: If You’re An XRP Investor, You Should See This Then a reversal moved into the works, catching shorters unaware and sweeping liquidity at support levels. This comes as bears were pulled into a false sense of security, believing that the price would continue to decline before being hit with the move back up above $118,000, triggering hundreds of millions of dollars in liquidations. All of this is happening at a time when things like the Bitcoin funding rate were falling. Coinglass data shows the Bitcoin OI-Weighted Funding Rate had fallen briefly below 0.01% on Sunday after reaching as high as 0.0167% earlier in the week on July 23. Luca further revealed that the Bitcoin Premium metric had also fallen back into the negative. Another interesting fact was the fact that the open interest had shot up when the Bitcoin price had declined. Then, once the price began to recover, the open interest began to rise once again, and Luca interprets this as short positions starting to get squeezed. If this squeeze continues, then the Bitcoin price could spike very quickly, taking out tens of thousands of short positions with it. Related Reading: Bitcoin Eyes Bounce off This Support Level In Reversal Campaign For $121,000 BTC Open Interest Tells A Story Of Exposure As the Bitcoin price has bounced between $115,000 and $120,000, the BTC open interest has barreled upwards in response. In fact, this metric sits at all-time high levels, shaking off the market uncertainty as crypto traders continue to open positions to bet on Bitcoin’s next move. The open interest had touched $87.89 billion back on July 15, and since then, it has averaged above $80 billion every day. Amid this, the Binance Long/Short ratio shows that shorters are currently dominating at 53.97% compared to 46.03% for long accounts. This lends credence to Luca’s expectations that the market could see a short squeeze to take out shorters and push the price to new all-time highs.
