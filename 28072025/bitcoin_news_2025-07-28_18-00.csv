2025-07-28T15:56:23,"Trump Backs U.S. Crypto Boom: ‚ÄúBitcoin Is Great for Our Country‚Äù","The post Trump Backs U.S. Crypto Boom: ‚ÄúBitcoin Is Great for Our Country‚Äù appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin has been breaking new highs lately and President Donald Trump is all in. Once unsure about crypto, he now calls it ‚Äúamazing‚Äù and sees it as a big win for the U.S. economy. His latest remarks reveal how deeply he and his family are tied to Bitcoin‚Äôs future. Bitcoin Is Boosting Jobs and Economy In a recent White House press conference, President Trump reflected on his evolving view of Bitcoin and its growing role in the U.S. economy. TRUMP: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs (Bitcoin) become amazing‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs a great thing for our country.‚Äù pic.twitter.com/qo3N2QVJyD ‚Äî Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) July 28, 2025 Trump observed that more people are now using Bitcoin for payments, and noted that this trend eases pressure on the U.S. dollar which can be a positive thing for the country. He revealed that he personally invested in Bitcoin before becoming president and that his children are also involved. He also pointed out how Bitcoin held up better than the stock market recently. Trump said he helped build what he called a ‚Äúvery powerful‚Äù crypto industry in the U.S., saying things moved slowly under the Biden administration. As a President, he emphasized that his priority is helping build a strong and vital industry. He added that if the U.S. had not embraced it, China likely would have taken the lead. The Trump Family and Crypto At the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas in May, the Trump sons advocated for pro-crypto regulation along with Vice President J.D. Vance, urging a government-friendly environment for digital assets. They also predicted Bitcoin prices at between $150K‚Äì$175K by 2026. Eric Trump has also said that Ethereum is undervalued and should already be trading above $8,000. Inside Trump Media‚Äôs Crypto Portfolio Trump Media now holds $2 billion Bitcoin , making up most of its liquid assets and pushing Trump‚Äôs stake to $2.3 billion. According to a latest report from Bloomberg, Trump Media, linked to President Donald Trump, has invested $300 million into Bitcoin-related derivatives. By adding derivatives tied to ETFs, blockchain stocks, and convertible bonds, the company is doubling down on crypto. Trump has pushed the U.S. to become a global crypto leader, creating a ‚Äústrategic bitcoin reserve,‚Äù appointing a crypto czar, and signing the bipartisan GENIUS Act into law last week. Trump Defends Crypto Push as Strategic Move Trump‚Äôs family also controls the decentralized finance firm World Liberty Financial, which has already made $500 million since launching in 2024. Critics say that Trump‚Äôs policies could directly benefit his crypto holdings, despite them being in a trust managed by his son. With Bitcoin now over $120,000, Trump Media says its big crypto stash gives it financial freedom, and it plans to launch a utility token linked to Truth Social soon. Bitcoin is currently trading at $118,065, down 0.3% in the last 24 hours.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/uncategorized/trump-backs-u-s-crypto-boom-bitcoin-is-great-for-our-country/,"BTC|REGULATION|MARKET|TRADING|ASIA","Uncategorized|Bitcoin|Crypto news",cryptocompare

2025-07-28T15:51:27,"PayPal enables US merchants to accept over 100 cryptos","The US payments giant, PayPal, has rolled out a new payment feature that allows small businesses to accept more than 100 cryptocurrencies. This i ncorporates leading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. More unconventional tokens, such as Trump‚Äôs meme coin and the novelty coin Fartcoin, will be included, too. A spokesperson confirmed that the option is available to any US merchant using the company‚Äôs online payment platform. To attract early adoption, PayPal will charge merchants a promotional transaction fee of 0.99% during the first year, which will rise to 1.5% later. According to the Nilson Report, these rates still undercut the 1.57% average fee paid by US businesses to credit card networks in 2024. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a worldview where you can imagine that the world is moving on chain,‚Äù said Frank Keller, PayPal‚Äôs executive vice president. ‚ÄúIs that happening overnight? No. Some say it‚Äôll take a long time, others say it‚Äôll happen quickly. I think we will see movement.‚Äù PayPal streamlines crypto checkout with wallet integration and instant conversions The payment process will allow customers to connect their existing crypto wallets at checkout. Depending on the wallet, PayPal will facilitate a crypto sale via centralized exchanges like Coinbase or decentralized ones like Uniswap. The proceeds will be converted first into PayPal‚Äôs stablecoin, PYUSD, and then into US dollars for the merchant. CEO Alex Chriss illustrated the platform‚Äôs global reach by describing how a shopper in Guatemala could use crypto to buy a gift from a merchant in Oklahoma City, which was made possible through the company‚Äôs open platform. This development is the firm‚Äôs latest effort to deepen its presence in the digital asset space. The company first enabled crypto trading for US users in 2020, later extending the service to Venmo. PayPal reignites crypto push as market recovers and political support grows During the 2022 ‚Äúcrypto winter,‚Äù PayPal scaled back its crypto messaging. However, with the market rebounding and growing political support for digital assets under President Donald Trump‚Äôs administration, the firm is ramping up again. The company intends to expand the ability for merchants to accept crypto to larger enterprise customers in the US and globally; however, a spokesperson declined to provide a timeline. According to PayPal, this move taps into a $3 trillion crypto market and provides access to more than 650 million crypto wallet holders worldwide. The platform also facilitates near-instant settlements by converting crypto to PYUSD and then fiat, drastically reducing the time and costs of international bank transfers. PayPal‚Äôs platform handles everything from KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) checks to fraud prevention and chargeback management. This means merchants can accept crypto without having to contend with the risks and complexity of the base blockchain. PYUSD, which rolled out in 2023 and is issued by Paxos , a regulated trust company, also provides another layer of compliance. The stablecoin‚Äôs market cap is up nearly 70% to $850 million since the beginning of 2025, according to CoinGecko. PayPal‚Äôs new offering puts it ahead of other fintech rivals in the crypto space. Though Block (formerly Square) and Stripe have each integrated crypto payments in some form, PayPal‚Äôs end-to-end experience integrating a wallet, exchange routing, a stablecoin, and fiat conversion is arguably the most comprehensive offering. Trump has framed his administration as a hard pivot away from the policies of former President Joe Biden, who took a more aggressive approach to investigating cryptocurrency-linked enterprises.

Notably, the crypto market has picked up serious momentum in recent weeks. On July 22, the total market cap hit a record high of $3.94 trillion.¬†Altcoin Season Heating UpAlthough the market briefly dipped to $3.7 trillion between July 23 and 25, bulls quickly stepped in, triggering a rebound that pushed the valuation back to $3.86 trillion. With this pace, the $4 trillion milestone now sits within reach.While Bitcoin played a major part in driving this growth, altcoins have taken on a bigger role lately. Remarkably, Ethereum (ETH) led the charge , and its growing influence has led to growing talk of a full-blown altcoin season.¬†As altcoins continue to gain ground, the Bitcoin dominance has dropped significantly. After peaking at 66% in late June, Bitcoin's share of the market now sits at 61%, a level last seen in early March. This shows that more traders are rotating their capital into alternative assets.Bitcoin Dominance Could Drop FurtherNotably, market veteran Micha√´l Van de Poppe recently discussed this change using a 3-day Bitcoin dominance chart.¬†He pointed to a strong bearish divergence, where Bitcoin dominance kept making higher highs from mid-May to late June, but the RSI (Relative Strength Index) printed lower highs. This contrast usually signals weakness in the trend and hints at an incoming reversal. This reversal occurred in late June, leading to the recent drop in Bitcoin dominance. Bitcoin Dominance Drop Allowing for Altcoin Season However, Van de Poppe noted that the Bitcoin dominance could record further declines, allowing altcoins to gain more dominance in the coming days. Nonetheless, he admitted that BTC price might still see brief bursts of strength, which could cause altcoins to pull back temporarily.¬†Despite this, he stressed that the broader trend has already turned. The drop from the 66% dominance peak confirms this change in trend. Van de Poppe's analysis suggests that altcoins are set to take the lead in the next chapter of this market cycle.Altcoin Market Adds $361B in JulyMeanwhile, the altcoin market cap (the TOTAL2 index) continues to grow. In July alone, the market added a massive $361 billion. Ethereum contributed $160 billion to that figure, showing just how much capital flowed into the network.¬†XRP, the second-largest altcoin by market value, added $56 billion. Solana (SOL) brought in $18.64 billion, and BNB (BNB) jumped by $24.31 billion, as it hit new all-time highs in price.Ethereum now aims to reclaim the $4,000 level. Notably, it came close recently by reaching $3,940 before pulling back slightly to $3,810. XRP also eyes a new all-time high above $4. It currently trades at $3.17, about 26% below that mark.Meanwhile, trader Niels, co-founder of Ted Labs, explained in an analysis today that the altcoin market has just reclaimed an eight-year trendline and turned it into support. Altcoin Market Cap | Niels After successfully retesting that line, the market now looks ready to climb higher, allowing for a full-blown altcoin season . He believes this is the perfect window to start building altcoin positions, predicting strong returns within the next four to six months.Further, Glassnode also discussed the derivatives market around altcoins. The firm reported a sharp rebound in open interest (OI) across Ethereum, XRP, and Solana futures after the brief weekend dip.¬†https://twitter.com/glassnode/status/1949834478227976443Specifically, combined OI climbed to $44.2 billion, just shy of last week's high of $45 billion.

2025-07-28T15:25:10,"Bitcoin: Why Ray Dalio‚Äôs Bold 15% Gold & Crypto Allocation Could Safeguard Your Wealth","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin: Why Ray Dalio‚Äôs Bold 15% Gold & Crypto Allocation Could Safeguard Your Wealth The financial world often buzzes with insights from legendary investors, and few command as much attention as Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates. When Dalio speaks, the investment community listens. His recent suggestion for investors to allocate a significant portion‚Äîat least 15%‚Äîof their portfolios to both gold and Bitcoin has sent ripples through traditional and crypto markets alike. This isn‚Äôt just a casual tip; it‚Äôs a strategic recommendation aimed at safeguarding wealth against a backdrop of escalating macroeconomic risks, particularly the burgeoning global government debt. But why this specific allocation, and what makes Bitcoin , a relatively young asset, stand alongside the age-old safe haven of gold? Understanding Ray Dalio‚Äôs Vision for Bitcoin Ray Dalio, a titan in the investment world, is renowned for his pragmatic, data-driven approach to markets. His firm, Bridgewater Associates, manages vast sums and is known for its ‚Äúall-weather‚Äù portfolio strategy, designed to perform well in various economic climates. Initially skeptical, Dalio‚Äôs perspective on Bitcoin has evolved. As Decrypt reported, his current stance reflects deep concern over the global economic trajectory, marked by unprecedented government spending, increasing debt, and continuous fiat money printing. Dalio views gold as a timeless store of value, a ‚Äúbarbarous relic‚Äù perhaps, but one that has consistently protected wealth through centuries of economic upheaval. His embrace of Bitcoin , however, signals a recognition of its emerging role as ‚Äúdigital gold‚Äù ‚Äì a decentralized, finite asset that exists outside the control of any government or central bank. This makes it an attractive hedge against currency debasement and inflation, similar to gold but with unique digital properties. The 15% allocation is a strategic percentage, providing meaningful protection against systemic risks without overwhelming a diversified portfolio. For Dalio, it‚Äôs about creating a balanced defense against a potentially perilous future for traditional currencies and bonds, emphasizing diversification into non-debt-based assets that are less susceptible to governmental fiscal policies. Gold vs. Bitcoin: The Dual Hedge Against Uncertainty When considering portfolio hedges, gold has long been the undisputed champion. But in the digital age, Bitcoin has emerged as a formidable contender, leading many to ask: why not both? Dalio‚Äôs recommendation leverages the unique strengths of each asset, creating a powerful dual hedge. Gold‚Äôs Enduring Appeal: Historical Store of Value: Gold has preserved wealth for millennia, acting as a reliable safe haven during economic crises and geopolitical turmoil. Inflation Hedge: Its limited supply and intrinsic value make it a traditional shield against the erosion of purchasing power. Tangible Asset: Unlike digital currencies, gold is a physical asset, offering a sense of security and tangibility. The Rise of Bitcoin: Digital Scarcity: With a hard cap of 21 million coins, Bitcoin is even scarcer than gold, making it deflationary by design. Decentralization: Operating on a peer-to-peer network, it‚Äôs free from government control, censorship, or seizure. Global Accessibility: Easily transferable across borders, 24/7, with relatively low transaction costs compared to traditional finance. High Growth Potential: As a nascent asset class, it offers significant upside potential as adoption grows. The synergy between gold and Bitcoin is compelling. Gold provides the stability of a time-tested asset, while Bitcoin offers the potential for exponential growth and a hedge against a purely digital future where traditional financial systems might face unprecedented challenges. Together, they offer a comprehensive defense strategy for your portfolio. Comparison: Gold vs. Bitcoin as Portfolio Hedges Feature Gold Bitcoin Supply Limited, but new supply mined continually Absolutely finite (21 million coins) Volatility Relatively low High History as Store of Value Thousands of years Just over a decade Decentralization Market-driven, but physical control can be centralized Fully decentralized blockchain network Portability Difficult for large amounts Easy (digital) Navigating Macroeconomic Headwinds with Strategic Bitcoin Allocation The global economy faces unprecedented challenges. Enormous government debts, fueled by expansive fiscal policies and quantitative easing, risk inflation and currency devaluation. In this environment, traditional investments like cash and bonds can see their real value eroded. This is precisely where Dalio‚Äôs advice becomes critical. By allocating a portion of your portfolio to assets like gold and Bitcoin , you are essentially purchasing an ‚Äúinsurance policy‚Äù against these systemic risks. These assets tend to perform well when confidence in fiat currencies wanes or when inflation surges. Protection Against Inflation: As more money is printed, the purchasing power of each unit decreases. Gold and Bitcoin , with their limited or finite supplies, offer a hedge against this erosion. Diversification from Traditional Assets: Their low correlation with stocks and bonds means they can provide stability during market downturns, acting as a true diversifier. Hedge Against Geopolitical Instability: In times of international conflict or economic sanctions, non-sovereign assets like Bitcoin can become crucial for wealth preservation and transfer. Given current economic conditions‚Äîrising interest rates, persistent inflation, and geopolitical tensions‚Äîincluding these alternative assets in a balanced portfolio is increasingly vital. Dalio‚Äôs recommendation highlights that old investment rules may no longer fully apply in this complex global landscape. Potential Challenges and Wise Considerations for Your Bitcoin Portfolio While the allure of gold and Bitcoin as hedges is strong, it‚Äôs crucial to approach any investment with a clear understanding of its inherent risks. Bitcoin , in particular, comes with its own set of challenges that investors must consider before diving in. Volatility: Bitcoin is famous for its dramatic price swings. While this offers significant upside potential, it also means substantial downside risk. Investors must be prepared for periods of sharp declines. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Potential new regulations could impact Bitcoin ‚Äòs price, accessibility, and utility. Security Risks: Storing Bitcoin requires careful attention to security. Hacks on exchanges, phishing scams, or losing private keys can result in irreversible loss of funds. Proper custody solutions (e.g., hardware wallets) are essential. Technological Complexity: For newcomers, understanding the underlying technology, wallets, and exchanges can be daunting. A lack of understanding can lead to mistakes. Market Manipulation: The crypto market is still relatively small compared to traditional markets, making it potentially more susceptible to large price movements influenced by whales or market sentiment. It‚Äôs vital to remember that Dalio‚Äôs advice is part of a broader, diversified strategy. A 15% allocation is significant, but it‚Äôs not an all-in bet. Investors should conduct their own thorough research and assess their personal risk tolerance before making any investment decisions. Implementing Ray Dalio‚Äôs Insights: Your Path to a Resilient Portfolio So, how does an average investor practically implement Dalio‚Äôs strategic allocation? It‚Äôs not about blindly following a percentage, but understanding the underlying principles and adapting them to your personal financial situation and risk appetite. Actionable Steps: Assess Your Current Portfolio: Understand your existing asset allocation, risk exposure, and long-term financial goals. Determine Your Allocation Split: Dalio suggests 15% for gold and Bitcoin combined, but adjust this split based on your conviction and risk tolerance (e.g., 7.5% gold/7.5% Bitcoin , or 10% gold/5% Bitcoin for more conservative approaches). Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of investing the entire amount at once, consider investing a fixed amount regularly (e.g., weekly or monthly). This strategy helps mitigate the impact of volatility by averaging out your purchase price over time. Choose Reputable Platforms: For gold, consider physical gold, gold ETFs, or reputable gold investment platforms. For Bitcoin , use established and secure cryptocurrency exchanges or brokers. Prioritize Security: If you opt for self-custody of your Bitcoin , invest in a hardware wallet and learn best practices for securing your private keys. Rebalance Periodically: Review your portfolio regularly (e.g., quarterly or annually) and rebalance to maintain your target allocation. If Bitcoin ‚Äòs value surges, trim some to restore your desired percentage. Consult a Financial Advisor: Especially if you‚Äôre new to these assets or have a complex financial situation, a qualified financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your needs. Remember, the goal is to build a resilient portfolio that can withstand various economic conditions. Dalio‚Äôs advice serves as a powerful reminder that adapting to changing macroeconomic landscapes requires forward-thinking strategies and a willingness to embrace new forms of wealth preservation. Ray Dalio‚Äôs recommendation for a 15% portfolio allocation to gold and Bitcoin is a profound statement on global finance. It highlights growing concerns among investors about fiat currency stability and rising government debt. By embracing both the ancient hedge of gold and the revolutionary potential of Bitcoin , investors can build a more resilient, diversified portfolio for future uncertainties. This strategic allocation is not just about returns; it‚Äôs about preserving wealth and securing financial well-being in an increasingly complex world. Dalio‚Äôs wisdom guides us to think beyond conventional boundaries and adopt a robust investment approach. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is Ray Dalio‚Äôs main reason for recommending gold and Bitcoin? Ray Dalio recommends gold and Bitcoin primarily as hedges against rising macroeconomic risks, particularly the increasing global government debt and the potential for currency debasement due to excessive money printing. He sees them as non-debt-based assets that can preserve purchasing power. 2. How does Bitcoin compare to gold as a store of value? Both are considered stores of value due to their scarcity. Gold has a multi-millennia history, offering stability and tangibility. Bitcoin , often called ‚Äúdigital gold,‚Äù is newer but offers absolute scarcity (21 million coin cap), decentralization, and ease of digital transfer. They complement each other, with gold providing traditional stability and Bitcoin offering modern, digital resilience. 3. Is 15% a fixed allocation, or can it vary? The 15% is a general recommendation from Ray Dalio. The actual allocation can and should vary based on an individual‚Äôs personal financial situation, risk tolerance, investment horizon, and conviction in each asset. Some might prefer a higher gold allocation, while others, more comfortable with crypto‚Äôs volatility, might lean more towards Bitcoin . 4. What are the main risks of investing in Bitcoin? Key risks include high price volatility, which can lead to significant losses; evolving and uncertain regulatory landscapes; security concerns related to digital asset storage and exchanges; and the technological complexity for new users. It‚Äôs crucial to understand these risks before investing. 5. Should I sell other assets to buy gold and Bitcoin? Not necessarily. Dalio‚Äôs recommendation is about strategic diversification and rebalancing, not necessarily selling off your entire existing portfolio. It‚Äôs advisable to assess your current asset allocation and gradually adjust to incorporate gold and Bitcoin , potentially through new investments or by reallocating a small portion of existing holdings that align with your risk profile.

2025-07-28T15:14:06,"IBIT: A Simple Way To Play Bitcoin","Summary IBIT is the largest Bitcoin ETF in the market, offering easy access to Bitcoin‚Äôs upside amid favorable regulatory changes and market optimism. Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance and recent all-time highs, fueled by supportive GENIUS Act legislation, make IBIT a compelling vehicle for cryptocurrency exposure. IBIT‚Äôs strong historical performance and low expense ratio add to the appeal of the Bitcoin ETF. Key risks include crypto volatility and potential outflows during risk-off periods, but IBIT remains an excellent low-cost choice for bullish Bitcoin investors. BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) is a publicly-traded Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) ETF, the largest in its category, with a strong historical net asset value record and a low expense ratio, allowing investors to participate in Bitcoin's recent bull-run. The ETF is a cost-efficient way for investors to get exposure to the world‚Äôs largest digital currency which continues to dominate the cryptocurrency market. Recently we have seen favorable stablecoin legislation with the GENIUS Act that resulted in new investor optimism with regards to digital assets, specifically Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ). Bitcoin also reached multiple new all-time highs lately which has put the digital currency back on the map for investors. Data by YCharts Previous rating I did not cover the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF in the past, but I have had a very favorable opinion on Bitcoin for a very long period time . In fact, only recently did AI GPU maker Nvidia ( NVDA ) replace my Bitcoin holding as the largest position in my portfolio. I also covered Coinbase Global ( COIN ), a leading U.S.-oriented trading platform for cryptocurrencies, which I continue to rate as a buy, chiefly due to rising institutional adoption. Further, favorable regulation in the form of the GENIUS Act lifted up the price of Bitcoin to new all-time highs lately. Bitcoin continues to dominate the market, GENIUS Act legislation legitimizes the world's #1 cryptocurrency Currently, the Bitcoin price is hovering around $123,000 and has seen a series of consecutive all-time highs in the last month. Bitcoin is the number one global currency by market capitalization as well as market dominance. The outstanding supply of Bitcoins is currently worth $2.4T and Bitcoin represents approximately 60% of the entire cryptocurrency market. Coin Market Cap Recently, U.S. congress made a concerted effort to make America the capital for crypto investors in the world. This drive has led to the passing of the so-called GENIUS Act , a specific piece of legislation that regulates stablecoin issuers and lays out a regulatory framework for companies that issue them. Stablecoins are key to the cryptocurrency market as they provide investors with an opportunity to exit volatile cryptocurrency positions and park money safely on the sidelines. The GENIUS Act has led to renewed interest in cryptocurrencies and with Bitcoin flirting with new all-time highs, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF could be a vehicle for investors to invest in the world's biggest cryptocurrency. A key driver for Bitcoin is growing cryptocurrency adoption in both retail and institutional markets. In my last work on Coinbase -- A Directional Bet On Bitcoin -- I highlighted the importance of Bitcoin for trading platforms as a main driver of revenue and income growth. In the first-quarter, Bitcoin represented 27% of Coinbase's trading volume and 26% of its transaction revenue, highlighting the cryptocurrency's dominating position in the cryptocurrency market. The GENIUS Act could further accelerate especially institutional interest in Bitcoin, as well as other digital assets, which in turn could boost the cryptocurrency's dominance in the market. Companies like Strategy ( MSTR ) are also aggressively raising capital to make more Bitcoin purchases which, given the limited supply of Bitcoin, could be a catalyst for the cryptocurrency's price as well. Coinbase The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF is the largest ETF in the crypto universe with investable assets of ~$86.0B which makes it about 3.6X larger than the second-largest Bitcoin ETF, the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ), and 4.0X larger than the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ). IBIT owns a total of 738,000 Bitcoins and therefore offers investors a direct way to invest in the growth, not only of Bitcoin, but of the entire cryptocurrency universe. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF also has a very competitive expense ratio of 0.25% annually, compared to 0.25% for the FBTC and 1.5% for the GBTC. Data by YCharts So far, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF has done a decent job in growing investors' investment: A $10,000 investment made at the beginning of 2024 would have grown to about $25,000 today, representing a 2.5X factor increase (~150% gain). Further, with the regulatory environment turning profoundly more pro-crypto with the passing of the GENIUS Act, I believe Bitcoin is in a position to achieve new record highs in the second half of 2025. iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF Investment returns: IBIT vs. FBTC vs. GBTC The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF has put up strong performance numbers since inception in 2024, and it has done slightly better than its main ETF rivals. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF has been so far very effective in representing the underlying price development of Bitcoin (see chart below). Since the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF is the largest ETF of its category, it does not only offer investors a competitive expense ratio, but also a very high degree of liquidity. Data by YCharts Risks with IBIT The biggest risk with the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF is that the ETF may lose assets if the cryptocurrency market went into a tailspin or a longer-lasting correction. Capital invested in crypto ETFs may flee quickly in the event of a price draw-down which could further pressure Bitcoin prices. If cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin drop out-of-favor with investors, they may see a serious net asset value drop and suffer a period of significant under-performance compared to other asset classes. Final thoughts The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF is an excellent investment product for investors that look for low-cost exposure to the world's biggest and most dominant cryptocurrency. Currently, the cryptocurrency market also experiences a significant change in investor sentiment following the passing of the GENIUS Act and an improved regulatory landscape that legitimizes stablecoin issuers and the cryptocurrency ecosystem more generally. With Bitcoin reaching a series of new all-time highs in the month of July, I believe this is still a good time to invest in the most-trusted digital currency available, and potentially play a continual upside breakout. In my opinion, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF has done an excellent job of mimicking the performance of the underlying Bitcoin price since its inception and I consider IBIT a great alternative to owning Bitcoin outright.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4805127-ibit-a-simple-way-to-play-bitcoin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|REGULATION","IBIT",cryptocompare
2025-07-28T15:09:13,"PayPay Expands Crypto Payments for U.S. Merchants to Cut Cross-Border Fees","Digital payments giant PayPal (PYPL) said it is rolling out a service that lets U.S. merchants accept over 100 cryptocurrencies in payment for purchases as it aims to cut cross-border fees. The feature, dubbed Pay with Crypto and available in the coming weeks, enables shoppers to use crypto wallets like MetaMask and Coinbase at checkout. Payments can be made with digital assets such as bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), XRP (XRP) and stablecoins like USDC and USDT, covering 90% of the total crypto market cap. The merchants receive U.S. dollars, settling the transaction almost instantaneously, a spokesperson said Monday. The company will charge a 0.99% service fee, some 90% less than international credit card processing, PayPal said. ""Businesses of all sizes face incredible pressure when growing globally, from increased costs for accepting international payments to complex integrations,"" President and CEO Alex Chriss said in a statement. ""Imagine a shopper in Guatemala buying a special gift from a merchant in Oklahoma City,"" he cited as an example. ""Using PayPal's open platform, the business can accept crypto for payments, increase their profit margins, pay lower transaction fees, get near instant access to proceeds, and grow funds stored as PYUSD at 4% when held on PayPal."" The rollout extends PayPal‚Äôs push into digital assets, which includes its U.S. dollar stablecoin (PYUSD) and recent partnerships to expand stablecoin use globally. Merchants can also earn yield on PYUSD balances held within PayPal accounts. Blockchain rails, especially stablecoins, are increasingly viewed as a cheaper and faster alternative for cross-border payments than traditional the banking system.

2025-07-28T15:03:07,"10x Research Founder Markus Thielen Reveals the Optimal Entry Level for Bitcoin Bulls! Here Are the Details","As Bitcoin price continues to hover around $119,000, investors are waiting for the right time to join a new bull rally. However, current levels pose a dilemma for investors: Should they enter now or wait for a better pullback? Is $111,673 the Optimal Entry Level for Bitcoin Bulls? 10x Research founder Markus Thielen offers a clear answer to this question. He argues that Bitcoin's $111,673 level, which acted as resistance in May and has now become support, could be the entry point offering the best risk-reward ratio for investors. ‚ÄúWe would prefer Bitcoin to retest the $111,673 breakout level. This level would offer a better risk/reward ratio,‚Äù Thielen said in a note to clients on Monday. The risk-reward ratio helps investors determine whether to enter a position by comparing the potential loss of an investment to the potential gain. A 1:2 ratio is typically targeted; that is, an investor aims for at least 2 units of return for 1 unit of risk. This makes entries near support levels attractive for bullish trades. But what if the expected pullback doesn't materialize? According to Thielen, a break above $120,000 could signal a market re-entry. Specifically, this level would represent a break of the falling trendline connecting the July 14 and July 23 peaks. ‚ÄúA sustained rally, especially above $120,000, could justify repositioning with the trend. However, stop-losses would need to be kept quite tight in this situation,‚Äù Thielen says. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading sideways around $119,500. The rally, which gained over 1% on Sunday, was fueled by news of the signing of the largest trade agreement in history between the US and the European Union. In light of technical analysis, two levels stand out for investors to watch carefully: $111,673 is the ideal support point for a healthier entry, while $120,000 stands out as a potential breakout level that indicates the trend is gaining strength again. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-28T15:00:16,"Ethereum Quiet Takeover: How Declining BTC Dominance Is Fueling ETH‚Äôs Rise","Ethereum is steadily gaining ground as Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance continues to decline, signaling a quiet shift in market power. As ETH captures a larger share of the crypto landscape, key support and resistance levels are now in focus, pointing to potential for further upside. Ethereum Captures Larger Market Slice as BTC Weakens In a recent update on X, The Boss pointed out that Ethereum‚Äôs dominance in the crypto market is steadily increasing, aligning with previous expectations. As Bitcoin dominance begins to slip, Ethereum is gaining momentum, gradually capturing a larger share of the total market capitalization. This shift highlights the growing confidence in Ethereum‚Äôs relative strength compared to Bitcoin under current market conditions. Related Reading: Billionaire Mike Novogratz Says Ethereum Will Enter Price Discovery If It Takes Out This Level The Boss also emphasized the technical significance of a green line marked on the dominance chart, identifying it as a key support zone. As long as Ethereum dominance remains above this level, the bullish outlook remains intact. This support has previously acted as a reliable floor during past consolidations, and holding above it could provide the foundation for further gains in dominance. Attention is now turning to potential resistance zones, which The Boss illustrated using yellow lines derived from Fibonacci retracement levels. These levels represent likely areas where ETH dominance could face selling pressure or hesitation. However, surpassing them could indicate further strengthening of Ethereum‚Äôs position in the market. Overall, The Boss‚Äôs analysis suggests that the decline in Bitcoin dominance may be fueling Ethereum‚Äôs rise, and the technical setup remains favorable for ETH as long as it stays above the highlighted support. ETH Eyes Key Resistance Zone At $3,900 Within Rising Channel Thomas Anderson recently shared his analysis of the ETHUSD H1 chart, observing that Ethereum was trading at $3,851.25 and approaching a key resistance zone between $3,876 and $3,900. Price action is unfolding within an ascending channel, with the upper yellow line marking a critical resistance area. Related Reading: Ethereum Could Shoot Above $4,000 This Week, Predicts Analyst He further noted that the 200-day moving average, represented by the red line on the chart, is offering dynamic support around the $2,900 level. This moving average has played a crucial role in sustaining the uptrend and remains an important level to monitor in case of a retracement. The analyst highlighted that Ethereum is now testing the upper boundary of a larger ascending channel, with the $3,287.74 level acting as a solid support zone in the 4H context. Anderson emphasized that this level has served as a major floor during recent consolidations, indicating that any near-term pullback may stabilize there. While the trend remains bullish, ETH could face a temporary dip at current levels before a sustained breakout above the $3,900 area.

Most XRP supporters believe Bitcoin maximalists are fuelling FUD against the cryptocurrency. China‚Äôs influence on Bitcoin is a concern for XRP supporters. The Bitcoin-XRP conflict remains one of the longest-running feuds between rival crypto communities, a battle that has continued for several years.
