2025-07-28T08:55:10,"Digital Asset Inflows Surge: Ethereum Leads Remarkable $1.9 Billion Boom on ETF Optimism","BitcoinWorld Digital Asset Inflows Surge: Ethereum Leads Remarkable $1.9 Billion Boom on ETF Optimism The cryptocurrency market is buzzing, and for good reason! We’re witnessing a truly remarkable shift in investor sentiment, as evidenced by a colossal influx of capital into digital asset investment products. Last week alone, a staggering $1.9 billion flowed into these products, marking an impressive 15th consecutive week of positive sentiment. This sustained interest underscores a growing confidence among institutional and retail investors alike, particularly as the spotlight turns towards potential new investment avenues. But what’s truly fascinating is which digital assets are leading this charge, and what it signals for the broader crypto landscape. Understanding the Recent Digital Asset Inflows According to the latest Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report by CoinShares, published in a detailed Medium blog post, the narrative is clear: while overall sentiment is positive, the distribution of these Digital Asset Inflows tells a compelling story of market rotation and anticipation. This report serves as a crucial barometer for institutional interest and investor allocation trends within the digital asset space. Here’s a quick breakdown of where the capital is heading: Ethereum (ETH): Leading the pack with an astonishing $1.59 billion in inflows. This marks its second-largest weekly inflow on record, highlighting an unprecedented surge of interest. Solana (SOL): Not far behind in terms of significant gains, attracting a robust $311 million . XRP: Showing strong resilience and renewed interest with $189 million in inflows. Bitcoin (BTC): In a surprising turn, the king of crypto experienced $175 million in outflows. This dynamic flow of capital suggests a strategic reallocation by investors, moving beyond Bitcoin to explore opportunities in other promising digital assets. But what exactly is fueling this shift, especially Ethereum’s meteoric rise in inflows? Why is Ethereum Leading the Charge in Digital Asset Inflows? The primary catalyst for Ethereum’s exceptional performance in attracting Digital Asset Inflows is the escalating optimism surrounding the potential approval of a spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) in the United States. Following the landmark approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, the market is now eagerly awaiting similar developments for Ethereum. The anticipation is palpable, and for good reason: Legitimacy and Accessibility: An Ethereum ETF would provide a regulated, easily accessible investment vehicle for institutional investors and traditional finance players who might be hesitant to directly hold cryptocurrencies. This opens up a vast new pool of capital. Validation of the Asset Class: ETF approvals signal regulatory acceptance and maturity of the underlying asset, boosting investor confidence in Ethereum’s long-term viability and utility. Comparison to Bitcoin ETF Success: The success of Bitcoin ETFs in attracting billions in inflows has set a precedent, suggesting that an Ethereum ETF could see similar, if not greater, demand given Ethereum’s role in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and smart contracts. CoinShares explicitly attributes this altcoin demand to the anticipation of U.S. spot ETF launches, rather than a broad-based market enthusiasm for all digital assets. This distinction is crucial, as it suggests a targeted, strategic investment approach driven by specific regulatory milestones. The Altcoin Awakening: Solana and XRP Join the Inflow Party While Ethereum’s inflows are undoubtedly the headline, the substantial Digital Asset Inflows into Solana and XRP cannot be overlooked. These figures suggest a broader institutional interest in high-performance altcoins and established projects with strong community backing: Solana’s Appeal: Known for its high transaction speeds and low fees, Solana has emerged as a strong contender in the blockchain space, particularly for decentralized applications (dApps) and NFTs. Its growing ecosystem and developer activity likely contribute to its attractiveness for investors seeking alternatives to Ethereum. XRP’s Resurgence: Despite its past regulatory challenges, XRP continues to command significant attention, particularly for its utility in cross-border payments. Renewed optimism surrounding its legal clarity and potential for wider adoption in financial institutions could be driving these inflows. These inflows indicate a diversification strategy among institutional investors, looking beyond the top two cryptocurrencies to capture growth in other promising blockchain ecosystems. Bitcoin’s Outflow: A Cause for Concern or Strategic Rebalancing? The $175 million in outflows from Bitcoin products might seem concerning at first glance, especially given its status as the market leader. However, CoinShares offers a nuanced perspective, suggesting that this isn’t necessarily a sign of bearish sentiment for Bitcoin itself. Instead, it could be attributed to several factors: Profit-Taking: After a significant price rally earlier in the year, some investors might be taking profits from their Bitcoin positions, especially those who invested through the newly launched spot ETFs. Rotation into Altcoins: As the market anticipates an Ethereum ETF and other altcoins show strong momentum, investors might be reallocating capital from Bitcoin to capture potential gains in these surging assets. This is a common strategy in crypto markets, often referred to as ‘altcoin season’ when capital rotates from Bitcoin into altcoins. Market Rebalancing: Institutional portfolios are constantly being rebalanced. These outflows could simply be part of a broader portfolio adjustment, optimizing for risk and reward across different digital assets. It’s important to view Bitcoin’s outflows in the context of the overall market. While some capital exited BTC products, the total Digital Asset Inflows remained overwhelmingly positive, indicating a healthy appetite for the asset class as a whole. What Do These Digital Asset Inflows Mean for the Future? The sustained positive Digital Asset Inflows , especially the shift towards altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and XRP, carry significant implications for the future of the crypto market: Maturing Market: The increasing institutional participation through investment products signifies a maturing market. This suggests that digital assets are being viewed more as legitimate investment vehicles rather than speculative novelties. Potential for Altcoin Season: The strong performance of altcoins in attracting inflows could foreshadow a broader ‘altcoin season,’ where capital continues to flow into various smaller cap cryptocurrencies, driving their prices higher. Regulatory Progress: The focus on ETF approvals underscores the growing importance of regulatory clarity. Positive regulatory developments will likely continue to attract more institutional capital. Diversification Trends: Investors are increasingly diversifying their crypto portfolios beyond just Bitcoin, recognizing the unique value propositions of different blockchain ecosystems. Actionable Insights for Investors Given the current market dynamics driven by significant Digital Asset Inflows , what should investors consider? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed on ETF Developments: Keep a close eye on news regarding spot Ethereum ETF applications and other similar product filings. These can be major market movers. Understand the ‘Why’: Don’t just follow the inflows. Research the underlying reasons for an asset’s performance. For Ethereum, it’s the ETF; for Solana, it might be ecosystem growth; for XRP, regulatory clarity. Consider Diversification: While Bitcoin remains foundational, the current trend highlights the benefits of a diversified portfolio that includes promising altcoins. Risk Management is Key: Despite positive sentiment, the crypto market remains volatile. Invest only what you can afford to lose and consider dollar-cost averaging to mitigate risk. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Are you looking for short-term gains from ETF hype, or are you investing in the long-term potential of blockchain technology? Your strategy should align with your investment horizon. Conclusion: A New Era for Digital Asset Inflows The recent surge in Digital Asset Inflows , particularly the monumental interest in Ethereum, paints a vivid picture of a cryptocurrency market on the cusp of a new era. Driven by the palpable anticipation of U.S. spot ETF approvals, institutional capital is not just entering the market; it’s strategically reallocating, signaling a growing sophistication in investment approaches. While Bitcoin sees some profit-taking and rotation, the overall narrative is one of robust growth and increasing legitimization for the entire digital asset class. This sustained positive sentiment, coupled with the ongoing evolution of regulatory frameworks, suggests a promising future where digital assets play an increasingly integral role in global finance. As investors continue to seek diversified exposure and traditional finance embraces blockchain technology, the stage is set for continued innovation and potentially unprecedented growth in the digital asset space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are digital asset investment products? A1: Digital asset investment products are financial instruments that allow investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies without directly owning them. These often include exchange-traded funds (ETFs), trusts, and exchange-traded notes (ETNs). Q2: Why are Ethereum (ETH) inflows so high compared to Bitcoin (BTC) outflows? A2: Ethereum’s high inflows are primarily driven by strong market anticipation of a spot Ethereum ETF approval in the U.S., similar to the Bitcoin ETF approvals earlier this year. Bitcoin’s outflows, conversely, are seen as profit-taking or strategic reallocation of funds into promising altcoins like Ethereum, rather than a bearish sentiment towards Bitcoin itself. Q3: What is a spot ETF, and why is it significant for cryptocurrencies? A3: A spot ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) holds the actual underlying asset (e.g., Bitcoin or Ethereum) directly. Its significance lies in providing a regulated, accessible, and often more secure way for institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies through traditional brokerage accounts, thereby increasing liquidity and mainstream adoption. Q4: Are these Digital Asset Inflows indicative of a broader bull run? A4: While sustained inflows are a positive sign of increasing institutional interest and market maturity, they don’t guarantee a continuous bull run. The crypto market remains volatile and is influenced by various factors including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory changes, and technological developments. However, strong inflows typically reflect growing investor confidence. Q5: What other altcoins are seeing significant inflows besides Ethereum? A5: Besides Ethereum, Solana (SOL) and XRP have also attracted substantial inflows. Solana is gaining traction due to its high performance and growing ecosystem, while XRP is seeing renewed interest amidst improving regulatory clarity and its utility in cross-border payments. Q6: How can investors participate in these trends? A6: Investors can participate by researching digital assets that align with their investment goals, considering diversification across different cryptocurrencies, staying informed on market developments (especially regarding ETFs), and utilizing risk management strategies like dollar-cost averaging.

Meme coin SPX6900 (SPX) surged to a new all-time high, breaking above the $2 mark and ranking third by market cap at press time. Ethereum (ETH) led the broader altcoin rally, rising over 3% to cross the $3,900 level. The surge followed news that SharpLink Gaming, backed by Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin, purchased an additional 77,210 ETH—worth approximately $295 million—as part of its ongoing accumulation strategy. The CMC Altcoin Season Index rose to 44, up from 21 last month, signalling increasing investor interest beyond Bitcoin. A new altcoin, Bitcoin Penguins (BPENGU), is set to begin its presale later today, aiming to capitalise on the dual momentum of meme-driven enthusiasm and Bitcoin’s recent breakout to new record highs. Positioned at the intersection of viral meme culture and crypto market strength, BPENGU blends the appeal of penguin-themed tokens with the renewed bullishness surrounding Bitcoin. With BTC’s latest rally fueling risk-on sentiment, the project is hoping to ride that wave into the ranks of the top 50 tokens. Why Bitcoin Pengu can grab eyeballs The project aims to blend meme appeal with integration into Bitcoin infrastructure, positioning itself as a potential beneficiary of Bitcoin’s ongoing rally. Among the standout features is a weekly 1 BTC jackpot distributed to top stakers, with rewards issued transparently on-chain—an incentive that aligns with the coin’s alignment to Bitcoin maximalist values. Backed by Bitcoin’s surge above $120,000 this quarter and continued institutional inflows, the broader market has entered what many view as the early phase of altseason. The altcoin season index, which tracks relative performance between Bitcoin and altcoins, has climbed sharply over the past month, suggesting capital rotation is underway. With Bitcoin’s rally showing signs of plateauing, capital rotation appears to be underway, with funds moving into themed altcoins such as BPENGU. The combination of strong Bitcoin momentum, rising interest in meme assets, and the onset of altseason is creating favourable conditions for projects embedded in the Bitcoin ecosystem. The presale is going to go live soon The presale for Bitcoin Penguins brings structure and urgency to the token’s early-stage offering, with a clear end date and a dynamic pricing model designed to reward early buyers. The presale is split into 15 stages, with the price of BPENGU increasing by 5% at each successive stage. This results in a cumulative price increase of 75% from Stage 1 through Stage 15. Investors who enter during the initial stage stand to see notional gains of over 75% by the time the token launches. This escalating price mechanism is aimed at creating strong early momentum and encouraging timely participation, in contrast to the open-ended presales that have recently faced fatigue among crypto investors. The presale is strictly limited to 30 days, ending on August 27, or earlier if the project hits its $10 million hard cap. The team has also confirmed a claim and public listing date of September 2, giving buyers a definitive schedule from day one. That clarity—rare in current presale cycles—is likely to resonate with investors eager for transparency and timely token delivery. The project is positioning itself to capitalise on both Bitcoin’s recent surge past $120,000 and the growing popularity of meme tokens. The combination of a structured presale, thematic branding, and integration into the Bitcoin ecosystem has helped BPENGU gain early attention as the next possible breakout in the altcoin space.

2025-07-28T08:31:24,"BTC could hit a new ATH if it holds above $120K: check forecast","The cryptocurrency market was bearish last week, with over $200 billion wiped out from the market. However, market conditions improved over the weekend, with Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies currently in the green. BTC is looking to break past the $120k resistance level amid institutional backing and could rally higher if market conditions persist over the coming hours and days. Trump’s EU tariff deal boosts investor confidence, Metaplanet adds 780 Bitcoins to holding The cryptocurrency market turned bullish over the weekend thanks to some macroeconomic news. On Sunday, President Donald Trump confirmed a tariff deal with the European Union, scaling levies down to 15% from the previously threatened 30%. The announcement sent the broader cryptocurrency market rallying, with Bitcoin adding 1% to its value to top the $119k mark. Bitcoin could break above the $120k resistance soon and could rally towards a new all-time high. While speaking with CoinDesk, Nassar Al Achkar, Chief Strategy Officer at CoinW, said, “Bitcoin maintained a resilient range and rebounded to $119k after old wallets with tens of thousands of BTC began transferring funds to exchanges, which led some traders to fear a market correction. Numerous institutions continue to onboard into the crypto industry and utilize reserve strategies, showcasing strong demand against recent surges of stock prices.” In addition to that, Japanese firm Metaplanet has continued its Bitcoin buying spree. The company purchased 780 bitcoins for $92.5 million, with an average price of $118,622 per BTC. Thanks to this latest acquisition, Metaplanet now holds 17,132 BTC, worth about $2 billion at current market prices. According to Metaplanet’s CEO, Simon Gerovich, the firm’s average Bitcoin purchase price is now $101,030. BTC could hit a new ATH if the price breaks above $120k The BTC/USD 4-hour chart is bullish and efficient, with a market structure shift created a few hours ago. This indicates a bullish momentum, with the weekly candle also closing bullish. At press time, Bitcoin is trading at $119,014 and is approaching its upper consolidation boundary at $120,000. If Bitcoin’s daily candle closes above the $120k resistance level, it could extend its recovery towards the all-time high price of $123k. An extended bullish run would allow BTC to set a new all-time high around $125k or higher. The 4-hour Relative Strength Index of 53 shows that buyers are regaining control of the market. The MACD lines also crossed into the positive region a few hours ago, suggesting a switch to the bullish bias. However, if BTC fails to close its daily candle above $120k, it might undergo a correction that would allow it to test last week’s low of $115k. An extended bearish run would see BTC retest the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $112,350.

Some altcoins continue to outperform, including ETH, which surged to $3,900, and BNB, which continues to set new ATHs. BTC Stopped Below $120K After spending about ten days in a tight trading range between $117,000 and $120,000, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap started to lose value rapidly last Thursday and Friday as Galaxy Digital was selling vast quantities of BTC for a third party. Consequently, the asset plummeted and bottomed at $114,500. Once the sell-off of 80,000 bitcoins was completed , though, the cryptocurrency started to regain traction and jumped back within its range by Saturday. It spent the weekend there as well, and even jumped toward the upper boundary on Sunday evening as US President Donald Trump announced a trade deal with the European Union. Bitcoin kept climbing during the early Monday morning hours and rose to almost $120,000. However, it was once again rejected there and pushed south by a grand to roughly $119,000 as of press time. Its market capitalization has remained at around $2.365 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts has taken another hit and is below 59% now. BTCUSD.

Now, the Bitcoin price has sparked a big break on other token charts, including Ethereum’s. Ethereum’s also got news of its own, as the bullish wave continues, but there’s an upcoming crypto project stealing attention in the headlines. Could BTC and ETH whales be moving on to the next 100x crypto? Bitcoin: trailblazer in correction mode? The Bitcoin news for about a month now revolved around the top token’s price, as the BTC price kept setting and resetting its all-time high for almost two weeks. It was interesting to find Bitcoin rising from its $103,000 valuation at the start of July, but its eventual destination at $123,000 was quite unexpected. While hype played its part in driving the BTC price that high, Bitcoin was already set for the top. Market correction has taken over now, as Bitcoin currently trades at about $118,000. Bulls could take it further, up to its ATH, but the bears are still lurking. Ethereum news: BlackRock buy adds to bullish ETH As expected, Ethereum joined the bullish train started by Bitcoin, eventually reaching $3,780 in the past month. The ETH price has gotten a 53.7% boost on the monthly timeframe, but it’s not all down to Bitcoin. BlackRock has recently added to the bullishness on Ethereum, buying up to $440 million worth of ETH tokens in anticipation of spot ETFs on Ethereum. It’s been all bullish for the top altcoin since then, even though some whales might be headed elsewhere. Profit taking has been rife on both Bitcoin and Ethereum and one wonders where the next sensation is at. Remittix is a new DeFi project with potential for 100x–that could be an option.

2025-07-28T08:10:11,"Bitcoin Buy Zone: Unlocking Thielen’s $112K Opportunity","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Buy Zone: Unlocking Thielen’s $112K Opportunity Are you closely watching the cryptocurrency markets, searching for that opportune moment to expand your portfolio? For many investors, identifying the perfect Bitcoin Buy Zone is akin to finding a hidden treasure map in the volatile world of digital assets. Recent insights from a prominent industry expert suggest that such a zone might be closer than you think, potentially offering a strategic entry point for those looking to capitalize on Bitcoin’s next major move. Understanding the Bitcoin Buy Zone: Thielen’s Crucial Insight The cryptocurrency market, known for its rapid price swings, often presents unique opportunities for astute investors. Recently, attention has been drawn to a specific price level that could signal a significant buying opportunity for Bitcoin (BTC). According to CoinDesk, Markus Thielen, the respected head of research at Matrixport, has pinpointed the $111,673 mark as a potential sweet spot for accumulation. Thielen’s analysis is rooted in a fundamental principle of technical analysis: the transformation of resistance into support. What once acted as a ceiling for Bitcoin’s price in May could now serve as a solid floor, preventing further declines and providing a launching pad for a future rally. This shift is critical because it suggests a strengthening of market structure around this particular price point, making it a compelling Bitcoin Buy Zone for strategic investors. Why $111,673 is a Critical Bitcoin Buy Zone The significance of the $111,673 level isn’t arbitrary; it’s backed by historical price action. In May, Bitcoin encountered substantial selling pressure around this figure, preventing it from advancing higher. However, in the ever-evolving dynamics of financial markets, what was once a barrier can become a foundation. Here’s why this level is particularly important: Historical Resistance: The price point of $111,673 previously functioned as a strong resistance level. This means that a significant number of sellers were active at this price, preventing Bitcoin from breaking through. Potential Support Flip: When an asset manages to break above a resistance level and then retests it from above, that former resistance often transforms into new support. This ‘flip’ indicates that buyers who were previously hesitant or sellers who were active at that level have now capitulated or shifted their positions, paving the way for upward momentum. Validation of Strength: A successful retest and bounce off this level would validate Bitcoin’s underlying strength and the conviction of buyers, signaling that the market is ready for a more sustained upward trend. This retest is what defines the crucial Bitcoin Buy Zone . For investors, a slip below $112,000, specifically towards $111,673, isn’t necessarily a cause for alarm but rather a signal to prepare for potential entry. It’s a retest of strength, a chance for the market to confirm its bullish resolve before embarking on a stronger rally. Navigating Market Volatility: Strategies for the Bitcoin Buy Zone While identifying a potential Bitcoin Buy Zone is valuable, it’s equally important to pair this insight with a robust trading strategy. Market volatility is a constant in crypto, and even the most promising setups require careful risk management. Thielen’s analysis extends beyond just identifying the buy zone; it also offers guidance on managing positions as the market evolves. Here’s how investors might approach this: Price Level Thielen’s Analysis Strategic Implication $111,673 Former resistance, now potential support. Key Bitcoin Buy Zone for accumulation, anticipating a retest and bounce. Below $112,000 Favorable buying opportunity as BTC dips. Consider staggered entries or monitoring for a bounce from the $111,673 level. Above $120,000 (Sustained Breakout) Indicates a strong trend reversal. Implement tighter stop-loss strategies to protect gains and manage risk in a confirmed uptrend. A sustained breakout above $120,000 would be a strong indicator of a trend reversal. This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it signals that Bitcoin has firmly established an upward trajectory. At this point, Thielen advises a shift in strategy: employing tighter stop-loss orders. This proactive risk management ensures that profits are locked in and potential losses are minimized, even if the market experiences an unexpected downturn after a significant rally. Is This the Ultimate Bitcoin Buy Zone Opportunity? While Thielen’s analysis provides a compelling argument for a strategic Bitcoin Buy Zone , it’s essential to consider the broader market context and individual investment goals. No single indicator guarantees future price movements, but expert insights, especially from reputable sources like Matrixport, offer valuable perspectives. The idea of a retest acting as a strong support level is a classic technical pattern, often observed across various financial markets. For Bitcoin, which has demonstrated remarkable resilience and growth over its history, such patterns can precede significant upward movements. However, investors should always perform their own due diligence and consider factors like: Overall Market Sentiment: Is the broader crypto market bullish or bearish? Macroeconomic factors and regulatory news can also influence Bitcoin’s price. Trading Volume: A retest with strong buying volume at the support level would further validate the strength of the Bitcoin Buy Zone . Risk Tolerance: Every investment carries risk. Investors should only allocate capital they are comfortable losing and ensure their portfolio is diversified. For those contemplating an entry, the potential retest of $111,673 offers a structured approach rather than speculative guesswork. It provides a data-driven rationale for a strategic entry, aligning with the principles of informed decision-making. Actionable Insights for Your Portfolio So, what does this mean for you, the investor? Here are some actionable insights based on Thielen’s analysis: Monitor Closely: Keep a keen eye on Bitcoin’s price action, particularly around the $111,673 to $112,000 range. Prepare Your Strategy: If you’re looking to buy, consider setting limit orders around the identified support level, or be ready to execute trades if the price dips into this Bitcoin Buy Zone and shows signs of bouncing. Implement Stop-Losses: Regardless of your entry point, always have a clear exit strategy. As Thielen suggests, once Bitcoin breaks above $120,000, tightening your stop-loss orders is a prudent measure to protect your capital. Diversify and Educate: While Bitcoin is a dominant force, a balanced portfolio often includes other assets. Continuously educate yourself on market trends and technical analysis to make informed decisions. Remember, the goal isn’t just to buy low, but to buy strategically, understanding the underlying market dynamics and managing associated risks. Conclusion: Seizing the Strategic Bitcoin Buy Zone Markus Thielen’s analysis from Matrixport provides a compelling framework for understanding Bitcoin’s current market dynamics. By identifying the $111,673 level as a crucial potential support, he offers investors a clear target for a strategic Bitcoin Buy Zone . This insight, combined with the guidance on managing positions post-$120,000 breakout, underscores the importance of data-driven decision-making in the fast-paced crypto market. While no investment is without risk, leveraging expert analysis can significantly enhance your ability to navigate volatility and position yourself for future growth. As Bitcoin continues its journey, being prepared for these pivotal moments can make all the difference in your investment success.

The Donald Trump administration has pushed for bipartisan efforts to create clear crypto regulatory frameworks. Bitcoin price will experience parabolic growth once the U.S. SEC approves in-kind creation and redemptions. The United States spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen record growth, reaching over $150 billion in net assets . However, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has still not approved “in-kind” creation and redemption for these funds, a key feature that would allow for a more seamless flow of liquidity. Nearly two years after the inception of the spot BTC ETFs, the only mode of redemption remains in cash form. According to Nate Geraci, founder of The ETF Institute and the President of NovaDius Wealth Management, spot BTC ETF issuers were ready to handle in-kind creation and redemption from the beginning. “The fact that in-kind creations and redemptions on spot BTC ETFs are still not approved 19 months after launch is absolutely ridiculous.

2025-07-28T08:05:52,"Bitcoin Surges Past $119,000 Amid Rebound Momentum","Bitcoin briefly surged past $119,000 on Sunday, continuing a strong rebound after touching two-week lows near $114,500. The price action marked a notable shift in momentum, with bulls reclaiming key levels despite recent heavy selling pressure. Volatility Returns Near Weekly Close Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView revealed BTC/USD regaining strength as it attempted a daily close above the 10-day simple moving average. This movement came as investors digested easing tensions between the U.S. and China, following an agreement to delay the implementation of reciprocal tariffs. The renewed optimism supported a push above $118,000, prompting traders to focus on critical resistance levels heading into the new week. Crypto investor Ted Pillows emphasized the significance of the $119,500 threshold. “$BTC needs to break above $119.5K for a big move. If that doesn’t happen, this consolidation will continue,” he posted on X. “I think BTC could break above this level next month which will start the next leg up.” Reclaiming Lost Ground Analyst Rekt Capital pointed to Bitcoin’s recovery into its former trading range. “Bitcoin has Daily Closed above the blue Range Low, kickstarting a break back into the very briefly lost Range,” he shared alongside a chart analysis. “Any dips into the Range Low (confluent with the new Higher Low) would be a retest attempt to confirm the reclaim.” Despite the upward move, caution still lingered in the market. Trader CrypNuevo highlighted the potential for a further drop to fill the wick left on the daily chart. “If we zoom out, we can see that the main liquidation level is at $113.8k,” he explained. “Consequently, I consider the downside liquidation cluster to be the natural target in the mid-term ($114.5k–$113.6k).” Short Squeeze Risk Increases According to CoinGlass, short sellers may face increased liquidation risk if BTC climbs higher. The current “max pain” level for shorts is around $119,650. Should Bitcoin retest its all-time high near $123,000, total short liquidations could exceed $1.1 billion.
