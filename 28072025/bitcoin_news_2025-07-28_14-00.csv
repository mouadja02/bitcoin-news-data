2025-07-28T11:45:19,"$3,430,000,000 in Ethereum (ETH) ‚ÄòLost Forever‚Äô Due to This Reason, According to Coinbase Director","Billions of dollars worth of Ethereum ( ETH ) have been lost forever due to one simple reason, according to Coinbase director Conor Grogan. In a post on the social media platform X, Grogan says that based on his research, a ‚Äúminimum‚Äù of 913,111 ETH, worth about $3.43 billion, has been lost forever due to user error. The lost coins represent about 0.76% of the supply of ETH, according to Grogan. Among the biggest losses was when the Web3 Foundation ‚Äì a major crypto-supporting nonprofit ‚Äì lost access to 306,276 ETH due to a bug in the Parity multisig wallet software. Grogan also notes that when accounting for Ethereum‚Äôs EIP-1559 burn mechanism, about $23.42 billion or around 5% of all ETH ever made has been permanently destroyed. And the number gets even bigger when considering the amount of ETH that aren‚Äôt necessarily gone forever, but likely inaccessible due to lost private keys. ‚ÄúTo be clear, this $3.4 billion+ number significantly undershoots the actual lost/inaccessible ETH amount. It just covers instances where Ethereum is locked forever. For example, it doesn‚Äôt cover all lost private keys or things like Genesis wallets that have been forgotten.‚Äù At time of writing, ETH is trading at $3,869, up nearly 60% in the last month.

To qualify, applicants must have lived in Alaska for the entire year of 2023, not claimed residency elsewhere, avoided felony convictions, and remained in the state for at least 185 days. For residents looking to invest their checks, Finbold consulted OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT to build a custom cryptocurrency portfolio using the $1,702 amount. Notably, the AI model excluded Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ), instead focusing on promising altcoins. Solana (SOL) Solana ( SOL ) received the largest allocation at 40%, or approximately $681. As of press time, Solana was trading at $192.06, having emerged as one of the standout performers of the ongoing market rally. SOL price chart. Source: Finbold ChatGPT chose Solana due to its reputation as one of the fastest and most scalable layer-1 blockchains, with growing adoption in the payments and decentralized applications sectors. Its low transaction fees, robust developer ecosystem, and increasing institutional interest, including speculation around a potential Solana ETF, further solidify its long-term appeal. Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink ( LINK ) took the second spot with a 35% allocation, translating to about $596. According to ChatGPT, Chainlink plays a vital role in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem as the leading oracle network, bridging smart contracts with real-world data such as asset prices and weather. With the rise of tokenized real-world assets and DeFi protocols, the AI sees Chainlink as foundational infrastructure. Its expanding use cases and strategic partnerships make it a dependable mid-cap option. As of press time, LINK was trading at $19.13, up 1.1% in the last 24 hours. LINK price chart.

With demand for AI infrastructure rising rapidly, ChatGPT sees Render as a high-upside opportunity.

2025-07-28T11:25:52,"Strategy STRC Stock Offering Legitimizes Bitcoin & Boosts Bitcoin Hyper","Strategy (previously MicroStrategy) has launched a $2.521B Bitcoin-backed investment product so that investors can earn up to 9% annual returns. Named the ‚ÄòStretch Preferred Stock‚Äô (STRC), it doesn‚Äôt give investors direct exposure to $BTC. Instead, it uses the crypto‚Äôs strong historical performance to support steady, high-yield payouts. But as Bitcoin dives deeper into TradFi, the network is bound to face growing pressure to evolve. Even before this heightened demand, it struggles with limitations, like slow transactions and limited programmability. Thankfully, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) will fix such woes. Once deployed in Q3 2025, the Layer 2 network promises to unlock critical utility for Bitcoin as the network continues to attract both DeFi and TradFi attention. STRC Tops Venture Capital as Largest US IPO Strategy is using its hefty $BTC treasury as a financial backbone to create a stable, income-generating product. And its attention is already unmatched. Given that the STRC has already raised $2.521B , it has quickly become the most extensive US initial public offering (IPO) of 2025 so far. It even outpaces prominent names like Venture Global and CoreWeave. All the proceeds made from the stock offering will go toward corporate needs, which involve snagging more $BTC. And it won‚Äôt be small amounts. Just days before the STRC‚Äôs launch, Strategy scooped up an additional 6,220 $BTC for $739.8M , pushing its total holdings to 607,770 $BTC (at the time of writing, it‚Äôs worth a whopping $72.27B) . The hype surrounding STRC not only shows growing interest in $BTC-backed investment products but signals Wall Street‚Äôs increasing interest in crypto-powered income strategies. STRC Stands Out With 9% Yield & SOFR Volatility Guardrails What boosts the stock‚Äôs appeal is that it‚Äôs designed to trade at $100 per share based on Bitcoin‚Äôs tendency to average out a 3-4% annual return. Plus, the fact that it offers monthly dividend payments starting at a 9% annualized rate. The payout isn‚Äôt fixed; it may fluctuate based on market conditions. However, Strategy is aware of such challenges, so has guardrails in place to protect investors from sudden or arbitrary drops. Any changes to the payout must follow a well-established interest rate called the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) . As such, the company cannot simply lower it without justification. Suppose Strategy misses a payment, interest will accrue and be paid later. This ensures that investors still get paid what they‚Äôre owed ‚Äì even if Strategy temporarily pauses monthly payouts. Moreover, once the shares are listed on the Nasdaq or NYSE, Strategy has the right to redeem them at $101 per share, including any unpaid dividends. Additionally, if the company undergoes any major changes, investors can request that Strategy buy back their shares at full value. Each of these features helps keep the stock price steady (at roughly $100), while offering higher returns than most short-term investments that you‚Äôd find in traditional finance. It also shifts the narrative around $BTC being a volatile asset to a productive store of value. Consequently, it‚Äôs a major win for #1 crypto (currently valued at a hefty $119K , up by over 10% compared to last month), as well as the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. But as Bitcoin moves deeper into TradFi, the network is bound to face growing pressure in order to evolve. But fear not: Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is set to launch to extend the network‚Äôs capabilities. Bitcoin Hyper to Redefine Bitcoin‚Äôs Capabilities Bitcoin Hyper goes beyond being yet another Layer 2 network; it‚Äôs the infrastructure that‚Äôs highly necessary to update Bitcoin as it continues attracting unprecedented attention. Once launched in the coming months, it promises to solve the blockchain network‚Äôs most pressing challenges: slow transaction speeds, high fees, and the lack of native smart contracts. It‚Äôll integrate the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to make the network fast and inexpensive, similar to Solana. This upgrade will also unlock key features, including high-performance dApps, DeFi protocols, the launch of the best meme coins , and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Considering that experts predict that 30% of the world‚Äôs financial assets could be tokenized by 2030 , Bitcoin Hyper is well-positioned to make Bitcoin a powerhouse in this rapidly evolving market alone. Notably, a Canonical Bridge is the foundation of the entire Layer 2 network. It‚Äôll allow $BTC to flow seamlessly between the Layer 1 and Layer 2. This way, you‚Äôll be able to tap into Bitcoin‚Äôs original security while relishing the speed and flexibility of a modern smart contract platform. The platform‚Äôs native token, $HYPER, powers the network through governance, cost-friendly gas fees, and staking rewards (of which are currently valued at a commendable 189% APY). Since its May 2025 presale debut, $HYPER has already raised over $5.4M. Its success is fueled by whales, three of whom injected $74.9K , $54.1K , $53.9K , which highlights long-term confidence in the Layer 2‚Äôs capabilities from the get-go. Join the Bitcoin Hyper Presale for Possible 185% Returns Strategy‚Äôs Stretch Preferred Stock is a significant step forward for Bitcoin‚Äôs role in TradFi. The main reason is that it gives income-focused investors a way to benefit from $BTC‚Äôs long-term performance without dealing with rapid price swings often seen in crypto. STRC‚Äôs size and demand show that investors are warming up to $BTC-backed financial products at a quick pace. But does Bitcoin alone have the infrastructure to support this level of adoption? The answer is no. Thankfully, Bitcoin Hyper is poised to address the network‚Äôs pain points. It‚Äôll unlock the performance needed to take Bitcoin to the next level. To help elevate the Bitcoin network at a pivotal moment, you can buy $HYPER on presale for just $0.012425. Once the Layer 2 goes live, its price is anticipated to reach $0.32 ‚Äì there‚Äôs no better time to join for possible gains exceeding 185%. We‚Äôre not financial advisors.

Long-term projections show XRP could hit $26.50 by 2030 and $526 by 2050. XRP, one of the top five crypto assets, is gaining renewed traction as institutional adoption expands and its prolonged legal standoff nears resolution. Since President Trump returned to office, XRP has seen a surge in on-chain activity, bullish investor sentiment, and increasing chatter around a possible XRP ETF approval. In July 2025, XRP marked a new all-time high of $3.66 , coinciding with the launch of the ProShares Ultra XRP ETF , which is a milestone that further fueled optimism. With more asset managers eyeing approval and institutional capital flowing in, investors are now closely watching where XRP could head next in this evolving market landscape. With these developments in play, XRP price prediction is becoming a major focus for investors. Can XRP reach $100? Is a $500 target realistic in the long term? This article dives deep into XRP price prediction for 2025 and beyond through 2030.

We expect the XRP coin price to reach $5.81 in 2025. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.3 $4.89 $5.81 XRP Price Today Cryptocurrency XRP Token XRP Price $¬†3.24633538 2.06% Market cap $¬†192,311,760,798.46 Circulating Supply 59,239,646,627.00 Trading Volume $¬†6,830,322,495.8371 All-time high $3.84 Jan 04, 2018 All-time low $0.002802 Jul 07, 2014 XRP Price Analysis 2025 (H1 2025) In the first half of 2025, the XRP price movement transitioned from a period of decline into a phase of consolidation. In Q2, XRP tested the upper boundary of a multi-month descending wedge at $2.65 around mid-May. However, it failed to hold above a crucial swing low support near $2.10, showing signs of limited upside momentum due to ongoing global tensions at that time. Investors were optimistic in Q2 about a positive legal catalyst around June 16, expecting a favorable update in the SEC lawsuit. Instead, the court issued a 60-day pause in appeals, leaving market sentiment hanging, which proves less momentum in price action. Even matters worsened when, in the first half‚Äôs last month, precisely on June 17, the SEC postponed the approval of Franklin Templeton‚Äôs XRP spot ETF, due to market instability amid geopolitical concerns. During the third weekend of June, the U.S. even fired airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, shaking the global markets. Even top assets like BTC, ETH, dropped, and XRP was no exception either, as it also dipped sharply to $1.94, as sentiment deteriorated. However, the announcement of a ceasefire in the fourth week of June helped the market bounce back, including XRP, and moving to July, bullish sentiment is evident in its price action. XRP Crypto Price Prediction July 2025 Starting June 23rd, the XRP price showed a sharp rebound from its low of $1.94 triggered by a ceasefire news between the US, Israel, and Iran. The bullish sentiment accelerated more on June 28, when Ripple‚Äôs CEO announced they were dropping the cross-appeal in the SEC case . Later, in early July, CLO Stuart Alderoty mentioned that the SEC has also officially ended a four-year legal battle by dropping its appeal against Ripple, too, providing major relief to XRP holders. Nate Geraci , president of The ETF Store, called Ripple‚Äôs move a pivotal moment. He even remarked that the odds of BlackRock jumping into XRP also increased. The ongoing July is filled with positive sentiment that continues to strengthen the XRP price. The investors have been engaged in a ‚Äúbuy-the-dip‚Äù mindset, and investor panic appeared to subside. In July, several more factors joined, like Grayscale added XRP to its Digital Large Cap Fund , and Ripple‚Äôs application for a U.S. banking license further boosted confidence and institutional trust in XRP. More developments that are supporting the ongoing bullish sentiment are due to the third week of July‚Äôs events, for instance, Ripple partners with Ctrl Alt and Dubai Land Department for tokenized real estate on XRP Ledger, which has boosted its utility. The top two major highlights of July is that ProShares launched the first XRP futures ETF on July 18; as a result, the XRP price spiked massively, and other one is that the key crypto bills are passed in the US House of Representatives, including the long-awaited GENIUS Act and CLARITY Act. The recent developments surrounding XRP have sparked optimism, particularly with the potential for increased legal clarity for digital assets. The debut of a spot ETF has raised hopes that other asset managers‚Äô applications for spot XRP ETFs could be approved by the end of the year. On the charts, XRP‚Äôs rally resembles a breakout from the upper resistance of a falling wedge pattern. Since the third week of June, XRP has gained nearly 85%, and from the second week of July, it surged over 60%. However, the momentum faced a setback when a wallet linked to Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen dumped $200 million worth of XRP in the past ten days, coinciding with XRP nearing local highs. This move led to accusations that Larsen was cashing out at the expense of retail investors, with some claiming that those buying the dip were merely providing exit liquidity. This turmoil triggered a significant profit-taking wave, causing XRP‚Äôs price to plummet 19% from its all-time high to $2.95 in just a few days during the fourth week of July. Yet, the price quickly rebounded from $2.95 to $3.08, with many on social media suggesting this was a strategic dip to attract larger investors. Experts are now encouraging buyers to seize this opportunity, believing a more substantial rise is on the horizon. The community sentiment is clear: ‚ÄúThe strong will remain, while the weak will fall.‚Äù From a technical standpoint, the golden cross between XRP‚Äôs 20-day and 50-day EMAs has expanded, indicating bullish potential. If XRP continues to rise, it could soon retest the $3.40 and $3.66 levels by the end of July or into August. Conversely, if the price fails to hold the $3.00 support, a retest of the $2.60 and $2.40 levels may be on the table. Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High July 2025 $1.95 $3.00 $4.00 XRP AI Price Prediction For August 2025 Platform Low Price Average Price High Price Claude $3.00 ‚Äì $3.15 $3.50 ‚Äì $4.00 $7.50 ‚Äì $8.20 Blackbox $2.50 $3.50 $5.00 Gemini $3.00 ‚Äì $4.00 $4.50 ‚Äì $6.00 $6.50 ‚Äì $8.00+ XRP Price Prediction 2025 Moreover, XRP has partnered with Wormhole to utilize its phenomenal cross-chain interoperability. Through this road in development, they seek a real-world adoption to boost. Therefore, consistent developments and crucial partnerships, If XRP manages to break above its all-time high of $3.40 in July 2025, after clearing the high-volume resistance zone at $2.40. Then odds are high that it could realistically target $5 by year-end. This potential rally would likely be fueled by growing optimism from banks, institutional investors, and the possibility of ETF approval which has highest odds in H2 of 2025. Source: TokenTerminal Adding to the bullish case, Ripple‚Äôs stablecoin, RLUSD, is now integrated into its Ripple Payments system, and it is performing well per data from the token terminal. The transfer count has surged from 242 transfer counts to 3.1K transfer counts, holders count surged from 818 to 3.3K, and transfer volume grew from $88 million to $694 million, further solidifying its role in global finance. Notably, institutional dominance is strong as per coincarp , with the top 100 addresses holding 70% of XRP‚Äôs circulating supply, which is positioning XRP as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.

There is a possibility that XRP can break through the $8.50 level and hold the price by the end of 2026. The minimum price of XRP will be around $5.50, with an average trading price of $6.25. Ripple Price Prediction 2027 By 2027, market analysts and experts predict that XRP coin price will range between $7.00 to $13.25. XRP price might record an average level of $9.00. XRP Price Prediction 2028 As per our XRP price prediction 2028, Ripple could increase its use cases. We expect the XRP future price to range between $11.25 to $16.00. The average trading price of Ripple could be around $13.75. XRP Price Prediction 2029 Partnerships with multiple governments and wider adoption might strengthen XRP‚Äôs price in 2029. The price of XRP might record a trading range between $14.25 to $21.50, with an average price of $16.50. XRP Price Prediction 2030 The XRP prediction 2030 depends on Ripple‚Äôs ability to expand its offerings across the crypto market. If everything remains positive, the Ripple coin price could scale between $17.00 to $26.50. With that price range, the average tag could be $19.75.

Yes, XRP is still a good investment for those with a long-term view. With the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit nearing settlement, increasing institutional interest, and rising on-chain activity, XRP‚Äôs fundamentals remain strong. The integration of RLUSD and potential ETF listings further boosts its utility and market potential. While short-term volatility may persist, XRP price prediction models point to significant upside. If regulatory clarity continues, XRP could be well-positioned to reach ambitious targets like $100‚Äîor even higher‚Äîin the coming years. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Meanwhile, BNB Chain‚Äôs decentralized exchange volume reached $190 billion this month, with on-chain transactions rising threefold since April. Risk Metrics Show No Overheating Joao Wedson, CEO of Alphractal, said BNB‚Äôs current Sharpe Ratio remains under 1.0.

Hence, we expect the BTC price to create a 2025 high of ~$168,000. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $71,827.81 $119,713.02 $167,598.22 Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 (H1 2025) Bitcoin‚Äôs performance during the first half of 2025 was mixed, reflecting a combination of macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility. In Q1, the price action remained subdued, primarily due to lingering concerns around U.S. tariff implementations and heightened tensions between Russia and Ukraine. These global issues weighed heavily on market sentiment, keeping BTC in a consolidation phase. However, Q2 brought a notable turnaround. By April and May, easing geopolitical tensions and improved macro signals helped Bitcoin stage a strong rally. By the third week of May, BTC surged to $112,000, marking a significant recovery from earlier lows. Then the price retraced from its May peak, even positive factors like a positive U.S. jobs report on June 6 and resumed U.S.-China trade talks back in June were overshadowed when rising geopolitical concerns between Israel and Iran tensions worsened, triggering renewed selling pressure. On June 17, the situation escalated even sharply when U.S. President Donald Trump issued a warning to Iran‚Äôs Supreme Leader. Iran‚Äôs defiant response and subsequent U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear sites over the third weekend of June sent BTC sliding to $98,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction July 2025 Bitcoin‚Äôs price performance in July 2025 has been nothing short of extraordinary. Since breaking out of its consolidation phase in the last week of June, Bitcoin price has been propelled by whale accumulation, a surge in spot trading volume, and a confirmed technical breakout from a bullish flag pattern. On July 14th, this momentum led Bitcoin to reach a new all-time high of $123,231. However, the excitement was tempered as traders began to take profits, causing the market to pause and recover from its exhaustion. This led to a sideways momentum in price action. Currently, the RSI has dropped from 75 to 61. If BTC breaks the current box range, then RSI might cool off below the neutral line, which suggests that under that condition, it may retest the 50-day EMA band, where renewed buying pressure could spark another rally. However, the recent attempt of bears failed as BTC jumped back from the 20-day EMA band and approached the upper border of the box. If the Bitcoin flips the upper border, then it could eye the psychological milestone of $125,000 in July‚Äôs final days by crossing the current ATH. If the upward momentum persists, this level could be tested before the month concludes. In the short term, Bitcoin has flipped the $116 level and is now retesting the 20-day EMA band at around $115,000. On the flip side, if it dips, then it could retrace to the $110,000 swing low support zone, with the final line of defense resting at approximately $101,000.

Initially, crypto prices dropped, but the market rebounded, leaving panic sellers behind. A similar trend occurred in Q2 2025 when rising Ukraine-Russia tensions led to increased social activity. After a price dip, Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high of $112,000. Now, the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict has prompted U.S. intervention, resulting in another surge in social volume. Bitcoin‚Äôs price dipped to $98,000, but analysts expect a strong rally in H2 2025. Despite geopolitical challenges in Q1 and Q2, the overall outlook for Bitcoin remains bullish. Source: santiment Looking ahead, advancements in financial products, especially ETF flows, could sustain Bitcoin‚Äôs bullish momentum. Market sentiment is optimistic, suggesting Bitcoin may reach new highs. Moreover, the speculation is growing that the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates in the U.S., further supporting Bitcoin‚Äôs upward movement. Also, pata data is evident of its relationship with global liquidity, as global M2 increases, Bitcoin often experiences price surges. Similarly, the CryptoQuant data also indicates rising accumulation, with exchange reserves declining to 2.4 million BTC, down from 3.1 million BTC a year ago. Ultimately, Bitcoin‚Äôs future market potential will depend on buying demand, geopolitical developments, regulatory changes, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Talking about Bitcoin Price Prediction, if things turn bullish, BTC is expected to create a high of $175K. If things go south, we can expect a low of $70K.

2025-07-28T11:16:10,"Bitcoin Over 401(k)? Kiyosaki Warns of Market Crash Worse Than 1929","The post Bitcoin Over 401(k)? Kiyosaki Warns of Market Crash Worse Than 1929 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Robert Kiyosaki , the best-selling author of Rich Dad Poor Dad , has warned that a massive financial crash may be just around the corner and says Bitcoin, along with gold and silver, could be the best protection. In a new tweet, Kiyosaki compared the current state of the U.S. economy to the period leading up to the 1929 Great Depression. He believes another crash, possibly worse than that historic collapse, is now possible. ‚ÄúWe may be on the brink of another 1929 crash and another Great Depression,‚Äù he said. Debt, Money Printing, and a Failing System Kiyosaki blames the rising risk on two key problems: the U.S. government‚Äôs aggressive money printing and its fast-growing debt. ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs debt is out of control. America is the world‚Äôs biggest debtor nation in history. You can only print money to pay your bills‚Ä¶ for so long,‚Äù he wrote. He warned that most people are unaware of how serious the situation is, especially those relying on traditional retirement plans like 401(k)s or IRAs, which are often heavily invested in stocks. Why the Smart Money Is Moving Out of Stocks To back his point, Kiyosaki pointed out that well-known investors Warren Buffett and Jim Rogers have already sold most of their stocks and bonds. ‚ÄúThey are both in cash or silver,‚Äù he noted. It‚Äôs a signal, Kiyosaki says, that the traditional stock market may no longer be the safest place to park wealth. Instead, he says he‚Äôs staying focused on three assets: gold, silver, and Bitcoin. However, Kiyosaki garners a lot of criticism from other analysts or market watchers who feel he might be a tad too ‚Äúdramatic‚Äù. 1. No they didn't 2. pic.twitter.com/gbUtNALQ5c ‚Äî Mark McGrath (@MarkMcGrathCFP) July 28, 2025 A Word of Caution on ETFs In another tweet, Kiyosaki also commented on the growing popularity of ETFs, including Bitcoin ETFs. While he acknowledges they make investing easier, he warned they‚Äôre not the same as owning the real thing. ‚ÄúAn ETF is like having a picture of a gun for personal defense,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSometimes it‚Äôs best to have real gold, silver, Bitcoin, and a gun.‚Äù In short, he believes owning physical or direct assets offers far more protection than holding paper exposure, especially if the financial system takes a hit. While Wall Street is focused on short-term gains, Kiyosaki is urging people to think long-term and consider what might actually hold value if the system breaks. For him, that list includes gold, silver, and Bitcoin ‚Äì not stocks.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-over-401k-kiyosaki-warns-of-market-crash-worse-than-1929/,"BTC|MARKET|FIAT|BUSINESS","News",cryptocompare
2025-07-28T11:11:51,"Why Is Crypto Up Today? ‚Äì July 28, 2025","The crypto market is up today, with most of the top 100 coins per market turning green. The cryptocurrency market capitalization has dropped by 2.7% over the past 24 hours, but it still holds above $4 trillion, now standing at $4.03 trillion. At the same time, the total crypto trading volume is at $148 billion, lower than the ~$220 billion level we‚Äôve been seeing lately. TLDR: Crypto market cap holds above $4 trillion; The majority of the top 100 coins and all top 10 coins are green today; BTC trades at $118,976 and ETH at $3,886; BNB hits new ATH of $852; BTC could hit $132,000 soon and $150,000 by year-end; The probability of ETH hitting $6,000 by 25 December has more than quadrupled. US ETH spot ETFs hit the 16th inflow day in a row; US BTC spot ETFs record positive flows of $130.69 million; ‚ÄôExpect a smoother climb for BTC, and a wilder ride for ETH‚Äô; Market sentiment is set firmly on the lower edge of the greed zone. Crypto Winners & Losers By the time of writing, all top 10 coins per market capitalization have appreciated over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC) increased by 0.6% in a day, now trading at $118,976. This is the second smallest increase today. At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) is up by 2.8% and is now trading at $3,886. Tron (TRX) increased the least: 0.2% to the price of $0.3224. On the other hand, Binance Coin (BNB) appreciated the most in this category. It‚Äôs up 6.6%, currently changing hands at $848. The coin surged to its new all-time high of $852 today. In the top 100 coins category, three coins recorded double-digit increases. SPX6900 (SPX) is the highest among these: it‚Äôs up 12.1% to $2.22. It‚Äôs followed by Optimism (OP) and Ethena (ENA) with 11.2% and 10.7% to $0.8133 and $0.6811, respectively. Fewer than 10 coins in this category are down. The highest drop among these is 5.9% by Curve DAO (CRV) , now trading at $1.02. Others are down 2.3% and less per coin. Overall, the market keeps reacting to positive signals, including higher adoption, while defying negative factors, including macroeconomic pressures. Though not everyone agrees, Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan argues that Bitcoin could break from its historical four-year cycle and post significant gains in 2026. ‚ÄúI broadly think we‚Äôre in for a good few years,‚Äù he said . DID I HEAR SUPER CYCLE??? The four-year cycle is dead and adoption killed it. @Matt_Hougan says we're going higher in 2026. Early profit takers will be left behind!!! Full break down with @JSeyff and @Matt_Hougan in comments pic.twitter.com/Ffn9penapN ‚Äî Kyle Chass√© / DD (@kyle_chasse) July 25, 2025 ‚Äò52% Chance of BTC Hitting $150,000 by Year-End‚Äô John Glover, Chief Investment Officer of Ledn , commented on BTC‚Äôs recent performance, looking at the short-term wave count. ‚ÄúAs all waves in the direction of the trend can be broken down into wave sub-waves, we look at the blue line in the chart below and can clearly see that we are in the process of completing wave 4 of wave iii,‚Äù he says, adding that, once completed, wave iii could complete by rallying to some $132,000. Source: Ledn He continues: ‚ÄúA corrective wave iv will likely follow as we see early profit takers come into play, and we will sell off to somewhere in the region of $120,000 before the rally into year-end to $136,000 to $142,000 to complete Wave 5.‚Äù Meanwhile, Nick Forster, Founder at onchain options platform Derive.xyz , argued that ‚ÄúMike Novogratz‚Äôs $150,000 prediction isn‚Äôt some moonshot anymore. Options markets now imply a 52% chance of BTC hitting $150,000 by year-end.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs even more interesting is the volatility differential: BTC‚Äôs implied December volatility is just 30%, while ETH‚Äôs is 60%. So expect a smoother climb for BTC, and a wilder ride for ETH.‚Äù Source: Derive.xyz, Amberdata Furthermore, ETH‚Äôs upside bets are exploding, Forster says. The probability of ETH hitting $6,000 by 25 December has more than quadrupled, from just under 7% at the start of July to over 30%. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a massive re-pricing of tail risk,‚Äù he concluded. Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, BTC trades at $118,976. Its lowest point today was $117,914, hitting a daily high of $119,754 soon after. It has pulled back somewhat since. Overall, it‚Äôs unchanged in a week and is up 10.7% in a month. As July nears its end, the coin shows strength and resilience. Investors are waiting to see if BTC will retake its ATH level, which would indicate another move higher. Also, Bitcoin may see some increased volatility in the short term, following a $9.7 billion exit by a Satoshi-era whale. Moreover, Ethereum is currently trading at $3,886, rising significantly over the weekend, from $3,621 seen on Friday. It started the day at $3,762, surging over the 24 hours to the current level. Its highest point today is $3,936. There is little doubt in many analysts‚Äô minds that ETH will reach the much-anticipated $4,000 very soon. As seen in the chart below, it‚Äôs been working towards it for the entire July. It‚Äôs up 2.7% in a week and 60.3% in a month, outperforming BTC. That said, per historical data, an August rally could potentially push the price of ETH as high as $6,000 , per certain analyses. Furthermore, the crypto market sentiment has stayed mostly unchanged over the past few days. The crypto fear and greed index has remained in the greed territory for nearly three weeks now. Currently, it stands at 67 today , compared to 64 yesterday, signaling ongoing positivity among investors, with a healthy dose of caution. Meanwhile, the US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw inflows on the previous day of trading. They recorded $130.69 million on 25 July. The cumulative net inflow now stands at $54.82 billion. On Friday, six funds saw positive flows, and one saw outflows. BlackRock is back on top, taking in $92.83 million, followed by Ark&21 Shares ‚Äô $30.27 million. At the same time, Grayscale lost $50.5 million. At the same time, with Friday‚Äôs inflow of $452.72 million , the US ETH ETFs recorded 16 consecutive days of positive flows, still moving towards hitting a new record. The surge in price is fueling institutional interest. The cumulative net inflow is now $9.33 billion. Four funds recorded positive flows, with BlackRock leading the list with $440.1 million. On the other hand, $23.49 million flowed out of Grayscale . Additionally, Bitwise‚Äôs Hougan argues that ETH ETF demand could reach $20 billion within the next year. This would be equivalent to 5.33 million ETH at current prices.

Quick FAQ Why did crypto move against stocks today? The crypto market increased over the last 24 hours, and the stock market closed higher on Friday. The S&P 500 is up by 0.4%, the Nasdaq-100 increased by 0.23%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 0.47%. The stock market reacted positively to quarterly results published by major tech companies. Is this rally sustainable? For now, the rally is still sustainable.

ADA Price prediction suggests potential to reach $2.05 by year-end 2025. Long-term forecasts indicate ADA could hit $10.25 by 2030. The Cardano price prediction for 2025 is generating significant buzz in the crypto market, particularly as we have entered Q3 2025 with July. The transformative Plomin Hard Fork, implemented in Q1, has played a crucial role in this momentum, especially with the announcement of full decentralized governance. This landmark upgrade has reinforced Cardano‚Äôs commitment to community-driven innovation, leading to a strengthening of its internal ecosystem. Even bigger institutions like Grayscale have been applauding the project‚Äôs vision and gave 1/5th allocation in its fund. Industry leaders like IOHK and EMURGO are also actively advancing the Cardano ecosystem. EMURGO‚Äôs partnership with Ctrl Wallet on July 2, 2025, has enhanced Cardano‚Äôs interoperability, enabling connections to over 2,300 blockchains. Moreover, community-driven initiatives focusing on scalability, privacy through the Midnight chain, and integration with Bitcoin DeFi are paving the way for substantial growth. Additionally, Bloomberg analysts have raised odds of potential spot ADA ETF approvals , and strong technical indicators signaling positive trends, investor enthusiasm is at an all-time high. Questions abound: ‚ÄúWill Cardano spearhead the altcoin movement?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat heights can ADA reach by 2050?‚Äù Explore this Cardano price prediction for 2025 and beyond, filled with expert insights and ambitious forecasts. Coinpedia‚Äôs Cardano Price Prediction 2025 Cardano (ADA) is predicted to reach a potential high of $2.05 in 2025 , driven by hopes of ETF approval, full decentralization after the Plomin Hard Fork, and increasing institutional interest. However, if ADA fails to hold above key support, it may range between $0.85 and $1.25 . Table of Contents Coinpedia‚Äôs Cardano Price Prediction 2025 Cardano Price Today Cardano Price Prediction for July 2025 Cardano AI Price Prediction For August 2025 ADA Price Prediction 2025 Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction 2026 ‚Äì 2030 Cardano Price Prediction 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Market Analysis FAQs Cardano Price Today Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $¬†0.82924626 0.62% Market Cap $¬†29,362,360,232.2619 Trading Volume $¬†1,162,377,206.1722 Circulating Supply 35,408,492,715.29 All-time High $3.10 on 02nd Sept 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on 02nd Oct 2017 Cardano Price Prediction for July 2025 After months of stagnation in the first half of 2025, the Cardano price was able to finally break free from its downtrend. The turning point arrived in late June when geopolitical tensions between Iran, Israel, and the US eased, sparking a relief rally across risk-on assets. Seizing this opportunity, Cardano price rebounded impressively, climbing 80% from the $0.55 level to $0.92. Adding to the positive sentiment, Bitcoin also reached a new all-time high of $123,231, injecting momentum into the altcoin market. Cardano has successfully flipped the 200-day EMA into support, and a golden cross between the 50-day and 200-day EMAs has formed, signaling long-term bullish potential. However, as of the fourth week of July, the Cardano price faced a slight sell-off from retail holders, pushing its price below the critical $0.85 mark. While this level has been lost, the breakout remains intact from the falling wedge, as ADA price still holds above the 20-day EMA band and shows some bullishness as it approaches retesting $0.85 again. Interestingly, the recent rejection confirmed the formation of a bullish symmetrical triangle pattern, along with an ongoing falling wedge pattern. If bulls can maintain their momentum and Cardano closes convincingly above $0.85 this time, a near-term move toward $1.10 could be on the horizon. From there, reaching $1.32 in August becomes a realistic target. Nonetheless, support levels are crucial. If ADA slips below $0.70, it could open the door to further declines toward $0.65 or even $0.55, the base that previously fueled its latest rally. As the market evolves, all eyes will be on these key levels to gauge Cardano‚Äôs next move.

Unlike many other blockchains, Cardano gives more control to its users than to any central organization. This is reflected in CoinCarp‚Äôs rich list, where the top 100 addresses hold just 22% of the mainnet‚Äôs circulating supply, significantly lower than most other altcoins. Technically, if ADA price intends for a long-term rally, then a break above the $1.10‚Äì$1.20 range, strong retail participation will be key. A major catalyst could be the approval of an ADA ETF, expected by year-end, which could attract billions in inflows. Another would be a global attraction in the sector with BTC continuing northward moves. Therefore, if ADA holds above its Q1 2025 high, it has a strong chance of retesting the $2.05 mark before the year ends.

2025-07-28T11:07:42,"CZ Binance‚Äôs Net Worth Hits $75B as BNB Token Breaks New ATH Above $850 ‚Äì Richer Than Warren Buffett?","Changpeng Zhao‚Äôs (CZ) net worth has surged to an estimated $75 billion following BNB‚Äôs breakthrough to a new all-time high of $857.18, positioning the Binance founder among the world‚Äôs wealthiest individuals. The cryptocurrency mogul owns approximately 64% of BNB‚Äôs circulating supply, equivalent to roughly 98 million tokens worth $83 billion at current prices. Combined with his 90% ownership stake in Binance, valued at $35 billion, CZ‚Äôs wealth has reached levels that challenge traditional billionaire rankings. CZ Surpasses Tech Giants But Trails Ultra-Wealthy Elite Forbes currently ranks CZ as the 23rd to 25th richest person globally, placing him close behind Facebook‚Äôs Zuckerberg ($245 billion), Google‚Äôs Larry Page and Sergey Brin ($150-160 billion each), and comparable to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer ($144 billion). Source: Forbes Similarly, CZ remains behind the ultra-wealthy elite, including Elon Musk ($400+ billion), Jeff Bezos ($200-240 billion), and Warren Buffett ($144 billion). To surpass Buffett, BNB would need to reach approximately $1,245, representing just a 45% increase from current levels. The milestone coincides with Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance falling 5.8% in one week to under 61% , marking the steepest decline since June 2022 as capital rotates into alternative cryptocurrencies. BNB‚Äôs surge has helped drive the Altseason Index to 51, approaching the 75 threshold that signals the official start of altseason. Path to Surpassing Global Wealth Elite Through BNB Price Targets Mathematical projections based on CZ‚Äôs estimated 98 million BNB holdings and $35 billion Binance equity stake reveal specific price targets needed to surpass the world‚Äôs wealthiest individuals. To surpass Jeff Bezos‚Äôs $240 billion fortune, BNB would need to double in value to approximately $2,328 per token. Surpassing Elon Musk‚Äôs $400 billion+ wealth requires BNB to reach $4,095, while overtaking Bernard Arnault‚Äôs $220 billion+ fortune demands $2,079 per token. These calculations assume Binance‚Äôs equity valuation remains stable at current estimates. Warren Buffett‚Äôs $140 billion net worth represents the most achievable target, requiring BNB to reach $1,245, a modest 45% increase from current levels. Given the volatility of cryptocurrency, this threshold could be crossed within weeks or months during favorable market conditions. CZ‚Äôs wealth composition differs dramatically from that of traditional billionaires, who typically hold diversified portfolios across stocks, real estate, and private companies. His concentrated exposure to BNB creates both massive upside potential and downside risk during market corrections. The Binance founder‚Äôs fortune has grown exponentially since BNB‚Äôs launch at $0.09611 in August 2017, representing gains exceeding 890,000%. This appreciation timeline surpasses even the most successful tech entrepreneurs‚Äô wealth accumulation periods. Corporate Treasury Adoption Fuels BNB‚Äôs Institutional Validation Windtree Therapeutics secured $520 million in funding to build one of the largest corporate BNB treasuries, potentially becoming the first Nasdaq-listed company with direct BNB holdings. The biotechnology firm allocated 99% of the proceeds to acquire BNB cryptocurrency following successful shareholder approval. Similarly, Nano Labs established itself as the first major public company to stockpile BNB at scale, acquiring 74,315 tokens worth $50 million . Announcement #NanoLabs has entered into a $500M convertible notes purchase agreement to launch our $BNB Strategic Reserve. $NA https://t.co/bj4nbzDUrq pic.twitter.com/i3ezU3MrcV ‚Äî Nano Labs (@NanoLabsLtd) June 24, 2025 The Hong Kong-listed firm plans to control 5-10% of BNB‚Äôs circulating supply through a $1 billion accumulation strategy using convertible notes. Build and Build Corp executives also seek $100 million to purchase BNB through a publicly traded company, following the MicroStrategy model, which has been pioneered for Bitcoin accumulation. The initiative targets institutional investors seeking exposure to Binance‚Äôs ecosystem growth and development. Notably, BNB Chain is preparing major infrastructure upgrades , aiming to process 20,000 transactions per second by 2026, with confirmation times under 150 milliseconds. The network will introduce native privacy features and upgradeable virtual machines to support institutional adoption. Technical Breakout Signals $1,000+ Price Target Technical analysis reveals BNB has completed a decisive breakout from a six-month ascending channel that contained price action between $480 and $780. Source: LordOfAlts on X The clean break above $780 triggered a price discovery phase, with the token currently trading at $841.85 after reaching an all-time high of $857.18. Trading volume surged 194.5% to $2.9 billion during the breakout, confirming both institutional participation and retail activity. The ascending channel formation showed methodical accumulation by sophisticated investors, with key support levels at $480, $520, $580, and $650 acting as stepping stones. Previous resistance zones at $680 and $780 have been conquered, clearing the path for continued upward momentum. The breakout into uncharted territory suggests minimal immediate resistance, with psychological levels at $900 and $1,000 representing the next major hurdles. Based on the technical setup and fundamental ecosystem expansion, BNB appears positioned for continued significant upward movement toward $1,000+ targets.

Ethereum price today is exchanging hands at $3888 with $468 Billion market cap, it spiked over 10% in mere 4-days. This spike occurred as it marked the second-highest weekly inflow of $1.846 billion on record in the ETH ETF. This is raising the odds of propelling ETH to the $4,000 mark before July ends. ETF Inflows Signal Strong Institutional Demand According to on-chain and ETF activity data revealed by Ted Pillows , Ethereum ETF inflows have revealed a significant uptrend throughout July. The fourth week of the month saw consistent daily inflows that have crossed the $200 million mark every day. The highest single-day inflow came on July 22, reaching $533.8 million, followed closely by $452.8 million on July 25. Among the nine Ethereum ETFs currently trading, BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale led the charge in institutional accumulation. $ETH ETF inflow + $1,846,500,000 last week. Ethereum to $4,000 this week. pic.twitter.com/eThZ1n3d0y ‚Äî Ted (@TedPillows) July 28, 2025 The magnificent $1.846 billion in weekly inflows represents a dramatic rise compared to early July, showing that market confidence in Ethereum as an investable asset is not just growing but it‚Äôs accelerating hard. This large influx of capital has firmly correlated with a recent strong Ethereum price rally across July and even in the latest week. Now, it is raising optimism that the final week could muster a move toward the much-anticipated $4,000 price for the first time this year. Ethereum Price Action Aligns With Market Rotation Beyond just raw ETF numbers, broader crypto market dynamics are also working in Ethereum crypto‚Äôs favor. Technical patterns shared by Titan of Crypto indicate that Bitcoin crypto‚Äôs market dominance is weakening after rejecting from a monthly symmetrical triangle‚Äôs upper border. This shift signals that capital might be rotating into altcoins, with Ethereum naturally leading the charge. #Altseason loading‚Ä¶ #BTC dominance rolling over. pic.twitter.com/98qrobwEHA ‚Äî Titan of Crypto (@Washigorira) July 28, 2025 Ethereum price today reflects this trend, gaining market share and momentum. This potential altseason scenario strengthens the Ethereum price forecast, suggesting a larger breakout may be underway, which is not just beneficial for ETH but for the broader altcoin sector. Community reactions reinforce this outlook. One user summed up sentiment by saying, ‚ÄúWith that kind of inflow, $4K isn‚Äôt a moonshot, it‚Äôs a pit stop.‚Äù Ted Pillows agreed, replying, ‚ÄúThis is just the start.‚Äù Others echoed similar sentiments, underscoring that the ETF interest is not only sustaining price but potentially igniting a broader bull cycle.

Yet, he reinforced his belief that the Ethereum price chart reflects enough strength to push toward $4,000 in Ethereum price USD. In agreement, community members pointed to the role of institutional demand and the strategic positioning of Ethereum ETFs as powerful catalysts. One supporter noted, ‚ÄúETH leads, alts follow,‚Äù to which Ted responded affirmatively, emphasizing ETH‚Äôs role as the frontrunner of any coming rally.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/ethereum-price-could-hit-4000-as-etf-inflows-surge-past-1-8-billion/,"ETH|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BTC","Price Analysis|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ethereum",cryptocompare

2025-07-28T11:00:44,"Ripple Price Warning: XRP Could Tumble if This Crucial Support Cracks (Analysis)","Following Bitcoin‚Äôs record-breaking rally, Ripple (XRP) has experienced a notable uptrend in recent weeks, establishing a strong bullish market structure across both its USDT and BTC trading pairs. However, the current price action indicates a potential overextension, suggesting a short-term correction or consolidation phase may occur before further upside continuation. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The USDT Pair XRP has recently surpassed the significant $3.30 resistance level against USDT, extending a rally that began in early July. This bullish breakout was triggered by the price moving above both the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, which are now trending upward and forming a bullish crossover near the $2.40 area. These moving averages are likely to act as dynamic support in case of a deeper retracement. Despite the bullish momentum, XRP is showing early signs of rejection at the $3.30 level. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) entered the overbought zone but has since declined below 70, coinciding with the current price pullback. The $3.00 level is now serving as short-term support. If this level holds, it could provide a solid foundation for the next leg up. However, a break below $3.00 could trigger a more pronounced decline toward the $2.40 region, where the aforementioned moving averages converge. The BTC Pair The XRP/BTC chart reflects a similar trend, with Ripple‚Äôs token surging from early July and breaking above the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, both positioned near the 2,400 SAT level. This bullish move was met with resistance at 3,200 SAT, where the rally temporarily stalled. Currently, the market is retesting a bullish fair value gap near the 2,700 SAT area. If this zone provides support, it could serve as a launchpad for another attempt at the 3,200 SAT resistance, with potential for a breakout. Conversely, failure to hold above 2,700 SAT could open the door to a deeper correction, with downside targets around 2,400 SAT or possibly the key 2,000 SAT support level. Overall, while XRP‚Äôs trend remains bullish, short-term caution is warranted due to potential overbought conditions.
