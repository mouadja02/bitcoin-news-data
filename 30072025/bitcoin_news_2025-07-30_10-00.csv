Binance Removes XVS/TRY and YGG/TRY Spot Trading Pairs As a result of these evaluations, some trading pairs may be removed from the list for various reasons such as low liquidity and weak trading volume. Based on Binance's latest assessment, the following TRY-based spot trading pairs will be removed and trading will be suspended on August 1, 2025, at 06:00 (T√ºrkiye time): XVS/TRY YGG/TRY Note: TRY is a fiat currency representing the Turkish Lira and does not represent any digital asset.

2025-07-30T07:37:40,"Turkish Ride-Hailing Giant Marti Announces Crypto Treasury Strategy, Allocates 20% to BTC","Marti Technologies, an Istanbul-based ride-hailing firm, announced that 20% of its cash reserves are allocated to Bitcoin . As a part of its new crypto treasury strategy, the app plans to increase crypto holdings to 50%. Marti is also considering accumulating other digital assets, including Ethereum and Solana , the company said Tuesday . The company plans to purchase these crypto assets as potential long-term stores of value and as a hedge against systemic financial risks. The cryptos will be custodied through a ‚Äúregulated, institutional-grade custodian,‚Äù the firm noted. ‚ÄúOur decision to allocate capital to crypto assets acknowledges our belief that Bitcoin and other digital assets have proven their ability to store value alongside hard currencies and gold over the last several years,‚Äù said CEO Oguz Alper Oktem. Companies Accumulating Crypto is the New Talk of The Town Marti joins the flurry of companies ploughing cash into tokens. Since June, 98 companies have announced plans to raise over‚ÄØ$43‚ÄØbillion to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, crypto advisory firm, Architect‚ÄØPartners, noted . Inspired by the top BTC corporate holder, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), these companies aim to accumulate more BTC per outstanding share over time, rather than simply tracking BTC‚Äôs price. Michael Saylor‚Äôs Strategy currently holds 628,791 BTC, per Bitcoin Treasuries data . The BTC powerhouse recently closed the largest US IPO of 2025 , raising $2.521 billion. Industry skeptics note that the rush of companies buying crypto is a sign the market is overheating. ‚ÄúThe rise of corporate treasury allocations to Bitcoin is significant, but it shouldn‚Äôt be about chasing trends or building oversized positions,‚Äù Seamus Rocca, CEO of Xapo Bank, told Cryptonews. ‚ÄúIt is vital to remember that firms like Strategy and Metaplanet represent high-conviction outliers, headline grabbers with bold strategies that align with their unique business aims. For most, a more measured approach will be better suited,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOne grounded in long-term belief, not short-term reliance on volatility.‚Äù Turkey‚Äôs New Crypto Restrictions Amid Growing Crypto Interest The news arrives at a time when the Turkish crypto market has seen remarkable growth in recent times. The country has seen over half of its population holding crypto, according to a KuCoin survey. Further, Turkey‚Äôs inflationary environment has significantly boosted the use of stablecoins over the past years. Last year, the USDT-TRY was the largest trading pair by volume on Binance with more than $22 billion, according to Kaiko Research . (Source: Kaiko) However, Turkey recently implemented stricter rules for crypto exchanges and investors. The new comprehensive guidelines cover establishment, operations, capital adequacy, and customer protection measures. The strict crypto oversight by Turkey‚Äôs Ministry of Treasury and Finance is a plan to clamp down on illicit financial activities. Besides, the new regulation imposes a delay on crypto asset withdrawals . Any crypto purchased, exchanged, or deposited will be subject to a 48-hour waiting period before it can be withdrawn.

2025-07-30T07:30:35,"Dogecoin Unlock To Put $22.9M Worth Of Tokens Into Circulation","A large number of token unlocks are expected to hit the altcoin market this week, and Dogecoin is one of those with the most notable unlocks happening this week. With the uncertainty in the market, token unlocks like these could affect the Dogecoin price. However, with deep liquidity, there is a high possibility that the meme coin is able to absorb this massive unlock without much effect. Large Dogecoin Unlock To Hit The Market In an X post, Wu Blockchain reported that there are a number of single token unlocks that are set to go live in the altcoin market over seven days. However, the ones of concern are the linear unlocks that will continue into the first week of August, putting hundreds of millions of dollars into the market. Related Reading: XRP Won‚Äôt See Devastating Pullback Because ‚ÄòThe Train Has Left The Station‚Äô One of the major unlocks shown was for Dogecoin, which is supposed to see approximately 95.5 million DOGE tokens added to its supply. Going by the current supply, this would be an additional 0.06% added to the circulating supply. At the current market price, this would be around $22.9 million worth of tokens being added. Naturally, token unlocks can impact the price of a digital asset, and Dogecoin is no different. However, looking at the daily trading volume of the cryptocurrency, which is in the billions of dollars, as well as the deep liquidity across major crypto exchanges, it is likely that the DOGE market will absorb this new supply without much fuss. Additionally, not all of the 95 million tokens will be sent into circulation at once. Given that it‚Äôs a linear unlock, meaning the coins will be released into circulation in smaller batches, it is much easier for the market to absorb the supply without any negative impact to the Dogecoin price. Other Tokens Being Unlocked While the Dogecoin token unlock is significant, it is not the largest token unlock expected to happen this week. The crown goes to Solana, which is expected to see 465,770 tokens unlocked. This stash is worth a staggering $87 million and translates to 0.09% of the total supply. Related Reading: The Days Of Parabolic Bitcoin Bull Runs Are Over: Analyst Reveals How BTC Will Reach $1,000,000 Next on the list is the TRUMP token at 4.89 million tokens worth $50.13 million. This accounts for 1.67% of the total supply. Then, it is followed by¬†Worldcoin (WLD), with an expected 37.23 million tokens to be unlocked, worth $44.67 million, and translates to 2.16% of the total supply. Other major unlocks include TAO with 50,400 tokens worth $21.49 million. There‚Äôs also Avalanche (AVAX) with 700,000 tokens worth $18.07 million, and Celestia (TIA) with 6.96 million tokens worth $14.20 million.

2025-07-30T07:28:49,"Digital Assets Such As XRP Are Being Written Into U.S. Mortgage Law","A new Senate bill introduced by Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) aims to bridge traditional finance and digital assets. The 21st Century Mortgage Act would modernize mortgage eligibility by requiring government-backed entities, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to consider digital assets, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP, when evaluating single-family home loan applications, potentially reshaping access to homeownership. This bill has not gone unnoticed, as Crypto-focused influencer X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) commented on the bill, highlighting XRP‚Äôs inclusion in the proposed mortgage law, and writing, ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt just bullish for XRP. It‚Äôs historic for crypto.‚Äù JUST IN $XRP is being written into US mortgage law A new Senate bill would force Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac to accept digital assets, including XRP, for home loans. They‚Äôre making it mortgage-grade This isn‚Äôt just bullish for $XRP . It‚Äôs historic for crypto Do you see it yet? pic.twitter.com/Fy2Xbofu8D ‚Äî X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) July 29, 2025 Details of the Proposed Mortgage Bill Under the proposed bill, digital assets would be factored into mortgage risk assessments. Specifically, the legislation would require Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to accept digital assets recorded on a distributed ledger, effectively making them financial instruments suitable for use in the home loan process. The legislation also reflects an earlier directive from Federal Housing Finance Agency Director William Pulte, which urged agencies to ‚Äúconsider cryptocurrency as an asset for single-family loans.‚Äù Moving Into a New Age Senator Lummis called the bill a practical response to economic change, noting many young Americans now hold wealth in digital assets. According to Lummis, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre living in a digital age, and rather than punishing innovation, government agencies must evolve.‚Äù This shift may offer a broader on-ramp to financial inclusion, particularly for younger generations whose net worth increasingly includes cryptocurrencies. Lummis is not a supporter of XRP, and previously cancelled a meeting with Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse , refusing to reschedule. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 However, her pro-crypto stance will significantly benefit XRP, despite her preference for Bitcoin. Until now, crypto holdings were excluded from mortgage calculations, limiting the borrowing power of digitally-native consumers. The bill would prevent agencies from requiring applicants to liquidate digital assets into dollars instead of instructing them to assess these holdings in their native form. Garlinghouse, who recently testified before the Senate , has consistently called for an inclusive approach to cryptocurrency integration and use. This bill will provide a framework that will improve the market‚Äôs standing in the U.S. and further legitimize assets like XRP. What‚Äôs Next for XRP and the Broader Market? The bill‚Äôs introduction signals a potential shift in how federal institutions treat decentralized financial technologies. Though it still faces debate and refinement before becoming law, its implications are already resonating in markets and policy circles alike. 2025 has seen major bills, such as the GENIUS Act, passed into law . If passed, this legislation would mark one of the most significant integrations of cryptocurrency into U.S. financial infrastructure to date.

In a new Goldman Sachs podcast, Shah says that despite a risk asset rally in the US and strong fundamentals supporting the uptrend, the ‚Äútechnicals‚Äù do not show an optimistic outlook going forward. ‚ÄúThe risk asset rally, particularly in the US, has been fierce. That recovery from April when we had all that chaos has been strong. I think it‚Äôs been pretty well grounded, earnings have been exceptionally strong. You‚Äôve got the undercurrent of deregulation on its way. Obviously, the AI theme‚Ä¶. I would say that the rally thus far has its strong underpinnings. But I do think the technicals from here are less compelling. There was just a big re-risking from April, retail bought the dip, but our institutional clients definitely got defensive and they had to just chase that rally. But I think a lot of that underweight has been covered. The systematic buying, some of the best of that is behind us. The corporate buying, some of the best of that is behind us too. So I don‚Äôt think the technicals are as favorable from here.‚Äù According to Shah, the signs of a meme stock mania amid ‚Äúflashpoints of froth‚Äù in the market are making him a ‚Äúlittle bit more cautious.‚Äù ‚ÄúNow again, these kind of overshoots can persist for some time. I‚Äôm not saying the structural undercurrents aren‚Äôt still positive. But I do think it is an opportune time to get a bit more defensive.‚Äù A recent Reuters report cited department store chain Kohl‚Äôs, real estate flipper Opendoor Technologies, camera maker GoPro and restaurant chain Krispy Kreme as some of the equities that have poor fundamentals but are nonetheless rallying, driven by social media hype.

2025-07-30T07:04:20,"Bitcoin Miner MARA Beats Q2 Estimates with $238M Revenue Surge","Bitcoin mining giant MARA Holdings reported second-quarter earnings that comfortably beat Wall Street expectations, delivering $238 million in revenue, up 64% year-over-year and above analysts‚Äô forecast of $223.7 million. Key Takeaways: MARA beat Q2 estimates with $238M in revenue and $808M in net income. Its BTC holdings hit 50,000+, worth $5.87B, making MARA the second-largest public Bitcoin holder. The company is expanding into AI infrastructure via partnerships. Net income soared to $808 million, reversing a loss of nearly $200 million in the same quarter last year, the company announced in a Tuesday press release . The jump was driven largely by a $1.2 billion unrealized gain from Bitcoin appreciation, as the asset surged 31% during the three months ending June 30. MARA Shares Jump 7.5% After Earnings Beat, Up 58% Since April MARA shares jumped as much as 7.5% in after-hours trading to $17.82 before settling at $17.22. The stock had closed Tuesday‚Äôs session down 3.2% at $16.61, but is still up 58% since April. The company‚Äôs Bitcoin production increased modestly to 2,358 BTC in Q2, compared to 2,286 BTC in the previous quarter. Its energized hashrate rose 6% to 57.4 EH/s. MARA‚Äôs Bitcoin holdings reached 49,951 BTC by the end of June, a 170% increase year-over-year, valued at $5.3 billion. The firm claims it now ranks second among public companies in Bitcoin holdings, trailing only MicroStrategy‚Äôs 607,770 BTC. Post-quarter, MARA disclosed that its BTC reserves surpassed 50,000, further strengthening its treasury position. As of the latest update, its holdings are valued at approximately $5.87 billion. In a strategic shift, MARA is now expanding its focus beyond mining. The firm announced partnerships with Google-backed TAE Power Solutions and LG-backed PADO AI to co-develop energy-efficient platforms tailored for AI and next-gen data centers.

Iran Cracks Down on Crypto Mining Amid Soaring Power Shortages As reported, Iranian authorities have sounded the alarm over crypto mining‚Äôs impact on the country‚Äôs power grid , claiming it now contributes up to 20% of the national electricity shortfall. With demand peaking during the summer heat, mining operations, many illegal, are consuming nearly 2,000 MW of electricity, equivalent to two nuclear reactors. Officials have stepped up enforcement, seizing over 250,000 unauthorized mining devices across several provinces. A recent internet outage revealed the scale of the problem, temporarily cutting 2,400 MW of consumption as 900,000 devices went offline. To combat the crisis, the government is offering cash rewards for tips on illegal mining farms hidden in homes and factories. Meanwhile, over half of the world‚Äôs Bitcoin mining operations still trace their origins to China , with 55% to 65% of mining linked to Chinese capital, hardware, or expertise, according to Uminers CEO Batyr Hydyrov. Despite China‚Äôs 2021 mining ban, key Chinese players have maintained influence by relocating operations overseas.

2025-07-30T07:00:22,"Stablecoins Clash: South Korea‚Äôs Biggest Parties Propose Rival Legislation","The Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) and the People Power Party (PPP) are reportedly clashing after introducing two bills to regulate stablecoins in South Korea‚Äôs National Assembly, with the two bills differing on a key matter. South Korean National Assembly Divided On Monday, South Korea‚Äôs ruling and opposition parties proposed rival bills to establish a regulatory framework for digital assets pegged to the Korean Won (KRW) amid the ongoing efforts to institutionalize the sector in the coming months. DPK‚Äôs member Ahn Do-gil introduced the ‚ÄúAct on the Issuance and Distribution of Value-Stable Digital Assets.‚Äù At the same time, PPP‚Äôs Kim Eun-hye proposed the ‚ÄúAct on Payment Innovation Using Value-Fixed Digital Assets.‚Äù According to local reports , both bills share several similarities, including the assignment of stablecoin oversight to the Financial Services Commission (FSC). Under the two legislations, the financial regulator would be able to implement measures regarding the issuance, distribution, and redemption of stablecoins and impose emergency rules if it has concerns about market disruption or harm to users. Additionally, issuers would be required to submit a white paper to the FSC before issuance, detailing the issuance limit, distribution plan, structure of reserve assets, and redemption methods. However, the Ministry of Economy and Finance and the Bank of Korea (BOK) will be able to request the data from the FSC or conduct joint inspections to maintain foreign exchange market order or implement monetary policy. DPK‚Äôs Representative also proposed the establishment of a ‚ÄúValue Stability Digital Asset Committee‚Äù with the Ministry of Economy and Finance, the Bank of Korea, and the FSC to discuss related policies. Despite the bill‚Äôs similarities, the two proposed legislation differ in the issue of interest payments. The PPP lawmaker‚Äôs bill would allow interest payments as it could ‚Äúprovide incentives for the use of won-pegged stablecoins abroad.‚Äù Meanwhile, Ahn‚Äôs bill would completely ban interest payments to prevent market disruption. According to the report, some industry players are calling for a unique approach to KRW-based stablecoins, as ‚Äúthe prohibition on paying interest for stablecoins is a measure based on U.S. securities law, so other countries outside the U.S. can design their systems following their own national regulations,‚Äù a crypto industry representative reportedly affirmed. Financial Industry Waiting For Stablecoins Legislation Amid the growing momentum of stablecoins in the country, Min Byeong-deok, a member of the DPK,¬†proposed a comprehensive legislation to establish a more structured regulatory framework for crypto assets in the country. Nonetheless, BOK‚Äôs Governor Lee Chang-yong recently expressed concerns about the potential issuance of stablecoins pegged to the KRW by non-bank entities, arguing that these digital assets could confuse monetary policies and foreign exchange regulations. Some bank officials have told Korean media outlets that the financial institutions are preparing for two legalization scenarios, as it remains unclear whether non-bank entities will be allowed to be stablecoin issuers. As reported by Bitcoinist, the sector is considering a business model in which banks establish a joint venture to collectively issue stablecoins, while also contacting various non-bank companies to prepare for the legalization and issuance of KRW-pegged digital assets. On Tuesday, the Maeil Business Newspaper affirmed that the credit card industry is preparing to apply for trademark rights. According to the news outlet, the Credit Finance Association and eight full-time credit card companies, including Shinhan, Hyundai, Samsung, KB Kookmin, Lotte, Woori, Hana, and BC Card, are preparing to file for trademark rights for the KRW stablecoin under the ‚ÄúCARD KRW‚Äù tentative name. ‚ÄúCredit card companies are expected to play a key role in the KRW stablecoin market. Cards are the most familiar means of payment for consumers.
