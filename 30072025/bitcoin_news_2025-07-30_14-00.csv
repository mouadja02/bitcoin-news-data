2025-07-30T11:45:14,"Cathie Wood‚Äôs ARK Invest Dumps $105,300,000 in Coinbase (COIN) Stock After All-Time High ‚Äì All in Just One Week","The tech-focused investment firm ARK Invest is dumping tens of millions of dollars worth of Coinbase (COIN) shares within a few days after the stock hit a new record high. On July 18th, COIN soared to a new all-time high of $444.65, eclipsing its previous record level of $429, which it hit on April 14th, 2021. Within three days of the rally, ARK Invest began offloading Coinbase shares ‚Äì an aggressive move that knocked COIN from the firm‚Äôs top holding to second place. Data from Cathiesark.com shows that the firm unloaded $105,300,000 worth of COIN from July 21st to 24th. While ARK Invest was selling COIN, it was busy snapping up shares of the electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla (TSLA). The investment firm gobbled up $43.7 million worth of TSLA from July 21st to the 24th. At time of writing, TSLA is the firm‚Äôs top holding, accumulating a $1 billion stake in the Elon Musk-led firm. Coinbase ranks 2nd, with the firm now holding $803.5 million worth of COIN shares. ARK Invest‚Äôs aggressive accumulation of TSLA comes after its CEO, Cathie Wood, predicted that the stock would be worth thousands of dollars by 2030. ‚ÄúOur prediction in five years is $2,600, and 90% of that valuation comes not from the electric vehicle, but from this robotaxi platform. Because the electric car, if you think about it, is a one-shot sale.

2025-07-30T11:44:09,"Cryptos to Buy Before Altcoin Season Explodes Like Bitwise CIO Predicts","Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan predicts that TradFi firms will start scooping up altcoins after making ‚Äòtons of money‚Äô on Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Should that happen, there might not be a better time to learn about the best altcoins to buy now, and get in while their prices are still low. Keep reading for our top three suggestions. Hougan Predicts $BTC to $200K, Altcoin Season Next In a recent interview with The Wolf of All Streets , Hougan explained that institutional investors are now hunting for the next big opportunity beyond $BTC. ‚ÄòAll this money flowed into Bitcoin. The price went up 140%. And what are they going to do? They‚Äôre going to rotate into like Kellogg‚Äôs? No, they‚Äôre going to rotate into Circle, Ethereum, and treasury companies‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs going to go all the way. It‚Äôs altseason in TradFi for sure.‚Äô ‚Äì Hougan. Hougan then went on to discuss how he thinks that ‚ÄòBitcoin is going to $200K by the end of this year‚Äô and that Ethereum is experiencing a massive demand shock due to unprecedented institutional buying. ‚ÄòThere is this supply-demand shock in both Bitcoin and Ethereum. And I didn‚Äôt study that much economics, but I know enough that when demand is 5 to 10x supply, the price tends to go up. And I think that‚Äôs just the story in crypto right now,‚Äô Hougan added. He also pointed out that nearly every day in July saw net inflows into Ethereum ETFs, with over $4.4B pouring in this month alone. As a result, he believes that $ETH has moved from a speculative asset to a must-have for institutional portfolios alongside $BTC. And it‚Äôs no wonder, given the number of institutions accumulating $ETH right now. One such example is blockchain infrastructure firm BTCS Inc., which recently added 14,240 $$ETH to its portfolio . This pushed its total holdings to a hefty 70,028 $ETH, valued at around $270M at the time of purchase. With capital rotating out of $BTC into altcoins, Hougan believes the market is just getting started. While it may feel like we‚Äôre at a peak, he says we‚Äôre ‚Äòactually in the early innings,‚Äô comparing today‚Äôs stance with the early days of the internet boom in 1998. Early-stage altcoins like $BEST , $HYPER , and $ENA are still under the radar. Naturally, this makes now a prime time to invest in them before the broader market catches on and their prices likely shoot up. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) ‚Äì The Foundation of a #1 Anonymous Crypto Wallet $BEST is the native token of Best Wallet , a non-custodial crypto wallet designed to give you complete control over your digital assets. Owing to the fact that it gives you exclusive access to your private keys and doesn‚Äôt require KYC verification, it‚Äôs ranked as our #1 anonymous crypto wallet . The Best Wallet mobile app also leverages Fireblocks Multi-Party Computation (MPC) technology to safeguard your keys while enabling encrypted cloud backups. This also removes the burden of managing seed phrases manually. Security is becoming increasingly vital in the crypto world. This year alone, $2.1B+ worth of crypto has been mostly stolen through private key breaches . Still, Best Wallet has a lot more to offer than urgent safeguarding measures. Its support of 1K+ digital assets, soon across 60 chains, makes it a one-stop powerhouse for crypto. Thanks to its Cross-Chain Swap feature, you can also access 330+ decentralized exchanges and 30+ bridges. Doing so unlocks the best rates and lowest fees when moving assets across networks. And it has tons to look forward to, including Best Card (its own crypto debit card), an NFT gallery, a rewards hub, and market intel analytics. To get the most out of Best Wallet, you‚Äôll want to hold some $BEST. Then, you can enjoy lower transaction fees, governance rights, early entry to the best crypto presales , and staking rewards at a 94%. $BEST has already raised over $14.3M, with one whale investing $49.5K into the project alone. It‚Äôs clear that hype surrounding the Best Wallet ecosystem is building. You can currently buy $BEST on presale for just $0.025405. New developments like Best Card could push its price to $0.072 this year, setting the stage for possible 193%+ gains if you join the action now. 2. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) ‚Äì Layer 2 Solution Set to Upgrade Bitcoin in Q3 2025 Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is the presale token behind a Layer 2 network that will speed up Bitcoin in Q3 2025. It aims to tackle some of Bitcoin‚Äôs most significant limitations by speeding up transactions, slashing fees dramatically, and introducing full smart contract support. To deliver on this, it‚Äôll integrate the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) . This should give it the speed and cost-efficiency of the Solana network, without sacrificing Bitcoin‚Äôs steadfast security. A Canonical Bridge is at the center of it all, allowing you to move $BTC between the Layer 1 and Layer 2 while gaining access to fast and flexible smart contracts. As a consequence, the Layer 2 upgrade will support performance dApps, real-world asset tokenization, and even the best meme coin launches. For extra benefits, including ultra-low fees, staking rewards (currently at a 176% APY), and governance rights, purchase $HYPER on presale for¬†only¬†$0.01245. The project has already raised over $5.8M with whales playing a big role in its early success ‚Äì notable buys include one of $74.9K , $54.1K , and $53.9K. 3. Ethena ($ENA) ‚Äì Breaks Away from Legacy Stablecoins like $USDT & $USDC $ENA is the governance and utility token of Ethena, a crypto-native synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum. The ecosystem offers an alternative to stablecoins like $USDT and $USDC. Its flagship asset, $USDe, is backed by $ETH and $BTC collateral and derivatives to maintain price stability without reliance on centralized banks. Ethena has also introduced the ‚Äò Internet Bond ,‚Äô a dollar-denominated savings product that‚Äôs available worldwide. $ENA gains attention for directing protocol profits toward ecosystem growth, shaping risk management, and enabling holders to vote on the project‚Äôs future trajectory. Consequently, it has spiked by over 109% over the past month. Its price surge aligns with tremendous whale interest. Former BitMEX CEO, Arthur Hayes, for instance, recently acquired 2.16M $ENA worth $1.03M , bringing his total holdings to 7.76M $ENA worth $3.73M (at the time). Given such demand, now signals a fortuitous time to purchase $ENA. It‚Äôs available on some of the best crypto exchanges (including MEXC , Binance , and Bybit ) for roughly $0.57. Verdict ‚Äì An Altcoin Season Looms With TradFi companies investing in crypto beyond crypto and diving into altcoins, we‚Äôre already seeing early signs of an altcoin season looming, just like Hougan predicts. Projects like $BEST , $HYPER , and $ENA are each highly anticipated to soar, owing to their real-world use cases, rising demand, and whale attention. Better still, their prices remain low enough to offer serious gains. So, if you‚Äôre looking to invest in some high-risk, high-reward altcoins, these might be the way to go. This isn‚Äôt investment advice. Always DYOR and don‚Äôt invest more than you‚Äôd be sad to lose.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/cryptos-to-buy-before-altcoin-season-explodes/,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK|AIRDROP|XLM|LTC|CFX|FLOKI|MX|COMMODITY|ONDO|ENA|GALA|BTG|MATIC","Crypto News",cryptocompare
2025-07-30T11:43:12,"Solana Beats Ethereum and Bitcoin in Network Growth ‚Äî Yet Price Stumbles","Solana is leading the pack in network growth, outpacing both Ethereum and Bitcoin in expansion and developer activity. Yet despite this strong on-chain performance, its token price isn‚Äôt following suit‚Äîraising questions about what‚Äôs driving investor sentiment and what‚Äôs holding SOL back. This article explores the divergence between fundamentals and market price, while also assessing Ethereum and Bitcoin‚Äôs latest moves. Just as Solana builds behind the scenes, visibility in the public sphere remains critical. That‚Äôs where Outset PR steps in. By aligning media timing with market momentum, Outset PR helps crypto projects convert performance into perception bridging the gap between value and visibility. Solana's Price on the Rise With Potential to Break Resistance Source: tradingview Solana's price moves between $174 and $205, hinting at potential growth. Despite a recent drop of nearly 8% over the past week, it's up about 20% this month. With the nearest resistance at $220, if Solana breaks this level, it could push towards the next at $251. Current market signals suggest room for upward movement. Solana's 10-day average is slightly below its 100-day average, indicating some fluctuation. However, an RSI value below 50 and a low stochastic reading signal that it may recover. As optimism builds, there's potential for a rise of around 10% or more if it breaks above current barriers. Ethereum's Climb Continues: Could It Hit New Heights Soon? Source: tradingview Ethereum is riding a wave of interest with its price currently between mid-three thousands to four thousand dollars. It has gained over half in value in the past month alone. The coin seems poised for more growth, considering it has already seen an impressive rise of about 21% over the last six months. It currently hovers near a potential hurdle at just above four thousand dollars. If it can pass this, the next target could be close to four and a half thousand dollars. With steady momentum, Ethereum might soon break past these levels, reflecting strong investor confidence and a possible uptrend in the near future.

It's data-backed and insight-driven with just the right level of boutique care. Bitcoin's Future Looks Bright Despite Current Challenges Source: tradingview Bitcoin's price is dancing between $116,040 and $121,488, showing some recent growth. Though it's facing a small hurdle at $123,578, optimism is in the air. Over the past month, Bitcoin rose almost 10%, and in the last six months, it climbed over 13%. If this trend continues, aiming for $129,026 is not outlandish. The momentum indicators are stable, though a bit subdued, hinting at a potential upward move soon. While the RSI stands just under 40, indicating Bitcoin is not overbought, the support at $112,681 provides a safety net. Traders are eyeing these figures, hoping for another rally in the coming weeks. Conclusion Solana‚Äôs growing ecosystem suggests long-term potential, even if the current price lags behind network expansion. Ethereum remains strong with consistent upward pressure, and Bitcoin holds firm as a market bellwether. But in crypto, it‚Äôs not just about who‚Äôs building‚Äîit‚Äôs also about who‚Äôs being seen.

2025-07-30T11:32:41,"AML Bitcoin founder lands jail term for $10M crypto fraud after FBI, IRS investigation","Rowland Marcus Andrade, the founder of AML Bitcoin, will serve a jail term of 84 months for wire fraud and money laundering. The sentence is linked to a $10 million crypto scam. However, the sentencing follows a five-week trial that concluded in March 2025. According to US prosecutors, Andrade misrepresented AML Bitcoin‚Äôs capabilities and promoted fake deals. This includes a completely fabricated claim that the Panama Canal Authority would adopt the token for shipping payments. Meanwhile, no such deal existed, and investors were led to believe they were backing a sophisticated anti-money-laundering crypto innovation. AML Bitcoin founder misled investors In the name of developing tech, Andrade funneled more than $2 million of investor funds into luxury personal expenses. This involves buying two Texas properties and high-end cars while laundering the money through a network of bank accounts. In addition to prison, Andrade faces three years of supervised release. However, a court hearing in September will determine the final forfeiture and restitution amounts. He is scheduled to begin serving his sentence on October 31, 2025. The case was investigated by the FBI and IRS . The prosecution was led by the US Attorney‚Äôs Office for the Northern District of California and the Department of Justice‚Äôs Criminal Division. US Attorney Craig Missakian, while condemning the scheme, mentioned that the defendant made one false claim after another to create the illusion of a legitimate business. FBI Special Agent in Charge Sanjay Virmani highlighted that Andrade promised innovation but delivered deception. He added that the agency is committed to protecting the public from financial fraud and ensuring justice. FBI seizes $2.4M in Bitcoin Recently, the FBI made a clean sweep by seizing over 20 Bitcoins (worth $2.4 million) linked to a ransomware affiliate called ‚ÄúHors‚Äù. This is believed to be part of the Chaos gang, a group with cyber fingerprints all over Texas. The digital bounty was traced to ransomware extortion attacks on companies across the Northern District of Texas. Today, FBI Dallas made public the seizure of over $1.7 million worth of cryptocurrency as part of ongoing efforts to combat ransomware. The seized funds were traced to a cryptocurrency address allegedly associated with a member of the Chaos ransomware group, known as ""Hors,"" who‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/uWeIMMGE9J ‚Äî FBI Dallas (@FBIDallas) July 28, 2025 According to the FBI in Dallas, they made public the seizure of over $1.7 million worth of cryptos as part of efforts to combat ransomware. This Chaos gang is not an ordinary script kiddie outfit, and it reportedly turns out to be a reincarnation of BlackSuit. The crypto was seized back in April, but the DOJ just filed a civil forfeiture complaint claiming permanent ownership of the money. As watchdogs keep on taking over the crime, the digital assets industry enters into a correction period after witnessing long bull rallies. The cumulative crypto market cap turned red but marginally to stand at $3.87 trillion. Bitcoin price is still up by 10% over the last 30 days.

2025-07-30T11:25:10,"Bitcoin Futures: The Calm Before the Storm? Unpacking the Market‚Äôs Next Ascent","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Futures: The Calm Before the Storm? Unpacking the Market‚Äôs Next Ascent Are you feeling the quiet hum in the cryptocurrency market? After periods of intense volatility and speculative frenzy, it appears the Bitcoin market is taking a breather. Specifically, the activity around Bitcoin futures has seen a noticeable cooling, even as prices hover near significant levels like $123,000. This seemingly subdued atmosphere isn‚Äôt a sign of weakness; rather, it could be the strategic pause before Bitcoin embarks on its next exhilarating journey towards new heights. Let‚Äôs delve into what this ‚Äòcooling‚Äô means for the world‚Äôs leading cryptocurrency and what it signals for its future. What‚Äôs Happening with Bitcoin Futures Right Now? The futures market, a crucial barometer for investor sentiment and leverage, has shown a significant reduction in speculative activity surrounding Bitcoin. According to insights from CryptoQuant contributor ShayanMarkets, this cooling indicates a decrease in overall leverage and risk-taking among traders. But what exactly does that entail? Reduced Open Interest: This refers to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts that have not been settled. A decrease suggests fewer new positions are being opened, and existing ones are being closed, indicating a deleveraging event. Lower Funding Rates: In perpetual futures markets, funding rates are periodic payments exchanged between long and short positions. Positive funding rates mean longs pay shorts (indicating bullish sentiment and demand for long positions), while negative rates mean shorts pay longs. Lower or even negative funding rates suggest less aggressive long-side speculation. Diminished Premium: The difference between the futures price and the spot price (known as the basis or premium) tends to shrink during a cooling period. A high premium indicates strong bullish sentiment and a willingness to pay more for future exposure, whereas a low premium suggests a more balanced or even bearish outlook. This collective reduction in these metrics paints a picture of a market that is shedding its excess baggage of over-leveraged positions. Think of it like a race car pitting for a tire change and fuel refill ‚Äì it‚Äôs not stopping because it‚Äôs broken, but rather preparing for the next high-speed lap. Why Does a Cooled Bitcoin Futures Market Matter? While some might interpret reduced activity as a lack of interest, in the context of cryptocurrencies, it‚Äôs often a healthy sign. The cryptocurrency market, especially Bitcoin, has a history of dramatic rallies often preceded by periods of consolidation and deleveraging. Here‚Äôs why this cooling trend in Bitcoin futures is significant: Clearing the Path for Organic Demand When the market is flushed with high leverage, even small price movements can trigger large liquidations, creating cascading sell-offs. This volatility, while exciting, isn‚Äôt sustainable for long-term growth. A reduction in leverage means: Less Volatility from Liquidations: With fewer over-leveraged positions, the market becomes less susceptible to sudden, sharp drops caused by liquidation cascades. Focus on Spot Buying: When futures speculation subsides, the market‚Äôs price discovery relies more heavily on actual buying and selling of Bitcoin on spot exchanges. This ‚Äòorganic demand‚Äô comes from genuine investors who are accumulating Bitcoin for its long-term value, rather than short-term speculative gains. Stronger Foundations: A market driven by organic demand builds a more robust and sustainable price floor. It signifies conviction from long-term holders and new entrants who believe in Bitcoin‚Äôs fundamental value proposition. This shift from speculative-driven price action to demand-driven growth is crucial for establishing a solid foundation for future price appreciation. It suggests that current price support is coming from genuine interest, not just leveraged bets. Is This the Precursor to a New Bitcoin All-Time High? The sentiment from experts like ShayanMarkets suggests that this market reset could indeed pave the way for a new all-time high for Bitcoin. Historically, significant price rallies have often followed periods where the market ‚Äòcleansed‚Äô itself of excessive speculation. Consider the following points: Historical Precedent: If we look back at previous bull cycles, such as those in 2017 and 2021, there were often mid-cycle corrections or consolidation phases where leverage was flushed out. These periods, though painful for some traders, ultimately served as springboards for the next leg up. The current scenario with Bitcoin futures shows similar characteristics: Market Phase Futures Market Behavior Typical Outcome Early Bull Run / Initial Rally Rising open interest, positive funding rates, high premium. Rapid price appreciation, increased volatility. Mid-Cycle Consolidation / Correction Cooling open interest, funding rates normalize or turn negative, premium shrinks. Price stabilizes or pulls back, leverage reduced, market reset. Post-Consolidation Rally Open interest rises organically, funding rates remain healthy, strong spot demand. Sustainable price appreciation, potential new all-time highs. The current situation aligns closely with the ‚ÄòMid-Cycle Consolidation‚Äô phase, setting the stage for the ‚ÄòPost-Consolidation Rally‚Äô. Macroeconomic Factors and Institutional Interest Beyond the futures market, several other factors could contribute to Bitcoin‚Äôs next rally: Spot ETF Inflows: The approval and subsequent inflows into Bitcoin Spot ETFs have introduced a new class of institutional investors to the market, providing a consistent source of demand. Halving Event Impact: While the immediate impact of the halving may not be seen, its long-term effect of reducing the supply of new Bitcoin often contributes to price appreciation over time. Global Economic Uncertainty: In times of economic instability, Bitcoin often acts as a safe haven asset, attracting investors looking to hedge against inflation or traditional market volatility. While past performance is not indicative of future results, the confluence of a healthy futures market reset and supportive macroeconomic factors creates a compelling narrative for Bitcoin‚Äôs upward trajectory. Navigating the Next Rally: Actionable Insights for Bitcoin Investors For both seasoned traders and newcomers, understanding these market dynamics is key. Here are some actionable insights to consider as the market prepares for its next potential surge: Focus on Long-Term Accumulation: If the market is indeed entering a phase driven by organic demand, ‚Äòdollar-cost averaging‚Äô (DCA) into Bitcoin can be a sound strategy. This involves investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price fluctuations, to reduce overall risk. Manage Your Leverage: The cooling of Bitcoin futures serves as a powerful reminder of the risks associated with excessive leverage. Traders should exercise caution and manage their risk exposure diligently, especially during periods of high volatility. Stay Informed, But Avoid Hype: While exciting, new all-time highs can often lead to irrational exuberance. Base your decisions on fundamental analysis and market indicators, rather than speculative hype. Consider Diversification (Carefully): While Bitcoin is the focus, a well-rounded crypto portfolio might include other strong assets. However, ensure you understand the risks associated with each. Secure Your Assets: As your portfolio potentially grows, ensuring the security of your Bitcoin through hardware wallets or reputable exchanges becomes even more critical. This period of calm in the futures market offers a unique opportunity for investors to reassess their strategies and position themselves for what could be a significant phase of growth for Bitcoin. The market is not merely pausing; it is recalibrating, strengthening its foundations for a more sustainable ascent. The Strategic Pause: Setting the Stage for Bitcoin‚Äôs Ascent The cooling of the Bitcoin futures market, as highlighted by CryptoQuant contributor ShayanMarkets, is far from a bearish signal. Instead, it represents a crucial and healthy deleveraging event, paving the way for a more sustainable and organic rally. By shedding excess speculative positions, Bitcoin is building a stronger foundation, relying on genuine demand rather than precarious leveraged bets. This strategic pause is a testament to the market‚Äôs natural cycles of growth and consolidation, and it sets a compelling stage for Bitcoin to potentially breach new all-time highs. For investors, this period offers a valuable opportunity to refine strategies, manage risk, and prepare for what could be another remarkable chapter in Bitcoin‚Äôs journey. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does ‚Äòcooling of Bitcoin futures‚Äô mean? It means there‚Äôs a reduction in speculative activity and leverage in the Bitcoin derivatives market. This is indicated by lower open interest, normalized funding rates, and a shrinking premium between futures and spot prices, suggesting less aggressive risk-taking by traders. Q2: Why is reduced leverage considered a positive sign for Bitcoin? Reduced leverage makes the market less susceptible to sudden price crashes caused by liquidation cascades. It shifts the focus from speculative trading to organic demand from long-term investors, creating a more stable and sustainable foundation for price growth. Q3: How does ‚Äòorganic demand‚Äô differ from speculative demand? Organic demand comes from investors who buy Bitcoin on spot markets with a long-term holding perspective, believing in its fundamental value. Speculative demand, often seen in futures markets, involves traders taking short-term leveraged positions to profit from price fluctuations, which can be highly volatile. Q4: Does a cooled futures market guarantee a new Bitcoin all-time high? While historical patterns suggest that deleveraging often precedes significant rallies, no market outcome is guaranteed. However, a healthy futures market reset, combined with other bullish factors like institutional adoption and the halving event, creates a strong probabilistic case for future price appreciation. Q5: What should investors do during this period of market cooling? Investors should consider strategies like dollar-cost averaging, carefully managing their leverage, staying informed with reliable sources, and ensuring the security of their assets. It‚Äôs a time for strategic positioning rather than panic or excessive risk-taking. If you found this article insightful, please consider sharing it with your network!

2025-07-30T11:16:29,"Risky Hyperliquid trader James Wynn lost almost all the $1.28M he deposited in July","James Wynn, one of the high-profile traders on Hyperliquid, deposited a total of $1.28M to Hyperliquid to defend his positions during a turbulent month, and lost almost all of the funds to liquidations. James Wynn kept defending risky positions on Hyperliquid, costing him a total of $1.28M for the past month. During the market turbulence in July, Wynn had to post additional collateral to avoid full liquidation. Despite this, Wynn has been liquidated on most of his BTC longs, which were made just as BTC prices peaked. The positions were closed after Hyperliquid had a 27-minute outage of its API and order books. On-chain data gathered by Arkham Intelligence shows James Wynn was highly active in moving funds, with Hyperliquid as one of the main destinations. Wynn took out around $32K from Hyperliquid, later depositing the funds to Binance in the form of USDC. JAMES WYNN DEPOSITED $1.28M TO HYPERLIQUID THIS MONTH ‚Äì AND LOST EVERYTHING James Wynn deposited a total of $1.28M to Hyperliquid over the course of July, and has since lost all of it, withdrawing a final balance of $32.93K. James Wynn was liquidated last night for his $2.99M‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/vOyuU8MmlO ‚Äî Arkham (@arkham) July 30, 2025 Wynn also interacts with Binance, as well as the 1inch aggregator for decentralized meme trading. The risky trader actively shares his positions on social media, with several risky longs for BTC and ETH. In addition to trading blue chip tokens, Wynn is also shilling meme tokens on Telegram and going for small-scale meme trades. James Wynn loses on PEPE bets Following several BTC and ETH liquidations, James Wynn switched his attention to PEPE. The early meme token, PEPE gained 16.3% in July, but failed to go vertical. James Wynn was liquidated partially nine times in a row in his PEPE position, before closing the long. | Source: Hyperliquid PEPE has been sliding in the second half of the month, trading at $0.000011. The lack of a decisive rally led to multiple partial liquidations. On-chain data reveals James Wynn was liquidated a total of nine times on his PEPE positions, losing another $25,000. The PEPE position was relatively minor compared to previous bets on the direction of BTC and ETH, but James Wynn tried to boost the social media profile of the meme token. The trader has a long history with PEPE, becoming an early adopter while the token had a $600M market cap. Hyperliquid still attracts star whales Star whales like James Wynn and Aguila Trades have become the key to Hyperliquid‚Äôs success. The model of James Wynn has also been copied by The White Whale, another top-ranked Hyperliquid trader. In addition to opening public positions, The White Whale is active on social media, with potential effect on asset prices. That moment you realize that single-handedly you are 15% of all OI for SOL on Hyperliquid. Guess it makes sense why price is being suppressed. Not sure who needs to hear this but you aren't going to shake my conviction and trick me into selling before I'm good and ready. ‚Äî The White Whale (@TheWhiteWhaleHL) July 29, 2025 The perpetual futures DEX expanded its open interest to over $15B, of which $8B goes toward blue-chip assets, and the remainder to new hot tokens. HYPE is among the most active markets, but Hyperliquid has quickly gathered whales for new listings like PUMP. Hyperliquid‚Äôs open interest grew vertically, driven by altcoin inflows. Open interest is at an all-time high above $15B. | Source: Hyperliquid Despite the most recent BTC slide to $117,000, Hyperliquid managed to hold up. HYPE stabilized around $43.07, down from its peak of just under $50. For now, HYPE has not managed a rally to three-digit prices and failed to clear the $50 barrier, but is still up over 8% in July.

2025-07-30T11:02:14,"Company Raises Another 5,800 Bitcoins in ‚ÄòGold Rush‚Äô ‚Äì Here‚Äôs Why $HYPER Is a Great Buy Now","Twenty One Capital, a corporate Bitcoin treasury seeking public listing on the US stock exchange, has announced that they‚Äôre increasing their holdings by 5,800 Bitcoins. That puts their overall holdings at ~$5.1B, making them the third largest corporate Bitcoin holder . Currently, only Strategy and Mara Holdings own more Bitcoin at 628,791BTC and 50,000BTC respectively. This is fantastic news if you‚Äôre a long-term Bitcoin investor. It proves that Bitcoin is being taken seriously in the corporate world. But Bitcoin is quite pricey now, and in that case, it‚Äôs worth taking a look at Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), a new crypto presale. The project wants to upgrade the Bitcoin blockchain to modern standards ‚Äì add dApp and smart contract compatibility, for one. Given the current bullish state of affairs, we believe $HYPER is looking at an explosive future. Why Is Twenty One‚Äôs Acquisition Good for Bitcoin? The team behind Twenty One Capital is confident that Bitcoin is the future of digital currency. We believe Bitcoin deserves a public company worthy of its ethos. Twenty One is a new kind of public company: built on Bitcoin, backed with proof, and driven by a vision to reshape the global financial system. We‚Äôre not here to beat the existing system, we‚Äôre here to build a new one. ‚ÄîJack Mallers, Twenty One CEO, Twenty One Capital PR As a publicly traded company, Twenty One Capital will trade under the ‚ÄòXXI‚Äô ticker. Traders will be able to track its performance with a ‚ÄòBitcoin per Share‚Äô metric provided by Twenty One Capital. And on-chain proof of the company‚Äôs Bitcoin holdings is available via xxi.mempool.space , providing full transparency for investors. It‚Äôs pretty clear that confidence in Bitcoin is growing by the day. This much institutional adoption signals that it‚Äôs not just a speculative asset, but a long-term store of value that can perform better than traditional assets. Case in point, Bitcoin grew by 77% in the last year , from ~$66K to $118K today, reaching an ATH of $123K in July. Some traders are even beginning to think of Bitcoin as the equivalent of digital gold. Bitcoin companies like Twenty One Capital adopting a Bitcoin-heavy portfolio shows that there‚Äôs a bright future for Bitcoin, as well as projects that seek to expand the reach or functionality of the Bitcoin network. Projects like Bitcoin Hyper, which plans to upscale the Bitcoin blockchain to modern, 21st century standards. Why Bitcoin Hyper? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER ) is the solution to woes that have been plaguing the Bitcoin network for over a decade. While Bitcoin is a great store of value, transactions are processed relatively slowly (around 7/second vs Tron‚Äôs 2,000/second, for instance) and at greater cost compared to newer blockchains like Solana and Ethereum. Bitcoin Hyper promises to solve all these problems by bridging the Bitcoin blockchain to a Layer 2 solution built on the Solana Virtual Machine , unlocking powerful smart-contract capabilities for Bitcoin-based dApps. Through a Canonical Bridge, you‚Äôll be able to lock in your Bitcoins and receive equivalent wrapped Bitcoin on the L2. You can change back to $BTC whenever you want to. The gist of it is that $HYPER will process transactions on the much faster L2 and execute them on Bitcoin‚Äôs L1. This way, you get both speed and security under the hood. The presale has already attracted over $5.8M, signalling confidence in Bitcoin Hyper‚Äôs proposed solutions to hyper-charge the Bitcoin Network. With a mainnet launch in Q3 2025, now‚Äôs the perfect time to check out the Bitcoin Hyper project. $HYPER holders also receive voting rights for governance proposals, lower transaction fees across the Bitcoin Hyper network, and a lucrative staking opportunity currently valued at 176% APR. The token is currently worth $0.01245 (and we expect it to jump to $0.08625 by the end of 2025 ), and you can buy it from the official presale page . Summary As more financial institutions turn their eye towards Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, early adopters get to ride the price higher and higher. It‚Äôs no longer about speculation. Holding firms like Strategy, Twenty One Capital, and even Trump Media are leaning into the rock-solid value Bitcoin provides as an asset. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs time to get on board and ride the rocketship. While Bitcoin might not have the same explosive potential it had a decade ago, it‚Äôs also significantly less risky to bet on a crypto backed by billions of dollars worth of capital funds. However, Bitcoin isn‚Äôt a perfect solution‚Äîyet. Bitcoin Hyper looks set to fix the outstanding issues with the Bitcoin Network and pump while doing so. Remember to do your own research and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Presales are very volatile, and price movements can appear suddenly. Take care!",newsbtc,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/twenty-one-reaches-5-1-billion-bitcoin-treasury-boosts-hyper/,"BTC|FIAT|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|TRADING","Cryptocurrency Market News",cryptocompare
2025-07-30T11:00:40,"Analyst Says Everyone Is Wrong about XRP‚Äôs Price. Here‚Äôs Why","Crypto analyst STEPH IS CRYPTO has reignited bullish sentiment around XRP , declaring that ‚Äúeveryone is wrong‚Äù about its current price trajectory. In a new technical breakdown shared via X, Steph argues that XRP is nearing a critical breakout moment on its long-term chart, one that could drive exponential growth through the rest of 2025. However, while his analysis focuses on an emerging bullish structure, some of the associated claims about XRP‚Äôs price levels require careful clarification. The Chart Pattern Everyone Missed According to Steph, XRP has been following an ascending resistance trendline on its monthly time frame since 2021. This line has been respected with multiple touches over the years, and he believes XRP is now approaching a crucial inflection point. ‚ÄúThe moment we break this trendline,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs lights out. Fireworks for XRP.‚Äù EVERYONE IS WRONG ABOUT #XRP 'S PRICE‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/Kb5zGsk7nw ‚Äî STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) July 29, 2025 To support his claim, Steph compares XRP‚Äôs current setup to Bitcoin‚Äôs chart from 2021, which showed a similar three-touch trendline structure. Bitcoin broke out decisively from that pattern, and Steph suggests XRP may be poised to do the same, potentially igniting a similar rally. The $3.28 Breakout Threshold Steph identifies $3.28 as the ‚Äúline in the sand‚Äù for XRP. A monthly candle close above this level, he says, would confirm a breakout from the multi-year trendline and signal the beginning of a sustained upward move. Notably, XRP surged as high as $3.65 on July 18, 2025, surpassing its previous all-time high; however, it has since pulled back. As of report time, XRP is trading at $3.10 with intraday swings between $3.06 and $3.17. The asset would require a minimum of 6% rise to break the threshold identified by Steph. Momentum from Korea and Institutional Tailwinds Steph also points to significant buying pressure coming from South Korean exchanges. This regional demand has helped fuel XRP‚Äôs recent gains, with volumes surging over the past month. More importantly, institutional interest continues to build. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Bloomberg analysts now give a 95% probability that an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) could be approved by 2025 . This would mark a significant milestone for XRP, opening the door to billions in institutional capital. Combined with Ripple‚Äôs growing footprint in global finance and increasing adoption of XRP Ledger solutions, the long-term outlook appears strong. What Comes Next As July comes to a close, all eyes are on whether XRP can end the month above $3.28. A confirmed breakout at this level would strengthen the case for a sustained rally into Q3 and beyond. Steph remains confident: ‚ÄúThe third quarter could be huge for altcoins, and XRP is positioned better than most. The market is still asleep, and that‚Äôs when the biggest moves tend to happen.‚Äù Whether XRP breaks out this month or later, one thing is clear: the chart is tightening, momentum is building, and the market is paying attention.

2025-07-30T11:00:09,"BlackRock Goes Heavy on Ethereum: Buys 4x More ETH Than BTC","Ethereum has entered a volatile and decisive phase following weeks of strong buying pressure and rapid price appreciation. After pushing above $3,800, ETH is now facing resistance, with bulls stepping in to defend key lower demand zones. The market appears uncertain, caught between a potential continuation toward new highs and the risk of a broader cooldown. Related Reading: Abraxas Capital Faces $100M Unrealized Loss On $800M Crypto Short Positions ‚Äì Details Adding to the momentum, new data from Arkham reveals that BlackRock purchased over four times more Ethereum than Bitcoin last week. This shift marks a significant moment for institutional involvement in Ethereum and signals growing confidence in its long-term potential. Analysts across the industry are beginning to take note, interpreting the move as a signal that Ethereum may be gaining favor among traditional finance giants. As Bitcoin consolidates near all-time highs, Ethereum now stands at a crossroads. Will it continue climbing and close the gap, or will rejection above $3,800 mark the beginning of a local top? BlackRock‚Äôs Ethereum Allocation Signals Growing Institutional Shift Arkham data has revealed a significant development in institutional crypto allocation: BlackRock purchased over $1.2 billion worth of Ethereum last week, compared to just $267 million in Bitcoin. This 4.5x disparity signals a decisive shift in institutional strategy, with capital now flowing more aggressively into ETH than BTC. For many in the market, this is what true institutional Ethereum adoption looks like‚Äîmassive inflows that reshape market dynamics. This shift didn‚Äôt start overnight. Institutional interest in Ethereum began building back in April, when ETH hit a cycle low near $1,380. Since then, a combination of legal clarity, progress around ETF approval, and Ethereum‚Äôs maturing role in the financial ecosystem has fueled a steady wave of accumulation from large players. BlackRock‚Äôs latest allocation is simply the most visible and significant confirmation of that trend. As the broader crypto market heats up, Ethereum appears well-positioned to continue its upward trajectory. However, not everything is straightforward. ETH is now struggling to break through resistance around the $3,800 level, and the failure to reclaim new highs is beginning to stir uncertainty. Some analysts warn that the current rally may lose steam without a breakout, and fear of a short-term correction is growing. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Begin Distribution: Mirroring Fall 2024 Cycle ETH Faces Key Resistance After Parabolic Rally Ethereum has staged an impressive rally over the past few weeks, surging from sub-$2,000 levels to a current price of $3,782.61. The weekly chart shows a strong bullish breakout from the $2,852.16 resistance zone, with ETH now approaching a critical barrier near $3,860.80. Price briefly reached a high of $3,941.86 before pulling back, signaling potential short-term exhaustion after an aggressive upside move. Volume has increased significantly during this breakout, confirming strong buying interest. The 50, 100, and 200-week SMAs‚Äîall converging around $2,700‚Äì$2,850‚Äînow serve as key support, reinforcing the strength of the breakout. As long as ETH remains above the $2,850 level, the broader structure remains bullish. Related Reading: TRON Sees $1B USDT Mint: Liquidity Wave Incoming? However, the current pause below $3,860 suggests indecision as bulls encounter historical resistance. A clean weekly close above this level could open the door to a continuation toward $4,200‚Äì$4,400. On the downside, a rejection followed by a drop below $3,500 may trigger a short-term correction as traders secure profits.

2025-07-30T11:00:00,"Wall Street Meets Web3: Institutions Pour Into Bitcoin Swift for Unmatched Privacy and Compliance","Bitcoin Swift (BTC3) is not just refining how networks reward users. It is overhauling broken incentive structures entirely. By using programmable Proof-of-Yield, BTC3 shifts rewards away from static models and toward real-time metrics that prioritize sustainability and network contribution. This evolution is why institutions are paying attention. The market is shifting hard toward automated, compliant infrastructure that can scale. Bitcoin Swift is leading that wave with what is quickly becoming the most utility-driven presale in Web3 today. Enterprise-Ready PoY and Exploding Interest Unlike the outdated reward systems that depend on power and hash rate, Bitcoin Swift‚Äôs Proof-of-Yield dynamically adapts based on energy use, network demand, and governance votes. This makes the system predictable, fair, and transparent, exactly what institutional investors look for. Influencers are helping push this awareness to the public. A breakdown by Crypto Infinity and Crypto Vlog , along with content from Token Empire, Crypto Sister, and Crypto League, showcases why Bitcoin Swift is trending across social channels and investor forums. AI-Powered Energy Efficiency BTC3 integrates federated AI oracles that constantly monitor the network‚Äôs carbon usage and efficiency. Users contributing through low-impact systems receive better PoY distribution. The reward engine reacts in real time and penalizes high-consumption setups. This gives Bitcoin Swift a built-in sustainability model that goes far beyond marketing. And it is verified. The Spywolf Audit , Solidproof Audit , and KYC certification all confirm BTC3‚Äôs commitment to operational transparency and compliance from day one. BTC3E Stablecoin and Vault Architecture BTC3 also powers BTC3E, a USD-pegged stablecoin backed by locked BTC3 inside smart contract vaults. Each unit is overcollateralized at a ratio of at least one hundred fifty percent. If collateral drops, liquidation is triggered automatically by the protocol. AI price oracles monitor asset values and update the contract parameters to protect the peg. This system is designed for stability under volatility, enabling fast, trusted transactions. Learn more at the official Bitcoin Swift Website or follow daily updates via X . Reward Logic: Structured and Transparent Unlike generic airdrops, BTC3‚Äôs staking rewards are programmed, timed, and performance-based. Smart contracts track user behavior and distribute PoY rewards at the end of each presale stage. There is no delay and no guesswork. This creates a structured, reliable experience where returns are tied to contribution and ecosystem growth. Institutions value consistency and clarity, and Bitcoin Swift delivers both through fully transparent code and rules. Tokenomics: Designed for Long-Term Sustainability Bitcoin Swift has a fixed total supply of 45 million tokens. The distribution reflects a focus on utility and decentralization rather than hype: 50% or 22.5 million BTC3 is allocated to Proof-of-Yield rewards, distributed over 30 years 30% or 13.5 million BTC3 goes to presale participants, granting them early ecosystem access 15% is allocated for liquidity provisioning across exchanges 5% is set aside for additional reserves and project team operations This model ensures long-term network alignment while giving early adopters real utility and governance access from day oneBtc3 Condensed Whitepaper. Presale Snapshot: One Of The Shortest Presales To Exist Bitcoin Swift is currently in Stage 2 of its 64-day presale, ending on September 18, 2025. The token is now priced at $2, with only 2 days left before the next price increase, with Stage 3 increasing to $3. The confirmed public launch price is $15, representing significant upside for early participants. BTC3 will launch on Orca , one of Solana‚Äôs most active DEX platforms. During Stage 2, PoY rewards yield a 133% APY, automatically distributed at the end of the stage. This is one of the shortest, most utility-backed presales on the market, and institutions are taking notice. Conclusion Bitcoin Swift is not just gaining traction. It is becoming a cornerstone of the compliance-ready blockchain movement. With programmable income, AI automation, identity privacy, and vault-backed stablecoins, BTC3 offers a complete foundation for institutional and retail adoption alike. Early participants are not betting on hype. They are securing a position inside a working protocol that rewards contribution, enforces sustainability, and scales with real-world needs. BTC3 is more than a coin. It is the engine of programmable DeFi.
