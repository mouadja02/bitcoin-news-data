The offering generated gross proceeds of approximately $2.52 billion, making it the largest US IPO of 2025.

It will also be the first short-duration, income-oriented instrument within Strategy‚Äôs lineup of preferred offerings. The company said the deal also represents the largest exchange-listed perpetual preferred stock issuance in the US since 2009. Morgan Stanley, Barclays, Moelis & Company, and TD Securities acted as joint book-running managers for the offering, while The Benchmark Company, Clear Street, AmeriVet Securities, Bancroft Capital, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, and Maxim Group LLC served as co-managers.

2025-07-30T05:51:08,"Developers Made a Large Token Buyback in This Altcoin ‚Äì But Controversy Has Begun","A hotly debated topic in the cryptocurrency market in recent days has been the token buyback strategy of memecoin launch platform PumpFun. On-chain analysis suggests that the platform spent 100% of its daily revenue on PUMP token buybacks for just one day. However, there are serious doubts that this approach is unsustainable. Related News: BREAKING: Historic Moment - SEC Approves In-Kind Redemptions for Bitcoin and Ethereum Spot ETFs Market rumors suggest that PumpFun plans to increase its buyback rate and use all of its daily revenue to support the PUMP token. However, decentralized community Dumpster DAO has cautioned against these claims. The DAO urged the community to carefully monitor on-chain data, noting that the platform had only fully implemented this strategy for one day previously. It's also noted that not all of the funds allocated that day have yet been redeemed. This has raised some suspicions that the platform is attempting to mislead on-chain observers. The redeemed tokens were not burned or transferred to another address, making it unclear whether these transactions were truly completed. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-30T05:30:00,"Firms Snap Up 1% of Ethereum Supply Since June","This surge in institutional demand is fueled by strong ETF inflows, as well as ETH‚Äôs staking and DeFi utility. It also contributed to Ethereum‚Äôs recent price outperformance. Major players like BitMine Immersion Technologies, Sharplink, and newcomer Ether Machine are leading the charge, collectively amassing over 1.4 million ETH. Standard Chartered predicts that corporate entities could eventually hold up to 10% of ETH‚Äôs total supply. Corporations Race to Buy Ethereum Corporations are increasingly turning their attention to Ethereum, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, as a preferred treasury asset. A new report by Standard Chartered revealed that Ethereum-focused treasury firms acquired 1% of ETH‚Äôs total supply since the beginning of June 2025. Over the same period, these firms doubled the pace of investment compared to their Bitcoin-focused counterparts. This contributed a lot to Ethereum‚Äôs outperformance against Bitcoin. ETH held by Ethereum treasury companies (Source: Standard Chartered) This growing appetite for ETH among institutional investors is being attributed to several key drivers. Standard Chartered mentioned that strong inflows into US spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), alongside robust corporate demand, fueled the recent gains in ETH‚Äôs price. Although Ethereum is still trading more than 21% below its all-time high of $4,890 that was reached in November 2021, the bank still has a bullish year-end price target of $4,000 and suggests that continued accumulation could drive prices even higher. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum offers additional yield-generating opportunities through staking and decentralized finance (DeFi). Standard Chartered pointed out that corporate ETH treasuries can capitalize on both, unlike Ethereum ETFs in the US, which are currently restricted from participating in staking. This gives Ethereum a unique edge as a treasury asset, and the bank predicts that these firms could eventually control up to 10% of the entire ETH supply. This is a tenfold increase from current holdings. BitMine Immersion Technologies is the largest corporate holder of Ethereum, as it now holds about 625,000 ETH‚Äîabout 0.52% of the circulating supply. The company announced a $1 billion stock repurchase plan, and plans to increase its ETH holdings to 5% of the total supply. Close behind is Sharplink, a Nasdaq-listed firm that recently spent $290 million to acquire over 438,000 ETH in less than a week. A new player, the Ether Machine, also announced plans to build one of the largest on-chain ETH treasuries, targeting more than 400,000 ETH worth $1.5 billion and a future listing under the ticker ‚ÄúETHM.‚Äù Collectively, these moves suggest that institutional conviction in Ethereum‚Äôs long-term value proposition is stronger than ever.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/10250/firms-snap-up-1-of-ethereum-supply-since-june,"ETH|TRADING|REGULATION|TREASURY|BTC","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

The company said it planned to increase this allocation to 50% soon. Marti‚Äôs announcement mentioned that the crypto assets would be held through a regulated custodian with institutional-grade compliance. The firm‚Äôs CEO, Oguz Oktem, said his company viewed crypto assets as stores of value for long-term hedging. The company disclosed that its crypto reserve strategy was not expected to interfere with its other business activities. The current execution of business operations and plans will continue as scheduled. Oktem says the Bitcoin plan mitigates fiat currency risks The company‚Äôs founder and CEO said his firm‚Äôs Bitcoin strategy was aimed at mitigating risks associated with hard currencies. He added that all crypto asset acquisitions would be held indefinitely, with plans to keep stockpiling on different crypto assets like Solana and Ethereum in the future. Marti‚Äôs financial reports showed that the company had surpassed its 2025 targets, reaching over 2 million riders and over 300K drivers as of June this year. The milestone marked an 8.3% increase in registered drivers and a 12.7% rise in the number of riders since March. The company has successfully completed over 35 million rides. ‚ÄúWe believe this strategy represents a prudent approach to treasury management, particularly in the current economic environment which carries both inflationary and hard currency risks.‚Äù ‚Äì Oguz Oktem , Founder and CEO at Marti Technologies In the press release, the company promised to disclose any further developments regarding its crypto assets reserve strategy. It also mentioned that its new treasury strategy would be executed alongside its traditional holdings in cash, cash equivalents, and securities. The crypto allocations would also apply to surplus cash reserves, not funds needed for everyday running expenses. Marti dominates tech-enabled transportation services The ride-hailing company disclosed that it managed a fleet of EVs for hire, including e-mopeds, e-scooters, and e-bikes across the country‚Äôs major cities. It provides its tech-enabled transportation services through a mobility app. Marti went public in July 2023, becoming the first micro-mobility company based in Turkey to be listed in the United States. Following news of the crypto reserve adoption strategy, its shares surged 7% on July 29 . However, the price hike didn‚Äôt last as the stock prices quickly plummeted again by 6.7%. The company joined a growing list of public companies that added crypto assets to their balance sheets. It recently announced plans to expand its coverage across Turkish cities. The company currently covers Ankara, Istanbul, Antalya, and Izmir. It will soon broaden its reach to the cities of Konya, Kayseri, Kocaeli, Bursa, Mersin, and Adana.

2025-07-30T05:00:12,"Bitcoin Holdings: Twenty One Capital‚Äôs Astounding Reveal Shakes Up Corporate Ranks","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Holdings: Twenty One Capital‚Äôs Astounding Reveal Shakes Up Corporate Ranks A seismic shift is underway in the world of institutional cryptocurrency investment. For years, companies like MicroStrategy have dominated headlines with their aggressive accumulation of digital assets. Now, a powerful new contender has emerged, poised to redefine the landscape of corporate Bitcoin holdings . Get ready to dive into the exciting revelation from Twenty One Capital, a firm backed by some of the biggest names in finance and technology, as they unveil their substantial stake in the world‚Äôs leading cryptocurrency. Unveiling Twenty One Capital: A New Giant in Corporate Bitcoin Holdings The cryptocurrency community is buzzing with the official launch of Twenty One Capital‚Äôs website, which came with an astounding disclosure: the firm now holds a staggering 43,514 BTC. This isn‚Äôt just another small player; Twenty One Capital is a joint venture bringing together the formidable strengths of Tether, Bitfinex, Cantor Fitzgerald, and SoftBank. This powerhouse combination signals a profound level of institutional confidence in Bitcoin, setting a new benchmark for strategic Bitcoin holdings . To put Twenty One Capital‚Äôs acquisition into perspective, let‚Äôs compare their Bitcoin holdings with other prominent corporate players: Corporate Holder Approximate BTC Holdings Notable Backers/Context MicroStrategy 628,791 BTC Pioneering corporate Bitcoin strategy, led by Michael Saylor MARA Holdings (Marathon Digital) 49,951 BTC Leading Bitcoin mining company, accumulating BTC from operations Twenty One Capital 43,514 BTC Joint venture backed by Tether, Bitfinex, Cantor Fitzgerald, SoftBank Based on outstanding shares and public disclosures, Twenty One Capital immediately ranks as the third-largest corporate holder of BTC. This places them in an elite club, demonstrating a clear long-term commitment to the digital asset. Their significant Bitcoin holdings are not merely a speculative bet but rather a strategic investment that could influence market dynamics for years to come. Why Are These Substantial Bitcoin Holdings So Significant? The announcement of Twenty One Capital‚Äôs impressive Bitcoin holdings resonates deeply within the financial world for several compelling reasons: Institutional Validation: When entities like Twenty One Capital, backed by established financial and tech giants, publicly commit to such substantial Bitcoin holdings , it sends an undeniable signal of legitimacy. This move chips away at the lingering skepticism often associated with cryptocurrencies, painting Bitcoin not merely as a speculative asset, but as a viable, long-term store of value and a strategic treasury reserve asset. It acts as a powerful endorsement, encouraging other corporations and institutional investors who might have been on the fence to reconsider their stance on digital assets. Market Maturity: The entry of such a well-capitalized and diversified firm into the top tier of corporate Bitcoin holdings indicates a maturation of the cryptocurrency market. It suggests that Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed through a traditional investment lens, where fundamental value, scarcity, and long-term growth potential are key drivers, rather than just short-term price fluctuations. Supply Dynamics: With more and more Bitcoin being locked up in long-term corporate and institutional Bitcoin holdings , the available supply for trading on exchanges can decrease. This reduction in liquid supply, combined with consistent demand, could exert upward pressure on Bitcoin‚Äôs price over time, especially as its scarcity becomes more pronounced. Bridge to Traditional Finance: The involvement of firms like Cantor Fitzgerald (a prominent financial services firm) and SoftBank (a global technology investment giant) in Twenty One Capital‚Äôs venture creates a stronger bridge between the traditional financial world and the burgeoning digital asset space. Their participation can pave the way for more mainstream adoption and integration of Bitcoin into established investment portfolios. The Power Players Behind the 43,514 BTC: A Look at Twenty One Capital‚Äôs Backers Understanding the collective strength behind Twenty One Capital‚Äôs formidable Bitcoin holdings is crucial. Each partner brings unique expertise and influence to the table, creating a robust foundation for this new venture: Tether: As the issuer of USDT, the largest stablecoin by market capitalization, Tether plays a pivotal role in the crypto ecosystem. Its involvement brings deep liquidity knowledge, extensive market insights, and a proven track record in digital asset operations. Tether‚Äôs backing adds a layer of confidence regarding the operational efficiency and strategic management of such significant Bitcoin holdings . Bitfinex: A veteran cryptocurrency exchange, Bitfinex provides the technical infrastructure, trading expertise, and direct access to global crypto markets. Their experience in managing large-scale digital asset transactions and security protocols is invaluable for safeguarding Twenty One Capital‚Äôs substantial Bitcoin holdings . Cantor Fitzgerald: This renowned global financial services firm brings decades of experience in traditional capital markets, institutional trading, and asset management. Their participation signals a significant endorsement from the mainstream finance world, potentially opening doors for further institutional engagement and sophisticated financial strategies around these Bitcoin holdings . SoftBank: The Japanese multinational conglomerate holding company is famous for its Vision Fund, which invests heavily in technology and disruptive innovation. SoftBank‚Äôs involvement underscores a belief in Bitcoin as a transformative technology and a long-term asset, aligning the firm‚Äôs strategic vision with the future of digital finance and large-scale Bitcoin holdings . The synergy among these diverse entities positions Twenty One Capital not just as a holder, but as a potentially influential force in shaping the narrative and trajectory of institutional Bitcoin holdings . Navigating the Waters: Potential Impacts and Challenges for Massive Bitcoin Holdings While the emergence of Twenty One Capital is largely seen as a positive development, holding such substantial Bitcoin holdings comes with both immense opportunities and inherent challenges. Opportunities: Enhanced Market Stability: Large, long-term institutional Bitcoin holdings can contribute to market stability by reducing the overall volatility often associated with retail trading. These entities are less likely to engage in short-term speculative selling, providing a more stable demand base. Driving Innovation: With significant capital committed to Bitcoin, Twenty One Capital and its backers may be incentivized to invest in infrastructure, security solutions, and new financial products that leverage their Bitcoin holdings , benefiting the entire ecosystem. Regulatory Clarity: The presence of established players often necessitates clearer regulatory frameworks. Their lobbying power and adherence to compliance can help push for more favorable and predictable regulations, which is beneficial for all participants in the crypto space. Challenges: Volatility Risk: Despite the long-term outlook, Bitcoin remains a volatile asset. Fluctuations in its value can significantly impact the balance sheets of companies with large Bitcoin holdings , potentially affecting their financial reporting and investor confidence. Security Concerns: Managing and securing 43,514 BTC requires top-tier cybersecurity measures. Any breach could lead to catastrophic losses, making robust cold storage and multi-signature solutions paramount. Regulatory Scrutiny: While they can push for clarity, large institutional Bitcoin holdings also attract increased scrutiny from regulators concerned about market manipulation, anti-money laundering (AML), and know-your-customer (KYC) compliance. Public Perception: The association with firms like Tether (which has faced past regulatory challenges) could lead to public relations hurdles, requiring transparent communication regarding their Bitcoin holdings and operational practices. What Does This Mean for the Future of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings and the Crypto Market? Twenty One Capital‚Äôs significant entry is more than just a headline; it‚Äôs a harbinger of things to come. This move is likely to inspire other large corporations and institutional investors who have been cautiously observing the crypto market from the sidelines. The validation provided by such a diverse and influential group of backers could trigger a domino effect, leading to a broader trend of corporate Bitcoin holdings becoming a standard part of treasury management and investment portfolios. For the broader crypto market, this signals continued maturation and integration into the global financial system. Bitcoin‚Äôs journey from a niche digital currency to a globally recognized asset class is accelerating, driven by the increasing confidence of major financial players. We can expect to see: Increased institutional liquidity. More sophisticated financial products built around Bitcoin. A continued focus on regulatory compliance and transparency. Potentially, a reduction in extreme price swings as more long-term capital enters the market. For individual investors and enthusiasts, this development reinforces the long-term investment thesis for Bitcoin. It underscores the idea that Bitcoin is not just a passing fad but a fundamental shift in how value is stored and transferred in the digital age. Keeping an eye on these large institutional moves provides valuable insight into the macro trends shaping the future of digital assets. Conclusion The emergence of Twenty One Capital as a major player in corporate Bitcoin holdings marks a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency market. With 43,514 BTC under its belt and the formidable backing of Tether, Bitfinex, Cantor Fitzgerald, and SoftBank, this joint venture is not just accumulating assets; it‚Äôs signaling a profound belief in Bitcoin‚Äôs enduring value and its role in the future of finance. This strategic move reinforces Bitcoin‚Äôs legitimacy, paves the way for further institutional adoption, and sets a new standard for corporate engagement with digital assets. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, Twenty One Capital‚Äôs substantial Bitcoin holdings will undoubtedly be a key factor to watch, shaping market dynamics and inspiring new investment paradigms for years to come.

2025-07-30T05:00:08,"Solana Prediction: Will ETF Approval Push the Price to a New Record High?","The crypto market is heating up as investors begin positioning ahead of what could be the biggest ETF wave yet. With Bitcoin and Ethereum already receiving spot ETF approvals and seeing massive institutional inflows, speculation is now swirling around which altcoin might be next. For many analysts, that frontrunner could beSolana ‚Äì thanks to its lightning-fast transactions, growing developer base, and strong network effect. Solana‚Äôs current price hovers just under $186, and while some short-term pullbacks have occurred, the broader trend still points upward. If it secures an ETF in the coming months, history suggests we could see a rapid price breakout‚Äîsimilar to Bitcoin‚Äôs run past $70K or Ethereum‚Äôs rally after its own approval. Amid this growing institutional interest, investors are also exploring early-stage altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which some believe could offer even greater upside due to its current presale status. Solana‚Äôs Setup for a Breakout Technically, Solana is forming a solid base after cooling off from its June highs. Its all-time high remains at $293, and momentum indicators show the coin could be gearing up for a retest if a positive ETF headline hits. The recent RSI dip into oversold territory may be the kind of reset needed before a renewed push. In many ways, Solana is now where Ethereum was just weeks before its own ETF triggered a wave of new capital. Traders are watching the $190‚Äì$200 zone closely. A breakout above that could open the path to $220 and then $293. Beyond price action, ETF approval would bring legitimacy and long-term capital, potentially reshaping Solana‚Äôs role in the broader crypto landscape. A Rare Opportunity for Crypto Investors While Solana garners attention from institutions, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a high-conviction pick for retail investors looking to strike early. The project is currently in presale, and slots are disappearing fast. What‚Äôs driving this surge? Analysts point to MAGACOIN‚Äôs aggressive development pace and viral community growth. With projections as high as 31x ROI, a $1,000 investment today could skyrocket to $31,000 by the next major cycle, according to early forecasts. The project has already hit several key milestones, including rapid user onboarding and ecosystem rollout. Could Solana Reach $293 Again? That depends largely on one thing: the ETF. If Solana receives regulatory approval in the U.S., institutional demand could skyrocket‚Äîjust as it did for BTC and ETH. With fundamentals aligned and sentiment shifting, the next few weeks could be critical. And while Solana chases ETF-driven momentum, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are quietly giving early investors a shot at major gains , even before they hit centralized exchanges.
