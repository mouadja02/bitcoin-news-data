2025-07-30T12:57:39,"Trump Pressures Powell to Cut Rates Again as US Economy Outperforms in Q2","The GPD report for the second quarter of the year in the United States is out and paints a more promising picture, registering an annualized rate of 3% in this period compared to last year’s. Immediately after the news went out, US President Donald Trump reiterated his stance that the Federal Reserve needs to lower the interest rates as soon as today. Perhaps in an attempt to prepare for Trump’s tariffs against multiple key partners, businesses piled up in Q1 this year, which resulted in less economic expansion. The difference in Q2 is quite evident, given the aforementioned 3% increase, as many of those entities scaled back on imports. According to CNN, most experts anticipated a more modest 2% growth. Consequently, the gross domestic product’s (GDP) rise in Q2 of 3% helps Trump’s agenda to push for an interest rate cut after the -0.5% correction observed in the first quarter of 2025, which was the first decline in three years. TRUMP: 2Q GDP JUST OUT, WAY BETTER THAN EXPECTED — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) July 30, 2025 The POTUS was quick to praise the development, and used it as an opportunity to pressure Fed Chair Jerome Powell to cut the rates as he has done multiple times in the past. In fact, in one of those reiterations, Trump urged the most significant rate cut in the history of 3 basis points. BTC’s price follows the macro developments in the world’s largest economy, and its movements are tightly correlated to the nation’s interest rate policy. Still being considered a riskier asset, it tends to benefit from an environment with lower rates. This hasn’t stopped it from thriving for the past year or so. However, it has stalled below the most recent all-time high of over $123,000, charted a couple of weeks ago, and many experts believe a potential rate cut could lead to further gains. However, the chances of this happening later today during the FOMC meeting are very slim.

2025-07-30T12:45:11,"US-India Tariffs: Trump’s Bold Move to Impose 25% on Indian Imports and Its Global Ripple Effect","BitcoinWorld US-India Tariffs: Trump’s Bold Move to Impose 25% on Indian Imports and Its Global Ripple Effect In the intricate dance of global economics, even a whisper of trade policy changes can send ripples across markets. For those closely watching the ebb and flow of traditional finance and the burgeoning cryptocurrency space, understanding these shifts is paramount. A recent announcement, initially shared by Walter Bloomberg on X, indicates that former U.S. President Donald Trump plans to impose a significant 25% tariff on goods imported from India if he returns to office. This potential move concerning US-India tariffs isn’t just a headline; it’s a potential game-changer that could redefine trade relations, impact global supply chains, and even subtly influence the volatility and appeal of digital assets. What Exactly Are These Proposed US-India Tariffs and Why Now? At its core, a tariff is a tax imposed by one country on goods and services imported from another country. They are typically used to protect domestic industries, generate revenue, or exert political pressure. The proposed US-India tariffs , specifically a 25% levy on Indian imports, would significantly increase the cost of Indian goods entering the U.S. market. While the announcement comes from a potential future administration, it echoes a consistent theme from Donald Trump’s previous presidency: a strong belief in using tariffs as a tool to address perceived trade imbalances and encourage domestic production. During his first term, the U.S. implemented tariffs on various goods from China and other nations, aiming to renegotiate trade agreements that he deemed unfair to American workers and businesses. This latest proposal targeting India aligns with that protectionist philosophy. The 25% figure is substantial. For context, even small tariff increases can significantly alter the competitiveness of imported goods. A quarter of the import value added as a tax could make many Indian products prohibitively expensive for American consumers and businesses, potentially forcing them to seek alternatives or absorb higher costs. This move is less about generating revenue and more about strategic leverage, signaling a potential shift in the economic relationship between two of the world’s largest democracies. How Will These US-India Tariffs Reshape Global Supply Chains? The immediate and most tangible impact of such substantial US-India tariffs would be felt across various sectors and supply chains. India is a significant exporter of diverse goods to the U.S., including: Pharmaceuticals: India is a major global supplier of generic drugs. Higher tariffs could increase drug prices for American consumers. Textiles and Apparel: Indian textiles are competitive in the U.S. market. A 25% tariff would make them considerably more expensive, potentially benefiting other textile-producing nations or domestic U.S. manufacturers. Information Technology Services: While less about physical goods, trade policies can influence the flow of services and talent. Gems and Jewelry: India is a hub for diamond polishing and jewelry manufacturing. Agricultural Products: Certain Indian agricultural exports could face hurdles. For Indian exporters, a 25% tariff would mean a drastic reduction in their competitiveness in the U.S. market. They would either have to absorb the cost, reduce their profit margins, or find alternative markets. This could lead to job losses in India and a slowdown in its export-driven growth. On the U.S. side, importers and consumers would face higher prices for goods that previously came from India. While the stated goal is to boost domestic production, the transition isn’t seamless. Businesses would need to find new suppliers, either domestically or from other countries, which can be costly and time-consuming. This could lead to: Increased Consumer Prices: Higher import costs are often passed on to consumers. Supply Chain Disruptions: Companies relying on Indian components or finished goods would need to reconfigure their sourcing. Reduced Product Variety: If certain Indian goods become too expensive, they might disappear from U.S. shelves. Ultimately, these tariffs could force a significant reconfiguration of global supply chains, pushing companies to diversify their sourcing away from India or to bring production back to the U.S., a process known as ‘reshoring’ or ‘nearshoring’. Are US-India Tariffs a Threat or an Opportunity for the Global Economy? The imposition of significant US-India tariffs presents a complex scenario with both challenges and potential, albeit limited, opportunities. Challenges: Aspect Impact Inflationary Pressures Increased costs for imported goods can lead to higher prices for consumers in the U.S. Reduced Economic Growth Trade barriers can stifle global trade, leading to slower economic expansion for both nations and potentially globally. Retaliatory Measures India might impose its own tariffs on U.S. goods, escalating into a full-blown trade war. Geopolitical Tensions Economic disputes can strain diplomatic relations between key global players. Supply Chain Vulnerability Forcing companies to rapidly shift sourcing can create new bottlenecks and inefficiencies. Potential Opportunities (often debated and with caveats): Boost to Domestic Industries: U.S. manufacturers in affected sectors might see increased demand for their products. Diversification for India: India might be compelled to seek new trade partners and diversify its export markets, reducing reliance on any single country. Strategic Reshoring: Companies might invest more in U.S. manufacturing, potentially creating jobs, though at a higher cost. Historically, broad tariff impositions have often led to a net negative outcome for global trade and economic stability. While some domestic industries might see a short-term benefit, the broader economy typically grapples with higher costs, reduced consumer choice, and potential retaliatory actions from affected nations. Beyond Trade: How Could US-India Tariffs Influence Broader Markets, Including Crypto? The ripple effect of significant trade policy changes like the proposed US-India tariffs extends far beyond just the immediate goods and services involved. Global markets are interconnected, and economic uncertainty in one area can spill over into others, including the burgeoning world of cryptocurrencies. When traditional trade relations become strained, it often leads to increased volatility in conventional financial markets. Stock markets might react negatively to concerns about corporate profits and economic growth. Currency markets could see shifts as investors move capital in response to perceived risks or opportunities. In times of such uncertainty, investors often seek out assets perceived as ‘safe havens’ or alternatives to traditional investments. This is where cryptocurrencies, particularly decentralized assets like Bitcoin, enter the conversation. While highly volatile themselves, Bitcoin and other digital assets have, at times, demonstrated a low correlation with traditional markets, making them attractive to some investors looking to hedge against geopolitical and economic instability. If US-India tariffs escalate into a broader trade dispute or contribute to global economic slowdown, we might observe: Increased Demand for Digital Gold: Bitcoin is often referred to as ‘digital gold’ due to its finite supply and decentralized nature. In times of economic uncertainty, some investors might flock to Bitcoin as a store of value, similar to how they would traditional gold. Diversification of Portfolios: As traditional investment strategies face headwinds from trade wars and inflation, more investors might consider allocating a portion of their portfolios to cryptocurrencies for diversification. Innovation in Cross-Border Payments: Tariffs can complicate traditional banking and payment systems for international trade. This could indirectly accelerate the exploration and adoption of blockchain-based solutions for faster, cheaper, and more transparent cross-border transactions, circumventing some traditional friction points. While the direct link isn’t always immediate or straightforward, a climate of escalating trade tensions and economic uncertainty can certainly contribute to a narrative that favors decentralized, borderless assets like cryptocurrencies, as they offer an alternative paradigm to traditional, government-controlled financial systems. Actionable Insights for Businesses and Investors In anticipation of potential shifts in trade policy, proactive measures are crucial: For Businesses: Diversify your supply chains. Don’t rely too heavily on a single country or region for critical inputs. Explore options for domestic sourcing or from other trade-friendly nations. For Importers/Exporters: Stay informed about trade negotiations and potential tariff lists. Engage with trade associations and legal experts to understand the implications for your specific products. For Investors: Monitor geopolitical developments and their potential impact on market sentiment. Consider a diversified investment portfolio that includes a thoughtful allocation to alternative assets like cryptocurrencies, understanding their inherent risks and potential for volatility. For Consumers: Be prepared for potential price increases on imported goods. Supporting local businesses can also be a way to mitigate some impacts of international trade shifts. A Shifting Landscape: The Enduring Impact of Trade Policy The prospect of significant US-India tariffs underscores the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of international trade. While the immediate focus is on the economic implications for two major global players, the ripple effect could extend to global supply chains, consumer prices, and even the broader financial ecosystem, including the evolving cryptocurrency markets. As we move forward, adaptability, informed decision-making, and a keen eye on geopolitical developments will be essential for businesses, investors, and individuals alike to navigate this potentially challenging, yet transformative, economic landscape. The narrative of protectionism versus free trade continues to shape our world, and understanding its nuances is key to thriving in an interconnected global economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is a tariff, and why are they imposed? A1: A tariff is a tax imposed by a government on goods and services imported from another country. They are typically imposed to protect domestic industries from foreign competition, generate revenue for the government, or as a bargaining chip in international trade negotiations to achieve specific economic or political goals. Q2: Which Indian goods would be most affected by a 25% US tariff? A2: While a comprehensive list would depend on specific policy details, historically, key Indian exports to the U.S. that could be significantly impacted include pharmaceuticals (especially generic drugs), textiles and apparel, gems and jewelry, certain agricultural products, and potentially components for the IT and automotive sectors. Q3: How might these proposed US-India tariffs impact the average American consumer? A3: The average American consumer could face higher prices for goods imported from India, such as certain medications, clothing, and electronics. This is because the additional cost from the tariff is often passed on from importers to retailers and, ultimately, to the consumer. It could also lead to reduced availability or variety of certain products. Q4: Could these tariffs lead to a trade war between the US and India? A4: There is a significant risk. If the U.S. imposes substantial tariffs, India might retaliate with its own tariffs on American goods. This escalation, known as a trade war, can harm economies on both sides by reducing trade volumes, increasing costs, and creating economic uncertainty. Q5: What is the potential link between trade tariffs and cryptocurrency markets? A5: While not a direct cause-and-effect, trade tariffs and the economic uncertainty they create can indirectly influence cryptocurrency markets. When traditional financial markets (stocks, bonds, fiat currencies) experience volatility or instability due to trade disputes, some investors may seek alternative assets. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are sometimes viewed as ‘digital gold’ or a hedge against traditional market turmoil, potentially increasing their appeal during such periods. Q6: How can businesses prepare for such trade policy changes? A6: Businesses can prepare by diversifying their supply chains to reduce reliance on single countries, exploring domestic sourcing options, closely monitoring trade policy developments, and consulting with trade experts. Understanding the potential impact on costs, logistics, and market demand is crucial for strategic planning. If you found this article insightful, please consider sharing it with your network!

2025-07-30T12:35:21,"Federal Reserve Should Impose Tariff Inflation Exclusion, Cut Rates in July – Mulhem","The Federal Reserve has found itself under growing pressure from US President Donald Trump amid its reluctance to lower the federal funds rate due to concerns over the inflationary effects of tariffs. Last week, Trump visited the Fed and questioned Chairman Jerome Powell about over-budget renovations, while also reiterating calls for the FOMC to cut rates. A rate cut would directly benefit Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, in addition to other risk-on assets, such as equities, while also stimulating US economic activity. However, the market believes the Fed holding rates steady at the FOMC meeting on 30 July is near-certain, with there being just a 3.1% chance of a rate cut as per CME FedWatch and Polymarket giving similarly low odds for a July rate cut . Despite the market’s expectations, Suliman Mulhem, a financial analyst, believes a surprise 25bps cut this week is not completely off the table. “A surprise 25bps cut could be on the cards on 30 July if the Fed decides to accept tariff-induced price hikes as transitory, one-off increases,” Mulhem said. “As the US labour market is not especially tight at the moment and not a material source of inflationary pressure, tariffs are extremely unlikely to induce a wage-price spiral, so their effects are likely to be limited to a one-time price increase rather than recurring price creep.” Mulhem added that the low risk of a wage-price spiral and the fact that companies have low pricing power means the Fed should lower the federal funds rate this week. “The absence of a wage-price spiral, coupled with firms currently having relatively low pricing power and therefore opting to work the majority of the tariffs into their margin rather than hiking prices for consumers, means it would be prudent for the FOMC to make monetary policy decisions with an exclusion on tariff-related inflation and therefore begin cutting the federal funds rate in July.” He also warned that although headline jobs data looks encouraging, some cracks are already beginning to show beneath the surface. “As for the other side of the Fed’s dual mandate, although the unemployment rate has remained close to four percent and the labour market looks robust, non-healthcare private sector job creation has slowed to virtually zero and further cracks could soon begin to show, potentially prompting a jumbo 50bps cut at the September FOMC meeting if the Fed opts to keep rates unchanged on Wednesday.” Bitcoin has been trading in the $116,000-$120,000 range in recent weeks, as the market awaits a new catalyst for a directional breakout. A surprise cut on 30 July could provide Bitcoin with fresh momentum to decisively break above $120,000 and enter a new phase of price discovery.

2025-07-30T12:35:12,"BTC Capital Rotation or Fresh Fund Inflows: What’s Really Fueling ETH’s Rally?","The consensus in the crypto market is that the ongoing ether (ETH) rally, which has extended to other altcoins, is driven by capital rotation from bitcoin (BTC). However, on-chain data obtained by CryptoQuant has proven that the information is false. According to a report by CQ’s analyst Carmelo Aleman, fresh inflow from investors is driving the ETH rally, not capital rotation from bitcoin. Market participants are not selling BTC to buy ETH – the Bitcoin Realized Capitalization serves as evidence for this claim. What is Driving Ether’s Rally? This month, ETH has climbed over 60% from $2,400 to $3,850. On the other hand, BTC has increased by 14% from $107,000 to hit an all-time high (ATH) above $123,000. Although BTC declined briefly to the $115,000 zone, it has consolidated mostly between $117,000 and $120,000. As of July 25, bitcoin reached a new ATH in Realized Cap at $1.018 trillion. This metric represents the market cap of bitcoin by telling the price at which each BTC was last moved on-chain. Hence, it reflects the total acquisition cost of all BTC in circulation, factoring in accumulation trends and large-scale selling. The increase in Realized Cap indicates that the capital invested in bitcoin is rising, not declining. So, instead of dumping BTC for ETH and other altcoins, investors are allocating fresh capital to their other crypto holdings. No Major Capital Rotation Addressing bitcoin’s consolidation concerns, Aleman explained that such price pauses can be attributed to capital accumulation phases that come before exponential rallies. The market has witnessed such dynamics in past bull cycles; this time will be no different. “So, what’s happening with ETH? The answer is simple: following the Genesis Law, along with the strong growth prospects of the Ethereum ecosystem, there has been a surge in capital invested in ETH this July, but without reducing positions in BTC,” the analyst added. In conclusion, there is no major capital rotation from BTC to ETH. Investors are just injecting new capital through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and other investment products. Institutional demand for ETH is currently at peak levels, with spot Ethereum ETF purchases accounting for more than the daily production of ether. Ethereum investment products just recorded their second-largest weekly inflow at $1.59 billion. Inflows into the products this year have exceeded the total recorded in all of 2023.

2025-07-30T12:30:44,"Ethereum Price Could Rise To $9,000 This Cycle, Eyes Breakout Against Bitcoin","Crypto analyst Lourenço has predicted that the Ethereum price could rally to $9,000 in this market cycle. This comes as ETH eyes a breakout against its BTC pair, which could spark a massive run for the crypto and other altcoins. Ethereum Price Eyes Rally To $9,000 This Cycle In an X post, Lourenço opined that the Ethereum price could rally to as high as $9,000 at some point in this market cycle. This came as he analyzed the weekly ETH chart. The analyst noted that, depending on how the trend on the upper side of the wedge is drawn, the altcoin may have already broken it with hard closes above. Related Reading: Ethereum Price To $20,000? ETH Is Mirroring Bitcoin’s Move From 2021 Lourenço declared that the $4,000 level is an important one and that once it flips into support, there will be additional resistance between $4,700 and $5,000. However, the analyst believes that the Ethereum price is ultimately set to go and tag between $8,000 and $9,000. He also indicated that the risk-return ratio on ETH is very hard to ignore at the moment. Crypto analyst Galaxy also echoed a similar bullish sentiment for the Ethereum price. In an X post, he said that there is a lot of potential upside for ETH on the BTC pair. The analyst noted that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is still bottomed and that, from his perspective, the trend is just beginning. His accompanying chart showed that the RSI isn’t in overbought levels despite the fact that the Ethereum price has rallied over 60% in the past month. Notably, ETH’s RSI had surged above 60 on previous highs, including when it reached its current ATH of $4,800 in 2021. The Key Is For ETH To Break Above $4,000 In an X post, crypto analyst Ted revealed that the key is for the Ethereum price to break above the $4,000 level. He noted that since the 2021 ATH, ETH hasn’t been able to reclaim the $4,000 level. However, if that happens this time around, he declared that the ETH pump will be “unstoppable.” Related Reading: Crypto Founder Reveals What Will Drive Ethereum Price To $10,000 His accompanying chart showed that the Ethereum price could rally to $5,200 in the short term. This will mark a new all-time high for the altcoin. Crypto analyst Merlijn also hammered on the $4,000 resistance. He noted that this has been the ceiling for ETH since 2021, and it has been rejected from this level seven times. However, the Ethereum price is again looking to break above this level. Merlijn remarked that this resistance isn’t just another resistance but the “gate to price discovery.” His accompanying chart showed that ETH could reach $11,000 between now and 2026 if it breaks this resistance level. At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $3,800, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

2025-07-30T12:30:22,"Kraken releases latest Proof of Reserves, continuing our commitment to trust through transparency","At Kraken, transparency isn’t a slogan – it’s a standard. Our latest Proof of Reserves (PoR) audit , finalized as of June 30, 2025 , once again verifies that client assets held on our platform are backed 1:1 and beyond. The process covers major cryptoassets, including BTC, ETH, SOL, USDC, USDT, XRP and ADA . We don’t expect blind trust. We don’t need it. We offer cryptographic evidence. New to PoR? Learn how it works in our beginner’s guide . What our June 2025 report shows Our PoR audit captures a complete snapshot of client assets across all services – not just spot balances. It includes margin accounts, futures holdings and staked assets , offering a full-spectrum look at customer exposure. Reserve ratios as of June 30, 2025 A quick refresher – what is Proof of Reserves? Proof of Reserves is a cryptographic process that allows clients to verify, independently and privately, that their assets are included in a third-party-audited snapshot of the platform’s liabilities. We use a Merkle tree to combine individual balances into a single cryptographic hash. Clients receive a personalized Merkle proof , which they can use to confirm inclusion without revealing personal details. An independent auditor then confirms that Kraken’s onchain holdings exceed total client balances – effectively verifying full reserves without assumptions. Why Kraken’s PoR goes further While more exchanges are now offering “PoRs” in some form, not all of them offer the same level of rigor or transparency. Here’s what sets ours apart: 1. We account for liabilities, not just assets Some platforms show what they hold – but skip what they owe. We include total client liabilities in every audit. Anything less isn’t a full proof of reserves. 2. User-level verification Every client can verify their own inclusion using our open-source Merkle verification tool. This isn’t just about trust – it’s about verification. 3. A decade of consistency We first pioneered PoR in 2014 – and we haven’t stopped. Kraken conducts PoR regularly and methodically , not just during news cycles. PoR is vital. It’s not about promises. It’s about proof – visible, cryptographic, third-party-verified proof. Kraken’s process is built to withstand scrutiny and empower users with information. What’s next – expanding scope We’re committed to publishing PoRs quarterly , alongside our financial disclosures, to ensure users have a regular window into platform solvency. We’re also actively working to expand the coverage of our PoRs to include more supported assets , giving a broader view of the reserves across our ecosystem. Since the beginning, Kraken has stood for accountability, independence and crypto-first values . We believe transparency should be an industry norm, not an afterthought. That’s why we’ll keep raising the bar. Ready to verify your account? Visit our Proof of Reserves portal .

2025-07-30T12:10:15,"Trump Tariff Deadline: A Crucial Economic Warning for Crypto Investors","BitcoinWorld Trump Tariff Deadline: A Crucial Economic Warning for Crypto Investors The digital asset world often finds itself intertwined with global economic and political currents. A recent declaration from U.S. President Donald Trump has sent ripples through financial markets, and it’s crucial for cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors to understand its potential implications. In a direct post on Truth Social, relayed by Walter Bloomberg on X, President Trump unequivocally stated that the August 1 deadline for ongoing trade negotiations ‘stands strong’ and will not be extended. He even characterized this firm stance as ‘a great day for America.’ But what does this decisive Trump Tariff Deadline mean for the broader economic landscape, and more specifically, for the often-unpredictable crypto market? Understanding the Trump Tariff Deadline Announcement President Trump’s latest announcement regarding the August 1 Trump Tariff Deadline underscores his consistent ‘America First’ approach to trade policy. Historically, Trump’s administration has favored aggressive negotiation tactics, often employing tariffs as leverage to secure what he deems more favorable trade agreements. This particular deadline, though not explicitly detailing the specific negotiations it pertains to, signals a firm resolve to conclude or escalate ongoing trade discussions. Source of the News: The declaration was made by President Trump himself in a post on Truth Social, subsequently reported by Walter Bloomberg on X, a well-known source for rapid financial news updates. This direct communication method bypasses traditional media filters, giving the announcement immediate weight and authenticity from the President’s perspective. The Core Message: The unambiguous statement that the August 1st deadline ‘stands strong’ and ‘will not be extended’ leaves no room for speculation. It indicates a clear intention to push for a swift resolution or to proceed with consequences if demands are not met. President’s Stance: Labeling the decision as ‘a great day for America’ suggests a belief that this firm stance will ultimately benefit U.S. economic interests, potentially by securing better trade deals or protecting domestic industries. This sentiment often resonates with his political base and aligns with his broader economic philosophy. Immediate Implication: For businesses and markets, this means a period of heightened anticipation leading up to August 1st. Companies involved in international trade, particularly those with exposure to potential tariffs, will be scrambling to assess risks and adjust strategies. Historical Context: Past Trump Tariff Deadlines and Market Reactions To truly grasp the potential impact of this new Trump Tariff Deadline , it’s beneficial to look back at previous instances of President Trump’s trade-related pronouncements and their market reverberations. During his previous term, the U.S. engaged in significant trade disputes, most notably with China, but also with allies like the European Union and Canada over steel and aluminum tariffs. These periods were often characterized by a high degree of market uncertainty and volatility, as businesses and investors grappled with unpredictable policy shifts. Consider the U.S.-China trade war, which spanned several years. The imposition of tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods, from agricultural products to electronics, created immense pressure on global supply chains and corporate profitability. Each announcement, each deadline, and each negotiation round triggered significant reactions in stock markets, commodity prices, and currency valuations. While the cryptocurrency market was less mature during the peak of these trade wars, it did show interesting patterns. Bitcoin, in particular, sometimes saw spikes in demand as it was perceived by some as an uncorrelated asset or a ‘digital gold’ hedge against traditional financial instability. However, as the crypto market has matured and become more integrated with traditional finance, its correlation with equities has generally increased, meaning major downturns in traditional markets are more likely to drag crypto prices down. Potential Economic Ripple Effects of the Trump Tariff Deadline A hard deadline for trade negotiations, particularly one related to tariffs, carries significant weight for the global economy. If agreements aren’t reached by the August 1 Trump Tariff Deadline , several economic ripple effects could ensue, impacting various sectors and potentially leading to broader macroeconomic shifts: Supply Chain Disruptions: New or increased tariffs could force multinational corporations to urgently re-evaluate their sourcing and manufacturing locations. This often leads to costly and time-consuming reconfigurations, resulting in delays, higher logistical expenses, and potential shortages of goods. Companies might onshore production or seek new international partners, but these transitions are rarely smooth. Inflationary Pressures: Tariffs are essentially taxes on imported goods, and these costs are typically passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. For example, if tariffs are imposed on raw materials, the cost of finished goods using those materials will increase. This contributes directly to inflation, eroding purchasing power and potentially leading to a decrease in consumer spending. Reduced Corporate Earnings: Businesses facing higher input costs due to tariffs, or reduced demand because their products become more expensive, may see their profit margins shrink. This directly impacts corporate earnings, which in turn can lead to lower stock valuations, reduced investment, and even job losses in affected industries. Global Economic Slowdown: Widespread trade tensions and protectionist policies can dampen global economic growth. Uncertainty discourages both domestic and foreign investment, as businesses become hesitant to expand or commit capital in an unpredictable environment. This can lead to a contraction in international trade volumes and a general slowdown in economic activity worldwide. Currency Fluctuations: Trade imbalances and policy decisions can lead to significant shifts in currency values. For instance, if a country faces new tariffs on its exports, its currency might weaken as demand for its goods falls. Such fluctuations can further complicate international trade and investment, creating additional layers of risk for global businesses and investors. How the Trump Tariff Deadline Could Influence Crypto Markets While the immediate focus of a Trump Tariff Deadline might seem squarely on traditional financial markets, the interconnectedness of the global economy means that cryptocurrencies are rarely immune to significant macro-economic shifts. The digital asset space, though decentralized, still operates within a global financial framework that reacts to major economic news. Here’s how a firm August 1 deadline could potentially influence the crypto market: Increased Volatility: Economic uncertainty is a primary driver of volatility across all asset classes, and cryptocurrencies, already known for their price swings, could experience even greater fluctuations. Traders might react impulsively to news, leading to sharp price swings as sentiment shifts rapidly between fear and opportunity. Major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as smaller altcoins, could see exaggerated movements. Risk-Off Sentiment: In times of global economic stress or perceived instability, investors often move away from what they consider ‘riskier’ assets towards ‘safe havens.’ While Bitcoin has sometimes been hailed as ‘digital gold’ and a hedge against inflation or traditional market instability, its correlation with traditional equities has increased significantly in recent years. This means a substantial downturn in traditional stock markets, triggered by trade tensions, could drag crypto prices down as investors liquidate assets across the board to cover losses or move to cash. Search for Alternatives and Digital Gold Narrative: Conversely, if traditional financial systems show significant signs of strain, or if fiat currencies experience substantial devaluation due to trade wars and inflation, some investors might increasingly turn to cryptocurrencies as an alternative store of value or a hedge against traditional economic instability. This could potentially drive renewed demand for assets like Bitcoin, reinforcing its ‘digital gold’ narrative, especially if the crisis is perceived to undermine the stability of national currencies. Impact on Adoption and Innovation: Prolonged economic uncertainty could either accelerate or decelerate crypto adoption, depending on how the technology is perceived amidst the turmoil. If cryptocurrencies, particularly stablecoins and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, offer practical solutions to cross-border payments, remittances, or provide inflation-resistant alternatives, their adoption might grow. However, if the market is seen as too volatile and speculative, mainstream adoption might slow down as cautious investors shy away. Liquidity Shifts: Major economic events can cause capital to flow in and out of different markets. A significant shift of funds out of traditional markets could either lead to some capital finding its way into crypto, or it could drain liquidity from crypto as investors prioritize more liquid assets for immediate needs. Navigating Market Volatility: Actionable Insights for Investors Given the potential for increased market volatility stemming from the Trump Tariff Deadline , prudent investors should consider adopting a strategic and informed approach. Emotional reactions to market news can often lead to poor decisions. Here are some actionable insights to help navigate these uncertain times: Stay Informed and Verify Sources: Keep a close eye on geopolitical developments, economic indicators, and official announcements from credible news sources. Be wary of unverified rumors and always cross-reference information. Understanding the nuances of trade policy and its potential impacts is paramount. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your digital eggs in one basket. A diversified crypto portfolio, including a mix of established large-cap cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin and Ethereum), stablecoins, and perhaps some carefully researched altcoins, can help mitigate risks associated with single asset price swings. Consider also diversifying across different sectors within crypto, such as DeFi, NFTs, or Layer 1 solutions. Implement Robust Risk Management: Define your personal risk tolerance and stick to it. Avoid over-leveraging in speculative trades, as sudden market movements can lead to rapid liquidations. Consider setting stop-loss orders to automatically limit potential losses during sharp downturns, and only invest what you can afford to lose. Maintain a Long-Term Perspective: For many, cryptocurrency investing is a long-term game, focusing on the underlying technology and its potential for future adoption. Short-term market fluctuations, while unsettling, may not significantly impact a well-researched long-term strategy. Avoid emotional trading driven by daily news cycles and focus on your long-term investment goals. Utilize Stablecoins Strategically: During periods of high volatility and uncertainty, parking a portion of your funds in stablecoins (cryptocurrencies pegged to fiat currencies like USD) can offer a temporary refuge from market swings. This allows you to preserve capital while waiting for clearer market signals or opportunities. Practice Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of making large lump-sum investments, consider investing a fixed amount regularly (e.g., weekly or monthly), regardless of the asset’s price. This strategy can help smooth out the impact of volatility over time, reducing the risk of buying at a market peak. Conduct Thorough Research (DYOR): Before making any investment decisions, thoroughly research the projects you are considering. Understand their fundamentals, use cases, team, and community. Informed decisions are always better than speculative gambles. President Trump’s firm declaration on the August 1 Trump Tariff Deadline introduces a significant variable into the global economic equation. While the immediate focus remains on international trade, the ripple effects are likely to extend into every corner of the financial world, including the dynamic and often sensitive cryptocurrency markets. Investors should prepare for potential increased volatility and remain vigilant, adapting their strategies to navigate the evolving landscape. Understanding these macro-economic shifts is not just about anticipating price movements; it’s about making informed decisions in an increasingly interconnected global economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the significance of the August 1 Trump Tariff Deadline? A1: The August 1 deadline signifies President Trump’s firm stance that ongoing trade negotiations will not be extended. This indicates a potential escalation of trade tensions or the finalization of agreements, which can have significant global economic consequences, including impacts on supply chains, inflation, and market stability. Q2: How have past trade disputes under Trump impacted financial markets? A2: Past trade disputes, particularly the U.S.-China trade war, led to considerable market uncertainty and volatility. Stock markets experienced fluctuations, global supply chains were disrupted, and there were shifts in demand for various assets. While crypto markets were less mature then, they also showed reactions, with Bitcoin sometimes acting as a perceived hedge. Q3: Why should cryptocurrency investors pay attention to trade policy announcements? A3: Global economic policies, like trade tariffs, influence overall market sentiment, investor risk appetite, and the stability of traditional financial systems. As the crypto market becomes more integrated with the broader economy, these macro-economic shifts can directly impact cryptocurrency prices, liquidity, and investor behavior. Q4: Will the Trump Tariff Deadline cause a crypto market crash? A4: While a direct ‘crash’ is not guaranteed, the Trump Tariff Deadline could contribute to increased market volatility and a potential ‘risk-off’ sentiment, which might lead to price corrections in the crypto market. The extent of the impact depends on the specific outcomes of the trade negotiations and broader market reactions. Q5: What are some strategies for crypto investors during periods of economic uncertainty? A5: Key strategies include staying informed, diversifying your portfolio, implementing robust risk management (e.g., stop-loss orders), maintaining a long-term investment perspective, strategically utilizing stablecoins, and practicing dollar-cost averaging (DCA). Always conduct your own thorough research (DYOR). Q6: Is Bitcoin considered a safe-haven asset during trade wars? A6: Bitcoin’s role as a safe-haven asset during trade wars is debated. While some argue it acts as ‘digital gold’ against fiat currency devaluation or traditional market instability, its correlation with traditional equities has increased. Its safe-haven status can depend on the specific economic conditions and investor perception at the time. If you found this analysis insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

2025-07-30T12:07:32,"Trump’s Crypto Empire: $1.2 billion in Personal Profit – 20% of His Government Advisors Hold Cryptocurrencies [Infographic]","Trump’s penchant for digital assets is no secret. However, the scale of his investments is considerable, as a new infographic from Cryptonews shows. Donald Trump’s personal crypto wealth has now already exceeded the $1.2 billion mark. According to the Democratic Caucus on the U.S. Congressional Financial Services Committee, Trump has systematically worked in recent months to weaken relevant regulatory authorities and stifle ongoing proceedings to build up crypto wealth secretly. According to a recent analysis, this wealth now even exceeds the total value of his real estate portfolio. As the infographic shows, Trump’s crypto wealth is spread across several asset classes and projects with a direct or indirect connection to his name. At the top is World Liberty Financial, a crypto company with close family ties, from which, according to research, Donald Trump is said to have siphoned around $390 million. This is followed by a $315 million meme coin, for which Trump licensed his name and profited from the price increase, as well as obfuscated wallets and investments valued at $430 million. He generated further income, among other things, from the sale of his own Trump NFTs. Trump’s attributed crypto wealth according to Forbes’ research. Source: Forbes . A central element of Trump’s crypto strategy is the aggressive positioning of his media company, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), as an institutional Bitcoin investor. As the infographic shows, the company now holds approximately $2 billion in Bitcoin and Bitcoin-related securities—including physical holdings, options, and exchange-traded products. Notably, the remaining liquid assets amount to only around $1 billion, meaning that roughly two-thirds of the total liquidity reserve is tied up in crypto assets. Percentage of BTC and bitcoin-related securities (“Bitcoin”) in total liquidity of the Trump Media & Technology Group. Source: Trump Media & Technology Group ; With this strategy, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) is now one of the largest Bitcoin holders in the world. As the infographic shows, the company already ranks sixth among all publicly traded companies with Bitcoin holdings – ahead of well-known players like Tesla, Coinbase, and Galaxy Digital. Only companies like MicroStrategy, Marathon Digital, and Block (formerly Square) currently hold larger BTC reserves. This position among the top holders shows the importance Bitcoin has become for TMTG’s strategic financial management – and also highlights how closely intertwined Trump’s media empire is with the cryptocurrency industry. As the infographic shows, Trump Media & Technology Group’s (TMTG) Bitcoin holdings are not only large—they also represent a significant portion of the company’s overall valuation. Approximately 40% of TMTG’s current market capitalization is accounted for by BTC holdings, underscoring the company’s dependence on the Bitcoin price. Despite its massive Bitcoin holdings, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) shares have recently performed significantly weaker than the Bitcoin price itself. As the infographic shows, the stock’s performance is clearly lagging behind the crypto asset – both in the short term and over several months. Donald Trump’s family circle is also deeply involved in the crypto strategy. His sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, are among the co-founders of American Bitcoin. This company has already raised $220 million in institutional capital to finance Bitcoin reserves and mining infrastructure. At the same time, all three Trump sons are co-founders of World Liberty Financial, arguably the most central crypto vehicle in the Trump network; the US President operates there as “co-founder emeritus.” Eric Trump also recently commented publicly on Ethereum. On February 4, he described ETH as a buying opportunity and recently hinted that he sees the cryptocurrency’s fair value at $8,000. The neutrality of this Ethereum forecast can at least be questioned with regard to investments from the surrounding area. According to an analysis by the Washington Post, around 20% of current Trump advisors actively hold cryptocurrencies. This raises questions about the independence of political decision-making processes – especially at a time when crypto regulation and government Bitcoin initiatives are gaining increasing importance. The high proportion of investors in Trump’s immediate circle underscores the close personal and financial ties between politics and digital assets.

2025-07-30T12:04:06,"Best Buy Zones for Memecoins $DOGE, $PEPE, and $BONK Before the Next Price Surge","As Bitcoin (BTC) bulls potentially ready themselves for the next breakout and upward leg of the bull market, the memecoins have proved over recent history that when the market is going up, there is arguably no better place to be. Dogecoin (DOGE), Pepe (PEPE) and Bonk (BONK) are analysed for best buy zones. $DOGE already at edge of buy zone Source: TradingView The daily chart for $DOGE shows that the price has just touched on support. There could well be a reverse back to the upside from here given that all the short-term Stochastic RSI indicators, including the daily, are at their respective bottoms. In fact, the current price level, or perhaps a bit lower at the 5.0 Fibonacci level, are good places for an entry. If, and it’s a big if right now, there is one more quick impulse to the downside for Bitcoin, there is the possibility that $DOGE could fall to the strong support at $0.198, which corresponds with the 0.618 Fibonacci, the ascending trendline, and possibly the 50-day SMA (blue line). Buying at the current level, and setting limit orders down into the green box could be a decent strategy. One more dip for $PEPE takes price into buy zone Source: TradingView The 12-hour chart for $PEPE reveals that the price has dipped below the ascending trendline. While this is not particularly cause for concern, the price is also possibly taking hold below the 0.5 Fibonacci, which is also a support level. If the price continues down (depending on $BTC price movement) buys could start to be made at the 0.618 Fibonacci and into the green box. Once again, all the shorter term Stochastic RSIs are at the bottom, meaning that the next upward impulse could be quite soon. $BONK hits 0.618 Fibonacci level Source: TradingView Since hitting its top after the ascending trendline breakout, the $BONK price has chopped back down and has just touched the 0.618 Fibonacci, the most important of all the levels. A bounce from this point is quite likely. That said, if there is a bit more downside to come, limit buys in the green box could be the way to go. If the price came all the way down to the 0.786 Fibonacci, or the strong support level just above, these could be considered as great retests of this strong support zone, and buys here would be ideal.

According to new regulations from the Indonesian Ministry of Finance, cryptocurrency transactions will be taxed starting August 1, and transactions made on overseas exchanges will be taxed at a higher rate. The tax rate for sellers on domestic platforms will be increased from 0.1% to 0.21%, and for sellers on international platforms, the rate will be increased from 0.2% to 1%. The value added tax (VAT) on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency mining will also rise from 1.1% to 2.2%. Meanwhile, the value-added tax (VAT) previously imposed on buyers will also be abolished. Furthermore, the current 0.1% special income tax on mining will be phased out by 2026, with mining revenues subject to standard personal or corporate tax rates. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are a popular investment option in Southeast Asia's largest economy, where they can be legally bought and sold but not used as payment. According to regulatory data, the total transaction value of cryptocurrencies is expected to triple year-on-year to over 650 trillion rupees ($39.67 billion) in 2024. Crypto exchanges in the country also had over 20 million users in 2024.

2025-07-30T12:00:39,"White House Gears Up to Publish Key Report on U.S. Crypto Strategy","A cryptocurrency task force established by President Donald Trump is expected to release its long-awaited report on Wednesday, detailing the administration’s digital asset policy objectives. According to Reuters , this will be the group’s first public update and will reflect months of behind-the-scenes coordination to craft the White House’s stance on tokenization, crypto markets, and blockchain-based financial products. The report follows Trump’s January executive order, which called for developing a comprehensive national approach to cryptocurrency regulation and innovation. Reuters reports that the policy document will offer guidance on what legislation and regulatory frameworks should be pursued to align with the administration’s pro-crypto goals. One source told Reuters the report is expected to recommend a defined role for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in regulating blockchain-based securities such as tokenized stocks and bonds. A second source indicated that the document would also reflect the administration’s position on ongoing congressional efforts to establish clearer rules for the crypto industry. Mortgage and Retirement Accounts Could Include Crypto One of the most anticipated elements of the upcoming report is the potential inclusion of digital assets in traditional financial systems, particularly mortgages and retirement savings plans like 401(k)s. If implemented, this would represent a landmark shift in how crypto holdings are treated within mainstream finance. “If the report backs the inclusion of digital assets in mortgage assessments and 401(k) plans, it would mark a significant change in how digital asset wealth is treated,” said Liat Shetret, Vice President of Global Policy and Regulation at blockchain analytics firm Elliptic. Such a move could have wide-reaching effects. For homebuyers who hold substantial crypto assets, these could be counted toward their financial profile, potentially increasing mortgage access for a new class of crypto-first consumers. However, it would also introduce new challenges for banks and lenders, including how to assess, verify, and safeguard volatile and decentralized assets. Strategic Reserve and Regulatory Clarity While some in the crypto space are eyeing the possibility of a strategic bitcoin reserve or national digital asset stockpile, experts say that regulatory clarity is far more important. Shetret stresses that institutions are eager for streamlined oversight and consistency. “Many are watching closely for signals around a pro-growth and innovation-friendly federal regulatory framework that balances a commitment to making the U.S. the global center for digital assets while also maintaining financial integrity, adds Shetret. Such a framework would likely involve cross-agency coordination, with defined supervisory roles for the SEC, Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and Treasury. Industry Braces for Policy Impact The release of the report could reshape the U.S. crypto landscape and send ripple effects through global markets. While speculative attention focuses on dramatic initiatives like a bitcoin reserve, the true impact may come from how the U.S. integrates digital assets into legacy financial systems, and the degree to which legal and regulatory ambiguity is resolved. Earlier this month, in a landmark week for the U.S. crypto industry, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law . The move marked a seismic shift in the regulatory framework for digital assets, particularly dollar-backed stablecoins, and indicated a broader push by the Trump administration to bring clarity and control to the sector.

2025-07-30T12:00:03,"eToro CEO Hints At Launching Own Blockchain Following Public Debut","In a recent interview with Fortune, eToro (ETOR) CEO Yoni Assia shared the company’s interest in potentially developing its own blockchain. This exploration comes as the online brokerage, which went public on the Nasdaq in May, evaluates partnerships with various blockchain ecosystems. eToro Reveals Plans For Potential Blockchain Development Assia mentioned that eToro is in discussions with “four or five” different platforms, although he did not disclose specific names. He emphasized that any blockchain launch is not immediate, but indicated that a side chain—essentially a lightweight blockchain built atop another—might be a viable solution for their operations. Assia highlighted the limitations of existing blockchains, stating, “We can’t run today the millions of transactions that we’re transacting on a monthly basis on existing blockchains.” The executive believes that a dedicated blockchain is necessary to support the entire eToro ecosystem and accommodate its user base and transaction volume. The timing of Assia’s comments coincided with eToro’s announcement of its plans to introduce tokenized stocks on the Ethereum blockchain . Tokenization refers to the process of converting traditional stocks into digital assets that can be traded more efficiently on the blockchain. This new feature will allow users to trade tokenized stocks 24/7, with an initial offering of 100 popular US companies and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Currently, access to these blockchain-based assets will be available only to European users on a wait-list basis. ERC20 Tokenized Shares For US Companies Bloomberg further reported that eToro aims to launch tokenized versions of US-listed stocks, enabling round-the-clock trading. The assets will be issued as ERC20 tokens on Ethereum, allowing users to transfer tokenized shares between eToro digital wallets. The platform will initially support 24/5 trading, expanding the accessibility of these assets for users. “This is really the beginning of digital assets and tokenized real-world assets,” Assia stated during a recent webinar. He expressed enthusiasm about merging eToro’s crypto wallet services with the stock trading environment, creating a seamless experience for customers who deal in both cryptocurrencies and traditional equities. This strategic move follows a similar initiative by competitor Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD), which announced plans to offer tokenized US securities to its European customers. However, Robinhood’s announcement faced skepticism from regulators, particularly due to its association with a promotional giveaway of OpenAI “tokens” that were later clarified as derivative contracts rather than actual equity. As of Tuesday’s close, eToro’s stock, ETOR, had dropped 4%, closing at $60 per share. This decline represents a %24 gap from its record peak of $79 reached on June 10.

2025-07-30T12:00:00,"Solana price prediction 2025-2031: Trends and insights for investors","Key takeaways Solana’s price can reach a maximum of $323.40 and an average trading value of $291.75 in 2025. By 2028, SOL is expected to reach a new high of $666.41, driven by mainstream adoption of its dApps. Solana’s price could surpass the $1,000 mark, potentially reaching $1,543.45 or higher by 2031. Despite occasional challenges for Solana ecosystem, including network congestion and competition from other blockchain platforms, the current sentiment shows that Solana demonstrates resilience and adaptability, despite the current price fluctuations, positioning itself as a leading player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 landscape. Overall, the prevailing sentiment within the Solana community reflects the current sentiment of confidence and excitement among investors , driven by the growing interest in Solana with stakeholders eagerly anticipating the platform’s continued evolution and impact on the broader crypto ecosystem. While uncertainties persist, Solana’s innovative approach and robust infrastructure instill optimism for its future price trajectory, as indicated by the technical analysis, solana price forecast and market dominance, particularly when evaluated against momentum indicators. How high can SOL go in 2025 and beyond? Overview Cryptocurrency Solana Token SOL Price $181.34 (-3%) Market Cap $97.57 Billion Trading Volume 24-hour $6.23 Billion Circulating Supply 538.31 Million SOL All-time High $294.33 Jan 19, 2025 All-time Low $0.5052, May 11, 2020 24-hour High $186.49 24-hour Low $178.57 Solana price prediction: Technical analysis Sentiment Bullish 50-Day SMA $159.26 200-Day SMA $163.01 Price Prediction $395.37 (118.42%) F & G Index 41.54 (fear) Green Days 17/30 (57%) 14-Day RSI 67.79 Solana price analysis: SOL faces bearish pressure below $180 TL;DR Breakdown: Solana price analysis shows bearish pressure below $180. Resistance for SOL is at $200 Support for SOL/USD is at $180 The price analysis of Solana for July 30 shows that SOL faced resistance at $185 that triggered a decline toward $175. Solana price analysis 1-day chart: SOL declines below $180 Solana faced selling pressure as buyers defended immediate Fib levels. Current technical suggests a trend correction that pushed the price below $180. Currently, the price is holding momentum around $180, as the bears seek a breakdown towards the $170 level. SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 52.3, showing that the retracement has put the trend back in the healthy zone but shows room for further volatility across the daily charts. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line declines rapidly, suggesting rising selling pressure. Additionally, the MACD candles show rising bearish momentum in the market. SOL/USD 4-hour price chart: Bearish momentum continues to challenge buyers The 4-hour chart for Solana revealed a steady decline as the bears aimed to hold below the $180 price level. The recent rejection plunged the SOL price toward $175 support line. SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview From a technical perspective, the MACD shows rising bearish momentum at -0.84, with the indicator showing rising selling demand with recent candles. This suggests that SOL is yet to find a support at the $180 level. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) dropped to 34, indicating that Solana still has room for further movement in the downward direction across the short term and SOL needs to defend the $175 level to prevent a breakdown towards $170. Solana technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 172.22 BUY EMA 5 $ 165.96 BUY EMA 10 $ 156.89 BUY EMA 21 $ 146.91 BUY EMA 50 $ 146.86 BUY EMA 100 $ 159.56 BUY EMA 200 $ 167.66 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 162.30 BUY SMA 5 $ 174.55 BUY SMA 10 $ 183.94 SELL SMA 21 $ 174.84 BUY SMA 50 $ 161.04 BUY SMA 100 $ 160.85 BUY SMA 200 $ 153.86 BUY What to expect from Solana price analysis? SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview The Solana price analysis across the daily and 1-hour chart indicates minor resistance around $190. The chart suggests a correction before the bulls can continue upwards. As the price falls back towards $185, SOL can be expected to hold at $180, a key level that has been defended previously. However, if the price falls below the $175 level, SOL may fall to the $168 mark. Is SOL a good investment? Solana is a high-performance blockchain platform known for its scalability and speed, boasting a substantial Total Value Locked ( TVL ). The network continues to hit key development milestones. Despite a challenging month, price predictions indicate a more positive outlook, suggesting the potential for future growth. Why is SOL down? As bulls failed to push the SOL price above $190 resistance, it triggered a decline toward the low of $175 level. Currently, price holds above $180 but the mounting bearish pressure might make that consolidation short-lived. What is Solana going to be worth in 2025? The Solana (SOL) price prediction for 2025 suggests a minimum value of $150.06 with an average price of $331.81. The price could reach a maximum of $367.80 during the year. Will SOL reach $1,000? The price forecasts indicate that SOL could reach the $1000 mark by 2030. Given the bullish scenario and the projected positive market sentiment and growth trend, SOL might reach $1,000 within the next five years. Can Solana reach $5,000? Reaching $5,000 is plausible but would likely take several years beyond the current forecast period. However, a snowball in the asset’s adoption might bring the moment sooner. Does SOL have a good long-term future? Yes, Solana has a good long-term future, with a promising market capitalization and exciting potential roi due to its high scalability, low transaction costs, robust ecosystem, and increasing institutional interest. Its growing adoption, strong developer community, and strategic partnerships further enhance Solana’s forecast of its potential for sustained growth.

Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solana-price-prediction/,"SOL|TRADING|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET","Crypto Price Predictions|Solana",cryptocompare

Backed by nearly 80% of community voters in the initial round, the proposal has now reached its final phase: a Treasury Withdrawal vote that will determine whether it gets funded. The strategy comes at a critical time. Cardano has the technology and an active developer community, but it has often struggled with fragmented messaging and minimal visibility at major events. EMURGO’s move is an attempt to resolve that gap and raise awareness of projects like Midnight, Minswap, Claymates, and Ctrl Wallet by placing them on prominent platforms globally. EMURGO funds TOKEN2049 Singapore to start branding revamp EMURGO has already acted on its vision by paying upfront for a significant Cardano showcase at TOKEN2049 Singapore, one of the most influential Web3 conferences globally. This pre-emptive commitment signals urgency from Cardano’s founding entity to set the tone for future events.

The proposal is aimed at correcting that disparity. In addition to brand consolidation, the strategy is expected to give Cardano a stronger competitive stance in the Web3 arena. A funded campaign would help deliver consistent messaging, offer better exposure to builders, and open up new collaboration opportunities for those attending major blockchain summits under the Cardano brand.
