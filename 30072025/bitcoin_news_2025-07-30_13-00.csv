2025-07-30T10:51:08,"Bitcoin's Rise May Be More Difficult From Now On! Analysis Firm Explains Why!","Bitcoin saw a massive surge following Donald Trump's victory in November last year. The rise that began in the last months of 2024 continued in 2025, and BTC reached triple-digit figures. At this point, BTC reached its new ATH of $123,000 in July but subsequently experienced a decline in bullish momentum. Evaluating Bitcoin's recent movements, 10X Research analyst Markus Thielen stated that Bitcoin has entered its weakest period after its impressive rises. 10X Research stated in its latest report that its seasonality model has been consistent with all its predictions so far. Accordingly, this model now signals a bearish trend for BTC. August was Bitcoin's worst month in the last 12 years, with prices falling in eight of those 12. September was no different, with Bitcoin experiencing an average decline of 4.6% in eight of the last 12 years. Citing these data, the analyst stated that apart from seasonal weakness, the slowdown in ETF and capital inflows also increases the risk of a decline. At this point, 10X Research stated that it is more difficult for Bitcoin to reach targets such as $140,000 and $150,000, adding that the price must overcome a crowded resistance level before reaching $140,000. The report noted that Bitcoin's key resistance levels are located around $112,000 and $115,000. Without strong momentum, Bitcoin may struggle to break through these levels, according to the analyst. If the price declines, support zones around $106,000 and $94,000 could come into play. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Bitcoin's Rise May Be More Difficult From Now On!

That’s the mindset pro trader Dentoshi brought to our latest live session, hosted by Kraken’s VP Growth, Matt Howells-Barby. In front of thousands of live viewers, Dentoshi opened up her process for preparing to trade in bullish market conditions – from weekly reviews and chart markups to sector rotation and psychological discipline. Trading a Hot Market w @dentoshi https://t.co/CWjpvv5TRx — Kraken (@krakenfx) July 18, 2025 Here’s what we learned: Start with the trader, not the chart Before opening a single chart, Dentoshi recommends a quick weekly vibe check . “How did I perform last week? Was I emotional? Did I feel FOMO? Did I skip obvious trades or chase bad ones?” Dentoshi keeps her weekly journaling short and focused – no six-hour essays – but always tracks: What setups worked best (and why) What trades did she skip that ended up working out perfectly according to her plan Her emotional state during winners and losers The goal? Spot repeatable patterns and start the week with self-awareness, not baggage. What does a triangle pattern tell traders It signals market consolidation, a pause before a potential breakout. There are 3 types: • Symmetrical • Ascending • Descending Each one offers clues about where price might move next. pic.twitter.com/s405881X2z — Kraken Pro (@krakenpro) June 30, 2025 Build your plan before the market does it for you Dentoshi’s weekly setup begins with anchoring the big picture: Chart the Weekly Close Mark Key Levels – Yearly, quarterly and weekly opens, plus historic support/resistance. Add EMAs – She uses exponential moving averages (like the 100 EMA) to track trend strength. Set Alerts – For breakout levels, EMA tags, or fresh all-time highs – “Save your headspace” by letting alerts do the watching. “You don’t want to keep scrolling through charts all day. I mean, I do – but I also want alerts.” Build a watchlist that works When it comes to tracking potential trades: Keep an active watchlist (~7–10 assets you’re closely watching) Maintain a broader watchlist for key majors or narrative-driven plays Use Kraken Pro’s Markets tab to monitor sector performance (memecoins, DeFi, etc.) Set chart-level favorites so key assets are always a click away Her strategy here? Focus on setups that align with her proven playbook. “I know which setups I win on — I want to see those setups again.” Meme Coins category +4% pic.twitter.com/Q2mCKgtVeY — Kraken Pro (@krakenpro) July 26, 2025 Timing sector rotations With the altcoin market heating up — XRP hitting ATHs, ETH recovering, and meme coins pumping — Dentoshi suggests zooming out and using indicators like: BTC dominance and ETH/BTC charts as indicators of altcoin strength EMAs to gauge potential trend flips Volume rankings to spot outliers If Doge is breaking long-held trendlines and nobody’s talking about it? “That’s when you want to pay attention.” THE (E)MA SERIES.

Part 1: Defining Trend pic.twitter.com/Gb0BHXyeEE — Dentoshi (@Dentoshi) September 19, 2023 Turn patterns into conviction Dentoshi’s edge comes from naming, journaling, and repeating her highest-conviction setups. Examples include: Diagonal breakouts Reclaim patterns Range low deviations EMA crossovers “The patterns show up all the time. But if you’ve named them, reviewed them and traded them before – that’s when you trust the setup.” She doesn’t care what the asset is – only that it’s liquid, has volume and aligns with her triggers. @Dentoshi is in her element explaining flags and pennants.

Scroll your list, not your feed.” Pro tips for heated markets Don’t size up at the top As Dentoshi referenced from GCR , “Size up at the beginning of a move. Size down toward the end.” This is easier said than done, and most people do the opposite. Separate trades from investments Dentoshi splits her portfolio into trading and conviction investments, with different rules for each. Define exits with context Exits depend on positioning, macro sentiment, using S/R and belief in the asset. Stick to the plan: There’s no perfect top, only a well-informed strategy. Stay honest Regular review, even if short, keeps ego in check. “No plan survives contact with the market – unless it’s yours.” Recap: Your weekly trader checklist Review last week – What worked, what didn’t, how you felt Journal briefly – Focus on behavior and edge Mark charts – Weekly, quarterly, and yearly opens Add EMAs – Identify trend strength and crossovers Set alerts – For breakouts, pullbacks, and key price zones Create watchlists – 7–10 active, plus broader market narrative Use tools – Kraken Pro , Coinalyze, Twitter Lists Prep setups – Name your patterns and wait for your shot; define your risk and map out your plan.

2025-07-30T10:45:22,"XRP Army Expects Big News As White House Is Set for Today’s Announcement","XRP Army is waiting to hear big news today as the White House is set to release its first crypto policy report and digital asset stockpile. A tweet from crypto commentator Xaif has drawn attention to a major policy announcement scheduled for release today by the Trump administration. According to the tweet, the United States government is set to unveil its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile in its first formal national crypto policy report. Xaif highlights the potential inclusion of XRP in the government’s digital asset holdings, based on prior remarks made by Bo Hines, Executive Director of the White House’s President’s Council of Advisers on Digital Assets. Xaif’s tweet references statements made by Bo Hines earlier in the year, suggesting that the U.S. digital asset stockpile might not be limited to Bitcoin. This assertion is tied to a public statement from March 21 , where Bo Hines reportedly mentioned Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Cardano, and Solana as possible components of a separate U.S. crypto stockpile. BREAKING: The U.S. Government to unveil its #Bitcoin Strategic Reserve & Digital Asset Stockpile today! Bo Hines suggests $XRP might be on the list… Is America secretly stacking XRP ? https://t.co/zrj8FJBRHL pic.twitter.com/vz5isi6Hl2 — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) July 30, 2025 White House to Reveal Contents of Strategic Bitcoin Reserve The expectation surrounding today’s announcement has increased since Squawk Box Asia, a CNBC business news program, aired a video report confirming the upcoming release. According to the broadcast, the Trump administration intends to publish its first detailed crypto stockpile report today, outlining the structure and composition of the government’s digital asset reserves. These holdings include cryptocurrencies seized through legal enforcement actions and assets purchased for strategic purposes under what is being called the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 National Security and Regulatory Implications Also Anticipated The report is also expected to contain recommendations related to national security, banking access for crypto-related entities, and federal custody policies. Market analysts anticipate the report may signal a more structured and assertive approach to digital asset management at the national level. Bo Hines’ involvement, combined with his previous reference to XRP and other altcoins, has drawn significant interest from the XRP community. Bo Hines’ Prior Statement Puts XRP in Focus The idea that XRP may be included in the federal crypto stockpile has led to speculation about the government’s assessment of its long-term utility. As the Executive Director of the crypto working group at the White House, Bo Hines has held a prominent position in shaping national crypto strategy under the Trump administration. His previous comments, cited by a former Fox Business journalist, aligned with the growing belief among digital asset advocates that the U.S. government may be quietly acquiring assets it believes are essential to the future of blockchain-based financial infrastructure. XRP’s Potential Recognition Marks a Key Moment The implications of such a development are significant. If XRP is mentioned in the official report, it would be the first time the U.S. government publicly acknowledges holding the token or considering it for strategic use. This comes at a time when legal clarity around XRP is beginning to solidify, following court developments in the ongoing litigation between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Crypto market participants, particularly the XRP community, are closely monitoring the release of today’s report for specific references to digital assets beyond Bitcoin. Many anticipate that the White House’s approach could shape the framework for how federal agencies interact with and regulate cryptocurrency in the coming years.

This significant capital injection comes from World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a DeFi project with reported links to the Trump family. This isn’t just about money; it’s a strategic alliance that could fundamentally reshape how we think about stablecoins and the future of an on-chain dollar standard. Let’s dive into what this groundbreaking development means for Falcon Finance and the broader crypto ecosystem. The Game-Changing Investment: What Does This Mean for Falcon Finance? On a recent announcement via its official X account, Falcon Finance confirmed the substantial $10 million strategic investment from World Liberty Financial. This isn’t merely a cash infusion; it represents a vote of confidence in Falcon Finance ‘s vision and its potential to innovate within the DeFi sector. For a project like Falcon Finance , such an investment brings a multitude of immediate and long-term benefits: Enhanced Development: The capital can accelerate the development of new features, improve existing protocols, and scale infrastructure to support a growing user base. This means faster rollouts of new tools and a more robust platform for users. Market Expansion: With increased resources, Falcon Finance can broaden its reach, attracting more users and institutional partners, potentially solidifying its position in the competitive DeFi landscape. This could involve targeted marketing campaigns and strategic outreach. Talent Acquisition: A robust financial backing allows Falcon Finance to attract top-tier talent in blockchain development, security, and marketing, further strengthening its core team. Bringing in leading experts can drive innovation and security improvements. Increased Liquidity: The investment can directly contribute to deeper liquidity pools, making the platform more robust and attractive for large-scale transactions. Deeper liquidity reduces slippage and makes the platform more efficient for all participants. This strategic move positions Falcon Finance not just as a participant, but as a potential leader in the evolving narrative of decentralized finance, particularly in the realm of stablecoins and collateralized lending. It signifies a maturation of the DeFi space, attracting significant capital from diverse sources. Understanding World Liberty Financial (WLFI) and Its Connection to Falcon Finance World Liberty Financial (WLFI) is a DeFi project that has garnered attention due to its reported links to the Trump family. While the exact nature of these links is often subject to discussion, WLFI aims to establish itself as a significant player in the decentralized finance space, particularly through its USD1 stablecoin. The partnership with Falcon Finance is a testament to WLFI’s ambition to expand the utility and adoption of its stablecoin. The strategic alignment between WLFI and Falcon Finance is multifaceted, demonstrating how different entities can converge in the pursuit of decentralized financial innovation: Shared Vision for Stablecoins: Both entities appear to share a vision for the widespread adoption and utility of stablecoins as a cornerstone of the future financial system. They recognize the need for stable, reliable digital assets in a volatile crypto market. Interoperability: WLFI’s USD1 stablecoin is already accepted as collateral on Falcon Finance , creating a direct bridge between their ecosystems and enhancing the utility of USD1. This integration makes USD1 a more versatile asset within the DeFi lending environment. Market Reach: WLFI’s association, whether direct or indirect, with a prominent political family can bring unique visibility and a distinct user base to the partnership, potentially introducing a new demographic to the DeFi world via Falcon Finance . This could accelerate mainstream awareness and adoption. This collaboration highlights a growing trend where established or politically connected entities are exploring and investing in the burgeoning DeFi sector, seeking to merge traditional financial influence with decentralized innovation. It also raises questions about the evolving nature of decentralization as more traditional players enter the space. The Rise of USD1: How Falcon Finance is Paving the Way for a New On-Chain Dollar Standard One of the most compelling aspects of this partnership is the role of WLFI’s USD1 stablecoin. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to minimize price volatility, typically by pegging their value to a stable asset like the US dollar. USD1 aims to be a reliable digital dollar, and its acceptance as collateral on Falcon Finance is a critical step towards establishing what the projects refer to as a ‘new on-chain dollar standard’. What does an ‘on-chain dollar standard’ entail, and why is it significant for the future of finance? An on-chain dollar standard would mean that a widely accepted, transparent, and decentralized digital representation of the US dollar becomes the primary medium for transactions and collateral within the blockchain ecosystem. This vision offers several profound advantages: Efficiency and Speed: Transactions would be settled instantly and globally, without the delays and costs associated with traditional banking systems. This means near-instantaneous transfers and settlements across borders. Transparency: All transactions are recorded on a public ledger, offering unprecedented transparency and auditability. This can reduce fraud and increase trust in financial systems. Accessibility: It could democratize access to financial services for the unbanked and underbanked globally, allowing anyone with an internet connection to participate in a robust financial system, regardless of their geographical location or traditional banking access. Reduced Intermediaries: By operating on-chain, the need for numerous intermediaries is reduced, potentially lowering fees and increasing financial autonomy for individuals and businesses. Falcon Finance ‘s integration of USD1 as collateral is a tangible step in this direction, demonstrating how a stablecoin can be leveraged beyond simple transfers, becoming a foundational asset for lending and other complex DeFi operations. This move could inspire other platforms to adopt similar standards, gradually building a robust, interconnected on-chain financial system that is more resilient and equitable. Strategic Implications for Falcon Finance and the Broader DeFi Landscape The strategic investment in Falcon Finance by WLFI carries significant implications, not just for the immediate parties but for the entire decentralized finance ecosystem. This partnership could serve as a blueprint for future collaborations between established entities and innovative DeFi protocols, shaping the trajectory of the industry. Benefits for the DeFi Landscape: Increased Mainstream Adoption: The involvement of entities with broader public recognition, even through association, can help demystify DeFi and attract a wider audience beyond early adopters. This bridges the gap between the crypto niche and general public awareness. Legitimacy and Trust: While some may view political ties with skepticism, others might see it as a sign of increasing legitimacy and institutional interest in the DeFi space. This can encourage more traditional investors and businesses to explore decentralized solutions. Innovation Catalyst: The substantial funding can fuel further innovation in stablecoin utility, decentralized lending, and other DeFi primitives, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible on-chain. This includes advancements in smart contracts, security, and user experience. Liquidity Influx: Such investments bring not only capital but also potential new users and assets into the DeFi ecosystem, contributing to overall market depth and stability. Increased liquidity benefits all users through better pricing and faster execution. Challenges and Considerations: Regulatory Scrutiny: Any project with political ties, especially one dealing with financial instruments like stablecoins, is likely to face intense regulatory scrutiny. Falcon Finance and WLFI will need to navigate this complex landscape carefully, potentially setting precedents for future regulations. Public Perception: The association with a politically charged figure can be a double-edged sword, potentially alienating some segments of the crypto community while attracting others. Managing public perception through transparent communication will be crucial. Decentralization Ethos: Some purists in the DeFi community might view such partnerships as a step away from the core tenets of decentralization, raising questions about influence and control. Balancing these concerns with growth opportunities is a delicate act. Despite these challenges, the overall impact of this investment could be profoundly positive, accelerating the maturation and integration of DeFi into the global financial fabric, proving that decentralized systems can attract significant traditional capital. Navigating the Future: Challenges and Opportunities for Falcon Finance As Falcon Finance embarks on this new chapter, it faces a dynamic landscape filled with both opportunities and challenges. The $10 million investment from WLFI provides a powerful springboard, but sustained success will depend on strategic execution and adaptability in a rapidly evolving market. Key Opportunities for Falcon Finance: Pioneering the On-Chain Standard: By actively integrating USD1 and promoting its use as collateral, Falcon Finance has a unique opportunity to lead the charge in establishing a robust on-chain dollar standard, attracting users seeking stability and utility in their DeFi interactions. Expanding Product Offerings: The increased capital can fund the expansion of Falcon Finance ‘s product suite beyond current offerings, potentially including new lending products, derivatives, or even a decentralized exchange, catering to a broader range of financial needs. Global Reach: Leveraging the visibility brought by WLFI, Falcon Finance can target a wider, more diverse international user base, solidifying its global presence and becoming a truly international DeFi protocol. Strategic Partnerships: The success of this partnership could open doors for further collaborations with other major players in the crypto and traditional finance sectors, creating a network effect for growth. Challenges to Address: Regulatory Compliance: Staying ahead of evolving global regulations for stablecoins and DeFi protocols will be paramount. Proactive engagement with regulators and legal experts can mitigate risks and ensure long-term viability. Security: As the platform grows and handles more assets, maintaining top-tier security measures to prevent hacks and exploits will be a continuous challenge. Regular audits and robust bug bounty programs are essential. Competition: The DeFi space is highly competitive. Falcon Finance must continue to innovate and differentiate itself to retain and grow its user base against established and emerging rivals, offering unique value propositions. Community Governance: As a decentralized project, balancing the influence of large investors like WLFI with the principles of community governance will be a delicate act. Ensuring a fair and transparent governance model is crucial for long-term decentralization. For users, keeping an eye on Falcon Finance ‘s roadmap and announcements will be crucial. The project’s ability to navigate these complexities will determine its long-term impact on the DeFi landscape and its success in establishing a new financial paradigm. The $10 million strategic investment in Falcon Finance by World Liberty Financial marks a significant moment in the DeFi narrative. It underscores the growing convergence of traditional influence and decentralized innovation, particularly around the crucial role of stablecoins. By integrating WLFI’s USD1 as collateral, Falcon Finance is not just securing funding; it’s actively building the infrastructure for a more efficient, transparent, and accessible on-chain dollar standard. While the journey ahead will undoubtedly present challenges, this partnership has the potential to propel Falcon Finance to the forefront of the DeFi revolution, shaping the future of digital finance for years to come. This is a story of ambition, innovation, and the relentless pursuit of a decentralized financial future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Falcon Finance?

2025-07-30T10:39:12,"When the Market Turns Red, XYZVerse Stays Green: Why This Sports Meme Coin Could Still 50x as BTC Dips","As Bitcoin slips, most coins follow. Yet a lively sports meme coin, XYZVerse, moves the opposite way. Charts show steady gains while wider prices sink. Analysts note a blend of fan passion, clever rewards, and tight supply. Could this outsider jump fifty-fold before the next rebound arrives? The details behind the surge wait below. Eager holders refuse to sell so far. Undervalued $XYZ Meme Coin Gears Up for Listing on a Major CEX XYZVerse ($XYZ) is the meme coin that has grabbed headlines with its ambitious claim of rising from $0.0001 to $0.1 during a presale phase. So far, it has gone halfway, raising over $15 million, and the price of the $XYZ token currently stands at $0.005 . At the next 14th stage of the presale, the $XYZ token value will further rise to $0.01 , meaning that early investors have the chance to secure a bigger discount. Following the presale, $XYZ will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The team has not disclosed the details yet, but they have put a teaser for a big launch. Born for Fighters, Built for Champions XYZVerse is building a community for those hungry for big profits in crypto — the relentless, the ambitious, the ones aiming for dominance. This is a coin for true fighters — a mindset that resonates with athletes and sports fans alike. $XYZ is the token for thrill-seekers chasing the next big meme coin. Central to the XYZVerse story is XYZepe — a fighter in the meme coin arena, battling to climb the charts and make it to the top on CoinMarketCap. Will it become the next DOGE or SHIB? Time will tell. Community-First Vibes In XYZVerse, the community runs the show. Active participants earn hefty rewards, and the team has allocated a massive 10% of the total token supply — around 10 billion $XYZ — for airdrops, making it one of the largest airdrops on record. Backed by solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and regular token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every move is designed to boost momentum, drive price growth, and rally a loyal community that knows this could be the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More — Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Bitcoin (BTC) Source: TradingView Bitcoin trades between $116040 and $121488 after a quiet but steady week. The coin edged up 1.27% in 7 days, adding to the pop it booked over the past month. A 10.73% surge in 30 days and a 14.64% climb in 6 months show a clear uptrend that keeps traders upbeat. The 10-day average sits near $118414, almost on top of the 100-day line at $117888. Such tight clustering hints at stability before the next move. Momentum gauges lean mildly bullish with mid-range readings that leave room for fresh bids. If buyers stay active, the chart suggests a push above the ceiling at $123578 could happen soon. A break of that cap would open the path to $129026, roughly 5% above the current top or 9% from the middle of today’s band. If sellers take charge instead, the first safety net lies at $112681, about 5% below, with deeper cover near $107232, a slip of around 9%. Given the solid half-year gains and still moderate momentum, odds favor a gradual grind higher, yet the tight range warns that any move will likely be sharp once the stalemate ends. Conclusion BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and XRP remain strong in the 2025 surge, yet XYZVerse stands out as the first all-sport memecoin, eyeing 50x gains through unmatched fan-driven momentum.

2025-07-30T10:25:10,"Urgent Bitcoin Price Prediction: Why BTC Could Plunge to $110K","BitcoinWorld Urgent Bitcoin Price Prediction: Why BTC Could Plunge to $110K Are you keeping a close eye on the volatile world of cryptocurrency? If so, you’re likely aware that Bitcoin (BTC) has been on a rollercoaster ride. Recent market movements suggest that the flagship cryptocurrency might be heading for a significant correction, potentially revisiting the $110,000 mark. This isn’t just a speculative guess; it’s an analysis backed by on-chain data and market dynamics, particularly concerning the latest Bitcoin price prediction . Understanding the Low-Volume “Air Gap” in Bitcoin Price Prediction Imagine a highway where traffic suddenly accelerates, leaving a vast, empty stretch behind. In financial markets, something similar can happen, and it’s called a low-volume “air gap.” This phenomenon occurs when an asset’s price surges rapidly through a specific range with very little trading activity. For Bitcoin, the recent swift climb from $110,000 to $115,000 created just such a void. Cointelegraph, citing data from the renowned on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, highlighted this crucial observation. What is an Air Gap? It’s a price range where minimal transactions occurred during a rapid ascent or descent. Think of it as a missing rung on a ladder – if the price needs to come down, there’s little support to slow its fall through that empty space. Why is it Significant? These gaps suggest limited investor interest or participation in that particular price zone during the initial move. This lack of activity makes the area vulnerable, as there aren’t many buyers or sellers positioned to defend the price if it starts to retrace. A Magnet for Price Reversion: Historically, such gaps often act like magnets, pulling the price back to “fill” the void. It’s not a guaranteed outcome, but it’s a strong indicator that traders and analysts closely monitor. The Role of Short-Term Holders in This Bitcoin Price Prediction Another critical factor contributing to this potential correction is the behavior of short-term holders (STHs). These are investors who typically hold their Bitcoin for less than 155 days. Glassnode’s data reveals that STHs have heavily accumulated BTC in the $117,000–$122,000 range. While accumulation by new entrants can be a sign of growing interest, heavy concentration in a specific, relatively high range can also signal vulnerability. Why does STH accumulation matter for our Bitcoin price prediction ? Profit-Taking Pressure: STHs are often more sensitive to price fluctuations and quicker to take profits or cut losses. If the price dips, these holders might be more inclined to sell, adding selling pressure to the market. Reduced Conviction: Unlike long-term holders who are typically unfazed by short-term volatility, STHs might lack the strong conviction to hold through significant drawdowns. Their entry at higher price points means their breakeven is closer to current levels, making them more susceptible to panic selling. Liquidity Dynamics: A large cohort of STHs holding at similar price points can create a significant liquidity pool that, if triggered, could exacerbate a downward move. Is This Similar to CME Futures Gaps? Let’s Compare! The concept of an “air gap” in spot markets shares similarities with unfilled gaps in CME Group Bitcoin futures. For those unfamiliar, CME futures gaps occur when the futures market opens at a price significantly different from its closing price, often over a weekend. These gaps, too, are frequently cited as potential magnets for price reversion. While the mechanics differ (one is a futures market phenomenon, the other a spot market liquidity void), the underlying principle is similar: a lack of trading activity in a specific price range creates an area of weakness that the market might eventually seek to re-test or fill. However, it’s crucial to remember that not all gaps are filled, and the timing of any potential fill is unpredictable. Glassnode emphasizes that the $110,000–$115,000 region is a critical support zone that requires close monitoring. Here’s a quick comparison: Feature Low-Volume “Air Gap” (Spot Market) CME Futures Gap Origin Rapid price movement with low trading volume. Difference between futures market close and next open (often over weekends). Nature Represents a lack of liquidity/support. Represents a sudden shift in market sentiment/valuation. Impact Potential for price to retrace and find support/resistance. Often seen as areas the price tends to revert to. Predictability An indicator, not a guarantee. Historically a strong tendency to fill, but not always. What Happens if This Bitcoin Price Prediction Holds True? If Bitcoin does indeed revisit the $110,000 mark, it would signify a notable correction from its recent highs. For many, this might sound alarming, but in the context of Bitcoin’s historical volatility, such pullbacks are not uncommon. They often serve as healthy corrections, flushing out overleveraged positions and allowing the market to reset before potentially continuing an upward trend. The $110,000 level is not just a psychological round number; it’s also a zone where significant investor activity was observed before the rapid ascent. This means that if the price descends to this level, it might find substantial buying interest, turning it into a strong support zone. Traders will be keenly watching for signs of accumulation at this level, which could signal a bounce. Conversely, a decisive break below $110,000 could open the door for further downside, potentially testing lower support levels. Navigating the Volatility: Actionable Insights for Investors Understanding these market dynamics is one thing; knowing how to react is another. For investors, particularly those new to the crypto space, volatility can be daunting. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Regularly check reliable sources for on-chain analysis and market reports. Glassnode and Cointelegraph are excellent starting points for in-depth data. Risk Management is Key: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Consider setting stop-loss orders to limit potential downside if the price moves against your position. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market perfectly, consider investing a fixed amount at regular intervals. This strategy can help mitigate the impact of volatility by averaging out your purchase price over time. Long-Term Perspective: Bitcoin has historically recovered from significant drawdowns. While short-term corrections can be sharp, a long-term hodling strategy has often proven rewarding for patient investors. Diversify: While Bitcoin is a dominant force, diversifying your portfolio across other cryptocurrencies and asset classes can help spread risk. It’s essential to approach these market signals with a balanced perspective. While the “air gap” and STH accumulation point to potential weakness, the broader bullish sentiment and institutional adoption trends for Bitcoin remain strong. Corrections are a natural part of any market cycle, offering opportunities for new entries or portfolio rebalancing. The Broader Market Context: Beyond the Gap While the low-volume gap and STH behavior are crucial short-term indicators, it’s important to zoom out and consider the broader market context that influences any Bitcoin price prediction . Macroeconomic factors, regulatory developments, and institutional interest continue to play significant roles in Bitcoin’s trajectory. Global Economy: Inflation concerns, interest rate decisions by central banks, and geopolitical events can all sway investor sentiment towards risk assets like Bitcoin. Regulatory Landscape: Clarity (or lack thereof) from regulators regarding cryptocurrencies can significantly impact market confidence and adoption. Positive regulatory frameworks tend to encourage institutional participation. Institutional Adoption: The continued entry of major financial institutions, corporations, and even sovereign wealth funds into the Bitcoin space provides a strong long-term demand floor. Products like Bitcoin ETFs are making it easier for traditional investors to gain exposure. Halving Cycle: Bitcoin’s halving events, which reduce the supply of new BTC, have historically been precursors to major bull runs. While the most recent halving occurred recently, its long-term effects on supply dynamics are still unfolding. These elements create a complex tapestry. A short-term correction might be influenced by the on-chain data, but the long-term outlook for Bitcoin is often shaped by these larger forces. Understanding this interplay allows for a more nuanced and resilient investment strategy. Conclusion: Navigating the Waves of Bitcoin Volatility The analysis suggesting Bitcoin could revisit $110,000 due to a low-volume “air gap” and heavy short-term holder accumulation provides a crucial insight into current market vulnerabilities. While not a guaranteed outcome, these on-chain signals from Glassnode, as reported by Cointelegraph, highlight a critical support zone that deserves attention from every investor. Just like the potential for CME futures gaps to be filled, these spot market liquidity voids can act as magnets for price reversion, presenting both risks and potential opportunities. In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, vigilance and a well-informed strategy are your best allies. Whether Bitcoin corrects to $110,000 or finds new support levels, understanding the underlying market mechanics will empower you to make more confident decisions. Remember, market corrections are a natural part of the cycle, often paving the way for future growth. Stay calm, stay informed, and always prioritize sound risk management. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a low-volume “air gap” in Bitcoin’s price? A low-volume “air gap” refers to a price range through which Bitcoin moved very quickly with minimal trading activity. This creates a void in liquidity and support, making the area potentially vulnerable to a price pullback as the market might seek to re-test or “fill” this empty zone. Q2: Why is short-term holder (STH) accumulation significant for the Bitcoin price prediction ? Short-term holders (STHs) typically have a shorter investment horizon and are more prone to profit-taking or panic selling during price dips. High accumulation by STHs in a specific price range, especially a higher one, can indicate increased selling pressure if the market turns bearish, as these holders may liquidate their positions to avoid losses. Q3: How reliable are Glassnode’s insights for Bitcoin price prediction ? Glassnode is a highly respected on-chain analytics platform that provides deep insights into blockchain data. Their metrics track investor behavior, network activity, and market structure directly from the blockchain, offering a unique perspective often used by institutional and professional investors to inform their strategies. While no prediction is 100% accurate, Glassnode’s data is considered highly reliable for understanding underlying market dynamics. Q4: Does a low-volume gap always get filled? No, not all low-volume gaps or CME futures gaps are necessarily filled. While they often act as magnets for price reversion, various market factors, news events, or strong buying/selling pressure can prevent a gap from being filled, or delay it significantly. They are indicators to monitor, not guarantees. Q5: What should investors do if Bitcoin corrects to $110,000? If Bitcoin corrects to $110,000, investors should reassess their strategy based on their risk tolerance and long-term goals. It could be an opportunity for dollar-cost averaging (DCA) or a new entry for those looking to buy the dip. Conversely, it might signal a need to re-evaluate risk exposure for those with highly leveraged positions. Always consider market fundamentals and your personal financial situation.

2025-07-30T10:22:42,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: OG Whale Dumps 80,000 BTC – And Bitcoin Still Looks Ready to Blast Higher","Bitcoin remains impressively stable near $118,000 even after a massive over-the-counter sale of 80,000 BTC, worth over $9 billion, hit the market. The transaction, executed by Galaxy Digital and tied to dormant Satoshi-era wallets from 2011, caused a brief 4% price drop last week. However, BTC quickly recovered, underscoring the strength of institutional demand. According to K33 Research’s Vetle Lunde, institutional investors and Bitcoin-linked products collectively accumulated 115,165 BTC in July. Even after subtracting the whale’s sale, net flows still show a surplus of 35,165 BTC. This strong absorption capacity is keeping Bitcoin afloat amid heavy selling pressure. #Ethereum open interest dominance has climbed to nearly 40%, its highest level since April 2023. Only 5% of days have seen a higher reading. This marks a clear shift in speculative focus, with capital rotating from $BTC to $ETH at the margin. pic.twitter.com/yNKLe9gJKt — glassnode (@glassnode) July 29, 2025 Meanwhile, technicals show a symmetrical triangle on a 4-hour timeframe. The pattern is formed by lower highs and higher lows and usually precedes a breakout. The resistance is at $120,283, and the trendline support at $117,000 is being watched by traders. Derivatives Market Signals Tension While spot is calm, Bitcoin derivatives are showing tension. Open interest in BTC perpetual futures has gone above 300,000 BTC, levels not seen since November 2024. Interestingly, funding rates are neutral, so the leverage is probably driven by institutional hedging rather than pure speculation. Lunde notes this could be OTC desks like Galaxy hedging their large sales through short futures positions. This keeps funding rates in check, but the high open interest could lead to liquidation cascades if a big move triggers stop-outs on both sides. Key points: BTC perpetual open interest above 300K BTC Funding rates are neutral, despite leverage Support at $117K, resistance at $120.3K Watch for volume on a breakout Ethereum Sees Growing Institutional Flows While Bitcoin holds, Ethereum is seeing clear institutional demand. Since mid-June, ETH ETFs have absorbed over 1.6 million ETH, more than the total of the previous 11 months combined. This momentum helped ETH gain 52% over the past month and pushed the ETHBTC ratio to 0.032, its highest reading since January. #Ethereum open interest dominance has climbed to nearly 40%, its highest level since April 2023. Only 5% of days have seen a higher reading. This marks a clear shift in speculative focus, with capital rotating from $BTC to $ETH at the margin. pic.twitter.com/yNKLe9gJKt — glassnode (@glassnode) July 29, 2025 CME data shows that non-leveraged institutional players added 527,000 ETH in July alone, signaling directional long bets. Glassnode reports that Ethereum’s perpetual open interest dominance has risen to nearly 40%, a level rarely seen since early 2023. This shift hints at speculative rotation away from Bitcoin, at least temporarily. With U.S. macro catalysts looming, including the FOMC rate decision, Trump’s tariff deadline on Aug. 1, and a potential White House crypto report, traders should expect sharp volatility across both BTC and ETH. Bitcoin Technical Outlook: Symmetrical Triangle Forming Technically, Bitcoin is inside a symmetrical triangle on the 4-hour chart, with price coiling between lower highs and rising trendline support. This is a setup for a big breakout. BTC is currently at $118,000, just below the 50-SMA at $118,204, which is now acting as resistance. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The RSI is at 48, neutral but rising, so momentum is building. Price just bounced off the ascending support at $117,025 and is making higher lows, which is bullish accumulation. Several small candles, including Dojis and spinning tops, are showing market indecision, which is common before a breakout. Key levels to watch: Resistance: $120,283 (top of triangle) Breakout targets: $122,845 and $125,408 Support: $117,025 then $114,532 and $111,799 If BTC breaks above $120,283 with volume and RSI strength, we should see momentum to $125K. A break below $117K could see support at $111,799. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Over $5.7M as Price Rise Nears Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), has raised over $5.7 million in its public presale, with $5,700,020 out of a $6,102,789 target.

2025-07-30T10:20:32,"XRP wipes out over $22 billion in a week; Is the rally over?","XRP has erased more than $22 billion in market capitalization over the past week, a sobering reversal for one of 2025’s standout altcoins. Data retrieved by Finbold from CoinMarketCap shows its market cap plunging from roughly $205.9 billion on July 23 to $183.4 billion as of July 30, a 10% drawdown that reflects both profit-taking and structural weakness across the broader altcoin complex. XRP 1-week market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap The price action tells the same story. After briefly touching $3.47, XRP plunged below the psychologically critical $3 level on July 24, printing a low of $2.99 before clawing back to $3.09 at press time. That breach of $3, however brief, will not go unnoticed by traders, many of whom now view that level as a battleground between opportunistic buyers and momentum-driven sellers. XRP ledger and open interest Derivatives markets underscore the cooling sentiment. CoinGlass data reviewed by Finbold shows open interest in XRP futures sliding to $8.57 billion, a clear signal that leveraged traders are de-risking after the latest leg down. XRP futures open interest. Source: CoinGlass When open interest declines in tandem with spot prices, it often indicates that speculative long positions are being flushed out, a necessary reset, but one that can accelerate downside if fresh demand doesn’t step in. For now, XRP sits precariously above support at $3. A sustained break below could open the door to a retest of the $2.80–$2.90 range, while holding this level might set the stage for a period of consolidation before any renewed attempt at $3.50. As always, the macro backdrop matters: Bitcoin dominance continues to creep higher, siphoning capital away from altcoins, and Ripple’s regulatory overhang hasn’t disappeared. In short, XRP’s rally isn’t necessarily over, but this is the first meaningful test of its staying power since its early summer breakout. Whether bulls can defend $3 will dictate the next chapter.

2025-07-30T10:13:34,"BITO: There Are Better Ways To Play Bitcoin (Technical Analysis)","Summary BITO's technicals show balanced support/resistance, but a double top and weak momentum signal a potential bearish reversal. Bullish momentum is fading, with MACD, RSI, and stochastics all confirming weakening bulls and rising downside risk. BITO's structure offers high yield but comes with higher risk and expenses compared to ARKB and IBIT peers. Given the elevated risk, high fees, and weak technicals, I find BITO unattractive for investors seeking Bitcoin exposure. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has regained its mojo after Trump's election win as his administration has promised a favorable regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies. One of the ways to play Bitcoin is through the ProShares Bitcoin ETF (NYSEARCA: BITO ), but as you can see below, the fund has diverged from the underlying asset. This is due to a unique structure in which the ETF has a monstrous dividend yield and so investors can easily reinvest if they wish to do so. In the below technical analysis, it is shown that while support and resistance are relatively balanced, bullish momentum is weak and a double top suggests the potential of a bearish reversal. Near the end of this article, it is also discussed that the ETF has higher risk and expenses than peers and so I believe that BITO is unattractive for investors looking for Bitcoin exposure. Seeking Alpha Trend Lines Are Converging Yahoo Finance For today's technical analysis, I will first look at some key support and resistance zones for the ETF as well as some of the trends. Currently, BITO is in a longer term uptrend that began back in early April. That trend line was most recently support at the start of July. However, in the near term, a potential downtrend may have been forming since early to mid July. As these trend lines converge, it will be interesting to see which way the ETF breaks out. For support, there are three key levels that investors should keeps their eyes on. The area around 21.8 could come to the rescue soon as a major July gap up occurred there. The 20.8 level should also be significant support since that area was resistance back in March and April. Lastly, the 19.7s could also be support as a late March peak occurred there and an early May trough also occurred there. While there is significant support, resistance is also abundant. Just above 23, there may be resistance as that price level was a key obstacle for BITO in the second half of February. As you can see in the above chart, the next source of resistance is a double top pattern at about 23.5. This could be a sign that a bearish reversal is in the cards and so investors should be on the look out for further signs of technical weakness. Lastly, there may be considerable resistance in the 24.5s as well since a major February gap down occurred there. Momentum Is Weak Yahoo Finance In the above discussion, it was shown that the ETF had relatively balanced support and resistance. Now we turn to see how momentum is playing out for BITO. For the long term, the 50 day SMA broke above the 200 day SMA in early July for a golden cross. That indicated the arrival of a bullish period. However, the 50 day SMA's trajectory has been weak and the deviation between the SMAs has failed to expand in a strong manner. Therefore it seems that long term bulls are still hesitating as clearly momentum has not been ideal. For the near term, let's first look at the EMAs. The 9 day EMA had a bullish crossover with the 21 day EMA also in early July to show strength. After expanding, the gap between the EMAs has started to narrow and so near term bullishness is now receding. The ETF has also broken below the 9 day EMA and so there is some notable weakness in the bulls. For the MACD, a bullish crossover occurred in early July as well. The histogram was quite strong for a period but note that the past 8 bars have been red and so momentum has weakened significantly. In fact, a bearish crossover seems to be imminent to reflect near term bearishness. From the above moving averages and MACD indicator, I believe it is clear that bullish momentum is weak and near term momentum is actually at risk of turning bearish. As an aside, note that the MACD confirms the double top in BITO. At the ETF's July peak, the indicator made a much lower high than back at the ETF's high in May. Therefore, there is a good chance for a bearish reversal. We'll look at more signs of confirmation a little later. Bulls Are Still In Control - For Now Yahoo Finance The ETF broke above the Bollinger Bands midline in early July to show that the bulls have taken control. BITO actually went on to break above the upper band and so perhaps the near term downtrend could be seen as an overbought pullback. In recent days, the ETF has pulled back to near the midline and so while the bulls seem to still be in control, there should definitely be some cautiousness. The RSI shows a similar story. The indicator nearly hit 70 in the first half of July to show dominant bulls but has now receded to a reading of just 53.71. Therefore, the bulls are now only in control by a modest margin as the bears have reclaimed a significant amount of lost ground. Lastly, for the stochastics, a key bearish crossover occurred between the %K and %D in early to mid July and both lines have fallen out of the the 80+ zone to show weakened bulls. The %K is now dropping dangerously close to the 50 level. As another confirmation signal of the double top and bearish reversal, the RSI also made a lower high at the July peak than back at the May peak for the ETF. This can be seen as a top failure swing by traders. With two key indicators showing that there is potential for significant downside, investors should be aware of the technical risk. A Few Noteworthy Items As stated in the introduction, the ETF has a unique structure since it has an enormous yield. The fund is weighted towards providing income rather than capital gains. BITO also differs from competing ETFs as it uses derivatives and futures rather than investing directly into the underlying asset, Bitcoin. Risk Is Higher Vs. Peers Data by YCharts ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ) and iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) are two competing funds also allowing for easy exposure to the cryptocurrency. In the the above chart you can see that the standard deviation for both of these two ETFs are much lower than for BITO. ARKB and IBIT are both rated as a D- for risk by Seeking Alpha but note that BITO is rated at an even worse rating of F. This rating involves more than just standard deviation but I believe this brief discussion shows that BITO is quite risky in the grand scheme of things. Expenses Could Be A Deterrent In addition to potentially greater risk, BITO has a significantly higher expense ratio. The median expense ratio for all ETFs is 0.50% while BITO's is at 0.95%. Note that ARKB and IBIT have expense ratios of just 0.21% and 0.25% respectively and so in comparison, BITO's expenses are rather high. This difference is likely due to the fact that derivatives need to be rolled over before expiration and so there is an aspect of active management in BITO. In short, BITO is a Bitcoin ETF that has higher standard deviation risk, has higher expenses, but provides a steady income stream in the form of dividend returns. Personally, I find that to be a poor value proposition but it is understandable that some investors prefer those kind of returns. Takeaway While the technical support and resistance levels are relatively balanced, the appearance of a double top could be ominous. In terms of momentum, it is clear that bullishness is weak and the RSI and stochastics indicators show that the bulls are starting to lose control of the ETF to the bears. Furthermore, the MACD and RSI confirm the double top with negative divergence and so there is a very real risk of downside from here. In terms of the fund itself, daily standard deviation is shown to be much higher than peers while expenses are also higher due to their derivatives strategy. BITO may appeal to income hunters but in my view, the ETF provides a poor fundamental proposition for investors looking for Bitcoin exposure.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4805920-bito-there-are-better-ways-to-play-bitcoin-technical-analysis?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"TRADING|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET","BITO",cryptocompare
2025-07-30T10:12:08,"The Most Searched Cryptocurrencies of the Last Days Have Been Revealed! ""Ethereum and These Five Altcoins Are at the Top!""","Tensions surrounding the Fed's interest rate decision have been building in Bitcoin and altcoins for the past few days. While the Fed is expected to leave interest rates unchanged barring any major surprises, Bitcoin and altcoins are experiencing pullbacks. At this point, while sudden fluctuations are experienced in BTC and altcoins, cryptocurrency analysis company Santiment said in its latest post that investors showed intense interest in six altcoins named Solana (SOL), Ethereum (ETH), Vine (VINE), Omni (OMNI), Tron (TRX) and Stellar (XLM) on social media. Solana: Key factors contributing to the escalation of discussions around SOL include ARK Invest’s significant staking activities, large purchases of SOL tokens, and involvement in DeFi and NFT projects. Regulatory developments such as the SEC postponing the Grayscale Solana Spot ETF decision to October 2025, ARK Invest and Invesco Galaxy applying for Solana ETFs, and comparisons with Ethereum and Base are drawing attention. Ethereum: ETH is trending for a variety of reasons. Reddit is buzzing about ETH scams, Telegram is buzzing about Ethereum, staking, DeFi, NFTs, Layer 2 solutions, and its rise to prominence as a leading smart contract platform driven by price action and ecosystem expansion, along with its growth in institutional adoption. Twitter is enthusiastically celebrating Ethereum's 10th anniversary. Vine: VINE is trending, with frequent mentions of short positions, scalping, and profit-taking signaling active speculation. This trend is driven by factors such as Elon Musk's tweets about Vine AI, significant whale buying, and the token's listing on trading platforms. VINE has seen an increase in price and trading volume, and upward momentum is noted, but caution is advised against potential short-term pullbacks. Omni: OMNI is trending due to significant trading activity and price action. OMNI's 1218% profits for some investors, a 117% increase on the ZEDXION exchange, and significant gains following its listing on Upbit are frequently mentioned. Tron: TRX is trending due to its significant role in stablecoin transactions, particularly USDT on the TRC20 network. Users are discussing Tron's market capitalization, its use for USDT trading in casinos, and its advantages like zero gas fees and fast transaction speeds. Additionally, Tron Inc.'s strategic move to establish a TRX-based crypto treasury, plans to raise $1 billion in securities, and growing institutional interest are contributing to its continued trend. Stellar: XLM is trending due to numerous discussions revolving around comparisons with other cryptocurrencies like XRP and concerns about technical analysis like golden crosses and support levels. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-30T10:12:01,"Bitcoin’s ‘Boring’ Phase Might End With a Big Bang—Here’s Why","TL;DR Bitcoin trades sideways between $116.8K and $119.5K, with liquidity swept on both ends. Michaël van de Poppe expects a stronger move the longer BTC remains rangebound. CryptoQuant data shows Bitcoin is in a neutral phase with no trend dominance yet. On-chain signals mirror 2020 patterns, hinting at a possible bull cycle end soon. Price Holds in Narrow Band Bitcoin (BTC) was priced at $118,300 at press time, down 0.2% over the week. For several weeks now, the asset has been moving in a tight zone without direction. Traders are showing caution ahead of today’s FOMC interest rate decision. Crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe described the current pattern as “extremely boring,” pointing to the lack of decision or momentum. Bitcoin has been holding between $116,800 and $119,500, with no clear move up or down. His chart shows that liquidity above and below this range has already been cleared. That often happens before a strong price move. He added that a break above $119,500 could open the way for a test of previous highs. If the price drops instead, the $110,000 to $112,000 range may become a key area to watch for buying. Extremely boring range for the past few weeks on #Bitcoin . Still no breakout, still no decision.

It currently stands at 44%. Notably, this number reflects several market signals, including selling activity from long-term holders, ETF inflows, and overall demand. A higher number means the market is heating up. A lower one suggests a quiet phase, often seen before prices rise.

While some profit-taking is beginning, it’s still at a controlled pace. Short-Term Cooling Continues Another CryptoQuant analyst, known as Crypto Dan, noted a small cooling period after a brief wave of short-term activity. They looked at the amount of Bitcoin held for just one day to one week and said the numbers showed signs of short-term heat earlier this month. Source: CryptoQuant Compared to the larger corrections seen in 2024 and early 2025, this phase appears smaller in both strength and length. The analyst also said the recent price increase was not large, which could limit how deep or long any correction might be. Crypto Dan suggested that traders may need to wait through this cooling period before seeing the next upward trend. Long-Term Wallet Activity Shows Familiar Pattern On-chain analyst Joao Wedson pointed out that the number of Bitcoin wallets holding more than 10,000 BTC is falling again—just like it did during the 2020–2021 bull market. During that time, the price kept rising even as large holders reduced their positions. “The same pattern is happening again,” Wedson said. He also mentioned that this may point to the final stretch of the current bull market cycle. “In my opinion, this signals that the BTC bull market has just a few weeks left.” he said This pattern is being watched closely, especially as the market continues to move within a narrow range.

2025-07-30T10:06:13,"Bitcoin’s $120K Rally in Jeopardy as Miners Flood Binance With $2B BTC","Bitcoin’s recent attempt to reclaim the $120,000 mark is facing new headwinds after Binance witnessed one of the largest single-day miner deposit spikes in months. According to a report by CryptoQuant analyst Amr Taha, on July 25, miners sent over 18,000 BTC, worth more than $2 billion, to the exchange. The move coincided with a $650 million USDC withdrawal event, raising concerns over short-term liquidity pressure despite an otherwise bullish market backdrop. Miner Behavior Flips The uptick in miner deposits marks a sharp shift from their previously cautious stance. As recently as June 29, CryptoQuant data showed miners were holding onto their reserves, despite declining revenues and a slight 3.5% drop in Bitcoin’s hashrate. Analysts attributed this “HODL” behavior to strong unrealized profits and expectations of further upside. However, Bitcoin’s July rally toward $120,000, just a few grand shy of its July 14 all-time high, appears to have triggered profit-taking. Taha suggested that rising operational costs and mining difficulty may also be compelling miners to liquidate some holdings to manage expenses. He stated that such large inflows to exchanges have historically preceded periods of consolidation, as selling pressure temporarily outweighs new demand: “While long-term sentiment remains bullish, this sharp inflow and capital movement may precede a period of consolidation or a local correction.” The expert also noted that Binance had recorded its largest USDC net outflow in more than two months, with $650 million exiting the platform on the same day as the BTC inflow. This stablecoin drain suggests that some traders could be shifting funds to cold storage or alternative venues, potentially reducing immediate buy-side liquidity on the exchange. Meanwhile, Binance has taken steps to adapt to shifting liquidity conditions. It recently launched Discount Buy, a feature allowing users to purchase crypto at below-market rates, potentially incentivizing accumulation during dips. Taha suggested in his analysis that the platform is once again “becoming a focal point for short-term supply and liquidity shifts.” Market Outlook At the time of this writing, BTC was trading at $117,981, down slightly by 0.7% over the past 24 hours and 0.6% over the past week, while holding an 8.8% monthly gain. The asset remains within a tight seven-day range of $115,184 to $119,568, perhaps indicating market indecision near key resistance. Despite the sell-off, Bitcoin’s long-term fundamentals remain strong. Miner reserves had been climbing since March, with addresses holding 100 to 1,000 BTC accumulating 65,000 BTC, their highest level since November 2024, per CryptoQuant. For now, traders are waiting to see if the flagship cryptocurrency can hold support above $115,000. If it does, analysts expect another attempt at breaking $120,000, potentially setting the stage for a retest of the all-time high.

2025-07-30T09:58:15,"AML Bitcoin founder gets 7 years for $10M crypto scam","A 47-year-old crypto CEO has been sentenced to seven years in prison for his role in a $10 million fraud scheme that misled victims using a fake cryptocurrency called AML Bitcoin. On Tuesday, Rowland Marcus Andrade, founder and CEO of the now-defunct AML Bitcoin project, received his sentence from Chief US District Judge Richard Seeborg in San Francisco. The court has also ordered a forfeiture hearing scheduled for September 16 to determine how much of Andrade’s assets will be returned to the victims. Federal prosecutors said Andrade ran a years-long scheme that falsely marketed AML Bitcoin as a cryptocurrency with built-in anti-money laundering technology. He told investors the coin featured advanced security features and claimed it would soon be adopted by major institutions, including the Panama Canal Authority. Investigators later found that no such technology existed, and the Panama Canal deal never materialised. What is AML Bitcoin? Andrade launched AML Bitcoin with promises that it complied with US regulatory standards and could track criminal activity, giving it an edge over other cryptocurrencies. These claims drew in millions from retail investors who believed they were backing a legitimate and innovative project. However, prosecutors said Andrade fabricated key details about the token’s capabilities and business partnerships to lure in victims. According to court documents, Andrade diverted more than $2 million in investor funds for personal use. He used the money to purchase two properties in Texas and luxury cars, while misleading patrons that the funds were being used for the development and promotion of AML Bitcoin. “The defendant made one false claim after another about a sophisticated cryptocurrency offering to create the illusion of a legitimate business,” said United States Attorney Craig H. Missakian, adding that Andrade “exploited numerous investors who put their trust in him, not knowing that their hard-earned money was in fact funding his lavish lifestyle.” Federal agents were able to trace the laundered money through multiple bank accounts tied to Andrade. Negotiating a 17-year sentence Jurors found Andrade guilty in March 2025 after a five-week trial that detailed how he misled investors and funnelled their money into personal luxuries. During sentencing, federal prosecutors urged the court to impose a 17.5-year prison term, arguing that the scale of Andrade’s deception and the financial harm to victims warranted a lengthy sentence. Andrade’s legal team, in contrast, asked for just two years in prison followed by supervised release, claiming he did not intend to cause harm and had cooperated with investigators. In the end, Chief Judge Richard Seeborg handed down a seven-year sentence followed by three years of supervised release under court-mandated conditions. Justice Department continues crackdown on crypto-related crimes The Department of Justice has ramped up enforcement actions against cryptocurrency-related fraud in recent months. Over the past week alone, the DOJ has pursued several high-profile forfeiture cases targeting digital assets lost to scams and frauds. In one case, the DOJ filed a civil complaint to recover over $7 million in crypto tied to a $97 million oil and gas investment scam. Separately, prosecutors moved to seize over 20 Bitcoin linked to a ransomware operator affiliated with a newly discovered ransomware group.
