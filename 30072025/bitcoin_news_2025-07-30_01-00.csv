2025-07-29T22:30:55,"Why TRON Latest $1B USDT Mint May Be Its Most Strategic Yet","Tron continues to dominate the stablecoin landscape, with another $1 billion in USDT minted just yesterday‚Äîbringing the total minted on the network in 2025 to a staggering $23 billion. This marks the strongest year for USDT supply expansion on Tron since the peak of the 2021 cycle. With this latest mint, the total USDT supply on Tron now stands at $81.7 billion, further solidifying its position as the leading blockchain for Tether issuance. Historically, large-scale USDT mints have been viewed as bullish signals for the broader crypto market. These events often precede periods of increased liquidity, signaling that traders and institutions are preparing fresh capital for strategic deployment. As USDT acts as a primary on-ramp into crypto markets, its expansion is closely watched as a proxy for incoming demand. The timing of this mint is especially important, coming as Bitcoin consolidates near all-time highs and altcoins show growing volatility. With capital ready on the sidelines, many analysts believe the market could be on the verge of another expansion phase. If history is any guide, Tron‚Äôs latest $1B mint may mark the beginning of a new wave of inflows across the digital asset ecosystem. Tron‚Äôs $1B USDT Mint Signals Bold Shift Toward Financial Integration Top analyst Darkfost suggests that Tron‚Äôs latest $1 billion USDT mint is unlike previous ones‚Äîand could mark a turning point for the ecosystem. Unlike standard mints, this $1B issuance has not yet appeared on-chain. According to the transaction hash, the funds were transferred to a multisig wallet, where they remain inactive, pending further authorization. No transaction fees were paid, a strong indicator that this is an inventory replenishment mint authorized by Tether but not yet put into circulation. For now, it doesn‚Äôt reflect in on-chain supply metrics, but the intent behind it carries deeper implications. What makes this mint especially significant is its timing. It comes just days after Tron.inc was listed on Nasdaq and shortly after Justin Sun confirmed the submission of an S-3 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). That filing includes the proposed issuance of hybrid securities totaling exactly $1 billion‚Äîthe same amount as the mint. These securities could take the form of common stock, preferred shares, or debt instruments. The overlap in timing and value suggests a coordinated strategy: Tron may be preparing to intertwine traditional financial instruments with stablecoins in a capital-efficient, compliant structure. If true, this would be a precedent-setting move for the crypto space, positioning Tron not just as a blockchain for transfers but as a fully integrated financial platform. This mint, though not yet live on-chain, may be the first step in a broader vision that bridges TradFi and DeFi‚Äîleveraging stablecoin liquidity as a tool for regulated fundraising and capital management. For Tron, this could be the most significant development since its inception. TRON Breaks Higher As Weekly Chart Signals Bullish Continuation TRX is showing strong bullish momentum on the weekly chart, currently trading at $0.3476 after gaining 8.66% in the last session. This move pushes TRX to its highest weekly close since early 2022, breaking past local resistance levels and approaching its cycle high. The price action reflects a well-structured uptrend that began in early 2023, supported by rising volume and a clear series of higher highs and higher lows. The 50-week SMA ($0.2330), 100-week SMA ($0.1735), and 200-week SMA ($0.1220) are all trending upward and now lie far below the current price‚Äîconfirming the strength and maturity of the trend. TRX remains firmly above all major support zones, with no immediate signs of exhaustion on the chart. If TRX sustains above the $0.32‚Äì$0.34 range, the next major resistance could come near $0.40. A clean weekly close above current levels would likely open the door to further upside in Q3, especially if broader market conditions remain favorable.

Five days ago, the US filed a civil complaint in the Northern District of Texas to claim over $2,400,000 in stolen Bitcoin ( BTC ) funds seized by the Dallas FBI earlier this year from a ransomware group known as ‚ÄòHors.‚Äô Says the DOJ, ‚ÄúAs alleged in the complaint, 20.2891382 BTC was seized from cryptocurrency address bc1q5d8af0crjhlnepjq08muhh55899rf2ktye3sxd on April 15, 2025. The seized cryptocurrency, now valued at over $2.4 million, allegedly constitutes property involved in unlawful activity, or proceeds of or property derived from unlawful activity, including money laundering and extortion related to damage to a protected computer, commonly referred to as a ransomware attack. The seized cryptocurrency was traced to a cryptocurrency address allegedly associated with a member of the Chaos ransomware group, known as ‚ÄòHors,‚Äô which has been tied to ransomware attacks against victims located in the Northern District of Texas and elsewhere. The complaint is filed under Case No. 3:25-CV-01920-K. Dallas FBI executed the cryptocurrency seizure.‚Äù The seizure lends credence to the proposed Strategic Bitcoin Reserve concept floated by the Trump Administration. Earlier this year, Executive Director of the Presidential Council of Advisors on Digital Assets Bo Hines said the US government was looking at various ways to accumulate more BTC. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre looking at many creative ways, whether it be from tariffs. Whether it be from something else.

In the last 12 months, ADA climbed 90%, leaving Bitcoin‚Äôs 70% gain behind. Related Reading: Countdown To August 15: What XRP Investors Need To Know He argues that this gap isn‚Äôt new‚Äîit‚Äôs been widening ever since Cardano switched hundreds of millions of dollars‚Äô worth of BTC into building its own network. Cardano Vs. Bitcoin Returns According to interviews with Blockworks co‚Äëfounder Jason Yanowitz, Cardano‚Äôs early backers traded yen contributions into 108,000 BTC. That stash would be worth about nearly $13 billion today if it had just sat there. Instead, those coins went straight into building Cardano‚Äôs network. Based on reports, ADA‚Äôs market cap now sits at $30 billion‚Äîabout 150% higher than the value of the Bitcoin reserve and roughly 2.8 times as much. Really enjoyed this conversation with @IOHK_Charles We covered a lot: politics, psychedelics, his bison + black hawk, his alien search, Japan‚Äôs influence on Cardano, personal security, and of course‚Ä¶ Why he believes ADA is a better investment than BTC.pic.twitter.com/rB26dLLVpP ‚Äî Yano üü™ (@JasonYanowitz) July 28, 2025 Since launch, ADA has jumped nearly 4,000% from its $0.02 debut in September 2017. Bitcoin has rallied 2,400% from a $4,337 price point in that same stretch. Many investors see those raw numbers and wonder whether they should have picked ADA over BTC from the start. They lay out a clear record of gains. Yet gains aren‚Äôt the full picture. Each network serves a different purpose. Bitcoin leans on being a store of value. Cardano mixes staking, smart contracts and on‚Äëchain governance. Future Growth Prospects Hoskinson isn‚Äôt stopping at history. He predicts Bitcoin could still make a 10√ó move to reach $1 million per coin. ADA, by his math, could expand 100√ó to 1,000√ó. That puts Cardano‚Äôs potential market cap in the $2.8 trillion to $28 trillion range. He points to projects like Midnight, which aims to bring data privacy to blockchains, and to Cardano‚Äôs role as a possible ‚ÄúDeFi layer‚Äù for Bitcoin. Those are the levers he says can drive the next big leg up. That vision carries plenty of risk. Blockchains often launch big ideas that take time‚Äîor never‚Äîfind their footing. And pushing ADA to a multitrillion‚Äëdollar valuation would demand major real‚Äëworld use, plus a flood of new users and developers. Even a 100√ó gain would redraw the charts, let alone 1,000√ó. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is A Lifeline, Says Billionaire, As US Faces Debt Time Bomb A Balanced Take ADA‚Äôs run has been impressive. It‚Äôs clear that building a living network, rather than simply holding coins, can pay off. But calling ADA ‚Äúsignificantly better‚Äù than BTC turns on much more than past returns. It hinges on successful rollouts, deep user engagement, and fresh use cases that catch fire. Whether Cardano will rewrite blockchain history remains to be seen. For now, investors can look at the numbers, weigh the risks, and decide if they want a piece of a project that bets on being more than just money.

2025-07-29T22:00:04,"BitMine Immersion Launches $1 Billion Stock Repurchase Program","BitMine Immersion Technologies, which has transitioned from Bitcoin (BTC) mining to focusing on Ethereum (ETH), is launching a stock buyback program. According to a press release , the company plans to buy back up to $1 billion of its outstanding common stock. BitMine Holds Over 600K Ethereum As of July 28, BitMine has 121,739,533 common shares available, and each share has a net asset value (NAV) of $22.76 based on its cash and crypto assets. Notably, the company can repurchase shares as needed through the market or private transactions, depending on market conditions and other factors. Meanwhile, BitMine‚Äôs buyback program is supported by its strong financial position. The company now owns 625,000 ETH, which is worth about $2.4 billion, and 192 BTC, valued at around $22.8 million. The program aims to reduce the number of shares available, which could lead to higher earnings per share (EPS) and better valuation. This decision is appealing to investors looking for value in the crypto sector. It shows that BitMine is committed to managing its capital wisely and strengthens trust in the company‚Äôs long-term vision. BitMine Immersion Aims for 5% Supply Control Recently, BitMine purchased over $2 billion worth of ETH within 16 days. Interestingly, this purchase made it the largest corporate holder of ETH among newly formed Ether treasury companies. Tom Lee, managing partner at FundStrat and chairman of the company, confirmed that the firm is ‚Äúwell on our way to achieving our goal of acquiring and staking 5% of the overall ETH supply.‚Äù With Ether‚Äôs current circulating supply, this target equates to almost 6 million ETH, valued at approximately $22 billion at current market prices. Furthermore, BitMine‚Äôs bold move signals a growing institutional appetite for Ethereum . It also mirrors Michael Saylor‚Äôs Bitcoin accumulation strategy, but on a larger scale, if the company‚Äôs ambitions are fulfilled. BitMine‚Äôs Long-Term Plan for Ethereum Leadership BitMine is not just mining cryptocurrency. It has a clear and long-term strategy. The company aims to establish one of the most extensive Ethereum holdings in the world by acquiring 5% of the total ETH supply. This goal gives the company a strong position and continues to attract institutional investors, such as Cathie Wood‚Äôs Ark Invest , as the market evolves. Other companies, such as Bit Digital and SharpLink Gaming, are also adding ETH to their balance sheets . Together, they are helping to change how Ethereum is seen, not just as a currency, but as a valuable asset for long-term growth.

2025-07-29T22:00:00,"CNBC Spotlights XRP: Hundreds of Millions Have Poured In","XRP is making waves once again, this time in the institutional investment world. In a recent CNBC segment shared by crypto commentator Xaif, the spotlight turned to XRP‚Äôs growing popularity among fund managers and investors. Sal Gilbertie, President and CEO of 2Cream Trading, revealed that a newly launched leveraged XRP derivatives fund has attracted ‚Äúhundreds of millions of dollars,‚Äù making it the most successful fund in the company‚Äôs 16-year history. Speaking with CNBC‚Äôs Dom Chiu, Gilbertie explained that while 2Cream Trading has traditionally focused on agricultural-based ETFs, the firm pivoted into crypto after witnessing the unmatched momentum behind XRP. ‚ÄúThey call it the XRP Army,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd I see why.‚Äù CNBC SPOTLIGHT ON $XRP ‚ÄúHundreds of MILLIONS have poured in ‚Äî our most successful fund ever.

According to Gilbertie, the product immediately took off, drawing an unprecedented level of investor demand. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve never seen a response like that,‚Äù he said, noting the scale and speed of capital inflows. While crypto ETFs have largely focused on Bitcoin and Ethereum, this fund marks a significant expansion into alternative digital assets. Gilbertie, an open XRP enthusiast, said the company had previously filed for a Bitcoin product but chose XRP derivatives for this initiative due to its strong use case and devoted community. ‚ÄúOur investors wanted leverage,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúWe delivered a vehicle that gives them access to XRP in a way that fits their strategy.‚Äù Institutional Interest and Market Confidence This development comes amid rising institutional confidence in XRP, even as regulatory uncertainties linger. Despite Ripple‚Äôs ongoing legal skirmishes with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the fund‚Äôs overwhelming success signals that many investors are betting on XRP‚Äôs long-term viability and real-world utility, particularly in global payments. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Gilbertie likened today‚Äôs crypto market to the early days of the internet. ‚ÄúThis is the internet in the 1990s,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúA sea change is coming.‚Äù Rather than trying to guess the ‚Äúnext big coin,‚Äù he urged investors to pay attention to how blockchain technology is transforming entire industries. A Defining Moment for XRP The CNBC feature could not have come at a more symbolic time, with a growing number of institutions pouring into XRP-focused financial products, the token is shedding its speculative reputation and stepping into a new role as a serious player in modern finance. Xaif‚Äôs viral post brought even more attention to the broadcast, celebrating the milestone as proof that XRP is ‚Äúnot just a coin, it‚Äôs a movement.‚Äù As regulatory clarity inches closer and financial innovation accelerates, XRP‚Äôs expanding footprint in the ETF world may just be the beginning of a much larger shift.
