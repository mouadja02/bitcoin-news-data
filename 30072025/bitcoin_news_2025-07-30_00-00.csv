Lubin argued that the future of Ethereum is now a reality rather than a dream. Lubin stated that ETH stands out as a ‚Äúproductive and yielding asset.‚Äù Discussing Sharlink Gaming's corporate treasury strategy, he explained that they accumulate ETH daily and immediately stake or re-stake it, thus capitalizing on the yield potential of decentralized finance. He added that this strategy aims to grow their ETH holdings faster than other Ethereum- or Bitcoin-based projects. Lubin stated that his companies don't currently use leverage but are considering offering convertible bonds, adding that they aim to maintain a low-risk profile. He expressed confidence that decentralization will grow dramatically over time, and he expects a significant increase in the value of ETH, Bitcoin, and other tokens. Related News: Company That Previously Announced It Would Purchase $200 Million Worth of This Altcoin Announces Additional $500 Million Purchase Comparing Bitcoin's adoption to ETH, Lubin explained that as currencies depreciate, Bitcoin's value proposition as a digital gold equivalent has become clearer. In contrast, he noted that Ethereum's future, which was ‚Äúright before us,‚Äù is now a reality, with financial institutions and businesses embracing the changing trust structure inherent in decentralized protocols. He described ETH as ‚Äúthe ultimate trust commodity‚Äù that will drive economic growth. Finally, Lubin shared his views on the SEC's digital asset policy, stating that he finds the SEC supportive of decentralized protocol technology despite the technicalities of its recent decisions. He also noted that the increased profitability of the Ethereum ecosystem stems from ETH becoming scalable, affordable, and legally usable in the United States. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-29T21:29:01,"Strategy raises $2.52 billion in its 2025 IPO to buy 21,021 BTC","Strategy, widely regarded as the leading Bitcoin Treasury Company, announced completion of an IPO that secured roughly $2.52‚ÄØbillion, which it promptly deployed to purchase 21,021‚ÄØbitcoins at a total outlay of about $2.46‚ÄØbillion. According to a press release shared by Business Wire the preferred shares, designated STRC, were priced at $90 apiece and are set to list on the Nasdaq Global Select Market around July‚ÄØ30 under the ticker ‚ÄúSTRC.‚Äù The firm sold 28,011,111‚ÄØshares of its Variable Rate Series‚ÄØA Perpetual Stretch Preferred Stock at $90 per share. This offering ranks as the top U.S. IPO of 2025 to date and stands among the most substantial crypto-related deals in recent memory. Trading for STRC should commence on July‚ÄØ30, 2025. Total capital raised was approximately $2.521‚ÄØbillion. After accounting for underwriting fees, commissions, and transaction expenses, net proceeds amounted to about $2.474‚ÄØbillion. Strategy allocated these funds to acquire 21,021‚ÄØbitcoins at an average of roughly $117,256 each. Strategy expands holdings to 628,791 BTC The move increased its aggregate bitcoin holdings to about 628,791‚ÄØcoins as of July‚ÄØ29, 2025, representing an overall investment of around $46.8‚ÄØbillion and an average cost basis of $73,227 per bitcoin, fees included. This transaction set several benchmarks. At $2.521‚ÄØbillion in gross proceeds, it is 2025‚Äôs leading U.S. IPO by proceeds and the most sizeable perpetual preferred stock issue in the U.S. since 2009. Once trading begins, STRC will become the first exchange‚Äëlisted perpetual preferred security from a Bitcoin Treasury Company to distribute monthly dividends under a board‚Äëdetermined rate policy. It also marks Strategy‚Äôs inaugural short‚Äëduration, income‚Äëoriented offering, broadening options for investors seeking steady income streams. Joint bookrunners on the deal were Morgan Stanley, Barclays, Moelis & Company, and TD‚ÄØSecurities. Co‚Äëmanagers included The Benchmark Company, Clear Street, AmeriVet Securities, Bancroft Capital, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, and‚ÄØMaxim Group LLC. Strategy‚Äôs STRC offers bond-like stability STRC acts like a short‚Äëterm bond while helping the company buy more Bitcoin. Each share pays a monthly dividend that adds up to about 9% per year, although the board can tweak that rate by a quarter‚Äëpercent up or down each month. To keep the share price near $100, the company sells new shares at $101 when demand is strong, pauses or pulls shares if prices dip below $99, and adjusts the dividend rate as needed. If the market worsens, shares can be sold back at $100; if it improves, the company can repurchase STRC to balance its finances, without issuing any extra common stock. Investors like the steady income and stability of STRC, especially compared with the dilution risk of a typical stock offering. Even with Bitcoin‚Äôs ups and downs, Strategy‚Äôs common shares stay above $406, and its other preferred shares trade around $111, $112, and $0.87.

2025-07-29T21:20:11,"SoFi Crypto: Unlocking a New Era of Digital Finance","BitcoinWorld SoFi Crypto: Unlocking a New Era of Digital Finance Are you ready for a significant shift in how you manage your digital assets? U.S. fintech giant SoFi is making waves with ambitious plans to dive deeper into the world of cryptocurrency. SoFi CEO Anthony Noto recently unveiled a comprehensive strategy to expand the company‚Äôs crypto offerings, signaling a bold move that could redefine the landscape of integrated financial services. This isn‚Äôt just about dabbling; it‚Äôs about building a robust ecosystem that includes staking, asset-backed borrowing, and even a proprietary stablecoin. For anyone interested in the evolving synergy between traditional finance and the burgeoning crypto market, SoFi‚Äôs latest venture represents a compelling development worth exploring. The company is not only relaunching its spot trading services by year-end but is also aggressively hiring talent to bolster its crypto division, demonstrating a serious commitment to becoming a major player in this dynamic space. This expansion aims to leverage SoFi‚Äôs unique position, particularly its banking license, to potentially launch a stablecoin under the promising framework of the GENIUS Act, as reported by The Block. This strategic push positions SoFi crypto at the forefront of financial innovation. What‚Äôs Driving SoFi Crypto‚Äôs Ambitious Expansion? SoFi‚Äôs foray into expanded crypto services is driven by a clear vision: to offer a comprehensive, all-in-one financial platform for its members. The company recognizes the growing demand for digital asset services and is positioning itself to meet this need with a suite of sophisticated offerings. Let‚Äôs break down the key components of this exciting expansion: Staking Opportunities: SoFi plans to introduce staking, enabling users to earn passive income by locking up their cryptocurrencies to support network operations and receive rewards. This feature provides a new avenue for long-term crypto holders to grow their portfolios and diversify income streams. Asset-Backed Borrowing: SoFi aims to offer asset-backed borrowing, allowing users to take out loans using their cryptocurrencies as collateral. This provides a flexible financial tool to access funds without selling valuable crypto holdings. Future Stablecoin Launch: Perhaps the most intriguing aspect is the development of SoFi‚Äôs own stablecoin, potentially under the GENIUS Act. This would provide a stable medium for transactions within its ecosystem, leveraging its banking license for regulatory compliance and trust, a critical differentiator in the often-volatile crypto market. Relaunch of Spot Trading: SoFi is set to relaunch its spot trading services by year-end, providing a robust platform for users to directly buy and sell cryptocurrencies. This foundational service is crucial for user adoption and engagement within the SoFi crypto ecosystem. The Strategic Edge: How SoFi‚Äôs Banking License Empowers SoFi Crypto One of SoFi‚Äôs most significant competitive advantages in the crypto space is its national banking charter. Unlike many fintechs or pure-play crypto exchanges, SoFi operates as a regulated bank, giving it a unique position in the evolving digital asset landscape. This isn‚Äôt just a regulatory formality; it‚Äôs a strategic asset that builds trust, reduces risk, and opens doors to services others can‚Äôt easily offer. Here‚Äôs why SoFi‚Äôs banking license is a game-changer for its SoFi crypto ambitions: Enhanced Trust and Security: As a regulated bank, SoFi adheres to stringent compliance and security standards, providing a level of trust and consumer protection that unregulated crypto platforms often struggle to match. Regulatory Clarity for Stablecoins: The potential to launch a stablecoin under the GENIUS Act is directly tied to SoFi‚Äôs banking status. This proposed legislation aims to provide a clear regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers, particularly for banks, reducing regulatory uncertainty and fostering wider adoption. Integrated Financial Services: A banking license allows SoFi to seamlessly integrate crypto services with its existing suite of traditional financial products, creating a holistic financial ecosystem where users can manage their entire financial life within one trusted platform. Access to Traditional Banking Infrastructure: SoFi‚Äôs banking status grants it direct access to traditional banking rails, facilitating smoother and more cost-effective fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-fiat conversions, which is critical for user convenience. Benefits for SoFi Users: A Holistic Financial Ecosystem with SoFi Crypto For SoFi members, this expansion isn‚Äôt just about new features; it‚Äôs about Unlocking a more comprehensive and integrated financial experience. The planned crypto offerings are designed to complement SoFi‚Äôs existing suite of services, creating a truly all-in-one platform for managing money, investing, and now, engaging with digital assets. Let‚Äôs explore the tangible benefits: Seamless Integration: Manage your checking account, invest in stocks, apply for a loan, and stake your crypto ‚Äì all from a single app. SoFi‚Äôs vision provides unparalleled convenience, simplifying financial management for the everyday user interested in SoFi crypto . Diversified Wealth Building: Staking offers a new avenue for passive income, diversifying wealth-building strategies. Asset-backed borrowing provides flexibility, allowing users to leverage crypto assets without selling them, providing liquidity when needed. Enhanced Trust and Security: Operating under a banking license, SoFi offers a level of regulatory oversight and security that many pure-play crypto platforms cannot, instilling greater confidence in users. Accessibility to Innovative Finance: SoFi‚Äôs move democratizes access to advanced crypto functionalities like staking and borrowing, making sophisticated crypto strategies accessible to a broader audience through a user-friendly platform. Navigating the Challenges in the SoFi Crypto Journey While SoFi‚Äôs crypto expansion presents immense opportunities, it‚Äôs crucial to acknowledge the challenges that lie ahead. The cryptocurrency market is dynamic, marked by rapid technological advancements, evolving regulatory landscapes, and intense competition. SoFi, despite its advantages, will need to skillfully navigate these complexities to ensure the long-term success of its SoFi crypto ventures. Key challenges include: Regulatory Uncertainty: Despite SoFi‚Äôs banking license, the U.S. regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies remains fragmented. New legislation or interpretations could impact SoFi‚Äôs plans, requiring continuous adaptation. Market Volatility: The inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies poses a risk for both SoFi and its users. Managing user expectations and providing robust risk management tools will be critical for services exposed to price fluctuations. Intense Competition: The crypto market is crowded. SoFi will need to differentiate itself effectively on user experience, competitive pricing, and the breadth and quality of its offerings against established exchanges and DeFi protocols. Technological Scalability and Security: Building and maintaining a secure, scalable, and reliable crypto infrastructure is a significant undertaking, requiring continuous investment in technology and cybersecurity to protect user assets. Actionable Insights: What This Means for Your SoFi Crypto Experience SoFi‚Äôs ambitious crypto expansion isn‚Äôt just corporate news; it has direct implications for how you might interact with digital assets in the future. Whether you‚Äôre an existing SoFi member or considering joining, understanding these insights can help you prepare for the evolving financial landscape. Stay Informed on Rollout Details: Keep a close eye on official announcements from SoFi regarding launch dates, supported cryptocurrencies for staking, and specific terms for borrowing. Evaluate Benefits Against Your Needs: Assess how these new services align with your financial goals. Always consider the terms, fees, and risks associated with each service before committing. Understand the Regulatory Context: While SoFi‚Äôs banking license offers advantages, stay aware of broader crypto regulations, as changes could affect service availability or terms. Prioritize Security and Education: Even with a regulated platform, personal security practices are paramount. Utilize strong passwords, two-factor authentication, and leverage SoFi‚Äôs educational resources to deepen your understanding of these new crypto products. SoFi‚Äôs move is a clear indicator that the convergence of traditional finance and cryptocurrency is accelerating. By offering these advanced services within a regulated banking framework, SoFi is not just expanding its product line; it‚Äôs shaping the future of integrated financial services. This strategic step could empower millions of users to engage with digital assets in a more secure, convenient, and comprehensive manner, truly Unlocking a new era of digital finance.

2025-07-29T21:10:10,"Bitcoin ETF Options: SEC‚Äôs Monumental Approval Unlocks New Market Potential","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin ETF Options: SEC‚Äôs Monumental Approval Unlocks New Market Potential The world of cryptocurrency is constantly evolving, and recent developments signal a growing maturity and acceptance within traditional finance. A monumental shift has just occurred, poised to reshape how institutional investors interact with digital assets. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially approved a substantial increase in the options position limit for BlackRock‚Äôs spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), IBIT. This move, which raises the limit from 25,000 to an astounding 250,000 contracts, is not just a procedural change; it‚Äôs a game-changer for the entire crypto ecosystem, particularly for the burgeoning market of Bitcoin ETF options . Understanding the Significance of the SEC‚Äôs Approval for Bitcoin ETF Options This recent approval, first highlighted by Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas via X, is more than just a number adjustment. It signifies a deeper integration of digital assets into established financial frameworks. To truly grasp its impact, let‚Äôs break down what this means: What is IBIT? BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT is one of the pioneering spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. It allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements without directly holding the cryptocurrency, offering a regulated and accessible investment vehicle. What are Options? Options contracts give traders the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) an underlying asset at a specified price (strike price) on or before a certain date. They are powerful tools for hedging, speculation, and income generation. The Position Limit Explained: A position limit restricts the maximum number of options contracts an individual or entity can hold on a specific underlying asset. Historically, such limits are set to prevent excessive concentration of market power and to maintain orderly markets. The previous limit of 25,000 contracts for IBIT options was relatively conservative, reflecting the nascent stage of crypto derivatives in a regulated environment. The New Limit: The tenfold increase to 250,000 contracts dramatically expands the capacity for large-scale participation. This signals the SEC‚Äôs growing comfort with the maturity and liquidity of the underlying Bitcoin market and the IBIT ETF itself. Why This Matters: Unlocking New Market Potential for Bitcoin ETF Options The implications of this increased limit are far-reaching, particularly for institutional players who operate with significant capital. This move is expected to: 1. Boost Liquidity and Market Depth With a higher position limit, more large investors can enter the Bitcoin ETF options market. This increased participation naturally leads to: Tighter Spreads: The difference between bid and ask prices will likely narrow, making trading more efficient and less costly. Greater Trading Volume: More participants mean more transactions, enhancing the overall vibrancy and depth of the market. Reduced Price Impact: Large orders will have less impact on the market price, allowing for smoother execution. For a market like IBIT, which has already seen significant inflows, this additional liquidity is crucial for its continued growth and stability. 2. Empower Institutional Investors with Enhanced Hedging Strategies Institutions, such as hedge funds, asset managers, and even corporations with Bitcoin exposure, rely heavily on derivatives for risk management. The expanded Bitcoin ETF options limit provides them with a more robust toolkit: Scalable Hedging: Large institutions can now hedge much larger spot Bitcoin or IBIT positions, protecting against potential downturns without needing to sell their underlying assets. Sophisticated Strategies: The increased capacity allows for the deployment of more complex options strategies, such as covered calls to generate income or protective puts to limit downside risk on a grander scale. Arbitrage Opportunities: As the options market matures, opportunities for arbitrage between the spot Bitcoin market, IBIT, and its options will become more attractive, further improving price discovery. 3. Validate Bitcoin as a Mature Asset Class The SEC‚Äôs decision sends a strong signal to the broader financial world: Bitcoin is not just a speculative asset but one that is increasingly being treated with the same regulatory seriousness as traditional commodities and equities. This incremental acceptance builds trust and confidence, potentially attracting even more conservative investors who have been hesitant to enter the crypto space due to perceived risks or regulatory uncertainties. 4. Pave the Way for Further Innovation and Product Development As the market for Bitcoin ETF options grows and demonstrates its robustness, it could encourage the development of new and more diverse crypto-related financial products. This might include: More Complex Derivatives: Futures on options, or structured products built around Bitcoin ETFs. Increased Competition: Other ETF providers might seek similar position limit increases or launch their own options products, leading to a more competitive and innovative landscape. Challenges and Considerations in the Evolving Landscape of Bitcoin ETF Options While the approval is overwhelmingly positive, it‚Äôs important to acknowledge potential challenges and considerations: Increased Volatility Risk: While options can hedge, they can also amplify gains and losses. More aggressive options trading could, in theory, contribute to increased volatility in IBIT, especially during periods of market stress. Regulatory Scrutiny: As the market grows, so too will regulatory oversight. The SEC and other bodies will likely continue to monitor trading activity closely to ensure market integrity and protect investors. Education and Understanding: Options trading is complex. As more participants enter the market, there‚Äôs a greater need for robust investor education to ensure participants fully understand the risks involved. Broader Market Impact: What‚Äôs Next for Crypto? This development is a strong indicator of a trend towards greater institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. It suggests that regulators are becoming more comfortable with the underlying technology and market infrastructure. We could see similar expansions for other spot Bitcoin ETFs, and potentially even for ETFs tracking other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, once their own spot ETFs are approved. The ability to use derivatives like Bitcoin ETF options is a crucial step in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset economy. Actionable Insights for Investors For individual investors, this news reinforces the long-term trend of institutional interest in Bitcoin. While direct options trading on IBIT might be for more sophisticated traders, understanding this development is key: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory changes and market developments in the crypto ETF space. Consider Long-Term Trends: Increased institutional access and liquidity generally bode well for the long-term stability and growth of an asset class. Risk Management: If you do consider trading options, ensure you have a thorough understanding of the strategies and associated risks. Start small and seek professional advice if needed. The Road Ahead: A Maturing Market The approval of a significantly higher options position limit for IBIT is a testament to the maturing landscape of Bitcoin as an asset class. It demonstrates a growing regulatory confidence and opens doors for sophisticated financial strategies that were previously unavailable at scale. This move will undoubtedly enhance the efficiency and appeal of the Bitcoin ETF options market, further cementing digital assets within the global financial system. In conclusion, the SEC‚Äôs decision to raise the IBIT options position limit is a landmark event. It‚Äôs a clear signal that Bitcoin, through its ETF vehicles, is evolving into a more accessible and sophisticated asset for institutional investors. This move promises enhanced liquidity, more robust hedging capabilities, and further validates Bitcoin‚Äôs place in the broader financial world, paving the way for a more integrated and dynamic future for digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What does the increased options position limit mean for BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT? The increase from 25,000 to 250,000 contracts means that individual or institutional investors can now hold ten times more options contracts on BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT Bitcoin ETF. This significantly expands the capacity for large-scale trading, hedging, and investment strategies within the Bitcoin ETF options market. 2. How does this approval impact institutional investors specifically? For institutional investors, this approval is crucial. It allows them to implement more scalable and sophisticated hedging strategies for their substantial Bitcoin or IBIT holdings. They can now manage risk more effectively, execute larger trades without significant market impact, and participate more deeply in the options market, bringing greater liquidity and depth. 3. Will this increase IBIT‚Äôs liquidity and trading volume? Yes, it is highly anticipated that this approval will significantly boost IBIT‚Äôs liquidity and trading volume. With a higher position limit, more large institutional players are likely to enter the Bitcoin ETF options market, leading to tighter bid-ask spreads and increased trading activity, making the market more efficient. 4. What are the potential risks associated with increased Bitcoin ETF options trading? While beneficial, increased options trading also carries risks. Options are leveraged instruments, meaning they can amplify both gains and losses. Higher trading volumes and larger positions could potentially contribute to increased volatility in the underlying IBIT ETF, especially during rapid market movements. It‚Äôs crucial for participants to understand these inherent risks. 5. How does this development compare to options trading in traditional financial markets? This development brings Bitcoin ETF options closer to the maturity and functionality seen in options markets for traditional assets like stocks or commodities. The increased limit signifies a regulatory comfort level that aligns more with established financial instruments, allowing for similar levels of institutional participation and complex strategy deployment. 6. What‚Äôs next for Bitcoin ETFs and other cryptocurrency derivatives? This approval sets a precedent and could pave the way for similar increases in options limits for other spot Bitcoin ETFs. It also signals a broader trend towards the mainstream acceptance and integration of cryptocurrency derivatives into traditional finance, potentially leading to more diverse crypto-related financial products and increased regulatory clarity for the entire sector.

2025-07-29T21:04:07,"Analyst Reveals Unusual Data on Bitcoin: ‚ÄúThe Last Time This Happened Was When the Price of BTC Rose from $65,000 to $100,000‚Äù","Cryptocurrency analyst Axel Adler has shared a striking analysis of Bitcoin's long-term investor behavior. According to Adler, a significant decline in long-term investor (LTH) supply began when the Bitcoin price reached $118,000. The analyst noted that a decrease of approximately 52,000 BTC has been seen so far, and interpreted this as a shift by long-term investors toward distribution rather than accumulation. Adler argues that this shift in balance replicates the long-term investor pattern seen when Bitcoin rose from $65,000 to $100,000 in the fall of 2024. According to the analyst, this distribution process will accelerate as the price rises, as it has in previous macro cycles. Related News: Warning on This Altcoin: Founder of Another Altcoin Says They Want to Take Over 51% of the Network Another notable element in Adler's assessment was volatility. Bitcoin's quarterly volatility has fallen to 70%. This rate is very close to the local low of 62% seen at $26,000 in September 2023. Adler stated that this low volatility is an indicator of large capital entering the market, making Bitcoin a ‚Äúslower‚Äù asset. The highest volatility seen this cycle was 143%, while in previous cycles, this rate had reached as high as 236%. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-29T21:00:08,"Signal That Sparked 100% Litecoin Rally In 2017 Has Been Triggered Again","Many cryptocurrencies have shown signs of strength over the past few weeks, but Litecoin has been relatively quiet. After climbing above $125 in mid-July, Litecoin began to fade, gradually declining to around $110. This price pullback, though not particularly dramatic, extended Litecoin‚Äôs months-long pattern of tight consolidation and hesitant movement. However, the recent reappearance of a new technical signal on the monthly chart could suggest that this quiet phase is the calm before a storm for Litecoin‚Äôs price action. Tony ‚ÄúThe Bull‚Äù Points To Familiar 2017 Trend According to crypto analyst Tony ‚ÄúThe Bull‚Äù Severino, Litecoin‚Äôs Average Directional Index (ADX) on the monthly candlestick timeframe has bounced on the 20 level once again. The reaction to this seemingly average threshold is important because more often than not, it has signaled the start of a powerful trend for Litecoin. Specifically, Severino pointed to similarities with the ADX signal that preceded Litecoin‚Äôs explosive rally from the $3.5 price level in 2017. As it stands, the Directional Indicator +DI (green line in the chart below) is beginning to lift off from its recent low and is showing signs of strength by bouncing off the ADX (purple line in the chart below), a behavior that mimics the early stages of the previous similar breakout. He notes that in contrast, when the ADX hovered below 20 for most of the 2020 cycle, Litecoin only managed a shallow and short-lived rally. The current re-emergence of trend strength, with the ADX and +DI both gaining ground, suggests something structurally different is forming now, and it could mirror the bullish setup from nearly eight years ago. Chart Pattern Shows Multi-Year Price Squeeze The Litecoin monthly candlestick chart adds another layer to the technical picture. As shown in the chart above, the price of Litecoin has been forming a long-term symmetrical triangle pattern, compressing between descending resistance and rising support since its all-time high in 2021. This wedge has tightened very quickly in recent months, and the price is now pressing near the upper trendline. When these chart patterns resolve after years of spiraling, they often lead to decisive moves. And when such price compression aligns with rising trend strength in the ADX indicator, as it now does, it becomes even more convincing. As such, this convergence of the technical signal alongside the chart pattern sets the stage for a possible repeat of the 2017 breakout conditions. If that historical comparison holds, Litecoin could be on the brink of a substantial upward move. Right now, the most important price level to break above is $130, as this would mean that Litecoin is finally breaking above the upper trendline of this symmetrical triangle pattern. At the time of writing, Litecoin is trading at $110 , down by 3.7% in the past 24 hours.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/litecoin-rally-in-2017-reappears/,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK|AIRDROP|XLM|LTC|CFX|FLOKI|MX|COMMODITY|ONDO|ENA|GALA","Litecoin|ADX Indicator|Average Directional Index|litecoin|litecoin news|Litecoin price|LTC|LTC news|LTC price|ltcusd|LTCUSDT|Multi-Year Price Squeeze|Tony ‚ÄúThe Bull‚Äù Severino",cryptocompare
2025-07-29T21:00:06,"This Indicator Has Perfectly Called Bitcoin Cycle Tops, Here‚Äôs What It‚Äôs Saying Now","Market expert Mark Moss has drawn the crypto community‚Äôs attention to an indicator that has perfectly nailed Bitcoin cycle tops. Based on this indicator, the expert revealed that the cycle top is unlikely to happen this year, as other analysts may have predicted. Pi Cycle Top Indicator Reveals Next Bitcoin Cycle Top In an X post, Moss stated that the indicator is predicting a Bitcoin cycle top in the first quarter of 2027, not at the end of this year. He made this comment while describing the Pi Cycle Top indicator as the ‚ÄúHoly Grail‚Äù of Bitcoin indicators. The expert noted that the indicator nailed the Bitcoin cycle tops in 2013, 2017, and 2021. Related Reading: Analyst Sounds Alarm For 50% Crash If Bitcoin Doesn‚Äôt Make A New ATH Soon Moss admitted that this latest cycle top prediction is hard to believe, as everyone is expecting Bitcoin to peak in the fourth quarter of this year. However, the Pi Cycle Top indicator suggests that the Bitcoin cycle top will occur in Q1 2027 and that the BTC price could reach $395,000 by then. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital also recently alluded to the Pi Cycle Top indicator, noting how it was hinting at a possible cycle extension. He also confirmed that the indicator predicts a Bitcoin cycle top will occur in Q1 2027, with the flagship crypto possibly reaching $400,000. The analyst noted that, based on previous cycles, the Bitcoin cycle top is expected to happen in the fourth quarter of this year. However, the recent BTC rallies have caused the Moving Averages (MA) to shift to higher prices. With these MAs shifting with every Bitcoin rally, Rekt Capital stated that it could take at least until mid-early 2026 before a Pi Cycle Top crossover occurs. However, the analyst advised that it is still important to be cautious about Q4 of this year and possibly develop an exit strategy in case the Bitcoin cycle peaks then. The BTC 4-Year Cycle Is Over In a recent podcast, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart and Bitwise Chief Investment Officer (CIO) Matt Hougan gave their opinions on whether the 4-year Bitcoin cycle is over. Seyffart stated that he expects the amplitude of these cycles to reduce as more institutional investors enter the BTC ecosystem. Related Reading: The Final Bitcoin Act: Here‚Äôs What To Expect As BTC Trends Sideways Based on his statement, a Bitcoin cycle top might not happen as many expect, as the analyst predicts there won‚Äôt be massive drawdowns again with the flagship crypto maturing. On the other hand, the Bitwise CIO opined that the 4-year cycle for BTC is over. He explained that the factors that drove this four-year cycle are now watered down. Meanwhile, there is a growing inflow into Bitcoin, which would continue to drive demand. In line with this, Hougan declared that 2026 will be an up year for Bitcoin. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $119,000, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

2025-07-29T20:58:39,"SEC Approves In-Kind Redemptions for All Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved the use of in-kind creation and redemption processes for all spot bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), marking a significant shift in the regulator‚Äôs approach to digital assets under its new leadership. The decision allows authorized participants‚Äîlarge institutional investors who facilitate ETF liquidity‚Äîto create and redeem ETF shares directly in BTC or ETH, rather than having to use cash. The mechanism is widely seen as more efficient and secure as it lets authorized participants to closely track investor demand and adjust ETF share supply in real time, without the need to convert assets back and forth into fiat currency. This marks the SEC‚Äôs first major crypto-friendly policy move since Paul Atkins was named chair of the agency earlier this year. Atkins, a former SEC commissioner known for his market-friendly views, has long advocated for a more open regulatory approach toward digital assets. ""‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a new day at the SEC,"" said Atkins in a press release. ""A key priority of my chairmanship is developing a fit-for-purpose regulatory framework for crypto asset markets,‚Äù he continued. ""I am pleased the Commission approved these orders permitting in-kind creations and redemptions for a host of crypto asset ETPs. Investors will benefit from these approvals, as they will make these products less costly and more efficient."" The shift comes after BlackRock filed a request in January to allow in-kind transactions for its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), and other issuers, including Fidelity and Ark Invest, quickly followed. Until now, all approved spot bitcoin ETFs‚Äîfirst greenlit by the SEC in January 2024 ‚Äîwere only allowed to operate with cash creations and redemptions. That requirement added operational complexity and was widely viewed as a barrier to efficiency for institutional market makers. The SEC also approved an increase in position limits for options trading on IBIT, a move that will allow traders to hold larger options positions tied to the fund. Position limits are regulatory caps that restrict the number of options contracts a trader or institution can control in a single security to prevent market manipulation or excessive risk. By raising these limits, the SEC is signaling greater comfort with the liquidity and maturity of the Bitcoin ETF market, and giving institutional investors more flexibility to hedge or express views on the fund‚Äôs performance. The changes could significantly increase institutional participation in both ETF groups by reducing friction for arbitrage and hedging strategies. The SEC‚Äôs decision underscores a growing willingness under Atkins‚Äô leadership to treat crypto assets within the same regulatory frameworks applied to traditional markets.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/29/sec-approves-in-kind-redemptions-for-all-spot-bitcoin-ethereum-etfs,"REGULATION|BTC|ETH|MARKET|BUSINESS","Markets|SEC|Bitcoin ETF|ether ETF|Breaking News|top news|News",cryptocompare
