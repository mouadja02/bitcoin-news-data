2025-05-30T12:54:14.000Z,"Bitcoin Protects from Inflation & Control, Lyn Alden and Michael Saylor Explain Why This is the Bitcoin Century at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference","At the Bitcoin 2025 Conference (on May 27-29, in Las Vegas), macro analyst Lyn Alden and Strategy’s Michael Saylor made one thing clear: $BTC isn’t just a speculative asset; it safeguards against global economic crisis and enhances financial strength. Alden declared $BTC as a viable solution to ease up US debt. Saylor urged the crowd to trade traditional assets for $BTC to fuel a monetary revolution. With Bitcoin positioned as a hedge against systemic collapse, now could be the best time to invest. In this context, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) has been making waves as an additional way to secure $BTC for under a cent. Bitcoin Is the Answer to the US Debt Crisis, Says Alden Alden took center stage at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference with a chart-packed approach. Her core argument? The US economy’s debt is spiraling out of control, and $BTC could be the answer to this problem. She showed that, despite unemployment being low, US government debt has risen 7% since 2017. She further mentioned that debt worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic, without having slowed down since. This signals a volatile fiscal era. According to Alden, conventional ways to fix the economy – like raising interest rates – only make matters worse. Instead of slowing things down, they’re making the government’s debt bill grow more rapidly. To support her argument, she highlighted a major shift that began after 2008: public debt started growing faster than private debt, breaking historical trends and fueling long-term inflationary pressure. In response to these woes, Alden views $BTC as an escape route for America’s fragile, debt-driven economy. She also emphasized how $BTC is the complete opposite of our current financial system. ‘Instead of ever increasing units that can’t even slow down, Bitcoin is absolute scarcity. And instead of opaqueness, it’s transparent,’ said Alden. ‘… For the next ten years, we’re going to be running very large fiscal deficits. So, the only way to protect yourself from that situation is to own the highest-quality scarce assets. Of course, the one we all like here is Bitcoin,’ she added. As TradFi pressure builds, Alden foresees $BTC as a stable and independent payment option for a much more positive financial future. Saylor Says to Ditch ‘Inferior’ TradFi Assets for $BTC Also at Bitcoin 2025, Saylor urged the crowd to abandon traditional assets – fiat, bonds, real estate, and equity – and convert them into $BTC. He went as far as to call these assets ‘inferior,’ arguing that $BTC is the only future-proof store of value. The reason behind his thought process is that Bitcoin is the only digital commodity. So, if you’re a public company, you need to capitalize on it. After all, it’s the first asset in history to continuously outperform the S&P Index daily. ‘Take your fiat currency, trade it for Bitcoin. Take your long-term capital and trade it for Bitcoin. Sell your bonds and trade [them] for Bitcoin. Sell your inferior equity, sell your inferior real estate property, buy Bitcoin,’ he boldly announced. Interestingly, he emphasized AI as a game-changing force in crypto, advising investors to use machine-learning tools to decode market trends and sharpen their $BTC strategies. This puts a spotlight on AI Agent cryptocurrencies like MIND of Pepe , a highly successful crypto project closing out an $11M+ presale tomorrow . Considering that Saylor has witnessed the benefits of $BTC firsthand, his Bitcoin advocacy isn’t surprising. At the conference, he revealed that $BTC rose from $10K to $100K while MicroStrategy held 2% of the circulating supply. As a result, the company secured a hefty $2.2B gain and unlocked $2.2T in returns for all other investors involved. Strategy now owns 3% of $BTC’s total supply. Win Free $BTC When Bitcoin Reaches $150K+ Alongside Alden and Saylor’s strong pro-Bitcoin stances, $BTCBULL stands out as one of the few crypto projects cheer-leading Bitcoin’s potential. BTC Bull Token is a meme coin that’s attracted significant investor attention as a low-cost entry point for $BTC exposure. That’s because it helps you to ride the momentum of Bitcoin’s long-term success – without having to break the bank. The project distributes free $BTC to its holders when the crypto king hits new price milestones ($150K and $200K). Plus, even more rewards are in store. You’ll also get a $BTCBULL token airdrop when $BTC reaches $250K, of which a generous 10% of the 21B token supply is earmarked. $BTC is currently valued at $105K , a ~6% drop since its $111K ATH last week. Nevertheless, BitMEX’s Arthur Hayes foresees it hitting $250K this year. His prediction suggests that $BTCBULL’s token rewards might be just around the corner. For airdrop eligibility, all you need to do is buy $BTCBULL (currently for just $0.00254) using Best Wallet , a top-ranked software wallet for trading on Ethereum, Base, and BSC. You can also save on gas fees by purchasing $BEST , the wallet’s native token. But it’s not just the $BTC airdrops driving the project’s popularity (as evidenced by its quick $6.6M presale raise). Its token burns also play a significant role. $BTCBULL’s token supply will decrease when $BTC reaches $125K, $175K, and $250K. Based on supply and demand, this will boost scarcity and likely boost $BTCBULL’s value. Everyone wants a piece of what’s trickiest to attain, after all. $BTCBULL’s 62% staking rewards also turn heads, offering high APY for passive gains when you lock up your coins. The APY rate is dynamic and bound to go down as more investors join. Still, you can unstake your tokens at any time if you’re no longer interested in the rewards and more interested in trading. When whales start stacking $BTCBULL, like an investor did two days ago when buying $31K worth of $BTCBULL , it’s a strong signal to get involved. Our $BTCBULL price prediction backs this up. Post-exchange listings, the coin might reach $0.006467, making now an opportune time to join the presale for a potential 154% ROI. $BTCBULL Is the Cheapest Gateway Into $BTC Alden and Saylor sent clear messages at Bitcoin 2025: $BTC isn’t just some risky bet but a safe haven amid financial uncertainty and economic turbulence. As the cheapest ticket into the Bitcoin revolution, $BTCBULL might be worth buying before it likely pops. Remember this isn’t financial advice. You should always DYOR and evaluate risks before making any investment decision. The crypto market is highly unpredictable.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/btc-protects-from-inflation-control-lyn-alden-bitcoin-2025/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Crypto News",cryptocompare

2025-05-30T12:50:57.000Z,"Fastex Unleashes Ambitious Expansion into US Crypto Market via Los Angeles","BitcoinWorld Fastex Unleashes Ambitious Expansion into US Crypto Market via Los Angeles Get ready, America! A major player from the global crypto scene is making its way stateside. Fastex, a prominent crypto exchange headquartered in the bustling financial hub of Dubai, has officially announced its strategic entry into the US crypto market . This isn’t just a soft launch; it’s a significant move marked by the opening of a brand-new office right in the heart of Los Angeles. This expansion signals Fastex’s intent to capture a share of the dynamic and ever-evolving American digital asset landscape. Fastex Enters the US Crypto Market: What Does This Mean? The move by Fastex into the United States is a bold step, highlighting the exchange’s global ambitions. While details are still emerging, the core plan involves providing spot trading services to customers across the U.S. This means users will be able to buy and sell cryptocurrencies directly at current market prices. The initial focus appears to be on established digital assets, alongside their own native token. Entering the US crypto market is a complex undertaking. It requires navigating a patchwork of state and federal regulations, obtaining necessary licenses, and establishing a robust operational presence. The choice of Los Angeles as the base of operations is strategic, positioning Fastex in a major economic and technological hub on the West Coast. What Spot Trading Services Will Fastex Offer in Los Angeles? According to initial reports, the Fastex platform will initially offer spot trading for several key assets: Bitcoin (BTC): The undisputed king of cryptocurrencies, offering high liquidity and broad market interest. Ethereum (ETH): The leading smart contract platform, crucial for DeFi, NFTs, and much more. Fasttoken (FTN): Fastex’s native ecosystem token, which likely offers users benefits within the Fastex ecosystem, such as trading fee discounts or access to special features. Offering Bitcoin Ethereum and their own token provides a solid foundation for their US operations. Spot trading is the most common way for individuals to interact with crypto, making it a logical starting point for a new crypto exchange US entry. Navigating the US Crypto Exchange Landscape The United States already has a crowded market of crypto exchanges, from major players like Coinbase and Kraken to smaller, specialized platforms. Fastex will need to differentiate itself to attract users. Key factors for success in this competitive environment include: Regulatory Compliance: Adhering strictly to U.S. regulations is paramount for long-term sustainability and user trust. User Experience: Providing an intuitive, reliable, and secure platform is essential. Competitive Fees: Offering attractive trading fees can draw in volume. Customer Support: Responsive and effective support is crucial, especially for new users. Asset Variety (Future): While starting with key assets, expanding the list over time will be important. Establishing a physical presence in Los Angeles could help Fastex build local relationships and better understand the specific needs of the American market. The Significance of Los Angeles for Fastex Why Los Angeles ? This city isn’t just a cultural capital; it’s a growing tech and finance hub. Its strategic location on the West Coast provides a gateway to the broader US market and is home to a significant population of potential crypto users and investors. Setting up an office here demonstrates a serious commitment to building a presence within the United States. The move to Los Angeles is more than just opening a door; it’s about planting roots in a key region for the US crypto market . It allows Fastex to be closer to its potential customer base and potentially recruit local talent familiar with the nuances of the American financial and technological landscape. What Are the Potential Benefits for US Users? The arrival of a new crypto exchange US option like Fastex could bring several benefits to American users: Increased Competition: More exchanges mean more choices and potentially better services and lower fees for consumers. New Platform Features: Fastex may offer unique features or a different user interface compared to existing platforms. Access to Fasttoken: Users interested in the Fastex ecosystem will have direct access to trade Fasttoken on a US-compliant platform. Global Perspective: As a Dubai-based exchange, Fastex brings an international perspective that could enrich the US market. While challenges exist in entering a regulated market, the potential upside for both Fastex and US users is considerable. The availability of key assets like Bitcoin Ethereum from a new provider adds more liquidity and options to the market. Challenges and the Road Ahead Entering the US crypto market is not without its hurdles. Regulatory clarity remains an ongoing process in the U.S., and compliance costs can be significant. Building brand recognition and trust in a market dominated by established players will also require substantial effort and investment from Fastex . The success of Fastex’s venture in Los Angeles will depend on their ability to effectively navigate these challenges, secure the necessary licenses across various states, and build a platform that meets the high expectations of American crypto traders. Offering reliable spot trading for assets like Bitcoin Ethereum is just the first step. In Conclusion: A New Chapter for Fastex and the US Market Fastex’s expansion into the United States, marked by the opening of its Los Angeles office, represents a significant development for the Dubai-based exchange and adds another dynamic player to the competitive US crypto market . By initially focusing on popular assets like Bitcoin Ethereum and offering spot trading services, Fastex is laying the groundwork for its American operations. While the journey ahead involves navigating regulatory complexities and building a user base, this move underscores the continued global growth of the cryptocurrency industry and the attractiveness of the U.S. market despite its regulatory challenges. Crypto enthusiasts in the U.S. now have another platform to potentially explore for their trading needs, bringing a touch of Dubai’s crypto ambition to the Californian coast.

2025-05-30T12:41:20.000Z,"Asset Entities: The First Publicly Traded Asset Management Bitcoin Treasury For $8 Per Share -- Strong Buy","Summary I'm initiating a Strong Buy rating on Asset Entities due to its massive $750M PIPE funding and transformative merger with Strive Asset Management. The company is evolving from a social media tech play into a diversified entity targeting distressed Bitcoin assets and undervalued biotech firms. Institutional investors are buying in at a 121% premium, signaling strong confidence; I expect a short-term upside to $12-13 as momentum builds. Volatility will remain high, but with the new funding secured, I see a compelling short-term opportunity for investors at the current $8 level. Investment Thesis Asset Entities ( ASST ) is a very volatile stock, trading at less than $8 last week, hitting $12 just a few days ago, and now hovering around $8.10 per share. Equally important, however, is that it's a stock with a lot of good news. I'm here to explain the risk-reward profile of Asset Entities and Strive Asset Management, which merged earlier this month. From where I'm standing, I think there's a lot more upside to this stock in the mid-term. Asset Entities is, according to their bio, \""a technology company [that] provides social media marketing and content delivery services across Discord, TikTok, and other social media platforms.\"" This means their revenue is pretty diversified, and they are expanding into a new area that I expect will bring substantial growth after the merger with Strive Asset Management, which is a subsidiary of Strive Enterprises, Inc. The reason is that these two are becoming a single entity that aims to be the first public Bitcoin Treasury Company. Below is the post on X from Strive Asset Management's CFO, Ben Pham, emphasizing just how big a deal this is. X Before this merger deal, Asset Entities was recognized as the first publicly traded company centered around Discord communities. It has a flagship product called the \""AE.360.DDM\"", which offers customers design, development, and management services for Discord servers. This kind of product caters to businesses, influencers, and educational communities, basically anyone looking to gain a heads-up on social media. Additionally, the company provides \""Ternary\"", a Stripe-verified CRM and payment platform. They offer these services on other platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and X, not just Discord. Their financials, however, aren't the prettiest. Their Q1'25 revenue was $170,749, a 36.8% increase from $124,841 in Q1 2024. Operating Expenses were $1.83 million, up 20.9% year-over-year. Management states this is driven by higher advertising, marketing, payroll, and administrative costs, which makes sense for such a small company trying to grow. The market already reacted pretty well to the merger when it happened back around May 7th, with the stock up 1,240% since then, which you can see clearly in the chart below of the stock against the S&P 500 over the past month. YChart But, this Tuesday the stock dropped almost 22%, and investors, seeing the volatility, are all wondering: Is this the time to buy the pullback or stay on the sidelines? So, I'm here to give my take, especially in light of the latest transitions underway, the main of which is the following: [Strive Asset Management and Asset Entities] announced the signing of a $750 million private investment in public equity ((PIPE)), with an additional $750 million in potential financing available upon the exercise of warrants, which could increase total potential proceeds to $1.5 billion . To put that into context, we're talking about a massive merger deal with the money coming from a group of private institutional investors. What this tells me is that there are some big-money players who are very confident in the future of the stock. Since this merger has taken another step in the right direction, securing a great amount of funds and directing those funds for growth, I will initiate my coverage of Asset Entities with a buy. What's the new deal? In early May, Strive Asset Management and Asset Entities Inc. announced their merger, causing the stock to skyrocket 1,320% over the past month, and today, May 28th, they secured $750 million in new funding. To put this in context, Asset Entities only made $633,000 in revenue for the whole of 2024. So, where's all this money coming from? Well, there's a group of investors operating through something called a Private Investment in Public Equity ((PIPE)). Now, think of a PIPE as a quick way for public companies to raise money from their private investors, and keep in mind these private investors aren't like you and me; they have millions to invest. In this case, these investors are buying Asset Entities' shares at $1.35 per share. That's good news for people like us, as it's 121% higher than what the stock was trading at before the merger announcement. What this tells me is that these investors have huge confidence in this new deal. On top of this, there's also the potential for another $750 million to come in if investors choose to exercise warrants. Now, these warrants are like options to buy more shares later, which would bring the total investment to $1.5 billion. If that happens, you should buckle your seatbelts. So why the need to raise all these funds? Strive Asset Management is planning on merging with Asset Entities Inc. to create a new kind of public company: one focused on a few new money-making ideas. The $750 million is set to fund the merged entity's new strategic plan, to buy distressed Bitcoin assets as well as scoop up any undervalued biotech firms. Matt Cole, CEO of Strive Asset, seems bullish, saying traditional Bitcoin investors rely mainly on price ratios like price-to-NAV. But he's looking to head in a new direction when it comes to valuing Bitcoin investments. These new methods are said to be based on fundamentals and smart acquisitions, not just tracking Bitcoin's price. Since the PIPE is injecting all this cash, the new entity has no debt; if it stumbles across a struggling bitcoin company, it can move in quickly. What this means for investors is that Asset Entities is essentially expanding its revenue stream. It's no longer just a social/digital media tech business, but now has a financial engineering play in crypto and special situations investing. Expect Volatility Since these new PIPE shares come from institutional players, they sweep in and buy shares at a discounted price, in this case $1.35 a share. This is a 121% premium to Asset Entities' pre-merger price, but there's a catch. These shares will be restricted at first and can't be sold by the investors straight away, there's going to be some kind of lockup period on the shares, although we don't know exactly how long this is. In my opinion and historically, this lock-up period on the shares should be at least 3 months. So we can expect some stock volatility in that period but an overall upward trend. My reasoning for this is simple: the stock is up 1,335% over the past month, there's huge momentum here, and I expect it to keep going off the back of the new funds secured. On top of this, yesterday we saw a 21% drop in the stock price, which, I believe, is due to investors not fully understanding what this deal means for Asset Management. Also, I know what you're thinking: can those institutional investors sell off their shares immediately after that lock-up period is over? Well, the answer is, they can. However, they have at least a 3-month period in which they're bullish on the stock going up, so why can we jump on that train too? This also works as a short-term investment for me with a big upside. A Rollercoaster Ride This May So, a month ago, this was just a penny stock, trading at $0.63, and has since hit a high of $13 per share. The good news of the merger got well priced into the stock, and then between May 9th and May 14th, things calmed down with the stock dropping 40%. I think investors started reaping profits and selling off their shares. At this point, the stock started facing resistance around $5; investors knew there was something more here. At this point, only the news of the merger was out, and the funds for buying Bitcoin had not yet been secured. Despite the sell-off on May 9th, the stock pulled through, skyrocketing another 176%, hitting a high of $13 last Thursday. I'm bullish because the stock has fallen off 40% since that high, and you can pick up shares for $8. What makes me particularly bullish is this new bit of news I've just explained: they've secured the funding. I don't think investors fully understand what this PIPE investment does for Asset Entities. What it does is show huge confidence in their new entity to buy Bitcoin and make a huge upside. In the short term, I expect the stock to shoot up and recover to that $12-13 range it was before. Valuation The market cap is at $129 million, there's been a 52-week low of $0.34 and a high of $13, which goes to show you really how volatile this stock is right now. Because Asset Entities is expanding into Bitcoin and other revenue streams, it is hard to place them among competitors. Seeking Alpha compares them to peers such as Cardlytics Inc. ( CDLX ) and Marchex Inc. (MCHX), both advertising and analytics tech companies. These would be accurate peers before this merger, but now Asset Entities finds itself in a new ballgame. The RSI right now is at 53, and on its way down fast. This is the time to buy for investors, in my opinion. I think the $8 range is a good entry point for those looking to make a quick upside on the stock. What's Next Investors should be following the stock daily; we should see an upside this week from the news that funds have been raised for the new merger, and the stock is already showing signs, up 13% on Thursday so far. Those institutional investors are bullish, and so am I. Over the next few months, keep a lookout for any news on Asset Entities acquiring small biotech firms and any big Bitcoin investments. These will eventually be the new catalysts going forward.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4791176-asset-entities-1st-asset-management-public-bitcoin-treasury-for-8-per-share?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","ASST",cryptocompare
2025-05-30T12:40:59.000Z,"Expert Predicts Timeline for XRP to Disappear from Exchanges","The XRP community is closely monitoring recent forecasts suggesting a potential XRP supply shortage on cryptocurrency exchanges. According to Edoardo Farina, founder of Alpha Lions Academy and a prominent XRP advocate, this shift could greatly reduce the availability of XRP for public trading with a definite timeline. XRP’s Recent Price Movement Triggers Supply Concerns XRP has struggled to maintain its upward momentum following its surge to $3.30 in mid-January 2025. Since reaching that peak, the asset has been trading largely within the lower $2 range, showing limited signs of recovery. This stagnant performance has caused concern among holders, especially as Bitcoin and other leading assets continue to achieve new all-time highs. Despite this, Farina believes XRP is still capable of a significant rally. In a recent post, he emphasized that a major driver of this potential rise could be a supply shock, a situation where the number of available tokens on exchanges becomes insufficient to meet demand. Farina Projects Supply Shock by 2030 Farina has proposed that a substantial drop in XRP availability on exchanges could occur by 2030. He argues that this supply limitation would make it increasingly difficult for investors to acquire the asset, potentially fueling a price surge. According to him, the foundation for this future scenario is already forming. $XRP might DISAPPEAR from exchanges by 2030. Screenshot this. — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) May 28, 2025 Decline in XRP Reserves on Binance Supporting this outlook, data from the on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant reveals a consistent decline in XRP reserves on Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges. Since the beginning of 2025, the number of XRP held on Binance has fallen from 2.939 billion to 2.857 billion, a reduction of 82 million tokens. While this change may appear marginal in percentage terms, it signals a downward trend in the availability of XRP on centralized platforms. Crypto analyst EgyHash highlighted this movement in a prior analysis, noting that reserves had reached their lowest levels since July 2024. The decline was particularly sharp following XRP’s rise to $3.30 in mid-January. Binance reserves peaked at 3.040 billion tokens on January 16, coinciding with XRP’s local high. This likely resulted from investors transferring their assets to exchanges to take profits. Since then, the reserve has decreased by over 180 million tokens, fluctuating throughout February and March. Comparisons to Bitcoin’s Supply Dynamics Farina and other analysts have compared XRP’s evolving supply trend to Bitcoin’s historical performance. In BTC’s case, consistent buying pressure from institutions and ETFs has significantly reduced its available float, contributing to recent price increases. A similar effect could occur with XRP if exchange reserves continue to decline. Additionally, the ongoing token burn from transaction fees may further reduce the circulating supply, compounding the potential for a future shortage. Despite recent price stagnation, some analysts maintain a bullish outlook. Sistine Research previously projected a price range of $33 to $50 for XRP, citing favourable long-term trends and reduced market supply. If Farina’s forecast materializes and a supply shock occurs, the resulting scarcity may significantly impact XRP’s valuation over the next few years.

2025-05-30T12:30:02.000Z,"Ethereum Daily Gas Usage Hits New Highs – Real Demand Powers ETH Growth","Ethereum is experiencing increased volatility as it consolidates just below the key $2,700 resistance level. Despite several attempts to break above it in recent weeks, ETH has yet to secure a daily close above this threshold, making it a crucial battleground for bulls and bears alike. The broader market remains uncertain, but Ethereum’s fundamentals continue to show strength beneath the surface. Related Reading: Ethereum Tests Key Weekly Resistance – Analyst Sets $4K Target If ETH Breaks Out Top analyst Ted Pillows shared compelling insights on X, highlighting that Ethereum’s daily gas usage has been climbing steadily since 2016. This long-term rise suggests that Ethereum’s network activity is not just driven by short-term speculation or hype, but by real and growing demand. It’s a sign that users, developers, and applications are increasingly relying on ETH as the backbone of Web3 infrastructure. Ethereum’s ability to maintain this level of on-chain usage through bear and bull markets reinforces its role as the foundation of decentralized finance, NFTs, and smart contracts. While short-term price action remains capped below $2,700, the underlying demand tells a bullish story. If ETH can break above this level with conviction, it may signal the beginning of a broader move to retest higher resistance levels. Ethereum Fundamentals Are Strong As It Prepares For A Move Ethereum is facing a critical test as it consolidates below major resistance, struggling to reclaim key levels above the $2,700 mark. Bulls have maintained strong support over the past few sessions, but momentum has yet to trigger a breakout. As global tensions remain high and US Treasury yields continue to rise, risk assets—including cryptocurrencies—are under pressure. However, Ethereum appears poised for an expansive move, with technical and on-chain data supporting a potential breakout. Pillows highlighted that Ethereum’s daily gas usage has continued to climb steadily since 2016, reinforcing the view that ETH demand is structural and not just a product of market hype. This metric serves as a proxy for real activity on the Ethereum network, suggesting that despite short-term price hurdles, usage and value creation persist. Pillows believes this persistent demand positions ETH for a strong recovery once key technical levels are breached. Sentiment across the broader crypto space is gradually shifting bullish, especially with Bitcoin hovering near its all-time high. If Ethereum can reclaim and close above the $2,700–$2,800 resistance zone, it could open the door for a sharp rally toward $3,000 and beyond. Related Reading: Ethereum Spot Premium Signals Strength – $2,800 Resistance In Focus ETH Consolidates Below Key Resistance Ethereum is currently trading at $2,617, consolidating just below the critical $2,700–$2,800 resistance zone. This area has acted as a major barrier since early February, and despite several breakout attempts, ETH has failed to close above it with strong conviction. The chart shows a clear bullish structure, with the price holding above key moving averages: the 34 EMA at $2,366, and the 50, 100, and 200 SMAs all trending upward and providing layered support between $2,070 and $2,690. The recent consolidation comes after a strong rally in May that pushed ETH above its 200-day SMA for the first time in months, signaling a major shift in momentum. However, volume has started to taper off slightly, which could indicate hesitation from bulls at current levels. A decisive daily close above $2,800 would likely confirm the breakout and open the door for a move toward the $3,000–$3,200 range. Related Reading: Altseason Loading? Analyst Explains How FTX $5B Distribution May Trigger The Next Bull Leg Until then, the price remains range-bound, with $2,550 acting as near-term support.

According to Willy Woo’s update, the good news is that the Risk Signal is trending downwards. This usually points to strong buy-side liquidity in the market, meaning that, overall, investors are still eager to buy and hold Bitcoin. Woo says this sets the stage for another solid, long-term run higher. In the short term my main concern are the late comer speculators taking long positions while an immense amount of potential profit taking is ready to dump (SOPR). This week's spot buying will strongly influence the next 1-2 months of price action. We are in a pivot zone. pic.twitter.com/JVJfxVXcKU — Willy Woo (@woonomic) May 28, 2025 However, Woo also sees early warning signs. He says that the strength of Bitcoin’s surge from $75,000 to $112,000 is starting to weaken. Without a new wave of buying, Bitcoin could be in for another period of sideways trading. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin risk Signal chart also shows local risk levels ticking up, signaling that some traders are taking on more risk, just as profit-takers might be ready to sell. $106k: “Healthy Pause” for Bitcoin Supporting Woo’s cautious view, Nick Forster, founder of the on-chain options platform Derive, describes Bitcoin’s current state as a “healthy pause” after its big run. He explains that the market needs time to digest recent gains and prepare for the next phase. Forster noted that this consolidation is a sign of stability, not a reason to panic. He further added that this consolidation is a sign of stability, not a reason for panic. Bitcoin ETF Outflows Impact Price Meanwhile, Bitcoin ETFs saw record inflows for two straight weeks. But on May 29, a large outflow of $346.9 million occurred, led by BlackRock with $166.3 million, followed by Ark Investment and Fidelity. This outflow caused Bitcoin’s spot price to dip, falling by 2.6% in the last 24 hours, currently trading at $105,390.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoins-106k-run-about-to-pause-on-chain-experts-warn-of-key-signals/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","News",cryptocompare

As per our Ethereum price prediction 2040, Ethereum could reach a maximum price of $123,678. How much will the ETH coin price be in 2050? By 2050, a single Ethereum price could go as high as $255,282.

2025-05-30T12:20:03.000Z,"Stacks Ecosystem Funding: Ambitious SIP-031 Proposal Seeks STX Endowment","BitcoinWorld Stacks Ecosystem Funding: Ambitious SIP-031 Proposal Seeks STX Endowment The Stacks ecosystem, a pioneering layer-2 solution bringing smart contracts and decentralized applications to Bitcoin, is buzzing with discussion following a significant new proposal. Aimed squarely at supercharging development and adoption, this initiative could reshape how resources are allocated within the network. Let’s dive into the details of the Stacks Ecosystem Funding proposal, known as SIP-031, and what it means for the future of Bitcoin Layer-2. What is the Stacks SIP-031 Proposal? Published on May 27th on the Stacks forum, SIP-031 is a comprehensive plan designed to create a dedicated STX ecosystem endowment. Think of it as a centralized fund specifically purposed to fuel growth, innovation, and infrastructure within the Stacks network. The proposal outlines a multi-pronged approach to building this treasury, primarily through transfers from existing entities within the ecosystem and, notably, through a temporary adjustment to the network’s token economics. How Will the Crypto Endowment Be Funded? Understanding STX Token Emissions The proposed endowment wouldn’t appear out of thin air. SIP-031 details two primary funding mechanisms: Transfers from Existing Entities: This involves consolidating resources currently held by various foundations or groups associated with the Stacks ecosystem into the new endowment. Increased STX Token Emissions: This is perhaps the most discussed aspect. The proposal calls for a temporary increase in the annual issuance of STX tokens over the next five years. Currently, the annual STX emission rate is around 3.52%. SIP-031 suggests raising this average rate to approximately 5.75% for this defined period. It’s crucial to understand that this is proposed as a temporary measure to quickly capitalize the endowment, with emissions expected to return to baseline levels thereafter. This adjustment to STX Token Emissions is central to the plan’s ambition. This strategic increase in token emissions is designed to provide the endowment with substantial capital upfront, enabling it to make significant investments in the ecosystem’s future. Why is This Stacks Ecosystem Funding Initiative Necessary? Addressing Key Challenges The proposal doesn’t just appear randomly; it’s a direct response to identified challenges hindering the Stacks ecosystem’s full potential. The authors of SIP-031 highlight several critical issues: Underfunding Relative to Competitors: Despite its unique position as a Bitcoin layer, Stacks has faced challenges in securing comparable levels of funding and resources seen in other layer-1 or layer-2 ecosystems. This limits its ability to compete effectively for talent and projects. Operational Fragmentation: Resources and initiatives are currently spread across various entities, leading to potential inefficiencies and lack of coordinated effort. A consolidated endowment aims to streamline this. Limited Access to Growth Tools: Developers and projects within Stacks sometimes lack access to the sophisticated tools, grants, and support structures available in better-funded ecosystems. Insufficient Resources for Developers: Attracting and retaining top-tier developers requires competitive grants, bounties, and infrastructure support, areas where the ecosystem needs strengthening. By creating a robust Stacks Ecosystem Funding mechanism, the proposal seeks to directly tackle these hurdles, providing the necessary capital and structure to accelerate development. What are the Potential Benefits for Bitcoin Layer-2 Growth? A well-funded and strategically managed endowment could unlock significant potential for Stacks and, by extension, contribute substantially to overall Bitcoin Layer-2 Growth . The benefits could include: Faster Development Cycles: Increased funding can support core protocol development, tooling, and infrastructure improvements at a much quicker pace. Attracting Top Talent: Competitive grants and bounties can incentivize developers and researchers to build on Stacks. Supporting Key Projects: The endowment can provide crucial funding for promising dApps, DeFi protocols, and NFT platforms building on Stacks. Enhanced Marketing and Adoption Efforts: Resources can be allocated to educational initiatives, marketing campaigns, and partnerships to drive user adoption. Improved Ecosystem Coordination: A central fund can help align various ecosystem participants towards common goals. Ultimately, the success of this endowment could solidify Stacks’ position as a leading platform for innovation on Bitcoin. What Happens Next with the Stacks SIP-031 Proposal? Proposals in decentralized ecosystems like Stacks follow a specific process to ensure community consensus. For Stacks SIP-031 , the next steps are clearly defined: Community Feedback: The proposal is currently open for discussion on the Stacks forum, allowing anyone in the community to provide input, raise concerns, and suggest modifications. This feedback phase is crucial for refining the proposal. Committee Setup: A dedicated committee will likely be formed to review the feedback, potentially revise the proposal, and prepare it for a formal vote. Voting: The final decision rests with the STX token holders, who will vote on whether to approve or reject the proposal. The outcome of this vote will determine if the STX ecosystem endowment becomes a reality. This community-driven process ensures that significant changes like adjusting STX Token Emissions and establishing a large Crypto Endowment are made with the broad support of the network’s participants. Considering the Implications: Risks and Rewards While the potential benefits for Bitcoin Layer-2 Growth are substantial, it’s also important to consider potential downsides. The temporary increase in STX Token Emissions , for instance, could lead to short-term inflationary pressure, although the long-term benefits of a well-funded ecosystem are argued to outweigh this. Governance of the endowment will also be critical to ensure funds are allocated transparently and effectively for the benefit of the entire Stacks community. The success of this Stacks Ecosystem Funding initiative hinges on careful planning, transparent execution, and continued community oversight. Summary: A Bold Step for Stacks The SIP-031 proposal represents a bold and ambitious plan to address critical funding and coordination challenges within the Stacks ecosystem. By proposing the creation of a significant Crypto Endowment , funded in part through a temporary adjustment to STX Token Emissions and consolidation of existing resources, Stacks aims to accelerate Bitcoin Layer-2 Growth and development. The path forward involves crucial community discussion and ultimately, a vote by STX holders on the future of Stacks Ecosystem Funding . This process highlights the decentralized nature of the network and the importance of community participation in shaping its destiny.

2025-05-30T12:19:07.000Z,"JUST IN!  New Development in US-China Tariff Agreement: Trump Made a Statement! Bitcoin (BTC) and Altcoins Dropped!","US President Donald Trump said in a statement on his Truth Social account that China has violated its agreement with the United States. “Two weeks ago China was in serious economic danger! The very high Tariffs I imposed have made it nearly impossible for China to TRADE into the United States market, which is by far the number one market in the World. I made a QUICK DEAL with China to save them from what I thought would be a very bad situation and I didn't want that to happen. Thanks to this agreement, everything quickly stabilized and China returned to business as usual. Everyone was happy! This is the good news!!! The bad news, perhaps unsurprising to some, is that China has COMPLETELY VIOLATED THEIR AGREEMENT WITH US. That's the price of being Mr. Nice Guy.” Following the news, Bitcoin (BTC) fell to $ 105,100. Along with Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH) and altcoins also fell. Following the news, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told CNBC that they are focused on monitoring China's compliance, or in this case non-compliance, with the agreement. Greer also said China's behavior was “completely unacceptable” and that the U.S. was “very concerned” about China's non-compliance on trade. Greer said that there are daily talks with the Indian Trade Minister on trade agreements, and added that he will hold talks with Malaysia, Vietnam and the EU at the OECD next week. “China is moving slowly to lift some retaliatory tariffs. Tariffs can expand if necessary,” Greer said. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: JUST IN! New Development in US-China Tariff Agreement: Trump Made a Statement!

2025-05-30T12:10:54.000Z,"Bitcoin ETFs See First Joint Outflow in Weeks as Market Dips","U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a net outflow of $347 million on May 29, marking the first collective day of redemptions in over two weeks. According to data from CoinGlass, this broke a 10-day inflow streak across all 11 ETFs , with the last similar pullback occurring on May 13. This outflow also marks the largest single-day capital flight since March 11, when investors pulled $396 million from the funds. The sharp outflow followed a drop in Bitcoin’s price, which fell over 3.5% during the day. The world’s largest cryptocurrency slid from an intraday high of $108,850 to briefly dip below the $105,000 mark. The pullback in price appears to have triggered significant selling activity, especially among institutional ETF holders. Fidelity and Grayscale Lead the Exodus The Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) bore the brunt of the outflows, losing $166 million in a single day. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) followed with a $107.5 million outflow. Other notable exits included funds managed by Bitwise, Ark 21Shares, Invesco, Franklin Templeton, and VanEck. Meanwhile, CoinShares, WisdomTree, and Grayscale’s mini Bitcoin trust reported no flows for the day. Despite the general downtrend, BlackRock’s IBIT continued to attract capital , recording $125 million in net inflows. The fund has now notched up 34 consecutive days of inflows, having last seen a redemption on April 9. Over the past two weeks alone, IBIT has brought in nearly $4 billion, pushing its total net inflows to $49 billion and assets under management beyond the $70 billion mark. Ethereum ETFs Attract Capital Amid Bitcoin Outflows Interestingly, spot Ethereum ETFs defied the bearish trend affecting Bitcoin products. On the same day, they collectively logged $92 million in net inflows, extending their own 10-day inflow streak. The last day of outflows for these funds was May 15. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) was once again the front-runner, bringing in just over $50 million in new capital. The fund has now accumulated $4.5 billion in inflows since its launch in July 2024. Commenting on the broader outlook, ETF Store President Nate Geraci highlighted a significant capital rotation, noting that while more than $9 billion has flowed into spot Bitcoin ETFs in the past five weeks, gold ETFs have lost nearly $3 billion in the same timeframe. He also pointed to recent SEC clarity on staking, calling it a major step forward for Ethereum ETF products.

2025-05-30T12:10:07.000Z,"Sudden Reversal: US Spot Bitcoin ETFs See $347 Million Outflows","BitcoinWorld Sudden Reversal: US Spot Bitcoin ETFs See $347 Million Outflows Just when it seemed like the positive momentum was unstoppable, the trend for US spot Bitcoin ETFs took a sharp turn. After enjoying an impressive run of 11 consecutive trading days with net inflows, these popular investment vehicles experienced a significant shift on May 29th, recording substantial Bitcoin ETF outflows . This sudden reversal has naturally sparked discussions across the crypto market , prompting investors and analysts alike to assess the potential implications for the Bitcoin price and the broader landscape of institutional investment in digital assets. What Happened with US Spot Bitcoin ETFs on May 29? According to data shared by market observer Trader T (@thepfund) on X, May 29th saw a combined net outflow of $347 million from US spot Bitcoin ETFs . This figure represents a clear break from the recent streak of positive inflows that had characterized the market for nearly two weeks. The outflows were spread across several prominent funds, indicating a broad, albeit uneven, movement of capital out of these products. Here’s a breakdown of the funds that saw net outflows: Fidelity’s FBTC: $166.32 million Grayscale’s GBTC: $107.53 million ARK Invest’s ARKB: $89.22 million Bitwise’s BITB: $70.85 million Invesco’s BTCO: $20.05 million VanEck’s HODL: $11.98 million Franklin Templeton’s EZBC: $6.13 million Cumulatively, these seven ETFs accounted for the vast majority of the day’s net negative flow. Who Bucked the Trend Amidst the Bitcoin ETF Outflows? In contrast to the widespread outflows, only one of the actively trading US spot Bitcoin ETFs managed to attract net inflows on May 29th. BlackRock’s IBIT, often a strong performer in terms of inflows, recorded a net positive flow of $125.22 million for the day. This highlights that while there was a general movement towards exiting positions, some funds continued to see buying interest. Other ETFs in the market reported no changes in their holdings, meaning they experienced neither significant inflows nor outflows on that particular day. Understanding the Impact on Bitcoin Price and the Crypto Market Net flows into or out of US spot Bitcoin ETFs are closely watched metrics by investors and analysts. These flows are often seen as a proxy for the level of institutional investment and broader investor sentiment towards Bitcoin. Significant outflows can sometimes exert downward pressure on the Bitcoin price , as ETF issuers may need to sell underlying Bitcoin to meet redemptions. While a single day of outflows, even a substantial one like $347 million, doesn’t necessarily signal a long-term reversal, it does serve as a reminder of the volatility inherent in the crypto market . The recent 11-day inflow streak had contributed to positive sentiment and potentially supported Bitcoin’s price rally towards the $70,000 mark. A sudden outflow event can temper that enthusiasm and lead to price consolidation or a minor pullback. Potential reasons for the outflows could include: Profit-Taking: After a period of positive price action, some investors might be taking profits on their ETF holdings. Market Rotation: Capital might be rotating into other assets or sectors, either within crypto or traditional finance. Macroeconomic Factors: Shifts in global economic outlook, interest rate expectations, or other macro news could influence investor risk appetite. Specific Fund Dynamics: Outflows from a fund like GBTC can sometimes be related to its specific structure or investor base dynamics. The event underscores the interconnectedness between traditional financial products like ETFs and the underlying digital asset market. Monitoring these flows provides valuable insight into the ebb and flow of institutional investment . Why Did Institutional Investment See a Pullback? The primary investors in US spot Bitcoin ETFs are often considered to be institutional players and sophisticated retail investors seeking regulated exposure to Bitcoin. The sudden shift from consistent inflows to significant outflows suggests a collective decision by a portion of this investor base to reduce their exposure. While the exact motivations are multifaceted and difficult to pinpoint definitively for every investor, the overall trend indicates a temporary pause or reversal in the recent bullish sentiment among some institutional participants. It’s crucial to remember that institutional investment isn’t monolithic; different firms and individuals have varying strategies, time horizons, and risk tolerances. Understanding the drivers behind these shifts is key to navigating the crypto market . While ETFs offer a regulated pathway for institutional investment , they also tie the performance and flows of Bitcoin more closely to traditional financial market dynamics and sentiment. Key Takeaways from the Outflow Event This recent development offers several important insights for anyone interested in US spot Bitcoin ETFs and the broader crypto market : Volatility Remains: Even with increasing institutional adoption, the market for Bitcoin and related products remains volatile and subject to rapid sentiment shifts. Flows are Crucial: ETF flow data provides a real-time pulse on institutional interest and can influence short-term price action. Not a Unanimous Trend: While many funds saw outflows, BlackRock’s IBIT continued to attract inflows, showing varied strategies among investors. Context is King: A single day’s data point should be viewed in the context of longer-term trends and broader market conditions. For investors, monitoring these flows alongside other fundamental and technical indicators is essential for making informed decisions regarding their exposure to Bitcoin and the crypto market . Conclusion: Navigating the Dynamic World of Bitcoin ETFs The $347 million in net outflows from US spot Bitcoin ETFs on May 29th marked a notable pause in the recent positive momentum. This event, ending an 11-day streak of inflows, highlights the dynamic nature of the market and the factors influencing institutional investment . While several funds experienced significant Bitcoin ETF outflows , BlackRock’s IBIT managed to attract inflows, showcasing varied investor behavior. This shift serves as a reminder that the path for the Bitcoin price and the overall crypto market is rarely a straight line, and staying informed about these key indicators is vital for navigating the landscape effectively.

2025-05-30T12:07:20.000Z,"BTC to $120K? Analysts say MUTM hits $5 as capital rotates into DeFi","With Bitcoin (BTC) setting sights on the $120,000 mark in this bullish cycle, crypto analysts are looking beyond the blue-chip rally to the next wave of opportunity. The current sentiment mirrors the 2020–2021 bull run, when Bitcoin (BTC)’s price surge acted as the trigger for a massive influx of capital into decentralized finance. Just as BTC reached new highs back then, DeFi tokens followed with exponential gains. This time, a new generation of DeFi projects is poised to benefit, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is at the front of the pack. Analysts have started naming Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the next breakout token with a direct path to $5, citing its strong fundamentals, real product, and early pricing advantage. The project is designed to thrive as capital rotates from major assets like Bitcoin (BTC) into smaller, high-upside DeFi protocols. Why capital moves from BTC to DeFi Historically, Bitcoin (BTC) leads every crypto bull run. As it breaks into new all-time highs, early investors begin to rotate their profits into altcoins with lower market caps and higher growth potential. In the 2020 cycle, various projects saw explosive gains as users shifted focus to earning passive income and participating in decentralized finance. Once Bitcoin (BTC) momentum stabilizes, attention turns to utility-driven projects with scalable income models. This is where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioned perfectly. Its protocol offers real returns through decentralized lending, appealing to both yield-seeking investors and early adopters of high-performing tokens. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is built for the next DeFi wave Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized, non-custodial lending and borrowing platform where users can earn passive income or borrow against their assets. The system uses smart contracts to allow secure lending in both peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-contract (P2C) formats. It supports a broad range of digital assets including Ethereum (ETH), stablecoins like DAI, and even memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE)—tokens that traditional platforms ignore. The protocol’s smart lending design adjusts interest rates based on real-time market demand, which ensures consistent earnings for liquidity providers. When users deposit assets like DAI into the protocol, they receive mtTokens, which grow in value as interest accrues. In active pools, this passive income can reach double-digit annual returns depending on utilization levels. This practical income model is a major reason analysts are forecasting a steep climb in value for MUTM as the market turns its attention back to DeFi. At its current price of $0.03, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in its Phase 5 presale, with over $9.45 million raised and 11,650+ holders already onboard. Early adopters from Phase 1 saw entries near $0.01, meaning they’ve already tripled their investment. As the next price phases unlock, later participants will face reduced upside. Buying now at $0.03 offers a rare position. An investment of $2,000 secures 66,666 MUTM tokens. Once the token reaches $5, the value of that investment becomes $333,330. Those who wait risk entering at a higher price and earning a fraction of the return. The most significant gains always go to the earliest participants. As one analyst put it, “The people celebrating at $5 are the ones who had the conviction at $0.03.” Security, real product, and passive income: the winning trio Unlike many low-cap tokens, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t vaporware. It’s a real protocol backed by an audit from CertiK, which scored the token with a 70.00 in its security review. The audit included both static code analysis and manual inspection, and helps build trust for users providing capital to the pools. More importantly, the project is not just preparing for a future product—it is actively building. The team plans to release the beta version of the platform by the time MUTM is live on exchanges. This timing aligns perfectly with the expected rotation of capital from BTC profits into working DeFi products. Passive income is no longer a luxury in the crypto world; it’s a strategy. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enables users to lend DAI or ETH and earn yield without giving up custody of their funds. This kind of product-market fit matters in a maturing ecosystem where security, usability, and earnings define long-term winners. As BTC climbs toward $120,000, large and mid-sized crypto investors will begin looking for undervalued, functional projects with high upside. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already on their radar. With a current market cap that remains a fraction of even the smaller DeFi platforms, MUTM offers the asymmetric upside that smart traders chase after every Bitcoin (BTC) peak. The early numbers already prove the interest is growing. With nearly $9.5 million raised and a community expanding daily, momentum is clearly building ahead of the token’s exchange debut. Add in the ongoing $100,000 giveaway campaign, and it’s clear that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is doing more than just building tech—it’s building community, liquidity, and attention. Final word Smart money always rotates from secure blue-chip assets like Bitcoin (BTC) into the next opportunity. In 2020, it was DeFi. In 2025, it’s DeFi again—but better. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just following that path; it’s paving a better one. Those who catch this wave early are the ones who win big. Waiting until MUTM is trading at $0.20 or $0.50 means the profit curve has already begun to flatten. The $0.03 price tag won’t last long, and the $5 target is no longer just a dream—it’s a logical destination.

2025-05-30T12:01:27.000Z,"Best Meme Coins to Buy During the Market Crash: Is This a Correction or Worse?","The crypto market is once again living up to its volatile reputation. With Bitcoin recently tumbling from its lofty $106K perch and a sea of red washing over most altcoins in the last 24 hours, ‘crypto crashing’ is a trending search term, and for good reason. Investors are understandably on edge, asking the crucial question: Is this a temporary blip, a correction after a strong run, or are we staring down the barrel of a more significant downturn? Navigating the turbulent waters can be daunting. However, periods of market fear can also present unique, albeit high-risk, opportunities. For the daring investor, the meme coin sector, known for its explosive potential (and equally dramatic nosedives), might be of interest. Some traders will be eyeing specific meme coins, wondering if the current dip offers a discounted entry point. If this dip is just a market correction, the real question becomes: which meme coins are built to survive the storm and thrive when the skies clear? From seasoned tokens with staying power to buzzy newcomers making serious noise, the hunt is on for meme coins that can hold their ground and deliver when the rebound hits. And don’t sleep on the best presales either. Projects like Snorter Token ($SNORT) and BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) are revving up for launch with real momentum, and could reward early believers with serious upside. In a market like this, timing is everything, and catching the next breakout project before the crowd does could make all the difference. 1. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Sniff, Snipe, Succeed. Master Meme Coin Trading In Telegram. If you’re tired of missing out on the next big meme coin, Snorter Token ($SNORT) is your new secret weapon. Helping you navigate crypto-trading from the convenience of your Telegram app, $SNORT will help you sniff out those early, under-the-radar gems before they hit the mainstream.

By combining intelligent discovery tools with a powerful trading bot and token holder benefits, $SNORT has the chops to level the playing field and potentially come in strong despite the recent market red. 2. Cat in a Dog’s World ($MEW) – Solana’s Feline Fury, Challenging the Meme Coin Pack. Some investors see red as a challenge to find the coins that fight back. Enter Cat In a Dog’s World ($MEW) , the feisty alternative to the crowded dog-themed crypto market. Built on the high-speed, low-fee Solana blockchain, $MEW isn’t just another cute face in the meme coin crowd. It embodies a rebellious spirit, playfully ready to claw its way into the territory dominated by the likes of Dogecoin. This feline fury is all about carving a unique niche, backed by a rapidly growing community captivated by its disruption and the technical advantages of its Solana foundation. You can buy $MEW for $0.003362 on Kraken . Coins like $MEW, with distinct branding and passionate followings ( 137K+ followers on X , and 25K+ subscribers on Telegram ), offer resilience, and its clear underdog (or rather undercat) appeal, could make it an intriguing addition for those looking for high-potential plays during market uncertainty. 3. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Bitcoin Rewards & Token Burns. Multiply Your Bull Run. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is an innovative way to align with $BTC’s potential long-term success. This isn’t just another meme coin. It directly rewards its holders with actual $BTC as the flagship crypto achieves key price milestones. Hold your $BTCBULL in Best Wallet (one of the leading non-custodial crypto wallets) to receive your rewards. Furthermore, $BTCBULL incorporates a strategic token burn mechanism, reducing its supply as $BTC climbs, thereby enhancing scarcity and value for its community. While the current market might be red, savvy investors understand that volatility is part and parcel of crypto. Many adopt longer-term perspectives, focusing on foundational assets. $BTC in particular continues to see positive signals in the evolving regulatory discussion, cementing itself as a cornerstone of the digital asset space that isn’t going anywhere. You can snap up $BTCBULL for $0.00254 with 63% staking rewards. We see $BTCBULL going the distance and predict it will reach $0.06467 by the end of 2025, a 2446.06% increase on today’s presale price. For those who believe in $BTC’s enduring trajectory, $BTCBULL offers a unique proposition: a chance to not only ride the wave of the eventual bull run but potentially multiply those gains through its distinct rewards. 4. Just a Chill Guy ($CHILL) – No Hype, No Stress. Just Good Vibes on The Blockchain. Okay, yes, the market is generally red at the moment, but take a leaf from the playbook of Just a Chill Guy ($CHILL) and relax. $CHILL isn’t about chasing fleeting pumps or navigating complexity; it’s cultivated around the simple ethos of providing a relaxed, community-centric space in the often frenetic meme coin universe. The core idea is to build a token where the community can keep calm, fostering a sense of stability and shared patience. The market red can be taxing, but this is where a project like $CHILL might find its unique appeal. It’s a coin that offers a different kind of value, one centred around a low-pressure vibe. If you’re looking for a project less frantic about speculation and more about shared long-term beliefs in a simple concept and its collective, the $CHILL philosophy could be your proposition. $CHILL is available for $0.07465 on decentralized exchanges. In times of uncertainty, the strength of a calm, committed community can be a strong signal, suggesting that sometimes the most chill approach is the one that endures. Red Sea Opportunities: Investing Wisely When Markets Dip A market downturn can reveal unique opportunities for investors. While creating uncertainty, projects in the meme coin sector, like the utility-focused $SNORT or the $BTC rewarding $BTCBULL , aim to offer distinct propositions, even in challenging times. At any time, but even more so in the red, always do your own research and invest only what you can afford to lose.",newsbtc,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/best-meme-coins-to-buy-during-the-market-crash/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING","Cryptocurrency Market News|Meme coins",cryptocompare

Announced via Alchemy Pay ‘s official Medium blog, the collaboration means that users no longer need to navigate potentially complex cryptocurrency exchanges or peer-to-peer platforms to acquire USD1 stablecoin . Instead, they can leverage Alchemy Pay ‘s extensive network of supported payment methods to directly purchase USD1 using their preferred fiat currency. For those new to the space, a ‘ crypto on-ramp ‘ is essentially a service that allows individuals to convert their traditional fiat money (like USD, EUR, GBP, etc.) into cryptocurrency. Think of it as the bridge between the traditional financial system and the crypto world. Making this bridge as smooth and accessible as possible is crucial for increasing user adoption and liquidity within specific crypto ecosystems like WLFI ‘s. By integrating Alchemy Pay ‘s capabilities, WLFI is significantly lowering the barrier to entry for potential users of its USD1 stablecoin and associated DeFi services. This is particularly important for a project seeking wider reach and participation. Why is Seamless Crypto On-Ramp Access Important for USD1 Stablecoin ? Stablecoins like USD1 stablecoin are designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. They serve multiple purposes within the crypto landscape, including: Store of Value: Offering stability compared to volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Medium of Exchange: Facilitating quick and low-cost transfers globally. DeFi Participation: Acting as essential building blocks for lending, borrowing, and yield farming protocols within decentralized finance platforms. However, accessing stablecoins often requires users to first buy a major cryptocurrency (like BTC or ETH) on an exchange and then trade it for the stablecoin. This multi-step process can be intimidating and cumbersome for newcomers. A direct crypto on-ramp solution, powered by a reputable payment gateway like Alchemy Pay , streamlines this process into potentially just a few clicks, making it far more user-friendly. For WLFI ‘s USD1 stablecoin , enhanced accessibility via a direct on-ramp means: Increased liquidity for USD1 . Easier participation in any DeFi protocols or services offered by WLFI that utilize USD1 . A broader potential user base, including those less familiar with traditional crypto exchanges. How Does Alchemy Pay ‘s Payment Gateway Facilitate This? Alchemy Pay operates a comprehensive payment gateway that connects fiat and crypto economies. Its infrastructure supports a wide array of global and local payment methods, making it a versatile tool for businesses and projects looking to integrate crypto payments or on/off-ramps. Key features of Alchemy Pay ‘s payment gateway that benefit the WLFI partnership include: Extensive Payment Method Support: Acceptance of major credit and debit cards (Visa, Mastercard), various bank transfer options, and numerous local payment channels specific to different regions. Global Coverage: Ability to process transactions from users in many countries, expanding the potential reach for WLFI ‘s USD1 stablecoin . Compliance and Security: Handling necessary regulatory compliance and security measures for processing fiat-to-crypto transactions. Ease of Integration: Providing tools and APIs that allow partners like WLFI to seamlessly embed the on-ramp service directly into their platforms or websites. This technical capability is what underpins the ‘seamless access’ touted in the announcement. Users interacting with WLFI ‘s platform (or wherever the integration is live) can now initiate a purchase of USD1 stablecoin and complete the transaction using familiar fiat payment methods, all powered by Alchemy Pay ‘s backend. Exploring the WLFI Project and USD1 Stablecoin World Liberty Financial ( WLFI ) is positioned as a DeFi project. While the original announcement highlights its link to the Trump family, the core focus from a technical perspective is its offering, specifically the USD1 stablecoin . Understanding WLFI ‘s broader goals and the intended use cases for USD1 stablecoin provides context for why a seamless crypto on-ramp is a critical piece of infrastructure for them. Typically, DeFi projects aim to recreate traditional financial services (like lending, borrowing, trading) using blockchain technology, often utilizing stablecoins as the primary medium of value exchange due to their price stability. For WLFI , the USD1 stablecoin likely serves as the native stable asset within its specific DeFi ecosystem or planned applications. Making it easy for users to acquire USD1 directly with fiat is essential for driving activity and participation within that ecosystem. The partnership with Alchemy Pay suggests WLFI is prioritizing user accessibility and aiming to onboard users who may be new to DeFi or crypto but are interested in the specific offerings or community around WLFI . Benefits of the Partnership: A Closer Look Let’s break down the tangible benefits this collaboration brings: For WLFI : Access to Alchemy Pay ‘s global payment gateway network instantly expands the potential user base for USD1 stablecoin . It removes technical hurdles for onboarding new users who hold fiat, increasing liquidity and potentially driving adoption of other WLFI services. It positions WLFI as a more accessible DeFi project. For USD1 Stablecoin Users: The primary benefit is convenience. Users can now purchase USD1 stablecoin directly using their local fiat payment methods without needing to use separate exchanges or complex crypto wallets initially. This simplifies the process significantly, saving time and potentially reducing fees associated with multiple transactions. For the Broader Crypto Ecosystem: Partnerships like this contribute to the overall goal of making cryptocurrency and DeFi more accessible to a mainstream audience. By providing user-friendly on-ramps for specific assets like USD1 stablecoin , they help bridge the gap between traditional finance and the decentralized world. Actionable Insight: How to Use the New On-Ramp While specific steps may vary slightly depending on where WLFI integrates the service, the general process for users wishing to purchase USD1 stablecoin via the Alchemy Pay payment gateway would typically involve: Visiting the official WLFI platform or a service that has integrated the Alchemy Pay on-ramp. Locating the option to ‘Buy USD1 ‘ or ‘Add Funds’. Selecting Alchemy Pay as the payment provider. Choosing their preferred fiat currency and the amount of USD1 they wish to purchase. Selecting a supported payment method (e.g., Visa, Mastercard, bank transfer). Completing the required payment and verification steps through Alchemy Pay ‘s secure interface. Receiving the purchased USD1 stablecoin directly into their connected crypto wallet. This streamlined flow is designed to mimic familiar online purchase experiences, reducing friction for users entering the crypto space. The Road Ahead for Alchemy Pay and WLFI This partnership is a clear indication of both Alchemy Pay ‘s continued strategy to expand its payment gateway services across various crypto projects and WLFI ‘s effort to enhance the accessibility of its USD1 stablecoin . As the DeFi space evolves, seamless on-ramps will remain a critical component for attracting and retaining users. The success of this integration will likely be measured by the ease of use reported by users and the increase in accessibility and liquidity for the USD1 stablecoin within the WLFI ecosystem. Partnerships like this highlight the ongoing effort within the crypto industry to build user-friendly infrastructure that connects the traditional financial world with the innovative possibilities of blockchain and DeFi. Conclusion: Bridging Fiat and USD1 Stablecoin with Ease The strategic partnership between Alchemy Pay and WLFI is a significant development for anyone interested in accessing the USD1 stablecoin . By integrating Alchemy Pay ‘s versatile payment gateway , WLFI has effectively created a seamless crypto on-ramp , allowing users to purchase USD1 stablecoin directly using a wide range of fiat payment methods. This move not only enhances the accessibility of USD1 but also contributes to lowering the barrier to entry for the WLFI DeFi ecosystem. As the crypto landscape matures, collaborations focused on improving the user experience, particularly at the fiat-to-crypto conversion point, are essential for driving wider adoption. This partnership is a prime example of such an effort, promising a more convenient path for users to acquire USD1 stablecoin and engage with the WLFI project.

Economists expect a soft PCE print, potentially boosting Bitcoin and other risk assets. A high PCE reading (0.3%+ monthly core) could trigger crypto price drops and volatility. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis is scheduled to release its key inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, tonight, putting the crypto market on watch for potential turbulence, which is a critical indicator for the Federal Reserve.

Wynn, known for placing billion-dollar bets on the onchain trading platform Hyperliquid, opened a new 10x leveraged long worth more than $12 million on the memecoin PEPE, Hyperdash data shows. Wynn now holds 934 million PEPE tokens valued at approximately $12.1 million. His entry price of $0.0129 has already netted him an unrealized gain of 10.66%—a small but notable pivot after last week’s disastrous Bitcoin trade. Wynn’s bitcoin losses are the stuff of crypto legend. Earlier in the week, he had built a record-setting $1.25 billion notional long position at an average price of $108,243, only to see it collapse as bitcoin’s dipped below $105,000 after U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff announcement on EU exports. Multiple liquidations — including a 527 BTC position worth over $55 million and a 421 BTC position worth nearly $44 million — wiped out more than $100 million of Wynn’s holdings over the past days. As such, the latest move into PEPE has got traders wondering if Wynn is a real person with a gambling addiction — or an account funded to drum up attention to Hyperliquid. Either way, the money is real and the week-long saga has proven Hyperliquid’s capability to handle billions of dollars in a single trader wholly using smart contracts and its native blockchain. The hype has turned out real for Hyperliquid’s own HYPE, with the token up 20% in the past two weeks amid the recent attention to the platform.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/30/james-wynn-goes-long-on-pepe-hours-after-losing-100m-on-leveraged-bitcoin-bet,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|PEPE","Markets|Pepe|Bitcoin|Leveraged Trading|News",cryptocompare

Starting from May 30 at 10:30 UTC, traders can now take advantage of up to 75x leverage on HYPE, the native token of Hyperliquid. However, despite this exciting launch, HYPE’s price has surprised many by dropping 4.5% in the past 24 hours instead of going up. Binance Futures Lists HYPE According to the Binance announcement , the HYPE/USDT perpetual contract went live on May 30 at 10:30 UTC. This new contract is designed to give traders more flexibility and high-leverage opportunities. Binance has set a maximum funding rate of +2.00% or -2.00% at launch, and funding fees are settled every four hours. Binance also mentioned that they may adjust these numbers in the future based on market risks, so traders need to stay alert. This new contract will also be available for Futures Copy Trading within a day, making it easier for newcomers to follow top traders. But Why No Price Pump? Despite this big launch, HYPE’s price didn’t go up. In fact, it dropped by 11% in the past week, now sitting at around $32.8.

2025-05-30T11:40:50.000Z,"Altcoin Season Index Signals Crucial Shift in Crypto Market","BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season Index Signals Crucial Shift in Crypto Market Are you watching the cryptocurrency market closely? If so, you might have noticed a significant shift in momentum recently. A key indicator, the Altcoin Season Index , has dropped, signalling that the market is firmly in Bitcoin Season . This shift has important implications for investors and enthusiasts alike, impacting Altcoin Performance and highlighting broader Cryptocurrency Trends . What Does the Altcoin Season Index at 22 Really Mean? Let’s dive into the specifics. The Altcoin Season Index , a valuable metric provided by CoinMarketCap (CMC), recently registered a reading of 22. As reported at 00:45 UTC on May 30, this marked a decrease of three points from the previous day. What does this number tell us? It’s a clear indicator that the market is currently experiencing Bitcoin Season . The index itself is quite straightforward in its methodology. It analyzes the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap over the past 90 days. Importantly, it excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens to give a clearer picture of speculative asset performance. The scale runs from 1 to 100. Altcoin Season: For the market to be considered in Altcoin Season, a significant majority – specifically, at least 75% of these top 100 altcoins – must have outperformed Bitcoin over the 90-day period. Bitcoin Season: Conversely, Bitcoin Season is declared when 25% or fewer of these top 100 altcoins have managed to outperform Bitcoin during the same timeframe. The ‘In-Between’: Readings between 25 and 75 typically suggest a more neutral or mixed market environment, where neither Bitcoin nor altcoins have a dominant edge in performance relative to each other. A reading of 22 falls well within the threshold for Bitcoin Season , indicating that over the last three months, a vast majority of the leading altcoins have lagged behind Bitcoin’s price appreciation. Navigating the Crypto Market During Bitcoin Season So, the index says it’s Bitcoin Season . What does this practically mean for those involved in the Crypto Market ? Historically, Bitcoin Season often occurs after a period of strong Bitcoin price increases, where the leading cryptocurrency captures a larger share of the total market capitalization – a metric known as Bitcoin Dominance. While the index specifically tracks relative performance rather than dominance percentage, the two often correlate. During Bitcoin Season , we typically see: Bitcoin Leads the Way: Bitcoin tends to show stronger price momentum and relative stability compared to many altcoins. Altcoins Lag or Decline: Many altcoins may struggle to keep pace with Bitcoin’s gains, and some might even see declines, especially those with lower market caps or less established use cases. Reduced Altcoin Mania: The speculative frenzy often associated with Altcoin Season, where even lesser-known projects can see massive pumps, is typically subdued. Focus Shifts: Investor and media attention often consolidates around Bitcoin’s price movements and developments. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for making informed decisions within the Crypto Market . It doesn’t mean altcoins can’t perform, but the probability of widespread, explosive Altcoin Performance is lower when the index is this low. Comparing Altcoin Performance vs. Bitcoin: The Current Picture The core of the Altcoin Season Index is this direct comparison: how many altcoins are beating Bitcoin over 90 days? With the index at 22, it tells us that roughly only 22% of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in the last three months. This paints a clear picture of where relative strength lies in the market right now. Consider it this way: Metric Condition for Altcoin Season Condition for Bitcoin Season Current Status (Index at 22) % of Top 100 Altcoins Outperforming Bitcoin (Last 90 Days) >= 75% Approx. 22% This table clearly illustrates why the index indicates Bitcoin Season . The vast majority of the largest altcoins have not kept pace with Bitcoin’s price action over the recent past. This isn’t necessarily a judgment on the long-term potential of individual altcoin projects, but it reflects the prevailing short-to-medium term market sentiment and capital flow. Understanding Cryptocurrency Trends: Is This Normal? Observing Cryptocurrency Trends often reveals cyclical patterns. The market rarely moves in a straight line, and periods of Bitcoin dominance are a natural part of these cycles. Historically, a strong Bitcoin rally often precedes or coincides with a period where altcoins lag behind. Sometimes, this is followed by a phase where profits from Bitcoin are rotated into altcoins, potentially triggering a new Altcoin Season. Several factors can contribute to a shift towards Bitcoin Season : Macroeconomic Factors: Uncertainty in traditional markets can sometimes lead investors to favor Bitcoin as a relatively safer, more liquid crypto asset compared to smaller altcoins. Institutional Interest: Large institutional inflows often target Bitcoin first due to its size, liquidity, and established infrastructure (like Bitcoin ETFs). Network Developments: Significant upgrades or events specific to Bitcoin can draw attention and investment. Market Psychology: Strong upward price momentum in Bitcoin can create a fear of missing out (FOMO) effect, pulling capital away from altcoins. Recognizing these Cryptocurrency Trends helps put the current Altcoin Season Index reading into context. It’s a snapshot of the market’s current state, influenced by a confluence of factors. Actionable Insights for the Current Market Given the market is in Bitcoin Season according to the index, what are some things investors might consider? (Note: This is not financial advice, always do your own research). Focus on Bitcoin: If you are bullish on the overall crypto market, concentrating on Bitcoin might align with the current trend indicated by the index. Review Altcoin Holdings: Evaluate the performance of your altcoin portfolio. Are your holdings among the few outperforming Bitcoin, or are they lagging? This might inform decisions about rebalancing. Research Quality Projects: Even in Bitcoin Season, strong altcoin projects with solid fundamentals, active development, and clear use cases can still perform well or present accumulation opportunities at lower prices. Manage Risk: Volatility can still be high. Employ risk management strategies, such as setting stop-losses or diversifying within your crypto portfolio (even if that diversification leans towards Bitcoin). Stay Informed: Keep an eye on the Altcoin Season Index and other market indicators. A shift back towards a higher reading could signal a potential change in dynamics. Understanding the nuances of Altcoin Performance in different market cycles is key to navigating the crypto landscape effectively. Conclusion: Riding the Waves of the Crypto Market The drop in the Altcoin Season Index to 22 is a clear signal that the Crypto Market is currently favoring Bitcoin. This Bitcoin Season means that, for now, Altcoin Performance on average is lagging behind the pioneer cryptocurrency. These Cryptocurrency Trends are part of the market’s natural ebb and flow, influenced by various internal and external factors. While Bitcoin leads, it’s a period for investors to assess their strategies, focus on research, and manage risk, understanding that market conditions can and do change. Staying informed about key indicators like the Altcoin Season Index provides valuable perspective on the prevailing market dynamics.

At the Bitcoin 2025 Conference, which hosted important names for three days, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino also made important statements about Bitcoin (BTC), Tether (USDT) and the cryptocurrency industry. Paolo Ardoino, who made statements supporting and praising Bitcoin, stated that Bitcoin is much more than a digital asset and said, “Bitcoin is the ultimate social network.” Comparing Tether to Facebook, the Tether CEO said, “Tether has experienced growth that is equivalent to what Facebook once did.” Bitcoin and Gold Reserves! Paolo Ardonio, who also announced Tether's reserves, stated that the company has over 100 thousand Bitcoins (worth over $10 billion) and 50 tons of gold in its reserves. Ardoino also said that Tether made around $13 billion in profits in 2024, making it the most successful and profitable name in the crypto industry. The famous CEO also explained Tether's decision to hold gold in its reserves and the reasons for it. Noting that Bitcoin supporters questioned Tether's decision on gold, Ardoino said: “A lot of Bitcoiners don’t like talking about gold because they think it takes something away from Bitcoin. But Bitcoin is perfect. Gold is imperfect. “At this point, gold is not competing with Bitcoin. Gold is competing with fiat money, and that's why we like gold quite a bit.” The famous CEO finally stated that Tether has made a profit of approximately $20 billion in the last three years and said: “Less than 5 percent of this profit has been paid to shareholders. The remaining 95 percent will be used to expand the global distribution network and reinvest in Bitcoin.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-30T11:25:38.000Z,"BTC flatlines at $106K; Bitcoin Pepe frenzy peaks with just 1 day left to buy","Bitcoin (BTC) is hovering near $106,000 on Friday after three straight days of declines that have dragged prices down by nearly 3% this week. The pullback comes amid a rise in profit-taking activity, with data showing that BTC holders selling has reached a three-month high. Despite this near-term selling pressure, institutional interest in Bitcoin remains solid. Firms like Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and GameStop have been adding BTC to their corporate treasuries, underscoring continued confidence in the asset’s long-term value. According to Glassnode’s latest weekly report, investor profitability and spending behavior have picked up meaningfully, though current metrics remain well below levels typically seen at the peak of prior bull markets. This suggests that while short-term corrections are underway, the broader uptrend remains intact with room for further upside if institutional accumulation continues. As Bitcoin remains range-bound and profit-taking sets in following its recent gains, retail attention is shifting toward emerging and unique narratives like Bitcoin Pepe, which is nearing the end of its presale. The flagship cryptocurrency’s increasing maturity, declining volatility, and deepening institutional involvement have diluted its appeal among investors chasing explosive upside potential. This dynamic is evident in Bitcoin’s current inability to break out decisively despite broader market optimism. Meanwhile, early-stage tokens such as Bitcoin Pepe are drawing speculative capital from traders willing to tolerate some risk in pursuit of potentially outsized gains. BTC ETFs inflow streak broken US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $358.6 million in net outflows on Thursday, marking the end of a 10-day streak of positive flows that had brought in a combined $4.26 billion. The reversal underscores a shift in investor sentiment after a sustained period of inflows, largely driven by BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). IBIT was the only fund to post net inflows on the day, attracting $125 million, according to data from SoSoValue. In contrast, Fidelity’s FBTC led the day’s outflows with $166.32 million exiting the fund. Grayscale’s GBTC followed with $107.53 million in net redemptions, while Ark and 21Shares’ ARKB saw $89.22 million in outflows. Bitwise’s BITB posted $70.85 million in redemptions, with additional withdrawals reported from ETFs issued by VanEck, Valkyrie, Invesco, and Franklin Templeton. As of Wednesday, total net inflows across the 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs had reached $45.34 billion. With Thursday’s outflows, the cumulative figure dropped to $44.99 billion. Bitcoin Pepe: time to buy in? Even as Bitcoin stabilizes, its recent push to new highs is once again lifting sentiment across the crypto market — a trend that has historically preceded broader rallies. As capital rotates back into digital assets, speculative segments such as meme coins are drawing heightened investor interest. Bitcoin Pepe is emerging as a key beneficiary of this shift. As the first meme-centric Layer 2 built on the Bitcoin network, Bitcoin Pepe positions itself at the intersection of meme culture and blockchain utility. The project seeks to merge Bitcoin’s security with Solana-like scalability — a technical edge that sets it apart from most meme tokens, which typically lack infrastructure. To develop its Layer 2 ecosystem, Bitcoin Pepe has announced a string of strategic partnerships. These include partnerships with Super Meme, Catamoto, and Plena Finance. A collaboration with the GETE Network also aims to extend Bitcoin Pepe’s reach into the cross-chain Web3 gaming space. The project’s attempt to combine real-world utility with viral meme appeal appears to be gaining traction. Its ongoing presale has raised over $12.4 million, with BPEP tokens currently priced at $0.0377.

2025-05-30T11:15:10.000Z,"$1M BTC by 2030? Best Crypto to Buy Now for x10 Return","The post $1M BTC by 2030? Best Crypto to Buy Now for x10 Return appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin has surged to $111,970, fueling bullish predictions from industry leaders like Robert Kiyosaki, Michael Saylor, and Cathie Wood, all targeting $1M+ BTC by 2030–2035. This bullish trend is driven by macroeconomic factors such as inflation, institutional adoption, and increasing global debt. Bitcoin Pepe is the first meme ICO on the Bitcoin network, solving the gap in meme trading by introducing the PEP-20 token standard. We position BPEP as the ideal cryptocurrency to soar alongside Bitcoin’s $1M trajectory. As Bitcoin achieves a fresh all-time high of $111,970, both short-term and long-term targets for BTC have sparked intense excitement. Prominent financial experts, including Robert Kiyosaki and Michael Saylor, have already predicted a long-term Bitcoin rally that may send Bitcoin’s price above $1 million by 2023. These targets come after the increasing probability of hyperinflation, global debt, and increasing crypto adoption. Michael Saylor, co-founder of MicroStrategy , has also made bold predictions. Recently, at the Bitcoin Conference in Las Vegas, he emphasized Bitcoin ownership and stated that if Wall Street’s BTC ownership rises to 10%, then the price could reach $1 million. The famous author of Rich Dad, Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki , has predicted a long-term Bitcoin price of $1 million by 2035. “I strongly believe, by 2035, that one Bitcoin will be over $1 million, Gold will be $30,000, and silver $3,000 a coin,” Kiyosaki wrote in an X post. Another prominent name in the financial world, Cathie Wood, CEO of ARK Invest , said in a bullish video posted on February 11 that Bitcoin (BTC) could reach $1.5 million by 2030. Wood said Bitcoin would need to grow at a compound annual rate of 58% over the next five years, mainly driven by more institutions adopting it. As more players jump on the Bitcoin train, the hunt for the best crypto to buy now has begun. Savvy investors are focusing on a Bitcoin infrastructure play that could amplify gains by 10X. The Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) token has stolen the spotlight as the best proxy play for Bitcoin, which analysts expect to be the next crypto to explode. Best cryptos to buy now as Bitcoin eyes $1 million While many of the prominent names have given highly optimistic predictions for Bitcoin, a new all-time high has made these more than just predictions. Despite global uncertainties, new developments in the crypto market come as positive news for the broader cryptocurrency community. As the market shifts, investors look for smart plays, while experienced investors are already adding the best crypto to buy now: Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) As Bitcoin approaches the $1 million mark, the first and only meme ICO on the network, Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP), is inclined to experience explosive growth with it. Despite being a meme-centric platform, it aims to solve a long-standing problem Bitcoin holders face: no access to meme trading on the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin Pepe has launched a new token standard, PEP-20. This standard allows developers to mint tokens natively on Bitcoin permissionlessly, creating a safe haven for meme coins on the most trusted blockchain. The platform is also enhancing the architecture to match Solana’s scalability and speed, providing a secure and efficient trading interface for the next meme mania. Bitcoin Pepe announced multiple strategic partnerships with platforms like SuperMeme, BETV, GemuPlay, and Plena Finance, expanding the utility of its native token, BPEP, across the content, gaming, and DeFi spaces. As users of these platforms rushed to acquire the BPEP token, the presale saw a considerable inflow of $1 million within 24 hours. The presale has surpassed the $12.3m milestone, and investors continue to rush to buy BPEP at $0.0377 ahead of its May 31 listing. The platform’s staking pools have been filled with over 200 million tokens, as many investors locked in their BPEP to earn up to 10,000% APY. Bitcoin Pepe has confirmed listing on multiple tier-1 centralized exchanges, which is expected to pump the price to tremendous heights and provide early presale holders with multi-bagger returns. Solana (SOL) The market recognizes Solana (SOL) as an established dominant altcoin because its blockchain system delivers thousands of transactions with minimal fees. Solana stands out from proof-of-work chains by employing a distinct Proof-of-History (PoH), which enables it to be both speedy and efficient in network operations. SOL’s high efficiency has led to widespread use cases among decentralized applications (dApps), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. Solana’s price recently benefited from news of the U.S. crypto reserve, which has SOL as one of its core members. Solana’s price maintains its #6 market position, changing hands at $169.37 while holding a $88 billion market capitalization. SOL provides a strong option for passive income distribution through token staking, which has become the leading choice for crypto investors. Cardano (ADA) Cardano’s long-standing leadership position remains strong in the altcoin market, and since March 2025, it has brought good news for the ADA community. Cardano’s price experienced a boost following Trump’s announcement that ADA will be featured in the U.S. National Crypto Reserve. Image Courtesy: TradingView At press time, the Cardano price is hovering near $0.73, noting a significant 8.68% decrease in the last 7 days. Market analysts predict a positive outlook for ADA despite rumors of its removal from the U.S. Crypto Reserve. Many investors are bullish, claiming that the Cardano price has the potential to move toward its important $1.50 psychological level. Conclusion: The best crypto to buy now Bitcoin’s explosive rally to $111K has reignited bullish momentum across the crypto market. With predictions of $1M BTC by major financial voices, market optimism is stronger than ever. As institutional adoption grows, Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of long-term wealth creation. At the forefront of this momentum is Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) —the first meme ICO on the Bitcoin network. By introducing the PEP-20 standard and securing key partnerships, BPEP is emerging as the top Bitcoin proxy play of 2025. With its presale nearing sell-out and a confirmed May 31 listing, Bitcoin Pepe offers one of the biggest breakout opportunities in the market today.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/information/1m-btc-by-2030-best-crypto-to-buy-now-for-x10-return/,"ADA|BTC|MARKET|SOL|TRADING","Information",cryptocompare
2025-05-30T11:15:00.000Z,"Crypto Daybook Americas:  Bitcoin Slips as Tariff Ruling Reversal Rattles Markets","By Francisco Rodrigues (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Cryptocurrency markets fell Friday as renewed concerns over U.S. trade policy unsettled traditional markets and outweighed news that otherwise might be seen as positive for the industry. The CoinDesk 20 ( CD20 ) Index, a measure of the broad crypto market, fell 4.4% to 3,129 in the past 24 hours. And while bitcoin BTC slipped 2.8% to around $105,300, it's worth keeping in mind the largest cryptocurrency has held above $100,000 for more than 20 consecutive days in a sign of persistent investor demand. The sell-off came as a U.S. appeals court reinstated trade tariffs blocked by a lower court, which had ruled them illegal . The reversal reignited concerns of an extended trade war. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, in an interview, noted that negotiations with China were “a bit stalled,” compounding the uncertainty. “When it comes to global trade right now, the only certainty is uncertainty,” said Darren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown in an emailed statement. Adding to the macroeconomic maelstrom, Trump reportedly pushed Fed Chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates during an in-person meeting at the White House. Bitcoin’s attraction has been clear during the uncertainty. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is at record-low volatility and drawing in billions from investors. Spot bitcoin ETFs have seen $5.85 billion in total net flows this month, up from $2.97 billion in April, according to SoSoVale data. Adding to the momentum, Spanish banking giant Santander is reportedly considering offering retail clients access to cryptocurrencies , while Panama proposed that ships p ay transit fees in its canal in BTC . All eyes now turn to core PCE inflation data, a key gauge for Fed policy. A hot reading later this morning could dash hopes for rate cuts, potentially weighing on risk assets further. “Any sign of worsening inflationary pressure is likely to weigh on expectations for further interest cuts by the Fed this year, which would be a worry given the inertia building in the economy,” Hargreaves Lansdown’s head of equity research wrote. Still, \""the numbers need to be taken with a large pinch of salt, given that they’re yet to feel the full impact of tariffs.\"" For now, bitcoin’s ability to hold the psychological $100,000 line remains a key landmark amid the uncertainty.

A presidential decree references the nation’s mining code and recent tokenization laws, suggesting the land could be allocated for gold or diamond extraction. The CAR token is up 10% in the past 24 hours and has gained 127% this week, with prices starting to climb even before the official announcement. President Touadéra announced the plan on X, framing it as a step toward transparency and easier access to national resources. The land — about the size of 2,500 football fields— lies west of Bossongo village, 45 km from the capital. CAR, which has a market capitalization of $56.63 million and over 18,400 holders, remains down nearly 93% from its all-time high. Derivatives Positioning Premium in ether ETH futures on the CME remains elevated relative to BTC in a sign of persistent bias for the Ethereum blockchain's token. Perpetual funding rates on offshore exchanges paint a similar picture. XLM and AVAX see negative funding rates in a sign of bias for bearish, short positions. The one-year put-call skew on IBIT flipped positive Thursday, indicating renewed bias for put options, offering downside protection. BTC call skews have weakened across the board on Deribit. Block flows on Paradigm featured risk reversals and a large short strangle, involving $100K and $170K strike options, both expiring in December.

2025-05-30T11:05:13.000Z,"Panama City Mayor Floats Bitcoin for Canal Transit, Seeks Regulatory Lighthand","Mayer Mizrachi, the Mayor of Panama City, has suggested allowing ships transiting the crucial Panama Canal to pay in Bitcoin for expedited passage. Speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas on May 29, Mizrachi envisioned a scenario where cargo vessels could effectively “cut the line” through the vital waterway by utilizing the digital currency. During a panel discussion alongside El Salvadoran Bitcoin policy leaders Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert, Mizrachi articulated, “We have a canal — what if you get a perk for paying in Bitcoin, get your ship to go quicker if you pay in Bitcoin.” About Panama Canal The Panama Canal, a monumental waterway connecting the Caribbean and Pacific Oceans, is indispensable for global trade, facilitating approximately 5% of all maritime commerce annually and saving ships weeks of travel time around South America. The canal generated nearly $5 billion in revenue for Panama in its last fiscal year (October 2023 – September 2024), with close to 10,000 ships transiting and transporting 423 million tons of goods. Mizrachi’s proposal comes amidst recent controversy surrounding the canal, including President Donald Trump’s December 2024 announcement of plans for the U.S. to reclaim control, citing concerns over rising Chinese influence and allegedly unfair tolls on American vessels. This move aligns with Panama City’s recent embrace of Bitcoin , having approved the use of cryptocurrency for public payments, including taxes and municipal fees. A Bitcoin-Forward Vision The idea of Bitcoin payments for the Panama Canal is one of several innovative concepts Mayor Mizrachi has put forth as he explores how Panama can emulate El Salvador’s leading role in Bitcoin adoption . He has also championed the establishment of a Bitcoin reserve for Panama City, which accounts for over half of Panama’s global domestic product, noting that such a measure would not require legislative approval. Mizrachi is keen for Panamanian lawmakers to adopt a cautious, hands-off approach to cryptocurrency regulation. He urged legislators to defer work on crypto-specific bills, advocating for a period of observation: “Don’t touch it, don’t get near it, don’t even look at it, let it operate, let it function. Then decide what it needs. Do you want to restrict it or do you want to promote it?” Mizrachi believes that over $5 billion worth of Bitcoin transactions already occur annually in Panama, though much of this adoption is discreet due to lingering apprehension.

2025-05-30T11:00:36.000Z,"Bitcoin’s Moment Is Now As US Debt Train Hits Full Speed: Expert","Lyn Alden, a leading macroeconomic strategist and financial analyst, took the stage at the Bitcoin 2025 conference with a stark warning: the US fiscal deficit is no longer a problem that can be addressed; it is an unstoppable force. Alden’s address centered around the growing structural issues within the US economy, particularly the government’s runaway spending, and the inevitable impact it will have on asset prices, especially scarce assets like Bitcoin. Bitcoin Vs. Unstoppable US Debt “Nothing stops this train,” Alden said, underscoring the severity of the situation. She went on to explain how US fiscal deficits and unemployment rates, which once moved in tandem, have begun to decouple in recent years. “Over the past several years, ever since 2017, we’ve seen a decoupling. Unemployment rates have dropped, yet the federal deficit has ballooned to 6-7% of GDP.” This shift, Alden argues, signals a new fiscal reality that is now irreversible. Alden’s analysis highlighted that this trend has been exacerbated by the pandemic, but it was already in motion long before. She pointed to historical data, emphasizing that during most periods in the past, when unemployment went up, so did federal deficits, but this pattern has now changed. “This is a new era,” Alden stated. “The decoupling of the deficit from unemployment is something that hasn’t been seen for decades.” The implications of this fiscal decoupling are significant for investors, particularly those seeking to protect their portfolios from the erosion of purchasing power caused by inflation. Alden turned her attention to the broader asset landscape, showing how gold and Bitcoin have responded to the shifting economic climate. She displayed a chart comparing gold prices to real interest rates, illustrating a strong historical correlation between the two. Related Reading: Bitcoin Warning: Bull Trap Or $270,000 Rocket? Analyst Exposes What’s Coming Gold and Bitcoin are the two primary reserve assets that compete with each other at that scale,” Alden explained. “When real interest rates are high, investors are enticed to return to the dollar and treasury system. But when those rates are not high enough to keep pace with inflation, gold and Bitcoin shine.” Alden noted that since 2022, the correlation between gold prices and real rates has broken down, a development that further complicates the economic landscape. “We’ve entered a new environment where both gold and Bitcoin have continued to rise despite rising interest rates,” she pointed out, highlighting the growing divergence between traditional financial assets and alternative assets like Bitcoin. “If you’d asked anyone five years ago whether Bitcoin could hold its ground with interest rates at 4-5%, most would have said no. Yet, here we are, with Bitcoin worth over $100,000 per coin.” Why Bitcoin Wins For Alden, this shift is not merely theoretical; it is evidence of a deeper, more entrenched fiscal dynamic. She argued that as US government debt reaches unsustainable levels, traditional methods of controlling inflation, such as raising interest rates, have become ineffective. “When they raise interest rates, they ironically increase the federal deficit at a faster pace than they slow down private sector credit growth,” she explained. “The problem is that we no longer have the brakes attached to the system. The fiscal train is moving full speed ahead, and there’s nothing in place to slow it down.” Alden also explored how the Fed’s interest rate policies are increasingly unable to control credit growth in the face of rising government debt. “In the past, when federal debt was low, raising interest rates could slow down credit growth effectively. But now, with federal debt surpassing 100% of GDP, every rate hike just accelerates the deficit.” This, she argued, illustrates the structural weakness of the current system—one where the government is forced to keep increasing its debt, as there is no viable way to unwind the fiscal burden. Related Reading: Bitcoin Up 15% in a Month, Analyst Cautions on MVRV Resistance Level In stark contrast to the US fiscal system, Alden presented Bitcoin as the ultimate hedge against these inflationary pressures. “Bitcoin is the opposite of this system,” she noted. “Unlike the US dollar, which is constantly being debased by inflationary policies, Bitcoin is an asset defined by absolute scarcity. You can’t create more of it. And that scarcity is what makes Bitcoin an attractive store of value in an era of fiat instability.” Alden also made the case for Bitcoin’s growing relevance in a world where traditional financial mechanisms are faltering. “The rules that governed the economy for the past century no longer work,” she said. “We’ve gone through the looking glass. We are in a new era where nothing can stop the fiscal train. But Bitcoin, with its transparent ledger and fixed supply, stands apart as an asset that can’t be manipulated or inflated away.” In conclusion, Alden warned that the fiscal trajectory of the US is set for the long haul. “For the next decade, we will be running very large fiscal deficits in the US, almost regardless of what else happens,” she said. “Nothing can meaningfully decelerate this trend. The only way to protect yourself is to own the highest quality scarce assets. And Bitcoin is at the top of that list.” At press time, BTC traded at $105,822.

2025-05-30T11:00:02.000Z,"Bitcoin (BTC) Pulls Back After Recent High – Is Now Time To Consider Mutuum Finance (MUTM) For Future Gains?","Bitcoin (BTC) recently soared to a new all-time high above $111K before experiencing a pullback today. The pullback comes amidst plans for new tariffs by the US government. While this has rattled crypto investors, there are still opportunities for massive gains since the overall bullish trend is holding. One such opportunity is the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project, which recently passed a Certik audit. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) – The Best Deal Of 2025 Based on recent developments, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up to be the best deal of 2025. One such development is the recently announced beta version drop on the token listing day. The announcement has led to an uptick in interest in the presale, which is currently in phase 5. Even before investors could digest the good news, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) released the results of its Certik audit. This double dose of positive news has pushed the presale to new heights, and it has now raised over $9.4 million from over 11,200 investors. At the current price of $0.03 per token, investors in the presale stand to make back 100% of their investment, based on the $0.06 listing price. So far, over 7% of the phase 5 presale tokens have been sold, barely a week after they launched. In the previous phase 4, the token price was at $0.025, and has since increased by 20%. The price will go up by 16.67% in the upcoming phase 6, further diminishing the possible returns on listing day. However, that in itself is not expected to dampen interest in the presale, due to the project increase in the price after the tokens go live. Conservative estimates are calling for a 3x increase in price on listing day, followed by bigger gains in the days after. One reason for this is that MUTM tokens are expected to get a listing on a top-tier exchange. While the team has not confirmed anything, the positive results of the Certik audit will make it much easier to earn a listing on a top-tier platform, where a Certik audit is one of the requirements. How Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Will Change DeFi With the Certik audit confirming that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) developers are not just about the hype, it is time to focus on the value proposition. The main value of the project derives from its dual-mode protocol, which aims to transform DeFi lending. In the first mode, known as peer-to-contract (P2C), lenders can deposit their funds in a collective lending pool, governed by an audited smart contract. They can then start to earn interest on their funds on an annual percentage yield basis. The rate at which they earn is determined dynamically by the pool’s utilization rate. Lenders who deposit their assets in a pool will have instant access to liquidity, due to the innovative mtTokens. For instance, when a lender deposits $2,500 worth of ETH, they will receive mtETH tokens. These tokens represent their share in the pool, as well as the interest accrued. These mtTokens are based on the well-known ERC-20 standard. As such, they can be traded on secondary exchanges, or used as collateral for new loans on Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The tokens also allowed holders to benefit from other market opportunities elsewhere as they arise, without having to unstake their assets. In the second mode, called peer-to-peer (P2P), users can interact directly with each other to lend and borrow more speculative assets like the SHIB meme coin. Since the actions occur in a separate section, the overall stability of the protocol is insulated from the high volatility of these assets. Users can explore numerous conditions, including setting their preferred rate and lending periods. The approach allows holders of assets traditionally held for speculative trading to unlock their earning opportunities. Earning Through Dividends The concept of receiving dividends from a platform’s profits, is a concept reserved for the legacy financial system. However, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) finance has brought the concept over into DeFi. They plan to use protocol profits to buy MUTM tokens from the open market, and redistribute them to stakers within the platform. Not only will this ensure positive price pressure on MUTM tokens, but it will also create an avenue for steady passive income for stakers. All distributions will be done transparently to increase confidence and trust in the project. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) does not aim to be just another DeFi project. Its goal is to change DeFi forever by launching something transformative that will take blockchain technology to the next level. In the future, it could be the dominant protocol in DeFi, and you have an opportunity to be part of that future, at the low price of $0.03 in the ongoing presale.

2025-05-30T10:56:06.000Z,"Crypto Could Shatter Public Trust in Banks, Warns European Central Bank Official","The post Crypto Could Shatter Public Trust in Banks, Warns European Central Bank Official appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As traditional banks grow more curious and increasingly involved in crypto, not everyone’s celebrating the shift. On Friday, European Central Bank (ECB) policymaker and Bank of Italy Governor Fabio Panetta raised a red flag . Panetta sees serious risk. His message was clear: banks diving into digital assets could end up paying a price in customer trust. And if that trust cracks, it’s not just crypto that takes the hit – it’s the entire financial system. So, what’s got the ECB sounding the alarm? And why now, when crypto adoption seems more mainstream than ever? Let’s break it down. The Confidence Risk Banks Can’t Ignore At the Bank of Italy’s annual report presentation, Panetta made his concerns public. He warned that as more banks strike deals with crypto firms, they risk confusing customers who might assume these products come with the same safeguards as traditional banking. “Crypto-asset holders might not fully understand their nature and conflate them with traditional banking products, with potentially negative repercussions for confidence in the credit system should losses occur,” Panetta said. To be fair, it’s not just a hypothetical problem. If people lose money thinking their bank-backed crypto is as safe as a savings account, the fallout could do real damage to public confidence. Europe’s Banks Are Already in Deep! Despite the risks, some of Europe’s biggest financial institutions are already in the game. Italy’s Intesa Sanpaolo made a splash earlier this year when it bought one million euros worth of Bitcoin. CEO Carlo Messina called it a “test,” but the move was just one step in a broader crypto strategy. The bank set up its own digital asset trading desk in 2023 and is now handling spot crypto trades. Meanwhile, over in Spain, Santander is reportedly planning a deeper crypto push. According to Bloomberg, the bank is considering launching a stablecoin and offering crypto access to retail users through its digital platform. These developments are exactly the kind Panetta is watching closely. They reflect the increasing integration between traditional banks and the crypto world – a shift that’s happening faster than regulators may be ready for. Something to think about. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : India’s Crypto Regulation Policy Coming in June: What We Know So Far , Stablecoins and Big Tech: A Bigger Threat? Panetta didn’t stop at crypto-assets. He also called out stablecoins , warning that their growth could undercut traditional payment systems especially if big tech firms decide to throw their weight behind them. “In the absence of adequate regulation, their suitability as a means of payment is doubtful, to say the least,” he said. His concern is that massive tech platforms could promote stablecoins on a global scale, sidelining central bank money in the process. Europe’s Strategy: Compete With Crypto, Not Ban It Still, Panetta isn’t calling for a crackdown. Instead, he sees the solution in catching up – not clamping down. That’s where the European Central Bank’s digital euro project comes in. “What is needed is a response that matches the ongoing technological transformation,” he said. “The digital euro project stems precisely from this need.” In short, Panetta’s message is this: crypto’s not going away. But if banks and regulators don’t move carefully and quickly public trust could take a hit. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-30T10:47:38.000Z,"Why Is Crypto Down Today? – May 30, 2025","The crypto market stays in the red as the market works to consolidate. All top 10 coins per market cap have seen their prices drop over the past 24 hours. At the same time, the cryptocurrency market capitalization has decreased by 4.5%, falling from $3.55 trillion to $3.45 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $130 billion, rising over the past two days. TLDR: Crypto market works to stabilize; BTC decreased to the $105,800 level; Analysts argue the market is likely seeing a correction rather than a bearish reversal; BTC may continue to trade within the current range; US spot BTC ETFs break the inflow streak; Any unexpected strength in inflation could introduce volatility and pressure crypto prices. Crypto Winners & Losers At the time of writing, all the top 10 coins per market capitalization are down. Bitcoin (BTC) has decreased by 2% to the price of $105,816 from yesterday’s price of $107,940. This is also down from the intraday high of $108,847. Ethereum (ETH) fell by 3.8%, now trading at $2,623. This is also a drop from the intraday high of $2,732. The highest drop in this category is Dogecoin (DOGE)’s 8.7%. The coin is currently changing hands at $0.2052. Of the top 100 coins, one is green today. LEO Token (LEO) appreciated 1.1% to the price of $9.14. Optimism (OP) recorded the highest decrease in this category, having dropped 12.7% to $0.6863. According to James Toledano, Chief Operating Officer at Unity Wallet , Bitcoin’s rally has already priced in bullish catalysts like institutional inflows and geopolitical uncertainty. The COO argues that, “With open interest still high and funding rates relatively neutral, this sideways movement suggests a temporary breather rather than a trend reversal.” Now, the liquidity is tightening ahead of key economic data, so “traders are likely adopting a wait-and-see approach,” Toledano says. “I see it as a stabilization and not a stall, reflecting a classic consolidation phase after strong gains earlier in the month.” ‘New Normal Created by Trump Threatens Economic Stability’ In a comment, Toledano opined that price compression at the current level may set the stage for a larger breakout or breakdown. This will depend on macro cues and risk sentiment. Notably, he highlights, “All bets are off as we brace for what might come out of President Trump’s administration next. This new normal potentially threatens any notion of economic stability and consistency.” Moreover, Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at crypto platform YouHodler , says that the recent activity seems to be a correction rather than a bearish reversal. For much of this year, he argues, BTC has traded within the $90,000–$110,000 range. This has become a key consolidation zone. “This area is saturated with market orders, suggesting strong trading interest and potential support. Given these dynamics, it is likely that BTC will continue to trade within this range for some time, potentially building a solid foundation for the next leg higher toward a new all-time high,” Lienkha says. $BTC options open interest recently hit an all-time high of $46.2B – up +$25.8B from the lows. This sharp growth outpaces futures and signals rising demand for more advanced hedging and strategy execution as market participants grow more sophisticated. pic.twitter.com/YXp24CRVfC — glassnode (@glassnode) May 29, 2025 Moreover, comparing BTC and ETH, Lienkha says the former is seen more as a portfolio diversifier, even if allocations remain relatively small. The latter, however, is “still perceived as a more niche or ‘exotic’ alternative, and broad institutional adoption is likely still some way off.” Nonetheless, due to its strong fundamentals, Ethereum is a popular portfolio diversifier among retail investors. Finally, Lienkha expects Bitcoin to maintain a correlation with US tech equity indices over the medium term, as both are sensitive to macroeconomic conditions such as interest rates and liquidity. However, this correlation may gradually weaken over time as Bitcoin matures as an asset class with distinct drivers. Levels & Events to Watch Next BTC is currently trading at $105,816, moving further away from its all-time high of $111,814, which it hit last Thursday. It’s down 5.5% since. It’s still up 1.6% in a week. The coin has largely been trading around the $106,000 level over the last few hours. However, it broke two support levels in two days. The next one is the $105,000 level, which traders will keep an eye on. Betideas.com spokesman Steven McQuillan commented that BTC grew $15,000 in value in May alone. Traders are predicting the trend will continue. “Our experts are saying there’s an 80% chance that we see a new all-time high in 2025,” he says. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: Tradingview Moreover, the Fear and Greed Index continues falling. It has decreased from 65 to 61 in a day. This is also down from 76 seen last Friday. This is still the greed zone, but it’s moving towards neutral. This suggests that fear is moving in and may potentially drive prices down. While this would mean a red market, it would also present buying opportunities. Source: CoinMarketCap Meanwhile, on 29 May, US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw their net inflow streak broken. It recorded $385.65 million in net outflows. BlackRock is the only one with an increase, recording $125.09 million. On the other hand, US ETH spot ETFs saw $91.93 million in net inflows, including BlackRock’s $50.45 million. Moreover, Unity Wallet’s Toledano noted that there could well be heightened volatility as markets digest the latest PCE inflation data, jobless claims, and Nvidia’s record-breaking $26 billion quarter. “The combination of potentially soft inflation, a cooling labor market, and positive tech earnings from a giant like Nvidia could create a supportive environment for Bitcoin [which often tracks tech-driven rallies],” Toledano says. “If the PCE data meets or undershoots expectations, it might reduce concerns about aggressive Federal Reserve policy, further benefiting Bitcoin. However, any unexpected strength in inflation could still introduce volatility and pressure crypto prices, despite Nvidia’s positive influence.” Quick FAQ Why did crypto move against stocks today? While the crypto market recorded a decrease, the stock market saw a slight uptick. The S&P 500 has increased by 0.4%, the Nasdaq-100 is up 0.21%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.28%. The stock market reacted well to Nvidia’s profits, but the gains were limited nonetheless. Investors are on high alert due to many judicial events related to Donald Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs. Is this dip sustainable? Analysts argue that the market is currently seeing a correction, rather than a bearish trend, getting ready for the next leg up. However, it’s still highly sensitive to macroeconomic conditions such as interest rates and liquidity.

2025-05-30T10:45:03.000Z,"AI could surpass Bitcoin mining in power consumption by 2026: Study","A study by PhD candidate Alex de Vries-Gao revealed that AI could soon surpass Bitcoin mining in energy consumption. The new analysis claimed that AI could use nearly half of all the power consumed by data centers globally by the end of 2025. De Vries-Gao’s study concluded that AI could be drawing as much electricity as some mid-sized European nations by the end of this year, and the numbers are only rising. AI already accounts for up to a fifth of the power used by data centers, but it is still tricky to pin down the exact figures without big tech companies sharing data on how much energy their AI models consume. In 2023 and 2024, the adoption of generative AI applications drew media attention to the increasing power demand for these applications. Tech companies faced a “power capacity crisis” in their efforts to expand data center capacity as power demand rose to support these applications. De Vries-Gao makes projections based on the ‘triangulation’ technique AI has a power problem. While tech giants pour billions into development, they're hitting a wall that has nothing to do with chips, algorithms, or talent. The problem is fundamental: the electrical grid can't handle what's coming. The latest Prinsights linked below details why. pic.twitter.com/0L4JXJgebV — Nomi Prins (@nomiprins) May 28, 2025 De Vries-Gao made projections based on the supply chain for specialized computer chips used for AI as he and other researchers tried to understand AI’s energy consumption. The researchers discovered that AI’s energy appetite is growing fast enough to warrant more scrutiny despite efficiency gains. To figure this out, De Vries-Gao used what he called a “triangulation” technique. The researcher turned to publicly available device details, analyst estimates, and companies’ earnings calls to estimate hardware production for AI and how much energy that hardware is likely to use. De Vries-Gao calculated how specialized AI equipment could be produced and compared that to information about how much electricity these devices consumed. He found that last year, they likely burned through as much electricity as his home country of the Netherlands . “That’s how we know that both Google’s and Microsoft’s carbon footprints have grown in recent years as they focus on AI. But companies usually don’t break down the data to show what’s attributable to AI specifically.” – Alex de Vries-Gao , the founder of Digiconomist Last week, a separate report from consulting firm ICF forecasted a 25% rise in energy demand in the U.S. by the end of the decade, largely thanks to AI, traditional data centers, and Bitcoin mining. Another article published in MIT Technology Review last week, with support from the Tarbell Center for AI Journalism, claimed that it is still hard to make blanket predictions about AI’s energy consumption and the resulting environmental impact. Meta plans to power a giant AI data center with gas Meta announced in mid-May that it is building a new AI data center so large in Louisiana that the local utility company planned to set up three new gas-fired power plants to provide it with enough energy. However, advocates and lawmakers pressed Meta for answers about how it would clean up pollution from the data center’s energy consumption. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) wrote a letter to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on May 14 demanding answers about how much energy the data center would use. He also sought answers about the greenhouse gas emissions that would be generated. The letter pointed out that the gas-powered new data center flew in the face of Meta’s climate commitments. Sen. Whitehouse also stated that Meta’s backslide from its own climate pledges in 2020 risks triggering broader economic harm at a time when corporate responsibility is urgently needed. Logan Burke, the Executive Director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, claimed it is hard to figure out whether a facility like Meta’s is good or bad for communities without understanding the possible impact on electrical systems, bills, and water. However, Meta maintained that it will continue matching its electricity use with support for renewable energy, including a commitment to help fund 1,500 megawatts of new solar and battery resources in Louisiana.

2025-05-30T10:42:58.000Z,"Bitcoin (BTC) Benefits from Bullish Bets, Altcoins Punish the Optimists","While the collective crypto market has witnessed significant recovery this month, there is a growing disconnect in risk appetite among market participants. Investors are correctly positioned for Bitcoin’s rally, but similar optimism in the altcoin space has resulted in heavy losses, shows a recent report. Trader Missteps in Altcoins Since the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, there has been a notable divergence has emerged in the liquidation patterns of BTC and altcoins. Data from Binance reveals that the largest cryptocurrency experienced a dominance of short liquidations totaling $190 million. This trend, according to a new analysis by CryptoQuant, suggests that traders betting against BTC during its price appreciation were consistently forced to exit their positions as the market moved higher. On the other hand, the same cannot be said for altcoins. During the same period, long liquidations in altcoins surged to nearly $1 billion, which was indicative of a continued downward pressure across the broader altcoin market and failed bets on a widespread recovery. As such, the report stated this as a clear sign of liquidation asymmetry. While BTC’s rally led to short squeezes and upward momentum, altcoins saw traders punished for attempting to preempt an “Altseason” that never materialized. Since December 2024, this pattern has intensified, with altcoin liquidations consistently outpacing those of BTC. CryptoQuant attributed this to excessive leverage and misaligned market sentiment, as altcoin bulls were increasingly forced to unwind losing positions. Few Altcoin Gems Emerge as Market Lags Despite the broader underperformance in the altcoin market, some assets stand out. According to analyst Rekt Fencer, increased stablecoin liquidity, a dip in Bitcoin dominance, and a recovering ETH/BTC ratio point to rising investor appetite for altcoins. He named five altcoins – GRASS, PENDLE, ONDO, ENA, and SEI – that he predicts could surge 50x-100x if market momentum continues. These tokens represent strong narratives, including decentralized infrastructure, tokenized yields, real-world asset exposure, synthetic dollars, and high-speed DeFi ecosystems. Meanwhile, other altcoins such as Tron (TRX) have shown resilience, and experts expect it to “multiply significantly in value,” potentially even quadrupling, if Bitcoin continues its bull run through the rest of the year. Sui (SUI) is yet another crypto that has witnessed the emergence of a bullish sentiment.

In January 2024, the crypto OTC infrastructure firm Finery Markets reported that institutional OTC volumes jumped 106% last year.Cointelegraph approached Hidden Road for comment regarding the estimated OTC volumes globally and in the US, but had not received a response by the time of publication.Rising institutional demandIn December 2024, Higgins highlighted a rising demand for institutional balance sheets from large institutions in an interview with Finance Magnates.“Servicing them [institutional investors] across traditional finance and digital asset ecosystems that have already converged presents a really unique opportunity for us in the marketplace.”Hidden Road’s OTC swap launch in the US marks one of the first products launched by the firm since the company entered a definitive agreement to be acquired by Ripple.Related: Taurus, Parfin partnership to provide crypto infrastructure to institutionsSoon after the deal was announced, Hidden Road received a broker-dealer license from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, a private US corporation and self-regulatory organization regulating member brokerage firms and exchange markets.Hidden Road is also known as one of the first companies to receive a Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) license in Europe, immediately after the framework entered into full force on Dec. 30, 2024.
