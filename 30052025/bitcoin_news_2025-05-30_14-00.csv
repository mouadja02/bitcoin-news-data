2025-05-30T12:00:02.000Z,"Alchemy Pay Powers Seamless On-Ramp for WLFI’s USD1 Stablecoin","BitcoinWorld Alchemy Pay Powers Seamless On-Ramp for WLFI’s USD1 Stablecoin Getting into the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) and stablecoins can sometimes feel like navigating a complex maze. However, a recent collaboration aims to simplify this process significantly for users interested in the USD1 stablecoin . Crypto payment gateway Alchemy Pay (ACH) has officially announced a strategic partnership with World Liberty Financial ( WLFI ), a DeFi project that has garnered attention due to its links to the Trump family. This collaboration marks a significant step towards providing seamless crypto on-ramp access for WLFI ‘s USD1 stablecoin , directly addressing one of the major hurdles for mainstream crypto adoption: converting fiat currency into digital assets easily and efficiently. What Does This Alchemy Pay and WLFI Partnership Entail? The core of this partnership revolves around integrating Alchemy Pay ‘s robust payment gateway services with the WLFI ecosystem. Announced via Alchemy Pay ‘s official Medium blog, the collaboration means that users no longer need to navigate potentially complex cryptocurrency exchanges or peer-to-peer platforms to acquire USD1 stablecoin . Instead, they can leverage Alchemy Pay ‘s extensive network of supported payment methods to directly purchase USD1 using their preferred fiat currency. For those new to the space, a ‘ crypto on-ramp ‘ is essentially a service that allows individuals to convert their traditional fiat money (like USD, EUR, GBP, etc.) into cryptocurrency. Think of it as the bridge between the traditional financial system and the crypto world. Making this bridge as smooth and accessible as possible is crucial for increasing user adoption and liquidity within specific crypto ecosystems like WLFI ‘s. By integrating Alchemy Pay ‘s capabilities, WLFI is significantly lowering the barrier to entry for potential users of its USD1 stablecoin and associated DeFi services. This is particularly important for a project seeking wider reach and participation. Why is Seamless Crypto On-Ramp Access Important for USD1 Stablecoin ? Stablecoins like USD1 stablecoin are designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. They serve multiple purposes within the crypto landscape, including: Store of Value: Offering stability compared to volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Medium of Exchange: Facilitating quick and low-cost transfers globally. DeFi Participation: Acting as essential building blocks for lending, borrowing, and yield farming protocols within decentralized finance platforms. However, accessing stablecoins often requires users to first buy a major cryptocurrency (like BTC or ETH) on an exchange and then trade it for the stablecoin. This multi-step process can be intimidating and cumbersome for newcomers. A direct crypto on-ramp solution, powered by a reputable payment gateway like Alchemy Pay , streamlines this process into potentially just a few clicks, making it far more user-friendly. For WLFI ‘s USD1 stablecoin , enhanced accessibility via a direct on-ramp means: Increased liquidity for USD1 . Easier participation in any DeFi protocols or services offered by WLFI that utilize USD1 . A broader potential user base, including those less familiar with traditional crypto exchanges. How Does Alchemy Pay ‘s Payment Gateway Facilitate This? Alchemy Pay operates a comprehensive payment gateway that connects fiat and crypto economies. Its infrastructure supports a wide array of global and local payment methods, making it a versatile tool for businesses and projects looking to integrate crypto payments or on/off-ramps. Key features of Alchemy Pay ‘s payment gateway that benefit the WLFI partnership include: Extensive Payment Method Support: Acceptance of major credit and debit cards (Visa, Mastercard), various bank transfer options, and numerous local payment channels specific to different regions. Global Coverage: Ability to process transactions from users in many countries, expanding the potential reach for WLFI ‘s USD1 stablecoin . Compliance and Security: Handling necessary regulatory compliance and security measures for processing fiat-to-crypto transactions. Ease of Integration: Providing tools and APIs that allow partners like WLFI to seamlessly embed the on-ramp service directly into their platforms or websites. This technical capability is what underpins the ‘seamless access’ touted in the announcement. Users interacting with WLFI ‘s platform (or wherever the integration is live) can now initiate a purchase of USD1 stablecoin and complete the transaction using familiar fiat payment methods, all powered by Alchemy Pay ‘s backend. Exploring the WLFI Project and USD1 Stablecoin World Liberty Financial ( WLFI ) is positioned as a DeFi project. While the original announcement highlights its link to the Trump family, the core focus from a technical perspective is its offering, specifically the USD1 stablecoin . Understanding WLFI ‘s broader goals and the intended use cases for USD1 stablecoin provides context for why a seamless crypto on-ramp is a critical piece of infrastructure for them. Typically, DeFi projects aim to recreate traditional financial services (like lending, borrowing, trading) using blockchain technology, often utilizing stablecoins as the primary medium of value exchange due to their price stability. For WLFI , the USD1 stablecoin likely serves as the native stable asset within its specific DeFi ecosystem or planned applications. Making it easy for users to acquire USD1 directly with fiat is essential for driving activity and participation within that ecosystem. The partnership with Alchemy Pay suggests WLFI is prioritizing user accessibility and aiming to onboard users who may be new to DeFi or crypto but are interested in the specific offerings or community around WLFI . Benefits of the Partnership: A Closer Look Let’s break down the tangible benefits this collaboration brings: For WLFI : Access to Alchemy Pay ‘s global payment gateway network instantly expands the potential user base for USD1 stablecoin . It removes technical hurdles for onboarding new users who hold fiat, increasing liquidity and potentially driving adoption of other WLFI services. It positions WLFI as a more accessible DeFi project. For USD1 Stablecoin Users: The primary benefit is convenience. Users can now purchase USD1 stablecoin directly using their local fiat payment methods without needing to use separate exchanges or complex crypto wallets initially. This simplifies the process significantly, saving time and potentially reducing fees associated with multiple transactions. For the Broader Crypto Ecosystem: Partnerships like this contribute to the overall goal of making cryptocurrency and DeFi more accessible to a mainstream audience. By providing user-friendly on-ramps for specific assets like USD1 stablecoin , they help bridge the gap between traditional finance and the decentralized world. Actionable Insight: How to Use the New On-Ramp While specific steps may vary slightly depending on where WLFI integrates the service, the general process for users wishing to purchase USD1 stablecoin via the Alchemy Pay payment gateway would typically involve: Visiting the official WLFI platform or a service that has integrated the Alchemy Pay on-ramp. Locating the option to ‘Buy USD1 ‘ or ‘Add Funds’. Selecting Alchemy Pay as the payment provider. Choosing their preferred fiat currency and the amount of USD1 they wish to purchase. Selecting a supported payment method (e.g., Visa, Mastercard, bank transfer). Completing the required payment and verification steps through Alchemy Pay ‘s secure interface. Receiving the purchased USD1 stablecoin directly into their connected crypto wallet. This streamlined flow is designed to mimic familiar online purchase experiences, reducing friction for users entering the crypto space. The Road Ahead for Alchemy Pay and WLFI This partnership is a clear indication of both Alchemy Pay ‘s continued strategy to expand its payment gateway services across various crypto projects and WLFI ‘s effort to enhance the accessibility of its USD1 stablecoin . As the DeFi space evolves, seamless on-ramps will remain a critical component for attracting and retaining users. The success of this integration will likely be measured by the ease of use reported by users and the increase in accessibility and liquidity for the USD1 stablecoin within the WLFI ecosystem. Partnerships like this highlight the ongoing effort within the crypto industry to build user-friendly infrastructure that connects the traditional financial world with the innovative possibilities of blockchain and DeFi. Conclusion: Bridging Fiat and USD1 Stablecoin with Ease The strategic partnership between Alchemy Pay and WLFI is a significant development for anyone interested in accessing the USD1 stablecoin . By integrating Alchemy Pay ‘s versatile payment gateway , WLFI has effectively created a seamless crypto on-ramp , allowing users to purchase USD1 stablecoin directly using a wide range of fiat payment methods. This move not only enhances the accessibility of USD1 but also contributes to lowering the barrier to entry for the WLFI DeFi ecosystem. As the crypto landscape matures, collaborations focused on improving the user experience, particularly at the fiat-to-crypto conversion point, are essential for driving wider adoption. This partnership is a prime example of such an effort, promising a more convenient path for users to acquire USD1 stablecoin and engage with the WLFI project.

2025-05-30T11:40:50.000Z,"Altcoin Season Index Signals Crucial Shift in Crypto Market","BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season Index Signals Crucial Shift in Crypto Market Are you watching the cryptocurrency market closely? If so, you might have noticed a significant shift in momentum recently. A key indicator, the Altcoin Season Index , has dropped, signalling that the market is firmly in Bitcoin Season . This shift has important implications for investors and enthusiasts alike, impacting Altcoin Performance and highlighting broader Cryptocurrency Trends . What Does the Altcoin Season Index at 22 Really Mean? Let’s dive into the specifics. The Altcoin Season Index , a valuable metric provided by CoinMarketCap (CMC), recently registered a reading of 22. As reported at 00:45 UTC on May 30, this marked a decrease of three points from the previous day. What does this number tell us? It’s a clear indicator that the market is currently experiencing Bitcoin Season . The index itself is quite straightforward in its methodology. It analyzes the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap over the past 90 days. Importantly, it excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens to give a clearer picture of speculative asset performance. The scale runs from 1 to 100. Altcoin Season: For the market to be considered in Altcoin Season, a significant majority – specifically, at least 75% of these top 100 altcoins – must have outperformed Bitcoin over the 90-day period. Bitcoin Season: Conversely, Bitcoin Season is declared when 25% or fewer of these top 100 altcoins have managed to outperform Bitcoin during the same timeframe. The ‘In-Between’: Readings between 25 and 75 typically suggest a more neutral or mixed market environment, where neither Bitcoin nor altcoins have a dominant edge in performance relative to each other. A reading of 22 falls well within the threshold for Bitcoin Season , indicating that over the last three months, a vast majority of the leading altcoins have lagged behind Bitcoin’s price appreciation. Navigating the Crypto Market During Bitcoin Season So, the index says it’s Bitcoin Season . What does this practically mean for those involved in the Crypto Market ? Historically, Bitcoin Season often occurs after a period of strong Bitcoin price increases, where the leading cryptocurrency captures a larger share of the total market capitalization – a metric known as Bitcoin Dominance. While the index specifically tracks relative performance rather than dominance percentage, the two often correlate. During Bitcoin Season , we typically see: Bitcoin Leads the Way: Bitcoin tends to show stronger price momentum and relative stability compared to many altcoins. Altcoins Lag or Decline: Many altcoins may struggle to keep pace with Bitcoin’s gains, and some might even see declines, especially those with lower market caps or less established use cases. Reduced Altcoin Mania: The speculative frenzy often associated with Altcoin Season, where even lesser-known projects can see massive pumps, is typically subdued. Focus Shifts: Investor and media attention often consolidates around Bitcoin’s price movements and developments. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for making informed decisions within the Crypto Market . It doesn’t mean altcoins can’t perform, but the probability of widespread, explosive Altcoin Performance is lower when the index is this low. Comparing Altcoin Performance vs. Bitcoin: The Current Picture The core of the Altcoin Season Index is this direct comparison: how many altcoins are beating Bitcoin over 90 days? With the index at 22, it tells us that roughly only 22% of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in the last three months. This paints a clear picture of where relative strength lies in the market right now. Consider it this way: Metric Condition for Altcoin Season Condition for Bitcoin Season Current Status (Index at 22) % of Top 100 Altcoins Outperforming Bitcoin (Last 90 Days) >= 75% Approx. 22% This table clearly illustrates why the index indicates Bitcoin Season . The vast majority of the largest altcoins have not kept pace with Bitcoin’s price action over the recent past. This isn’t necessarily a judgment on the long-term potential of individual altcoin projects, but it reflects the prevailing short-to-medium term market sentiment and capital flow. Understanding Cryptocurrency Trends: Is This Normal? Observing Cryptocurrency Trends often reveals cyclical patterns. The market rarely moves in a straight line, and periods of Bitcoin dominance are a natural part of these cycles. Historically, a strong Bitcoin rally often precedes or coincides with a period where altcoins lag behind. Sometimes, this is followed by a phase where profits from Bitcoin are rotated into altcoins, potentially triggering a new Altcoin Season. Several factors can contribute to a shift towards Bitcoin Season : Macroeconomic Factors: Uncertainty in traditional markets can sometimes lead investors to favor Bitcoin as a relatively safer, more liquid crypto asset compared to smaller altcoins. Institutional Interest: Large institutional inflows often target Bitcoin first due to its size, liquidity, and established infrastructure (like Bitcoin ETFs). Network Developments: Significant upgrades or events specific to Bitcoin can draw attention and investment. Market Psychology: Strong upward price momentum in Bitcoin can create a fear of missing out (FOMO) effect, pulling capital away from altcoins. Recognizing these Cryptocurrency Trends helps put the current Altcoin Season Index reading into context. It’s a snapshot of the market’s current state, influenced by a confluence of factors. Actionable Insights for the Current Market Given the market is in Bitcoin Season according to the index, what are some things investors might consider? (Note: This is not financial advice, always do your own research). Focus on Bitcoin: If you are bullish on the overall crypto market, concentrating on Bitcoin might align with the current trend indicated by the index. Review Altcoin Holdings: Evaluate the performance of your altcoin portfolio. Are your holdings among the few outperforming Bitcoin, or are they lagging? This might inform decisions about rebalancing. Research Quality Projects: Even in Bitcoin Season, strong altcoin projects with solid fundamentals, active development, and clear use cases can still perform well or present accumulation opportunities at lower prices. Manage Risk: Volatility can still be high. Employ risk management strategies, such as setting stop-losses or diversifying within your crypto portfolio (even if that diversification leans towards Bitcoin). Stay Informed: Keep an eye on the Altcoin Season Index and other market indicators. A shift back towards a higher reading could signal a potential change in dynamics. Understanding the nuances of Altcoin Performance in different market cycles is key to navigating the crypto landscape effectively. Conclusion: Riding the Waves of the Crypto Market The drop in the Altcoin Season Index to 22 is a clear signal that the Crypto Market is currently favoring Bitcoin. This Bitcoin Season means that, for now, Altcoin Performance on average is lagging behind the pioneer cryptocurrency. These Cryptocurrency Trends are part of the market’s natural ebb and flow, influenced by various internal and external factors. While Bitcoin leads, it’s a period for investors to assess their strategies, focus on research, and manage risk, understanding that market conditions can and do change. Staying informed about key indicators like the Altcoin Season Index provides valuable perspective on the prevailing market dynamics.

At the Bitcoin 2025 Conference, which hosted important names for three days, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino also made important statements about Bitcoin (BTC), Tether (USDT) and the cryptocurrency industry. Paolo Ardoino, who made statements supporting and praising Bitcoin, stated that Bitcoin is much more than a digital asset and said, “Bitcoin is the ultimate social network.” Comparing Tether to Facebook, the Tether CEO said, “Tether has experienced growth that is equivalent to what Facebook once did.” Bitcoin and Gold Reserves! Paolo Ardonio, who also announced Tether's reserves, stated that the company has over 100 thousand Bitcoins (worth over $10 billion) and 50 tons of gold in its reserves. Ardoino also said that Tether made around $13 billion in profits in 2024, making it the most successful and profitable name in the crypto industry. The famous CEO also explained Tether's decision to hold gold in its reserves and the reasons for it. Noting that Bitcoin supporters questioned Tether's decision on gold, Ardoino said: “A lot of Bitcoiners don’t like talking about gold because they think it takes something away from Bitcoin. But Bitcoin is perfect. Gold is imperfect. “At this point, gold is not competing with Bitcoin. Gold is competing with fiat money, and that's why we like gold quite a bit.” The famous CEO finally stated that Tether has made a profit of approximately $20 billion in the last three years and said: “Less than 5 percent of this profit has been paid to shareholders. The remaining 95 percent will be used to expand the global distribution network and reinvest in Bitcoin.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-30T11:25:38.000Z,"BTC flatlines at $106K; Bitcoin Pepe frenzy peaks with just 1 day left to buy","Bitcoin (BTC) is hovering near $106,000 on Friday after three straight days of declines that have dragged prices down by nearly 3% this week. The pullback comes amid a rise in profit-taking activity, with data showing that BTC holders selling has reached a three-month high. Despite this near-term selling pressure, institutional interest in Bitcoin remains solid. Firms like Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and GameStop have been adding BTC to their corporate treasuries, underscoring continued confidence in the asset’s long-term value. According to Glassnode’s latest weekly report, investor profitability and spending behavior have picked up meaningfully, though current metrics remain well below levels typically seen at the peak of prior bull markets. This suggests that while short-term corrections are underway, the broader uptrend remains intact with room for further upside if institutional accumulation continues. As Bitcoin remains range-bound and profit-taking sets in following its recent gains, retail attention is shifting toward emerging and unique narratives like Bitcoin Pepe, which is nearing the end of its presale. The flagship cryptocurrency’s increasing maturity, declining volatility, and deepening institutional involvement have diluted its appeal among investors chasing explosive upside potential. This dynamic is evident in Bitcoin’s current inability to break out decisively despite broader market optimism. Meanwhile, early-stage tokens such as Bitcoin Pepe are drawing speculative capital from traders willing to tolerate some risk in pursuit of potentially outsized gains. BTC ETFs inflow streak broken US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $358.6 million in net outflows on Thursday, marking the end of a 10-day streak of positive flows that had brought in a combined $4.26 billion. The reversal underscores a shift in investor sentiment after a sustained period of inflows, largely driven by BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). IBIT was the only fund to post net inflows on the day, attracting $125 million, according to data from SoSoValue. In contrast, Fidelity’s FBTC led the day’s outflows with $166.32 million exiting the fund. Grayscale’s GBTC followed with $107.53 million in net redemptions, while Ark and 21Shares’ ARKB saw $89.22 million in outflows. Bitwise’s BITB posted $70.85 million in redemptions, with additional withdrawals reported from ETFs issued by VanEck, Valkyrie, Invesco, and Franklin Templeton. As of Wednesday, total net inflows across the 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs had reached $45.34 billion. With Thursday’s outflows, the cumulative figure dropped to $44.99 billion. Bitcoin Pepe: time to buy in? Even as Bitcoin stabilizes, its recent push to new highs is once again lifting sentiment across the crypto market — a trend that has historically preceded broader rallies. As capital rotates back into digital assets, speculative segments such as meme coins are drawing heightened investor interest. Bitcoin Pepe is emerging as a key beneficiary of this shift. As the first meme-centric Layer 2 built on the Bitcoin network, Bitcoin Pepe positions itself at the intersection of meme culture and blockchain utility. The project seeks to merge Bitcoin’s security with Solana-like scalability — a technical edge that sets it apart from most meme tokens, which typically lack infrastructure. To develop its Layer 2 ecosystem, Bitcoin Pepe has announced a string of strategic partnerships. These include partnerships with Super Meme, Catamoto, and Plena Finance. A collaboration with the GETE Network also aims to extend Bitcoin Pepe’s reach into the cross-chain Web3 gaming space. The project’s attempt to combine real-world utility with viral meme appeal appears to be gaining traction. Its ongoing presale has raised over $12.4 million, with BPEP tokens currently priced at $0.0377. With just over a day left until the presale ends on May 31, 2025, Bitcoin Pepe is drawing increased attention. A listing on centralized exchanges is expected soon after, a potential near-term catalyst for price action.

Best Crypto to Buy Now for x10 Return appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin has surged to $111,970, fueling bullish predictions from industry leaders like Robert Kiyosaki, Michael Saylor, and Cathie Wood, all targeting $1M+ BTC by 2030–2035. This bullish trend is driven by macroeconomic factors such as inflation, institutional adoption, and increasing global debt. Bitcoin Pepe is the first meme ICO on the Bitcoin network, solving the gap in meme trading by introducing the PEP-20 token standard. We position BPEP as the ideal cryptocurrency to soar alongside Bitcoin’s $1M trajectory. As Bitcoin achieves a fresh all-time high of $111,970, both short-term and long-term targets for BTC have sparked intense excitement. Prominent financial experts, including Robert Kiyosaki and Michael Saylor, have already predicted a long-term Bitcoin rally that may send Bitcoin’s price above $1 million by 2023. These targets come after the increasing probability of hyperinflation, global debt, and increasing crypto adoption. Michael Saylor, co-founder of MicroStrategy , has also made bold predictions. Recently, at the Bitcoin Conference in Las Vegas, he emphasized Bitcoin ownership and stated that if Wall Street’s BTC ownership rises to 10%, then the price could reach $1 million. The famous author of Rich Dad, Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki , has predicted a long-term Bitcoin price of $1 million by 2035. “I strongly believe, by 2035, that one Bitcoin will be over $1 million, Gold will be $30,000, and silver $3,000 a coin,” Kiyosaki wrote in an X post. Another prominent name in the financial world, Cathie Wood, CEO of ARK Invest , said in a bullish video posted on February 11 that Bitcoin (BTC) could reach $1.5 million by 2030. Wood said Bitcoin would need to grow at a compound annual rate of 58% over the next five years, mainly driven by more institutions adopting it. As more players jump on the Bitcoin train, the hunt for the best crypto to buy now has begun. Savvy investors are focusing on a Bitcoin infrastructure play that could amplify gains by 10X. The Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) token has stolen the spotlight as the best proxy play for Bitcoin, which analysts expect to be the next crypto to explode. Best cryptos to buy now as Bitcoin eyes $1 million While many of the prominent names have given highly optimistic predictions for Bitcoin, a new all-time high has made these more than just predictions. Despite global uncertainties, new developments in the crypto market come as positive news for the broader cryptocurrency community. As the market shifts, investors look for smart plays, while experienced investors are already adding the best crypto to buy now: Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) As Bitcoin approaches the $1 million mark, the first and only meme ICO on the network, Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP), is inclined to experience explosive growth with it. Despite being a meme-centric platform, it aims to solve a long-standing problem Bitcoin holders face: no access to meme trading on the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin Pepe has launched a new token standard, PEP-20. This standard allows developers to mint tokens natively on Bitcoin permissionlessly, creating a safe haven for meme coins on the most trusted blockchain. The platform is also enhancing the architecture to match Solana’s scalability and speed, providing a secure and efficient trading interface for the next meme mania. Bitcoin Pepe announced multiple strategic partnerships with platforms like SuperMeme, BETV, GemuPlay, and Plena Finance, expanding the utility of its native token, BPEP, across the content, gaming, and DeFi spaces. As users of these platforms rushed to acquire the BPEP token, the presale saw a considerable inflow of $1 million within 24 hours. The presale has surpassed the $12.3m milestone, and investors continue to rush to buy BPEP at $0.0377 ahead of its May 31 listing. The platform’s staking pools have been filled with over 200 million tokens, as many investors locked in their BPEP to earn up to 10,000% APY. Bitcoin Pepe has confirmed listing on multiple tier-1 centralized exchanges, which is expected to pump the price to tremendous heights and provide early presale holders with multi-bagger returns. Solana (SOL) The market recognizes Solana (SOL) as an established dominant altcoin because its blockchain system delivers thousands of transactions with minimal fees. Solana stands out from proof-of-work chains by employing a distinct Proof-of-History (PoH), which enables it to be both speedy and efficient in network operations. SOL’s high efficiency has led to widespread use cases among decentralized applications (dApps), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. Solana’s price recently benefited from news of the U.S. crypto reserve, which has SOL as one of its core members. Solana’s price maintains its #6 market position, changing hands at $169.37 while holding a $88 billion market capitalization. SOL provides a strong option for passive income distribution through token staking, which has become the leading choice for crypto investors. Cardano (ADA) Cardano’s long-standing leadership position remains strong in the altcoin market, and since March 2025, it has brought good news for the ADA community. Cardano’s price experienced a boost following Trump’s announcement that ADA will be featured in the U.S. National Crypto Reserve. Image Courtesy: TradingView At press time, the Cardano price is hovering near $0.73, noting a significant 8.68% decrease in the last 7 days. Market analysts predict a positive outlook for ADA despite rumors of its removal from the U.S. Crypto Reserve. Many investors are bullish, claiming that the Cardano price has the potential to move toward its important $1.50 psychological level. Conclusion: The best crypto to buy now Bitcoin’s explosive rally to $111K has reignited bullish momentum across the crypto market. With predictions of $1M BTC by major financial voices, market optimism is stronger than ever. As institutional adoption grows, Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of long-term wealth creation. At the forefront of this momentum is Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) —the first meme ICO on the Bitcoin network. By introducing the PEP-20 standard and securing key partnerships, BPEP is emerging as the top Bitcoin proxy play of 2025. With its presale nearing sell-out and a confirmed May 31 listing, Bitcoin Pepe offers one of the biggest breakout opportunities in the market today.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/information/1m-btc-by-2030-best-crypto-to-buy-now-for-x10-return/,"ADA|BTC|MARKET|SOL|TRADING","Information",cryptocompare
2025-05-30T11:15:00.000Z,"Crypto Daybook Americas:  Bitcoin Slips as Tariff Ruling Reversal Rattles Markets","By Francisco Rodrigues (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Cryptocurrency markets fell Friday as renewed concerns over U.S. trade policy unsettled traditional markets and outweighed news that otherwise might be seen as positive for the industry. The CoinDesk 20 ( CD20 ) Index, a measure of the broad crypto market, fell 4.4% to 3,129 in the past 24 hours. And while bitcoin BTC slipped 2.8% to around $105,300, it's worth keeping in mind the largest cryptocurrency has held above $100,000 for more than 20 consecutive days in a sign of persistent investor demand. The sell-off came as a U.S. appeals court reinstated trade tariffs blocked by a lower court, which had ruled them illegal . The reversal reignited concerns of an extended trade war. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, in an interview, noted that negotiations with China were “a bit stalled,” compounding the uncertainty. “When it comes to global trade right now, the only certainty is uncertainty,” said Darren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown in an emailed statement. Adding to the macroeconomic maelstrom, Trump reportedly pushed Fed Chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates during an in-person meeting at the White House. Bitcoin’s attraction has been clear during the uncertainty. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is at record-low volatility and drawing in billions from investors. Spot bitcoin ETFs have seen $5.85 billion in total net flows this month, up from $2.97 billion in April, according to SoSoVale data. Adding to the momentum, Spanish banking giant Santander is reportedly considering offering retail clients access to cryptocurrencies , while Panama proposed that ships p ay transit fees in its canal in BTC . All eyes now turn to core PCE inflation data, a key gauge for Fed policy. A hot reading later this morning could dash hopes for rate cuts, potentially weighing on risk assets further. “Any sign of worsening inflationary pressure is likely to weigh on expectations for further interest cuts by the Fed this year, which would be a worry given the inertia building in the economy,” Hargreaves Lansdown’s head of equity research wrote. Still, \""the numbers need to be taken with a large pinch of salt, given that they’re yet to feel the full impact of tariffs.\"" For now, bitcoin’s ability to hold the psychological $100,000 line remains a key landmark amid the uncertainty.

A presidential decree references the nation’s mining code and recent tokenization laws, suggesting the land could be allocated for gold or diamond extraction. The CAR token is up 10% in the past 24 hours and has gained 127% this week, with prices starting to climb even before the official announcement. President Touadéra announced the plan on X, framing it as a step toward transparency and easier access to national resources. The land — about the size of 2,500 football fields— lies west of Bossongo village, 45 km from the capital. CAR, which has a market capitalization of $56.63 million and over 18,400 holders, remains down nearly 93% from its all-time high. Derivatives Positioning Premium in ether ETH futures on the CME remains elevated relative to BTC in a sign of persistent bias for the Ethereum blockchain's token. Perpetual funding rates on offshore exchanges paint a similar picture. XLM and AVAX see negative funding rates in a sign of bias for bearish, short positions. The one-year put-call skew on IBIT flipped positive Thursday, indicating renewed bias for put options, offering downside protection. BTC call skews have weakened across the board on Deribit. Block flows on Paradigm featured risk reversals and a large short strangle, involving $100K and $170K strike options, both expiring in December.

No expensive mining rigs, no noisy fans, no complicated setups—just your phone, doing what it does best, but for your wallet. This is not some distant dream or exaggerated marketing pitch. It’s the emerging reality crafted by Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S), the project rewriting what passive income looks like in the crypto world.

2025-05-30T11:05:13.000Z,"Panama City Mayor Floats Bitcoin for Canal Transit, Seeks Regulatory Lighthand","Mayer Mizrachi, the Mayor of Panama City, has suggested allowing ships transiting the crucial Panama Canal to pay in Bitcoin for expedited passage. Speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas on May 29, Mizrachi envisioned a scenario where cargo vessels could effectively “cut the line” through the vital waterway by utilizing the digital currency. During a panel discussion alongside El Salvadoran Bitcoin policy leaders Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert, Mizrachi articulated, “We have a canal — what if you get a perk for paying in Bitcoin, get your ship to go quicker if you pay in Bitcoin.” About Panama Canal The Panama Canal, a monumental waterway connecting the Caribbean and Pacific Oceans, is indispensable for global trade, facilitating approximately 5% of all maritime commerce annually and saving ships weeks of travel time around South America. The canal generated nearly $5 billion in revenue for Panama in its last fiscal year (October 2023 – September 2024), with close to 10,000 ships transiting and transporting 423 million tons of goods. Mizrachi’s proposal comes amidst recent controversy surrounding the canal, including President Donald Trump’s December 2024 announcement of plans for the U.S. to reclaim control, citing concerns over rising Chinese influence and allegedly unfair tolls on American vessels. This move aligns with Panama City’s recent embrace of Bitcoin , having approved the use of cryptocurrency for public payments, including taxes and municipal fees. A Bitcoin-Forward Vision The idea of Bitcoin payments for the Panama Canal is one of several innovative concepts Mayor Mizrachi has put forth as he explores how Panama can emulate El Salvador’s leading role in Bitcoin adoption . He has also championed the establishment of a Bitcoin reserve for Panama City, which accounts for over half of Panama’s global domestic product, noting that such a measure would not require legislative approval. Mizrachi is keen for Panamanian lawmakers to adopt a cautious, hands-off approach to cryptocurrency regulation. He urged legislators to defer work on crypto-specific bills, advocating for a period of observation: “Don’t touch it, don’t get near it, don’t even look at it, let it operate, let it function. Then decide what it needs. Do you want to restrict it or do you want to promote it?” Mizrachi believes that over $5 billion worth of Bitcoin transactions already occur annually in Panama, though much of this adoption is discreet due to lingering apprehension.

2025-05-30T11:00:42.000Z,"Nigel Farage To Establish Bitcoin Reserve As Potential Next UK Prime Minister","At the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Nigel Farage, the leading candidate in the UK’s upcoming general election, announced a plan to establish a Bitcoin reserve within the Bank of England if he assumes office. During a fireside chat with Frank Corva on the event’s third day, Farage revealed groundbreaking details of his vision for the UK’s cryptocurrency future. UK To Establish A Bitcoin Reserve Under Farage’s Lead “I’m thrilled to be here today but to announce that rather than just words, we have put together—this is exclusive for today—the crypto assets and digital finance bill,” Farage began . “Months of work, ladies and gentlemen, we will campaign for this and we’ll put it in place when we win the next general election.” Central to Farage’s proposal is the creation of a Bitcoin reserve in the Bank of England. “We are going to have a Bitcoin digital reserve in the Bank of England ,” he declared. “And we are going to pass legislation that says that no bank can close your account because you’re trading in legal crypto or digital products.” This initiative would directly address the growing concern of “debanking”—where individuals are denied banking services due to their involvement with cryptocurrency. As Farage emphasized, “No more debanking, ladies and gentlemen.” In his speech, Farage pointed to the UK’s stagnation in embracing the digital financial revolution. “Seven million people in Britain have got crypto assets. One in four people under 30 have got crypto assets. And yet, our outdated Labour and Conservative governments have done nothing in this space at all.” He framed the potential reforms as a much-needed step to bring the UK into the 21st century, positioning the nation as a leader in the global crypto ecosystem. “We are going to launch, in Britain, a crypto revolution. We’re going to make London one of the major trading centers of the world,” he asserted. Farage also reflected on the broader international context, particularly the United States’ current stance on crypto. “What this administration has done to embrace this whole area, to give real oxygen and real energy to the whole digital world is nothing short of fantastic,” Farage noted. A key point of Farage’s platform is his advocacy for national and individual sovereignty. Drawing parallels between his campaign for Brexit and Bitcoin’s potential for personal freedom, Farage highlighted his consistent belief in reducing governmental interference. “Bitcoin is the ultimate freedom from big government,” he stated, explaining that the growing control of governments and bureaucracies—evidenced by movements like the push for Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) —was something to resist. Farage expressed strong opposition to the Bank of England’s ongoing efforts to develop a British version of a CBDC, dubbed “ Britcoin .” He described it as “the ultimate form of tyranny,” voicing his concerns about government surveillance and control over individuals’ financial lives. “When we win the next election, there’ll be a CBDC over my dead body,” he declared firmly. The conversation also touched on Farage’s personal experience with “debanking,” a topic that has shaped much of his passion for Bitcoin. Farage, who became a high-profile victim of debanking, explained how he was denied banking services by ten different banks, solely due to his political views and involvement in crypto. “It was a very, very scary experience,” Farage admitted. “But I fought back. I fought back publicly, and I won.” At press time, BTC traded at $106,293.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/nigel-farage-bitcoin-reserve-uk-prime-minister/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|Nigel Farage|UK|UK Strategic Bitcoin Reserve",cryptocompare
2025-05-30T11:00:36.000Z,"Bitcoin’s Moment Is Now As US Debt Train Hits Full Speed: Expert","Lyn Alden, a leading macroeconomic strategist and financial analyst, took the stage at the Bitcoin 2025 conference with a stark warning: the US fiscal deficit is no longer a problem that can be addressed; it is an unstoppable force. Alden’s address centered around the growing structural issues within the US economy, particularly the government’s runaway spending, and the inevitable impact it will have on asset prices, especially scarce assets like Bitcoin. Bitcoin Vs. Unstoppable US Debt “Nothing stops this train,” Alden said, underscoring the severity of the situation. She went on to explain how US fiscal deficits and unemployment rates, which once moved in tandem, have begun to decouple in recent years. “Over the past several years, ever since 2017, we’ve seen a decoupling. Unemployment rates have dropped, yet the federal deficit has ballooned to 6-7% of GDP.” This shift, Alden argues, signals a new fiscal reality that is now irreversible. Alden’s analysis highlighted that this trend has been exacerbated by the pandemic, but it was already in motion long before. She pointed to historical data, emphasizing that during most periods in the past, when unemployment went up, so did federal deficits, but this pattern has now changed. “This is a new era,” Alden stated. “The decoupling of the deficit from unemployment is something that hasn’t been seen for decades.” The implications of this fiscal decoupling are significant for investors, particularly those seeking to protect their portfolios from the erosion of purchasing power caused by inflation. Alden turned her attention to the broader asset landscape, showing how gold and Bitcoin have responded to the shifting economic climate. She displayed a chart comparing gold prices to real interest rates, illustrating a strong historical correlation between the two. Related Reading: Bitcoin Warning: Bull Trap Or $270,000 Rocket? Analyst Exposes What’s Coming Gold and Bitcoin are the two primary reserve assets that compete with each other at that scale,” Alden explained. “When real interest rates are high, investors are enticed to return to the dollar and treasury system. But when those rates are not high enough to keep pace with inflation, gold and Bitcoin shine.” Alden noted that since 2022, the correlation between gold prices and real rates has broken down, a development that further complicates the economic landscape. “We’ve entered a new environment where both gold and Bitcoin have continued to rise despite rising interest rates,” she pointed out, highlighting the growing divergence between traditional financial assets and alternative assets like Bitcoin. “If you’d asked anyone five years ago whether Bitcoin could hold its ground with interest rates at 4-5%, most would have said no. Yet, here we are, with Bitcoin worth over $100,000 per coin.” Why Bitcoin Wins For Alden, this shift is not merely theoretical; it is evidence of a deeper, more entrenched fiscal dynamic. She argued that as US government debt reaches unsustainable levels, traditional methods of controlling inflation, such as raising interest rates, have become ineffective. “When they raise interest rates, they ironically increase the federal deficit at a faster pace than they slow down private sector credit growth,” she explained. “The problem is that we no longer have the brakes attached to the system. The fiscal train is moving full speed ahead, and there’s nothing in place to slow it down.” Alden also explored how the Fed’s interest rate policies are increasingly unable to control credit growth in the face of rising government debt. “In the past, when federal debt was low, raising interest rates could slow down credit growth effectively. But now, with federal debt surpassing 100% of GDP, every rate hike just accelerates the deficit.” This, she argued, illustrates the structural weakness of the current system—one where the government is forced to keep increasing its debt, as there is no viable way to unwind the fiscal burden. Related Reading: Bitcoin Up 15% in a Month, Analyst Cautions on MVRV Resistance Level In stark contrast to the US fiscal system, Alden presented Bitcoin as the ultimate hedge against these inflationary pressures. “Bitcoin is the opposite of this system,” she noted. “Unlike the US dollar, which is constantly being debased by inflationary policies, Bitcoin is an asset defined by absolute scarcity. You can’t create more of it. And that scarcity is what makes Bitcoin an attractive store of value in an era of fiat instability.” Alden also made the case for Bitcoin’s growing relevance in a world where traditional financial mechanisms are faltering. “The rules that governed the economy for the past century no longer work,” she said. “We’ve gone through the looking glass. We are in a new era where nothing can stop the fiscal train. But Bitcoin, with its transparent ledger and fixed supply, stands apart as an asset that can’t be manipulated or inflated away.” In conclusion, Alden warned that the fiscal trajectory of the US is set for the long haul. “For the next decade, we will be running very large fiscal deficits in the US, almost regardless of what else happens,” she said. “Nothing can meaningfully decelerate this trend. The only way to protect yourself is to own the highest quality scarce assets. And Bitcoin is at the top of that list.” At press time, BTC traded at $105,822.

2025-05-30T11:00:02.000Z,"Bitcoin (BTC) Pulls Back After Recent High – Is Now Time To Consider Mutuum Finance (MUTM) For Future Gains?","Bitcoin (BTC) recently soared to a new all-time high above $111K before experiencing a pullback today. The pullback comes amidst plans for new tariffs by the US government. While this has rattled crypto investors, there are still opportunities for massive gains since the overall bullish trend is holding. One such opportunity is the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project, which recently passed a Certik audit. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) – The Best Deal Of 2025 Based on recent developments, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up to be the best deal of 2025. One such development is the recently announced beta version drop on the token listing day. The announcement has led to an uptick in interest in the presale, which is currently in phase 5. Even before investors could digest the good news, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) released the results of its Certik audit. This double dose of positive news has pushed the presale to new heights, and it has now raised over $9.4 million from over 11,200 investors. At the current price of $0.03 per token, investors in the presale stand to make back 100% of their investment, based on the $0.06 listing price. So far, over 7% of the phase 5 presale tokens have been sold, barely a week after they launched. In the previous phase 4, the token price was at $0.025, and has since increased by 20%. The price will go up by 16.67% in the upcoming phase 6, further diminishing the possible returns on listing day. However, that in itself is not expected to dampen interest in the presale, due to the project increase in the price after the tokens go live. Conservative estimates are calling for a 3x increase in price on listing day, followed by bigger gains in the days after. One reason for this is that MUTM tokens are expected to get a listing on a top-tier exchange. While the team has not confirmed anything, the positive results of the Certik audit will make it much easier to earn a listing on a top-tier platform, where a Certik audit is one of the requirements. How Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Will Change DeFi With the Certik audit confirming that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) developers are not just about the hype, it is time to focus on the value proposition. The main value of the project derives from its dual-mode protocol, which aims to transform DeFi lending. In the first mode, known as peer-to-contract (P2C), lenders can deposit their funds in a collective lending pool, governed by an audited smart contract. They can then start to earn interest on their funds on an annual percentage yield basis. The rate at which they earn is determined dynamically by the pool’s utilization rate. Lenders who deposit their assets in a pool will have instant access to liquidity, due to the innovative mtTokens. For instance, when a lender deposits $2,500 worth of ETH, they will receive mtETH tokens. These tokens represent their share in the pool, as well as the interest accrued. These mtTokens are based on the well-known ERC-20 standard. As such, they can be traded on secondary exchanges, or used as collateral for new loans on Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The tokens also allowed holders to benefit from other market opportunities elsewhere as they arise, without having to unstake their assets. In the second mode, called peer-to-peer (P2P), users can interact directly with each other to lend and borrow more speculative assets like the SHIB meme coin. Since the actions occur in a separate section, the overall stability of the protocol is insulated from the high volatility of these assets. Users can explore numerous conditions, including setting their preferred rate and lending periods. The approach allows holders of assets traditionally held for speculative trading to unlock their earning opportunities. Earning Through Dividends The concept of receiving dividends from a platform’s profits, is a concept reserved for the legacy financial system. However, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) finance has brought the concept over into DeFi. They plan to use protocol profits to buy MUTM tokens from the open market, and redistribute them to stakers within the platform. Not only will this ensure positive price pressure on MUTM tokens, but it will also create an avenue for steady passive income for stakers. All distributions will be done transparently to increase confidence and trust in the project. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) does not aim to be just another DeFi project. Its goal is to change DeFi forever by launching something transformative that will take blockchain technology to the next level. In the future, it could be the dominant protocol in DeFi, and you have an opportunity to be part of that future, at the low price of $0.03 in the ongoing presale.

2025-05-30T10:56:06.000Z,"Crypto Could Shatter Public Trust in Banks, Warns European Central Bank Official","The post Crypto Could Shatter Public Trust in Banks, Warns European Central Bank Official appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As traditional banks grow more curious and increasingly involved in crypto, not everyone’s celebrating the shift. On Friday, European Central Bank (ECB) policymaker and Bank of Italy Governor Fabio Panetta raised a red flag . Panetta sees serious risk. His message was clear: banks diving into digital assets could end up paying a price in customer trust. And if that trust cracks, it’s not just crypto that takes the hit – it’s the entire financial system. So, what’s got the ECB sounding the alarm? And why now, when crypto adoption seems more mainstream than ever? Let’s break it down. The Confidence Risk Banks Can’t Ignore At the Bank of Italy’s annual report presentation, Panetta made his concerns public. He warned that as more banks strike deals with crypto firms, they risk confusing customers who might assume these products come with the same safeguards as traditional banking. “Crypto-asset holders might not fully understand their nature and conflate them with traditional banking products, with potentially negative repercussions for confidence in the credit system should losses occur,” Panetta said. To be fair, it’s not just a hypothetical problem. If people lose money thinking their bank-backed crypto is as safe as a savings account, the fallout could do real damage to public confidence. Europe’s Banks Are Already in Deep! Despite the risks, some of Europe’s biggest financial institutions are already in the game. Italy’s Intesa Sanpaolo made a splash earlier this year when it bought one million euros worth of Bitcoin. CEO Carlo Messina called it a “test,” but the move was just one step in a broader crypto strategy. The bank set up its own digital asset trading desk in 2023 and is now handling spot crypto trades. Meanwhile, over in Spain, Santander is reportedly planning a deeper crypto push. According to Bloomberg, the bank is considering launching a stablecoin and offering crypto access to retail users through its digital platform. These developments are exactly the kind Panetta is watching closely. They reflect the increasing integration between traditional banks and the crypto world – a shift that’s happening faster than regulators may be ready for. Something to think about. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : India’s Crypto Regulation Policy Coming in June: What We Know So Far , Stablecoins and Big Tech: A Bigger Threat? Panetta didn’t stop at crypto-assets. He also called out stablecoins , warning that their growth could undercut traditional payment systems especially if big tech firms decide to throw their weight behind them. “In the absence of adequate regulation, their suitability as a means of payment is doubtful, to say the least,” he said. His concern is that massive tech platforms could promote stablecoins on a global scale, sidelining central bank money in the process. Europe’s Strategy: Compete With Crypto, Not Ban It Still, Panetta isn’t calling for a crackdown. Instead, he sees the solution in catching up – not clamping down. That’s where the European Central Bank’s digital euro project comes in. “What is needed is a response that matches the ongoing technological transformation,” he said. “The digital euro project stems precisely from this need.” In short, Panetta’s message is this: crypto’s not going away. But if banks and regulators don’t move carefully and quickly public trust could take a hit. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

This is also down from the intraday high of $108,847. Ethereum (ETH) fell by 3.8%, now trading at $2,623. This is also a drop from the intraday high of $2,732. The highest drop in this category is Dogecoin (DOGE)’s 8.7%. The coin is currently changing hands at $0.2052. Of the top 100 coins, one is green today. LEO Token (LEO) appreciated 1.1% to the price of $9.14. Optimism (OP) recorded the highest decrease in this category, having dropped 12.7% to $0.6863. According to James Toledano, Chief Operating Officer at Unity Wallet , Bitcoin’s rally has already priced in bullish catalysts like institutional inflows and geopolitical uncertainty. The COO argues that, “With open interest still high and funding rates relatively neutral, this sideways movement suggests a temporary breather rather than a trend reversal.” Now, the liquidity is tightening ahead of key economic data, so “traders are likely adopting a wait-and-see approach,” Toledano says. “I see it as a stabilization and not a stall, reflecting a classic consolidation phase after strong gains earlier in the month.” ‘New Normal Created by Trump Threatens Economic Stability’ In a comment, Toledano opined that price compression at the current level may set the stage for a larger breakout or breakdown. This will depend on macro cues and risk sentiment. Notably, he highlights, “All bets are off as we brace for what might come out of President Trump’s administration next. This new normal potentially threatens any notion of economic stability and consistency.” Moreover, Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at crypto platform YouHodler , says that the recent activity seems to be a correction rather than a bearish reversal. For much of this year, he argues, BTC has traded within the $90,000–$110,000 range. This has become a key consolidation zone. “This area is saturated with market orders, suggesting strong trading interest and potential support. Given these dynamics, it is likely that BTC will continue to trade within this range for some time, potentially building a solid foundation for the next leg higher toward a new all-time high,” Lienkha says. $BTC options open interest recently hit an all-time high of $46.2B – up +$25.8B from the lows. This sharp growth outpaces futures and signals rising demand for more advanced hedging and strategy execution as market participants grow more sophisticated. pic.twitter.com/YXp24CRVfC — glassnode (@glassnode) May 29, 2025 Moreover, comparing BTC and ETH, Lienkha says the former is seen more as a portfolio diversifier, even if allocations remain relatively small. The latter, however, is “still perceived as a more niche or ‘exotic’ alternative, and broad institutional adoption is likely still some way off.” Nonetheless, due to its strong fundamentals, Ethereum is a popular portfolio diversifier among retail investors. Finally, Lienkha expects Bitcoin to maintain a correlation with US tech equity indices over the medium term, as both are sensitive to macroeconomic conditions such as interest rates and liquidity. However, this correlation may gradually weaken over time as Bitcoin matures as an asset class with distinct drivers. Levels & Events to Watch Next BTC is currently trading at $105,816, moving further away from its all-time high of $111,814, which it hit last Thursday. It’s down 5.5% since. It’s still up 1.6% in a week. The coin has largely been trading around the $106,000 level over the last few hours. However, it broke two support levels in two days. The next one is the $105,000 level, which traders will keep an eye on. Betideas.com spokesman Steven McQuillan commented that BTC grew $15,000 in value in May alone. Traders are predicting the trend will continue. “Our experts are saying there’s an 80% chance that we see a new all-time high in 2025,” he says. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: Tradingview Moreover, the Fear and Greed Index continues falling. It has decreased from 65 to 61 in a day. This is also down from 76 seen last Friday. This is still the greed zone, but it’s moving towards neutral. This suggests that fear is moving in and may potentially drive prices down. While this would mean a red market, it would also present buying opportunities. Source: CoinMarketCap Meanwhile, on 29 May, US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw their net inflow streak broken. It recorded $385.65 million in net outflows. BlackRock is the only one with an increase, recording $125.09 million. On the other hand, US ETH spot ETFs saw $91.93 million in net inflows, including BlackRock’s $50.45 million. Moreover, Unity Wallet’s Toledano noted that there could well be heightened volatility as markets digest the latest PCE inflation data, jobless claims, and Nvidia’s record-breaking $26 billion quarter. “The combination of potentially soft inflation, a cooling labor market, and positive tech earnings from a giant like Nvidia could create a supportive environment for Bitcoin [which often tracks tech-driven rallies],” Toledano says. “If the PCE data meets or undershoots expectations, it might reduce concerns about aggressive Federal Reserve policy, further benefiting Bitcoin. However, any unexpected strength in inflation could still introduce volatility and pressure crypto prices, despite Nvidia’s positive influence.” Quick FAQ Why did crypto move against stocks today? While the crypto market recorded a decrease, the stock market saw a slight uptick. The S&P 500 has increased by 0.4%, the Nasdaq-100 is up 0.21%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.28%. The stock market reacted well to Nvidia’s profits, but the gains were limited nonetheless. Investors are on high alert due to many judicial events related to Donald Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs. Is this dip sustainable? Analysts argue that the market is currently seeing a correction, rather than a bearish trend, getting ready for the next leg up. However, it’s still highly sensitive to macroeconomic conditions such as interest rates and liquidity.

2025-05-30T10:45:03.000Z,"AI could surpass Bitcoin mining in power consumption by 2026: Study","A study by PhD candidate Alex de Vries-Gao revealed that AI could soon surpass Bitcoin mining in energy consumption. The new analysis claimed that AI could use nearly half of all the power consumed by data centers globally by the end of 2025. De Vries-Gao’s study concluded that AI could be drawing as much electricity as some mid-sized European nations by the end of this year, and the numbers are only rising. AI already accounts for up to a fifth of the power used by data centers, but it is still tricky to pin down the exact figures without big tech companies sharing data on how much energy their AI models consume. In 2023 and 2024, the adoption of generative AI applications drew media attention to the increasing power demand for these applications. Tech companies faced a “power capacity crisis” in their efforts to expand data center capacity as power demand rose to support these applications. De Vries-Gao makes projections based on the ‘triangulation’ technique AI has a power problem. While tech giants pour billions into development, they're hitting a wall that has nothing to do with chips, algorithms, or talent. The problem is fundamental: the electrical grid can't handle what's coming. The latest Prinsights linked below details why. pic.twitter.com/0L4JXJgebV — Nomi Prins (@nomiprins) May 28, 2025 De Vries-Gao made projections based on the supply chain for specialized computer chips used for AI as he and other researchers tried to understand AI’s energy consumption. The researchers discovered that AI’s energy appetite is growing fast enough to warrant more scrutiny despite efficiency gains. To figure this out, De Vries-Gao used what he called a “triangulation” technique. The researcher turned to publicly available device details, analyst estimates, and companies’ earnings calls to estimate hardware production for AI and how much energy that hardware is likely to use. De Vries-Gao calculated how specialized AI equipment could be produced and compared that to information about how much electricity these devices consumed. He found that last year, they likely burned through as much electricity as his home country of the Netherlands . “That’s how we know that both Google’s and Microsoft’s carbon footprints have grown in recent years as they focus on AI. But companies usually don’t break down the data to show what’s attributable to AI specifically.” – Alex de Vries-Gao , the founder of Digiconomist Last week, a separate report from consulting firm ICF forecasted a 25% rise in energy demand in the U.S. by the end of the decade, largely thanks to AI, traditional data centers, and Bitcoin mining. Another article published in MIT Technology Review last week, with support from the Tarbell Center for AI Journalism, claimed that it is still hard to make blanket predictions about AI’s energy consumption and the resulting environmental impact. Meta plans to power a giant AI data center with gas Meta announced in mid-May that it is building a new AI data center so large in Louisiana that the local utility company planned to set up three new gas-fired power plants to provide it with enough energy. However, advocates and lawmakers pressed Meta for answers about how it would clean up pollution from the data center’s energy consumption. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) wrote a letter to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on May 14 demanding answers about how much energy the data center would use. He also sought answers about the greenhouse gas emissions that would be generated. The letter pointed out that the gas-powered new data center flew in the face of Meta’s climate commitments. Sen. Whitehouse also stated that Meta’s backslide from its own climate pledges in 2020 risks triggering broader economic harm at a time when corporate responsibility is urgently needed. Logan Burke, the Executive Director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, claimed it is hard to figure out whether a facility like Meta’s is good or bad for communities without understanding the possible impact on electrical systems, bills, and water. However, Meta maintained that it will continue matching its electricity use with support for renewable energy, including a commitment to help fund 1,500 megawatts of new solar and battery resources in Louisiana.

2025-05-30T10:42:58.000Z,"Bitcoin (BTC) Benefits from Bullish Bets, Altcoins Punish the Optimists","While the collective crypto market has witnessed significant recovery this month, there is a growing disconnect in risk appetite among market participants. Investors are correctly positioned for Bitcoin’s rally, but similar optimism in the altcoin space has resulted in heavy losses, shows a recent report. Trader Missteps in Altcoins Since the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, there has been a notable divergence has emerged in the liquidation patterns of BTC and altcoins. Data from Binance reveals that the largest cryptocurrency experienced a dominance of short liquidations totaling $190 million. This trend, according to a new analysis by CryptoQuant, suggests that traders betting against BTC during its price appreciation were consistently forced to exit their positions as the market moved higher. On the other hand, the same cannot be said for altcoins. During the same period, long liquidations in altcoins surged to nearly $1 billion, which was indicative of a continued downward pressure across the broader altcoin market and failed bets on a widespread recovery. As such, the report stated this as a clear sign of liquidation asymmetry. While BTC’s rally led to short squeezes and upward momentum, altcoins saw traders punished for attempting to preempt an “Altseason” that never materialized. Since December 2024, this pattern has intensified, with altcoin liquidations consistently outpacing those of BTC. CryptoQuant attributed this to excessive leverage and misaligned market sentiment, as altcoin bulls were increasingly forced to unwind losing positions. Few Altcoin Gems Emerge as Market Lags Despite the broader underperformance in the altcoin market, some assets stand out. According to analyst Rekt Fencer, increased stablecoin liquidity, a dip in Bitcoin dominance, and a recovering ETH/BTC ratio point to rising investor appetite for altcoins. He named five altcoins – GRASS, PENDLE, ONDO, ENA, and SEI – that he predicts could surge 50x-100x if market momentum continues. These tokens represent strong narratives, including decentralized infrastructure, tokenized yields, real-world asset exposure, synthetic dollars, and high-speed DeFi ecosystems. Meanwhile, other altcoins such as Tron (TRX) have shown resilience, and experts expect it to “multiply significantly in value,” potentially even quadrupling, if Bitcoin continues its bull run through the rest of the year. Sui (SUI) is yet another crypto that has witnessed the emergence of a bullish sentiment.

Analysts look at rising open interest as a signal of growing demand. It suggests another leg up is likely. However, with factors such as profit taking and overall market conditions to consider, there’s the possibility that a negative flip could be inbound.

2025-05-30T10:30:47.000Z,"Navigating the Crypto Fear and Greed Index: Market Sentiment Holds Strong in ‘Greed’","BitcoinWorld Navigating the Crypto Fear and Greed Index: Market Sentiment Holds Strong in ‘Greed’ Are you trying to get a pulse on the unpredictable crypto market sentiment ? One of the most popular tools investors and traders use is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index . This index provides a snapshot of the prevailing emotional state in the cryptocurrency space, offering clues as to whether market participants are feeling overly cautious (fear) or excessively confident (greed). Understanding the Crypto Fear and Greed Index The Crypto Fear and Greed Index , developed by Alternative.me, aims to quantify the emotional state of the crypto market . Why is this important? Because extreme fear can signal a potential buying opportunity (when investors are irrationally selling), while extreme greed can indicate the market is due for a correction (when investors might be getting overly enthusiastic). The index operates on a simple scale from 0 to 100: 0-24: Extreme Fear 25-49: Fear 50-74: Greed 75-100: Extreme Greed As of May 30th, the index registered a reading of 60. While this is a notable drop of 14 points from the previous day’s reading, it firmly keeps the index within the ‘Greed’ zone. This suggests that despite a recent pullback in sentiment, the overall feeling among crypto participants remains positive and optimistic. What Factors Influence the Index? The index isn’t based on just one metric. It aggregates data from six key factors, each weighted differently to provide a comprehensive view of crypto market sentiment : Volatility (25%): Measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average corresponding values over the last 30 and 90 days. Higher volatility often indicates fear. Market Momentum / Volume (25%): Compares the current volume and market momentum (specifically for Bitcoin) with average values over the last 30 and 90 days. High buying volume in a positive market pushes the index towards greed. Social Media (15%): Analyzes posts on social media platforms (like Twitter) for specific crypto-related hashtags and assesses the speed and number of interactions. High positive engagement can signal greed. Surveys (15%): (Currently paused by the provider) Historically involved weekly polls to gauge investor sentiment directly. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Measures Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market cap. An increasing Bitcoin dominance can indicate fear (as investors move from altcoins to the perceived safety of BTC), while decreasing dominance can signal greed (as investors rotate into riskier altcoins). Google Trends (10%): Analyzes search query data related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Rising search interest, especially for terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” or “Bitcoin bubble,” can indicate fear. Decoding the Current ‘Greed’ Reading (60) A reading of 60 means that the collective data points from the factors above indicate a generally positive and optimistic outlook in the crypto market . People are more inclined to buy, hold, and perhaps take on more risk than they would during periods of fear. This level of crypto greed suggests confidence is present, but it’s not yet at the extreme levels (75+) that often precede significant pullbacks. The 14-point drop from the previous day is also noteworthy. While still in ‘Greed’, this decline suggests a slight cooling off in sentiment. This could be attributed to various factors like minor price corrections, specific news events, or just natural market fluctuations. It’s a reminder that sentiment is dynamic and can shift quickly. Navigating the ‘Greed’ Zone: Actionable Insights Being in the ‘Greed’ zone doesn’t automatically mean a market crash is imminent, but it does warrant caution. Here’s what investors and traders might consider: Stay Alert: ‘Greed’ markets can be prone to sharper pullbacks. Avoid making impulsive decisions based solely on positive sentiment. Review Positions: If you’ve made significant gains, consider taking some profits or adjusting stop-loss orders to protect your capital. Avoid FOMO: The fear of missing out (FOMO) is strongest during ‘Greed’ phases. Avoid buying assets solely because they are pumping; always do your own research. Combine Indicators: The Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index (which heavily influences the overall index) is just one tool. Use it in conjunction with technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and broader market news. Understand the Nuance: A reading of 60 is different from a reading of 85. While both are ‘Greed’, the latter signifies a much higher level of potential irrational exuberance. Limitations of the Index While valuable, the index is not a crystal ball. It’s a lagging or concurrent indicator of sentiment, not a predictive tool for price movements. It tells you how people are feeling *now*, but not necessarily what will happen next. It also doesn’t explain *why* sentiment is changing, which requires deeper market analysis. Conclusion: Sentiment Holds, But Watchful Eyes Remain The latest reading of the Crypto Fear and Greed Index confirms that overall crypto market sentiment remains positive, sitting comfortably in the ‘Greed’ zone at 60. However, the recent 14-point dip serves as a valuable reminder that market emotions can shift rapidly. While ‘Greed’ can indicate healthy market momentum, it also calls for prudent decision-making and a cautious approach to avoid potential pitfalls associated with excessive optimism. Keep using the index as one piece of your overall market analysis puzzle.

2025-05-30T10:27:11.000Z,"Paris Saint-Germain adds Bitcoin to balance sheet amid crypto boom in European football","Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), one of the most valuable football clubs in the world, has officially confirmed that it holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet. The announcement, made during the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, marks the first time a global sports team has publicly declared a strategic Bitcoin treasury allocation. Bitcoin Magazine @BitcoinMagazine · Follow JUST IN: European soccer giant Paris Saint Germain announces they adopted a #Bitcoin treasury reserve 🇫🇷 Watch on Twitter View replies 12:05 AM · May 30, 2025 7.9K Reply Copy link Read 237 replies PSG, with a fanbase exceeding 550 million, is now part of a growing group of corporations adding cryptocurrency to their financial reserves in response to shifting global trends and digital asset policy developments. Bitcoin allocation began in 2024 as part of treasury diversification According to Pär Helgosson, head of PSG Labs, the French football giant began acquiring Bitcoin last year using part of its fiat reserves. While the exact amount of Bitcoin held by PSG has not been disclosed, the allocation remains on the club’s books heading into the UEFA Champions League final next week in Munich. The move aligns with broader demographic trends, as the club reports that 80% of its fanbase is under the age of 34—a group widely associated with higher rates of crypto adoption. The Bitcoin initiative is also part of PSG’s push to position itself at the forefront of digital innovation. The club’s involvement in NFTs and fan tokens through its partnership with Socios.com had already laid the groundwork for its crypto strategy. The new Bitcoin holding adds a layer of long-term financial diversification as the club seeks new ways to hedge currency risk and tap into digital-native communities. Football leads crypto sponsorships with 64% annual growth PSG’s move comes at a time when football is experiencing a surge in crypto and digital asset partnerships. According to SportQuake’s latest industry data, football accounts for 43% of all crypto sponsorships across sports for the 2024/25 season. This represents a 64% year-on-year rise in total crypto-related sponsorships, driven largely by European leagues. Notably, 44% of all crypto football sponsorship deals are concentrated within Europe’s top five leagues, including Ligue 1, where PSG currently reigns as champions. Brands continue to prioritise global reach and international audiences, with non-US crypto spend playing a major role amid uncertainty around regulatory direction in the US under President Trump’s administration. Matt House, CEO of SportQuake, noted that this international expansion in crypto sponsorships is being fuelled by delays in US crypto clarity, as companies shift their focus to European markets for faster adoption opportunities. This is particularly evident in the concentration of activity across UEFA leagues. Global corporates accelerate Bitcoin adoption amid ETF boom PSG’s strategy is part of a broader corporate trend toward Bitcoin adoption, accelerated by regulatory developments and the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in multiple markets. The shift from viewing Bitcoin as a speculative asset to a corporate treasury strategy is gaining traction, especially after President Trump’s directive encouraging US federal institutions to explore Bitcoin reserves. Dom Harz, co-founder of Build on Bitcoin (BOB), attributes much of the momentum to ETFs and the emerging perception of Bitcoin as a stable digital asset with passive yield potential. He also pointed to the growing appetite among companies to diversify beyond traditional markets, citing digital assets as a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty and inflation risk. In the case of sports franchises like PSG, the visibility of such moves may influence others to follow suit—especially in regions where crypto regulation is clearer and adoption is higher. While American sports leagues have been slower to engage with crypto on a treasury level, European clubs are increasingly leveraging their global branding power to lead on financial innovation.

Despite this milestone, market behavior suggests this may not be the euphoric top—capital is still flowing in at unprecedented levels. Investor Confidence Remains Unshaken: $1.8B Daily Inflows Match 2021 Peak According to on-chain analyst Axel Adler Jr. , Bitcoin is now averaging around $1.8 billion in daily net inflows , comparable to the peaks last seen in the November 2021 bull market, when BTC hit $64,000. Adler, known for his data-driven insights shared on platforms like X (formerly Twitter), emphasizes that this volume of inflow is a strong indicator of sustained investor confidence , even after setting new all-time highs. Axel Adler Jr. on X “Daily net inflows remain historically high—even surpassing peak 2021 levels at current price points.” Capital Flows Strongest at High Price Points—Not the Dip Notably, Adler’s data reveals that capital surged most aggressively during price spikes—not dips. At $73,000 , Bitcoin saw $3.6 billion in daily inflows, while the figure jumped to $4.5 billion per day when BTC was around $92,000 . This is a significant shift from past market behavior where buying typically intensified during pullbacks. The current cycle shows growing comfort among investors to buy at higher levels, possibly reflecting institutional conviction rather than short-term speculation. Market Structure: A Breakout Followed by Consolidatio At the beginning of May, Bitcoin hovered around $94,181 , trading sideways in a narrow band. A sharp 6.42% surge on May 8 broke that pattern, launching a new phase of bullish momentum. From May 18 to May 22 , Bitcoin spiked over 8.3% , reaching its new high. However, a brief pullback followed: since May 23 , BTC has dropped approximately 5.8% , now trading at $105,171.54 . The retracement suggests a period of healthy consolidation rather than panic selling, especially considering broader macroeconomic stability and continued crypto ETF interest . Technical Indicators Show Ongoing Strength RSI (Relative Strength Index) : Currently at 53.58 , suggesting neutral momentum. It has held between 50 and 70 since late May, indicating consolidation without immediate overbought conditions. Golden Cross : On May 22 , the 50-day MA crossed above the 200-day MA —a bullish signal. The moving averages now stand at $97,776.48 and $94,668.91 respectively, with the gap widening, affirming strong trend momentum. ADX (Average Directional Index) : At 25.88 , it indicates a sustained trend strength. Since late April, the ADX has stayed above 25, further validating the current upward momentum. Looking Ahead: Beyond the ATH While the 5% weekly drop may seem alarming in isolation, zooming out reveals a 30-day gain of 11.1% . The volume of capital inflows, even at elevated price levels, underlines a shift in market psychology. Long-term investors appear increasingly comfortable entering the market at higher valuations, perhaps viewing Bitcoin as a macro-hedge rather than a volatile asset. Final Takeaway The new all-time high for Bitcoin is notable—but what matters more is the context behind it. Historical levels of capital inflow, strong technical signals, and a maturing investor base all point to a market that is evolving , not overheating. In the words of analyst Axel Adler Jr. , this may be the “ most structurally sound bull cycle yet .” .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-30T10:20:29.000Z,"Bitcoin Options Expiry: Gigantic $9.8B Event Looms for Crypto Market","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Options Expiry: Gigantic $9.8B Event Looms for Crypto Market Get ready, crypto traders! A significant event is on the horizon that could potentially inject some volatility into the market. We’re talking about the massive expiry of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) options contracts, set to happen on May 30th. This isn’t just a small blip; we’re looking at billions of dollars worth of contracts reaching their maturity date. Understanding what this means is crucial for anyone navigating the digital asset space right now. What is Happening with the Bitcoin Options Expiry? According to data from leading crypto options exchange Deribit, a staggering $9.8 billion worth of Bitcoin options contracts are scheduled to expire. This event is pegged for May 30th at 08:00 UTC. Options contracts give traders the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a specific price (the strike price) on or before a certain date (the expiry date). When this date arrives, the contracts either expire worthless, are exercised, or are settled based on the price of the underlying asset. The sheer scale of this Bitcoin options expiry is noteworthy. Nearly $10 billion in notional value represents a substantial portion of the open interest in the BTC options market. Large expiries like this are often watched closely by traders and analysts, as they can sometimes coincide with increased market activity or shifts in sentiment. Understanding the Put Call Ratio Crypto A key metric analysts look at ahead of an options expiry is the put/call ratio. This ratio compares the number of outstanding put options (bets on price going down) to the number of outstanding call options (bets on price going up). For the upcoming Bitcoin options expiry, the put/call ratio stands at 0.89. What does this tell us? A ratio below 1 indicates that there are more call options (bullish bets) than put options (bearish bets) outstanding. A ratio above 1 indicates more put options than call options. A ratio close to 1 suggests a relatively balanced market sentiment between bullish and bearish outlooks. The 0.89 ratio for BTC suggests a slight lean towards bullish sentiment among options traders for these specific contracts, though it’s still relatively close to parity, indicating a somewhat balanced positioning overall. Similarly, for the Ethereum options expiring on the same day, the put/call ratio is 0.82. This also indicates a slight preference for call options over put options among ETH options traders ahead of the expiry. Exploring the Max Pain Price Crypto Another fascinating concept tied to options expiry is the max pain price crypto . This is the strike price at which the largest number of options contracts (both puts and calls) will expire worthless. The theory behind max pain is that market makers and large participants who are on the other side of many of these contracts might have an incentive to manipulate the market price towards the max pain point as the expiry approaches, thereby maximizing their profits or minimizing their losses. For the $9.8 billion Bitcoin options expiry, the max pain price is currently calculated at a striking $100,000 . This is significantly higher than Bitcoin’s current trading price. For the $1.65 billion ETH options expiry, the max pain price is $2,300 , which is considerably lower than Ethereum’s current market value. It’s important to understand that the max pain theory is just one perspective and its influence is debated. The market is influenced by countless factors, and the price doesn’t always gravitate towards max pain. However, it remains a data point that options traders monitor. The ETH Options Expiry: A Concurrent Event While the focus is often on Bitcoin due to its market cap and the sheer volume of the expiry, it’s crucial not to overlook the concurrent Ethereum options expiry. Also happening on May 30th at 08:00 UTC, $1.65 billion worth of ETH options will mature. While smaller than the BTC expiry, this is still a substantial amount and represents significant open interest in Ethereum derivatives. As mentioned, the ETH put/call ratio is 0.82, indicating a slightly more pronounced bullish bias among ETH options holders compared to BTC. The max pain price for ETH is $2,300. This lower max pain price compared to the current market price suggests that, according to the max pain theory, significant value in ETH put options would expire worthless if the price were near $2,300, while many call options would also be out-of-the-money. Potential Impact on the Crypto Options Market and Beyond So, what could these massive expiries mean for the broader crypto options market and the spot prices of BTC and ETH? The impact is often a subject of much debate among analysts. Here are a few potential scenarios or considerations: Volatility Spike: Large expiries can sometimes lead to increased volatility in the hours leading up to and immediately following the event. Traders holding large positions might adjust their spot positions to hedge their options exposure, or market makers might rebalance their books. This activity can amplify price movements. Reduced Open Interest: Post-expiry, the total open interest in Bitcoin and Ethereum options will significantly decrease. This can sometimes lead to a temporary decrease in market depth or liquidity in the options market until new positions are opened. Max Pain Influence (Debated): As discussed, some believe the price might feel pressure towards the max pain point. Given the high max pain for BTC ($100k) and the low max pain for ETH ($2.3k) relative to current prices, this theory would imply different pressures, though the validity of this influence is highly contested, especially when max pain is far from the current price. Sentiment Reset: The expiry clears out existing options positions, allowing traders to open new contracts based on fresh market outlooks. This can sometimes lead to a ‘reset’ in market sentiment as reflected in the open interest and put/call ratios of the newly dominant contracts. Hedging Activities: Large holders of options contracts, particularly institutional players, often hedge their options positions with corresponding spot market trades. As options approach expiry, these hedges may be unwound or adjusted, potentially causing ripples in the spot market. It’s crucial to remember that the crypto market is influenced by a multitude of factors, including macroeconomic news, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and overall market sentiment. While a large options expiry is a notable event, it is just one piece of the complex puzzle. Key Takeaways for Traders and Investors Here’s a quick summary of the key points regarding the May 30th options expiry: Scale: $9.8B in BTC options and $1.65B in ETH options expiring is a significant event. Timing: May 30th at 08:00 UTC is the critical time. Sentiment (P/C Ratio): Slightly more calls than puts for both BTC (0.89) and ETH (0.82), indicating a mild bullish lean among options holders for these contracts. Max Pain: $100,000 for BTC and $2,300 for ETH. This is a theoretical price point and its influence is debated. Potential Impact: Could lead to increased volatility, especially around the expiry time. For those active in the market, staying informed and being prepared for potential price swings is always wise. Don’t rely solely on the max pain price or the expiry date as definitive market predictors. Instead, view this event as one of several factors influencing market dynamics. Conclusion: Watching the Clock on May 30th The upcoming May 30th expiry of nearly $10 billion in Bitcoin options and over $1.6 billion in Ethereum options is undoubtedly a major event on the crypto calendar. While the exact impact on price is always uncertain and subject to broader market conditions, the sheer size of the expiry, coupled with the insights from the put/call ratios and max pain prices, provides valuable data points for market participants. Traders will be watching closely to see how the market reacts as these significant contracts reach their conclusion. As always, exercising caution and managing risk are paramount in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies.

2025-05-30T10:17:09.000Z,"Panama City Proposes Bitcoin Payments for Priority Passage Through Panama Canal","Panama City Mayor Mayer Mizrachi has proposed an idea that could bring Bitcoin into one of the world’s most important trade routes. Speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas on May 29, Mizrachi floated the possibility of allowing cargo ships to pay in Bitcoin for faster passage through the Panama Canal. Panama Canal Could Accept Bitcoin for Priority Passage, Says Mayor Mizrachi spoke about the proposal during a panel discussion alongside El Salvador Bitcoin advisors Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert. AMAZING PANEL WITH MAX, STACY, MIKE, & PANAMA CITY MAYOR MIZRACHI pic.twitter.com/E5sqqHbZkJ — The Bitcoin Conference (@TheBitcoinConf) May 29, 2025 The session was moderated by Mike Peterson, director of Bitcoin Beach in El Salvador. “We have a canal — what if you get a perk for paying in Bitcoin, get your ship to go quicker if you pay in Bitcoin,” The Panama Canal is a critical shipping corridor that connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. It handles around 5% of all global maritime trade and saves ships from weeks of travel around South America. Nearly 10,000 vessels passed through the canal in the last fiscal year, transporting over 423 million tons of goods. The canal generated around $5 billion in revenue for Panama between October 2023 and September 2024, according to the Panama Canal website. The idea of accepting Bitcoin for canal fees comes amid growing political attention on the waterway. In December 2024, U.S. President Donald Trump proposed reclaiming control of the Panama Canal, citing concerns over Chinese influence and alleging unfair treatment of U.S. ships. Mizrachi’s comments reflect his broader push for Bitcoin adoption in public services. He has recently advocated for creating a Bitcoin reserve for Panama City and urged lawmakers to support a more open stance on crypto. Rather than rush into regulation, Mizrachi warned legislators to avoid interfering too soon with the growing crypto sector. “Don’t touch it, don’t get near it, don’t even look at it, let it operate, let it function,” he said. “Then decide what it needs. Do you want to restrict it or do you want to promote it?” The mayor also claimed that Bitcoin use in Panama is more widespread than it appears, estimating over $5 billion in annual transactions. But much of the activity, he said, happens quietly due to fear and lack of public support. Mizrachi’s Bitcoin-for-passage proposal is still conceptual, but it indicates Panama City’s growing interest in blockchain innovation and financial alternatives in global trade. Panama City Eyes Bitcoin Reserve Amid Growing Ties with El Salvador Following Panama City’s move to propose Bitcoin payments for priority canal passage, the city’s pro-Bitcoin stance appears to be deepening. Mayor Mayer Mizrachi has hinted at the possibility of creating a Bitcoin reserve after meeting with Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert, two key figures behind El Salvador’s Bitcoin strategy. Panama City Mayor @Mayer has sparked speculation about creating a Bitcoin reserve after meeting with two of El Salvador’s Bitcoin strategists. #Panama #Bitcoin https://t.co/rNM6EM37pz — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 17, 2025 Shortly after their May 16 meeting, Mizrachi posted “Bitcoin Reserve” on X, fueling speculation. Though no official proposal has been introduced, the timing aligns with his upcoming appearance at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas. Panama City has already made crypto history this year, allowing residents to pay taxes and municipal fees in BTC, ETH, USDT, and USDC since April. The city instantly converts these payments into USD through a local bank. Mizrachi has drawn comparisons to cities like Lugano and states like Colorado, signaling his ambition to align Panama City with other crypto-forward regions. However, any move to establish a formal Bitcoin reserve would require legislative approval from the National Assembly. Keiser noted their discussions touched on mining, financial education, and Panama’s hydroelectric potential. Herbert added that Panama City will integrate El Salvador’s “What is Money?” Bitcoin textbook into its online public library system.

Here's the Amount of XRP They Will Buy!","Despite the bans on Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies in China, interest in BTC and altcoins remains high. At this point, an important move came from a Chinese company. Webus International Limited, a China-based company that provides AI-powered mobility solutions, will raise up to $300 million to create a Ripple (XRP) reserve for global payments. According to the official statement, Webus announced that it plans to raise up to $300 million in non-capital financing to create an XRP reserve. The company also said it has renewed its partnership with Tongcheng Travel Holdings Ltd., one of China's largest online travel platforms. The $300 million funding strategy for the XRP reserve will consist of a mix of existing cash reserves, bank loans, shareholder guarantees, and institutional credit support from traditional banks. However, the company did not specify a timeline for the XRP purchase. Nan Zheng, Chief Executive Officer of Webus, said: “These strategic developments have the potential to create strong synergies between our domestic and international operations, “While our renewed partnership with Tongcheng strengthens our China network infrastructure, an XRP integration has the potential to revolutionize the way we handle cross-border payments for both partners and travelers worldwide.” Webus’ statement comes a day after Nasdaq-listed energy company VivoPower International announced its $121 million strategy to establish its own XRP treasury.

According to CoinMarketCap data on May 30, the overall crypto market cap dropped from $3.45 trillion to $3.32 trillion, a 3.77% decline. Crypto market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap Bitcoin , the market’s bellwether, is now trading just above $105,000, down 3% on the day. Altcoins have been hit even harder. XRP has slipped 4% erasing $6 billion , Solana is down roughly 5%, and Dogecoin has led the declines in the top 10 digital assets by market worth with a 9% drop. Cryptocurrency market pullback amid uncertainty Short-term momentum has clearly shifted, and several major assets are now testing key support levels. Risk-off sentiment appears to have gripped traders amid macro uncertainty and renewed concerns over near-term crypto inflows. However, this sell-off hasn’t erased the strong gains seen over the past quarter, Bitcoin remains firmly above its 200-day moving average and is still up significantly year-to-date. While the broader trend for Bitcoin and select large-caps remains upward on higher time frames, today’s drop underscores how quickly sentiment can shift in the current market. With June around the corner and several token unlocks and macro events on the radar, short-term caution may continue to dominate.

2025-05-30T09:50:03.000Z,"Who’s Buying Access to Trump? Jamie Raskin Demands Guest List of $TRUMP Coin Dinner","The post Who’s Buying Access to Trump? Jamie Raskin Demands Guest List of $TRUMP Coin Dinner appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A heated controversy is brewing in Washington as Rep. Jamie Raskin pushes President Donald Trump to reveal the full list of guests who attended a private dinner after purchasing $TRUMP memecoins. These attendees reportedly spent close to $400 million just to get access. This demand comes during the Bitcoin 2025 Conference in Las Vegas , where major crypto figures like Vice President JD Vance, Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, the Winklevoss twins, and pardoned Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht are promoting the administration’s strong pro-crypto stance. Jamie Raskin Calls for Transparency: Who Bought Their Way In? In a letter sent Thursday, Raskin pressed President Trump to disclose the names of all 220 buyers who used $TRUMP coins to secure a spot at the private dinner. He pointed out that many of these buyers appear to be foreign nationals who only purchased the coins after the event was announced. “These 220 buyers…collectively spent hundreds of millions of dollars — $394 million by one account,” said Raskin, noting that “we deserve to know who is paying for access to our president.” He also expressed serious concerns that the event may break laws regarding foreign government payments, known as emoluments laws. Raskin demanded full disclosure of the sources of funds each attendee used to purchase the coins and set a deadline of June 4, 2025, for this information. The Focus on Justin Sun and Potential Foreign Influence One high-profile figure in the spotlight is Chinese-born crypto investor Justin Sun. He reportedly spent $23 million on $TRUMP coins . Sun has previously faced investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for his connections to a Trump-related crypto firm. Raskin warned that some of the funds may come from illegal sources or foreign governments, raising red flags about possible foreign influence through cryptocurrency. He was clear about what the public should know: beyond “virtually worthless memecoins,” what exactly are these buyers getting in return for their millions? .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Inside Trump’s Gala Dinner: Fancy Watches Worth $100000, Three-course Meal And More , Crypto, Politics, and a Growing Scrutiny This controversy unfolds at a critical moment for cryptocurrency in the U.S. The Trump administration’s aggressive push to embrace crypto, showcased at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference, marks a significant shift in policy. However, Raskin’s demands highlight the ongoing concerns about foreign money mixing with political power through digital assets.

ONDO partners with JPMorgan, Circle, and BlackRock in RWA. Ethereum upgrade drops fees, boosts sentiment despite price dip. With Bitcoin recently soaring past $110,000 and hitting a new all-time high, one big question is circling the crypto market: when will altcoins finally catch up? ? Historically, every time Bitcoin leads the charge, it eventually sparks a wave of activity across altcoins — and many believe that moment is approaching fast. However, the mood in the market has shifted over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin and several major altcoins slipped into the red following fresh tariff-related uncertainty in the US. But it’s not all bad news — Bitcoin is still holding firmly above the key $104,000 support level, and with altcoins down by around 2-6%, this pullback might actually be a golden opportunity for investors eyeing the next big move. With Bitcoin now just 3-5% away from setting a new all-time high, history suggests an altcoin rally could soon follow.

2025-05-30T09:44:12.000Z,"Panama city eyes Bitcoin fees for canal ships","Panama City Mayor Mayer Mizrachi has proposed granting priority access to ships that pay transit fees using Bitcoin. This initiative aims to integrate cryptocurrency into the canal’s operations, potentially offering a more efficient payment method for expedited passage. Mizrachi shared this idea on May 29 while speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas alongside other Bitcoin supporters from El Salvador. Panama City Mayor proposes Bitcoin payments for priority canal transit Mizrachi spoke on the panel alongside Bitcoin advocates, El Salvador government advisors Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert, and moderator Mike Peterson from Bitcoin Beach. He suggested that cargo ships waiting to pass through the Panama Canal can pay their transit fees in Bitcoin and get priority access. The mayor pointed out that this idea could position Panama as a leading digital finance and technology center and bring Bitcoin deeper into the country’s economy. The Panama Canal saves cargo ships weeks of travel time that they would have to spend if they sailed around the southern tip of South America because it links the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. The canal handles about 5% of all global maritime commerce, and nearly 10,000 ships passed through it between October 2023 and September 2024, carrying more than 423 million tons of cargo and generating almost $5 billion in revenue for Panama. Mizrachi’s idea comes at a time of political tension since President Donald Trump publicly demanded that the United States take back control of the Panama Canal in December 2024. Trump criticized the toll system by claiming that U.S. ships pay higher fees than ships from other countries and argued that China’s growing influence over the canal threatens American interests. The mayor’s idea to accept Bitcoin payments for faster canal transit in this complicated situation supports Panama’s digital growth goals. It makes the canal more competitive and efficient on the international trade stage. Panama City embraces Bitcoin for tax payments and proposes City-level crypto reserve Panama City approved a new rule that allows people and businesses to pay their municipal taxes, fines, and fees using Bitcoin and other digital currencies. This move shows that the city trusts digital currency and wants to give people more flexible ways to meet their financial obligations to the government. Mayor Mizrachi also proposed to create a dedicated Bitcoin reserve for Panama City to help stabilize its finances and attract new investment opportunities since the city contributes more than half of the country’s gross domestic product. He also said he could set up the reserve at the city level without waiting for the national legislature to pass any new laws. The mayor used strong language to warn lawmakers to avoid rushing into new rules that could slow progress or scare away innovation. He said, “Don’t touch it, don’t get near it, don’t even look at it,” emphasizing that the government should give Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies the space to grow naturally. Mizrachi told lawmakers to watch how people use Bitcoin over time and only bring rules that protect users or improve systems. Mizrachi said the country transacts over $5 billion in Bitcoin annually, but most of it remains hidden because many fear the legal or social risks of being open about their involvement with crypto. The mayor believes that making the system more open, transparent, and officially supported will encourage more people and businesses to come forward. The decision to adopt Bitcoin also comes amidst social and economic tension. Panama declared a state of emergency in the Bocas del Toro province following news that a well-known banana company, Chiquita, was laying off over 5,000 workers. Those employees were demonstrating for additional social security guarantees and improved working conditions.

2025-05-30T09:31:07.000Z,"India’s Crypto Regulation Policy Coming in June: What We Know So Far","The post India’s Crypto Regulation Policy Coming in June: What We Know So Far appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News India might finally be ready to make a real move on crypto and the global industry is watching. After years of uncertainty, the government is preparing to release a discussion paper on crypto regulation in June. For a country that’s gone from heavy taxes to long periods of silence, this could be a defining moment. With the global market heating up and Bitcoin recently touching a new all-time high above $111,900 , India’s timing is interesting. What’s in the paper? Will it invite public opinion? Could this be the start of a more structured approach to crypto in India? Let’s unpack what we know so far. Supreme Court Steps In: Silence is No Longer an Option The pressure isn’t just coming from the markets. India’s Supreme Court has strongly called out the government’s delay in addressing crypto regulation. It warned that the ongoing legal vacuum is creating space for misuse and made it clear that banning crypto isn’t the solution. A bench led by Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh questioned why, while other global economies are moving ahead with their own regulatory frameworks, India is yet to make a clear decision. This paper appears to be a direct response. According to reports, the government’s upcoming proposal will draw heavily from the IMF and Financial Stability Board’s recent synthesis report. There are also signs that it might open the floor for public input, giving stakeholders a chance to contribute to the process. India’s Journey So Far: Tax First, Clarity Later India’s crypto story has had its share of growing pains. The 2023 budget introduced a 30% tax on crypto profits, which pushed many users and exchanges to rethink their presence in the country. While firms were required to register with the Financial Intelligence Unit, the sector still lacks formal recognition. The Reserve Bank of India has remained cautious, often highlighting risks like money laundering and terror financing. At the same time, it has continued to promote its central bank digital currency as a safer alternative to private crypto assets. According to a recent report by think tank Esya Centre , nearly 90% of Indian crypto trading has moved offshore, largely in response to existing policies. Industry voices have warned that the current setup limits innovation and drives users toward unregulated platforms. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Regulations in India 2025 , Global Momentum Is Building – Can India Keep Pace? While India works through its roadmap, global powers are setting the tone. In the US, President Donald Trump has shifted the country’s stance with a bold pro-crypto approach . His administration has pardoned several digital asset leaders, backed a strategic bitcoin reserve, and seen the Senate pass stablecoin-focused legislation. Meanwhile, the European Union is already rolling out its MiCA regulation , setting clear rules for digital asset firms operating across its member states. A Defining Moment for India One senior Indian official noted that the country would approach crypto decisions with the national interest in mind, and avoid “knee-jerk” reactions.

2025-05-30T09:30:27.000Z,"Bitcoin MVRV Ratio Signals Price Hot, But Not In Danger Zone Yet","On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio is getting high, but still outside this extreme territory. Bitcoin MVRV Ratio Yet To Surpass +1 SD Line In its latest weekly report, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how Bitcoin is currently looking from the perspective of the MVRV Ratio. The “MVRV Ratio” is a popular indicator that, in short, tells us about how the value held by the investors as a whole compares against their initial investment. Related Reading: Toncoin Open Interest Spikes 33%—Will History Repeat With A Pullback? When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means the holders are carrying more than they put in. In other words, they are in a state of net profit. On the other hand, the indicator being under the threshold suggests the overall network is underwater. The analytics firm has used the MVRV Ratio to define pricing bands that correspond to extreme deviations from the average investor profitability (that is, the mean value of the MVRV Ratio). These bands help point out periods where investor profits/losses are unusually high. Below is the chart shared by Glassnode in the report that shows the trend in these pricing bands for Bitcoin over the last few years. As displayed in the graph, the Bitcoin price has been trading above the mean level of this model since a while now. Recently, the asset has also broken above the +0.5 standard deviations (SD) line. This line corresponds to the price at which the MVRV Ratio attains a value that’s 0.5 standard deviations above the all-time mean. At present, the level is situated around $100,200. The level that BTC is yet to surpass in this latest rally is the +1 SD one, located at $119,400. From the chart, it’s visible that the cryptocurrency breaking above this line has generally led to a top for its price. The explanation behind this pattern lies in the fact that the larger investor profits grow, the more tempted holders become to take them. At extreme deviations of the MVRV Ratio, selling pressure from holders giving in to this temptation becomes significant, hence why the asset approaches a long-term top. In the current cycle, Bitcoin has breached the +1 SD level of the model on two occasions, ending up with the formations of the March 2024 and December 2024 peaks. For now, the current rally is still below this level, but above the +0.5 SD that also corresponds to a significant level of gains. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Trapped Inside Triangle: 17% Move Incoming? “This suggests the market is relatively heated, but arguably still has room for further expansion before the unrealized profit held by investors reaches an extreme level above +1σ,” explains the analytics firm.

2025-05-30T09:28:09.000Z,"Attention: There's an $11.4 Billion Options Earthquake in Bitcoin and Ethereum Today! Here Are the Critical Levels to Watch!","The leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) fell to the level of $106,000 after breaking a new record by exceeding $111,000 last week. While this decline has made the markets nervous about the risk of further declines, the expiration date for option contracts in the crypto market has come today, as it does every Friday. These options are even more important because they fall on the last Friday of both the week and the month. According to the news of Singapore-based crypto options data platform Greeks.live, 93 thousand Bitcoin (BTC) and 624 thousand Ethereum (ETH) options will expire on May 30 on the Deribit derivatives exchange. Accordingly, the Put/Call Ratio of BTC options is 0.89, the maximum loss point is $ 100,000 and the notional value is $ 9.79 billion. When we look at Ethereum, ETH options have a Put/Call Ratio of 0.81, a maximum loss point of $2,300, and a notional value of $1.62 billion. Related News: Surprise Country with Binance Founder CZ as Advisor Announces They Will Establish Bitcoin (BTC) Reserve! \""Thank You USA!\"" Analysts stated that Bitcoin has been following a volatile course this week, and that Ethereum is stronger compared to BTC. While the Pull/Call ratios show that the market is slightly optimistic in anticipation of a price increase, the Maximum Loss levels ($100,000 for BTC, $2,300 for ETH) carry the risk that prices could be pulled back to these levels. Analysts stated that price fluctuations may occur in BTC and ETH based on these rates. “Bitcoin has been mostly volatile this week, Ether has been relatively strong and the accumulation has been ongoing for two weeks. Data suggests that the market is still optimistic about BTC reaching new highs in the near future. ETH’s upward shock has started to slow down and the market has recalibrated ETH’s price and volatility. “Deliveries are less than 8% of total positions, a decline, and crypto institutions are not showing much reaction to new highs in Ethereum. This suggests low expectations for a near-term rally in ETH and more expectations for a steady, moderate increase.” May 30 Options Data 93,000 BTC options expired with a Put Call Ratio of 0.89, a Maxpain point of $100,000 and a notional value of $9.79 billion. 624,000 ETH options expired with a Put Call Ratio of 0.81, a Maxpain point of $2,300 and a notional value of $1.62 billion.

In January 2024, the crypto OTC infrastructure firm Finery Markets reported that institutional OTC volumes jumped 106% last year.Cointelegraph approached Hidden Road for comment regarding the estimated OTC volumes globally and in the US, but had not received a response by the time of publication.Rising institutional demandIn December 2024, Higgins highlighted a rising demand for institutional balance sheets from large institutions in an interview with Finance Magnates.“Servicing them [institutional investors] across traditional finance and digital asset ecosystems that have already converged presents a really unique opportunity for us in the marketplace.”Hidden Road’s OTC swap launch in the US marks one of the first products launched by the firm since the company entered a definitive agreement to be acquired by Ripple.Related: Taurus, Parfin partnership to provide crypto infrastructure to institutionsSoon after the deal was announced, Hidden Road received a broker-dealer license from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, a private US corporation and self-regulatory organization regulating member brokerage firms and exchange markets.Hidden Road is also known as one of the first companies to receive a Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) license in Europe, immediately after the framework entered into full force on Dec. 30, 2024.

2025-05-29T13:30:00.000Z,"How African innovators are using blockchain to solve real problems","While blockchain headlines in the West often focus on speculation and regulation, in Africa, it’s a different story, one rooted in necessity, innovation and grassroots adoption. The latest episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast explores this ground-up revolution with Kevin Imani, head of StarkWare’s Africa Venture Studio, who shares how communities across the continent are using blockchain to tackle real-world problems in finance, energy and connectivity.A student movement“Young students were using blockchain before it was mainstream,” Imani explained. From Kenya to Nigeria, local needs, not hype, drove early adoption. In many cases, it was students receiving digital currencies from abroad or freelancers getting paid in dollars and struggling to convert funds into local currency. With limited banking infrastructure or trust in government institutions, decentralized alternatives offered a lifeline.Imani highlighted how centralized systems like Kenya’s E-Mpesa changed access to finance, but still fall short for international payments or off-ramping digital assets. Related: Blockchain.com expands in Africa as local crypto rules take shape“You have to start becoming a trader almost,” he said, describing the convoluted process of converting stablecoins or crypto earnings into usable local funds. This trust gap has fueled peer-to-peer crypto usage. “These were kids holding stablecoins not to spend them, but to store value.” Even before regulators or startups built formal infrastructure, communities had already found use cases for blockchain.Blockchain beyond finance Beyond finance, African innovators are tapping blockchain to address energy insecurity. In rural Zambia, excess power from a mini hydro station could go to waste. Instead, residents can now use that surplus to mine Bitcoin, for example, generating revenue and creating a sustainable power loop. “It’s self-sustaining and reduces waste,” Imani said.Connectivity is another frontier. In areas where traditional internet providers fall short, decentralized WiFi hotspot networks are emerging. With blockchain, community members can share bandwidth and be compensated instantly and transparently. “You don’t need a middleman. It’s fair and trackable,” he said.Still, mainstream adoption remains cautious. Governments like those in Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa are in “standby mode,” focused more on consumer protection than full-scale implementation. But Imani remains optimistic: “The need is there. The technology is here. The only question is how we bridge that gap.”To hear the full conversation on The Clear Crypto Podcast, listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

2025-05-29T13:23:06.000Z,"Tim Berners-Lee says internet DNS should have been more decentralized","World Wide Web and hypertext markup language (HTML) inventor Tim Berners-Lee said that if he were building a domain name service (DNS) today, he would make it “more decentralized.”Speaking at ETH Prague on stage alongside Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, Berners-Lee reflected on early internet architecture decisions.“If I could go back […] I would make it more decentralized,“ he said.DNS was invented in 1983 by Paul Mockapetris, replacing the previous hosts.txt file-based system with a scalable, distributed system for naming IP addresses. Still, while Berners-Lee was not personally responsible for DNS development, he could have opted for a URL structure not tied to the DNS we know today, or he could have pushed for a decentralized alternative. Source: Mely.ethRelated: Decentralized naming could bring ‘next billion’ users to BitcoinCentralization of the DNSThe DNS system is highly centralized, particularly at its top levels of hierarchy. The root zone, which governs top-level domains such as .com and .org, is managed by the US-based nonprofit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).Furthermore, the most authoritative servers are operated by a handful of organizations, further centralizing the system. This allows for easy censorship and control by governments that can unilaterally seize or block domain names.This degree of centralization also makes outages due to centralized service disruption more likely. Control over root zones and domain policies is also concentrated in a few regions and among a select group of stakeholders.There are also concerns regarding privacy because centralized DNS queries can be monitored, logged and intercepted by internet service providers and other intermediaries.Related: Community split on ENS petition against Unstoppable Domains patentCrypto’s solution to the problemDecentralized alternatives to the DNS system are being developed. The most well-known is the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), which maps human-readable names to Ethereum addresses, content on the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS), or other data.Another alternative is Unstoppable Domains. Its system mints domains as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Ethereum and Polygon.ENS has seen a fair share of adoption. In late 2024, ENS Labs also partnered with PayPal and Venmo, sparking speculation about how this partnership is likely to boost mainstream adoption.IPFS runs on Ethereum smart contracts and aims to be user-owned and censorship-resistant. Currently, it is primarily used in Web3 applications, wallets and decentralized websites.Another alternative is Handshake (HNS), which aims to be a decentralized and permissionless naming protocol that is compatible with traditional DNS. A project with a similar aim is Namecoin (NMC), an early Bitcoin fork designed specifically to offer .bit domains and store DNS records onchain with censorship resistance.IPFS is also accompanied by its own Inter-Planetary Name System (IPNS), which enables mutable naming for IPFS addresses (hashes). URLs generated this way point to specific content, not servers.A non-crypto alternative to DNS is OpenNIC. This is a user-run project that offers non-ICANN domains, aiming to decentralize control through community governance.Magazine: Move to Portugal to become a crypto digital nomad — Everybody else is",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/tim-berners-lee-says-dns-should-have-been-more-decentralized?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

In a May 29 X post, Aave founder Stani Kulechov said the foundation borrowed $2 million in GHO tokens. “The EF is not only supplying ETH to Aave, but also borrowing from Aave,” Kulechov wrote, describing the development as “the full DeFi circle.”GHO is a decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin native to the Aave Protocol. Unlike centralized stablecoins, GHO is governed by Aave’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which oversees interest rates, collateral requirements and facilitator selection. The move highlights the EF’s growing engagement with the DeFi ecosystem, moving toward more sophisticated treasury strategies. The foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Source: Stani KulechovEthereum Foundation previously deployed $120 million in DeFiThe foundation’s move to borrow GHO follows a previous $120 million deployment into various protocols, signaling a shift in how it manages its crypto holdings. In February, the EF deployed 45,000 Ether (ETH) across different DeFi protocols, including Aave, Spark and Compound. At the time, the Ether was worth $120 million. Kulechov previously described the fund deployment as the foundation’s “biggest allocation in DeFi.” Because of the move, the Aave founder said that DeFi will win, expressing optimism as the EF added liquidity to the protocol.Apart from Kulechov, community members also celebrated the move, supporting the EF’s ETH holdings management shift. A community member said the development was a win, saying the foundation should “keep it up,” while an X user said it would be positive if the EF continued to use their funds this way. Related: Ethereum Foundation unveils security initiative to supplant legacy systemsCriticisms of the foundation selling Ether In January, Ethereum community members called on the foundation to explore alternatives to selling ETH for operational funding. The community suggested DeFi tools like staking and borrowing stablecoins against ETH. Eric Conner, co-author of EIP-1559, criticized the ETH selling, saying that the foundation’s primary use case seemed to be dumping its holdings. He called the practice “insane,” urging the EF to stake or use DeFi instead of selling. Anthony Sassano, host of The Daily Gwei, proposed that the EF stake part of its ETH and sell the staking rewards.

We’re re-architecting everything,” said Donut founder and CEO Chris Zhu. “We’re reconstructing the front end of the internet to be hyper-financialized for AI agents.”  Donut closes $7 million pre-seed round.

Mainstream browsers will also integrate agentic capabilities or build interoperability with purpose-built agentic browsers as AI becomes cheaper, according to Zhu.However, the most significant adoption will come within the next decade when onchain and offchain environments will be completely merged for internet users, Zhu said, adding:“Agentic browsers are poised to become the default entry point — much like smartphones replaced feature phones.”In the long term, Donut aims to support payments, gaming, content creation and social interaction, all within a single crypto-native browser. The company also plans to leverage advancements in decentralized identity and confidential computing to turn the browser into a personal “crypto CFO” for retail users.

2025-05-29T11:27:41.000Z,"Solana signals 40% crash vs. Ethereum amid cooling memecoin craze","Key takeaways: SOL/ETH has broken below a rising wedge pattern, signaling a potential 40% decline.Solana’s memecoin revenue has collapsed since April, weakening its core value proposition.Standard Chartered warns Solana may underperform as Ethereum’s L2 ecosystem grows more competitive.Solana’s (SOL) multiyear outperformance against Ethereum’s native token, Ether (ETH), is losing momentum, with technical breakdowns and weakening onchain activity pointing to a potential sharp decline in the SOL/ETH pair next.SOL enters rising wedge breakdown stageAs of May 29, the SOL/ETH pair has confirmed a breakdown from its multimonth rising wedge pattern, a bearish structure that often precedes significant declines.In technical terms, a rising wedge breakdown typically results in a drop equal to the pattern’s maximum height. SOL/ETH weekly price chart. Source: TradingViewFor SOL/ETH, this projects a downside target for July, near 0.038 ETH, representing a 40% decline from current levels.The 50-week exponential moving average (50-week EMA; the red wave) around 0.0628 ETH is offering interim support. A decisive weekly close below this level would likely confirm the bearish continuation toward the 0.038 ETH target.A bounce, on the other hand, could have SOL reclaim the wedge’s lower trendline as support, which may delay the breakdown scenario. Breaking above the wedge’s upper trendline will likely invalidate the 40% crash setup altogether.Cooling memecoin frenzy hints at SOL/ETH crashThe breakdown in SOL/ETH aligns with a visible decline in memecoin-driven activity on Solana. A key indicator is Pump.fun, the largest memecoin launch platform on the network, which shows a sharp drop in daily fee revenue since early April. Daily fees peaked in Q1 2025 but have since fallen to near-yearly lows, signaling reduced speculative activity on the chain, according to Dune Analytics.Pump.Fun fee and revenue chart. Source: Dune AnalyticsThe platform had been a major contributor to Solana's revenue growth, especially between December 2024 and March 2025. During this period, total cumulative fees surged past 3 million SOL as retail traders flooded the network to launch and trade meme tokens. These metrics have crashed ever since, weakening one of Solana's primary value drivers.A May 27 report from Standard Chartered further reinforces the downside narrative. The bank warned that Solana may underperform if it cannot diversify beyond memecoins, which currently dominate its transaction activity. Solana's decentralized exchange volume.
