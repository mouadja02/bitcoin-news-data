2025-05-29T23:55:54.000Z,"Crypto Market Cap Explodes Past $3.5T Driven by Institutional Demand","BitcoinWorld Crypto Market Cap Explodes Past $3.5T Driven by Institutional Demand Get ready for some significant news from the world of digital assets! The global crypto market cap has recently soared past an incredible milestone, exceeding $3.5 trillion. This isn’t just a number; it reflects a massive influx of capital and growing confidence in the digital asset space. What’s behind this surge? According to the on-chain analytics experts at Sentora (formerly known as IntoTheBlock), a major catalyst is the increasing institutional demand . What’s Fueling the Crypto Market Cap Surge? The headline figure of the crypto market cap crossing the $3.5 trillion threshold is certainly attention-grabbing. Sentora’s report highlights that while the entire ecosystem is contributing, the primary engine driving this recent growth is the significant interest and investment coming from large institutions. Bitcoin’s Role: A large part of this institutional focus is centered around Bitcoin . With the advent of regulated investment products like spot Bitcoin ETFs in various jurisdictions, traditional finance players now have easier, more familiar avenues to gain exposure to the leading cryptocurrency. Capital Influx: Institutions manage vast sums of capital. Even a small allocation from a large pension fund, hedge fund, or corporate treasury can represent hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars flowing into the market, disproportionately impacting the overall crypto market cap . Validation and Confidence: Institutional involvement often lends an air of legitimacy and maturity to an asset class. Their participation signals to other large players, and even sophisticated retail investors, that the market is becoming more established and less speculative than in its earlier days. Beyond Bitcoin: Strength in the Broader Ecosystem While Bitcoin might be leading the charge in terms of institutional flows, Sentora’s data reveals that the health of the crypto ecosystem extends far beyond just the king coin. The broader landscape is showing robust signs of recovery and growth, indicating increasing utility and adoption. DeFi’s Rebound: Decentralized Finance ( DeFi ) is seeing a significant resurgence. Sentora noted that DeFi loan books have rebounded to an impressive $30 billion. This metric is a key indicator of activity and confidence within decentralized lending, borrowing, and trading protocols. The recovery here suggests users are actively engaging with decentralized applications again after previous market downturns. Stablecoins’ Steadfast Growth: Stablecoins , digital currencies pegged to stable assets like the US dollar, have also seen remarkable growth. Sentora’s report points out a substantial 56% increase in their capitalization over the past year. This growth is crucial as stablecoins act as the primary medium of exchange within the crypto ecosystem, facilitating trading, lending, and payments without needing to constantly convert back to fiat currency. Their expanding market cap reflects increased activity and liquidity across the entire space. How is Regulation Shaping the Future? The evolving regulatory landscape in the United States is playing an increasingly important role in the crypto narrative, particularly concerning DeFi and stablecoins . Sentora highlighted that guidance and potential regulations from key bodies like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) are poised to significantly shape the future trajectory of these sectors. Clarity for Institutions: Regulatory clarity is often cited as a major hurdle for institutions considering deeper involvement in crypto. Clear rules around classification (is an asset a security or a commodity?), trading, and custody can provide the certainty large compliance departments require. Defining DeFi: Regulators are grappling with how to oversee decentralized protocols. Future guidance could impact how DeFi operates, potentially affecting everything from user interfaces to the underlying smart contracts. While some fear over-regulation, clear guidelines could also legitimize certain activities and attract more mainstream users and capital. Stablecoin Frameworks: Given their role in facilitating transactions and their potential to scale, stablecoins are under intense scrutiny. Proposed regulations aim to ensure their stability and prevent their use in illicit activities. A robust regulatory framework for stablecoins could pave the way for their wider adoption in payments and traditional finance. While regulatory developments can introduce uncertainty in the short term, many market participants view thoughtful regulation as a necessary step towards the long-term maturity and sustainability of the digital asset market. Benefits and Challenges of Increased Institutional Adoption The surge in institutional demand bringing the crypto market cap to new heights comes with both significant benefits and potential challenges: Benefits: Increased Liquidity: More institutional capital means deeper markets, making it easier to buy and sell assets without causing significant price swings. Reduced Volatility: Institutional trading strategies are often less emotional and short-term focused than retail, potentially leading to more stable market movements over time. Enhanced Legitimacy: Their participation validates crypto as a serious asset class, attracting further investment and talent. Infrastructure Development: Institutions require sophisticated tools and services, driving innovation in custody, trading platforms, and data analytics. Challenges: Centralization Concerns: Large pools of institutional capital could potentially lead to greater centralization of power and influence within certain protocols or assets. Market Manipulation Risks: While regulations aim to prevent this, large players could potentially exert undue influence on market prices. Regulatory Hurdles: The very regulations designed to attract institutions can also impose restrictions that impact the decentralized nature of some crypto projects, particularly in DeFi . Correlation with Traditional Markets: Increased institutional involvement could lead to crypto markets becoming more correlated with traditional finance, potentially reducing its diversification benefits. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Enthusiast What does this mean for you, the individual interested in or invested in crypto? The market reaching a $3.5 trillion crypto market cap driven by institutional demand is a strong signal of maturation. It suggests that digital assets are increasingly being viewed not just as speculative bets, but as legitimate components of global financial portfolios. Keep an eye on how regulatory discussions progress, as they will significantly impact the operational landscape for DeFi and stablecoins . Understanding the difference between assets primarily driven by retail vs. those attracting institutional interest (like Bitcoin ) can also be key to navigating market dynamics. Conclusion: A New Era for Digital Assets? Sentora’s latest data paints a clear picture: the crypto market is experiencing a period of significant growth, propelled by the increasing appetite from institutional investors, particularly for Bitcoin . This influx of sophisticated capital, coupled with the robust recovery seen in sectors like DeFi and the expanding utility of stablecoins , underscores the ecosystem’s resilience and evolving nature. As regulatory frameworks begin to solidify, they promise to further shape this burgeoning market. The journey to $3.5 trillion is a testament to the growing acceptance and integration of digital assets into the global financial fabric, potentially ushering in a new era for crypto.

2025-05-29T23:45:07.000Z,"Urgent: US GDP Contraction Signals Headwinds for Crypto Market","BitcoinWorld Urgent: US GDP Contraction Signals Headwinds for Crypto Market Attention crypto investors! While the headlines might seem focused purely on traditional finance, the latest economic data out of the United States holds significant clues for the future direction of the crypto market. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis recently released its second estimate for the first quarter of 2025, and the numbers caught many by surprise. Decoding the Latest US GDP Numbers So, what exactly did the data show? The report indicated that the US GDP , or Gross Domestic Product – the total value of goods and services produced in the country – contracted at an annual rate of 0.2% in Q1 2025. This figure was slightly less severe than the 0.3% decline that analysts had broadly expected, but it still represents a significant shift. Think of GDP as a report card for the US economy . A positive number means the economy is growing, while a negative number signals a slowdown or contraction. The previous quarter (Q4 2024) saw a healthy expansion of 2.4%. This sharp reversal into a GDP contraction in Q1 is therefore a notable event, suggesting the economic momentum seen late last year has faded. Here’s a quick look at the recent trend: Q4 2024 (Final Estimate): +2.4% Expansion Q1 2025 (Second Estimate): -0.2% Contraction This data point is crucial because it’s one of the primary indicators economists and policymakers use to gauge the health and direction of the economy. While this is the second of three estimates, the final number is usually close to the second, meaning this contraction is likely to stick. What Does This Economic Data Signal for the US Economy? A GDP contraction , even a modest one like 0.2%, immediately raises questions about the underlying strength of the US economy . While one quarter of negative growth doesn’t automatically mean a recession (which is typically defined by two consecutive quarters of contraction), it certainly puts recessionary fears back on the table for many analysts. What could be behind this slowdown? Several factors might contribute, including: Cooling Consumer Spending: Consumers are the engine of the US economy. If high inflation or borrowing costs are finally biting, they might be pulling back on spending. Reduced Business Investment: Uncertainty about the future economic outlook can lead companies to delay investments in new equipment, buildings, or hiring. Impact of Higher Interest Rates: The Federal Reserve’s past interest rate hikes are designed to slow the economy to combat inflation. This contraction suggests those policies are having their intended effect, perhaps more strongly now. Understanding this specific piece of economic data is key to forming a broader view of the macroeconomic landscape. Connecting the Dots: Economic Data and the Crypto Market Impact Now, let’s get to why this matters for you, the crypto enthusiast. Traditional economic data like the US GDP report can have a significant crypto market impact , albeit sometimes indirectly. Here’s how the dots connect: Investor Sentiment: A weakening US economy often leads to a shift in investor sentiment. When the economy looks shaky, investors tend to become more risk-averse. This can mean pulling money out of assets perceived as higher risk, which sometimes includes cryptocurrencies, and moving into safer havens like government bonds. Monetary Policy Expectations: A contracting economy puts pressure on the Federal Reserve. If the economy continues to slow, the Fed might feel compelled to lower interest rates sooner than previously anticipated to stimulate growth. Lower interest rates can make riskier assets, including crypto, relatively more attractive compared to low-yield traditional investments. Inflation Outlook: While the GDP report itself isn’t an inflation print, a slowing economy can potentially ease inflationary pressures as demand cools. A clearer path towards lower inflation could also influence the Fed’s actions and market sentiment, impacting crypto. Dollar Strength: Economic performance can affect the strength of the U.S. dollar. A weaker dollar can sometimes make dollar-denominated assets like Bitcoin more appealing to international investors. So, while Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks, their prices are still heavily influenced by global macroeconomic conditions and the liquidity available in the system, much of which is tied to the health of the US economy and the policies of its central bank. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Market After This US GDP Report Given this new piece of economic data , what should crypto investors consider? Stay Informed: Continue to monitor key economic data releases, not just US GDP . Inflation reports, jobs numbers, and Fed announcements are all critical pieces of the puzzle. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: A potentially slowing economy can bring increased market volatility. Ensure your portfolio allocation aligns with your comfort level for risk. Watch the Fed: Pay close attention to statements from Federal Reserve officials. Their reaction to this data will be a major factor influencing market expectations regarding future interest rates. Consider Diversification: While crypto is your focus, think about how this economic backdrop affects your overall investment strategy. This GDP contraction serves as a reminder that the crypto market doesn’t exist in a vacuum. External economic forces play a significant role in shaping its landscape. In Conclusion: A Warning Signal from the US Economy The Q1 2025 US GDP report showing a 0.2% contraction is a crucial piece of economic data that investors should not ignore. It signals potential headwinds for the US economy after a period of expansion and could influence everything from Federal Reserve policy to overall market sentiment. While the direct link isn’t always immediate, the potential crypto market impact from a slowing economy and subsequent policy responses is undeniable. Staying informed about these macroeconomic shifts is just as important as tracking on-chain metrics or project developments when navigating the dynamic world of cryptocurrency.

2025-05-29T23:30:16.000Z,"Ambitious Bitcoin Accumulation: Smarter Web Company Boosts Holdings in Bold 10-Year Plan","BitcoinWorld Ambitious Bitcoin Accumulation: Smarter Web Company Boosts Holdings in Bold 10-Year Plan In a move signaling strong conviction in the future of digital assets, UK-based web development firm The Smarter Web Company (SWC) recently announced a significant addition to its Bitcoin reserves. This purchase is not a one-off event but a deliberate step within their ambitious, decade-long strategy known as “The 10 Year Plan.” The company now proudly holds 83.24 BTC, reinforcing its position among businesses embracing Bitcoin accumulation as a core part of their financial strategy. Who is Smarter Web Company and What is Their Bold Plan? The Smarter Web Company, primarily known for its web development services, has publicly committed to a long-term Bitcoin investment strategy. Announcing their latest purchase via social media, SWC highlighted that this action is integral to their overarching digital asset roadmap. ‘The 10 Year Plan’ suggests a systematic approach to acquiring Bitcoin over an extended period, potentially employing strategies like dollar-cost averaging to mitigate volatility and build a substantial treasury position. This kind of public commitment from a company, even one outside the traditional financial sector, underscores a growing trend: businesses are increasingly looking at Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a legitimate component of their long-term financial health and strategy. SWC’s transparency about their holdings and plan is noteworthy in this evolving landscape. The Rising Trend of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings The concept of Corporate Bitcoin holdings gained significant traction following pioneering moves by companies like MicroStrategy. These early adopters paved the way, demonstrating that it’s feasible for publicly traded (and private) companies to allocate significant portions of their treasury reserves to Bitcoin. The motivations behind this trend are varied but often include: Inflation Hedge: Protecting corporate value against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Store of Value: Viewing Bitcoin as ‘digital gold,’ a scarce asset with potential for long-term appreciation. Balance Sheet Enhancement: Potential for significant returns on treasury assets that would otherwise yield minimal interest. Industry Leadership: Positioning the company at the forefront of digital asset adoption and innovation. While SWC’s holding of 83.24 BTC is modest compared to giants like MicroStrategy (which holds over 200,000 BTC), it represents a significant commitment for a company of its likely size. Every company adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet, regardless of scale, contributes to the broader narrative of institutional and corporate adoption. Decoding the Long-Term Bitcoin Plan What does a ’10 Year Plan’ for Bitcoin accumulation truly entail? Such a strategy typically implies a commitment to ride out the notorious volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Instead of trying to time the market highs and lows, a long-term approach often involves scheduled, regular purchases of Bitcoin. This Long-term Bitcoin plan can smooth out the average purchase price over time. Key aspects of a long-term accumulation plan like SWC’s might include: Defined Purchase Schedule: Buying a fixed amount of Bitcoin at regular intervals (e.g., weekly, monthly). Clear Allocation Percentage: Setting a target percentage of the company’s treasury or profits to be allocated to Bitcoin. Custody Solutions: Implementing secure methods for storing the accumulated Bitcoin (e.g., cold storage, reputable custodians). Accounting and Reporting: Establishing clear processes for accounting for Bitcoin holdings according to relevant standards. Communication: Being transparent with stakeholders (investors, employees) about the strategy and its rationale. This patient, strategic approach contrasts sharply with short-term trading and reflects a deep-seated belief in Bitcoin’s potential to increase in value significantly over the coming decade. Benefits and Challenges of Corporate Bitcoin Investment Strategy Adopting a Bitcoin investment strategy offers compelling potential benefits but also comes with notable challenges. Potential Benefits: Potential for Significant Growth: Bitcoin has historically outperformed many traditional assets over long periods. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset (at least historically) to the corporate treasury. Attracting Talent and Investors: Positioning the company as forward-thinking and innovative in the digital age. Inflation Protection: A hedge against the decreasing purchasing power of fiat currencies. Key Challenges: Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience dramatic swings, impacting the reported value of treasury holdings. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving in many jurisdictions. Security Risks: Protecting private keys from theft or loss requires robust security protocols. Accounting Complexity: Accounting for Bitcoin holdings can be complex under current rules (often treated as intangible assets subject to impairment). Public Perception: Some stakeholders may remain skeptical or critical of cryptocurrency investments. SWC’s commitment to a 10-year plan suggests they are prepared to navigate these challenges, focusing on the long-term potential rather than short-term fluctuations. Actionable Insights from SWC’s Move What can other businesses and even individual investors learn from Smarter Web Company’s decision to pursue Bitcoin accumulation over a decade? Think Long-Term: Short-term trading is risky. A long-term perspective aligns better with Bitcoin’s historical cycles and potential as a store of value. Strategy is Key: Don’t just buy Bitcoin impulsively. Develop a clear strategy (like SWC’s 10 Year Plan) outlining *why*, *how much*, and *how often* you plan to acquire. Understand the Risks: Be fully aware of the volatility, security requirements, and regulatory landscape. Start Small (if needed): You don’t need to allocate a massive amount initially. A consistent, smaller allocation over time can be effective. Secure Your Assets: Prioritize secure storage solutions from day one. SWC’s approach serves as a case study for how even non-financial companies are integrating digital assets into their core financial planning. Conclusion: A Decade of Digital Ambition The Smarter Web Company’s decision to increase its Corporate Bitcoin holdings to 83.24 BTC under the umbrella of ‘The 10 Year Plan’ is more than just a balance sheet update; it’s a statement of long-term vision. It highlights a growing confidence among diverse businesses in Bitcoin’s role as a future store of value and a hedge against economic uncertainty. While challenges exist, SWC’s commitment to a systematic, decade-long Long-term Bitcoin plan reflects a sophisticated understanding of the asset’s potential and the strategy required to harness it effectively. As more companies follow suit, the integration of digital assets into traditional finance and corporate strategy will only deepen, marking an exciting phase in the evolution of global economics.

2025-05-29T23:20:21.000Z,"Urgent: Bitcoin PoW Security Under Threat as Fees Plummet to 13-Year Low","BitcoinWorld Urgent: Bitcoin PoW Security Under Threat as Fees Plummet to 13-Year Low Hey crypto enthusiasts! Have you been keeping an eye on Bitcoin lately? While the price often grabs headlines, there’s a quiet but potentially significant development brewing beneath the surface: Bitcoin’s transaction fees have fallen to levels not seen in over a decade. This isn’t just about cheaper transactions; it’s sparking a serious debate about the long-term sustainability and security of the network’s core engine – its Proof-of-Work (PoW) model. Understanding Bitcoin PoW and Miner Revenue Before diving into the concerns, let’s quickly recap how Bitcoin PoW works. At its heart, Bitcoin relies on a decentralized network of miners who use massive amounts of computing power (hash rate) to solve complex mathematical problems. The first miner to solve the problem gets to add the next block of transactions to the blockchain and is rewarded in two ways: The Block Reward: A fixed amount of new BTC created with each block. This amount halves approximately every four years (the ‘halving’ event). Transaction Fees: Collected from users who include a small fee with their transactions to incentivize miners to prioritize and include them in blocks. This combination of block rewards and miner revenue is crucial. It pays for the electricity and hardware costs of mining, and more importantly, it incentivizes miners to secure the network by making it economically unfeasible for any single entity to gain control of the majority of the hash rate (a 51% attack). The Alarming Drop in Bitcoin Fees Recently, the contribution of Bitcoin fees to total miner revenue has plummeted. Data shows that transaction fees are now making up only about 1% of the total revenue earned by miners. To put this into perspective, this is the lowest percentage seen in 13 years, a period during which Bitcoin has undergone multiple halvings, significantly reducing the block reward. Why are fees so low right now? Several factors could be contributing: Reduced Network Congestion: Following periods of high activity (like the Ordinals craze), demand for block space has decreased. Increased Efficiency: Adoption of technologies like SegWit and batching transactions can make block space usage more efficient. Growth of Layer 2 Solutions: More transactions are potentially happening off the main chain on layers like the Lightning Network, reducing demand for base layer block space. While cheaper transactions might sound great for users, the dramatic drop in fees is raising eyebrows among researchers and experts concerned about the network’s long-term security guarantees. Is Bitcoin Security At Risk? The 51% Attack Concern This is where the core concern about Bitcoin security comes into play. The security of the PoW network is directly tied to the amount of hash rate dedicated to it. Miners provide this hash rate because they are incentivized by revenue. If the block reward continues to halve over time (eventually reaching zero) and transaction fees don’t rise significantly to compensate, the total miner revenue could become insufficient to support the massive amount of hash rate needed to make a 51% attack prohibitively expensive. An entity controlling more than 50% of the network’s total hash rate could potentially: Prevent new transactions from gaining confirmations. Reverse transactions they have sent while still retaining the funds (double-spending). Prevent other miners from finding blocks. Ethereum researcher Justin Drake recently highlighted this risk on X, estimating that a 51% attack on Bitcoin could potentially be executed with as little as $20 billion in hardware. While $20 billion is a huge sum, he contrasts this with Bitcoin’s potential future market capitalization, which some speculate could reach $200 trillion or more. In that context, a $20 billion attack cost looks like a mere fraction, raising serious questions about the proportionality of security cost to network value in the distant future. The Role of Miner Revenue Sustainability The sustainability of miner revenue is the linchpin. As the block reward diminishes with each halving, transaction fees are expected by many in the Bitcoin community to gradually become the dominant, and eventually the sole, source of miner income. The current situation, where fees are at a 13-year low despite recent halvings, challenges this long-held assumption. Some argue that the current low fee environment is temporary and that future adoption, increased usage, or new use cases (like Ordinals again) will naturally drive fees higher over time. They point to historical periods where fees spiked significantly during times of high network congestion. However, others are less optimistic, suggesting that without a structural change, the long-term decline in the block reward coupled with potentially insufficient fee growth could lead to a gradual decrease in hash rate, making the network less secure over decades. Potential Structural Reforms and Debates The discussion around low fees inevitably leads to debates about potential structural changes to Bitcoin, though these are highly controversial within the community: Increasing Fee Growth: The most organic solution, relying on increased demand for block space. Can Bitcoin’s base layer transaction volume grow enough to support security? Introducing Tail Issuance: This would mean changing Bitcoin’s hard cap of 21 million coins and introducing a small, perpetual block reward after all 21 million BTC are mined. This is seen as heresy by many Bitcoin maximalists who view the fixed supply as a core, unchangeable feature. Transitioning to Proof-of-Stake (PoS): Moving away from energy-intensive mining to a system where security relies on validators staking their coins, similar to Ethereum 2.0. This is arguably even more controversial than tail issuance, as it would fundamentally alter Bitcoin’s security model and distribution mechanism, which are considered sacrosanct by many. Currently, there is no significant movement or consensus within the core Bitcoin development community to implement radical changes like tail issuance or PoS. The prevailing belief is that the fee market will eventually mature and provide sufficient security. Broader Implications for the Crypto Ecosystem Why should the broader crypto ecosystem care about Bitcoin security ? As the largest and most established cryptocurrency, Bitcoin’s stability and security are foundational to the entire market. A successful 51% attack on Bitcoin, however unlikely it may seem today, would send shockwaves through every corner of the crypto world, severely damaging confidence and potentially leading to widespread panic and regulatory backlash. Experts warn that systemic risks to Bitcoin could have cascading effects, impacting altcoins, stablecoins, decentralized finance (DeFi), and institutional adoption. Therefore, the health and security of the Bitcoin network are of paramount importance to everyone involved in the crypto space. What Does This Mean for You? As an investor or enthusiast, understanding this debate is crucial. It highlights that even established technologies like Bitcoin face long-term challenges that require ongoing discussion and potential future solutions. While a 51% attack isn’t an imminent threat given the current hash rate and attack cost, the trend of declining fee contribution relative to the block reward is a data point worth monitoring. Keep an eye on: Transaction Fee Trends: Are fees recovering or continuing to lag? Hash Rate Levels: Is the network’s total computing power remaining high? Community Discussions: Are debates around fee mechanisms, tail issuance, or other potential changes gaining traction? Technological Developments: How are Layer 2 solutions and other scaling technologies impacting base layer fee pressure? Compelling Summary Bitcoin’s transaction fees hitting a 13-year low is more than just a statistic; it’s a signal prompting critical examination of the network’s long-term security model. While the Bitcoin PoW mechanism has proven incredibly robust, its reliance on ever-decreasing block rewards means that future security will increasingly depend on sufficient miner revenue from transaction fees. The current low fee environment, contributing just 1% to miner income, raises valid questions about whether the fee market alone can sustainably secure the network against potential 51% attack vectors in the distant future, especially as the network’s value potentially grows exponentially. While radical changes like tail issuance or PoS remain highly controversial and unlikely in the short term, the ongoing debate underscores the dynamic nature of blockchain technology and the importance of ensuring robust Bitcoin security for the health of the entire crypto ecosystem. It’s a challenge the community must continue to address as Bitcoin evolves. To learn more about the latest Bitcoin trends, explore our article on key developments shaping Bitcoin price action.

2025-05-29T23:17:15.000Z,"SEC warns cryptocurrency users not to expect bailouts from the commission","SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, fondly called crypto mom, stated that the SEC withdrawing from over-enforcement does not mean it will not move in cases of clear violations in the crypto space. Under new leadership, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has decided to drop several crypto-related lawsuits and probes. However, that doesn’t mean the agency will stop going after fraudsters, one of the agency’s top chiefs said on Thursday. The SEC plans to use its power properly this time The SEC under Gary Gensler became famous for dogging crypto with excessive regulation that stifled innovation, but things have changed. The change brought new leadership and apparently a new mandate that allowed the securities watchdog to drop several high-profile cases against firms like Coinbase, Uniswap, and OpenSea. Still, while speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Commissioner Hester Peirce told the crowd that the SEC’s new behavior does not mean people can now do whatever they want. Peirce implied that the combative side of the SEC will now be reserved for people who violate the clear existing rules. “It’s certainly not to say that there will not be enforcement. There’s a lot of bad activity, as we all know, that’s perpetrated in the name of crypto,” Peirce, who is a critic of the SEC’s previous tactic of “regulation through enforcement,” also said . In that regard, she agrees with Gensler in that crypto was “rife with fraud and manipulation.” He also said that many cryptocurrencies would be securities, but Peirce has a contrasting stance, saying that most crypto assets are probably not themselves securities on Thursday. As a result, Peirce believes trading platforms handling them shouldn’t need to register with the SEC unless they’re also touching the securities world. Commissioner Hester Peirce wants accountability from crypto users Peirce, nicknamed “crypto mom” because of her openness to the industry, also discussed investor loss and the SEC’s role on Thursday at the conference, calling for consistency, specifically among more libertarian folks in crypto. “I do think that sometimes, when something bad happens in this space, people who are remarkably free thinkers, libertarian-minded people, come in and say, ‘Where was the government? Why weren’t you protecting me? Hey, Crypto Mom, where’s my bailout?'” she mused at the conference. Peirce called for consistency. “Yes, you should have freedom to make your own choices,” she said. “And when it goes wrong, pick yourself up, dust yourself off, learn from it and do better next time. And that is the best way to move forward.” Now that the SEC is led by Trump appointees, it has been busy issuing statements and directives to carve out corners of the crypto sector from the agency’s jurisdiction, including memecoins, some crypto mining and certain stablecoins. Despite all the progress they have made, there is still much policy-making to come in the future, and lawmakers are also working on sweeping new laws that could further their agenda. The SEC has a lot of current authority to clarify the nature of crypto securities, Peirce said. But if people want a U.S. federal regulator for retail trading, they’ll need Congress to produce legislation to make that happen. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-05-29T23:15:26.000Z,"Bitcoin ETF Inflows Signal Unstoppable Investor Rotation Away From Gold","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin ETF Inflows Signal Unstoppable Investor Rotation Away From Gold Are you watching the financial markets closely? Something significant is happening, and it involves a major Investor Rotation . Recent data highlights a compelling trend: investors are increasingly shifting capital from traditional safe havens like gold into the burgeoning world of digital assets, particularly Bitcoin. This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it’s a noticeable pivot with potentially long-term implications for asset allocation strategies within the broader Crypto Market . The Great Rotation: Bitcoin ETF vs. Gold ETF Flows The most striking evidence of this shift comes from exchange-traded fund (ETF) flows. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF products have experienced an impressive surge in inflows over the past few weeks, attracting billions in fresh capital. This stands in stark contrast to the performance of Gold ETF products, which have seen significant outflows during the same period. Let’s look at the numbers reported by Bloomberg: Bitcoin ETFs: Over $9 billion in inflows in approximately five weeks. Gold ETFs: Approximately $2.8 billion in outflows during the same timeframe. This divergence in flows suggests a clear change in investor sentiment and preference. While gold has historically been the go-to asset during times of economic uncertainty, Bitcoin appears to be increasingly filling that role for a segment of the investment community. Why the Shift? Understanding the Drivers Behind Investor Rotation Several factors are contributing to this noticeable Investor Rotation . Analysts point to a mix of macroeconomic concerns and the evolving perception of Bitcoin itself. Key drivers include: Concerns over U.S. Fiscal Stability: Rising government debt and ongoing fiscal stimulus measures are prompting some investors to seek assets outside the traditional financial system. Both gold and Bitcoin are seen as potential hedges against inflation and currency devaluation, but Bitcoin’s fixed supply offers a unique appeal. Bitcoin’s Growing Role as a Hedge: While historically volatile, Bitcoin’s low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds makes it attractive as a portfolio diversifier. As confidence in traditional hedges wavers, Bitcoin’s digital scarcity and decentralized nature are gaining attention. Accessibility via ETFs: The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETF products in the U.S. has significantly lowered the barrier to entry for institutional and retail investors who were previously hesitant to hold Bitcoin directly. This ease of access is undoubtedly fueling the recent surge in inflows. Bitcoin: The Digital Store of Value? For decades, gold has reigned supreme as the ultimate Store of Value , a tangible asset believed to retain its worth over long periods, especially during economic turmoil. However, the digital age is challenging this notion, with Bitcoin emerging as a credible alternative. Here’s a quick comparison: Feature Gold Bitcoin Scarcity Finite supply, but unknown total quantity; difficult to verify Absolutely finite supply (21 million); verifiable on blockchain Portability Heavy, difficult/expensive to transport large amounts Easily transferable globally with minimal cost Divisibility Difficult to divide into small units without loss Highly divisible (down to 8 decimal places) Verifiability Requires expertise/equipment to assay purity Easily verifiable via the public ledger Storage Requires secure physical storage (vaults, safes) Stored digitally (wallets); secure with private keys While gold still holds significant appeal and a long history, Bitcoin’s digital properties make it potentially superior in terms of portability, divisibility, and verifiability in the modern era. The increasing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, partly facilitated by the success of the Bitcoin ETF , is solidifying its position as a potential digital Store of Value . What This Means for the Crypto Market The strong performance of Bitcoin ETF inflows and the corresponding outflows from Gold ETF s signal growing institutional and retail confidence in Bitcoin. This trend could have several implications for the broader Crypto Market : Increased Legitimacy: The influx of traditional investment capital through ETFs lends significant legitimacy to Bitcoin and the wider crypto space. Potential for Further Adoption: As more investors become comfortable with Bitcoin via regulated products, it could pave the way for interest in other digital assets. Market Dynamics: Large capital flows can influence market prices and volatility. Understanding these flows is crucial for anyone participating in the Crypto Market . Despite gold’s historically stronger year-to-date performance leading up to this period of rotation, the momentum behind Bitcoin, driven by its low correlation with traditional assets and its appeal amid financial system risks, is undeniable. The ease of access provided by the Bitcoin ETF has clearly played a pivotal role in accelerating this trend, allowing more investors to participate in Bitcoin’s journey to becoming a recognized Store of Value . Conclusion: A New Era for Asset Allocation? The recent surge in Bitcoin ETF inflows coinciding with outflows from Gold ETF s marks a potentially significant moment in the evolution of investment strategies. While gold retains its historical importance, Bitcoin is rapidly gaining traction as a digital alternative, driven by macroeconomic factors and its unique properties as a potential Store of Value . This Investor Rotation highlights the increasing acceptance of Bitcoin within traditional finance and signals a potential shift in how investors think about hedging risk and preserving wealth in the 21st century Crypto Market .

2025-05-29T23:02:00.000Z,"Crypto price forecasts: ICP, Bitcoin, Ethereum","Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other altcoins were largely muted on Thursday as the market reflected on the recent Federal Reserve minutes and the court’s decision to end Donald Trump’s tariffs against other countries. This article provides a forecast for top cryptocurrencies like Internet Computer (ICP), Bitcoin (BTC), and Ethereum (ETH). Internet Computer (ICP) price is showing bottoming signs ICP price chart Internet Computer’s ICP token peaked at $15.5 in November last year as most cryptocurrencies rallied. It then plunged sharply and found a bottom at $4.20 in April when Trump unveiled his tariffs against other countries. The coin has now stabilized at the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). It has also moved above the upper side of the descending channel shown in black. This channel has a close resemblance to the a falling wedge, one of the most popular bullish reversal patterns in technical analysis. The coin has formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern, another bullish reversal sign. It also formed a double-bottom pattern at $4.475. Therefore, there are signs that the coin is bottoming, which will lead to more gains in the coming weeks. More gains will be confirmed if the coin rises above the key resistance level at $6.133, the highest point on May 12.

The crypto major’s trading volume and ETF inflows point to heightened investor interest. According to data from SoSoValue, ETH spot ETFs recorded 8 consecutive sessions as of 28th May. On Wednesday, 4 out of the top 9 ETFs recorded a total of $84.89 million in daily net inflows while the rest had zero flows. At the same time, the altcoin’s trading volume is up by 21.38% over the past 24 hours. In the short term, I expect Ethereum price to hold steady above the 20-day EMA at around $2,500. On the upside, the entry of more buyers may help break the resistance at the three-month high hit earlier on Thursday. If successful, the next hurdle will likely be at $2,956 as the bulls eye the psychologically crucial zone of $3,000. Bitcoin price in consolidation mode as profit-taking continues BTC price chart | Source: TradingView Bitcoin price has been in consolidation mode for a week now after topping the all-time high hit earlier in the year to reach a fresh high at $112,051. Even with the profit-raking, the bulls remain in control with data from SoSoValue indicating ten consecutive sessions of daily net inflows for US Bitcoin sport ETFs. Even with the pullback, Bitcoin price is set to remain above the crucial zone of $100,000, which is along the medium-term 50-day EMA. In the near term, the all-time high of $112,051 is a resistance level worth watching. On the lower side, Bitcoin price will likely find support at $106,284, below which the crypto major may drop to $104,583.

2025-05-29T22:20:46.000Z,"Ethereum researcher raise concerns about Bitcoin potential security problem due to its low fees","Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake has warned about the security of the Bitcoin Network. Drake shared his view on X, noting that the Bitcoin Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism is a ticking time bomb. The blockchain security expert, one of the masterminds behind the Merge, i.e., Ethereum transition from PoW to Proof of Stake (PoS), identified Bitcoin’s low fees as the major risk to its security. According to Drake , Bitcoin fees have fallen for 13 years, with miners generating less than 10 BTC in daily fees. He believes that this low fee represents a disincentive for most miners who are the ones securing the network and could eventually affect the network, a contagion risk for the whole crypto industry. He said: “Bitcoin’s security model is broken. If Bitcoin gets taken over, the fallout could take the entire crypto ecosystem. The systemic risks can’t be ignored.” The researcher noted that Bitcoin fees have constantly declined for over a decade despite halving and reducing the issuance rate. In fact, the fees are falling faster than the issuance rate on the network, with a 30-day moving average (MA) of Bitcoin transaction fees currently at 6.5 BTC per day. Bitcoin Transaction Fees.(Source: X/Drake) This meant that fees only account for around 1% of miners’ revenue over the years, and Bitcoin miners could see a 100% decline in their revenue once the complete 21 million BTC have been mined. However, Category Labs researcher Kushal Babel disagreed with the argument, noting that denominating fees in BTC to say it is at an all-time low is wrong. According to him, the whole argument might change if BTC fees are denominated in US Dollars. Babel argued that Drake’s opinion that the ratio of BTC market cap to the amount securing it makes the network vulnerable to a 51% attack is a weak argument at best, and the focus should be on the cost of an attack in dollars. Higher prices may not save the Bitcoin network from attack Meanwhile, Drake added that a rise in Bitcoin prices could be inimical to network security because it would make it harder to sustain the BTC-denominated fees. In order to explain this, he described a scenario where Bitcoin price increases but fees stay unchanged, noting that fees at the time will only cover around 10% of the security cost for the network. He said: “Let’s be optimistic and say BTC rises to $1M, and today’s 6.5 BTC/day in fees is maintained: $6.5M/day in fees, 10% of today’s security budget. Bitcoin would be a $20T asset secured by 1/10th of today’s hashing infrastructure.” Thus, he believes that the cost of attacking the Bitcoin network will not increase even as the price of BTC increases. This could make it possible for a 51% attack on the Bitcoin network to cost as little as $20 billion, even if the network has a market cap of $200 trillion tokens. Drake further debunked the presumption that Bitcoin fees will increase, noting that this has not happened in the last 13 years. He added that all previous attempts to boost Bitcoin fees by increasing its utility as a transaction layer have failed to achieve sustainable long-term gains, with projects such as Ordinals, Liquid, Omni, Babylon, and others only creating short-term spikes. Potential solutions to Bitcoin’s fragile security With Drake highlighting Bitcoin’s risks, he proposed two solutions that could work for the network if fees do not increase. According to him, the solution is for Bitcoin to expand the total supply beyond the 21 million cap or for the network to switch to Proof of Stake. Unsurprisingly, he acknowledged that these two proposed solutions are unlikely to be implemented, given that they are completely against the conventional ethos of the Bitcoin community. However, he insisted that creating a Bitcoin Virtual Machine or Proof of Authority, where the major mining pools will secure the network, is unlikely to work. Still, he called on anyone who could explain how the PoA will function to do so. Interestingly, other users have proposed more potential solutions. Ethereum Foundation researcher Ansgar Dieetrichs recommended that Bitcoin developers end congestion pricing and increase the fee floor with the hope that the revenue is enough. He noted that this is likely the best solution for the network, but added other options, such as Bitcoin becoming a Layer-2 on a secure PoS chain or becoming an ERC-20 token. Other solutions include mining at a loss or allowing centralized custodians and large BTC holders to donate to on-chain security. Unsurprisingly, not everyone welcomed the opinion, especially among Bitcoin supporters. Bitcoin maxi Udi Wizardheimer criticized the opinion, noting that Drake is concerned about a security problem that Ethereum might have in 100 years, when Ethereum is struggling presently.

2025-05-29T22:18:41.000Z,"Suspects in Manhattan Crypto Kidnapping, Torture Case Plead Not Guilty as Investigation Widens","Two men suspected in the kidnapping and torture of a 28-year-old Italian cryptocurrency investor have pleaded not guilty, while the investigation into their case appears to have expanded to the New York Police Department itself. New York police had previously arrested William Duplessie , 33, and John Woeltz , 37, on the charges, as well as a third individual, Beatrice Folchi, 24, though her prosecution is being deferred. The victim has not been publicly named. The men are accused of kidnapping the victim and holding him hostage in a luxury townhouse in Manhattan’s ritzy SoHo neighborhood for more than two weeks. During that time, New York City police say the trio tortured the man, forcing him to take drugs, dangling him from a ledge, urinating on him and electrocuting him in an effort to force him to hand over the private keys to his bitcoin. The alleged perpetrators are accused of making t-shirts of the victim with a crack pipe in his mouth and taking Polaroids of the victim with a gun to his head. The victim escaped last Friday, grabbing his laptop and getting out of the townhouse and then seeking help from a traffic officer. Duplessie entered a not-guilty plea to five different charges, including kidnapping with an intent to collect a ransom, kidnapping and causing a physical injury, criminal possession of a loaded firearm, assault with an intent to cause a physical injury with a weapon and unlawful imprisonment, according to the court docket. Woeltz was charged with kidnapping, assault, unlawful imprisonment and criminal possession of a firearm, and he also pleaded not guilty, according to his court docket. Two NYPD officers, including a detective assigned to Mayor Eric Adams' protection detail, worked for both Duplessie and Woeltz in their off-duty hours and have now been placed on modified duty, Bloomberg reported Thursday. A source familiar told CoinDesk that the two officers are not believed to be part of the kidnapping, but rather did security work for the defendants. They may have driven the victim from an airport to the townhouse, but have not been tied to his torture, the source said. A spokesperson for the NYPD said the matter was \""under internal review.\"" A spokesperson for the mayor's office said in a statement that, \""Every city employee is expected to follow the law, including our officers, both on and off duty. We are disturbed by these allegations, and as soon as it came to our attention, the officers were placed on modified duty.

2025-05-29T22:01:42.000Z,"Iranian International Behind Robbinhood Ransomware Scheme Pleads Guilty – U.S. Department of Justice","An Iranian man is pleading guilty to being the mastermind behind the Robbinhood ransomware scam. According to a recent press release by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), 37-year-old Sina Gholinejad of Iran has pleaded guilty to participating in a hack of multiple cities across the US, causing widespread disruption and tens of millions of dollars in losses. Authorities say that in January 2019, Gholinejad and his co-conspirators gained and maintained illegal access to the victims’ computers, stealing sensitive data and uploading the Robbinhood malware, which in turn would take over a victim’s PC, encrypt its files, and attempt to extort crypto assets out of them in exchange for the release of the data. Gholinejad and his team would then attempt to launder the stolen funds through crypto mixing services and chain-hopping and hide their identities using advanced methods. As stated by Matthew R. Galeotti, Head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, in the press release, “The ransomware attack against the City of Baltimore forced the city to take hundreds of computers offline and prevented the city from performing basic functions for months. Gholinejad’s conviction reflects the Criminal Division’s commitment to bringing cybercriminals who target our cities, healthcare system, and businesses to justice no matter where they are located. There will be no impunity for these destructive attacks.” Other cities affected included Greenville, North Carolina, as well as Yonkers, New York, and Gresham, Oregon. Gholinejad is scheduled to be sentenced in August and could face a maximum penalty of up to 30 years behind bars.

2025-05-29T22:01:27.000Z,"Victory For Binance: US SEC Decides To Dismiss Lawsuit","The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has voluntarily dismissed its lawsuit against Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange on Thursday, May 29. This decision was revealed through a court filing in Washington, D.C., and marks a significant moment in terms of regulation for both the exchange and the broader cryptocurrency industry in the US. SEC Ends Legal Battle With Binance The dismissal follows a joint stipulation signed by legal representatives for the SEC, Binance, and the exchange’s founder, Changpeng Zhao (CZ) Originally, the SEC had accused Binance of various violations, including artificially inflating trading volumes and diverting customer funds. Additionally, the regulatory body claimed that Binance failed to restrict US customers from accessing its platform and misled investors regarding its market surveillance capabilities. The SEC’s lawsuit also alleged that the exchange “unlawfully” facilitated the trading of several tokens that previous leadership at the agency had classified as unregistered securities. New Administration’s Influence These accusations contributed to heightened scrutiny of Binance during the agency and the White House’s previous administration under Gary Gensler and former President Joe Biden respectively, and raised concerns about regulatory compliance within the cryptocurrency sector. The decision to dismiss the lawsuit comes amid ongoing discussions about the regulatory landscape for digital assets in the United States with President Trump contributing to notable changes in both legislation and key positions in the regulatory agencies. This development has been met with notable optimism, as it signals a significant shift in the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s approach to regulating cryptocurrency exchanges in the country under its new chair Paul Atkins. Despite the news, Binance Coin (BNB), the exchange’s native token, still records losses of 1.4% in the 24-hour time frame, trading at $675 per token.

2025-05-29T22:00:54.000Z,"SEC Files to Dismiss Long-Running Lawsuit Against Binance","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission moved to drop its long-running lawsuit against crypto exchange Binance on Thursday, without providing an explanation in a court filing. The SEC and Binance filed a joint motion, noting that the case had already been paused while the SEC's new crypto task force worked to \""develop a regulatory framework for crypto assets.\"" \""In the exercise of its discretion and as a policy matter, the Commission believes the dismissal of this Litigation is appropriate,\"" the joint filing said . \""... the Commission's decision to seek dismissal of this Litigation does not necessarily reflect the Commission's position in any other litigation or proceeding.\"" The SEC has not published a framework yet, though lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives introduced their formal bill to define how the SEC and its sister agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, would each oversee digital assets earlier on Thursday. The parties want the case dismissed with prejudice, meaning the SEC would not be able to bring this lawsuit against Binance again in the future. The filing also includes provisions to block Binance or its affiliated entities and executives from filing a suit or complaint against the SEC tied to the lawsuit, which was brought in June 2023 against Binance, Binance.US and Binance founder Changpeng CZ Zhao. Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who's overseeing the case, previously ruled that the SEC had brought plausible charges against the exchange and allowed most the lawsuit to proceed last year. In a statement, an external spokesperson for Binance.US said they were \""pleased that the SEC fully dismissed its charges against Binance.US, confirming what we have always known — that the company did not violate U.S. securities laws.\"" \""Today’s news is a major milestone for our company, as putting this matter to rest allows us to focus entirely on growing our business and work on restoring our relationships that were impacted by the SEC,\"" the statement said. \""We are excited about the future of Binance.US and crypto in the U.S. and look forward to continuing to offer access to crypto in the U.S., while maintaining our commitment to compliance and our customers.\"" Thursday's filing just marks the latest withdrawal for the SEC, which already moved to drop over a dozen other investigations and lawsuits . Prior to 2025, the SEC was investigating non-fungible token marketplaces and suing crypto exchanges. Binance was just one exchange the SEC alleged was illegally operating as an unregistered broker, clearinghouse and exchange. Others included Coinbase and Kraken. The SEC's about-turn came after Donald Trump retook office as the U.S. President, appointing Commissioner Mark Uyeda as acting chair and nominating Paul Atkins to be the agency's full chair. Atkins was confirmed and sworn into office last month. Last week, Binance announced it would list USD1, a stablecoin issued by World Liberty Financial, a crypto company tied to Trump, some of Trump's children and some of his affiliates. Earlier Thursday, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce said during an appearance at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas that some crypto investors should not expect a bailout or government protection if they invest in speculative digital assets.

2025-05-29T22:00:37.000Z,"Bitcoin Primed To Implode To $200,000 In 2025 As ‘Obvious’ Bullish Breakout Indicator Emerges, Pundit Predicts","Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies posted significant losses on May 29 as markets continued to price out interest rate cuts — a key tailwind for crypto. Data from CoinGecko shows BTC dipping below $106,000 to challenge multiday lows. Still, one pundit remains confident that the benchmark crypto is prepping for its next major leg up as a highly reliable signal materializes for the first time since mid-2024. Bitcoin To $200,000 In 2025 Popular crypto analyst Stockmoney Lizards took to X to tell his 158,700 followers that Bitcoin is primed to repeat its bull run to a cycle top like in 2016 and 2020. The monthly Optimized Trend Tracker (OTT) tool, which provides price trend insights by leveraging averages and average true range data, is set for Bitcoin’s next parabolic rally to fresh all-time high. “The pattern is so obvious it hurts,” the X post claimed, calling OTT the “cleanest trend indicator you can use for macro moves.” In 2014-2016, the Bitcoin price retested the cluster of OTT trend lines, then rocketed to $20K historic highs after solidifying them as support. The same pattern was witnessed in 2018-2020. And now, two retests have already transpired, suggesting a major upside move is imminent for Bitcoin. “We just broke out of the monthly OTT bands. Again,” the analyst observed. According to Stockmoney Lizards, OTT bands show you when assets are ready for their next major rally, noting that “we’re there.” As for the price target, the analyst envisions Bitcoin hitting $200,000 by the end of 2025, with a potential “extension” to $250,000 next year. Smart Money Agrees On Bitcoin’s Year-End Target Several analysts have set $200,000 as their target for the world’s largest digital asset this year. Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets at British multinational bank Standard Chartered, has been one of the leading voices. As ZyCrypto reported previously, Kendrick predicted that Bitcoin will reach $120,000 in the second quarter of 2025 en route to $200,000 by year-end , fueled by strategic asset reallocation away from US assets, regulatory headwinds, and aggressive accumulation by whales. Even Ripple boss Bradley Garlinghouse believes that Bitcoin shattering the $200K milestone “is not unreasonable” amid shifting regulatory winds in the United States. Meanwhile, BitMEX co-founder and former CEO, Arthur Hayes, said Bitcoin could soar to $250,000 in 2025 if the United States Federal Reserve resumes quantitative easing (QE).",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-primed-to-implode-to-200000-in-2025-as-obvious-bullish-breakout-indicator-emerges-pundit-predicts/,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare
2025-05-29T22:00:21.000Z,"Banco Santander To Stablecoin and Retail Crypto Services","Banco Santander SA is looking to expand into digital assets. According to a Bloomberg report citing sources familiar with the matter, the bank plans to introduce a stablecoin and provide cryptocurrency services to retail clients through its digital banking platform. The report reveals that these plans are still in the early stages. Banco Santander Leaps Into Stable Token Issuance Undoubtedly, this move is part of Santander’s larger goal to include digital assets in its services. This move also comes with the growing stablecoin market, and altcoins are seeing widespread adoption from key industry players. Recall that in November 2023, Santander Private Banking International started allowing clients with Swiss accounts to trade Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). The bank uses a regulated custody model to ensure the security of these assets. As reported by TheCoinRise, this specialized trading option is subject to predefined criteria, providing a strategic and discerning approach to cryptocurrency involvement. The bank could become an important player in the evolving digital finance ecosystem by developing a stablecoin and expanding its retail crypto offerings. BBVA Set to Launch Stablecoin on Ethereum Blockchain In 2024, BBVA, a Spanish multinational banking giant and Santander’s rival, said it plans to launch its stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain . Notably, this project is powered by Visa’s new tokenization platform, VTAP. This move could also make BBVA the first global bank to issue a stablecoin on the network. Meanwhile, BBVA’s stablecoin initiative on the Ethereum blockchain is not just a technical experiment. It is a bold testament to the future of banking. The pilot, expected to go live in 2025, will begin with a selected group of customers. The project aims for BBVA to mint, transfer, and redeem stablecoins while leveraging Visa’s VTAP. Above all, it is geared towards offering a seamless experience for its customers. Currently, BBVA is testing its stablecoin core functionalities within the VTAP sandbox. These tests involve issuing, transferring, and redeeming stablecoins on a testnet of the Ethereum blockchain. Stablecoin Demand Still Booming Major financial institutions’ drive to explore a stablecoin project reflects rising interest in the sector . According to recent market data, the total stablecoin market capitalization surged over 30% in 2025 alone, from $205 billion to $251 billion. Austin Campbell, a professor at NYU and founder of Zero Knowledge Consulting, remarked that traditional banks may be “panicking” as stablecoins begin to challenge core banking models. Big Tech is also getting involved. Meta has reportedly begun exploring how to integrate stablecoin payments across its platforms. Intriguingly, this underlines the growing relevance of blockchain-based assets in everyday financial infrastructure.

We will campaign for this, and we will put it in place when we win in the general election,” Farage said on stage at the Bitcoin conference in Las Vegas. “We are going to launch, in Britain, a crypto revolution. We’re going to make London one of the major trading centers of the world. We’re deadly serious,” Farage added. The legislation will prohibit banks from debanking customers for interacting with crypto, Farage stated. He also talked about implementing a capital gains tax of 10% of crypto assets, arguing that “If taxes are reasonable, people will pay them.” He argued against the implementation of a British central bank digital currency (CBDC) as well.

2025-05-29T21:35:59.000Z,"Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino comfirms the company holds over 100,000 BTC and 50+ tons of gold","Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, told a packed audience at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas Thursday that the company now holds more than 100,000 BTC and over 50 tons of gold, confirming its spot as one of the largest holders of both assets in the crypto industry. Per Cryptopolitan’s calculations, the bitcoin stash is worth over $10 billion at current prices, and the gold bars make up another huge slice of reserves. On the same presentation slide, Paolo showed that Tether earned a $13 billion profit in 2024, making it the most profitable name in crypto by a long shot. Paolo explains Tether’s gold decision at the Bitcoin event The crowd at Bitcoin 2025 wasn’t full of gold lovers, but Paolo didn’t dodge that. He responded directly to the tension. “Many bitcoiners don’t like talking about gold as if gold would take away something from Bitcoin. There is no way. Bitcoin is perfect. Gold is imperfect,” Paolo said . He added, “Gold is not competing with bitcoin; gold is competing with fiat and that’s why we like a little bit of gold.” “We invested 2 billion in energy production and bitcoin mining actually is a bit more than that. Something that we have been very shy to say, but I think that it’s very realistic that by the end of the year, Tether will be the biggest Bitcoin miner in the world, even including all the public companies.” Tether’s most recent financial disclosure for Q1 2025 laid out its current reserves. The report confirmed that Tether is holding over $7 billion in bitcoin and more than $6 billion in standard physical gold bars. That bitcoin valuation was based on a BTC price of around $83,000 at the time of the report. And that’s not the only tie-in. Earlier Thursday, Tether backer Cantor Fitzgerald Asset Management announced a new product: a fund that will offer direct exposure to bitcoin with “1-to-1 downside protection based on the price of gold.” While all that was happening, Tether-backed company Twenty One Capital was updating its financial filing. The company raised another $100 million by selling convertible notes, bringing its total raise to $685 million. Twenty One is led by Jack Mallers, founder of Strike, and is forming through a SPAC merger with Cantor Equity Partners, which is already listed on Nasdaq. Before this new round, Twenty One had already locked down $585 million, with $385 million from earlier convertible notes and $200 million through a PIPE deal. This latest funding will go straight into buying more bitcoin. The company already spent $458 million on BTC earlier this month, and another $3.6 billion came in as part of the merger.

2025-05-29T21:10:36.000Z,"U.S. House Republicans Officially Introduce Crypto Market Structure Bill","Leading Republicans in the House of Representatives have formally introduced their latest version of the bill to establish a regulatory structure for digital assets markets, something the industry has clamored for for years. The successor to the previous session's Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), the new bill called the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act is being pushed by top Republicans in the House Financial Services and the House Agriculture committees. Stablecoin legislation is still the frontrunner to be the first major piece of U.S. crypto law, but Thursday's introduction pushes the ball forward on the more important and complex of the two companion efforts. \""America should be the global leader in the digital assets marketplace, but we can’t do that without establishing a clear regulatory framework,\"" said Representative Dusty Johnson, the South Dakota Republican who leads the agriculture subcommittee focused on digital assets, in a statement on the bill's introduction. The hefty 236-page Clarity Act — likely a starting point for lengthy negotiations between the parties in the House and eventually their Senate counterparts — gives the Commodity Futures Trading Commission \""exclusive regulatory jurisdiction over digital commodity cash or spot markets that occur on or with new CFTC registered entities,\"" which represents the bulk of crypto activity according to the current thinking of U.S. regulators. The legislation would set up a regime in which crypto platforms would have options for registration with the CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission, depending on whether they're trading in digital assets commodities such as bitcoin BTC, securities or both. Those seeking registration with the CFTC as a digital commodity exchange, broker or dealer could get provisional registrations while the agency is working on rules. The bill also requires crypto platforms to be regulated as financial firms under the Bank Secrecy Act; exempts certain decentralized finance (DeFi) operations and wallet providers from SEC oversight; bans future efforts of regulators to force custody firms to hold their customers' assets on their own balance sheets as the SEC staff sought to do under a now-scrapped accounting stance; and puts some transactional authorities over payment stablecoins — which are clearly stated to not be securities — in the hands of whichever regulator already oversees the firm involved in the activity. The Clarity Act additionally delved into so-called \""qualified digital asset custodians\"" — previously a controversial point when the SEC sought to allow only a narrow array of regulated custodians to handle the assets of investment advisers' clients. The new bill sets the standard for such a custodian as one under \""adequate supervision and appropriate regulation by certain federal, state, or foreign authorities\"" — a bar the CFTC will be called to define. DeFi is kicked down the road, with the bill demanding the SEC, CFTC and Treasury Department study that arena of digital assets and come back with a report in a year on how to proceed. The Government Accountability Office would also be asked to write a report on DeFi and on non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The involved regulators would have a year to put the Clarity Act's market structure rules into effect if the law were enacted. That's a tight timeframe for complex financial regulation, which can often take more than a year — or even several years — for the agency staffs to write rules and seek public input. Despite similar timelines in the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, for instance, there are still a few provisions that haven't yet been completed. The Senate will return to a floor debate next week on its stablecoin bill, which has already cleared several procedural hurdles with bipartisan support, despite loud Democratic misgivings about President Donald Trump's personal business connections to the crypto sector his government is seeking to regulate. But it's unclear whether that legislation will mesh with whatever version of stablecoin oversight the House eventually votes on, leaving uncertainty about exactly how crypto legislation will proceed in this session. Some discussion remains about whether the stablecoin and market structure bills should be combined as a single crypto push in Congress. Trump has called for both to land on his desk by the August congressional break, though many crypto insiders in Washington see that as a highly ambitious goal. The relevant House committees are set to hold digital assets hearings next week that will give members a chance to publicly discuss the details of the legislation.

2025-05-29T21:01:32.000Z,"Bitcoin Powers to $112K, But On-Chain Metrics Warn of Potential Pause: CryptoQuant","Bitcoin continues to dominate headlines after smashing through a new all-time high of $112,000 last week, reinforcing bullish sentiment across the crypto markets . Yet, despite the hype, on-chain data from CryptoQuant suggests traders should tread with caution—a cooling period may be on the horizon. Bull Score Index Points to Bull Market Continuation According to CryptoQuant , Bitcoin remains solidly in bull market territory. The Bull Score Index—a key measure of on-chain activity—currently stands at 80. Historically, this index has reliably indicated that Bitcoin continues to trend upwards as long as it remains above 50. This strong score reflects robust participation from retail and institutional investors, further fueled by macro tailwinds and increasing global adoption. The market’s optimism is backed by substantial demand: in the past 30 days alone, Bitcoin demand grew by an estimated 229,000 BTC. While this is still under the 279,000 BTC peak seen in December 2024, it’s getting close—a potential indicator that the current buying frenzy might be losing steam. Whale Accumulation Slows, Demand Nears Historical Top Though investor enthusiasm is still evident, there are early signs that the rally could be approaching a plateau. Whale-held Bitcoin balances have climbed 2.8% in the last month—a pace that has historically preceded a slowdown in large-scale accumulation. With buying activity nearing levels associated with local tops, Bitcoin may enter a period of consolidation. CryptoQuant’s data implies that while the bull market isn’t over, the current growth rate may not be sustainable without a short-term correction or pause. Traders’ Profit Margins Hint at Imminent Resistance Another key metric to watch is the Trader’s Unrealized Profit Margin, which rose to 32% last week. When this figure nears 40%, or drops below its 30-day moving average—currently at 19%—price momentum often weakens. If Bitcoin does maintain its upward trajectory, $120K could act as the next major resistance. This level coincides with the upper band of the On-chain Traders’ Realized Price—a historical ceiling during past bull runs. In short, while the broader outlook remains bullish, CryptoQuant’s indicators suggest caution. As Bitcoin scales new heights, savvy investors should watch the metrics closely—the next few weeks could determine whether this rally continues or cools off.

2025-05-29T21:00:50.000Z,"Ethereum Spot Premium Signals Strength – $2,800 Resistance In Focus","Ethereum is showing signs of renewed strength as it continues to trade above the $2,700 level, reaching as high as $2,790 in recent hours. The price action has energized the market, with many analysts now calling for a major breakout that could not only lift ETH further but also trigger the long-awaited altseason. Related Reading: Altseason Loading? Analyst Explains How FTX $5B Distribution May Trigger The Next Bull Leg While Bitcoin has led the rally for most of the year, Ethereum appears to be catching up. According to top analyst Daan, the ETH spot premium remains firm, signaling sustained demand even in the absence of ETF-level inflows. “It doesn’t have as many ETF inflows as BTC does,” Daan noted. This relative strength, combined with growing optimism around altcoins, is fueling speculation that Ethereum could soon test—and possibly break—critical resistance levels. With sentiment turning bullish across the market and ETH gaining momentum, all eyes are now on whether it can push past key resistance and lead the charge into a broader altcoin breakout. The coming days could prove pivotal as Ethereum sets the tone for the next phase of crypto market expansion. Ethereum Tests Critical Resistance As It Faces A Pivotal Moment Ethereum is now confronting what many analysts consider the most important resistance level of the current cycle. The zone between $2,700 and $2,800 has become the battleground for ETH’s next major move. A successful breakout could trigger a run toward all-time highs, while rejection may lead to a healthy—but deeper—retracement. Global macro conditions are adding weight to this moment. Rising U.S. Treasury yields and persistent inflation continue to rattle traditional markets, increasing systemic stress. Yet, in this uncertain environment, Ethereum and Bitcoin have shown resilience, suggesting that investors are increasingly viewing them as alternatives or hedges against traditional financial risks. Daan shared insights reinforcing this bullish outlook. According to his analysis, the ETH spot premium remains firm despite lacking the ETF-driven inflows seen with Bitcoin. ETH doesn’t require as much inflow relative to its market cap to sustain bullish momentum. However, the $2,800 level remains a significant barrier. It represents a key inflection point for Ethereum’s price action and overall market sentiment. The coming days are crucial, as Ethereum’s ability to either break above or get rejected at this resistance could shape the altcoin market’s direction for the rest of the quarter. Related Reading: Dogecoin Flashes Buy Signal – Key Indicator Hints At Rebound ETH Price Analysis: Testing Key Liquidity Levels Ethereum is currently trading at $2,731 on the 4-hour chart, showing strong bullish momentum as it tests the key $2,800 resistance level. After weeks of consolidation between $2,500 and $2,700, ETH has broken out with conviction, riding higher moving averages and increased volume. The 34 EMA at $2,622 and the 50 SMA at $2,598 continue to act as dynamic support, confirming the strength of the uptrend. This breakout attempt follows a long period of compression, where ETH built a base of higher lows. Price has now surged to challenge a major resistance zone that has historically capped upward momentum. If bulls manage to flip this level into support, it could open the door to a sharp move toward $3,000 and higher. Related Reading: Solana Funding Rates Turn Negative – Early Sign Of Selling Pressure? Volume has picked up on the most recent push, a positive sign that buyers are stepping in with more confidence.

The Canadian company announced on Thursday that it acquired an additional 26,478 SOL coins for $4.7 million at an average price of about $177. According to the announcement, SOL Strategies sold its remaining 3.21 Bitcoin at an average price of about $103,251, thus earning a total of $331k.

Rising Demand for Solana by Institutional Investors As a top-tier U.S. made crypto project, Solana network has significantly benefited from the rising demand from institutional investors. In addition to SOL Strategies, the Solana network has received significant boost from other publicly traded companies led by Janover Inc. (NASDAQ: JNVR), which purchased 80,567 Solana coins valued at $10.5 million last month. As of this writing, Janover held about 163,651 SOL coins, worth about $27 million.

2025-05-29T20:58:07.000Z,"Former PayPal CEO Makes Exciting Predictions About Bitcoin","Former PayPal President and Lightspark CEO David Marcus made striking statements about the future of Bitcoin and the latest developments in the sector in the Squawk Box program he attended on CNBC. Speaking after the Bitcoin 2025 Conference, Marcus argued that digital assets have now become an important part of the mainstream financial system. One of Marcus’ most striking statements was, “Many major US banks are about to join the Bitcoin network.” Marcus, who stated that institutions such as NewBank, one of the leading digital banks in Latin America, and Revolut, based in Europe, have already integrated into the Bitcoin network with the Lightspark infrastructure, announced that major US-based banks will soon take similar steps. “We are currently active in 70 countries and users can convert any currency to another in real time 24 hours a day, seven days a week,” he said. Related News: Critical Ethereum Report from JPMorgan: Can ETH Recover? According to Marcus, Bitcoin is making the “digital gold” vision that has been talked about for years a reality. “This is no longer just an idea; it is happening, and people really care about Bitcoin,” he said. Marcus, who predicted that developments such as GameStop’s inclusion of Bitcoin on its balance sheet would become widespread in the corporate world, said, “After companies such as MicroStrategy, which first adopted this strategy, dozens of new companies are now moving forward on this path.” Marcus said that this diversity enables Bitcoin to be adopted more at the institutional level and creates a structure that distributes risk. On the program, Marcus was also asked about President Donald Trump and his family’s interest in cryptocurrencies. “The president’s family can buy stocks, hold bonds, why can’t they hold crypto assets?” Marcus asked, and he stated that regulations in this area should be made within the framework of ethical principles. “Digital assets are now a mainstream investment class and more people, even politicians’ families, are starting to acquire these assets,” he said. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-29T20:49:45.000Z,"Pakistan to Establish Bitcoin Reserve Amid IMF Scrutiny","Pakistan has recently announced plans to create a national Bitcoin reserve. According to the post on X , this move has attracted much attention in the global financial and crypto sectors. There is no doubt that the country wants to lead in adopting digital assets, even though it may face challenges with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Pakistan Government Has Lots of Plans for its Bitcoin Reserve The Pakistani government affirmed that it will create a national Bitcoin wallet to store its reserves safely. Officials emphasized that these holdings are for long-term investment and will not be sold. As such, Pakistan is allocating 2,000 megawatts of electricity to support Bitcoin mining and to create AI-powered data centers. This move shows the government’s commitment to using advanced technology to enhance national development. Ultimately, the goal is to make Pakistan a regional digital finance and innovation center. Meanwhile, this move has raised eyebrows considering the IMF’s stance on Bitcoin reserves. The IMF has warned countries like El Salvador about buying Bitcoin due to financial stability worries, regulatory issues, and monetary policy risks. Although the IMF has not responded formally to Pakistan’s announcement, its previous objections could affect the next program review. Pakistan Eyes Leading Role in Digital Finance Pakistan’s recent efforts to formalize its crypto sector align with its strong global performance. The country ranked ninth in Chainalysis’ 2024 Global Crypto Adoption Index, driven primarily by high retail participation. According to Statista, the number of crypto users in Pakistan will surpass 27 million by 2025. These statistics highlight the sector’s rapid growth in a population of 247 million. With infrastructure, incentives, and regulation all moving into place, Pakistan appears poised to become a major digital asset and AI hub. IMF Redefines Bitcoin Recall that the IMF has significantly changed how digital assets like BTC are classified in global financial systems. The financial organization released a new edition of its Balance of Payments Manual (BPM7) to introduce detailed classifications for Bitcoin, stablecoins, and other digital assets. Notably, this move impacts how nations record crypto transactions and how these assets are taxed and regulated. The new manual categorizes Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies as non-produced non-financial assets. This means they are considered capital assets, like land, art, or intellectual property, rather than traditional money or financial investments. The IMF explained that Bitcoin’s role as a medium of exchange without liabilities sets it apart from government-backed money.

2025-05-29T20:36:09.000Z,"Bitcoin Slides Below $106K; Analyst Sees Ether Breakout Looming","Bitcoin BTC quietly slid to its weakest price in nine days on Thursday afternoon as crypto markets cooled off after a multi-week rally from the April lows. The top cryptocurrency hit a session low of $105,750 before rebounding to just above $106,000. It was down 1.5% in the last 24 hours, but still only 5% away from record high levels. The CoinDesk 20 — an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization except for exchange coins, memecoins and stablecoins — has slumped 0.9% in the last 24 hours, with solana SOL and avalanche AVAX underperforming BTC with losses of 1.8% and 2%, respectively. Meanwhile, Ethereum's ether ETH and XRP XRP defied the downtrend with 1%-2% gains. Crypto stocks have had a relatively muted session. Coinbase (COIN) is down 2.7% but Strategy (MSTR) has risen 0.8%. Bitcoin mining firms Bitfarms (BITF), Bit Digital (BTBT), CleanSpark (CLSK) and Greenidge Generation Holding (GREE) booked roughly 4% losses. A check on traditional markets showed U.S. equities giving back most of the gains on yesterday's court ruling that blocked the Trump administration's global tariffs. However, a U.S. appeals court today reinstated the tariffs while the government appealed the earlier ruling, perhaps adding to investor uncertainty. LMAX Group market strategist Joel Kruger expects a volatile ride with tariffs again back in focus with the ongoing appeal and the self-imposed July 9 deadline for trade deals approaching, but still sees further upside for digital assets. “Bitcoin remains robust in the latter half of the week, consolidating just below its recent peak while steadfastly holding above $100,000 for 20 consecutive days, underscoring persistent bullish momentum,\"" he said. Ether shows strength, analysts note Kruger also noted that Ethereum's ether shows signs of snapping its multi-year downtrend against BTC, as the corporate crypto treasury bonanza has reached the second-largest digital asset with SharpLink Gaming's (SBET) $425 million fundraising plan. Arthur Aziz, founder and investor of B2 Ventures, said that ETH is coiling for a breakout but warned of downside risks. Sharing his technical analysis in a note, he said the $2,750 level has posed significant barrier capping gains over the past weeks, while the $2,550-2,450 area emerged as a key support level. He noted that ETH is forming a bullish ascending triangle pattern, which historically preceded rallies to higher prices. \""The stage for a future $3,000 level breakout is being set right now,\"" he said. However, \""abusing\"" leverage in futures markets could trigger a \""sharp breakdown\"" below the $2,550-2,450 support zone in cascading selling.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/29/bitcoin-slides-below-106k-analyst-sees-ether-breakout-looming,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","Markets|Market Wrap|market analysis|Bitcoin|Ethereum|News",cryptocompare

2025-05-29T20:20:44.000Z,"97% of the U.S. government's $20.9B crypto reserve is in Bitcoin","The U.S. crypto reserves have been revealed to be 97% made up of Bitcoin, with Ethereum and stablecoins making up the remaining 3%. New data has shown that Bitcoin (BTC) makes up an overwhelming 97% of the United States’ newly centralized $20.9B cryptocurrency reserve . Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA), tokens that President Trump included in his strategic crypto reserve announcement, were noticeably missing from the reserve despite the earlier hype caused by the president’s initial pronouncements. These numbers, provided by blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, have given the public clarity as to what is inside of the U.S. government’s vaults following Trump’s executive order in March to formally create a national crypto reserve strategy. US crypto reserves revealed Though the Trump administration has not gone public with the official numbers, the data reviewed by The Washington Post indicates that the lion’s share of the United States’ seized and stored crypto is in Bitcoin — nearly $20.4B of the total. This concentration on Bitcoin sharply contrasts with the expectations Trump raised with his earlier statements. In a post on Truth Social made on March 2, the president name-dropped XRP, SOL, and ADA, consequently causing the value of those coins to spike, but now those same coins are absent from the actual reserve holdings. President Trump’s executive order created two new digital financial entities, the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile. The Bitcoin Reserve is essentially a digital Fort Knox meant to treat BTC like “digital gold,” according to Trump. The Digital Asset Stockpile, on the other hand, is a mix of whatever other crypto the government happens to seize, so its composition is unplanned and left to chance. Because the assets in both pools are primarily made up of cryptocurrency confiscated in civil or criminal proceedings, the government’s holdings reflect the coins most commonly involved in illicit activities, not necessarily the coins with the highest reputational value or the strongest developer communities As such, Bitcoin is overwhelmingly leading the reserve, followed by a smaller assortment of coins including Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT), Chainlink (LINK), WBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin), BNB (Binance Coin), DAI, UNI, TRX, and USDC, among others Stablecoins and wrapped tokens feature heavily in the treasury, while XRP, ADA, and SOL didn’t even make the top 20. Chainalysis suggests the current reserve figure is likely underestimating the full scope of government holdings, as the official audit and accounting process is still ongoing. The $20.9B estimate already places the U.S. government’s crypto assets just under the $25B value of the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve and well above its outdated gold reserve valuation, which would top $850B at current prices. Industry reaction to the report Previously, cryptocurrencies that were seized by agencies like the IRS or FBI were often sold off or returned to victims. Now, under Trump’s directive, they’re being stored as strategic assets much like one would oil or gold. The rate of lawsuits and regulatory probes has slowed under Trump’s administration, and crypto firms are now finding a friendlier environment to grow. But not everyone is thrilled by the reserve. Ethereum’s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, warned in a Washington Post interview that government involvement in crypto risks “violating crypto’s original mission of decentralization and openness.” Similarly, an NYU professor and crypto consultant, Austin Campbell, has called the reserve a potential contradiction to crypto’s core values. “Bitcoiners used to be about freedom from sovereign interference,” he said. “Now they’re cheering for a national stockpile?” Campbell also pointed out that the government could put the seized assets to better use, addressing the national debt or improving social programs. “Reserves make sense when you’re running a surplus,” he said. “Right now, they just make headlines.” Despite the criticism, states like New Hampshire and Arizona have passed legislation to create their own crypto stockpiles. Others, like Florida and Wyoming , opted not to create their own reserves due to their concerns about the volatility of cryptocurrencies.

2025-05-29T20:02:08.000Z,"Ethereum Developer Justin Drake Criticizes Bitcoin: “BTC Is a Ticking Time Bomb”","Justin Drake, one of the leading developers of Ethereum, has attracted attention in the cryptocurrency community with a long and remarkable explanation of Bitcoin's security model. In a post on social media, Drake described Bitcoin's proof-of-work (PoW) system as unsustainable and dangerous. Drake noted that Bitcoin transaction fees are at their lowest level in the last 13 years, and that daily transaction fees have dropped below 10 BTC. He said that although block rewards decrease after halving periods, the income from transaction fees still remains at 1%. “Low fees = low security budget = low security,” said Drake, arguing that Bitcoin’s security model is broken and this poses a systemic risk to the entire crypto ecosystem. Drake also criticized Bitcoin's 21 million supply limit, saying that this structure sabotages itself in the long run. He stated that if miners were to be supported only by transaction fees, revenues would decrease 100 times and even 1% of the existing mining infrastructure could take over Bitcoin with a 51% attack. Related News: BREAKING: Coinbase Futures Lists Highly Anticipated Altcoin - It Was Only a Matter of Time Unless transaction fees miraculously increase by 100 times, there are only two potential solutions for Bitcoin to survive, Drake said: Removal of the 21 million supply limit and introduction of an additional issuance mechanism called “tail issuance”. Switching to proof-of-stake (PoS) system. However, he noted that both of these suggestions are difficult to gain cultural acceptance within the Bitcoin community. Moreover, he stated that the “tail issuance” model will only work proactively, and will not work once Bitcoin is attacked. Drake also stated that projects such as Lightning Network, Ordinals, Stacks, and Liquid only provide short-term transaction fee increases, but long-term sustainability cannot be achieved. Drake also evaluated recent projects such as BitVM, and stated that such technologies may be vulnerable to 51% attacks, and therefore are far from being a solution. Drake's final message was clear: “Bitcoin’s PoW model is not sustainable. The math is against this system. If a fix is not made, at some point this system will break.” *This is not investment advice.

In a new strategy session, crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 789,600 followers on the social media platform X that it appears as if the layer-2 scaling solution Arbitrum ( ARB ) is primed to rise over the next 1-2 months. “The bullish divergence on ARB remains to be valid as it starts to make higher lows and higher highs. One to watch, and as we have this higher timeframe bullish divergence, it’s a good indicator that this one will do well in the coming 1-2 months.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X ARB is trading for $0.411 at time of writing, a 1.8% increase on the day. Moving on to the crypto king, the analyst says that he ultimately believes BTC will slowly grind upwards to a new all-time high (ATH). However, he notes that if it were to lose support at $107,000, it could see a sharp correction. “Level by level, Bitcoin continues to grind upwards. I think that we’ll continue to grind towards new ATHs, however, if this green block (support) is lost, you’ll see fast wicks occur. Quite standard, corrections are going to be volatile and with deep wicks as people tend to jump back into the asset in a fast manner. When can we expect one? If the level at $107,000 is lost.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X BTC is trading for $107,249 at time of writing, a marginal decrease on the day. Concluding his analysis with layer-1 blockchain and smart contract platform Sui Network, the trader says it’s recovering nicely after the FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) surrounding it after it got hacked to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars earlier this month. “SUI is strongly coming back after some FUD surrounding the Cetus exploit. The TVL (total value locked) has already bounced up with $300 million and is back to $1.8 billion TVL. I think that SUI remains to be a strong horse in the race of adoption and the stabilization on price proves this. Additionally, it’s outperforming Solana and I think that this will continue to be the case in the next 12-24 months. Just a normal consolidation.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X SUI is trading for $3.58 at time of writing, a marginal increase on the day.

2025-05-29T19:51:24.000Z,"Top 7 Best Long-Term Cryptos to Invest in for 2025","The world of cryptocurrency in 2025 is a combination of innovation, instability, and potential. Gone are those days when cryptocurrencies were considered a passing trend; today, they're at the heart of international finance and technology. For investors, the question is no longer whether to invest in cryptocurrency, but which coins have the staying power to weather market fluctuations and thrive in the years to come. Let's take a narrative journey through seven outstanding cryptocurrencies that the pundits and market trends suggest are best positioned for long-term strength and appreciation. Bitcoin (BTC — The Digital Gold Standard Bitcoin remains the unrivaled monarch of the cryptocurrency realm. As the pioneer and most recognizable cryptocurrency, it has endured regulatory crackdowns, market meltdowns, and incessant proclamations of its demise—only to emerge stronger each time. In 2025, Bitcoin's position as ”digital gold” is more concrete than ever, with institutional investors, sovereign wealth funds, and even governments holding BTC in their reserves. Market Cap: Over $2 trillion Price (May 2025): Around $109,000 Bitcoin's capped supply ensures scarcity, and its decentralized nature ensures security and transparency. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs and wider adoption as an inflation hedge have only fortified it. For a base asset in a crypto portfolio, Bitcoin is still the gold standard. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum transformed the blockchain ecosystem by enabling smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi), and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Its transition to Ethereum 2.0, via proof-of-stake and Layer 2 scaling solutions, has addressed the majority of the past issues like high fees and slow transactions. Market Cap: Over $300 billion Price (May 2025): Around $2,570 Ethereum's robust developer ecosystem and relentless innovation keep it at the forefront of blockchain technology. As more use cases are built on its network and institutional adoption increases, Ethereum's long-term future looks brighter than ever. Solana (SOL) Solana has become renowned for ultra-fast transactions and extremely low fees, making it a favorite among developers and users alike. Its ecosystem is vibrant, attracting projects from DeFi, NFTs, and even gaming. Market Cap: Over $90 billion Price (May 2025): Around $177–$370 (with predictions as high as $515) Solana's technological capabilities and active community have positioned it as one of Ethereum's largest competitors. As the network continues to expand and attract new users, Solana's future as a top blockchain looks increasingly guaranteed. Binance Coin (BNB) Binance Coin is the lifeblood of the Binance ecosystem, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB is used for trading fee discounts, token launches, and payments on Binance's growing array of products and services. Market Cap: Over $90 billion Price (May 2025): Around $673 Regular “burns” of BNB tokens reduce supply, potentially increasing value over time. Despite facing regulatory challenges, Binance’s global reach and innovation keep BNB in high demand, making it a compelling choice for long-term investors. XRP (Ripple) XRP is the power behind the Ripple network, which was developed for fast and cheap cross-border payments. Now that its long legal battle with the SEC has been resolved, XRP is returning to form, especially as banks and financial institutions seek efficient ways of moving money across borders. Market Cap: Over $130 billion Price (May 2025): Around $2.33–$2.34 (with bullish predictions up to $10) Ripple's partnerships and attempt to tokenize real-world assets could send XRP into massive demand. Regulatory clarity has removed a significant obstacle, clearing the way for broader adoption and growth. Dogecoin (DOGE) What started out as an internet joke has evolved into a cultural and financial phenomenon. Dogecoin's loyal community, celebrity endorsements, and increasing usage for payments have enabled it to remain in the game in a market filled with competition. Market Cap: Over $30 billion Price (May 2025): Around $0.23 While Dogecoin is more speculative than some of its rivals, its quirky mix of humor, community, and growing utility gives it surprising longevity. For those willing to take on some risk, Dogecoin offers entertainment value and potential upside. Cardano (ADA) Cardano takes a scientific, peer-reviewed approach to blockchain development that emphasizes scalability, sustainability, and interoperability. Its slow and steady approach may be lagging some rivals, but it has built a record of reliability and forward thinking. Market Cap: Over $27 billion Price (May 2025): Around $0.77 Through ongoing development and partnerships, especially in emerging markets, Cardano is laying the groundwork for mainstream acceptance. Its commitment to academic rigor and practical solutions places it in a strong position for long-term growth. Conclusion As the cryptocurrency market matures in 2025, these seven cryptocurrencies — Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Binance Coin, XRP, Dogecoin, and Cardano stand out for their survival, innovation, and prospects of long-term gains. Each has its own story: from Bitcoin as digital gold to Cardano's scientific approach. Building a long-term crypto portfolio is more about identifying projects with actual real-world use cases, good communities, and the ability to pivot and thrive. All of these cryptocurrencies have those qualities and are certainly worth considering as the revolution in digital assets continues.

In January 2024, the crypto OTC infrastructure firm Finery Markets reported that institutional OTC volumes jumped 106% last year.Cointelegraph approached Hidden Road for comment regarding the estimated OTC volumes globally and in the US, but had not received a response by the time of publication.Rising institutional demandIn December 2024, Higgins highlighted a rising demand for institutional balance sheets from large institutions in an interview with Finance Magnates.“Servicing them [institutional investors] across traditional finance and digital asset ecosystems that have already converged presents a really unique opportunity for us in the marketplace.”Hidden Road’s OTC swap launch in the US marks one of the first products launched by the firm since the company entered a definitive agreement to be acquired by Ripple.Related: Taurus, Parfin partnership to provide crypto infrastructure to institutionsSoon after the deal was announced, Hidden Road received a broker-dealer license from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, a private US corporation and self-regulatory organization regulating member brokerage firms and exchange markets.Hidden Road is also known as one of the first companies to receive a Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) license in Europe, immediately after the framework entered into full force on Dec. 30, 2024.

2025-05-29T13:30:00.000Z,"How African innovators are using blockchain to solve real problems","While blockchain headlines in the West often focus on speculation and regulation, in Africa, it’s a different story, one rooted in necessity, innovation and grassroots adoption. The latest episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast explores this ground-up revolution with Kevin Imani, head of StarkWare’s Africa Venture Studio, who shares how communities across the continent are using blockchain to tackle real-world problems in finance, energy and connectivity.A student movement“Young students were using blockchain before it was mainstream,” Imani explained. From Kenya to Nigeria, local needs, not hype, drove early adoption. In many cases, it was students receiving digital currencies from abroad or freelancers getting paid in dollars and struggling to convert funds into local currency. With limited banking infrastructure or trust in government institutions, decentralized alternatives offered a lifeline.Imani highlighted how centralized systems like Kenya’s E-Mpesa changed access to finance, but still fall short for international payments or off-ramping digital assets. Related: Blockchain.com expands in Africa as local crypto rules take shape“You have to start becoming a trader almost,” he said, describing the convoluted process of converting stablecoins or crypto earnings into usable local funds. This trust gap has fueled peer-to-peer crypto usage. “These were kids holding stablecoins not to spend them, but to store value.” Even before regulators or startups built formal infrastructure, communities had already found use cases for blockchain.Blockchain beyond finance Beyond finance, African innovators are tapping blockchain to address energy insecurity. In rural Zambia, excess power from a mini hydro station could go to waste. Instead, residents can now use that surplus to mine Bitcoin, for example, generating revenue and creating a sustainable power loop. “It’s self-sustaining and reduces waste,” Imani said.Connectivity is another frontier. In areas where traditional internet providers fall short, decentralized WiFi hotspot networks are emerging. With blockchain, community members can share bandwidth and be compensated instantly and transparently. “You don’t need a middleman. It’s fair and trackable,” he said.Still, mainstream adoption remains cautious. Governments like those in Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa are in “standby mode,” focused more on consumer protection than full-scale implementation. But Imani remains optimistic: “The need is there.

2025-05-29T13:23:06.000Z,"Tim Berners-Lee says internet DNS should have been more decentralized","World Wide Web and hypertext markup language (HTML) inventor Tim Berners-Lee said that if he were building a domain name service (DNS) today, he would make it “more decentralized.”Speaking at ETH Prague on stage alongside Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, Berners-Lee reflected on early internet architecture decisions.“If I could go back […] I would make it more decentralized,“ he said.DNS was invented in 1983 by Paul Mockapetris, replacing the previous hosts.txt file-based system with a scalable, distributed system for naming IP addresses. Still, while Berners-Lee was not personally responsible for DNS development, he could have opted for a URL structure not tied to the DNS we know today, or he could have pushed for a decentralized alternative. Source: Mely.ethRelated: Decentralized naming could bring ‘next billion’ users to BitcoinCentralization of the DNSThe DNS system is highly centralized, particularly at its top levels of hierarchy. The root zone, which governs top-level domains such as .com and .org, is managed by the US-based nonprofit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).Furthermore, the most authoritative servers are operated by a handful of organizations, further centralizing the system. This allows for easy censorship and control by governments that can unilaterally seize or block domain names.This degree of centralization also makes outages due to centralized service disruption more likely. Control over root zones and domain policies is also concentrated in a few regions and among a select group of stakeholders.There are also concerns regarding privacy because centralized DNS queries can be monitored, logged and intercepted by internet service providers and other intermediaries.Related: Community split on ENS petition against Unstoppable Domains patentCrypto’s solution to the problemDecentralized alternatives to the DNS system are being developed. The most well-known is the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), which maps human-readable names to Ethereum addresses, content on the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS), or other data.Another alternative is Unstoppable Domains. Its system mints domains as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Ethereum and Polygon.ENS has seen a fair share of adoption. In late 2024, ENS Labs also partnered with PayPal and Venmo, sparking speculation about how this partnership is likely to boost mainstream adoption.IPFS runs on Ethereum smart contracts and aims to be user-owned and censorship-resistant. Currently, it is primarily used in Web3 applications, wallets and decentralized websites.Another alternative is Handshake (HNS), which aims to be a decentralized and permissionless naming protocol that is compatible with traditional DNS. A project with a similar aim is Namecoin (NMC), an early Bitcoin fork designed specifically to offer .bit domains and store DNS records onchain with censorship resistance.IPFS is also accompanied by its own Inter-Planetary Name System (IPNS), which enables mutable naming for IPFS addresses (hashes). URLs generated this way point to specific content, not servers.A non-crypto alternative to DNS is OpenNIC. This is a user-run project that offers non-ICANN domains, aiming to decentralize control through community governance.Magazine: Move to Portugal to become a crypto digital nomad — Everybody else is",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/tim-berners-lee-says-dns-should-have-been-more-decentralized?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Ethereum Foundation turns to DeFi for cash","The Ethereum Foundation (EF) has borrowed $2 million in GHO, a decentralized stablecoin developed by Aave, in a move signaling deeper engagement with decentralized finance (DeFi) strategies.  In a May 29 X post, Aave founder Stani Kulechov said the foundation borrowed $2 million in GHO tokens. “The EF is not only supplying ETH to Aave, but also borrowing from Aave,” Kulechov wrote, describing the development as “the full DeFi circle.”GHO is a decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin native to the Aave Protocol. Unlike centralized stablecoins, GHO is governed by Aave’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which oversees interest rates, collateral requirements and facilitator selection. The move highlights the EF’s growing engagement with the DeFi ecosystem, moving toward more sophisticated treasury strategies. The foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Source: Stani KulechovEthereum Foundation previously deployed $120 million in DeFiThe foundation’s move to borrow GHO follows a previous $120 million deployment into various protocols, signaling a shift in how it manages its crypto holdings. In February, the EF deployed 45,000 Ether (ETH) across different DeFi protocols, including Aave, Spark and Compound. At the time, the Ether was worth $120 million. Kulechov previously described the fund deployment as the foundation’s “biggest allocation in DeFi.” Because of the move, the Aave founder said that DeFi will win, expressing optimism as the EF added liquidity to the protocol.Apart from Kulechov, community members also celebrated the move, supporting the EF’s ETH holdings management shift. A community member said the development was a win, saying the foundation should “keep it up,” while an X user said it would be positive if the EF continued to use their funds this way. Related: Ethereum Foundation unveils security initiative to supplant legacy systemsCriticisms of the foundation selling Ether In January, Ethereum community members called on the foundation to explore alternatives to selling ETH for operational funding. The community suggested DeFi tools like staking and borrowing stablecoins against ETH. Eric Conner, co-author of EIP-1559, criticized the ETH selling, saying that the foundation’s primary use case seemed to be dumping its holdings. He called the practice “insane,” urging the EF to stake or use DeFi instead of selling. Anthony Sassano, host of The Daily Gwei, proposed that the EF stake part of its ETH and sell the staking rewards.

Mainstream browsers will also integrate agentic capabilities or build interoperability with purpose-built agentic browsers as AI becomes cheaper, according to Zhu.However, the most significant adoption will come within the next decade when onchain and offchain environments will be completely merged for internet users, Zhu said, adding:“Agentic browsers are poised to become the default entry point — much like smartphones replaced feature phones.”In the long term, Donut aims to support payments, gaming, content creation and social interaction, all within a single crypto-native browser. The company also plans to leverage advancements in decentralized identity and confidential computing to turn the browser into a personal “crypto CFO” for retail users.

Over 82% of the token’s supply was held by a single entity, a major red flag for any cryptocurrency.Bubblemaps played a key role in uncovering suspicious wallet activity related to multiple memecoins, including the Melania token and an array of fake Eric Trump-themed memecoins.Related: Coinbase faces $400M bill after insider phishing attackUshering in the “InfoFi” era for Web3 usersBubblemaps said its tools help structured blockchain data become the foundation of “crypto’s next financial layer,” forming part of the growing information finance (InfoFi) era, bringing more powerful forensic tools to investors.“Solana proved that real-time transparency is no longer optional, it’s expected,” Vaiman said, adding:“This fits right into the InfoFi movement, giving users the tools to turn raw onchain data into clear, actionable information.”The platform is integrated with some of the most widely used protocols on Solana, including the memecoin launch platform Pump.fun, DEX Screener, Photon and Bullx, aiming to serve as the core analytics later for the Solana blockchain.Bubblemaps v2 is also available on Ethereum, BNB Chain, Base, Tron and ApeChain.Magazine: DeFi will rise again after memecoins die down: Sasha Ivanov, X Hall of Flame",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bubblemaps-time-travel-for-insider-activity-rug-pulls?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

CEO Leah Wald said the move supports the company’s long-term growth plans.“The filing of a base shelf prospectus supports our growth strategy by providing us with the flexibility to access capital as future opportunities arise in the rapidly evolving Solana ecosystem,” she said.Source: Sol StrategiesIn a May 28 announcement, Solana treasury firm DeFi Dev announced its adoption of Solana liquid staking tokens. The firm will now divert part of its Solana holdings to the liquid staking token dfdvSOL.The announcement followed DeFi Dev’s addition of 88,164 SOL to its treasury in late April, valued at $11.5 million at the time, when it held $34.4 million worth of Solana (SOL).Related: Solana chart hints at 180% rally to $300 if key technical trend holdsWhat is liquid staking?Liquid staking allows tokenholders to earn staking rewards without locking up their assets. Instead, they receive a liquid token that can be traded or used in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.  DeFi Dev expects the adoption of this technology to “enhance the company’s validator operations and treasury management, consistent with its mission to maximize SOL Per Share” growth. Chief investment officer and chief operating officer Parker White said:The adoption of dfdvSOL not only creates additional ways to drive stake to our validators and increase SOL holdings, but also advances our role as a long-term participant in the Solana ecosystem.”Related: Solana may be a memecoin ‘one-trick pony’ — Standard CharteredSol Strategies prepares to safeguard capitalSol Strategies also announced on May 28 that it had completed several key audits and certifications. The company passed SOC 2 Type 1 and SOC 1 Type 1 audits and received ISO 27001 certification for its Solana staking platform.  SOC 2 Type 1 is a report assessing a company’s controls related to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality or privacy at a specific point in time. Such an audit verifies that the firm’s controls meet trust service criteria at the time of the check.SOC 1 Type 1 is a similar report focused on internal controls over financial reporting at a specific point in time. This audit evaluates whether the controls are appropriately designed, but does not assess their effectiveness over time.Lastly, ISO 27001 is an international standard specifying requirements for an information security management system. These standards help manage risks pertaining to data confidentiality, integrity and availability through a continuous improvement framework.To obtain this ISO certificate, a company must demonstrate both the documentation and implementation of controls. Sol Strategies’ Wald explained that all these measures are meant to ensure institutional trust:“By achieving SOC 2 Type 1 and SOC 1 Type 1, alongside our ISO 27001 certification, we’ve demonstrated that institutional clients can trust SOL Strategies with their Solana staking needs.”The compliance efforts come as the firm continues to position itself as a major Solana validator.

Stablecoins like Tether USDt (USDT) and Circle’s USDC (USDC) ranked third with a share of 15.9%.Some local crypto enthusiasts observed that the actual figure of cryptocurrency held by Russians is significantly bigger than the estimated CEX holdings reported by the Bank of Russia.“I know that [Pavel] Durov and [Alexey] Bilyuchenko alone have more money in their wallets than this amount,” Sergey Mendeleev, founder of the digital settlement exchange Exved, wrote on his Telegram channel.

At current prices, the stash is valued at about $7.6 billion.Arkham said the newly identified wallets bring Strategy’s total identified holdings to $54.5 billion. If accurate, the findings suggest that Arkham has mapped out most of the company’s stash, making it the first entity to publicly associate the wallets with the firm. “Saylor said he would never reveal his addresses.

However, he added that the time he spent on DOGE wasn’t as significant as many believed, and he blamed media coverage for overrepresenting his involvement.“It’s not like I left the companies. It was just relative time allocation that probably was a little too high on the government side, and I’ve reduced that significantly in recent weeks.”When Musk announced in Tesla’s first quarter report that his time spent on DOGE would drop significantly in May, Tesla (TSLA) shares rose over 5% in after-hours trading, despite the company reporting an 80% drop in net income.As of March 31, Tesla still held 11,509 Bitcoin (BTC), currently valued at about $1.24 billion.Related: Musk confirms X Money beta testing ahead of planned 2025 launchTesla shares are still down 5.9% year to date, in part due to Musk diverting his attention away from the company and Tesla’s sales falling considerably in the first quarter.However, the fall is in line with other Big Tech firms, including Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG), which are also in the red in 2025.Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/elon-musk-leaves-doge-admit-tougher-than-expected?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

However, the altcoin has maintained a positive signal by closing above the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA) for three consecutive weeks. This critical level has historically acted as a catalyst for significant price rallies.Solana 1-week chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewIn late 2023, SOL broke through the 50-week and 100-week EMAs, solidifying its position above these levels before surging 515% by March 2024. The relative strength index or RSI on the weekly chart is currently at 52.60, indicating growing buying pressure. This setup mirrors past patterns where SOL broke above the 50-week EMA and rallied significantly. With current technicals aligning, SOL appears poised to retest the $300 level by late 2025, a key psychological and historical resistance.Using trend-based Fibonacci (FIB) extensions, SOL’s potential upside could be more compelling.

Elevated OI levels typically signal heightened speculative interest and suggest that traders are positioning for significant price volatility.Solana futures open interest. Source: CoinGlassFunding rates across exchanges have also turned negative, indicating a tilt toward short positions as SOL struggles to reclaim the key $180 resistance. While this often reflects bearish sentiment, it also opens the door for a potential short squeeze. Crypto futures analyst Byzantine General pointed out that current market conditions — characterized by elevated OI, rising aggregated volume, and relatively muted cross-exchange funding — suggest that SOL price may be stabilizing. He noted this setup could catalyze a sharp upside move, with the possibility of a breakout toward the $300 level if momentum builds.Solana price, aggregated open interest, volume, and funding rate.

Despite the recent gains, Ether is down 21% in 2025, while the broader cryptocurrency market has seen a 5% increase.Ether bulls are motivated to keep ETH above $2,600 ahead of the monthly expiry. However, weak network activity on Ethereum suggests that the upside potential may be limited.Ether/USD (blue) vs. Total crypto capitalization (green). Source: TradingView / CointelegraphAnalysts believe Ether’s underperformance stems from rising competition among blockchains focused on decentralized applications. Still, ETH holds a key advantage as the only altcoin with a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) offering in the United States. These ETFs attracted $287 million in net inflows between May 19 and May 27, reflecting increased interest from institutional investors.Even as demand for Ether-based investment products grows, deposits and onchain activity on the Ethereum network have declined. This trend is especially troubling as rivals like Solana, BNB Chain, and Tron continue to gain market share.

Source: Laevitas.chEven though the $1.3 billion in call (buy) options dominate the May 30 expiry, that doesn’t necessarily imply that those traders will reinvest the proceeds in new bullish positions. Many option strategies involve multiple maturities and are structured in ways that don’t benefit from ETH rising above specific thresholds. Additionally, traders may hedge their exposure through futures markets.The $1.1 billion in put (sell) options were clearly caught off guard, as 97% were set at $2,600 or lower. These contracts will expire worthless if ETH holds above that level at 8:00 am UTC on May 30. While this imbalance is unusual, a similar outcome could affect the overly optimistic call options with strike prices at $2,800 and above if ETH remains near current levels.Related: SharpLink launches Ethereum treasury, taps Joe Lubin as board chairBelow are four likely scenarios based on current price trends.

2025-05-28T21:22:22.000Z,"Bitcoin analyst says BTC price peak in $220K to $330K range still possible","Key takeaways:Bitcoin researcher Sminston With says BTC could gain 100% to 200%, with a cycle peak between $220,000 to $330,000.Bitcoin continues to exhibit strong cyclical volatility, contradicting the belief that its price swings are softening over time.Over $4 billion in BTC has been moved by long-term holders, warning of a price correction.Analysis from Bitcoin (BTC) researcher Sminston With implied that a BTC price peak is still 100% to 200% away from current prices. In a recent X post, With shared a Bitcoin price chart using a 365-day simple moving average (SMA) aligned with a power law model (R²=0.96). The model suggests Bitcoin’s price follows a predictable, non-random pattern over time, distinct from the exponential growth models often applied to stocks and equities.Bitcoin power law fit analysis by Sminston With. Source: XThe chart revealed that Bitcoin’s 365-day SMA typically peaks 2 to 3 times above the power law trendline in each market cycle. With Bitcoin priced at $110,000 on May 27, this model projects a potential cycle top between $220,000 and $330,000. This forecast aligns with historical patterns, where Bitcoin has consistently overshot this trendline during bullish phases, offering an optimistic outlook for investors.A second graph in the post highlights Bitcoin’s price deviation from the power law fit, showing steady cyclical volatility without exponential decay in sustained peaks. This challenges the common belief that Bitcoin’s price cycles are becoming less extreme over time, indicating that the cryptocurrency’s volatility remains a defining trait, potentially leading to significant price swings over the next few months. In Q3 2024, With accurately predicted that Bitcoin would reach a six-figure price by January 2025, when BTC was trading around $60,000. The analysis examined each decaying peak by assessing BTC’s price at cycle highs. A decaying period in an investment cycle occurs when a strategy’s returns decline as the opportunity becomes widely adopted, culminating in a peak where the asset’s value drops sharply, leading to mass profit-taking.With’s quarter-on-quarter price targets for 2025, as outlined in this analysis, are summarized below.Bitcoin returns in 2025 based on decaying peaks.
