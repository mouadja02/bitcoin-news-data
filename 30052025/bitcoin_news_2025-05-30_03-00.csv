2025-05-30T00:50:03.000Z,"Twenty One Secures $100M Boost, Advances Toward Pivotal SPAC Merger","BitcoinWorld Twenty One Secures $100M Boost, Advances Toward Pivotal SPAC Merger The world of digital assets is constantly evolving, marked by significant moves from institutional players. A recent development that has captured attention is the latest funding round for Twenty One , a prominent Bitcoin treasury firm. The company has successfully raised an additional $100 million, pushing its total capital raised to an impressive $685 million. This news comes as the firm makes significant strides towards a major SPAC merger , signaling growing confidence in the institutional adoption of digital assets and highlighting the potential for substantial Cryptocurrency Investment in structured financial products. Twenty One’s Funding Milestone: Reaching $685 Million The additional $100 million was secured through convertible senior secured notes. This type of financing allows investors to potentially convert their debt into equity at a later date, often under specific conditions. According to CoinDesk, this recent infusion of capital stems from existing investors and sponsors exercising options that were part of an earlier fundraising round in April. Key details of the financing include: Amount Raised: An additional $100 million. Financing Instrument: Convertible senior secured notes. Total Capital: Brings Twenty One’s total capital raised to $685 million. Source: Existing investors and sponsors exercising April options. Note Terms: 1% coupon rate, due in 2030. This substantial fundraising underscores strong investor belief in Twenty One’s strategy and future prospects, particularly as a leading Digital Asset Firm focused on treasury management involving Bitcoin . Navigating the Path to Public Markets: The SPAC Merger with CEP Beyond the funding news, Twenty One is actively progressing towards a merger with Nasdaq-listed Cantor Equity Partners (CEP). The chosen route for this significant corporate event is a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) merger structure. What is a SPAC merger? A SPAC, often called a “blank check company,” is a firm with no commercial operations that is formed solely to raise capital through an initial public offering (IPO) for the purpose of acquiring or merging with an existing company. For a private company like Twenty One, merging with a listed SPAC offers an alternative path to becoming a publicly traded entity compared to a traditional IPO. The strategic rationale behind this SPAC merger with a reputable financial institution like CEP is clear. It provides Twenty One with: Public Listing: Access to public capital markets. Enhanced Credibility: Association with a long-standing financial player like Cantor Equity Partners. Increased Visibility: Greater exposure to institutional and retail investors. This move is a significant step for a Digital Asset Firm seeking mainstream financial integration. Twenty One’s Strategy: A Focus on Bitcoin and Treasury Management Twenty One positions itself as a Bitcoin treasury firm. This implies a focus on holding and managing significant amounts of Bitcoin as part of its corporate treasury strategy, potentially similar to other public companies that have adopted Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Led by Brandon Lutnick, the firm’s actions suggest a strong conviction in Bitcoin as a long-term store of value and a strategic asset. This is further evidenced by their disclosed $458 million Bitcoin acquisition earlier this month. Such substantial acquisitions by institutional players are closely watched indicators of increasing institutional confidence and can influence overall sentiment around Cryptocurrency Investment . What Does This Mean for Cryptocurrency Investment and the Market? The developments surrounding Twenty One , its significant fundraising, and its impending SPAC merger with Cantor Equity Partners carry broader implications for the digital asset landscape and Cryptocurrency Investment : Institutional Validation: Large fundraising rounds and mergers involving established financial names signal growing institutional acceptance and integration of digital assets. M&A Trend: This highlights a potential trend of mergers and acquisitions as digital asset firms seek scale, regulatory clarity, and access to traditional financial markets. Maturation of the Space: The use of sophisticated financial instruments like convertible notes and structures like SPACs indicates the increasing maturity of the digital asset industry. Focus on Bitcoin: Twenty One’s clear focus on Bitcoin treasury management reinforces the narrative of Bitcoin as a potential corporate reserve asset. For investors interested in the institutional side of crypto, Twenty One’s journey provides a compelling case study of how a Digital Asset Firm is navigating growth and seeking integration with traditional finance. Conclusion Twenty One’s successful raising of an additional $100 million, bringing its total capital to $685 million, is a significant financial milestone. Coupled with the active progress towards a SPAC merger with Nasdaq-listed Cantor Equity Partners, these events underscore the firm’s ambitious growth trajectory and the increasing convergence of traditional finance and the digital asset world. As a dedicated Bitcoin treasury firm, Twenty One’s strategic moves, including its recent substantial Bitcoin acquisition, reflect a strong commitment to digital assets. This progression is a positive indicator for the broader landscape of institutional Cryptocurrency Investment and the continued evolution of the Digital Asset Firm ecosystem.

2025-05-30T00:45:05.000Z,"SHOCK: Hyperliquid Whale Faces Potential $5.4M Bitcoin Loss","BitcoinWorld SHOCK: Hyperliquid Whale Faces Potential $5.4M Bitcoin Loss The world of cryptocurrency trading is often characterized by high volatility and even higher stakes, especially for those employing significant leverage. Recently, attention has been drawn to a prominent Hyperliquid whale trader, identified as James Wynn, who is reportedly facing a substantial unrealized loss on a large Bitcoin position. What Happened to the Hyperliquid Whale’s Bitcoin Long? According to data shared by HypurrScan and cited by JinSe Finance, James Wynn, known for his significant trading activity on the Hyperliquid platform, holds a substantial Bitcoin long position. This position, however, is currently underwater, facing an unrealized loss estimated at a staggering $5.4 million. The details surrounding this specific trade highlight the inherent risks associated with high leverage: Trader: James Wynn (a known Hyperliquid whale) Platform: Hyperliquid Asset: Bitcoin (BTC) Position Type: Long (betting on price increase) Leverage: 40x Current Situation: Facing an unrealized loss of approximately $5.4 million An ‘unrealized loss’ means the position is currently losing money based on the market price, but the loss isn’t locked in unless the position is closed or, critically, liquidated. Understanding Leveraged Trading and Liquidation Price This situation brings the concepts of leveraged trading and the liquidation price into sharp focus. Leveraged trading allows traders to control a large position with a relatively small amount of capital. In this case, 40x leverage means James Wynn is trading a Bitcoin position 40 times larger than the initial margin (collateral) he put down. While leverage can significantly amplify profits if the market moves favorably, it equally magnifies losses when the market moves against the position. The higher the leverage, the smaller the price movement required to wipe out the initial margin. This is where the liquidation price becomes critical. The liquidation price is the specific market price at which a leveraged position is automatically closed by the exchange to prevent the trader’s losses from exceeding their margin. For James Wynn’s 40x Bitcoin long, the reported liquidation price is set at $106,340. This means if the price of Bitcoin were to drop to this level, Hyperliquid would automatically close his position, realizing the full loss and potentially more, depending on market conditions during liquidation. For a 40x long position, a relatively small percentage drop in the price of Bitcoin can lead to liquidation. Conversely, a 40x short position would face liquidation if the price rose significantly. Why Do Traders Use Such High Leverage? Given the immense risk, one might wonder why traders, especially large ones like a Hyperliquid whale , would use such high leverage like 40x. The primary reason is the potential for outsized returns. Consider this: Without leverage, a 1% increase in Bitcoin price yields a 1% profit on the invested capital. With 40x leverage, a mere 0.25% increase in Bitcoin price could theoretically yield a 10% profit on the initial margin (0.25% * 40 = 10%). This potential to generate significant profits from small price movements attracts aggressive traders. However, the flip side is equally true: a small adverse price movement can lead to rapid and substantial losses, including the loss of the entire initial margin upon reaching the liquidation price . The Implications of a Large Crypto Loss A potential crypto loss of $5.4 million is significant, even for a whale trader. While whales often have deep pockets and can withstand large losses, an event like this highlights the extreme volatility and risk present in the crypto markets, particularly on perpetual futures platforms like Hyperliquid. For the individual trader, reaching the liquidation price means their entire margin for that position is gone. For the platform and other traders, a large liquidation can sometimes add selling pressure to the market, although sophisticated platforms like Hyperliquid have mechanisms designed to minimize market impact. This situation serves as a stark reminder: High leverage is a double-edged sword. Market conditions can change rapidly, turning profitable positions into losing ones quickly. Liquidation is a real and present danger in leveraged trading. Lessons for Traders from This Hyperliquid Whale Situation While the scale of a Hyperliquid whale ‘s position is far beyond that of most retail traders, the principles and risks remain the same. This event offers valuable lessons: Understand Leverage: Never use leverage you don’t fully comprehend. Know the exact price point where your position will be liquidated. Risk Management is Key: Always trade with a stop-loss order to limit potential losses before the liquidation price is reached. Only risk a small percentage of your total trading capital on any single trade. Start Small: If you’re new to leveraged trading, begin with very low leverage (e.g., 2x-5x) to understand the dynamics before considering higher amounts. Volatility Matters: Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are highly volatile assets. High leverage combined with high volatility dramatically increases the risk of rapid liquidation. Don’t Blindly Follow Whales: While tracking large traders can offer insights, their risk tolerance and capital reserves are vastly different from yours. A loss they can absorb could be catastrophic for a smaller trader. The potential crypto loss faced by James Wynn underscores that even experienced, large-scale traders are not immune to the inherent risks of the market and the amplified dangers of high leverage. Conclusion: A Cautionary Tale of High Stakes Bitcoin Longs The situation involving the Hyperliquid whale James Wynn and his substantial unrealized loss on a 40x Bitcoin long serves as a powerful cautionary tale. It vividly illustrates the immense potential rewards and, more importantly, the catastrophic risks associated with high-stakes leveraged trading in the volatile cryptocurrency market. With a reported liquidation price of $106,340 looming, the outcome of this specific position remains uncertain. However, the event itself provides a crucial reminder for all traders: understand your tools, manage your risk diligently, and be acutely aware of the price points that could lead to a significant crypto loss . In the world of high leverage, the margin for error is incredibly thin. To learn more about the latest crypto market trends, explore our article on key developments shaping Bitcoin price action.

2025-05-30T00:12:14.000Z,"House Republicans introduce digital asset market clarity act","House Republicans, led by Financial Services Committee Chairman French Hill (R-AR), have introduced the bipartisan Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act. Co-sponsored by eight other members of Congress—five Republicans and three Democrats—the legislation aims to establish a clear regulatory framework for digital assets in the United States. The CLARITY Act establishes how the United States should treat cryptocurrencies and digital assets. For years, the crypto industry has thrived in a legal gray zone. The absence of clear rules has confused and stifled innovation . This bill is meant to change that. It is a follow-up to last year’s Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), but it further lays out oversight duties. Representative Dusty Johnson said that America was poised to lead the world in the digital assets market but emphasized that this could not happen without a clear regulatory framework. The bill is long and is expected to be the focus of extensive negotiations among the two parties and chambers. In the meantime, it is a strong step forward for crypto legislation in Congress. Key provisions target market oversight The Clarity Act assigns most of the responsibility for supervising crypto trading markets to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The bill confers “exclusive regulatory jurisdiction” on the CFTC for digital commodity spot markets — the areas where commonly used assets such as Bitcoin trade. Meanwhile, the SEC will continue to oversee digital assets classified as securities —those you invest in with the expectation of profiting from the efforts of others. According to this structure, crypto firms would be free to register with the CFTC or the SEC, depending on the digital assets they work with. The bill tenures provisional registration for crypto firms to begin operating while agencies work out the regulations. It also requires platforms to follow anti-money laundering rules outlined in the Bank Secrecy Act. For example, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and wallet providers will be excluded from SEC oversight in some cases. The Clarity Act, if implemented, would allow regulators only 12 months to promulgate rules. That timeline is relatively short in the arcane realm of financial rule-making, which can frequently drag on for years. Congress sparks debate with Clarity Act introduction The Clarity Act comes at a moment of increasing political fascination with crypto and pressure to regulate. Whereas the stablecoin bill is considered further along the track, this latest attempt targets larger market structure issues. The measure is backed heavily by House Republicans, particularly those on the Financial Services and Agriculture Committees. But its future is uncertain. Democrats are divided. Some worry the bill is overly friendly to the crypto industry. Others worry about links between crypto firms and Donald Trump, who has recently re-emerged in the political world. Still, a handful of Democrats have backed clear crypto standards — particularly if they safeguard consumers. The crypto industry, beyond Congress, is paying close attention. The bill has won praise from the crypto advocacy group Stand with Crypto. They describe it as a “big step forward” when providing companies and developers the legal certainty they need to do business in the U.S. Some experts suspect the bill and stablecoin legislation could eventually be bundled into a single package. That would produce an even broader crypto law — possibly the first in the United States. President Trump has urged Congress to pass both bills by August, before the congressional recess. But inside sources say that’s a highly ambitious goal. There will be hearings on the new bill next week. Members of Congress will also have an opportunity to publicly debate what’s in it, amendments, and the way forward.

2025-05-30T00:10:59.000Z,"Jack Mallers aims for Saylor’s crown with billion-dollar Bitcoin bet","At the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Strike’s CEO, Jack Mallers, unveiled an ambitious strategy to rival Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin dominance. As the chief executive officer of one of the most talked-about ventures in digital assets — Twenty-One Capital Inc., Mallers aims to reshape corporate Bitcoin holdings and challenge Saylor’s firm, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), which currently holds over 580,000 BTC, valued at approximately $64 billion. Jack Mallers aims for Saylor’s crown with billion-dollar Bitcoin bet Twenty-One is supported by the investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald LP, stablecoin powerhouse Tether Holdings SA, and the Japanese investment firm SoftBank Group. The company is not simply following the ever-expanding list of businesses chasing after the opportunity to imitate Strategy , Michael Saylor’s software firm that has been transformed into a leveraged proxy for Bitcoin — it is trying to beat it. Twenty-One Capital, backed by notable entities including Tether and Cantor Fitzgerald, recently disclosed a $458 million Bitcoin acquisition. The firm plans to publish its Bitcoin addresses to verify its reserves, emphasizing transparency in its operations. In contrast, Michael Saylor’s Strategy continues its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation, recently purchasing an additional 4,020 BTC, bringing its total holdings to over 580,000 BTC. Mallers envisions Twenty-One Capital acquiring up to 5% of Bitcoin’s total supply, approximately 1 million BTC, signaling a bold ambition to rival Saylor. Many people outside the crypto community have recognized Jack Mallers mostly for being emotional in 2021 when he announced that Bitcoin would become legal tender in El Salvador at the biggest conference in Miami. How Mallers ended up as the leader of Twenty One may be as interesting as Mallers’s story about turning El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele onto Bitcoin. Mallers narrates his journey to explore Bitcoin Mallers explained that his path to Twenty-One went through Tether Holdings SA CEO Paolo Ardoino, who has known Mallers since his early days in Bitcoin. Mallers began revealing his exploration of Bitcoin. He explained that he grew up in and around traditional finance and was first exposed to Bitcoin in 2013 when his father co-founded and sold a discount futures brokerage. Apart from his father, his stepmother is deep in the crypto world, known as BitcoinMom on X. Mallers dropped out of college and founded Zap Solutions Inc., Strike’s parent company, when he was 23. Mallers also revealed that Tether’s sister company, Bitfinex, was the first major exchange to implement the Lightning Network. He continued by saying that he was one of the most vocal early developers of the Lightning Network, referring to the Bitcoin payment protocol. “And so Paolo and I would talk, and that was à la 2017,” the CEO of Strike concluded. In the meantime, Tether was establishing a deeper relationship with Cantor Fitzgerald, the investment bank that US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick led before he was recruited to work as part of President Donald Trump’s executive staff. Cantor helps oversee Tether’s reserves and holds a convertible bond with the largest Stablecoin operator. Lutnick has helped transform Tether, a firm formerly eyed with suspicion by Washington, into an unlikely ally of the president. Due to Cantor’s ties with Trump, Mallers mentioned that Tether is the only link between him and the bank and Lutnick, whose son Brandon currently manages the company. He admitted that he did not know Brandon well, but he was his banker. Crypto investors prefer Mallers to Saylor as a perfect choice for Twenty-One Mallers and Tether crossed each other’s paths over the years, including overlapping in El Salvador, where Strike and Tether now have headquarters. When Mallers launched Strike in El Salvador in 2021, it became the most downloaded app in the country. Strike first relied on Tether’s USDT stablecoin as a substitute for the dollar, but it quickly dumped USDT in favor of partnerships with banks in El Salvador. In 2023, Strike started adding Tether again to its platform. However, it was not until the end of last year when the concept for Twenty- One began to take shape, Mallers said. Mallers remembers meeting Tether and their team in November at a Plan B Forum, a conference co-hosted by the Swiss city of Lugano and Tether. “We had a smart conversation about the direction of the world, their plans, and my plans,” Mallers said. For many people, Mallers is an appealing choice to lead Twenty-One because he is so frank about his defense of Bitcoin. Whereas Saylor frequently appears as a serious businessperson, Mallers comes across with the “crypto bro” appeal that is quite attractive to retail crypto investors. Additionally, Mallers, like many online influencers, is active on his YouTube channel, where he uploads videos and hosts a weekly podcast about Bitcoin and the financial systems called The Jack Mallers Show. Mark Palmer, a senior analyst for fintech and digital assets at Benchmark, also stated that although Michael Saylor’s role as a promoter of Strategy and Bitcoin had been incredibly helpful, Jack Mallers, who is a charming person and famous in the crypto world, is a great choice to promote both Twenty-One Capital and Bitcoin.

According to market data from Coingecko, AVAX, which had a fully diluted valuation of about $10.2 billion and a 24 hour average trading volume of around $610 million, dropped nearly 4 percent in the past 24 hours to trade around $22.44 at the time of this writing. What Happened to Avalanche Fundamentals The Avalanche network has grown to a vibrant web3 ecosystem with more than $1.5 billion in total value locked (TVL) and nearly $2 billion in stablecoins market cap. The mainstream adoption of the Avalanche network by institutional investors has been bolstered by the notable development of its ecosystem’s tokenization technology. As a result, the Avalanche network has achieved more than 46k active daily on-chain users. Meanwhile, several fund managers – led by VamEck, and Grayscale Investments – are seeking to offer spot AVAX ETFs in the United States in the near future. AVAX Price Expectations In the weekly timeframe, AVAX price has been recovering from the 2022 crypto bear market. The utility-focuses altcoin has been forming a macro bullish continuation since March 2024, which is characterized by a falling symmetrical channel in the weekly timeframe. In the four hour timeframe, AVAX price has been forming a symmetric triangular pattern in the past four weeks. AVAX price has respected a rising logarithmic trend established since April 9, thus signaling a bullish continuation pattern. According to on-chain data , AVAX price has established a robust support level above $22.8, especially after 362k wallets accumulated more than 21.65 million AVAX coins. Consequently, a consistent close beyond the liquidity level above $25 will trigger a fresh rejuvenated rally toward the target range between $35 and $55.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/avalanche-avax-price-analysis-and-short-term-forecast/,"ALTCOIN|AVAX|BTC|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis|Altcoins",cryptocompare
2025-05-30T00:05:44.000Z,"Bitcoin: Explosive Upside Ahead? 5 Key Signals Pointing Higher","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin: Explosive Upside Ahead? 5 Key Signals Pointing Higher Is the stage set for the next big move in the Bitcoin price ? Recent analysis suggests several powerful forces are aligning, potentially driving the premier cryptocurrency to new heights. If you’re watching the crypto market , understanding these underlying dynamics is crucial. A deep dive into on-chain and technical data reveals five compelling signals that point towards continued upside potential for Bitcoin . These factors aren’t just isolated events; they represent shifts in market structure and investor behavior that have historically preceded significant price appreciation. Let’s break down what these signals are and why they matter for the future trajectory of Bitcoin . Signal 1: Sustained Whale Accumulation One of the most telling signs of smart money confidence is the behavior of large holders, often referred to as ‘whales’. These entities control vast amounts of Bitcoin and their movements can significantly influence market dynamics. Recent data indicates a sustained pattern of accumulation by these large wallets. What does this mean? Reduced Supply on Exchanges: When whales move Bitcoin off exchanges into cold storage, it signals an intent to hold for the long term, reducing the readily available supply for selling. Confidence in Future Price: Accumulation suggests these large players believe the current price is attractive and expect it to rise considerably in the future. They aren’t selling into strength; they’re buying dips or accumulating steadily. Market Strength: Sustained buying pressure from large players provides a strong foundation for price support. This consistent absorption of supply by whales is a fundamental bullish signal, suggesting strong hands are positioning for significant gains. Signal 2: Strong Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETF products, particularly in the United States, has been a game-changer for the crypto market . These vehicles provide traditional investors with an accessible and regulated way to gain exposure to Bitcoin . The inflows into these ETFs have been substantial and consistent. Here’s why this is bullish: New Capital Injection: ETFs bring significant new capital into the market that might otherwise not have directly invested in Bitcoin . This includes institutional funds, wealth managers, and retail investors using traditional brokerage accounts. Demand Exceeding Supply: The rate at which these ETFs are buying Bitcoin to back their shares often exceeds the rate at which new Bitcoin is mined daily. This creates a supply shock dynamic. Validation and Legitimacy: The success and adoption of Bitcoin ETF s lend further legitimacy to Bitcoin as an asset class, potentially attracting even more conservative investors over time. The sustained demand from the ETF sector is a powerful engine driving the Bitcoin price higher by absorbing available supply. Signal 3: Elevated Investor Sentiment Market psychology plays a significant role in price movements. While not a fundamental driver, elevated investor sentiment can fuel momentum and extend rallies. Various metrics, from social media trends to survey data and funding rates in derivatives markets, suggest sentiment remains broadly positive towards Bitcoin . Why is positive sentiment important? Increased Participation: Positive sentiment encourages more people to buy, from retail investors entering the market to existing holders increasing their positions. Reduced Selling Pressure: When sentiment is high, holders are less likely to sell on minor price dips, leading to more resilient price action. Self-Fulfilling Prophecy: In the short to medium term, widespread belief in a rising market can contribute to that rise as buying activity increases. While sentiment can be fickle, its current elevated state indicates a general bullish outlook across the crypto market , supporting the potential for continued price increases. Signal 4: Rising Open Interest Despite All-Time Highs Open interest refers to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts (like futures or options) that have not been settled. Typically, when an asset reaches new all-time highs, open interest might decline as traders take profits or close positions. However, in the current cycle, open interest in Bitcoin derivatives has remained elevated or continued to climb even as the price reaches record levels. What does this signal? New Money Entering: High open interest at highs suggests new positions are being opened, not just old ones being rolled over or closed. This indicates fresh capital and new market participants are entering the derivatives space, often with bullish bets. Confidence in Continuation: Traders are willing to take on leveraged positions even at high prices, implying confidence that the rally is not over. Potential for Volatility: While bullish, high open interest also increases the potential for large price swings due to liquidations if the market moves sharply in one direction. This metric, analyzed alongside funding rates, provides insight into the leverage and conviction within the market, and current readings suggest a strong belief in further upside. Signal 5: Potential Short Liquidations Above $111,000 The derivatives market isn’t just about bullish bets. Many traders take short positions, betting on the price to fall. Data on liquidation levels shows where these short positions would be forced to close if the price rises, potentially triggering a cascade of buying. Analysis points to significant clusters of short positions that could face liquidation if Bitcoin surpasses levels between $111,000 and $115,000. Why is this a bullish signal? Liquidation Cascades: When the price hits these levels, automated systems force short sellers to buy Bitcoin to cover their positions. This sudden buying pressure can rapidly accelerate the price increase. Fuel for the Rally: These forced buys act as fuel, pushing the price higher and potentially triggering further liquidations at even higher levels. Weakening Opposition: Liquidating short positions removes market participants betting against the price rise, reducing selling pressure. The presence of these potential liquidation zones above current price levels creates a technical setup where a move higher could gain rapid momentum, helping propel the Bitcoin price towards and potentially beyond these targets. Putting It All Together: A Broader Bull Cycle Individually, each of these five signals provides a piece of the puzzle. Taken together, as highlighted by the Cointelegraph analysis of on-chain data and technical indicators, they paint a compelling picture of a market structure geared for further appreciation. Sustained whale accumulation reduces supply, robust Bitcoin ETF inflows create consistent demand, elevated sentiment encourages participation, high open interest shows conviction, and potential short liquidations offer technical upside fuel. The report suggests this isn’t just a temporary bounce, but rather that Bitcoin is firmly entrenched in a broader bull cycle. This cycle is characterized by fundamental shifts in adoption, market infrastructure (like ETFs), and increasing confidence from both retail and institutional players. Price Targets: $120,000+ and Beyond? Based on these bullish signals and the broader market context, the analysis indicates a strong likelihood of Bitcoin surpassing the $120,000 mark in the first half of 2025. Furthermore, the potential exists for the price to reach as high as $200,000 by the end of 2025. It’s important to remember that price targets are projections based on current data and market conditions. The path to these levels is unlikely to be a straight line, and volatility is inherent in the crypto market . However, the confluence of these five bullish factors provides a data-driven basis for these optimistic forecasts. What Does This Mean for Investors? For those participating in or watching the crypto market , these signals offer valuable insights: Actionable Insights: Monitor On-Chain Data: Keep an eye on metrics like exchange reserves, whale wallet movements, and long-term holder behavior. Track ETF Flows: Watch weekly or monthly reports on Bitcoin ETF inflows to gauge institutional and traditional investor demand. Understand Sentiment: While not a primary driver, sentiment indicators can help understand market psychology and potential short-term swings. Be Aware of Liquidation Levels: Understanding where significant liquidation clusters lie can help anticipate potential areas of accelerated price movement. Consider Long-Term Perspective: The analysis points to a broader bull cycle, suggesting that focusing on the long-term trend rather than short-term volatility may be beneficial. Potential Benefits: Significant price appreciation for existing holders. Opportunities for new investors to participate in a potentially growing market. Further maturation and mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin as an asset class. Potential Challenges: Market volatility means significant price swings are possible. External factors (regulatory news, macroeconomic shifts) can impact the market. Reaching price targets is not guaranteed and depends on the continued strength of these signals and overall market conditions. Conclusion: A Bullish Outlook Supported by Data The convergence of sustained whale accumulation , strong Bitcoin ETF inflows, positive investor sentiment, rising open interest at highs, and technical liquidation zones above current levels presents a powerful case for continued upside in the Bitcoin price . These signals, derived from detailed on-chain data and technical analysis, suggest the current market environment is robust and poised for further growth. While no market move is guaranteed, the weight of evidence points towards a high probability that Bitcoin is set to climb higher, with targets of $120,000 and potentially $200,000 appearing increasingly plausible within the next year and a half. For anyone interested in the future of finance and digital assets, keeping a close watch on these key indicators is essential.

2025-05-30T00:00:53.000Z,"Ethereum Tests Key Weekly Resistance – Analyst Sets $4K Target If ETH Breaks Out","Ethereum is taking the lead in the crypto market as Bitcoin continues to consolidate near its all-time highs. After months of lagging behind BTC, ETH is now making a strong move, with bulls pushing price action toward the critical $2,800 resistance. This level, which has consistently capped upside momentum since early February, now stands as the key battleground for Ethereum’s next major leg. Related Reading: Altseason Loading? Analyst Explains How FTX $5B Distribution May Trigger The Next Bull Leg Market sentiment has shifted as Ethereum shows signs of reclaiming dominance, driven by renewed spot demand and strengthening technicals. Top analyst Ted Pillows has weighed in on the rally, emphasizing the importance of the $2,850 mark. According to Pillows, this is the most significant resistance Ethereum has faced in this cycle, and breaking through it could unlock a powerful move toward $3,000 and beyond. Momentum has been building steadily over the past few weeks, and ETH’s recent resilience against macroeconomic pressure is adding to the conviction. If bulls manage to flip this resistance into support, it could mark the beginning of a broader altcoin surge. For now, all eyes are on Ethereum as it flirts with a breakout that could reshape market dynamics heading into June. Ethereum Eyes Expansion Phase Amid Shifting Global Dynamics Ethereum is positioning itself for a potentially expansive move as both technical indicators and market sentiment continue to align in its favor. After weeks of consolidation and steady gains, ETH is now testing the $2,850 resistance—a level that has held price down since February. The setup suggests that Ethereum is not only regaining momentum but could also lead the next phase of the crypto rally. While the crypto market gains traction, broader macroeconomic forces are reshaping investor behavior. A recent decision by the U.S. Federal court to strike down former President Trump’s tariffs on various countries has created fresh uncertainty across global markets. This policy reversal could introduce volatility in traditional finance, as trade dynamics shift and new fiscal responses take shape. Despite this uncertainty, Ethereum appears to be thriving. There’s a view that crypto assets like ETH could perform well under tight economic conditions, and current price action supports that view. ETH is showing resilience, supported by growing spot demand, a bullish structure, and rising investor confidence. Pillows highlighted in his latest analysis that if Ethereum reclaims the $2,850 level in the coming sessions, the path to $4,000 will open quickly. This would represent a major breakout and likely trigger a wave of capital rotation from Bitcoin and stablecoins into altcoins. For now, ETH remains just below a breakout point. If bulls can push decisively above resistance, it would confirm the start of an expansionary move that could reshape the broader market, positioning Ethereum as a leading force in the next phase of the cycle. Related Reading: Dogecoin Flashes Buy Signal – Key Indicator Hints At Rebound ETH Reclaims Weekly Key Levels Ethereum is showing renewed strength on the weekly chart, currently trading at $2,728.36 after reaching a high of $2,789.50. This move marks a significant recovery from recent lows near $1,600 and confirms the formation of a strong uptrend. ETH has now reclaimed the 34-week EMA at $2,511.42 and is pushing above the 100-week SMA at $2,605.71. These moving averages now act as dynamic support levels, reinforcing bullish sentiment. The next critical level to watch is the 50-week SMA, currently sitting at $2,729.64, just slightly above the current price. A confirmed weekly close above this level would mark the first time ETH has sustained strength above it since late 2023. That could open the door for a push toward the $3,200–$3,600 zone, with $4,000 in sight if momentum accelerates. Volume has also picked up on this recent move, signaling healthy participation from buyers. Historically, similar recoveries from major moving average clusters have preceded expansive legs in Ethereum’s price. Related Reading: Ethereum Nears Critical Price Level – Reclaiming $3,000 Would Spark A Market-Wide Rally As long as ETH maintains this structure and closes the week above $2,700, bulls are likely to retain control.

2025-05-30T00:00:51.000Z,"Sui Community Launches Vote on Recovering $162,000,000 in Stolen Crypto From Hacker","The Sui ( SUI ) community appears poised to greenlight a recovery plan to return $162 million worth of crypto stolen from the decentralized exchange Cetus Protocol last week. Last week, a hacker hit Cetus with a sophisticated smart contract exploit targeting the decentralized exchange’s (DEX) concentrated liquidity market maker (CLMM) pools, purloining approximately $223 million worth of assets from the platform. The DEX quickly froze $162 million worth of the stolen assets. Now, the Sui community is currently voting on a proposal that enables a special transaction to return those frozen assets from two attacker addresses back to Cetus. If passed, the vote would approve a one-time authentication of two special transactions hard-coded with the two attacker addresses, stolen asset objects, and their destination. The votes are weighted by validator stake, but the Sui Foundation’s stake is excluded to maintain neutrality. The vote passes if more than 50% of the total stake participates and there are more “yes” votes than “no” votes. The voting period ends next week, but early passing could happen as early as Thursday if the remaining unvoted stake cannot change the outcome. That appears poised to happen, with 71% of the validators having already voted “yes” at time of writing, compared to 0.3% for “no,” 1.5% abstaining and 27.2% who had yet to vote. Cetus also announced this week that it is in a position to fully cover the remaining losses via cash, token treasuries and a loan from the Sui Foundation, pending the vote’s passage. “Because full recovery is dependent upon the results of the community vote, we humbly ask for the Sui community’s full support to recover the funds via the upcoming vote.

2025-05-30T00:00:48.000Z,"US Stock Market Soars Higher: What the Open Means for Crypto","BitcoinWorld US Stock Market Soars Higher: What the Open Means for Crypto Attention, crypto enthusiasts! While your focus might be on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the latest altcoin moves, paying attention to the broader financial landscape, especially the US stock market , is more crucial than ever. Today brought some notable news from Wall Street as markets opened with significant upward momentum. Let’s dive into what happened and why it matters for your digital asset portfolio. Positive Signals from the Stock Market Open The start of trading saw major indices pushing into positive territory, reflecting a notable shift in investor sentiment as the stock market open got underway. Here’s a quick look at the performance of the key benchmarks: S&P 500: Gained +0.79% NASDAQ Composite: Led the charge with a significant +1.43% increase Dow Jones Industrial Average: Posted a modest +0.14% gain This broad-based rise across different sectors indicates a potential increase in risk appetite among investors, a factor that often has ripple effects across various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Understanding the S&P 500’s Move The S&P 500 , often considered a bellwether for the overall health of the U.S. economy and stock market, showing a nearly 0.8% gain right out of the gate is a strong signal. This index represents the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States. Its positive movement suggests confidence in the earnings outlook and economic stability, at least for the short term. For crypto investors, a rising S&P 500 can sometimes correlate with positive sentiment spilling over into digital assets, especially those seen as growth investments. Why the NASDAQ’s Surge is Particularly Interesting for Crypto The NASDAQ , heavily weighted towards technology and growth stocks, posted the most significant percentage gain among the major indices today. This is particularly relevant for the crypto market because many crypto investors and projects are aligned with the technology sector. Historically, there has been a notable correlation between the performance of the NASDAQ and the price movements of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. A strong NASDAQ often suggests positive sentiment towards tech innovation and growth assets, which can directly benefit the crypto space. When tech stocks are rallying, it can create a favorable environment for digital assets that are also perceived as high-growth, disruptive technologies. The Dow Jones and Broader Market Health While the Dow Jones Industrial Average’s gain was more modest compared to the NASDAQ and S&P 500, its positive opening contributes to the overall narrative of a strong market start. The Dow tracks 30 large, publicly owned companies, often referred to as ‘blue-chip’ stocks. Its positive performance suggests that confidence isn’t limited just to the tech sector but is potentially spreading to broader industrial and financial areas of the economy. This widespread positivity can reinforce the overall bullish sentiment in the traditional markets, which, as mentioned, can influence the crypto market through various channels, including investor confidence and capital flows. What Does This Stock Market Open Mean for Crypto Investors? The correlation between traditional markets, especially tech stocks, and cryptocurrencies has become more pronounced over recent years. Here’s a breakdown of what today’s positive US stock market opening could imply for your crypto investments: Benefits: Positive Sentiment Spillover: A rising stock market can indicate increased investor confidence and risk appetite, potentially leading investors to allocate more capital into riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Macro Environment Indicator: Strong stock performance might reflect underlying positive economic factors (like favorable inflation data or optimistic growth forecasts) that could also support the crypto market. Validation of Growth Assets: The NASDAQ’s strong performance, in particular, can signal continued belief in growth-oriented and technology-driven assets, which aligns well with the narrative surrounding many cryptocurrencies. Challenges: Increased Correlation Risk: While correlation can be beneficial during market rallies, it also means crypto is more susceptible to downturns in traditional markets. If stocks fall, crypto might follow. Less Diversification: High correlation means holding both stocks and crypto might offer less diversification benefit than in the past. Actionable Insights for Your Portfolio Given the connection, how should a crypto investor react to this positive stock market open ? Monitor Key Economic Data: Keep an eye on the factors driving the stock market (inflation reports, jobs data, central bank commentary) as they increasingly influence crypto. Watch Tech Sector Performance: Pay close attention to the NASDAQ and major tech stocks, as their movements often foreshadow trends in the crypto market. Consider the Macro Landscape: Don’t view crypto in isolation. Understand its place within the broader financial ecosystem. Evaluate Your Risk Tolerance: Recognize that increased correlation means crypto’s volatility might be tied more closely to macro swings. Concluding Thoughts Today’s strong opening across the S&P 500 , NASDAQ , and Dow Jones is a significant event in the traditional finance world, and its implications for the cryptocurrency market are noteworthy. While crypto has its unique drivers, the increasing interconnectedness with global markets means that positive signals from Wall Street, particularly from the tech-heavy NASDAQ, can contribute to a favorable environment for digital assets. Staying informed about these traditional market movements is no longer optional but a vital part of navigating the complex and exciting world of cryptocurrency investing.

2025-05-29T23:55:54.000Z,"Crypto Market Cap Explodes Past $3.5T Driven by Institutional Demand","BitcoinWorld Crypto Market Cap Explodes Past $3.5T Driven by Institutional Demand Get ready for some significant news from the world of digital assets! The global crypto market cap has recently soared past an incredible milestone, exceeding $3.5 trillion. This isn’t just a number; it reflects a massive influx of capital and growing confidence in the digital asset space. What’s behind this surge? According to the on-chain analytics experts at Sentora (formerly known as IntoTheBlock), a major catalyst is the increasing institutional demand . What’s Fueling the Crypto Market Cap Surge? The headline figure of the crypto market cap crossing the $3.5 trillion threshold is certainly attention-grabbing. Sentora’s report highlights that while the entire ecosystem is contributing, the primary engine driving this recent growth is the significant interest and investment coming from large institutions. Bitcoin’s Role: A large part of this institutional focus is centered around Bitcoin . With the advent of regulated investment products like spot Bitcoin ETFs in various jurisdictions, traditional finance players now have easier, more familiar avenues to gain exposure to the leading cryptocurrency. Capital Influx: Institutions manage vast sums of capital. Even a small allocation from a large pension fund, hedge fund, or corporate treasury can represent hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars flowing into the market, disproportionately impacting the overall crypto market cap . Validation and Confidence: Institutional involvement often lends an air of legitimacy and maturity to an asset class. Their participation signals to other large players, and even sophisticated retail investors, that the market is becoming more established and less speculative than in its earlier days. Beyond Bitcoin: Strength in the Broader Ecosystem While Bitcoin might be leading the charge in terms of institutional flows, Sentora’s data reveals that the health of the crypto ecosystem extends far beyond just the king coin. The broader landscape is showing robust signs of recovery and growth, indicating increasing utility and adoption. DeFi’s Rebound: Decentralized Finance ( DeFi ) is seeing a significant resurgence. Sentora noted that DeFi loan books have rebounded to an impressive $30 billion. This metric is a key indicator of activity and confidence within decentralized lending, borrowing, and trading protocols. The recovery here suggests users are actively engaging with decentralized applications again after previous market downturns. Stablecoins’ Steadfast Growth: Stablecoins , digital currencies pegged to stable assets like the US dollar, have also seen remarkable growth. Sentora’s report points out a substantial 56% increase in their capitalization over the past year. This growth is crucial as stablecoins act as the primary medium of exchange within the crypto ecosystem, facilitating trading, lending, and payments without needing to constantly convert back to fiat currency. Their expanding market cap reflects increased activity and liquidity across the entire space. How is Regulation Shaping the Future? The evolving regulatory landscape in the United States is playing an increasingly important role in the crypto narrative, particularly concerning DeFi and stablecoins . Sentora highlighted that guidance and potential regulations from key bodies like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) are poised to significantly shape the future trajectory of these sectors. Clarity for Institutions: Regulatory clarity is often cited as a major hurdle for institutions considering deeper involvement in crypto. Clear rules around classification (is an asset a security or a commodity?), trading, and custody can provide the certainty large compliance departments require. Defining DeFi: Regulators are grappling with how to oversee decentralized protocols. Future guidance could impact how DeFi operates, potentially affecting everything from user interfaces to the underlying smart contracts. While some fear over-regulation, clear guidelines could also legitimize certain activities and attract more mainstream users and capital. Stablecoin Frameworks: Given their role in facilitating transactions and their potential to scale, stablecoins are under intense scrutiny. Proposed regulations aim to ensure their stability and prevent their use in illicit activities. A robust regulatory framework for stablecoins could pave the way for their wider adoption in payments and traditional finance. While regulatory developments can introduce uncertainty in the short term, many market participants view thoughtful regulation as a necessary step towards the long-term maturity and sustainability of the digital asset market. Benefits and Challenges of Increased Institutional Adoption The surge in institutional demand bringing the crypto market cap to new heights comes with both significant benefits and potential challenges: Benefits: Increased Liquidity: More institutional capital means deeper markets, making it easier to buy and sell assets without causing significant price swings. Reduced Volatility: Institutional trading strategies are often less emotional and short-term focused than retail, potentially leading to more stable market movements over time. Enhanced Legitimacy: Their participation validates crypto as a serious asset class, attracting further investment and talent. Infrastructure Development: Institutions require sophisticated tools and services, driving innovation in custody, trading platforms, and data analytics. Challenges: Centralization Concerns: Large pools of institutional capital could potentially lead to greater centralization of power and influence within certain protocols or assets. Market Manipulation Risks: While regulations aim to prevent this, large players could potentially exert undue influence on market prices. Regulatory Hurdles: The very regulations designed to attract institutions can also impose restrictions that impact the decentralized nature of some crypto projects, particularly in DeFi . Correlation with Traditional Markets: Increased institutional involvement could lead to crypto markets becoming more correlated with traditional finance, potentially reducing its diversification benefits. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Enthusiast What does this mean for you, the individual interested in or invested in crypto? The market reaching a $3.5 trillion crypto market cap driven by institutional demand is a strong signal of maturation. It suggests that digital assets are increasingly being viewed not just as speculative bets, but as legitimate components of global financial portfolios. Keep an eye on how regulatory discussions progress, as they will significantly impact the operational landscape for DeFi and stablecoins . Understanding the difference between assets primarily driven by retail vs. those attracting institutional interest (like Bitcoin ) can also be key to navigating market dynamics. Conclusion: A New Era for Digital Assets? Sentora’s latest data paints a clear picture: the crypto market is experiencing a period of significant growth, propelled by the increasing appetite from institutional investors, particularly for Bitcoin . This influx of sophisticated capital, coupled with the robust recovery seen in sectors like DeFi and the expanding utility of stablecoins , underscores the ecosystem’s resilience and evolving nature. As regulatory frameworks begin to solidify, they promise to further shape this burgeoning market. The journey to $3.5 trillion is a testament to the growing acceptance and integration of digital assets into the global financial fabric, potentially ushering in a new era for crypto.

2025-05-29T23:45:07.000Z,"Urgent: US GDP Contraction Signals Headwinds for Crypto Market","BitcoinWorld Urgent: US GDP Contraction Signals Headwinds for Crypto Market Attention crypto investors! While the headlines might seem focused purely on traditional finance, the latest economic data out of the United States holds significant clues for the future direction of the crypto market. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis recently released its second estimate for the first quarter of 2025, and the numbers caught many by surprise. Decoding the Latest US GDP Numbers So, what exactly did the data show? The report indicated that the US GDP , or Gross Domestic Product – the total value of goods and services produced in the country – contracted at an annual rate of 0.2% in Q1 2025. This figure was slightly less severe than the 0.3% decline that analysts had broadly expected, but it still represents a significant shift. Think of GDP as a report card for the US economy . A positive number means the economy is growing, while a negative number signals a slowdown or contraction. The previous quarter (Q4 2024) saw a healthy expansion of 2.4%. This sharp reversal into a GDP contraction in Q1 is therefore a notable event, suggesting the economic momentum seen late last year has faded. Here’s a quick look at the recent trend: Q4 2024 (Final Estimate): +2.4% Expansion Q1 2025 (Second Estimate): -0.2% Contraction This data point is crucial because it’s one of the primary indicators economists and policymakers use to gauge the health and direction of the economy. While this is the second of three estimates, the final number is usually close to the second, meaning this contraction is likely to stick. What Does This Economic Data Signal for the US Economy? A GDP contraction , even a modest one like 0.2%, immediately raises questions about the underlying strength of the US economy . While one quarter of negative growth doesn’t automatically mean a recession (which is typically defined by two consecutive quarters of contraction), it certainly puts recessionary fears back on the table for many analysts. What could be behind this slowdown? Several factors might contribute, including: Cooling Consumer Spending: Consumers are the engine of the US economy. If high inflation or borrowing costs are finally biting, they might be pulling back on spending. Reduced Business Investment: Uncertainty about the future economic outlook can lead companies to delay investments in new equipment, buildings, or hiring. Impact of Higher Interest Rates: The Federal Reserve’s past interest rate hikes are designed to slow the economy to combat inflation. This contraction suggests those policies are having their intended effect, perhaps more strongly now. Understanding this specific piece of economic data is key to forming a broader view of the macroeconomic landscape. Connecting the Dots: Economic Data and the Crypto Market Impact Now, let’s get to why this matters for you, the crypto enthusiast. Traditional economic data like the US GDP report can have a significant crypto market impact , albeit sometimes indirectly. Here’s how the dots connect: Investor Sentiment: A weakening US economy often leads to a shift in investor sentiment. When the economy looks shaky, investors tend to become more risk-averse. This can mean pulling money out of assets perceived as higher risk, which sometimes includes cryptocurrencies, and moving into safer havens like government bonds. Monetary Policy Expectations: A contracting economy puts pressure on the Federal Reserve. If the economy continues to slow, the Fed might feel compelled to lower interest rates sooner than previously anticipated to stimulate growth. Lower interest rates can make riskier assets, including crypto, relatively more attractive compared to low-yield traditional investments. Inflation Outlook: While the GDP report itself isn’t an inflation print, a slowing economy can potentially ease inflationary pressures as demand cools. A clearer path towards lower inflation could also influence the Fed’s actions and market sentiment, impacting crypto. Dollar Strength: Economic performance can affect the strength of the U.S. dollar. A weaker dollar can sometimes make dollar-denominated assets like Bitcoin more appealing to international investors. So, while Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks, their prices are still heavily influenced by global macroeconomic conditions and the liquidity available in the system, much of which is tied to the health of the US economy and the policies of its central bank. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Market After This US GDP Report Given this new piece of economic data , what should crypto investors consider? Stay Informed: Continue to monitor key economic data releases, not just US GDP . Inflation reports, jobs numbers, and Fed announcements are all critical pieces of the puzzle.

2025-05-29T23:30:16.000Z,"Ambitious Bitcoin Accumulation: Smarter Web Company Boosts Holdings in Bold 10-Year Plan","BitcoinWorld Ambitious Bitcoin Accumulation: Smarter Web Company Boosts Holdings in Bold 10-Year Plan In a move signaling strong conviction in the future of digital assets, UK-based web development firm The Smarter Web Company (SWC) recently announced a significant addition to its Bitcoin reserves. This purchase is not a one-off event but a deliberate step within their ambitious, decade-long strategy known as “The 10 Year Plan.” The company now proudly holds 83.24 BTC, reinforcing its position among businesses embracing Bitcoin accumulation as a core part of their financial strategy. Who is Smarter Web Company and What is Their Bold Plan? The Smarter Web Company, primarily known for its web development services, has publicly committed to a long-term Bitcoin investment strategy. Announcing their latest purchase via social media, SWC highlighted that this action is integral to their overarching digital asset roadmap. ‘The 10 Year Plan’ suggests a systematic approach to acquiring Bitcoin over an extended period, potentially employing strategies like dollar-cost averaging to mitigate volatility and build a substantial treasury position. This kind of public commitment from a company, even one outside the traditional financial sector, underscores a growing trend: businesses are increasingly looking at Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a legitimate component of their long-term financial health and strategy. SWC’s transparency about their holdings and plan is noteworthy in this evolving landscape. The Rising Trend of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings The concept of Corporate Bitcoin holdings gained significant traction following pioneering moves by companies like MicroStrategy. These early adopters paved the way, demonstrating that it’s feasible for publicly traded (and private) companies to allocate significant portions of their treasury reserves to Bitcoin. The motivations behind this trend are varied but often include: Inflation Hedge: Protecting corporate value against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Store of Value: Viewing Bitcoin as ‘digital gold,’ a scarce asset with potential for long-term appreciation. Balance Sheet Enhancement: Potential for significant returns on treasury assets that would otherwise yield minimal interest. Industry Leadership: Positioning the company at the forefront of digital asset adoption and innovation. While SWC’s holding of 83.24 BTC is modest compared to giants like MicroStrategy (which holds over 200,000 BTC), it represents a significant commitment for a company of its likely size. Every company adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet, regardless of scale, contributes to the broader narrative of institutional and corporate adoption. Decoding the Long-Term Bitcoin Plan What does a ’10 Year Plan’ for Bitcoin accumulation truly entail? Such a strategy typically implies a commitment to ride out the notorious volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Instead of trying to time the market highs and lows, a long-term approach often involves scheduled, regular purchases of Bitcoin. This Long-term Bitcoin plan can smooth out the average purchase price over time. Key aspects of a long-term accumulation plan like SWC’s might include: Defined Purchase Schedule: Buying a fixed amount of Bitcoin at regular intervals (e.g., weekly, monthly). Clear Allocation Percentage: Setting a target percentage of the company’s treasury or profits to be allocated to Bitcoin. Custody Solutions: Implementing secure methods for storing the accumulated Bitcoin (e.g., cold storage, reputable custodians). Accounting and Reporting: Establishing clear processes for accounting for Bitcoin holdings according to relevant standards. Communication: Being transparent with stakeholders (investors, employees) about the strategy and its rationale. This patient, strategic approach contrasts sharply with short-term trading and reflects a deep-seated belief in Bitcoin’s potential to increase in value significantly over the coming decade. Benefits and Challenges of Corporate Bitcoin Investment Strategy Adopting a Bitcoin investment strategy offers compelling potential benefits but also comes with notable challenges. Potential Benefits: Potential for Significant Growth: Bitcoin has historically outperformed many traditional assets over long periods. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset (at least historically) to the corporate treasury. Attracting Talent and Investors: Positioning the company as forward-thinking and innovative in the digital age. Inflation Protection: A hedge against the decreasing purchasing power of fiat currencies. Key Challenges: Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience dramatic swings, impacting the reported value of treasury holdings. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving in many jurisdictions. Security Risks: Protecting private keys from theft or loss requires robust security protocols. Accounting Complexity: Accounting for Bitcoin holdings can be complex under current rules (often treated as intangible assets subject to impairment). Public Perception: Some stakeholders may remain skeptical or critical of cryptocurrency investments. SWC’s commitment to a 10-year plan suggests they are prepared to navigate these challenges, focusing on the long-term potential rather than short-term fluctuations. Actionable Insights from SWC’s Move What can other businesses and even individual investors learn from Smarter Web Company’s decision to pursue Bitcoin accumulation over a decade? Think Long-Term: Short-term trading is risky. A long-term perspective aligns better with Bitcoin’s historical cycles and potential as a store of value. Strategy is Key: Don’t just buy Bitcoin impulsively. Develop a clear strategy (like SWC’s 10 Year Plan) outlining *why*, *how much*, and *how often* you plan to acquire. Understand the Risks: Be fully aware of the volatility, security requirements, and regulatory landscape. Start Small (if needed): You don’t need to allocate a massive amount initially. A consistent, smaller allocation over time can be effective. Secure Your Assets: Prioritize secure storage solutions from day one. SWC’s approach serves as a case study for how even non-financial companies are integrating digital assets into their core financial planning. Conclusion: A Decade of Digital Ambition The Smarter Web Company’s decision to increase its Corporate Bitcoin holdings to 83.24 BTC under the umbrella of ‘The 10 Year Plan’ is more than just a balance sheet update; it’s a statement of long-term vision. It highlights a growing confidence among diverse businesses in Bitcoin’s role as a future store of value and a hedge against economic uncertainty. While challenges exist, SWC’s commitment to a systematic, decade-long Long-term Bitcoin plan reflects a sophisticated understanding of the asset’s potential and the strategy required to harness it effectively. As more companies follow suit, the integration of digital assets into traditional finance and corporate strategy will only deepen, marking an exciting phase in the evolution of global economics.

2025-05-29T23:20:21.000Z,"Urgent: Bitcoin PoW Security Under Threat as Fees Plummet to 13-Year Low","BitcoinWorld Urgent: Bitcoin PoW Security Under Threat as Fees Plummet to 13-Year Low Hey crypto enthusiasts! Have you been keeping an eye on Bitcoin lately? While the price often grabs headlines, there’s a quiet but potentially significant development brewing beneath the surface: Bitcoin’s transaction fees have fallen to levels not seen in over a decade. This isn’t just about cheaper transactions; it’s sparking a serious debate about the long-term sustainability and security of the network’s core engine – its Proof-of-Work (PoW) model. Understanding Bitcoin PoW and Miner Revenue Before diving into the concerns, let’s quickly recap how Bitcoin PoW works. At its heart, Bitcoin relies on a decentralized network of miners who use massive amounts of computing power (hash rate) to solve complex mathematical problems. The first miner to solve the problem gets to add the next block of transactions to the blockchain and is rewarded in two ways: The Block Reward: A fixed amount of new BTC created with each block. This amount halves approximately every four years (the ‘halving’ event). Transaction Fees: Collected from users who include a small fee with their transactions to incentivize miners to prioritize and include them in blocks. This combination of block rewards and miner revenue is crucial. It pays for the electricity and hardware costs of mining, and more importantly, it incentivizes miners to secure the network by making it economically unfeasible for any single entity to gain control of the majority of the hash rate (a 51% attack). The Alarming Drop in Bitcoin Fees Recently, the contribution of Bitcoin fees to total miner revenue has plummeted. Data shows that transaction fees are now making up only about 1% of the total revenue earned by miners. To put this into perspective, this is the lowest percentage seen in 13 years, a period during which Bitcoin has undergone multiple halvings, significantly reducing the block reward. Why are fees so low right now? Several factors could be contributing: Reduced Network Congestion: Following periods of high activity (like the Ordinals craze), demand for block space has decreased. Increased Efficiency: Adoption of technologies like SegWit and batching transactions can make block space usage more efficient. Growth of Layer 2 Solutions: More transactions are potentially happening off the main chain on layers like the Lightning Network, reducing demand for base layer block space. While cheaper transactions might sound great for users, the dramatic drop in fees is raising eyebrows among researchers and experts concerned about the network’s long-term security guarantees. Is Bitcoin Security At Risk? The 51% Attack Concern This is where the core concern about Bitcoin security comes into play. The security of the PoW network is directly tied to the amount of hash rate dedicated to it. Miners provide this hash rate because they are incentivized by revenue. If the block reward continues to halve over time (eventually reaching zero) and transaction fees don’t rise significantly to compensate, the total miner revenue could become insufficient to support the massive amount of hash rate needed to make a 51% attack prohibitively expensive. An entity controlling more than 50% of the network’s total hash rate could potentially: Prevent new transactions from gaining confirmations. Reverse transactions they have sent while still retaining the funds (double-spending). Prevent other miners from finding blocks. Ethereum researcher Justin Drake recently highlighted this risk on X, estimating that a 51% attack on Bitcoin could potentially be executed with as little as $20 billion in hardware. While $20 billion is a huge sum, he contrasts this with Bitcoin’s potential future market capitalization, which some speculate could reach $200 trillion or more. In that context, a $20 billion attack cost looks like a mere fraction, raising serious questions about the proportionality of security cost to network value in the distant future. The Role of Miner Revenue Sustainability The sustainability of miner revenue is the linchpin. As the block reward diminishes with each halving, transaction fees are expected by many in the Bitcoin community to gradually become the dominant, and eventually the sole, source of miner income. The current situation, where fees are at a 13-year low despite recent halvings, challenges this long-held assumption. Some argue that the current low fee environment is temporary and that future adoption, increased usage, or new use cases (like Ordinals again) will naturally drive fees higher over time. They point to historical periods where fees spiked significantly during times of high network congestion. However, others are less optimistic, suggesting that without a structural change, the long-term decline in the block reward coupled with potentially insufficient fee growth could lead to a gradual decrease in hash rate, making the network less secure over decades. Potential Structural Reforms and Debates The discussion around low fees inevitably leads to debates about potential structural changes to Bitcoin, though these are highly controversial within the community: Increasing Fee Growth: The most organic solution, relying on increased demand for block space. Can Bitcoin’s base layer transaction volume grow enough to support security? Introducing Tail Issuance: This would mean changing Bitcoin’s hard cap of 21 million coins and introducing a small, perpetual block reward after all 21 million BTC are mined. This is seen as heresy by many Bitcoin maximalists who view the fixed supply as a core, unchangeable feature. Transitioning to Proof-of-Stake (PoS): Moving away from energy-intensive mining to a system where security relies on validators staking their coins, similar to Ethereum 2.0. This is arguably even more controversial than tail issuance, as it would fundamentally alter Bitcoin’s security model and distribution mechanism, which are considered sacrosanct by many. Currently, there is no significant movement or consensus within the core Bitcoin development community to implement radical changes like tail issuance or PoS. The prevailing belief is that the fee market will eventually mature and provide sufficient security. Broader Implications for the Crypto Ecosystem Why should the broader crypto ecosystem care about Bitcoin security ? As the largest and most established cryptocurrency, Bitcoin’s stability and security are foundational to the entire market. A successful 51% attack on Bitcoin, however unlikely it may seem today, would send shockwaves through every corner of the crypto world, severely damaging confidence and potentially leading to widespread panic and regulatory backlash. Experts warn that systemic risks to Bitcoin could have cascading effects, impacting altcoins, stablecoins, decentralized finance (DeFi), and institutional adoption. Therefore, the health and security of the Bitcoin network are of paramount importance to everyone involved in the crypto space. What Does This Mean for You? As an investor or enthusiast, understanding this debate is crucial. It highlights that even established technologies like Bitcoin face long-term challenges that require ongoing discussion and potential future solutions. While a 51% attack isn’t an imminent threat given the current hash rate and attack cost, the trend of declining fee contribution relative to the block reward is a data point worth monitoring. Keep an eye on: Transaction Fee Trends: Are fees recovering or continuing to lag? Hash Rate Levels: Is the network’s total computing power remaining high? Community Discussions: Are debates around fee mechanisms, tail issuance, or other potential changes gaining traction? Technological Developments: How are Layer 2 solutions and other scaling technologies impacting base layer fee pressure? Compelling Summary Bitcoin’s transaction fees hitting a 13-year low is more than just a statistic; it’s a signal prompting critical examination of the network’s long-term security model. While the Bitcoin PoW mechanism has proven incredibly robust, its reliance on ever-decreasing block rewards means that future security will increasingly depend on sufficient miner revenue from transaction fees. The current low fee environment, contributing just 1% to miner income, raises valid questions about whether the fee market alone can sustainably secure the network against potential 51% attack vectors in the distant future, especially as the network’s value potentially grows exponentially. While radical changes like tail issuance or PoS remain highly controversial and unlikely in the short term, the ongoing debate underscores the dynamic nature of blockchain technology and the importance of ensuring robust Bitcoin security for the health of the entire crypto ecosystem. It’s a challenge the community must continue to address as Bitcoin evolves. To learn more about the latest Bitcoin trends, explore our article on key developments shaping Bitcoin price action.

2025-05-29T23:17:15.000Z,"SEC warns cryptocurrency users not to expect bailouts from the commission","SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, fondly called crypto mom, stated that the SEC withdrawing from over-enforcement does not mean it will not move in cases of clear violations in the crypto space. Under new leadership, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has decided to drop several crypto-related lawsuits and probes. However, that doesn’t mean the agency will stop going after fraudsters, one of the agency’s top chiefs said on Thursday. The SEC plans to use its power properly this time The SEC under Gary Gensler became famous for dogging crypto with excessive regulation that stifled innovation, but things have changed. The change brought new leadership and apparently a new mandate that allowed the securities watchdog to drop several high-profile cases against firms like Coinbase, Uniswap, and OpenSea. Still, while speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Commissioner Hester Peirce told the crowd that the SEC’s new behavior does not mean people can now do whatever they want. Peirce implied that the combative side of the SEC will now be reserved for people who violate the clear existing rules. “It’s certainly not to say that there will not be enforcement. There’s a lot of bad activity, as we all know, that’s perpetrated in the name of crypto,” Peirce, who is a critic of the SEC’s previous tactic of “regulation through enforcement,” also said . In that regard, she agrees with Gensler in that crypto was “rife with fraud and manipulation.” He also said that many cryptocurrencies would be securities, but Peirce has a contrasting stance, saying that most crypto assets are probably not themselves securities on Thursday. As a result, Peirce believes trading platforms handling them shouldn’t need to register with the SEC unless they’re also touching the securities world. Commissioner Hester Peirce wants accountability from crypto users Peirce, nicknamed “crypto mom” because of her openness to the industry, also discussed investor loss and the SEC’s role on Thursday at the conference, calling for consistency, specifically among more libertarian folks in crypto. “I do think that sometimes, when something bad happens in this space, people who are remarkably free thinkers, libertarian-minded people, come in and say, ‘Where was the government? Why weren’t you protecting me? Hey, Crypto Mom, where’s my bailout?'” she mused at the conference. Peirce called for consistency. “Yes, you should have freedom to make your own choices,” she said. “And when it goes wrong, pick yourself up, dust yourself off, learn from it and do better next time. And that is the best way to move forward.” Now that the SEC is led by Trump appointees, it has been busy issuing statements and directives to carve out corners of the crypto sector from the agency’s jurisdiction, including memecoins, some crypto mining and certain stablecoins. Despite all the progress they have made, there is still much policy-making to come in the future, and lawmakers are also working on sweeping new laws that could further their agenda. The SEC has a lot of current authority to clarify the nature of crypto securities, Peirce said. But if people want a U.S. federal regulator for retail trading, they’ll need Congress to produce legislation to make that happen. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-05-29T23:15:26.000Z,"Bitcoin ETF Inflows Signal Unstoppable Investor Rotation Away From Gold","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin ETF Inflows Signal Unstoppable Investor Rotation Away From Gold Are you watching the financial markets closely? Something significant is happening, and it involves a major Investor Rotation . Recent data highlights a compelling trend: investors are increasingly shifting capital from traditional safe havens like gold into the burgeoning world of digital assets, particularly Bitcoin. This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it’s a noticeable pivot with potentially long-term implications for asset allocation strategies within the broader Crypto Market . The Great Rotation: Bitcoin ETF vs. Gold ETF Flows The most striking evidence of this shift comes from exchange-traded fund (ETF) flows. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF products have experienced an impressive surge in inflows over the past few weeks, attracting billions in fresh capital. This stands in stark contrast to the performance of Gold ETF products, which have seen significant outflows during the same period. Let’s look at the numbers reported by Bloomberg: Bitcoin ETFs: Over $9 billion in inflows in approximately five weeks. Gold ETFs: Approximately $2.8 billion in outflows during the same timeframe. This divergence in flows suggests a clear change in investor sentiment and preference. While gold has historically been the go-to asset during times of economic uncertainty, Bitcoin appears to be increasingly filling that role for a segment of the investment community. Why the Shift? Understanding the Drivers Behind Investor Rotation Several factors are contributing to this noticeable Investor Rotation . Analysts point to a mix of macroeconomic concerns and the evolving perception of Bitcoin itself. Key drivers include: Concerns over U.S. Fiscal Stability: Rising government debt and ongoing fiscal stimulus measures are prompting some investors to seek assets outside the traditional financial system. Both gold and Bitcoin are seen as potential hedges against inflation and currency devaluation, but Bitcoin’s fixed supply offers a unique appeal. Bitcoin’s Growing Role as a Hedge: While historically volatile, Bitcoin’s low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds makes it attractive as a portfolio diversifier. As confidence in traditional hedges wavers, Bitcoin’s digital scarcity and decentralized nature are gaining attention. Accessibility via ETFs: The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETF products in the U.S. has significantly lowered the barrier to entry for institutional and retail investors who were previously hesitant to hold Bitcoin directly. This ease of access is undoubtedly fueling the recent surge in inflows. Bitcoin: The Digital Store of Value? For decades, gold has reigned supreme as the ultimate Store of Value , a tangible asset believed to retain its worth over long periods, especially during economic turmoil. However, the digital age is challenging this notion, with Bitcoin emerging as a credible alternative. Here’s a quick comparison: Feature Gold Bitcoin Scarcity Finite supply, but unknown total quantity; difficult to verify Absolutely finite supply (21 million); verifiable on blockchain Portability Heavy, difficult/expensive to transport large amounts Easily transferable globally with minimal cost Divisibility Difficult to divide into small units without loss Highly divisible (down to 8 decimal places) Verifiability Requires expertise/equipment to assay purity Easily verifiable via the public ledger Storage Requires secure physical storage (vaults, safes) Stored digitally (wallets); secure with private keys While gold still holds significant appeal and a long history, Bitcoin’s digital properties make it potentially superior in terms of portability, divisibility, and verifiability in the modern era. The increasing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, partly facilitated by the success of the Bitcoin ETF , is solidifying its position as a potential digital Store of Value . What This Means for the Crypto Market The strong performance of Bitcoin ETF inflows and the corresponding outflows from Gold ETF s signal growing institutional and retail confidence in Bitcoin. This trend could have several implications for the broader Crypto Market : Increased Legitimacy: The influx of traditional investment capital through ETFs lends significant legitimacy to Bitcoin and the wider crypto space. Potential for Further Adoption: As more investors become comfortable with Bitcoin via regulated products, it could pave the way for interest in other digital assets. Market Dynamics: Large capital flows can influence market prices and volatility. Understanding these flows is crucial for anyone participating in the Crypto Market . Despite gold’s historically stronger year-to-date performance leading up to this period of rotation, the momentum behind Bitcoin, driven by its low correlation with traditional assets and its appeal amid financial system risks, is undeniable. The ease of access provided by the Bitcoin ETF has clearly played a pivotal role in accelerating this trend, allowing more investors to participate in Bitcoin’s journey to becoming a recognized Store of Value . Conclusion: A New Era for Asset Allocation? The recent surge in Bitcoin ETF inflows coinciding with outflows from Gold ETF s marks a potentially significant moment in the evolution of investment strategies. While gold retains its historical importance, Bitcoin is rapidly gaining traction as a digital alternative, driven by macroeconomic factors and its unique properties as a potential Store of Value . This Investor Rotation highlights the increasing acceptance of Bitcoin within traditional finance and signals a potential shift in how investors think about hedging risk and preserving wealth in the 21st century Crypto Market .

2025-05-29T23:00:33.000Z,"Input Output Exits Cardano Leadership Ahead Of Elections","Cardano development studio Input Output Global (IOG) has announced that it will relinquish its seat on the blockchain’s Interim Constitutional Committee once community elections conclude this summer, drawing a clear line under the role it assumed during the 2024 Chang hard-fork transition. In a three-part X thread published on May 28, the company wrote that it was “honored to serve on Cardano’s Interim Constitutional Committee ” but “will not stand for reelection,” adding that it is “confident the Cardano community has a wealth of talent to choose from.” IOG reminded followers that it “stepped up in August 2024, at the time of the Chang hard fork , to help steward the process during a time of transition,” and pledged to keep casting on-chain votes and publishing rationales until its mandate expires. The firm urged prospective candidates to consult resources assembled by Intersect, the member-based organization coordinating governance matters, and to “draw on the support offered by Intersect and existing ICC members to facilitate the election.” Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson echoed the sentiment in a separate post, writing: “Our last official role soon ends. It’s been an honor and the privilege of my career to serve with you all. Time for new ideas and blood.” Cardano Elections The ICC was formed alongside the first phase of the Chang upgrade in late August 2024, a hard fork that introduced the foundations of on-chain governance to Cardano’s Conway-era ledger. The upgrade empowered ADA holders to elect delegates (dReps) and submit governance actions—features that required an oversight body while the full Constitutional Committee framework was being finalized. Intersect’s election roadmap sets out five phases that run through the northern summer. Candidate registrations opened on May 1 and close on May 31; campaigning occurs in parallel. Token-weighted voting will then run from June 10 to July 10, followed by onboarding and credential generation for the seven successful candidates from July 10 to August 1. Formal ratification—including an on-chain governance action to recognize the new committee—is scheduled between August 1 and September 1. The three highest-vote recipients will serve two-year terms, while the remaining four will sit for one year to create a staggered election cycle. What Changes—And What Does Not IOG’s withdrawal does not diminish its technical role in Cardano’s open-source development, but it signals a decisive shift in governance: founding entities will henceforth compete on equal terms with community candidates if they wish to help police the Constitution. For many long-time stakeholders, that shift fulfills the Voltaire-era promise of “governance by the holders,” a milestone repeatedly described by Hoskinson as the final piece of Cardano’s original roadmap .

2025-05-29T22:20:46.000Z,"Ethereum researcher raise concerns about Bitcoin potential security problem due to its low fees","Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake has warned about the security of the Bitcoin Network. Drake shared his view on X, noting that the Bitcoin Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism is a ticking time bomb. The blockchain security expert, one of the masterminds behind the Merge, i.e., Ethereum transition from PoW to Proof of Stake (PoS), identified Bitcoin’s low fees as the major risk to its security. According to Drake , Bitcoin fees have fallen for 13 years, with miners generating less than 10 BTC in daily fees. He believes that this low fee represents a disincentive for most miners who are the ones securing the network and could eventually affect the network, a contagion risk for the whole crypto industry. He said: “Bitcoin’s security model is broken. If Bitcoin gets taken over, the fallout could take the entire crypto ecosystem. The systemic risks can’t be ignored.” The researcher noted that Bitcoin fees have constantly declined for over a decade despite halving and reducing the issuance rate. In fact, the fees are falling faster than the issuance rate on the network, with a 30-day moving average (MA) of Bitcoin transaction fees currently at 6.5 BTC per day. Bitcoin Transaction Fees.(Source: X/Drake) This meant that fees only account for around 1% of miners’ revenue over the years, and Bitcoin miners could see a 100% decline in their revenue once the complete 21 million BTC have been mined. However, Category Labs researcher Kushal Babel disagreed with the argument, noting that denominating fees in BTC to say it is at an all-time low is wrong. According to him, the whole argument might change if BTC fees are denominated in US Dollars. Babel argued that Drake’s opinion that the ratio of BTC market cap to the amount securing it makes the network vulnerable to a 51% attack is a weak argument at best, and the focus should be on the cost of an attack in dollars. Higher prices may not save the Bitcoin network from attack Meanwhile, Drake added that a rise in Bitcoin prices could be inimical to network security because it would make it harder to sustain the BTC-denominated fees. In order to explain this, he described a scenario where Bitcoin price increases but fees stay unchanged, noting that fees at the time will only cover around 10% of the security cost for the network. He said: “Let’s be optimistic and say BTC rises to $1M, and today’s 6.5 BTC/day in fees is maintained: $6.5M/day in fees, 10% of today’s security budget. Bitcoin would be a $20T asset secured by 1/10th of today’s hashing infrastructure.” Thus, he believes that the cost of attacking the Bitcoin network will not increase even as the price of BTC increases. This could make it possible for a 51% attack on the Bitcoin network to cost as little as $20 billion, even if the network has a market cap of $200 trillion tokens. Drake further debunked the presumption that Bitcoin fees will increase, noting that this has not happened in the last 13 years. He added that all previous attempts to boost Bitcoin fees by increasing its utility as a transaction layer have failed to achieve sustainable long-term gains, with projects such as Ordinals, Liquid, Omni, Babylon, and others only creating short-term spikes. Potential solutions to Bitcoin’s fragile security With Drake highlighting Bitcoin’s risks, he proposed two solutions that could work for the network if fees do not increase. According to him, the solution is for Bitcoin to expand the total supply beyond the 21 million cap or for the network to switch to Proof of Stake. Unsurprisingly, he acknowledged that these two proposed solutions are unlikely to be implemented, given that they are completely against the conventional ethos of the Bitcoin community. However, he insisted that creating a Bitcoin Virtual Machine or Proof of Authority, where the major mining pools will secure the network, is unlikely to work. Still, he called on anyone who could explain how the PoA will function to do so. Interestingly, other users have proposed more potential solutions. Ethereum Foundation researcher Ansgar Dieetrichs recommended that Bitcoin developers end congestion pricing and increase the fee floor with the hope that the revenue is enough. He noted that this is likely the best solution for the network, but added other options, such as Bitcoin becoming a Layer-2 on a secure PoS chain or becoming an ERC-20 token. Other solutions include mining at a loss or allowing centralized custodians and large BTC holders to donate to on-chain security. Unsurprisingly, not everyone welcomed the opinion, especially among Bitcoin supporters. Bitcoin maxi Udi Wizardheimer criticized the opinion, noting that Drake is concerned about a security problem that Ethereum might have in 100 years, when Ethereum is struggling presently.

2025-05-29T22:18:41.000Z,"Suspects in Manhattan Crypto Kidnapping, Torture Case Plead Not Guilty as Investigation Widens","Two men suspected in the kidnapping and torture of a 28-year-old Italian cryptocurrency investor have pleaded not guilty, while the investigation into their case appears to have expanded to the New York Police Department itself. New York police had previously arrested William Duplessie , 33, and John Woeltz , 37, on the charges, as well as a third individual, Beatrice Folchi, 24, though her prosecution is being deferred. The victim has not been publicly named. The men are accused of kidnapping the victim and holding him hostage in a luxury townhouse in Manhattan’s ritzy SoHo neighborhood for more than two weeks. During that time, New York City police say the trio tortured the man, forcing him to take drugs, dangling him from a ledge, urinating on him and electrocuting him in an effort to force him to hand over the private keys to his bitcoin. The alleged perpetrators are accused of making t-shirts of the victim with a crack pipe in his mouth and taking Polaroids of the victim with a gun to his head. The victim escaped last Friday, grabbing his laptop and getting out of the townhouse and then seeking help from a traffic officer. Duplessie entered a not-guilty plea to five different charges, including kidnapping with an intent to collect a ransom, kidnapping and causing a physical injury, criminal possession of a loaded firearm, assault with an intent to cause a physical injury with a weapon and unlawful imprisonment, according to the court docket. Woeltz was charged with kidnapping, assault, unlawful imprisonment and criminal possession of a firearm, and he also pleaded not guilty, according to his court docket. Two NYPD officers, including a detective assigned to Mayor Eric Adams' protection detail, worked for both Duplessie and Woeltz in their off-duty hours and have now been placed on modified duty, Bloomberg reported Thursday. A source familiar told CoinDesk that the two officers are not believed to be part of the kidnapping, but rather did security work for the defendants. They may have driven the victim from an airport to the townhouse, but have not been tied to his torture, the source said. A spokesperson for the NYPD said the matter was \""under internal review.\"" A spokesperson for the mayor's office said in a statement that, \""Every city employee is expected to follow the law, including our officers, both on and off duty. We are disturbed by these allegations, and as soon as it came to our attention, the officers were placed on modified duty.

2025-05-29T22:01:42.000Z,"Iranian International Behind Robbinhood Ransomware Scheme Pleads Guilty – U.S. Department of Justice","An Iranian man is pleading guilty to being the mastermind behind the Robbinhood ransomware scam. According to a recent press release by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), 37-year-old Sina Gholinejad of Iran has pleaded guilty to participating in a hack of multiple cities across the US, causing widespread disruption and tens of millions of dollars in losses. Authorities say that in January 2019, Gholinejad and his co-conspirators gained and maintained illegal access to the victims’ computers, stealing sensitive data and uploading the Robbinhood malware, which in turn would take over a victim’s PC, encrypt its files, and attempt to extort crypto assets out of them in exchange for the release of the data. Gholinejad and his team would then attempt to launder the stolen funds through crypto mixing services and chain-hopping and hide their identities using advanced methods. As stated by Matthew R. Galeotti, Head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, in the press release, “The ransomware attack against the City of Baltimore forced the city to take hundreds of computers offline and prevented the city from performing basic functions for months. Gholinejad’s conviction reflects the Criminal Division’s commitment to bringing cybercriminals who target our cities, healthcare system, and businesses to justice no matter where they are located. There will be no impunity for these destructive attacks.” Other cities affected included Greenville, North Carolina, as well as Yonkers, New York, and Gresham, Oregon. Gholinejad is scheduled to be sentenced in August and could face a maximum penalty of up to 30 years behind bars.

2025-05-29T22:00:54.000Z,"SEC Files to Dismiss Long-Running Lawsuit Against Binance","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission moved to drop its long-running lawsuit against crypto exchange Binance on Thursday, without providing an explanation in a court filing. The SEC and Binance filed a joint motion, noting that the case had already been paused while the SEC's new crypto task force worked to \""develop a regulatory framework for crypto assets.\"" \""In the exercise of its discretion and as a policy matter, the Commission believes the dismissal of this Litigation is appropriate,\"" the joint filing said . \""... the Commission's decision to seek dismissal of this Litigation does not necessarily reflect the Commission's position in any other litigation or proceeding.\"" The SEC has not published a framework yet, though lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives introduced their formal bill to define how the SEC and its sister agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, would each oversee digital assets earlier on Thursday. The parties want the case dismissed with prejudice, meaning the SEC would not be able to bring this lawsuit against Binance again in the future. The filing also includes provisions to block Binance or its affiliated entities and executives from filing a suit or complaint against the SEC tied to the lawsuit, which was brought in June 2023 against Binance, Binance.US and Binance founder Changpeng CZ Zhao. Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who's overseeing the case, previously ruled that the SEC had brought plausible charges against the exchange and allowed most the lawsuit to proceed last year. In a statement, an external spokesperson for Binance.US said they were \""pleased that the SEC fully dismissed its charges against Binance.US, confirming what we have always known — that the company did not violate U.S. securities laws.\"" \""Today’s news is a major milestone for our company, as putting this matter to rest allows us to focus entirely on growing our business and work on restoring our relationships that were impacted by the SEC,\"" the statement said. \""We are excited about the future of Binance.US and crypto in the U.S. and look forward to continuing to offer access to crypto in the U.S., while maintaining our commitment to compliance and our customers.\"" Thursday's filing just marks the latest withdrawal for the SEC, which already moved to drop over a dozen other investigations and lawsuits . Prior to 2025, the SEC was investigating non-fungible token marketplaces and suing crypto exchanges. Binance was just one exchange the SEC alleged was illegally operating as an unregistered broker, clearinghouse and exchange. Others included Coinbase and Kraken. The SEC's about-turn came after Donald Trump retook office as the U.S. President, appointing Commissioner Mark Uyeda as acting chair and nominating Paul Atkins to be the agency's full chair. Atkins was confirmed and sworn into office last month. Last week, Binance announced it would list USD1, a stablecoin issued by World Liberty Financial, a crypto company tied to Trump, some of Trump's children and some of his affiliates. Earlier Thursday, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce said during an appearance at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas that some crypto investors should not expect a bailout or government protection if they invest in speculative digital assets.

2025-05-29T22:00:37.000Z,"Bitcoin Primed To Implode To $200,000 In 2025 As ‘Obvious’ Bullish Breakout Indicator Emerges, Pundit Predicts","Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies posted significant losses on May 29 as markets continued to price out interest rate cuts — a key tailwind for crypto. Data from CoinGecko shows BTC dipping below $106,000 to challenge multiday lows. Still, one pundit remains confident that the benchmark crypto is prepping for its next major leg up as a highly reliable signal materializes for the first time since mid-2024. Bitcoin To $200,000 In 2025 Popular crypto analyst Stockmoney Lizards took to X to tell his 158,700 followers that Bitcoin is primed to repeat its bull run to a cycle top like in 2016 and 2020. The monthly Optimized Trend Tracker (OTT) tool, which provides price trend insights by leveraging averages and average true range data, is set for Bitcoin’s next parabolic rally to fresh all-time high. “The pattern is so obvious it hurts,” the X post claimed, calling OTT the “cleanest trend indicator you can use for macro moves.” In 2014-2016, the Bitcoin price retested the cluster of OTT trend lines, then rocketed to $20K historic highs after solidifying them as support. The same pattern was witnessed in 2018-2020. And now, two retests have already transpired, suggesting a major upside move is imminent for Bitcoin. “We just broke out of the monthly OTT bands. Again,” the analyst observed. According to Stockmoney Lizards, OTT bands show you when assets are ready for their next major rally, noting that “we’re there.” As for the price target, the analyst envisions Bitcoin hitting $200,000 by the end of 2025, with a potential “extension” to $250,000 next year. Smart Money Agrees On Bitcoin’s Year-End Target Several analysts have set $200,000 as their target for the world’s largest digital asset this year. Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets at British multinational bank Standard Chartered, has been one of the leading voices. As ZyCrypto reported previously, Kendrick predicted that Bitcoin will reach $120,000 in the second quarter of 2025 en route to $200,000 by year-end , fueled by strategic asset reallocation away from US assets, regulatory headwinds, and aggressive accumulation by whales. Even Ripple boss Bradley Garlinghouse believes that Bitcoin shattering the $200K milestone “is not unreasonable” amid shifting regulatory winds in the United States. Meanwhile, BitMEX co-founder and former CEO, Arthur Hayes, said Bitcoin could soar to $250,000 in 2025 if the United States Federal Reserve resumes quantitative easing (QE).",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-primed-to-implode-to-200000-in-2025-as-obvious-bullish-breakout-indicator-emerges-pundit-predicts/,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare
2025-05-29T22:00:21.000Z,"Banco Santander To Stablecoin and Retail Crypto Services","Banco Santander SA is looking to expand into digital assets. According to a Bloomberg report citing sources familiar with the matter, the bank plans to introduce a stablecoin and provide cryptocurrency services to retail clients through its digital banking platform. The report reveals that these plans are still in the early stages. Banco Santander Leaps Into Stable Token Issuance Undoubtedly, this move is part of Santander’s larger goal to include digital assets in its services. This move also comes with the growing stablecoin market, and altcoins are seeing widespread adoption from key industry players. Recall that in November 2023, Santander Private Banking International started allowing clients with Swiss accounts to trade Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). The bank uses a regulated custody model to ensure the security of these assets. As reported by TheCoinRise, this specialized trading option is subject to predefined criteria, providing a strategic and discerning approach to cryptocurrency involvement. The bank could become an important player in the evolving digital finance ecosystem by developing a stablecoin and expanding its retail crypto offerings. BBVA Set to Launch Stablecoin on Ethereum Blockchain In 2024, BBVA, a Spanish multinational banking giant and Santander’s rival, said it plans to launch its stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain . Notably, this project is powered by Visa’s new tokenization platform, VTAP. This move could also make BBVA the first global bank to issue a stablecoin on the network. Meanwhile, BBVA’s stablecoin initiative on the Ethereum blockchain is not just a technical experiment. It is a bold testament to the future of banking. The pilot, expected to go live in 2025, will begin with a selected group of customers. The project aims for BBVA to mint, transfer, and redeem stablecoins while leveraging Visa’s VTAP. Above all, it is geared towards offering a seamless experience for its customers. Currently, BBVA is testing its stablecoin core functionalities within the VTAP sandbox. These tests involve issuing, transferring, and redeeming stablecoins on a testnet of the Ethereum blockchain. Stablecoin Demand Still Booming Major financial institutions’ drive to explore a stablecoin project reflects rising interest in the sector . According to recent market data, the total stablecoin market capitalization surged over 30% in 2025 alone, from $205 billion to $251 billion. Austin Campbell, a professor at NYU and founder of Zero Knowledge Consulting, remarked that traditional banks may be “panicking” as stablecoins begin to challenge core banking models. Big Tech is also getting involved. Meta has reportedly begun exploring how to integrate stablecoin payments across its platforms. Intriguingly, this underlines the growing relevance of blockchain-based assets in everyday financial infrastructure.

Per Cryptopolitan’s calculations, the bitcoin stash is worth over $10 billion at current prices, and the gold bars make up another huge slice of reserves. On the same presentation slide, Paolo showed that Tether earned a $13 billion profit in 2024, making it the most profitable name in crypto by a long shot. Paolo explains Tether’s gold decision at the Bitcoin event The crowd at Bitcoin 2025 wasn’t full of gold lovers, but Paolo didn’t dodge that. He responded directly to the tension. “Many bitcoiners don’t like talking about gold as if gold would take away something from Bitcoin. There is no way. Bitcoin is perfect. Gold is imperfect,” Paolo said . He added, “Gold is not competing with bitcoin; gold is competing with fiat and that’s why we like a little bit of gold.” “We invested 2 billion in energy production and bitcoin mining actually is a bit more than that. Something that we have been very shy to say, but I think that it’s very realistic that by the end of the year, Tether will be the biggest Bitcoin miner in the world, even including all the public companies.” Tether’s most recent financial disclosure for Q1 2025 laid out its current reserves. The report confirmed that Tether is holding over $7 billion in bitcoin and more than $6 billion in standard physical gold bars. That bitcoin valuation was based on a BTC price of around $83,000 at the time of the report. And that’s not the only tie-in. Earlier Thursday, Tether backer Cantor Fitzgerald Asset Management announced a new product: a fund that will offer direct exposure to bitcoin with “1-to-1 downside protection based on the price of gold.” While all that was happening, Tether-backed company Twenty One Capital was updating its financial filing. The company raised another $100 million by selling convertible notes, bringing its total raise to $685 million. Twenty One is led by Jack Mallers, founder of Strike, and is forming through a SPAC merger with Cantor Equity Partners, which is already listed on Nasdaq. Before this new round, Twenty One had already locked down $585 million, with $385 million from earlier convertible notes and $200 million through a PIPE deal. This latest funding will go straight into buying more bitcoin. The company already spent $458 million on BTC earlier this month, and another $3.6 billion came in as part of the merger.

2025-05-29T21:10:36.000Z,"U.S. House Republicans Officially Introduce Crypto Market Structure Bill","Leading Republicans in the House of Representatives have formally introduced their latest version of the bill to establish a regulatory structure for digital assets markets, something the industry has clamored for for years. The successor to the previous session's Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), the new bill called the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act is being pushed by top Republicans in the House Financial Services and the House Agriculture committees. Stablecoin legislation is still the frontrunner to be the first major piece of U.S. crypto law, but Thursday's introduction pushes the ball forward on the more important and complex of the two companion efforts. \""America should be the global leader in the digital assets marketplace, but we can’t do that without establishing a clear regulatory framework,\"" said Representative Dusty Johnson, the South Dakota Republican who leads the agriculture subcommittee focused on digital assets, in a statement on the bill's introduction. The hefty 236-page Clarity Act — likely a starting point for lengthy negotiations between the parties in the House and eventually their Senate counterparts — gives the Commodity Futures Trading Commission \""exclusive regulatory jurisdiction over digital commodity cash or spot markets that occur on or with new CFTC registered entities,\"" which represents the bulk of crypto activity according to the current thinking of U.S. regulators. The legislation would set up a regime in which crypto platforms would have options for registration with the CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission, depending on whether they're trading in digital assets commodities such as bitcoin BTC, securities or both. Those seeking registration with the CFTC as a digital commodity exchange, broker or dealer could get provisional registrations while the agency is working on rules. The bill also requires crypto platforms to be regulated as financial firms under the Bank Secrecy Act; exempts certain decentralized finance (DeFi) operations and wallet providers from SEC oversight; bans future efforts of regulators to force custody firms to hold their customers' assets on their own balance sheets as the SEC staff sought to do under a now-scrapped accounting stance; and puts some transactional authorities over payment stablecoins — which are clearly stated to not be securities — in the hands of whichever regulator already oversees the firm involved in the activity. The Clarity Act additionally delved into so-called \""qualified digital asset custodians\"" — previously a controversial point when the SEC sought to allow only a narrow array of regulated custodians to handle the assets of investment advisers' clients. The new bill sets the standard for such a custodian as one under \""adequate supervision and appropriate regulation by certain federal, state, or foreign authorities\"" — a bar the CFTC will be called to define. DeFi is kicked down the road, with the bill demanding the SEC, CFTC and Treasury Department study that arena of digital assets and come back with a report in a year on how to proceed. The Government Accountability Office would also be asked to write a report on DeFi and on non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The involved regulators would have a year to put the Clarity Act's market structure rules into effect if the law were enacted. That's a tight timeframe for complex financial regulation, which can often take more than a year — or even several years — for the agency staffs to write rules and seek public input. Despite similar timelines in the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, for instance, there are still a few provisions that haven't yet been completed. The Senate will return to a floor debate next week on its stablecoin bill, which has already cleared several procedural hurdles with bipartisan support, despite loud Democratic misgivings about President Donald Trump's personal business connections to the crypto sector his government is seeking to regulate. But it's unclear whether that legislation will mesh with whatever version of stablecoin oversight the House eventually votes on, leaving uncertainty about exactly how crypto legislation will proceed in this session. Some discussion remains about whether the stablecoin and market structure bills should be combined as a single crypto push in Congress. Trump has called for both to land on his desk by the August congressional break, though many crypto insiders in Washington see that as a highly ambitious goal. The relevant House committees are set to hold digital assets hearings next week that will give members a chance to publicly discuss the details of the legislation.

2025-05-29T21:01:32.000Z,"Bitcoin Powers to $112K, But On-Chain Metrics Warn of Potential Pause: CryptoQuant","Bitcoin continues to dominate headlines after smashing through a new all-time high of $112,000 last week, reinforcing bullish sentiment across the crypto markets . Yet, despite the hype, on-chain data from CryptoQuant suggests traders should tread with caution—a cooling period may be on the horizon. Bull Score Index Points to Bull Market Continuation According to CryptoQuant , Bitcoin remains solidly in bull market territory. The Bull Score Index—a key measure of on-chain activity—currently stands at 80. Historically, this index has reliably indicated that Bitcoin continues to trend upwards as long as it remains above 50. This strong score reflects robust participation from retail and institutional investors, further fueled by macro tailwinds and increasing global adoption. The market’s optimism is backed by substantial demand: in the past 30 days alone, Bitcoin demand grew by an estimated 229,000 BTC. While this is still under the 279,000 BTC peak seen in December 2024, it’s getting close—a potential indicator that the current buying frenzy might be losing steam. Whale Accumulation Slows, Demand Nears Historical Top Though investor enthusiasm is still evident, there are early signs that the rally could be approaching a plateau. Whale-held Bitcoin balances have climbed 2.8% in the last month—a pace that has historically preceded a slowdown in large-scale accumulation. With buying activity nearing levels associated with local tops, Bitcoin may enter a period of consolidation. CryptoQuant’s data implies that while the bull market isn’t over, the current growth rate may not be sustainable without a short-term correction or pause. Traders’ Profit Margins Hint at Imminent Resistance Another key metric to watch is the Trader’s Unrealized Profit Margin, which rose to 32% last week. When this figure nears 40%, or drops below its 30-day moving average—currently at 19%—price momentum often weakens. If Bitcoin does maintain its upward trajectory, $120K could act as the next major resistance. This level coincides with the upper band of the On-chain Traders’ Realized Price—a historical ceiling during past bull runs. In short, while the broader outlook remains bullish, CryptoQuant’s indicators suggest caution. As Bitcoin scales new heights, savvy investors should watch the metrics closely—the next few weeks could determine whether this rally continues or cools off.

2025-05-29T21:00:50.000Z,"Ethereum Spot Premium Signals Strength – $2,800 Resistance In Focus","Ethereum is showing signs of renewed strength as it continues to trade above the $2,700 level, reaching as high as $2,790 in recent hours. The price action has energized the market, with many analysts now calling for a major breakout that could not only lift ETH further but also trigger the long-awaited altseason. Related Reading: Altseason Loading? Analyst Explains How FTX $5B Distribution May Trigger The Next Bull Leg While Bitcoin has led the rally for most of the year, Ethereum appears to be catching up. According to top analyst Daan, the ETH spot premium remains firm, signaling sustained demand even in the absence of ETF-level inflows. “It doesn’t have as many ETF inflows as BTC does,” Daan noted. This relative strength, combined with growing optimism around altcoins, is fueling speculation that Ethereum could soon test—and possibly break—critical resistance levels. With sentiment turning bullish across the market and ETH gaining momentum, all eyes are now on whether it can push past key resistance and lead the charge into a broader altcoin breakout. The coming days could prove pivotal as Ethereum sets the tone for the next phase of crypto market expansion. Ethereum Tests Critical Resistance As It Faces A Pivotal Moment Ethereum is now confronting what many analysts consider the most important resistance level of the current cycle. The zone between $2,700 and $2,800 has become the battleground for ETH’s next major move. A successful breakout could trigger a run toward all-time highs, while rejection may lead to a healthy—but deeper—retracement. Global macro conditions are adding weight to this moment. Rising U.S. Treasury yields and persistent inflation continue to rattle traditional markets, increasing systemic stress. Yet, in this uncertain environment, Ethereum and Bitcoin have shown resilience, suggesting that investors are increasingly viewing them as alternatives or hedges against traditional financial risks. Daan shared insights reinforcing this bullish outlook. According to his analysis, the ETH spot premium remains firm despite lacking the ETF-driven inflows seen with Bitcoin. ETH doesn’t require as much inflow relative to its market cap to sustain bullish momentum. However, the $2,800 level remains a significant barrier. It represents a key inflection point for Ethereum’s price action and overall market sentiment. The coming days are crucial, as Ethereum’s ability to either break above or get rejected at this resistance could shape the altcoin market’s direction for the rest of the quarter. Related Reading: Dogecoin Flashes Buy Signal – Key Indicator Hints At Rebound ETH Price Analysis: Testing Key Liquidity Levels Ethereum is currently trading at $2,731 on the 4-hour chart, showing strong bullish momentum as it tests the key $2,800 resistance level. After weeks of consolidation between $2,500 and $2,700, ETH has broken out with conviction, riding higher moving averages and increased volume. The 34 EMA at $2,622 and the 50 SMA at $2,598 continue to act as dynamic support, confirming the strength of the uptrend. This breakout attempt follows a long period of compression, where ETH built a base of higher lows. Price has now surged to challenge a major resistance zone that has historically capped upward momentum. If bulls manage to flip this level into support, it could open the door to a sharp move toward $3,000 and higher. Related Reading: Solana Funding Rates Turn Negative – Early Sign Of Selling Pressure? Volume has picked up on the most recent push, a positive sign that buyers are stepping in with more confidence. Still, traders should watch closely for potential rejection or profit-taking at this key zone. If Ethereum fails to break and hold above $2,800, a short-term pullback toward the 34 EMA could follow.

2025-05-29T13:30:00.000Z,"How African innovators are using blockchain to solve real problems","While blockchain headlines in the West often focus on speculation and regulation, in Africa, it’s a different story, one rooted in necessity, innovation and grassroots adoption. The latest episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast explores this ground-up revolution with Kevin Imani, head of StarkWare’s Africa Venture Studio, who shares how communities across the continent are using blockchain to tackle real-world problems in finance, energy and connectivity.A student movement“Young students were using blockchain before it was mainstream,” Imani explained. From Kenya to Nigeria, local needs, not hype, drove early adoption. In many cases, it was students receiving digital currencies from abroad or freelancers getting paid in dollars and struggling to convert funds into local currency. With limited banking infrastructure or trust in government institutions, decentralized alternatives offered a lifeline.Imani highlighted how centralized systems like Kenya’s E-Mpesa changed access to finance, but still fall short for international payments or off-ramping digital assets. Related: Blockchain.com expands in Africa as local crypto rules take shape“You have to start becoming a trader almost,” he said, describing the convoluted process of converting stablecoins or crypto earnings into usable local funds. This trust gap has fueled peer-to-peer crypto usage. “These were kids holding stablecoins not to spend them, but to store value.” Even before regulators or startups built formal infrastructure, communities had already found use cases for blockchain.Blockchain beyond finance Beyond finance, African innovators are tapping blockchain to address energy insecurity. In rural Zambia, excess power from a mini hydro station could go to waste. Instead, residents can now use that surplus to mine Bitcoin, for example, generating revenue and creating a sustainable power loop. “It’s self-sustaining and reduces waste,” Imani said.Connectivity is another frontier. In areas where traditional internet providers fall short, decentralized WiFi hotspot networks are emerging. With blockchain, community members can share bandwidth and be compensated instantly and transparently. “You don’t need a middleman. It’s fair and trackable,” he said.Still, mainstream adoption remains cautious. Governments like those in Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa are in “standby mode,” focused more on consumer protection than full-scale implementation. But Imani remains optimistic: “The need is there. The technology is here. The only question is how we bridge that gap.”To hear the full conversation on The Clear Crypto Podcast, listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

2025-05-29T13:23:06.000Z,"Tim Berners-Lee says internet DNS should have been more decentralized","World Wide Web and hypertext markup language (HTML) inventor Tim Berners-Lee said that if he were building a domain name service (DNS) today, he would make it “more decentralized.”Speaking at ETH Prague on stage alongside Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, Berners-Lee reflected on early internet architecture decisions.“If I could go back […] I would make it more decentralized,“ he said.DNS was invented in 1983 by Paul Mockapetris, replacing the previous hosts.txt file-based system with a scalable, distributed system for naming IP addresses. Still, while Berners-Lee was not personally responsible for DNS development, he could have opted for a URL structure not tied to the DNS we know today, or he could have pushed for a decentralized alternative. Source: Mely.ethRelated: Decentralized naming could bring ‘next billion’ users to BitcoinCentralization of the DNSThe DNS system is highly centralized, particularly at its top levels of hierarchy. The root zone, which governs top-level domains such as .com and .org, is managed by the US-based nonprofit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).Furthermore, the most authoritative servers are operated by a handful of organizations, further centralizing the system. This allows for easy censorship and control by governments that can unilaterally seize or block domain names.This degree of centralization also makes outages due to centralized service disruption more likely. Control over root zones and domain policies is also concentrated in a few regions and among a select group of stakeholders.There are also concerns regarding privacy because centralized DNS queries can be monitored, logged and intercepted by internet service providers and other intermediaries.Related: Community split on ENS petition against Unstoppable Domains patentCrypto’s solution to the problemDecentralized alternatives to the DNS system are being developed. The most well-known is the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), which maps human-readable names to Ethereum addresses, content on the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS), or other data.Another alternative is Unstoppable Domains. Its system mints domains as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Ethereum and Polygon.ENS has seen a fair share of adoption. In late 2024, ENS Labs also partnered with PayPal and Venmo, sparking speculation about how this partnership is likely to boost mainstream adoption.IPFS runs on Ethereum smart contracts and aims to be user-owned and censorship-resistant. Currently, it is primarily used in Web3 applications, wallets and decentralized websites.Another alternative is Handshake (HNS), which aims to be a decentralized and permissionless naming protocol that is compatible with traditional DNS.

Ethereum Foundation turns to DeFi for cash","The Ethereum Foundation (EF) has borrowed $2 million in GHO, a decentralized stablecoin developed by Aave, in a move signaling deeper engagement with decentralized finance (DeFi) strategies.  In a May 29 X post, Aave founder Stani Kulechov said the foundation borrowed $2 million in GHO tokens. “The EF is not only supplying ETH to Aave, but also borrowing from Aave,” Kulechov wrote, describing the development as “the full DeFi circle.”GHO is a decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin native to the Aave Protocol. Unlike centralized stablecoins, GHO is governed by Aave’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which oversees interest rates, collateral requirements and facilitator selection. The move highlights the EF’s growing engagement with the DeFi ecosystem, moving toward more sophisticated treasury strategies. The foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Source: Stani KulechovEthereum Foundation previously deployed $120 million in DeFiThe foundation’s move to borrow GHO follows a previous $120 million deployment into various protocols, signaling a shift in how it manages its crypto holdings. In February, the EF deployed 45,000 Ether (ETH) across different DeFi protocols, including Aave, Spark and Compound. At the time, the Ether was worth $120 million. Kulechov previously described the fund deployment as the foundation’s “biggest allocation in DeFi.” Because of the move, the Aave founder said that DeFi will win, expressing optimism as the EF added liquidity to the protocol.Apart from Kulechov, community members also celebrated the move, supporting the EF’s ETH holdings management shift. A community member said the development was a win, saying the foundation should “keep it up,” while an X user said it would be positive if the EF continued to use their funds this way. Related: Ethereum Foundation unveils security initiative to supplant legacy systemsCriticisms of the foundation selling Ether In January, Ethereum community members called on the foundation to explore alternatives to selling ETH for operational funding. The community suggested DeFi tools like staking and borrowing stablecoins against ETH. Eric Conner, co-author of EIP-1559, criticized the ETH selling, saying that the foundation’s primary use case seemed to be dumping its holdings. He called the practice “insane,” urging the EF to stake or use DeFi instead of selling. Anthony Sassano, host of The Daily Gwei, proposed that the EF stake part of its ETH and sell the staking rewards.

We’re re-architecting everything,” said Donut founder and CEO Chris Zhu. “We’re reconstructing the front end of the internet to be hyper-financialized for AI agents.”  Donut closes $7 million pre-seed round.

Mainstream browsers will also integrate agentic capabilities or build interoperability with purpose-built agentic browsers as AI becomes cheaper, according to Zhu.However, the most significant adoption will come within the next decade when onchain and offchain environments will be completely merged for internet users, Zhu said, adding:“Agentic browsers are poised to become the default entry point — much like smartphones replaced feature phones.”In the long term, Donut aims to support payments, gaming, content creation and social interaction, all within a single crypto-native browser. The company also plans to leverage advancements in decentralized identity and confidential computing to turn the browser into a personal “crypto CFO” for retail users.

Source: TradingViewFor SOL/ETH, this projects a downside target for July, near 0.038 ETH, representing a 40% decline from current levels.The 50-week exponential moving average (50-week EMA; the red wave) around 0.0628 ETH is offering interim support. A decisive weekly close below this level would likely confirm the bearish continuation toward the 0.038 ETH target.A bounce, on the other hand, could have SOL reclaim the wedge’s lower trendline as support, which may delay the breakdown scenario. Breaking above the wedge’s upper trendline will likely invalidate the 40% crash setup altogether.Cooling memecoin frenzy hints at SOL/ETH crashThe breakdown in SOL/ETH aligns with a visible decline in memecoin-driven activity on Solana. A key indicator is Pump.fun, the largest memecoin launch platform on the network, which shows a sharp drop in daily fee revenue since early April.

Source: CoinMarketCapThe Trump administration has reportedly filed an appeal to the court’s decision and Hundal said that regardless of whether it presents a new justification for the tariffs, the market sentiment has already changed.“It blows a hole in trade talks either way, and that means we’re likely to witness a significant repositioning in the market.”On April 2, Trump signed an executive order and claimed emergency powers, levying so-called “reciprocal tariffs” on every country starting at 10%.Trump’s initial tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China, introduced in early February, were widely seen as the primary catalyst behind Bitcoin falling below $100,000 and staying under the psychological level until May 8, as broader macroeconomic uncertainty intensified.“The trade war likely delayed a meaningful greed, really — but it didn’t bury it. The trend is higher,” Hundal said.

However, he added that the time he spent on DOGE wasn’t as significant as many believed, and he blamed media coverage for overrepresenting his involvement.“It’s not like I left the companies. It was just relative time allocation that probably was a little too high on the government side, and I’ve reduced that significantly in recent weeks.”When Musk announced in Tesla’s first quarter report that his time spent on DOGE would drop significantly in May, Tesla (TSLA) shares rose over 5% in after-hours trading, despite the company reporting an 80% drop in net income.As of March 31, Tesla still held 11,509 Bitcoin (BTC), currently valued at about $1.24 billion.Related: Musk confirms X Money beta testing ahead of planned 2025 launchTesla shares are still down 5.9% year to date, in part due to Musk diverting his attention away from the company and Tesla’s sales falling considerably in the first quarter.However, the fall is in line with other Big Tech firms, including Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG), which are also in the red in 2025.Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/elon-musk-leaves-doge-admit-tougher-than-expected?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-29T00:46:21.000Z,"US court freezes $57M USDC allegedly linked to LIBRA scandal","A US federal court has frozen around $57.65 million worth of the stablecoin USDC in a class action case over the controversial Libra memecoin.Onchain data shared with Cointelegraph by the class group’s lawyer, Max Burwick, shows nearly $57 million worth of USDC (USDC) was frozen on May 28 after a Manhattan court agreed to a temporary freeze.“Yesterday, a federal court in SDNY [Southern District of New York] entered a Temporary Restraining Order at our request, Burwick Law, supported by Tim Treanor, freezing approximately 57.65 million USDC held at Circle,“ Burwick told Cointelegraph.He added that the court is scheduled to hold a hearing on June 9 to determine whether the assets will remain frozen as the class-action lawsuit progresses.Burwick is representing Omar Hurlock and other plaintiffs in a class-action suit against crypto venture firm Kelsier Ventures and its three sibling co-founders, Gideon, Thomas and Hayden Davis, on March 17, alleging they created the Libra (LIBRA) cryptocurrency and misled investors to siphon over $100 million from one-sided liquidity pools.The suit also named blockchain infrastructure companies, KIP Protocol and its CEO, Julian Peh, along with Meteora and its co-founder, Benjamin Chow, as defendants.Chow’s lawyer, Kelsier Ventures and KIP Protocol were contacted for comment. LIBRA reached a $4 billion market cap following an X post from Argentine President Javier Milei on Feb. 14 before crashing 94% hours later.The saga caused a political scandal for Milei, prompting members of Argentina’s opposition party to call for his impeachment, though little traction was gained beyond those statements.Data from polling platform Zuban Córdoba in March suggested that the Libra scandal negatively impacted Milei’s image and the national management approval rating.Two Solana wallets with total USDC balances worth $57.65 million were frozen on May 28 at 3:15 am and 3:18 am UTC.Data from Solana’s blockchain explorer, Solscan, shows that the address “3Fwr…ZQpK” had $44.59 million worth of the stablecoin frozen, while a little over $13 million was frozen from the wallet address “3nHw…xNgH.”Both wallets were frozen by the Multisig Freeze Authority, Solscan data shows.Milei closes Libra investigation in ArgentinaOn May 19, Milei signed a decree to shut down a task force established to investigate the Libra scandal.Related: Solana may be a memecoin ‘one-trick pony’ — Standard CharteredNo action was taken against Milei or any other Argentine official allegedly tied to the scandal.However, some critics say a legitimate investigation wasn’t properly conducted in the first place.“It was always a fake, they never dared to investigate anything at all, and they’re covering each other up because they’re completely up to their necks in it,” Itai Hagman, an economist and member of the Chamber of Deputies of Argentina, said in a May 20 X post.Magazine: Memecoins are ded — But Solana ‘100x better’ despite revenue plunge",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-court-freezes-57-million-libra-memecoin-case?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

However, the altcoin has maintained a positive signal by closing above the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA) for three consecutive weeks. This critical level has historically acted as a catalyst for significant price rallies.Solana 1-week chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewIn late 2023, SOL broke through the 50-week and 100-week EMAs, solidifying its position above these levels before surging 515% by March 2024. The relative strength index or RSI on the weekly chart is currently at 52.60, indicating growing buying pressure. This setup mirrors past patterns where SOL broke above the 50-week EMA and rallied significantly. With current technicals aligning, SOL appears poised to retest the $300 level by late 2025, a key psychological and historical resistance.Using trend-based Fibonacci (FIB) extensions, SOL’s potential upside could be more compelling. The FIB extension, taken to the January highs of $295 from the recent swing lows near $95, outlines an immediate target of around $300, or a 70% increase.Solana Fibonacci trend extension analysis. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewOnce SOL price enters price discovery, bullish momentum could target the 1.618 extension, suggesting SOL could reach as high as $418. However, failure to hold the 50-week EMA could cause SOL retest the lower support near $157. Related: Solana may be a memecoin ‘one-trick pony’ — Standard CharteredSolana traders debate SOL’s next breakout catalystWhile Solana continues to trade nearly 40% below its all-time high, SOL futures market activity remains robust. According to CoinGlass, Solana futures open interest (OI) stands at $7.5 billion — just $1 billion short of its Jan. 19, 2025, peak of $8.5 billion. Elevated OI levels typically signal heightened speculative interest and suggest that traders are positioning for significant price volatility.Solana futures open interest. Source: CoinGlassFunding rates across exchanges have also turned negative, indicating a tilt toward short positions as SOL struggles to reclaim the key $180 resistance. While this often reflects bearish sentiment, it also opens the door for a potential short squeeze. Crypto futures analyst Byzantine General pointed out that current market conditions — characterized by elevated OI, rising aggregated volume, and relatively muted cross-exchange funding — suggest that SOL price may be stabilizing. He noted this setup could catalyze a sharp upside move, with the possibility of a breakout toward the $300 level if momentum builds.Solana price, aggregated open interest, volume, and funding rate.

If the pattern plays out, the trader warned that SOL could revisit $157 to $152 in the short term.The $180 level remains the critical inflection point. A decisive move above it could confirm a bullish continuation, while rejection may lead to a healthy correction to the $150–$160 range.Related: Ether price target shifts to $3K after SharpLink adopts ETH ‘treasury strategy’This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-28T22:20:00.000Z,"Ethereum bulls aim for $2.7K ahead of ETH’s $2.4B options expiry","Key takeaways:97% of ETH put options will expire worthless if ETH holds above $2,600.A bullish ETH price outcome could be limited by macroeconomic factors and trading strategies that cap Ether gains.On May 30, $2.4 billion in Ether (ETH) options will expire—an event that could support ETH’s attempt to break above the $2,700 mark for the first time in over three months. Despite the recent gains, Ether is down 21% in 2025, while the broader cryptocurrency market has seen a 5% increase.Ether bulls are motivated to keep ETH above $2,600 ahead of the monthly expiry. However, weak network activity on Ethereum suggests that the upside potential may be limited.Ether/USD (blue) vs. Total crypto capitalization (green). Source: TradingView / CointelegraphAnalysts believe Ether’s underperformance stems from rising competition among blockchains focused on decentralized applications. Still, ETH holds a key advantage as the only altcoin with a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) offering in the United States. These ETFs attracted $287 million in net inflows between May 19 and May 27, reflecting increased interest from institutional investors.Even as demand for Ether-based investment products grows, deposits and onchain activity on the Ethereum network have declined. This trend is especially troubling as rivals like Solana, BNB Chain, and Tron continue to gain market share. Ethereum no longer ranks among the top ten protocols in terms of fees, creating a supply imbalance that contributes to inflationary pressure on ETH.Sell (put) options ill-prepared for ETH prices above $2,600ETH options aggregate open interest, USD. Source: Laevitas.chEven though the $1.3 billion in call (buy) options dominate the May 30 expiry, that doesn’t necessarily imply that those traders will reinvest the proceeds in new bullish positions. Many option strategies involve multiple maturities and are structured in ways that don’t benefit from ETH rising above specific thresholds. Additionally, traders may hedge their exposure through futures markets.The $1.1 billion in put (sell) options were clearly caught off guard, as 97% were set at $2,600 or lower. These contracts will expire worthless if ETH holds above that level at 8:00 am UTC on May 30. While this imbalance is unusual, a similar outcome could affect the overly optimistic call options with strike prices at $2,800 and above if ETH remains near current levels.Related: SharpLink launches Ethereum treasury, taps Joe Lubin as board chairBelow are four likely scenarios based on current price trends. These outcomes estimate theoretical profits based on open interest imbalances and do not account for complex strategies.Between $2,300 and $2,500: $420 million in calls (buy) vs. $220 million in puts (sell). The net result favors the call instruments by $200 million.Between $2,500 and $2,600: $500 million calls vs. $130 million puts, favoring calls by $370 million.Between $2,600 and $2,700: $590 million calls vs. $35 million puts, favoring calls by $555 million.Between $2,700 and $2,900: $780 million calls vs. $10 million puts, favoring calls by $770 million.Bulls are strongly incentivized to push ETH past $2,700, yet the broader context may override those efforts. Given the strong correlation between cryptocurrencies and the S&P 500, macroeconomic indicators and corporate earnings are likely to remain the primary forces shaping investor risk appetite—and ultimately, ETH’s price at the time of the monthly options expiry.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-28T21:49:46.000Z,"Labor Department rescinds Biden-era guidance for crypto in 401(k) plans","The US Labor Department has officially rescinded guidance issued during the Biden administration that limited the inclusion of cryptocurrency in 401(k) retirement plans.On May 28, the Labor Department revoked a 2022 guidance that had urged fiduciaries to be “extremely cautious” when considering cryptocurrency for 401(k) retirement plans. The move could give asset managers more flexibility to include digital assets in retirement investment options.The government agency removed the guidance asserting that it represented a departure from the department’s “historically neutral, principled-based approach to fiduciary investment decisions.”“We’re rolling back this overreach and making it clear that investment decisions should be made by fiduciaries, not D.C. bureaucrats,” said US Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer. The Labor Department under Biden criticized the practice of marketing cryptocurrencies to 401(k) participants. At the time, the agency claimed cryptocurrencies posed “significant risks and challenges” to participants’ retirement accounts due to their “speculative and volatile” nature and “valuation concerns,” among other reasons.The American Banking Association (ABA) criticized the 2022 compliance release, claiming that it did not make the guidance available for public comment and review prior to issuance.Related: Fidelity introduces retirement accounts with minimal-fee crypto investingTrump administration shifts crypto landscapePresident Trump has pledged to make the United States “the world capital of crypto” during his 2024 campaign.Under his administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission has scaled back several enforcement actions and investigations involving Web3 companies such as Uniswap, Coinbase, and Kraken, while also engaging in policy discussions on topics like real-world asset tokenization and the regulatory status of certain tokens.

2025-05-28T21:22:22.000Z,"Bitcoin analyst says BTC price peak in $220K to $330K range still possible","Key takeaways:Bitcoin researcher Sminston With says BTC could gain 100% to 200%, with a cycle peak between $220,000 to $330,000.Bitcoin continues to exhibit strong cyclical volatility, contradicting the belief that its price swings are softening over time.Over $4 billion in BTC has been moved by long-term holders, warning of a price correction.Analysis from Bitcoin (BTC) researcher Sminston With implied that a BTC price peak is still 100% to 200% away from current prices. In a recent X post, With shared a Bitcoin price chart using a 365-day simple moving average (SMA) aligned with a power law model (R²=0.96). The model suggests Bitcoin’s price follows a predictable, non-random pattern over time, distinct from the exponential growth models often applied to stocks and equities.Bitcoin power law fit analysis by Sminston With. Source: XThe chart revealed that Bitcoin’s 365-day SMA typically peaks 2 to 3 times above the power law trendline in each market cycle. With Bitcoin priced at $110,000 on May 27, this model projects a potential cycle top between $220,000 and $330,000. This forecast aligns with historical patterns, where Bitcoin has consistently overshot this trendline during bullish phases, offering an optimistic outlook for investors.A second graph in the post highlights Bitcoin’s price deviation from the power law fit, showing steady cyclical volatility without exponential decay in sustained peaks. This challenges the common belief that Bitcoin’s price cycles are becoming less extreme over time, indicating that the cryptocurrency’s volatility remains a defining trait, potentially leading to significant price swings over the next few months. In Q3 2024, With accurately predicted that Bitcoin would reach a six-figure price by January 2025, when BTC was trading around $60,000. The analysis examined each decaying peak by assessing BTC’s price at cycle highs. A decaying period in an investment cycle occurs when a strategy’s returns decline as the opportunity becomes widely adopted, culminating in a peak where the asset’s value drops sharply, leading to mass profit-taking.With’s quarter-on-quarter price targets for 2025, as outlined in this analysis, are summarized below.Bitcoin returns in 2025 based on decaying peaks.
