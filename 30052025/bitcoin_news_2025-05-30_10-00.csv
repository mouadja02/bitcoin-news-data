2025-05-30T07:48:22.000Z,"How Will the Crypto Market React to Bitcoin & Ethereum Options Expiry Today?","The post How Will the Crypto Market React to Bitcoin & Ethereum Options Expiry Today? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is bracing for a big event today, just one day after the Bitcoin Conference 2025 wrapped up in Las Vegas on May 29. The conference, filled with optimism and new ideas, has set a hopeful tone. But now, with more than $11 billion in Bitcoin and Ethereum options expiring today, traders are worried that this will lead to massive volatility ahead. $9.8B Bitcoin Options Expiry Today According to data from Deribit , a leading crypto derivatives platform, around 92,459 Bitcoin contracts will expire today. These contracts are worth nearly $9.8 billion, a significant jump from last week’s figures. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at around $105,982, down about 1.9% in the past 24 hours. The maximum pain price, the level where most options lose money, is $100,000. Although this is below the current price, analysts think Bitcoin won’t drop all the way to that level. Traders have set a put-to-call ratio of 0.89, showing more bets on price gains. $1.6 Billion Ethereum Options Expiry Ethereum is also seeing a big expiry day, with 623,949 contracts worth about $1.6 billion set to expire today, again according to Deribit data. Ethereum’s price is currently at $2,600, down about 4% in the past 24 hours. Its maximum pain price is $2,300, while the put-to-call ratio of 0.81 suggests that traders still believe prices could go higher. How the Crypto Market Could React Today This week’s Bitcoin and Ethereum options expiry is much bigger, covering the whole month. Historically, big monthly expiries like this can lead to short-term volatility, as traders adjust their positions or hedge against sudden price swings. Meanwhile, Bitcoin traders seem split, as some hope for a price rise, while others are cautious and ready to protect themselves. On the other hand Ethereum’s market looks balanced, with chances to grow but also some caution. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-30T07:30:47.000Z,"Ross Ulbricht Gets Hero’s Welcome at Bitcoin 2025, Says ‘Fight for Freedom isn’t Over’","Ross Ulbricht made his first public appearance at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas as a free man, after spending over a decade in prison for his role in running the darknet website Silk Road, before U.S. President Trump pardoned him . An emotional Ross thanked the Bitcoin community for its continuous support. On 29 May 2015, a federal judge had sent Ross to serve a double-life sentence plus 40 years in prison without the possiblity of parole. Silk Road founder reflected on his time in prison saying, “there were days when I thought I would die in that awful cage,” but he fought to find joy even in the darkest time. Addressing the attendees, Ross said that the idea he risked his life and lost freedom for, grew into a movement. A movement so big that a decade later it came back around to free him, he added. “There is still more freedom to be won” Ross revealed that after he appeared at Bitcoin conference in 2021 through a phone call from prison, he was thrown into solitary confinement and put under heavy surveillance. But he said it was worth it and it made him feel like that for a moment he broke through the prison. “Today is the mirror image of that,” he noted. Talking about winning back his freedom, he said, “winning your freedom feels as amazing as losing it feels awful.” Ross declared from the stage that we’re not there yet, there is still more freedom to be won and there’s still more work to be done. “Freedom is worth the struggle,” he added. Ross is catching up with latest technology Ross Ulbricht is still catching up with the technology after coming out of a “time capsule.” He noted: “I effectively went into a time capsule in 2013 and now I’m coming out like Rip Van Winkle. I mean, just a few months ago when I walked out of prison, I’d never seen a drone. I had never experienced VR or chatted with AI.” Talking about the developments in the crypto industry since he went to prison, Ross said, when he launched Silk Road there was just one exchange you could buy bitcoin on. “Now, it seems like every app I download has a built-in wallet with one-click buying options.” He added that There are dozens of new cryptocurrencies and blockchains, each one fascinating in its own right. “There’s DeFi and Web 3 and now there’s AI to help me navigate it all. It’s nuts.” In a heartfelt video montage that played before he took the stage, scenes of Ulbricht adjusting to life beyond prison filled the screen. He was seen walking on the beach, learning to surf, sharing quiet moments with his wife and enjoying the newfound freedom. “Freedom, decentralization and unity” Ross concluded his speech by reminding the bitcoin community about the three core principles that they should stick by to grow further – freedom, decentralization and unity. Recalling his time in prison, Ross said that guards and administration like when prisoners are divided, that way it’s easier to rule them. But when the prisoners were united, the administration listened, he added. “When we all went on hunger strike together, they showed up and listened.” Ross urged the crypto community to not see each other as enemies. “So long as we can agree that we deserve freedom and that decentralization is how we secure it, then we can be united, we can have each other’s backs, just like you had mine, freedom, decentralization, unity. Stay true to these principles and the future is ours.” The post Ross Ulbricht Gets Hero’s Welcome at Bitcoin 2025, Says ‘Fight for Freedom isn’t Over’ appeared first on Cryptonews .",cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/ross-ulbricht-gets-heros-welcome-at-bitcoin-2025/,"BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY","Bitcoin News|Bitcoin|Ross Ulbricht",cryptocompare

Hence, we expect the BTC price to create a 2025 high of ~$168,000. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $71,827.81 $119,713.02 $167,598.22 Bitcoin Price Prediction June 2025 In May 2025, Bitcoin’s unstoppable ascent showed a nice and steady rise. This recovery was possible due to easing tensions from the trade tariffs war, which led BTC to surge to a new all-time high of $112K. The price fell back recently as a post by Donald Trump brought back the trade tensions with european union this time, which led to a brief dip to $108K. But, 48 hours later he paused the recent impose with EU until June 9th.This move stopped the situation to get worsened. However, despite that, bears took it down to $105K, and recently it is taking 20-day EMA support. When the pause was announced, it seemed like the positivity and bullish narratives would quickly return to the table from crypto traders, and it would take out the $112K resistance, but the bulls’ strength felt short to flip $112K.. Now, in the past couple of days, its price action is withdrawing back from its all-time high level, and it seems like it is on the verge of falling to the 50-day EMA band in the short term, around $ 100 K. Also, the Market sentiment has shifted from optimistic to pessimistic. The BTC long/short ratio currently stands at 0.9501, which has declined from 1.0288, indicating that bulls have weakened. This shows that bullish forces have halted the momentum in the short term, and bears are not on the sidelines anymore; they are kicking in to push the price lower. However, if a situation changes in the short term and bearishness wanes, then the newly formed all-time high must be taken out. If it does, then it will enter price discovery mode. In that condition, BTC could target a near-term target of $120,000, with the potential for even higher levels in the coming months. However, if bulls fail toreignite momentum then a pullback to $100,000 or lower, could be likely. Supporting this cautious view, on-chain data reveals that a substantial amount of dormant Bitcoin, unmoved for 1 to 2 years, 180-days to 1year, and 90-days to 180 days has recently become active. This kind of movement is often interpreted as a bearish signal, suggesting that short-term holders below 2 years might be preparing to sell. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 A key factor driving the potential for higher Bitcoin prices is the relationship with global liquidity. Historical trends reveal that as global M2 increases, Bitcoin often experiences dramatic price surges. Now, with global liquidity beginning to rise again after a prolonged period of stagnation, the stage seems set for another major rally in Bitcoin’s value. This shift in liquidity could create the perfect environment for Bitcoin to soar once more. Also, cryptoquant data suggest that accumulation is on top with exchange reserve declining at more alarming rates. When writing 2.4 Milliion BTC were in total on the exchange reserves, which is a strong decline from a year ago when reserves were 3.1 Million BTC.

2025-05-30T07:20:12.000Z,"Pantera Capital’s Smart Strategy: Investing in Companies with Crypto Reserves","BitcoinWorld Pantera Capital’s Smart Strategy: Investing in Companies with Crypto Reserves Are you curious about how major players in the crypto space are navigating the market? Investment strategies are constantly evolving, and Pantera Capital, a prominent name in cryptocurrency investment, recently revealed a fascinating approach. They are looking beyond direct investment in digital assets and putting capital into publicly listed companies that hold significant crypto reserves on their balance sheets. This move signals a growing trend in how institutional players view and interact with the digital asset ecosystem. Why are Companies Building Crypto Reserves ? The idea of a company holding cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum as part of its corporate treasury might seem unconventional to some, but it’s a strategy gaining traction. Companies adopt this approach for various reasons: Inflation Hedge: With concerns about fiat currency devaluation, some companies see assets like Bitcoin as a potential store of value that can appreciate over time, preserving purchasing power. Balance Sheet Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset class like crypto can diversify a company’s holdings beyond traditional cash, bonds, and stocks. Alignment with Future Technologies: For companies operating in or adjacent to the tech sector, holding crypto can align their balance sheet with the decentralized future they might be building or interacting with. Attracting Talent and Investors: For some, having crypto reserves can signal forward-thinking leadership and potentially appeal to employees and investors interested in the digital asset space. This trend of companies accumulating crypto reserves provides a new avenue for investors like Pantera Capital to gain exposure to the digital asset market indirectly. Exploring Pantera Capital’s Investment Choices Pantera Capital, in a note to its investors, highlighted specific companies they have invested in due to their strategic decision to hold cryptocurrencies. This provides concrete examples of their strategy in action. According to reports, these include: Twenty One Capital: Described as a cryptocurrency venture company with a focus on Bitcoin investments. Investing here provides Pantera exposure to a company whose core business revolves around the leading cryptocurrency. DeFi Development: This entity has reportedly adopted Solana (SOL) as a strategic reserve asset. This investment gives Pantera exposure not just to a specific altcoin, but to a company actively involved in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, utilizing SOL within that ecosystem. SharpLink Gaming: This company has chosen to hold Ethereum (ETH) as a reserve asset. Investing in SharpLink Gaming offers Pantera exposure to a company in the gaming sector that sees value in holding the second-largest cryptocurrency, likely recognizing its importance in areas like NFTs and decentralized applications. These examples showcase Pantera’s diversified approach, targeting companies holding different key cryptocurrencies, reflecting varying strategic decisions by those companies. Is This a Smarter Institutional Investment Strategy? Pantera Capital articulated a clear rationale for investing in these companies rather than just buying the underlying cryptocurrencies directly. They believe this approach can offer greater upside potential . But why might that be the case? Investing in a public company holding crypto reserves means you are not just betting on the price movement of the crypto asset itself. You are also investing in the company’s core business, its growth prospects, management, and operational efficiency. If the company is successful in its primary business while also benefiting from the appreciation of its crypto holdings, the investment’s return could potentially outperform a simple direct investment in the crypto asset alone. Consider a scenario where a company uses its crypto reserves strategically, perhaps leveraging them for financing, integrating them into services, or simply benefiting from their balance sheet value while its main operations generate significant profit. The value derived from the successful core business combined with the crypto appreciation could provide a compounding effect not available through direct crypto ownership. Furthermore, investing in publicly listed companies often comes with layers of regulation, reporting requirements, and corporate governance that might appeal to large institutional investment firms seeking structures they are familiar with. What are the Potential Benefits of This Approach? For an investor like Pantera Capital, and potentially for other institutional investment firms considering similar strategies, the benefits can be numerous: Indirect Exposure with Structure: Gaining exposure to crypto price movements through regulated, publicly traded entities. Potential for Compounded Returns: Upside from both the underlying crypto asset’s performance and the company’s business growth. Access to Specific Sectors: Investing in companies allows targeted exposure to sectors like gaming, DeFi, or venture capital that are actively using or focused on specific cryptocurrencies. Familiar Investment Vehicle: Public stocks are a traditional asset class, making this strategy potentially easier to integrate into existing portfolios and risk management frameworks compared to direct crypto holdings. Regulatory Clarity (Relative): While crypto regulation is evolving, investing in a regulated public company provides a degree of familiarity and existing legal frameworks. This method provides a nuanced way to participate in the crypto market’s growth, blending traditional equity investment with digital asset exposure. Are There Downsides or Challenges? No investment strategy is without its risks. Investing in companies with crypto reserves introduces unique challenges: Double-Edged Sword of Volatility: The company’s stock price can be affected by both the volatility of its core business and the extreme volatility of its crypto holdings. Company-Specific Risk: You are exposed to the operational risks, management decisions, and financial health of the specific company, independent of the crypto market. Valuation Complexity: Valuing a company with significant, volatile crypto assets on its balance sheet can be more complex than valuing a traditional company or simply valuing the crypto asset itself. Correlation Risk: In market downturns, both the company’s stock and its crypto reserves might fall in tandem, amplifying losses. Tax and Accounting Issues: How companies manage and report their crypto reserves can introduce accounting complexities that might impact their financial statements. Investors must carefully evaluate both the company’s fundamentals and the potential impact of its crypto holdings. How Does This Differ from Direct Crypto Investment? Directly buying Bitcoin , Ethereum , or Solana means you own the asset itself. Your investment performance is directly tied to the price fluctuations of that specific cryptocurrency. Investing in a company with crypto reserves adds a layer of indirection. With direct crypto, you manage your own wallets, keys, and security. With company stock, you rely on the company’s management to handle the custody and strategic use of the crypto assets. Direct crypto offers pure exposure to the asset’s price. Investing in a company offers exposure to the asset’s price *plus* the performance of the company’s business. For large institutional investment firms, the infrastructure, regulatory environment, and reporting requirements around public equities are often more established than those for direct crypto holdings, making the company-based approach potentially more accessible or preferable for certain mandates. What Does This Mean for the Future of Institutional Investment ? Pantera Capital’s strategy is indicative of a broader trend: institutional capital is finding increasingly sophisticated ways to enter the crypto market. While direct investment in Bitcoin ETFs and other funds is growing, strategies involving equity in crypto-exposed companies offer alternative risk/reward profiles. As more companies adopt crypto reserves, either as a treasury strategy or because their business involves digital assets, the universe of investable public companies with significant crypto exposure will likely grow. This provides traditional investors and crypto-focused funds like Pantera more options beyond simply buying crypto directly. This evolution suggests that the lines between traditional finance and the crypto world will continue to blur, creating new hybrid investment opportunities and strategies for sophisticated investors. Conclusion: A Strategic Evolution in Crypto Exposure Pantera Capital’s investment in publicly listed companies holding crypto reserves represents a notable strategic move in the institutional investment landscape. By targeting entities like Twenty One Capital, DeFi Development, and SharpLink Gaming, which hold assets like Bitcoin , Solana, and Ethereum , Pantera aims to capture potentially greater upside than direct crypto investment alone. This approach leverages the growth potential of both the underlying digital assets and the companies’ core businesses. While this strategy introduces unique complexities and risks compared to direct crypto ownership, it offers a structured, potentially more familiar pathway for large investors to gain exposure to the burgeoning digital asset class. It underscores the maturing of the crypto market and the innovative ways institutional capital is finding to participate in its future.

Here Are the Details","US-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced a total net outflow of $358.6 million on Thursday, ending a 10-day streak of positive inflows totaling $4.26 billion across 12 ETFs. US Spot Bitcoin ETFs See $358 Million Net Outflow: 10-Day Inflow Streak Ends BlackRock’s IBIT fund was the exception of the day, recording net inflows of $125 million alone, according to data provider SoSoValue. Other major providers suffered significant losses: Fidelity's FBTC fund: $166.32 million exit Grayscale's GBTC fund: $107.53 million exit Ark & 21Shares’ ARKB fund: $89.22 million exit Bitwise's BITB fund: $70.85 million exit Other ETF providers including VanEck, Valkyrie, Invesco and Franklin Templeton also reported outflows. Thursday’s outflows represent the largest daily net outflow in spot Bitcoin ETFs since March 11. Total trading volume in the ETFs rose to $5.39 billion from $3.5 billion the day before. Despite the outflows, IBIT’s strong performance was notable. IBIT led most of the 10-day inflow series, attracting over $4 billion in funds alone during that time. The total cumulative net inflow of ETFs was $45.34 billion on Wednesday, but fell to $44.99 billion as of Thursday. Meanwhile, US-listed spot Ethereum ETFs recorded net inflows for the ninth consecutive day, with a total of $91.93 million entering these funds on Thursday. Market Movements Bitcoin was traded at $106,204, down 1.38% in the last 24 hours. Ethereum fell 3.3% to $2,639.

Are traditional investors selling US Treasuries to buy bitcoin? pic.twitter.com/QKR8YgcyPP — André Dragosch, PhD (@Andre_Dragosch) May 29, 2025 Highlighting a chart titled “Rolling Correlation: 10-Year UST Futures”, Dragosch has revealed that the 60-day correlation between Bitcoin and the US 10-Year Treasury Futures has plummeted to its lowest level ever recorded. The revelation has triggered a serious discussion on ‘are traditional investors selling US Treasuries to buy Bitcoin?’ US 10-Year Treasury Yield: A Simple Analysis At the start of April, the US 10-Year Bond Yield was 4.213%. Though at a point on April 4, it slipped as low as 3.859%, between April 7 and 11, it climbed steeply by 15.44%. On April 11, it hit the month’s peak of 4.590%. After hitting the peak, the market witnessed two minor corrections that month: a 4.48% correction b/w April 14 and 16 and a 4.34% correction b/w April 24 and 29. In the early half of this month, the US 10-Year Bond Yield saw a steady rise. Between May 1 and 21, it surged by 9.99%. At one point on May 22, it reached a peak of 4.629%. Currently, the yield sits at 4.420% – at least 4.49% below the peak of the month. Bitcoin Price Action: An Overview At the beginning of April, the Bitcoin price was $82,497.20. Although between April 1 and 8, the price dropped by 10.27%, between April 9 and 30, it almost steadily grew by 23.34%. In the early half of this month, the Bitcoin market also witnessed a steep increase. Between May 1 and 22 alone, the market jumped by 18.63%, from $94,123.24 to a peak of $11,653.95. Since May 23, the market has dropped by over 5.16%. A Final Note During May, both US 10-Year Treasury Yield and Bitcoin price saw significant increases, indicating a risk-on environment where both traditional safe assets and riskier assets were bought. However, Bitcoin’s initial April drop while yields also fluctuated, then its subsequent strong recovery coinciding with rising yields, hints at some capital rotation into Bitcoin as bond attractiveness waned. The subsequent minor corrections in both assets at the end of April and May suggest some profit-taking or shifting market sentiment. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-30T07:10:35.000Z,"Tether Reserves Reveal Massive Bitcoin and Gold Holdings, Boosting Confidence in USDT Stablecoin","BitcoinWorld Tether Reserves Reveal Massive Bitcoin and Gold Holdings, Boosting Confidence in USDT Stablecoin Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin, USDT, frequently finds itself under the spotlight regarding the assets backing its value. Maintaining transparency around its reserves is crucial for user trust and the stability of the broader cryptocurrency market. Recent disclosures from Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas offered a significant update on the composition of the company’s Tether reserves, highlighting substantial Bitcoin holdings and considerable Gold reserves. What Exactly Did Tether Disclose About Its Crypto Reserves? Speaking to attendees, Paolo Ardoino confirmed that Tether holds over 100,000 BTC. At the time of the announcement, this Bitcoin holdings position was valued at more than $10 billion, underscoring Tether’s significant stake in the leading cryptocurrency. Beyond digital assets, Ardoino also revealed that Tether possesses over 50 tons of physical gold as part of its Tether reserves, adding a traditional safe-haven asset to its portfolio. This announcement, reported by CoinDesk, provides a more granular look at the assets underpinning the USDT stablecoin, which aims to maintain a 1:1 peg with the U.S. dollar. While Tether regularly publishes attestations regarding its reserves, specific details like the exact amounts of particular assets like Bitcoin and gold offer valuable insight into their strategy and the depth of their backing. Why Are Strong Stablecoin Reserves So Important? The stability and trustworthiness of a stablecoin like USDT are directly tied to the quality and accessibility of its underlying reserves. These reserves are the assets that stablecoin issuers hold to back the value of the tokens in circulation. When a user wants to redeem their USDT, Tether is expected to be able to provide them with the equivalent value in U.S. dollars or other assets. Key functions of robust stablecoin reserves include: Maintaining the Peg: Sufficient reserves allow the issuer to manage supply and demand, buying back tokens if the price dips below the peg or issuing new ones if demand drives the price above. Enabling Redemptions: Users need confidence that they can redeem their stablecoins for the underlying asset (in USDT’s case, USD) at any time. Strong, liquid reserves ensure this capability. Building Trust: Transparency and strength in reserves are fundamental to building and maintaining user trust in the stablecoin issuer and the token itself. Tether’s disclosure of specific, large crypto reserves like Bitcoin holdings and Gold reserves is intended to reinforce this trust by demonstrating tangible asset backing. What Do These Massive Bitcoin Holdings Signify? Tether has publicly stated its strategy to allocate a portion of its profits into investments, including Bitcoin. Holding over 100,000 BTC makes Tether one of the most significant non-public company holders of Bitcoin globally. This indicates: Confidence in Bitcoin: Tether views Bitcoin as a valuable asset class and a potential store of value, suitable for inclusion in its Tether reserves. Diversification Strategy: Including Bitcoin diversifies the reserve portfolio beyond traditional assets like Treasury Bills, potentially offering different risk/reward characteristics. Market Impact: While these holdings weren’t acquired overnight, Tether’s continuous accumulation has likely been a factor in Bitcoin’s market dynamics, positioning them as a major player in the crypto reserves space. This level of Bitcoin holdings adds a substantial, albeit volatile, component to the stablecoin reserves. Is Gold Reserves Tether’s Play for Traditional Investors? The inclusion of over 50 tons of physical gold is a notable aspect of Tether’s Tether reserves strategy. Gold has historically been seen as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. By holding physical gold, Tether is adding a tangible, widely recognized store of value to its backing assets. This could potentially appeal to a broader range of investors, including those more comfortable with traditional assets than purely digital ones. The decision to include Gold reserves suggests a move towards a more diversified and perhaps more conservative element within the crypto reserves mix, balancing newer digital assets like Bitcoin with established traditional assets. How Does This Disclosure Impact Confidence in the USDT Stablecoin? Transparency regarding stablecoin reserves has been a major point of discussion and sometimes contention in the crypto industry. By publicly stating the specific amounts of significant assets like Bitcoin and gold, Tether aims to increase confidence in the backing of the USDT stablecoin. For many users and market participants, knowing that tangible and high-value assets form a significant part of the Tether reserves provides reassurance. While discussions about the full auditability and liquidity of all reserve components continue, this direct disclosure from the CEO at a major industry event is a step towards greater openness regarding their stablecoin reserves. Key Takeaways for Readers: Tether holds significant amounts of both Bitcoin (over 100k BTC) and physical gold (over 50 tons) in its reserves. These assets form a substantial part of the backing for the USDT stablecoin. Holding Bitcoin reflects a strategic investment and diversification into digital assets. Holding gold adds a traditional, tangible store of value to the Tether reserves. These disclosures aim to increase transparency and confidence in Tether’s ability to back USDT. Paolo Ardoino’s announcement at Bitcoin 2025 provides a clear snapshot of two major components within the Tether reserves: massive Bitcoin holdings and substantial Gold reserves. This revelation underscores Tether’s strategy to diversify its backing assets and reinforces its position as a major player not just in stablecoins but also as a significant holder of key traditional and digital assets. For users of the USDT stablecoin and observers of the crypto reserves market, this transparency is a crucial factor in evaluating the stablecoin’s reliability and the overall health of the stablecoin reserves landscape.

2025-05-30T07:00:19.000Z,"Unlock Bitcoin Yield: Amboss Rails Revolutionizes Lightning Network Passive Income","BitcoinWorld Unlock Bitcoin Yield: Amboss Rails Revolutionizes Lightning Network Passive Income Are you holding Bitcoin and looking for ways to make it work for you beyond just price appreciation? The world of cryptocurrency is constantly evolving, and finding opportunities for Bitcoin Yield is becoming increasingly sought after. Traditionally, earning yield on crypto often involved lending platforms that required you to give up custody of your assets. But what if you could earn yield while keeping your Bitcoin safe and sound in your own wallet? That’s where a new development on the Lightning Network is making waves. What is Amboss Rails and How Does it Offer Bitcoin Yield? Amboss, a well-known name in the Lightning Network ecosystem for analytics and node management, has launched a service called Rails. This innovative platform is designed to allow users to earn Bitcoin Yield directly on the Lightning Network. Unlike some other yield-generating methods, Rails operates on a self-custodial basis, meaning you retain control of your private keys and your Bitcoin throughout the process. Rails achieves this by facilitating two primary activities on the Lightning Network: Payment Routing: By running a Lightning node connected to Rails, users can earn small fees by routing payments across the network. When someone sends a Lightning payment, it travels through a series of nodes. Your node can earn a small fraction of the transaction fee for participating in the route. Liquidity Leasing: The Lightning Network relies on ‘channels’ filled with liquidity (Bitcoin) to route payments. Rails allows users to lease out their channel liquidity to other nodes or businesses that need it. In return for providing this crucial liquidity, users can earn yield. This dual approach leverages the fundamental mechanics of the Lightning Network to create earning opportunities directly tied to network activity and infrastructure needs. Boosting Lightning Network Activity Through Amboss Rails One of the key goals behind Amboss Rails is not just to offer users a way to generate Passive Bitcoin Income , but also to significantly boost the overall health and liquidity of the Lightning Network itself. A more liquid network is a more efficient and reliable network for payments. Think of it like a road network. The more well-maintained roads with sufficient capacity there are, the smoother traffic flows. Similarly, the more liquidity available in Lightning channels, the easier and more reliable it is for users to send and receive payments quickly and cheaply. By incentivizing users to provide liquidity and run well-connected nodes through yield generation, Rails directly contributes to making the Lightning Network a more robust and attractive platform for everyday transactions. This could play a crucial role in driving wider adoption of Bitcoin for payments. Who Can Benefit from Amboss Rails and Crypto Earning? Amboss Rails is designed with a variety of users in mind, particularly those who are serious about participating in and benefiting from the growth of the Lightning Network . The platform is targeting both institutions and businesses, recognizing their potential to contribute significant liquidity and benefit from reliable Crypto Earning opportunities. Early partners like CoinCorner, a prominent Bitcoin exchange, and Flux, a decentralized infrastructure provider, are already integrating with Rails. This indicates interest from established players in leveraging the service for their operations and potentially offering it to their users. While the service is sophisticated and likely requires some technical understanding to set up and manage a Lightning node effectively, the concept of earning Passive Bitcoin Income without handing over custody is appealing to a broad range of Bitcoin holders, from individuals with larger holdings to companies looking to optimize their treasury assets. Understanding the Mechanics: Payment Routing and Liquidity Leasing To truly grasp how Amboss Rails enables Bitcoin Yield , let’s look a bit closer at the two core mechanisms: Payment Routing: When a Lightning payment is initiated, the network finds a path of connected nodes with open channels and sufficient balance to route the payment. Nodes along the path earn a small fee (routing fee) for forwarding the payment. The amount earned depends on the volume of payments routed and the fees the node charges (which can be adjusted). Liquidity Leasing: Nodes or businesses needing more capacity in their channels to send or receive larger payments can ‘lease’ liquidity. Through Rails, users can offer their channel capacity for lease. The leasing terms (duration, yield rate) are agreed upon, and the provider earns yield for the period the liquidity is locked in the leased channel. Both methods are integral to the functioning of the Lightning Network and provide legitimate ways to earn a return based on providing essential network services. Challenges and Considerations for Earning Passive Bitcoin Income While the prospect of generating Passive Bitcoin Income through Amboss Rails is exciting, it’s important to be aware of potential challenges and considerations: Technical Complexity: Running a reliable Lightning node and managing channels effectively requires technical knowledge. Users need to understand channel management, balancing, and maintaining uptime. Variable Yield: The amount of Bitcoin Yield earned through routing fees can fluctuate significantly based on network activity and payment volume. Liquidity leasing might offer more predictable returns but depends on demand for liquidity. Capital Requirements: Earning meaningful yield typically requires dedicating a reasonable amount of Bitcoin to channels for routing and leasing. Channel Management: Actively managing channels, opening and closing them strategically, and ensuring they are well-connected is crucial for maximizing earning potential. Rails aims to simplify some aspects of this, particularly on the leasing side, but users should still approach it with a clear understanding of how the Lightning Network operates. The Future of Bitcoin Yield and the Lightning Network Amboss Rails represents a significant step forward in making Bitcoin Yield accessible on the Lightning Network in a self-custodial manner. By creating incentives for users to provide essential network services like routing and liquidity, it not only offers earning potential but also directly contributes to the network’s growth and efficiency. As the Lightning Network continues to mature and adoption increases, services like Rails could become increasingly popular, providing a virtuous cycle where earning opportunities grow alongside network usage. This could solidify the Lightning Network’s position as the premier layer-2 solution for fast, cheap Bitcoin transactions. For anyone interested in earning yield on their Bitcoin while supporting decentralized network infrastructure, exploring Amboss Rails and understanding the mechanics of Crypto Earning on the Lightning Network is a compelling prospect. Summary: Amboss Rails Opens New Doors for Bitcoin Earning In conclusion, Amboss has launched Rails, a self-custodial service enabling users to earn Bitcoin Yield on the Lightning Network . Through payment routing and liquidity leasing, Rails offers a novel way to generate Passive Bitcoin Income while maintaining control of your assets. Targeting businesses and institutions initially, with partners like CoinCorner and Flux on board, the platform aims to boost Lightning Network liquidity and adoption. While requiring some technical engagement, it presents a significant opportunity for those looking to participate in the network’s growth and benefit from Crypto Earning directly on layer 2.

2025-05-30T06:59:07.000Z,"Fed Chair Tells Trump That Monetary Policy Is Based on ‘Non-Political Analysis’ After Wave of Criticism From the President","U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell met with President Donald Trump following the White House’s broadsides against the Fed’s monetary policy choices. The Fed, however, noted in a statement following the meeting that Powell did not discuss interest rate expectations with the president. “At the President’s invitation, Chair Powell met with the President today at the White House to discuss economic developments including for growth, employment, and inflation. Chair Powell did not discuss his expectations for monetary policy, except to stress that the path of policy will depend entirely on incoming economic information and what that means for the outlook. Finally, Chair Powell said that he and his colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will set monetary policy, as required by law, to support maximum employment and stable prices and will make those decisions based solely on careful, objective, and non-political analysis.” Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell for not slashing interest rates, saying earlier this month that communicating with the Fed chair is “like talking to a wall.” “The Bank of England cut. China cut. Everybody’s cutting but him. I don’t know, we’ll see what happens. It’s a shame. I call him ‘Too Late.’ Too Late Powell, that’s his nickname. And it’s a shame, it’s ridiculous… he’s always too late.

On Wednesday, the United States Court of International Trade (CIT) ruled that many of Donald Trump’s tariffs exceed the authority granted to the president by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The federal court struck down Trump’s April 2nd executive order establishing tariffs against 57 countries worldwide and several follow-up executive orders modifying the duties’ rates and start dates. The CIT also axed a slew of earlier tariffs Trump had applied to Mexico, Canada and China, which he claimed were retaliation for failing to stop the flood of illegal narcotics into the US. The Trump Administration immediately appealed the CIT’s ruling and requested a stay on the judgment, which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit granted . White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt blasted the CIT’s ruling on Thursday, arguing that Trump’s “sensitive diplomatic and trade negotiations” were being “derailed by activist judges.” Equities largely tracked sideways throughout the legal drama, with the S&P 500 ticking up 0.4% on Thursday and the Nasdaq Composite jumping by 0.39%.

2025-05-30T06:50:40.000Z,"PSG Bitcoin Reserve: French Football Giant Makes Bold Crypto Move","BitcoinWorld PSG Bitcoin Reserve: French Football Giant Makes Bold Crypto Move The world of professional sports just got a significant jolt from the world of digital assets. French football powerhouse Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) has reportedly made a groundbreaking move, establishing a PSG Bitcoin Reserve . This development, initially reported by BeInCrypto, positions the Ligue 1 champions at the forefront of integrating cryptocurrency into traditional institutional finance within the sports sector. While many sports teams and leagues have dipped their toes into the crypto space through fan tokens, sponsorships, or NFTs, PSG’s reported decision to hold Bitcoin directly on its balance sheet is a distinct and potentially transformative step. It signals a level of confidence in Bitcoin as a store of value and a strategic asset. What Exactly is a Sports Team Bitcoin Reserve? In traditional finance, companies and institutions often hold reserves in various assets, primarily fiat currency, but also potentially in gold, real estate, or other stable investments, to manage liquidity, hedge against inflation, or diversify their holdings. A Sports Team Bitcoin reserve means the club is choosing to allocate a portion of its treasury funds directly into Bitcoin. This differs significantly from other crypto activities we’ve seen in sports: Fan Tokens: These are cryptocurrencies specifically for fans, offering voting rights, rewards, and access to exclusive content. They are primarily a fan engagement and revenue-generating tool, not a treasury management strategy. Sponsorships: Crypto exchanges or projects sponsoring teams provides marketing for the crypto entity and revenue for the team, but the team doesn’t necessarily hold the sponsored cryptocurrency. NFTs: Non-fungible tokens representing digital collectibles are another revenue stream and fan engagement method, not a direct investment in a core cryptocurrency like Bitcoin for treasury purposes. By establishing a PSG Bitcoin Reserve , the club is making an investment decision about its own corporate treasury, similar to how some major corporations have started holding Bitcoin. Why Would a Football Club Embrace Institutional Bitcoin Adoption? PSG’s move into holding Institutional Bitcoin is likely driven by several strategic considerations: 1. Inflation Hedge: Like many corporations exploring Bitcoin, PSG may view BTC as a potential hedge against inflation and the devaluation of traditional fiat currencies. Holding a scarce digital asset could preserve purchasing power over the long term. 2. Asset Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to their treasury diversifies their holdings beyond traditional financial instruments, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk (though introducing crypto-specific volatility). 3. Innovation and Brand Image: Aligning with cutting-edge technology like Bitcoin can enhance PSG’s brand image as innovative and forward-thinking. This resonates with a younger, globally connected, and tech-savvy fanbase. 4. Potential for Appreciation: While volatile, Bitcoin has shown significant long-term appreciation potential. A successful investment could directly benefit the club’s financial health. 5. Attracting a Global Digital Audience: Embracing Bitcoin connects PSG with the vast and growing global cryptocurrency community, potentially attracting new fans and commercial opportunities in digital markets. This step into Institutional Bitcoin by a major football club is a powerful signal to the market and other traditional institutions. Is PSG Truly the First Crypto Sports Pioneer in This Way? The claim that PSG is the first sports organization to introduce a Bitcoin reserve needs careful consideration. While many sports entities are involved with crypto, holding Bitcoin directly on the balance sheet for treasury purposes is indeed less common than fan tokens or sponsorships. Major corporations like MicroStrategy and Tesla famously added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, pioneering the ‘corporate treasury’ use case. PSG appears to be the first major professional sports *team* to publicly announce such a move specifically for Bitcoin reserves. Other sports entities might have exposure to crypto through investments in blockchain companies or receiving payments in crypto, but a dedicated ‘Bitcoin reserve’ signals a deliberate strategy to hold BTC as a primary treasury asset. This distinction is crucial and positions PSG as a notable pioneer in the intersection of Crypto Sports and corporate finance. Benefits and Challenges of a Football Club Crypto Strategy Adopting a Football Club Crypto strategy, particularly one involving holding volatile assets like Bitcoin, comes with potential rewards and significant risks. Potential Benefits: Financial Upside: If Bitcoin appreciates, the value of the reserve increases, boosting the club’s assets. Enhanced Reputation: Seen as innovative and aligned with future technology trends. New Revenue Streams: Opens doors for crypto-related partnerships and fan engagement initiatives. Global Reach: Connects with the worldwide crypto community. Potential Challenges and Risks: Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can fluctuate dramatically, potentially leading to significant paper losses on the reserve. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Security Risks: Holding significant amounts of crypto requires robust security measures against hacking and theft. Public Perception: Fluctuations in the reserve’s value could attract negative media attention or fan scrutiny. Accounting Complexity: Accounting for cryptocurrency holdings can be complex under current standards. Any Football Club Crypto strategy involving treasury reserves requires careful risk management and a long-term perspective. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Sports ? PSG’s reported move could be a watershed moment for Crypto Sports integration. If successful, it could inspire other major sports clubs and organizations across football, basketball, baseball, and other leagues to explore similar strategies. We might see a trend where: More teams consider holding Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as part of their treasury management. Crypto assets become more integrated into sports finance beyond just marketing and fan engagement. Competition increases among teams to be seen as technologically advanced and appealing to the digital generation. New financial products and services emerge specifically for sports organizations dealing with crypto. This development underscores the increasing convergence of the traditional financial world, institutional investment, and the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market, now reaching into the mainstream world of global sports. Actionable Insights for Fans and Investors For fans, this news highlights PSG’s commitment to innovation and potentially offers new ways to engage with the club in the future, perhaps through crypto-enabled platforms or services tied to the club’s digital strategy. For crypto investors, PSG’s move is another data point indicating growing institutional adoption of Bitcoin. While one team’s investment is not a guarantee of future price movements, it adds to the narrative of Bitcoin gaining acceptance as a legitimate asset class among diverse institutions. It’s a reminder that the integration of crypto into mainstream sectors is accelerating, creating both opportunities and the need for continued education and careful consideration of risks. A Bold Step into the Digital Future Paris Saint-Germain’s reported establishment of a PSG Bitcoin Reserve marks a bold and significant step. As potentially the first major sports team to directly hold Bitcoin as a treasury asset, they are navigating uncharted territory within the sports industry. This move reflects a growing confidence in Bitcoin among institutions and signals a potential shift in how major sports organizations manage their finances and engage with the digital economy. While challenges exist, the potential benefits in terms of diversification, inflation hedging, and brand innovation are clear. The world will be watching to see if other clubs follow PSG’s lead, further solidifying the link between Crypto Sports and the future of finance.

2025-05-30T06:50:19.000Z,"Urgent Showdown: Trump Pushes Fed Interest Rates Down, Powell Defends Independence","BitcoinWorld Urgent Showdown: Trump Pushes Fed Interest Rates Down, Powell Defends Independence For anyone navigating the dynamic world of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies, understanding the pulse of global economic policy is absolutely crucial. Why? Because decisions made in boardrooms like the Federal Reserve can send ripples that significantly influence the volatility and direction of the crypto market impact . A recent meeting between former President Donald Trump and current Fed Chair Jerome Powell brought this connection into sharp focus, highlighting the ongoing tension between political desires and central bank autonomy regarding Fed interest rates . The Meeting: Trump’s Call vs. Powell’s Stance on Fed Interest Rates On May 29, U.S. President Donald Trump met with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell . The core of Trump’s message was clear: he urged the Fed to cut Fed interest rates . His rationale, as reported by Yonhap News Agency, centered on the need for the U.S. to remain globally competitive. Lower interest rates can potentially weaken a nation’s currency, making its exports cheaper and potentially stimulating economic activity. However, Chair Powell’s response was equally firm. He reiterated the Federal Reserve’s long-standing commitment to making decisions based purely on economic data and without political influence. This principle of Fed independence is considered vital for maintaining stability and credibility in monetary policy. The Fed’s dual mandate is typically focused on maximizing employment and stabilizing prices (controlling inflation), not necessarily global competitiveness based on currency strength. Understanding Monetary Policy and Why it Matters to Crypto At its heart, monetary policy refers to the actions undertaken by a central bank, like the U.S. Federal Reserve, to manipulate the money supply and credit conditions to stimulate or constrain economic activity. The primary tool for this is often setting a target range for the federal funds rate – the interest rate banks charge each other for overnight lending. This rate influences borrowing costs throughout the economy, from mortgages and car loans to business investments. Here’s a simple breakdown of how monetary policy typically works and its potential effects: Lowering Interest Rates: This makes borrowing cheaper. Businesses might invest more, consumers might spend more (e.g., on homes or cars). This stimulates economic growth but can also lead to inflation if the economy overheats. It can also make traditional, low-yield investments less attractive. Raising Interest Rates: This makes borrowing more expensive. Businesses and consumers may reduce spending and investment. This slows down economic growth, helping to cool inflation. It can make traditional, safer investments (like bonds or savings accounts) more appealing due to higher yields. So, where does crypto fit in? Cryptocurrencies are often considered risk assets. When traditional investment yields are low (due to low interest rates), investors might look for higher returns in alternative markets, including crypto. Conversely, when interest rates rise, safer investments offer better returns, potentially drawing capital away from more speculative assets like Bitcoin and altcoins. This is the core of the crypto market impact from Fed decisions. The Current Stance: Holding Rates Despite Pressure Despite the pressure from Donald Trump and others who advocate for lower borrowing costs, the Federal Reserve under Jerome Powell has maintained a steady course. Since the start of Trump’s second term (assuming this refers to a hypothetical second term scenario or perhaps reflects a general sentiment during his presidency/post-presidency), the Fed has held rates within a specific range. The snippet mentions 4.25–4.50%, which aligns with rate levels seen in recent years as the Fed has worked to combat inflation that surged after the pandemic. This decision to hold rates reflects the Fed’s assessment of current economic conditions, particularly regarding inflation and employment. They are using data to guide their path, prioritizing price stability even in the face of political commentary or calls for growth stimulation via cheaper money. How Does This Tension Affect the Crypto Market? The dynamic between political pressure and Fed independence creates uncertainty, which the crypto market often reacts to. Here’s how this tension, specifically around Fed interest rates and monetary policy , can influence crypto: Uncertainty Breeds Volatility: Any hint of a shift in Fed policy, whether influenced by politics or data, can lead to significant price swings in crypto. Traders and investors constantly try to anticipate the Fed’s next move. Risk-On vs. Risk-Off Sentiment: If markets perceive that political pressure might lead to lower rates (more stimulative monetary policy ), it can foster a ‘risk-on’ environment where investors are more willing to buy assets like crypto. Conversely, if the Fed remains hawkish (focused on fighting inflation with higher rates), it supports a ‘risk-off’ sentiment, potentially leading to outflows from crypto. Dollar Strength: Higher U.S. interest rates typically strengthen the U.S. dollar, as foreign investors are attracted to higher yields on dollar-denominated assets. A stronger dollar can sometimes correlate with weaker performance in global commodities and potentially alternative assets like crypto, though this relationship is complex and not always direct. Inflation Hedges: Some view Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation. If expansionary monetary policy (like significant rate cuts or money printing) is anticipated, the narrative around Bitcoin as a hedge against currency debasement can gain traction, potentially boosting its price. The fact that Donald Trump is vocal about his preference for lower rates keeps the possibility of political influence on the table, even if Jerome Powell consistently pushes back. This ongoing dialogue contributes to the complex set of factors influencing investor sentiment and, consequently, the crypto market impact . What Are the Challenges and Actionable Insights for Crypto Holders? The primary challenge for crypto investors stemming from this situation is navigating the uncertainty. Predicting the Fed’s exact moves is difficult, and predicting the extent to which political pressure might *eventually* have an effect is even harder. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Pay close attention to official Federal Reserve announcements, meeting minutes, and speeches by Chair Powell and other governors. These provide direct insight into their data-driven approach and future intentions. Monitor Economic Data: Keep an eye on key economic indicators the Fed watches, such as inflation rates (CPI, PCE), employment figures (non-farm payrolls, unemployment rate), and GDP growth. These data points are what truly drive the Fed’s decisions, according to Powell. Understand the Correlation, But Don’t Assume Causation: While there’s a historical correlation between interest rates/monetary policy and crypto market movements, it’s not the only factor. Regulatory news, technological developments, institutional adoption, and global events also play significant roles. Develop a Long-Term Strategy: Relying solely on predicting Fed moves for short-term trading is risky. A well-researched, long-term investment strategy based on the fundamentals of the crypto projects you believe in is often more robust against macro-economic volatility. Consider Diversification: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversifying across different asset classes can help mitigate risks associated with specific market sensitivities, like crypto’s reaction to monetary policy shifts. In Summary: The Ongoing Tug-of-War The meeting between Donald Trump and Jerome Powell serves as a potent reminder of the inherent tension between political goals and the independent mandate of the central bank. While a president may advocate for policies they believe will benefit the economy (like lower Fed interest rates for global competitiveness), the Federal Reserve maintains that its decisions are based on rigorous data analysis aimed at achieving stable prices and maximum employment. This ongoing dialogue, and the market’s reaction to the perceived likelihood of rate changes influenced by either data or pressure, has a tangible crypto market impact . For those invested in digital assets, understanding this complex interplay of monetary policy , political commentary, and economic data is not just academic – it’s a vital part of navigating the market landscape effectively.

2025-05-30T06:40:48.000Z,"FTX Collapse: Netflix Unveils Shocking Series on SBF Scandal","BitcoinWorld FTX Collapse: Netflix Unveils Shocking Series on SBF Scandal Get ready to dive deep into one of the most talked-about events in recent financial history. Netflix, the streaming giant known for bringing complex stories to the screen, is tackling the FTX collapse . That’s right, the dramatic downfall of Sam Bankman-Fried’s cryptocurrency exchange is set to become an eight-part series, promising to peel back the layers on the events that sent shockwaves through the crypto world and beyond. What is the Netflix FTX Series “The Altruists”? According to reports, Netflix is developing an eight-part series focusing on the dramatic implosion of FTX. The working title for the series is reportedly “The Altruists.” This title itself hints at the complex and often contradictory public image cultivated by FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who frequently spoke about effective altruism while allegedly orchestrating massive financial misconduct. The series aims to chronicle the story of FTX, its meteoric rise, and its stunning collapse in November 2022. It will likely place a significant focus on the key figures involved, particularly: Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF): The founder and former CEO of FTX, known for his distinctive look, media presence, and political donations. Caroline Ellison: The former CEO of Alameda Research, FTX’s affiliated trading firm, whose testimony played a crucial role in subsequent legal proceedings. The series is being produced by Higher Ground, the production company founded by former U.S. President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama. This involvement suggests a focus on the broader societal and ethical implications of the collapse, not just the financial details. It indicates the series aims for a wide audience, explaining the complexities of crypto and the scandal in an accessible way. The choice of an eight-part format suggests a comprehensive approach, allowing the series to explore different facets of the story, from the early days of FTX and Alameda to the frantic days leading up to the bankruptcy filing and the aftermath. Deep Dive: The Devastating FTX Collapse The FTX collapse wasn’t just a company going bankrupt; it was a spectacular implosion that wiped out billions in customer funds and severely damaged trust in the cryptocurrency industry. Understanding the context is crucial for appreciating the significance of the Netflix series. FTX, at its peak, was one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, valued at an estimated $32 billion. Sam Bankman-Fried was hailed as a crypto prodigy, a responsible figure bringing legitimacy to the volatile world of digital assets. However, underneath the polished exterior, serious issues were allegedly brewing, primarily involving the relationship between FTX and Alameda Research. Here’s a simplified look at some key aspects the series will likely explore: The Intertwined Relationship: Alameda Research, also founded by SBF, was a hedge fund. Allegations center on Alameda receiving preferential treatment on FTX, including a massive, effectively unlimited line of credit, allowing it to trade with customer funds deposited on the exchange. Misuse of Customer Funds: Prosecutors alleged that billions of dollars in customer funds deposited on FTX were secretly diverted to Alameda to cover its trading losses, make investments, and fund lavish lifestyles and political donations. The Bank Run: The crisis escalated rapidly in early November 2022 following reports raising concerns about Alameda’s balance sheet and its reliance on FTX’s native token, FTT. This triggered a massive wave of customer withdrawals from FTX that the exchange could not fulfill, exposing the lack of reserves. Bankruptcy: Within days, FTX, Alameda, and dozens of affiliated companies filed for bankruptcy in the U.S., leaving millions of customers unable to access their funds. The speed and scale of the collapse were unprecedented for such a major financial institution, leaving regulators, investors, and the public stunned. It highlighted significant risks within the crypto ecosystem, particularly concerning transparency, corporate governance, and the commingling of funds. Key Players: Sam Bankman-Fried and Caroline Ellison At the heart of the FTX scandal are Sam Bankman-Fried and Caroline Ellison. Their relationship, both personal and professional, is central to the narrative. Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF): SBF cultivated an image as a quirky, ethical billionaire, often seen in shorts and a t-shirt, promoting effective altruism and responsible crypto regulation. He testified before Congress and became a prominent voice in the industry. However, prosecutors painted a different picture: that of a calculating individual who defrauded customers and investors on a massive scale. His trial captivated the public, culminating in his conviction on multiple counts of fraud and conspiracy. Caroline Ellison: Ellison was the CEO of Alameda Research. Her role is particularly significant because she was privy to the inner workings of Alameda’s finances and its relationship with FTX. After the collapse, she pleaded guilty to fraud charges and became a key cooperating witness for the government in the case against SBF. Her candid testimony provided crucial insights into the alleged fraudulent activities and the decision-making processes within the two companies. The dynamic between these two figures, their shared history at Jane Street, their cohabitation in the Bahamas, and their differing roles in the alleged scheme, offer fertile ground for dramatic storytelling. The Netflix series will likely explore their motivations, their decisions, and the pressures they faced as their financial empire crumbled. Why a Series on the FTX Scandal Matters Why dedicate an eight-part series to the FTX scandal ? Because it’s more than just a business failure; it’s a story packed with universal themes: Ambition and Hubris: The rapid rise and fall of SBF and FTX exemplify the dangers of unchecked ambition and overconfidence. Ethics and Deception: The core allegations involve a massive betrayal of trust and a stark contrast between public image and private actions. The Complexity of Finance: The series can help demystify some aspects of cryptocurrency and complex financial structures for a general audience, illustrating the risks involved. Regulatory Challenges: The collapse highlighted the urgent need for clearer regulation in the crypto space, a topic of ongoing global debate. Human Impact: Millions of individuals lost significant savings in the collapse. The series has the potential to tell these human stories. For those interested in crypto, finance, or simply compelling narratives of power and downfall, the FTX story is a modern cautionary tale. A high-profile series like this can bring mainstream attention to the risks and complexities of the digital asset world, potentially educating viewers about the importance of due diligence and regulatory oversight. Beyond the Headlines: What Other Crypto Documentaries Should You Watch? While we await the Netflix FTX series , there are other valuable crypto documentaries and series that explore different facets of this fascinating and volatile industry. If you’re hooked on understanding the world of digital assets, consider checking out: Here are a few examples: Title Focus Potential Themes Covered Banking on Bitcoin The origins and early days of Bitcoin and the technology behind it. Creation of Bitcoin, early adopters, blockchain tech, ideological roots. Crypto A fictional thriller touching on the dark side of cryptocurrency money laundering. Crime, regulation, anonymity vs. transparency. (Note: Fictional) Line Goes Up – The Problem With NFTs A critical look at the NFT market. NFTs, digital art, speculation, environmental impact, scams. Trust No One: The Hunt for the Crypto King Focuses on the QuadrigaCX exchange collapse and the mysterious death of its founder. Exchange risks, founder control, security, investigation.

The FTX series will add another critical piece to this growing body of content attempting to make sense of the crypto revolution. Anticipating “The Altruists” The announcement of the Netflix series “The Altruists” is a significant moment. It signals that the story of the FTX collapse has transcended the financial news cycle and entered the realm of major cultural narratives. With Higher Ground producing, there’s an expectation of a thoughtful and engaging exploration of the events, the individuals involved, and the broader implications. For many, the series will be a chance to understand how such a massive alleged fraud could occur in plain sight. For those affected by the collapse, it might be a difficult but necessary recounting of events. And for the crypto industry, it serves as a stark reminder of the need for transparency, robust regulation, and ethical leadership. As production moves forward, more details about the cast, specific focus areas, and release date will emerge. But one thing is clear: the story of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, and Caroline Ellison is coming to a major streaming platform, ensuring that this pivotal moment in financial history will be examined by a global audience. The Netflix FTX series isn’t just entertainment; it’s a potential educational tool and a historical document chronicling a defining event for the digital asset world. Conclusion: The Curtain Rises on the FTX Saga The news that Netflix is producing an eight-part series titled “The Altruists” on the FTX collapse confirms the immense impact and enduring fascination surrounding this event. Focusing on figures like Sam Bankman-Fried and Caroline Ellison, and produced by Higher Ground, the series is poised to offer a comprehensive look at the rise and spectacular fall of a crypto empire. It will likely explore the complex interplay of ambition, innovation, alleged deception, and the human cost of one of the largest financial frauds in history.

2025-05-30T06:30:05.000Z,"This Chart Warns Bitcoin’s Momentum May Be Running Out, Here’s Why","Bitcoin is currently trading above $107,000 following a recent peak that saw the asset touch a new all-time high above $111,000. Although this marks a 3.9% drop from its highest level, the broader monthly trend remains positive, with BTC still recording a gain of over 10% in the last 30 days. The market, however, has shifted its attention from price movement to on-chain dynamics, particularly the behavior of new and long-term holders. Related Reading: Bitcoin Surges With Low Retail Interest – Is A Second Wave Coming? Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Selling, New Entrants Still Cautious On-chain analyst Avocado Onchain, writing on CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, examined Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) data to assess investor trends during this stage of the cycle. In a post titled “UTXO Age Band Analysis: Sluggish Inflow of New Investors May Limit Bitcoin’s Upside,” he explored whether BTC’s continued rally can be sustained without fresh capital inflows from newer market participants. His findings suggest that while older coins are being sold, the inflow of newer investors remains low, a factor that has historically limited momentum in previous cycles. The UTXO age distribution reveals that a significant portion of the BTC supply remains with holders who have kept their assets for over six months. The 6–12 month age band has increased, suggesting a large share of market participants still fall into the mid- to long-term holding category. Historically, when the proportion of these holders started to shrink, it often preceded major tops in Bitcoin’s price cycle, driven by a transition of coins from long-term to new investors. However, despite Bitcoin reaching new highs, the percentage of UTXOs held by investors with a holding period of less than one month remains well below the historical threshold seen near previous market tops. During earlier bull cycles, new investor participation often surged past 50%. Currently, that figure sits around 20%, even lower than the peak levels during this recent rally. Avocado Onchain warns that without a notable increase in participation from newer investors, the market may struggle to maintain upward momentum. Large Holders Accumulate as Retail Stays on Sidelines While retail inflows appear to be lacking, large-scale accumulation is continuing in the background. A recent update from CryptoQuant on X highlighted that Bitcoin addresses holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC, excluding exchanges and miners, have been steadily increasing.

2025-05-30T06:30:00.000Z,"Crypto market crash: is this the end of the bull run?","The crypto market has pulled back in the past few days. After soaring to a record high of $111,900 last week, Bitcoin price fell to $106,000 as investors booked profits. Bullish liquidations have risen, and demand for most altcoins has fallen. This article explains why the crash has happened and whether this is the end of the bull run. Why the crypto market crash has happened The crypto market crash has happened because of profit-taking among investors. Besides, Bitcoin price was up by 50% from its lowest level in April to its highest swing this month. It is common for Bitcoin and other assets to pull back after rising to a crucial resistance level. There are many examples about this. For example, BTC price jumped to a record high of $64,750 in April 2021 and then dived to $28,685 in June 2021. It then soared to a new all-time high of $69,255 in November 2021 and to below $20,000 in 2022. Most recently, Bitcoin peaked at $73,783 in March last year and then dropped below $50,000 in August. These pullbacks normally happens as investors book profits and prepare for the next big move. Technically, the crypto market crash is happening as Bitcoin forms the handle section of the cup-and-handle pattern. C&H is a pattern comprised of a rounded bottom, a horizontal support, and a shoulder. The shoulder can happen for a few days or months, and it often results into a strong bullish breakout. Altcoins are falling because of their close correlation with Bitcoin. When Bitcoin sneezes, the rest of the crypto market catches a cold. In most cases, if Bitcoin falls by 1%, many altcoins will fall by over 5%. Bitcoin price cup and handle pattern | Source: TradingView Trade concerns and the Fed The crypto market crash has also happened as concerns about trade and the Federal Reserve have remained. A US court ended Donald Trump’s tariffs this week, but another one left them in place for the time being. These tariffs will remain in place until the case concludes at the Supreme Court. Also, it is worth noting that Trump has other ways to implement tariffs even if the current ones fail. The crypto market crash happened after Scott Bessent said that China talks had stalled , and that it would now take a meeting between Xi Jinping and Donald Trump to resolve the deadlock. There are also concerns that the Federal Reserve will maintain high interest rates for longer as inflation concerns remain. Is the crypto bull run over? Therefore, a common question among most participants in the crypto market is whether the bull market is now over. We believe that the crypto bull run is still going on because of Bitcoin’s supply and demand dynamics. Bitcoin demand continues rising, with spot ETFs having cumulative inflows of over $45 billion. At the same time, Bitcoin supply in exchanges has dropped from over 3 million in 2020 to 1.3 million today. The rest of the Bitcoins are held in cold wallets. Also, as mentioned above, Bitcoin has formed a cup-and-handle pattern, meaning that it will soon have a bullish breakout. If this happens, there is a likelihood that other altcoins will rebound. The caveat is that the ongoing price action could stay for a while as we enter the summer months. Historically, June is usually Bitcoin’s worst month. Therefore, the consolidation could remain for a while ahead of the eventual rebound.

The FTX’s long-awaited creditor repayment program seems to have kept the traders on edge. A $5 billion stablecoin payout could be good news for those who were waiting to recover the funds, but the market could be more focused on where the money could go While the stablecoin flows in and out of the exchange have dropped as the exchange reserves deplete, the top tokens like Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Cardano seem to have been facing some potential selling pressure. Once the recipients receive their portion, the stablecoin reserves on CEX are expected to increase, which could flood the market, increasing the trading activity within the space. Now the question arises, will Bitcoin or Ethereum benefit from this move? After marking new highs during the past week, the Bitcoin price has initiated the weekly trade on a bearish note. The token is on the verge of losing below the pivotal support zone, while Ethereum displays strength as it sustains firmly above $2600, maintaining consecutive higher highs and lows. Besides, XRP & ADA continue to trade below the descending trend line, while memecoins are plunging with a double-digit margin. The payout is one of the largest in crypto history, as the creditors are set to receive funds after 18 months of the exchange’s collapse. Hence, this is expected to hit the exchanges first, which could increase the stablecoin exchange reserve. While some may exit the space, some are believed to get swapped for the other cryptos, Bitcoin being one of the popular choices. Hence, Bitcoin is expected to receive some liquidity that may push the price slightly higher. With this, the other cryptos could also experience a similar price rise that could help the markets remain under bullish influence.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/massive-liquidity-set-to-enter-crypto-markets-for-the-first-time-ever-will-this-benefit-bitcoins-price/,"BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-05-30T06:04:49.000Z,"Crypto Holders Sit in Massive Gains as Percent of Supply in Profit Soars","An on-chain indicator is clearly showing the current sentiment for the major cryptos : most holders are sitting on unrealized profits. The “Percent of Total Supply in Profit” metric tracks how much of a cryptocurrency’s circulating supply was acquired at a price lower than its current market value. Right now, it seems that a lot of top coins are seeing a historically high amount of profit among their holders. Here are the figures for some of the major coins: Bitcoin (BTC): 73.1% Ethereum (ETH): 79.6% Litecoin (LTC): 83.5% Chainlink (LINK): 92.3% Ripple (XRP): 90.5% Polkadot (DOT): 91.5% Cardano (ADA): 87.9% Solana (SOL): 95.4% The figures for Chainlink, Ripple and Solana are especially impressive. The data indicates that the market has experienced widespread increases in the prices of assets, from Bitcoin and Ethereum to altcoins like XRP and Dogecoin. This could be seen as a sign that the market is quite strong. But it could also mean that the market in general is due for a correction, as people might be tempted to take profits after the long, nearly uninterrupted upward trend we’ve seen. Bitcoin, XRP Lead the Pack in Holder Profits New data shows that Bitcoin has the highest amount of its supply in profit. Currently, 98.4% of circulating Bitcoin is worth more than it was worth when it was acquired. This reflects the long-term bullishness of Bitcoin. It also reflects the conviction held by many who hold Bitcoin. XRP is closely behind with 98.3 percent of its supply in favorable territory for holders. This is a surprising figure given all the regulatory and legal trouble XRP has faced, including a lawsuit from the SEC. XRP is now almost completely in profitable territory thanks to its recent price recovery. Pretty much all XRP holders are now making money, which confirms that the market has pretty much shaken off the earlier uncertainty it had with regard to this token. Other significant assets are likewise registering stout profit rates. Chainlink counts 80.5 percent of its supply in profit; Dogecoin, 77.9 percent; Ethereum, 71.5 percent; and Cardano, 71.0 percent. Not on par with Bitcoin or XRP, these numbers nonetheless suggest a large swath of token holders in these networks is seeing returns on its investments. Percent of Total Supply in Profit is a straightforward metric that shows how much of a cryptocurrency’s current circulating supply is held at a profit—meaning the coins were bought at a lower price than they’re worth today. Currently, some notable top caps' supply in profit… pic.twitter.com/QU3sGrtV07 — Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 28, 2025 What This Metric Tells Us About Market Sentiment The Percent of Supply in Profit is a metric that is simple and direct. A token is either in profit or it isn’t, with the profit margin being minimal for some. This offers a simple yet effective way of viewing how positioned in the market investors are. Of course, when large amounts of a coin’s supply are in profit, it more often than not indicates that the price has been moving in a positive direction recently and that the holders themselves are exhibiting bullish sentiment. Yet this trend can also signal something more ominous. When a token becomes overbought—as indicated by the variety of signals described above—its price is probably at or near an unsustainable peak. Although this peak may persist for a time, it will inevitably be followed by a cooldown phase. Since this is the typical life cycle of overbought tokens, these sorts of price trends represent the kind of living danger signs that traders should be wary of. Conversely, when most of a coin’s supply is losing money, this usually signals that the market is awash with pessimism and fear. Historically, these moments of low sentiment have often coincided with buying opportunities. They tend to mark the moments when a coin is way undervalued and is just about to recover in price. To gain a better overall understanding, this metric is frequently examined together with other ones such as the Market Value to Realized Value ratio (MVRV), the Relative Strength Index (RSI), and the Network Realized Profit/Loss. When looked at together, they offer insight into whether or not the market is in an overbought or oversold condition, or somewhere in the middle. Rising Profits: Opportunity or Warning? With the continual evolution of cryptocurrencies and the emergence of new coins, it’s anticipated that an increasing portion of the supply of individual assets will be held in profit. But looking at percentages instead of actual numbers gives us a clearer, inflation-adjusted picture of the current market. This allows us to reach conclusions that aren’t misled by simple volume comparisons. At present, the profits being made by the holders of Bitcoin, XRP, and other major coins are nearly universal. That is an unambiguous thumbs-up for the kind of upward momentum we like to see. And yet, it also makes us think about being cautious. At least, it should make us think about being cautious because crypto’s cyclical nature means that periods of high profitability often lead to market resets—consolidations or corrections. The percentage of supply in profit isn’t predictive by itself, but combined with larger market analysis, it becomes a pretty nifty gauge of investor sentiment. Whether this current round of nice moves turns out to be the prelude to sustained new highs or just the thing that kicks off the next wave of profit-taking, the fact is that right now the entire crypto market is in a nice phase, and everyone is watching to see what happens next.

This ascent represents a rise of $25.8 billion from the recent lows and highlights a developing demand among traders and investors for the more refined vehicles that serve to hedge risk and implement relatively advanced trading strategies. The open interest in options has been increasing much more rapidly than that in futures, a sign of the evolving nature of the Bitcoin derivatives market. $BTC options open interest recently hit an all-time high of $46.2B – up +$25.8B from the lows. This sharp growth outpaces futures and signals rising demand for more advanced hedging and strategy execution as market participants grow more sophisticated. pic.twitter.com/YXp24CRVfC — glassnode (@glassnode) May 29, 2025 A broader shift in how market participants approach Bitcoin is clearly reflected in the rising interest in options. Instead of exclusively buying and holding, or trading in the spot market, more and more investors are turning to Bitcoin options to manage risk, make speculative bets on price movements, and set up intricate (and sometimes not-so-intricate) derivatives trades. This signals, if nothing else, that the Bitcoin ecosystem is maturing, and options are a part of that maturation. Short-Term Holder Profitability Shows Healthy Market Dynamics In tandem with the thriving options market, on-chain metrics offer intriguing glimpses into the actions and gains of short-term Bitcoin holders. The Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (STH SOPR), taken as a 30-day moving average, recently reached a local high. This metric can be understood as tracking the average profit or loss realized by investors who have held (and then spent or sold) their Bitcoin for a short duration (less than a now-treasured four-year hold period). The STH SOPR (30DMA) metric, which measures the average profit or loss realized by short-term investors when spending coins on-chain, recently hit a local high STH realized profit rose noticeably. Nevertheless, demand for coins remains strong enough not to hinder the bullish… pic.twitter.com/dsE8toaEin — Axel Adler Jr (@AxelAdlerJr) May 29, 2025 The increase in STH realized profits indicates that short-term holders more frequently are capturing gains, and this reflects an environment where buying opportunities exist, and traders are effectively timing their exits. It is vital to note, however, that despite this uptick, the STH SOPR has not yet hit the euphoric levels we witnessed during previous Bitcoin price tops. This indicates that while profits are being taken, the market is not yet overheated or showing signs of excessive exuberance. A positive feedback loop is sustained by the short-term investors’ steady profitability: Profits can be reinvested and used to support trading activity, which keeps the liquidity flowing and the prices moving in the right (upward) direction. The SOPR indicator is a pretty reliable way of gauging the presence or absence of euphoric speculative bubbles in a market. And right now, it is not showing any signs of those kinds of bubbles being present. Bitcoin Spot ETFs Attract Steady Capital Inflows In addition to the burgeoning activity in derivatives markets and on-chain metrics, there is now clear evidence that investor demand for Bitcoin spot ETFs is also growing rapidly. On May 28, for instance, Bitcoin spot ETFs saw net inflows of $433 million. This follows nine straight days of inflows into these regulated investment products. Compared to other vehicles of exposure to Bitcoin, the appetite for ETFs not only continues to but also appears to be speeding up. Spot ETF inflows into Bitcoin are now comparable with inflows into gold ETFs by this point in their adoption. On May 28, Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded a net inflow of $433 million, marking 10 consecutive days of net inflows. Ethereum spot ETFs saw a net inflow of $84.89 million, extending their streak to 8 consecutive days. https://t.co/ueXcZjub6m — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 29, 2025 Funds holding Bitcoin are now under the same regulatory regime as funds that hold gold, and that’s a big deal. Trust and acceptance as an asset class are now coming at us like the floodgates have opened, and the ETF is the vehicle of choice across our bridge to traditional finance. These inflows also reinforce the bullish trend in Bitcoin’s price. Increased demand from ETFs can translate into upward price pressure. Inflows occurring over several days also say something about investor confidence. They say that confidence is strong and that market participants see value in maintaining or increasing their Bitcoin exposure. A Growing Ecosystem of Sophistication and Confidence When we look at all these data points together, they show us a very clear picture: The Bitcoin market is moving into the next stage of its maturity. This next stage is marked by not just the appearance but also the substance of increased player sophistication; as for profitability, the short-term holders of Bitcoin (i.e., the folks who buy and sell it under the one-year window of the capital gains tax) are sitting on plenty of it, with the STH SOPR being a very nice leading indicator of that realm. And as for price discovery, things are looking really good. At the same time, uninterrupted net inflows into spot ETFs highlight growing institutional confidence and adoption. They further reinforce the narrative that Bitcoin is moving, in a very controlled way, toward the kind of mainstream acceptance that assets like gold enjoy. Bitcoin is always developing, and these trends point out how critical it is to keep an eye on derivatives activity, on-chain metrics, and capital flows if you want to understand the market’s underlying strength and direction. For investors and spectators, the expanding toolkit of financial instruments and the plethora of positive market signals make for a pretty good reason to be cautiously optimistic about Bitcoin’s next growth and adoption phases.

2025-05-30T05:49:24.000Z,"Bitcoin and Ethereum Spot ETFs Continue to Attract Strong Investor Interest","May 28 represented another big day for crypto-investment products, which saw substantial net inflows for Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs. Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded an incredible net inflow of $433 million. That inflow extends the run of consecutive daily inflows to spot Bitcoin ETFs to an impressive ten days. Meanwhile, Ethereum spot ETFs maintained their own strong momentum, too, registering a net inflow of $84.89 million. Ethereum spot ETFs have now seen their own consecutive daily inflow run extended to an impressive eight days. The inflows into these ETFs reflect a developing institutional inclination toward digital assets and a newly discovered adoption of cryptocurrency investment vehicles that combine traditional finance with the nascent blockchain ecosystem. Spot ETFs are increasingly being viewed by market participants as accessible and regulatory-compliant ways of achieving exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum while avoiding the direct custody of assets. Bitcoin Spot ETFs See Ten Straight Days of Net Inflows Over the last ten days, capital has accumulated in Bitcoin’s spot ETFs with stunning consistency. On just May 28 alone, they attracted a net inflow of $433 million. That’s a clarion call from both institutional and retail investors, and it’s one of the main reasons I think the SEC may be close to approving a Bitcoin spot ETF. On May 28, Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded a net inflow of $433 million, marking 10 consecutive days of net inflows. Ethereum spot ETFs saw a net inflow of $84.89 million, extending their streak to 8 consecutive days. https://t.co/ueXcZjub6m — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 29, 2025 In the previous three months, we have seen inflows of Bitcoin. These inflows have continued and actually even picked up pace in the last month. The latest data we have indicates that in August, we saw capital inflows, net capital inflows into Bitcoin, to the tune of $107 million. Spot ETFs serve as a vital link between traditional investment structures and the world of cryptocurrencies. They present an investment vehicle that is both familiar and regulated, thus reducing the entry barriers for many investors who might prefer to stay on this side of the bridge. And the bridge has been holding up well, with strong inflows into Bitcoin spot ETFs over the past few months. Ethereum Spot ETFs Extend Their Winning Streak Ethereum spot ETFs have similarly enjoyed a sustained wave of capital inflows. On May 28, right around the time of the latest annual Divergence Strategic Summit, Ethereum contents of spot ETFs received capital inflows of $84.89 million. This extended the streak of daily gains for Ethereum-backed ETFs to eight consecutive days. The primary programmable blockchain, Ethereum continues to draw institutional investor interest as a result of forthcoming improvements in scalability and network performance. The current inflow of exchange-traded-fund capital suggests that investors believe Ethereum’s ecosystem is developing favorably and that they will secure some appreciable delta by holding that which is most likely to be a more valuable token in the years to come. ETH ICO Whale on the Move Again: Another Sell-Off Begins The legendary “1 Million #ETH ICO Whale” has resumed selling — and the numbers are massive. Just 8 hours ago, this wallet recharged 956.7 ETH (worth $2.53M) to #OKX , raising fresh sell-off alarms. Details: pic.twitter.com/y03d4FL9dL — EyeOnChain (@EyeOnChain) May 29, 2025 Capital has been coming into Ethereum ETFs steadily, which fits into a broader market trend we see. And this trend is that investors are looking to get diversified exposure to major blockchain networks beyond just Bitcoin. The way I see it, and I think a lot of people in our industry see it, this is a trend reflecting confidence in Ethereum. And their confidence isn’t unfounded. A lot of things are happening on Ethereum, to Ethereum, and with Ethereum. Whale Activity Sheds Light on Ethereum Market Dynamics While institutional investments in Ethereum ETFs appear to show an accelerating interest in the markets, it is the notable individual investment activity that provides a wealth of further insight. One of the most prominent Ethereum whales, operating from wallet 0xC8d6C156c13AC68ADA3f03B80fc201ae4867A57d, continues to make waves. This investor holds some 51,663 ETH, or $140 million worth of the digital asset, at very low basis costs: about $0.31 per ETH. Interestingly, this whale has just received an additional 24,000 ETH three days ago, which is quite the addition to their already hefty pile of ETH. Despite that, it’s good to note that this whale was just gifted 24,000 ETH three days ago. Investor actions on such a large scale send very valuable signals to the market. When savvy traders who are long-term holders of an asset accumulate it, that tends to signal to us that they are quite confident in the asset’s future trajectory. And such accumulation seems to be happening now in the Bitcoin market. This is—again—adding to the support of the price increases we are seeing. A Growing Narrative of Institutional Adoption Continued inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs and strategic activity by large holders are evidence of a maturing cryptocurrency market. Institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals see these assets as central to their portfolios, now that regulated products allow for a more straightforward and secure investment process. While the crypto ecosystem is still in its infancy, ETFs will likely help it evolve. They will help the whole ecosystem maintain compliance with financial regulations while enabling a much broader base of participation. They will also make Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other tokens (or at least those that have passed muster) much more accessible on a risk-adjusted basis to a much wider variety of investors. Not too bad for something that wasn’t even on the horizon a year or so ago. For investors and observers, the steady influx of capital and strategic accumulation make clear that there is a consensus forming around the idea that digital assets are here to stay—not that they are merely ephemeral, like a fad, but that they are something much more fundamental, like a building block of the future financial system.

Data from Hyperdash shows that Wynn's margin usage is nearing 100%, which would result in a total liquidation of his position, though Wynn recently made a deposit of $376,000 to bolster his defenses . The trader, known for making aggressive bets under the pseudonym \""moonpig,\"" currently holds a long position of approximately 1,690 BTC, valued at roughly $178.78 million. On-chain data shows that Wynn's 40x leveraged BTC bets now carry an unrealized loss of approximately $3.5 million, representing a negative return of 77%. But with BTC trading near $106,000, just slightly above Wynn’s liquidation price of around $104,607, any further decline in the asset’s price could trigger automatic forced sales.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/30/bitcoin-bull-james-wynn-close-to-total-liquidation-as-losses-near-100m,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX","Markets|Bitcoin|Leveraged Trading|Top Stories|News",cryptocompare
2025-05-30T05:34:35.000Z,"Football Team Paris Saint-Germain Scores Bitcoin Treasury Strategy","European football club Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) has become the latest to add Bitcoin to its balance sheet. The move marks the first sports entity to reveal a Bitcoin treasury strategy. Announced at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, the global club with over 550 million fans worldwide, is all about “what’s next,” said Pär Helgosson, head of PSG Labs. “Just like Bitcoin.” Helgosson called the adoption a “new generation trend,” and said that PSG started acquiring Bitcoins last year. The club’s spokesperson emphasized that 80% of PSG’s fan base is below the age of 34. “Last year, we put Bitcoin in our books. So, we took our fiat reserve and allocated Bitcoin. We still have that in our books.” JUST IN: European soccer giant Paris Saint Germain announces they adopted a #Bitcoin treasury reserve pic.twitter.com/nGeq7bUyBJ — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) May 29, 2025 The team is facing off in the Champions League soccer finals next week in Munich. PSG is currently the champion of the French domestic Ligue 1. Football Remains Most Popular Sport for Crypto A recent study by Sport Quake said that football made up 43% of all crypto and digital asset sponsorship for the 2024/25 season. This has resulted in a 64% year-over-year increase in the total amount of sponsorships. “All the growth is from football (soccer) and non-US spend as brands invest in global sponsorships and international markets while they wait to see President Trump’s US crypto policies,” said Matt House, CEO of SportQuake. Further, 44% of all crypto football sponsorships happen within Europe’s top five leagues, including France’s Ligue 1. PSG’s decision to venture into crypto accumulation follows a growing trend among corporations to include Bitcoin in their balance sheets. Corporate Adoption of Bitcoin, Crypto is Accelerating Bitcoin has become a treasury preference for more companies and brands, following President Donald Trump’s strategic Bitcoin reserve order, which helped clear the path. Dom Harz, Co-Founder of BOB (Build on Bitcoin), told Cryptonews that “ETFs have a lot to do with” the adoption. “The most interesting change we’ve seen over the last two years is the mood shift between Bitcoin once being a speculative bet and now being a strategic play for corporations,” he said via email. “From a corporate point of view, there is massive appeal. They would have a passive yield on their assets, and it offers them diversity from traditional investments.” The post Football Team Paris Saint-Germain Scores Bitcoin Treasury Strategy appeared first on Cryptonews .",cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/football-team-paris-saint-germain-scores-bitcoin-treasury-strategy/,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION","Bitcoin News|Bitcoin|Bitcoin Reserve",cryptocompare

2025-05-30T05:29:38.000Z,"Pi Network Price Prediction for June 2025","The post Pi Network Price Prediction for June 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Pi Network made an impressive start this month, but it was short-lived. The token has dropped over 75% from its February high near $3 and is currently sitting at $0.6894, down 6% in the last 24 hours and 15% over the week. Pi Coin Stuck In Tight Range With Bearish Trends Pi is currently stuck in a tight range between $0.688 and $0.816, and is hovering above key support levels. Despite the price dip, trading volume is up 42% in the past day to $158 million. But on-chain data reveals rising exchange inflows, a sign that more Pi is being prepared for selling as 263 million Pi coins will be unlocked in June, 233 million in July, and 132 million in August. The coin’s trend remains bearish with all key moving averages (10, 20, 50, 100-day EMAs and SMAs) sitting above the current price. The Bollinger Bands are tightening, and the MACD is negative. RSI is also neutral at 43.6. Unless the Pi breaks above the $0.75-$0.78 resistance range, the next key support levels are $0.60 and $0.50. If the buying volume picks up, it could retest the $0.85-$0.85 zone. However, on the flip side, it could stay stuck between $0.70 and $0.76 through May 31. Will Pi Rebound Above $1? As the first half of the year comes to a close, Pi could face more selling pressure if fear and doubt grip the market. This could push the price to $0.58-$0.65 in the short term. According to CoinDCX , if the buyer interest returns and volume picks up, it has a chance to rebound toward the $1.00-$1.20 level. If there is momentum, it could even finish June at $1.82 . The price of Pi will likely continue to decline until the end of August, after which it may slowly start to recover. I previously predicted it could drop to $0.40—unless the Pi Core Team becomes transparent. No investor wants to put money into something where the founders refuse… pic.twitter.com/KEvAwOyhX9 — Dr Altcoin (@Dr_Picoin) May 28, 2025 However, analyst Dr Altcoin predicts that Pi’s price may keep falling through August, after which it may slowly start to recover. He had previously warned that it could drop to $0.40, unless the Pi Core Team steps up with more transparency. In the long term, Pi network is pushing to build value through its $100M Ventures Fund aimed at real-world use cases in fintech, gaming, e-commerce, and AI.

New York’s tough BitLicense rules could complicate the rollout, with critics arguing that such regulations stifle innovation. Adams, however, is pushing for more flexible policies to support crypto adoption. To make this happen, he’s set up a Crypto Council to guide digital asset strategies and position NYC as a global hub for crypto innovation. On the national front, crypto momentum is building. President Donald Trump’s recent executive order established a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, acquiring about 200,000 BTC to promote government-driven Bitcoin adoption. This aligns perfectly with NYC’s local efforts, reinforcing the state’s ambition to lead in crypto finance.

2025-05-30T05:12:06.000Z,"Krypto Reserve: Laut David Sacks könnten nun doch aktive Zukäufe möglich sein – wie hoch könnte dann der Preis des Bitcoin klettern?","Im Zuge des US Präsidentschaftswahlkampfs hat sich Donald Trump ganz klar auf die Seite der Krypto-Befürworter gestellt. Schnell kam er mit der Idee der Bitcoin Reserve – man wolle zudem die USA zur Hauptstadt des Bitcoin machen. Als dann die ersten Details zur geplanten Reserve nach seiner Wahl präsentiert wurden, war die Krypto-Branche aber sichtlich enttäuscht: Trump hat einen Plan präsentiert, der nicht ganz so klang, wie das noch im Wahlkampf posaunt wurde. Trumps erster Plan zur Bitcoin Reserve Als Donald Trump am 6. März die U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve per Dekret angeordnet hat, wurde auf den Weg gegeben, dass nur die von den US Behörden konfiszierten Coins aus Straf- oder Zivilverfahren veranlagt werden sollen. Trump betonte, ein aktives Zukaufen werde es nicht geben, weil man die Amerikaner nicht belasten wolle. Wenn man Bitcoin kaufen will, dann nur haushaltsneutral, also ohne die Staatsbürger zu belasten. Im Rahmen der aktuellen Bitcoin Konferenz in Las Vegas gab es nun erste Details, dass dieser Plan nun doch in eine andere Richtung gehen könnte. So wurden Finanzminister Scott Bessent und Handelsminister Howard Lutnick bereits von Trump persönlich informiert, man solle haushaltsneutrale Strategien schaffen, damit Bitcoins zugekauft werden können. Auch David Sacks, der Krypto-Berater von Trump, gab bekannt, dass es nun zu Änderungen bei der Bitcoin Reserve kommen könnte: „Die Executive Order zur Einrichtung der strategischen Bitcoin Reserve erlaubt es der Regierung, mehr zu kaufen, wenn dies haushaltsneutral geschehen kann. Konkret: Wenn wir Howard Lutnik oder Scott Bessent davon überzeugen können, welche zu kaufen, und sie herausfinden können, wie sie es finanzieren, ohne eine neue Steuer oder ohne die Schulden zu erhöhen, dann könnten wir potenziell mehr Bitcoin erwerben.” Von wo will die USA das Geld für Zukäufe bekommen? Welche Möglichkeiten könnte es geben, dass die USA nun aktiv Bitcoin kauft, ohne das Budget zu belasten? Finanzierungsquellen könnten unter anderem überschüssige Gelder aus anderen Regierungsprogrammen sein. Die Analysten der Research Firma K33 haben bereits schon Vorschläge geäußert, welche haushaltsneutrale Strategien möglich seien, um Bitcoins kaufen zu können: Man könnte beispielsweise Sonderziehungsrechten des IWF verkaufen oder mit Überschüssen aus dem Stabilisierungsfonds, der vom Finanzministerium verwaltet wird, Bitcoin kaufen. Auf diesen Wegen könnte man frisches Geld bekommen, ohne dass die Amerikaner belastet würden. „Ich kann nichts versprechen, aber es gibt einen Weg, das zu tun“, so David Sacks. „Die Frage ist nur, können wir entweder das Finanzministerium oder das Handelsministerium dafür begeistern? Denn wenn sie das tun und herausfinden können, wie sie es finanzieren, haben sie tatsächlich die präsidentielle Genehmigung bereits in der Tasche.“ Die Homepage von Bitcoin Bull aufrufen Bitcoin Bull würde ebenfalls von aktiven Zukäufen in die Bitcoin Reserve profitieren Die neuen Pläne, dass man nun eine haushaltsneutrale Stragie erstellen wolle, um Bitcoins zukaufen zu können, freut einerseits jene, die in Bitcoin investiert haben, andererseits auch die Fans von Bitcon Bull, die bereits BTCBULL Token gekauft haben. Denn aktive Zukäufe werden wohl den Preis der Kryptowährung nach oben treiben – hier profitieren jene, die Bitcoin und BTCBULL haben. Bei Bitcoin Bull handelt es sich um ein Projekt im Initial Coin Offering, das sich in erster Linie an der Kryptowährung Bitcoin orientiert. Springt der Preis des Bitcoin auf 125.000 US Dollar, findet der erste Token Burn statt. Durch die Verknappung des Gesamtangebots kann eine Preissteigerung möglich sein, vor allem, wenn die Nachfrage bleibt oder höher wird. Bei 150.000 US Dollar gibt es dann die erste Belohnung für die BTCBULL Investoren. Abhängig von der Menge an BTCBULL Token, die gehalten werden, fällt die Höhe der Belohnung aus. Überspringt der Bitcoin die 175.000 US Dollar, dann folgt der nächste Token Burn, beim Überspringen der 200.000 US Dollar die nächste Belohnung. Überspringt der Bitcoin dann die 225.000 US Dollar-Hürde, gibt es den letzten Token Burn und beim Erreichen der 250.000 US Dollar die letzte Belohnung. Derzeit gibt es BTCBULL Token nur über die Plattform selbst. Erst nach dem Ende des Presales kann BTCBULL auch über offizielle Kryptobörsen gekauft werden.

2025-05-30T05:11:15.000Z,"How James Wynn Lost $60 Million in a Week Trading Bitcoin","The post How James Wynn Lost $60 Million in a Week Trading Bitcoin appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In the world of cryptocurrency trading, fortunes can be made — and lost — in a matter of days. One such example is James Wynn , a crypto trader famous for using high leverage in his trades. Recently, Wynn faced one of the biggest losses of his career, losing over $60 million in just seven days. What Happened? The trouble began on May 19th, when Wynn opened a big trade on Bitcoin using 40x leverage. This means for every $1 of his own money, he borrowed $40 to increase his bet. He started with 5,520 Bitcoin at a price of around $103,300. Over the next few days, he kept increasing his position, pushing it past 9,300 Bitcoin and then above the $1 billion mark. At first, it looked like a smart move. As Bitcoin’s price rose, Wynn’s trade showed unrealized profits of over $10 million. He even locked in some gains by closing part of his position. But the market soon turned against him. A drop in Bitcoin’s price, triggered by news about new U.S. tariffs on European goods, caused his position to lose value fast. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Is Crypto Going Down Today? , Wynn tried to recover by adding new trades and switching strategies, but the losses kept piling up. By May 26th, he had lost about $60 million, making it one of the steepest declines of his career. Despite the setback, he mentioned that his trading account still had around $25 million in profits from earlier trades. Who Is James Wynn? James Wynn became famous in the crypto world during the 2022 bull market. Back then, he reportedly got support from Alameda Research, a trading firm known for backing new crypto traders. Wynn gained attention for his aggressive trading style, using leverage levels as high as 40x to amplify his positions . He made big profits trading Bitcoin and meme coins like Pepe Coin and Official Trump Token . His strategy involves reacting quickly to market moves and even using social media to share his positions, which sometimes influences other traders. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-29T13:30:00.000Z,"How African innovators are using blockchain to solve real problems","While blockchain headlines in the West often focus on speculation and regulation, in Africa, it’s a different story, one rooted in necessity, innovation and grassroots adoption. The latest episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast explores this ground-up revolution with Kevin Imani, head of StarkWare’s Africa Venture Studio, who shares how communities across the continent are using blockchain to tackle real-world problems in finance, energy and connectivity.A student movement“Young students were using blockchain before it was mainstream,” Imani explained. From Kenya to Nigeria, local needs, not hype, drove early adoption. In many cases, it was students receiving digital currencies from abroad or freelancers getting paid in dollars and struggling to convert funds into local currency. With limited banking infrastructure or trust in government institutions, decentralized alternatives offered a lifeline.Imani highlighted how centralized systems like Kenya’s E-Mpesa changed access to finance, but still fall short for international payments or off-ramping digital assets. Related: Blockchain.com expands in Africa as local crypto rules take shape“You have to start becoming a trader almost,” he said, describing the convoluted process of converting stablecoins or crypto earnings into usable local funds. This trust gap has fueled peer-to-peer crypto usage. “These were kids holding stablecoins not to spend them, but to store value.” Even before regulators or startups built formal infrastructure, communities had already found use cases for blockchain.Blockchain beyond finance Beyond finance, African innovators are tapping blockchain to address energy insecurity. In rural Zambia, excess power from a mini hydro station could go to waste. Instead, residents can now use that surplus to mine Bitcoin, for example, generating revenue and creating a sustainable power loop. “It’s self-sustaining and reduces waste,” Imani said.Connectivity is another frontier. In areas where traditional internet providers fall short, decentralized WiFi hotspot networks are emerging. With blockchain, community members can share bandwidth and be compensated instantly and transparently. “You don’t need a middleman. It’s fair and trackable,” he said.Still, mainstream adoption remains cautious. Governments like those in Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa are in “standby mode,” focused more on consumer protection than full-scale implementation. But Imani remains optimistic: “The need is there. The technology is here. The only question is how we bridge that gap.”To hear the full conversation on The Clear Crypto Podcast, listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

2025-05-29T13:23:06.000Z,"Tim Berners-Lee says internet DNS should have been more decentralized","World Wide Web and hypertext markup language (HTML) inventor Tim Berners-Lee said that if he were building a domain name service (DNS) today, he would make it “more decentralized.”Speaking at ETH Prague on stage alongside Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, Berners-Lee reflected on early internet architecture decisions.“If I could go back […] I would make it more decentralized,“ he said.DNS was invented in 1983 by Paul Mockapetris, replacing the previous hosts.txt file-based system with a scalable, distributed system for naming IP addresses. Still, while Berners-Lee was not personally responsible for DNS development, he could have opted for a URL structure not tied to the DNS we know today, or he could have pushed for a decentralized alternative. Source: Mely.ethRelated: Decentralized naming could bring ‘next billion’ users to BitcoinCentralization of the DNSThe DNS system is highly centralized, particularly at its top levels of hierarchy. The root zone, which governs top-level domains such as .com and .org, is managed by the US-based nonprofit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).Furthermore, the most authoritative servers are operated by a handful of organizations, further centralizing the system. This allows for easy censorship and control by governments that can unilaterally seize or block domain names.This degree of centralization also makes outages due to centralized service disruption more likely. Control over root zones and domain policies is also concentrated in a few regions and among a select group of stakeholders.There are also concerns regarding privacy because centralized DNS queries can be monitored, logged and intercepted by internet service providers and other intermediaries.Related: Community split on ENS petition against Unstoppable Domains patentCrypto’s solution to the problemDecentralized alternatives to the DNS system are being developed. The most well-known is the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), which maps human-readable names to Ethereum addresses, content on the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS), or other data.Another alternative is Unstoppable Domains. Its system mints domains as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Ethereum and Polygon.ENS has seen a fair share of adoption. In late 2024, ENS Labs also partnered with PayPal and Venmo, sparking speculation about how this partnership is likely to boost mainstream adoption.IPFS runs on Ethereum smart contracts and aims to be user-owned and censorship-resistant. Currently, it is primarily used in Web3 applications, wallets and decentralized websites.Another alternative is Handshake (HNS), which aims to be a decentralized and permissionless naming protocol that is compatible with traditional DNS. A project with a similar aim is Namecoin (NMC), an early Bitcoin fork designed specifically to offer .bit domains and store DNS records onchain with censorship resistance.IPFS is also accompanied by its own Inter-Planetary Name System (IPNS), which enables mutable naming for IPFS addresses (hashes). URLs generated this way point to specific content, not servers.A non-crypto alternative to DNS is OpenNIC. This is a user-run project that offers non-ICANN domains, aiming to decentralize control through community governance.Magazine: Move to Portugal to become a crypto digital nomad — Everybody else is",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/tim-berners-lee-says-dns-should-have-been-more-decentralized?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

In a May 29 X post, Aave founder Stani Kulechov said the foundation borrowed $2 million in GHO tokens. “The EF is not only supplying ETH to Aave, but also borrowing from Aave,” Kulechov wrote, describing the development as “the full DeFi circle.”GHO is a decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin native to the Aave Protocol. Unlike centralized stablecoins, GHO is governed by Aave’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which oversees interest rates, collateral requirements and facilitator selection. The move highlights the EF’s growing engagement with the DeFi ecosystem, moving toward more sophisticated treasury strategies. The foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Source: Stani KulechovEthereum Foundation previously deployed $120 million in DeFiThe foundation’s move to borrow GHO follows a previous $120 million deployment into various protocols, signaling a shift in how it manages its crypto holdings. In February, the EF deployed 45,000 Ether (ETH) across different DeFi protocols, including Aave, Spark and Compound. At the time, the Ether was worth $120 million. Kulechov previously described the fund deployment as the foundation’s “biggest allocation in DeFi.” Because of the move, the Aave founder said that DeFi will win, expressing optimism as the EF added liquidity to the protocol.Apart from Kulechov, community members also celebrated the move, supporting the EF’s ETH holdings management shift. A community member said the development was a win, saying the foundation should “keep it up,” while an X user said it would be positive if the EF continued to use their funds this way. Related: Ethereum Foundation unveils security initiative to supplant legacy systemsCriticisms of the foundation selling Ether In January, Ethereum community members called on the foundation to explore alternatives to selling ETH for operational funding.

He called the practice “insane,” urging the EF to stake or use DeFi instead of selling. Anthony Sassano, host of The Daily Gwei, proposed that the EF stake part of its ETH and sell the staking rewards.

Mainstream browsers will also integrate agentic capabilities or build interoperability with purpose-built agentic browsers as AI becomes cheaper, according to Zhu.However, the most significant adoption will come within the next decade when onchain and offchain environments will be completely merged for internet users, Zhu said, adding:“Agentic browsers are poised to become the default entry point — much like smartphones replaced feature phones.”In the long term, Donut aims to support payments, gaming, content creation and social interaction, all within a single crypto-native browser. The company also plans to leverage advancements in decentralized identity and confidential computing to turn the browser into a personal “crypto CFO” for retail users.

The retail CBDC pilot is being conducted with select customers and merchants through participating banks, while the wholesale pilot is targeting use in the interbank market.Per the report, the retail pilot has reached 600,000 users across 17 banks. To further scale adoption, the RBI has allowed “certain non-banks [...] to offer CBDC wallets.”The wholesale pilot has also seen increased institutional interest. The scope of the wholesale was further expanded and diversified with the addition of four standalone primary dealers (SPDs), the report confirmed.Related: Indian high court orders steps to block Proton MailIndia dominates real-time paymentsDuring the financial year 2024–25, digital payments in India experienced significant growth, both in terms of volume and value.

The RBI noted that the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) “placed India in a leadership position with a share of 48.5 percent in global real-time payments by volume.”The central bank said several innovative features were introduced to extend the benefits of digital payments to wider segments of society.For instance, the report mentions that the “Delegated Payments” feature was rolled out, allowing “individuals (primary user) to allow another individual (secondary user) to make UPI transactions up to a limit from the primary user’s bank account.”An excerpt of the report.

New features include “Magic Nodes,” which uncover hidden wallet connections among tokenholders, and “Time Travel,” a tool that reconstructs the historical distribution of tokens, potentially detecting early insider activity or coordinated accumulation efforts.“Historical data in crypto is notoriously hard to access because it gets buried under endless new transactions,” Bubblemaps CEO Nicolas Vaiman told Cointelegraph.“Time Travel changes that. It’s like watching a Big Bang, from the initial burst of a single bubble to a full-grown distribution,” he said.Source: BubblemapsThe tool allows users to rewind the token’s entire life cycle and evolving distribution structure, which will help them spot “early signs of manipulation or coordinated dumps,” Vaiman added.Related: Sui validators vote on $162M Cetus recovery plan to restore user fundsSpotting tokens with a large portion of the supply concentrated across a few wallets can help investors detect scams such as rug pulls, where insiders remove liquidity or stage a mass sell-off, resulting in a steep price collapse that leaves investors with worthless tokens.A large-scale rug pull hit the crypto industry on March 16 after the sudden collapse of the Wolf of Wall Street-inspired WOLF token, created by Hayden Davis, the co-creator of the Official Melania Meme (MELANIA) and the Libra token.Source: BubblemapsThe memecoin saw a 99% crash, wiping out most of its peak $42 million market capitalization within a few hours.

CEO Leah Wald said the move supports the company’s long-term growth plans.“The filing of a base shelf prospectus supports our growth strategy by providing us with the flexibility to access capital as future opportunities arise in the rapidly evolving Solana ecosystem,” she said.Source: Sol StrategiesIn a May 28 announcement, Solana treasury firm DeFi Dev announced its adoption of Solana liquid staking tokens. The firm will now divert part of its Solana holdings to the liquid staking token dfdvSOL.The announcement followed DeFi Dev’s addition of 88,164 SOL to its treasury in late April, valued at $11.5 million at the time, when it held $34.4 million worth of Solana (SOL).Related: Solana chart hints at 180% rally to $300 if key technical trend holdsWhat is liquid staking?Liquid staking allows tokenholders to earn staking rewards without locking up their assets. Instead, they receive a liquid token that can be traded or used in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.  DeFi Dev expects the adoption of this technology to “enhance the company’s validator operations and treasury management, consistent with its mission to maximize SOL Per Share” growth. Chief investment officer and chief operating officer Parker White said:The adoption of dfdvSOL not only creates additional ways to drive stake to our validators and increase SOL holdings, but also advances our role as a long-term participant in the Solana ecosystem.”Related: Solana may be a memecoin ‘one-trick pony’ — Standard CharteredSol Strategies prepares to safeguard capitalSol Strategies also announced on May 28 that it had completed several key audits and certifications. The company passed SOC 2 Type 1 and SOC 1 Type 1 audits and received ISO 27001 certification for its Solana staking platform.  SOC 2 Type 1 is a report assessing a company’s controls related to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality or privacy at a specific point in time. Such an audit verifies that the firm’s controls meet trust service criteria at the time of the check.SOC 1 Type 1 is a similar report focused on internal controls over financial reporting at a specific point in time. This audit evaluates whether the controls are appropriately designed, but does not assess their effectiveness over time.Lastly, ISO 27001 is an international standard specifying requirements for an information security management system. These standards help manage risks pertaining to data confidentiality, integrity and availability through a continuous improvement framework.To obtain this ISO certificate, a company must demonstrate both the documentation and implementation of controls. Sol Strategies’ Wald explained that all these measures are meant to ensure institutional trust:“By achieving SOC 2 Type 1 and SOC 1 Type 1, alongside our ISO 27001 certification, we’ve demonstrated that institutional clients can trust SOL Strategies with their Solana staking needs.”The compliance efforts come as the firm continues to position itself as a major Solana validator.

At current prices, the stash is valued at about $7.6 billion.Arkham said the newly identified wallets bring Strategy’s total identified holdings to $54.5 billion.
