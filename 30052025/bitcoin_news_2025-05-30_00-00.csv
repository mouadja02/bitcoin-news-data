2025-05-29T21:45:32.000Z,"Nigel Farage Vows to Establish BTC Reserve and Pass Pro-Crypto Legislation Once in Government","Reform UK leader Nigel Farage promised today to pass crypto-friendly legislation and establish a bitcoin BTC reserve at the Bank of England if he comes into government. “We have put together… the Crypto Assets and Digital Finance Bill. We will campaign for this, and we will put it in place when we win in the general election,” Farage said on stage at the Bitcoin conference in Las Vegas. “We are going to launch, in Britain, a crypto revolution. We’re going to make London one of the major trading centers of the world. We’re deadly serious,” Farage added. The legislation will prohibit banks from debanking customers for interacting with crypto, Farage stated. He also talked about implementing a capital gains tax of 10% of crypto assets, arguing that “If taxes are reasonable, people will pay them.” He argued against the implementation of a British central bank digital currency (CBDC) as well. Reform UK has been ascendant in British polls recently; the party also performed well in local elections earlier in May. The next general election, however, is currently slated for August 2029. The party announced on Thursday that it would become the first European political party to accept crypto donations.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/05/29/nigel-farage-vows-to-establish-btc-reserve-and-pass-pro-crypto-legislation-once-in-government,"BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING","Policy|UK|Nigel Farage|Bitcoin|News",cryptocompare
2025-05-29T21:35:59.000Z,"Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino comfirms the company holds over 100,000 BTC and 50+ tons of gold","Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, told a packed audience at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas Thursday that the company now holds more than 100,000 BTC and over 50 tons of gold, confirming its spot as one of the largest holders of both assets in the crypto industry. Per Cryptopolitan’s calculations, the bitcoin stash is worth over $10 billion at current prices, and the gold bars make up another huge slice of reserves. On the same presentation slide, Paolo showed that Tether earned a $13 billion profit in 2024, making it the most profitable name in crypto by a long shot. Paolo explains Tether’s gold decision at the Bitcoin event The crowd at Bitcoin 2025 wasn’t full of gold lovers, but Paolo didn’t dodge that. He responded directly to the tension. “Many bitcoiners don’t like talking about gold as if gold would take away something from Bitcoin. There is no way. Bitcoin is perfect. Gold is imperfect,” Paolo said . He added, “Gold is not competing with bitcoin; gold is competing with fiat and that’s why we like a little bit of gold.” “We invested 2 billion in energy production and bitcoin mining actually is a bit more than that. Something that we have been very shy to say, but I think that it’s very realistic that by the end of the year, Tether will be the biggest Bitcoin miner in the world, even including all the public companies.” Tether’s most recent financial disclosure for Q1 2025 laid out its current reserves. The report confirmed that Tether is holding over $7 billion in bitcoin and more than $6 billion in standard physical gold bars. That bitcoin valuation was based on a BTC price of around $83,000 at the time of the report. And that’s not the only tie-in. Earlier Thursday, Tether backer Cantor Fitzgerald Asset Management announced a new product: a fund that will offer direct exposure to bitcoin with “1-to-1 downside protection based on the price of gold.” While all that was happening, Tether-backed company Twenty One Capital was updating its financial filing. The company raised another $100 million by selling convertible notes, bringing its total raise to $685 million. Twenty One is led by Jack Mallers, founder of Strike, and is forming through a SPAC merger with Cantor Equity Partners, which is already listed on Nasdaq. Before this new round, Twenty One had already locked down $585 million, with $385 million from earlier convertible notes and $200 million through a PIPE deal. This latest funding will go straight into buying more bitcoin. The company already spent $458 million on BTC earlier this month, and another $3.6 billion came in as part of the merger.

2025-05-29T21:30:07.000Z,"Crypto Expert Sells Off Bitcoin Holdings, Gives Reasons Why","Crypto expert Crypto Beast has made a shocking revelation, stating that he has sold off his Bitcoin holdings just as the flagship crypto recently hit a new all-time high (ATH) . The expert further gave reasons why he made this move, indicating he was looking to pivot to altcoins. Expert Gives Reasons Why He Sold Off Bitcoin Holdings In an X post , Crypto Beast stated he has sold all his Bitcoins. He opined that BTC’s dominance has peaked and will drop massively in the coming months, suggesting that the top might be in for the flagship crypto following its latest rally to a new ATH. The expert added that the BTC price cannot record another 100% move from here, while most altcoins he holds will still witness a 5x to 20x surge. He also revealed that he plans to sell his altcoins at their peak and buy back Bitcoin during the bear market. In an X post , crypto analyst Rekt Capital also commented on BTC’s dominance. He noted that May is coming to a close and that the dominance is firmly positioned for a successful retest of 64% as support. The analyst added that any short-term dips in the Bitcoin dominance would still enable altcoin moves. However, he warned that the BTC DOM still looks positioned for more upside towards the 71% area over time. In an earlier X post , he stated that Bitcoin has just begun its “Price Discovery Uptrend 2” and that it still has many weeks of upside ahead. Rekt Capital noted that there will be normal dips and pullbacks for Bitcoin during this uptrend, but the general macro upside lies ahead. Veteran trader Peter Brandt also raised the possibility of the BTC price rallying to as high as $150,000 by August, indicating that the flagship crypto has more room to rally to the upside. Altcoin Season Is On The Horizon Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto has made a case for altcoins, predicting that they would soon enjoy massive gains while Bitcoin’s dominance declines. In an X post , the analyst stated that altseason is brewing and that it is becoming clear on the chart. In another X post , he remarked that the Bitcoin dominance is looking to plunge and that it is time for altcoins to show. Ethereum is known to usually lead this altcoin season , and Mikybull Crypto is confident that a parabolic rally is loading for the ETH price. In an X post , the crypto analyst stated that ETH is breaking out and that $3,200 is the next target for the altcoin. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $107,938, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-expert-bitcoin-sell-off/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Bitcoin News|Altcoin Season|altcoins|bitcoin|Bitcoin dominance|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Coinmarketcap|Crypto Beast|MilkyBull Crypto|Peter Brandt|Price Discovery Uptrend 2|Rekt Capital",cryptocompare

2025-05-29T21:10:36.000Z,"U.S. House Republicans Officially Introduce Crypto Market Structure Bill","Leading Republicans in the House of Representatives have formally introduced their latest version of the bill to establish a regulatory structure for digital assets markets, something the industry has clamored for for years. The successor to the previous session's Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), the new bill called the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act is being pushed by top Republicans in the House Financial Services and the House Agriculture committees. Stablecoin legislation is still the frontrunner to be the first major piece of U.S. crypto law, but Thursday's introduction pushes the ball forward on the more important and complex of the two companion efforts. \""America should be the global leader in the digital assets marketplace, but we can’t do that without establishing a clear regulatory framework,\"" said Representative Dusty Johnson, the South Dakota Republican who leads the agriculture subcommittee focused on digital assets, in a statement on the bill's introduction. The hefty 236-page Clarity Act — likely a starting point for lengthy negotiations between the parties in the House and eventually their Senate counterparts — gives the Commodity Futures Trading Commission \""exclusive regulatory jurisdiction over digital commodity cash or spot markets that occur on or with new CFTC registered entities,\"" which represents the bulk of crypto activity according to the current thinking of U.S. regulators. The legislation would set up a regime in which crypto platforms would have options for registration with the CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission, depending on whether they're trading in digital assets commodities such as bitcoin BTC, securities or both. Those seeking registration with the CFTC as a digital commodity exchange, broker or dealer could get provisional registrations while the agency is working on rules. The bill also requires crypto platforms to be regulated as financial firms under the Bank Secrecy Act; exempts certain decentralized finance (DeFi) operations and wallet providers from SEC oversight; bans future efforts of regulators to force custody firms to hold their customers' assets on their own balance sheets as the SEC staff sought to do under a now-scrapped accounting stance; and puts some transactional authorities over payment stablecoins — which are clearly stated to not be securities — in the hands of whichever regulator already oversees the firm involved in the activity. The Clarity Act additionally delved into so-called \""qualified digital asset custodians\"" — previously a controversial point when the SEC sought to allow only a narrow array of regulated custodians to handle the assets of investment advisers' clients. The new bill sets the standard for such a custodian as one under \""adequate supervision and appropriate regulation by certain federal, state, or foreign authorities\"" — a bar the CFTC will be called to define. DeFi is kicked down the road, with the bill demanding the SEC, CFTC and Treasury Department study that arena of digital assets and come back with a report in a year on how to proceed. The Government Accountability Office would also be asked to write a report on DeFi and on non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The involved regulators would have a year to put the Clarity Act's market structure rules into effect if the law were enacted. That's a tight timeframe for complex financial regulation, which can often take more than a year — or even several years — for the agency staffs to write rules and seek public input. Despite similar timelines in the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, for instance, there are still a few provisions that haven't yet been completed. The Senate will return to a floor debate next week on its stablecoin bill, which has already cleared several procedural hurdles with bipartisan support, despite loud Democratic misgivings about President Donald Trump's personal business connections to the crypto sector his government is seeking to regulate. But it's unclear whether that legislation will mesh with whatever version of stablecoin oversight the House eventually votes on, leaving uncertainty about exactly how crypto legislation will proceed in this session. Some discussion remains about whether the stablecoin and market structure bills should be combined as a single crypto push in Congress. Trump has called for both to land on his desk by the August congressional break, though many crypto insiders in Washington see that as a highly ambitious goal. The relevant House committees are set to hold digital assets hearings next week that will give members a chance to publicly discuss the details of the legislation.

2025-05-29T21:01:32.000Z,"Bitcoin Powers to $112K, But On-Chain Metrics Warn of Potential Pause: CryptoQuant","Bitcoin continues to dominate headlines after smashing through a new all-time high of $112,000 last week, reinforcing bullish sentiment across the crypto markets . Yet, despite the hype, on-chain data from CryptoQuant suggests traders should tread with caution—a cooling period may be on the horizon. Bull Score Index Points to Bull Market Continuation According to CryptoQuant , Bitcoin remains solidly in bull market territory. The Bull Score Index—a key measure of on-chain activity—currently stands at 80. Historically, this index has reliably indicated that Bitcoin continues to trend upwards as long as it remains above 50. This strong score reflects robust participation from retail and institutional investors, further fueled by macro tailwinds and increasing global adoption. The market’s optimism is backed by substantial demand: in the past 30 days alone, Bitcoin demand grew by an estimated 229,000 BTC. While this is still under the 279,000 BTC peak seen in December 2024, it’s getting close—a potential indicator that the current buying frenzy might be losing steam. Whale Accumulation Slows, Demand Nears Historical Top Though investor enthusiasm is still evident, there are early signs that the rally could be approaching a plateau. Whale-held Bitcoin balances have climbed 2.8% in the last month—a pace that has historically preceded a slowdown in large-scale accumulation. With buying activity nearing levels associated with local tops, Bitcoin may enter a period of consolidation. CryptoQuant’s data implies that while the bull market isn’t over, the current growth rate may not be sustainable without a short-term correction or pause. Traders’ Profit Margins Hint at Imminent Resistance Another key metric to watch is the Trader’s Unrealized Profit Margin, which rose to 32% last week. When this figure nears 40%, or drops below its 30-day moving average—currently at 19%—price momentum often weakens. If Bitcoin does maintain its upward trajectory, $120K could act as the next major resistance. This level coincides with the upper band of the On-chain Traders’ Realized Price—a historical ceiling during past bull runs. In short, while the broader outlook remains bullish, CryptoQuant’s indicators suggest caution. As Bitcoin scales new heights, savvy investors should watch the metrics closely—the next few weeks could determine whether this rally continues or cools off.

2025-05-29T21:00:50.000Z,"Ethereum Spot Premium Signals Strength – $2,800 Resistance In Focus","Ethereum is showing signs of renewed strength as it continues to trade above the $2,700 level, reaching as high as $2,790 in recent hours. The price action has energized the market, with many analysts now calling for a major breakout that could not only lift ETH further but also trigger the long-awaited altseason. Related Reading: Altseason Loading? Analyst Explains How FTX $5B Distribution May Trigger The Next Bull Leg While Bitcoin has led the rally for most of the year, Ethereum appears to be catching up. According to top analyst Daan, the ETH spot premium remains firm, signaling sustained demand even in the absence of ETF-level inflows. “It doesn’t have as many ETF inflows as BTC does,” Daan noted. This relative strength, combined with growing optimism around altcoins, is fueling speculation that Ethereum could soon test—and possibly break—critical resistance levels. With sentiment turning bullish across the market and ETH gaining momentum, all eyes are now on whether it can push past key resistance and lead the charge into a broader altcoin breakout. The coming days could prove pivotal as Ethereum sets the tone for the next phase of crypto market expansion. Ethereum Tests Critical Resistance As It Faces A Pivotal Moment Ethereum is now confronting what many analysts consider the most important resistance level of the current cycle. The zone between $2,700 and $2,800 has become the battleground for ETH’s next major move. A successful breakout could trigger a run toward all-time highs, while rejection may lead to a healthy—but deeper—retracement. Global macro conditions are adding weight to this moment. Rising U.S. Treasury yields and persistent inflation continue to rattle traditional markets, increasing systemic stress. Yet, in this uncertain environment, Ethereum and Bitcoin have shown resilience, suggesting that investors are increasingly viewing them as alternatives or hedges against traditional financial risks. Daan shared insights reinforcing this bullish outlook. According to his analysis, the ETH spot premium remains firm despite lacking the ETF-driven inflows seen with Bitcoin. ETH doesn’t require as much inflow relative to its market cap to sustain bullish momentum. However, the $2,800 level remains a significant barrier. It represents a key inflection point for Ethereum’s price action and overall market sentiment. The coming days are crucial, as Ethereum’s ability to either break above or get rejected at this resistance could shape the altcoin market’s direction for the rest of the quarter. Related Reading: Dogecoin Flashes Buy Signal – Key Indicator Hints At Rebound ETH Price Analysis: Testing Key Liquidity Levels Ethereum is currently trading at $2,731 on the 4-hour chart, showing strong bullish momentum as it tests the key $2,800 resistance level. After weeks of consolidation between $2,500 and $2,700, ETH has broken out with conviction, riding higher moving averages and increased volume. The 34 EMA at $2,622 and the 50 SMA at $2,598 continue to act as dynamic support, confirming the strength of the uptrend. This breakout attempt follows a long period of compression, where ETH built a base of higher lows. Price has now surged to challenge a major resistance zone that has historically capped upward momentum. If bulls manage to flip this level into support, it could open the door to a sharp move toward $3,000 and higher. Related Reading: Solana Funding Rates Turn Negative – Early Sign Of Selling Pressure? Volume has picked up on the most recent push, a positive sign that buyers are stepping in with more confidence.

(CSE: HODL) announced an additional purchase of Solana (SOL) coins to strengthen its balance sheet. The Canadian company announced on Thursday that it acquired an additional 26,478 SOL coins for $4.7 million at an average price of about $177. According to the announcement, SOL Strategies sold its remaining 3.21 Bitcoin at an average price of about $103,251, thus earning a total of $331k. As a result, the company now holds a total of 420,355 SOL, currently worth more than $70 million. “These transactions align with the Company’s focused strategy of concentrating its digital asset holdings in SOL to support its validator operations and long-term investment approach in the Solana ecosystem,” the company noted . Rising Demand for Solana by Institutional Investors As a top-tier U.S. made crypto project, Solana network has significantly benefited from the rising demand from institutional investors. In addition to SOL Strategies, the Solana network has received significant boost from other publicly traded companies led by Janover Inc. (NASDAQ: JNVR), which purchased 80,567 Solana coins valued at $10.5 million last month. As of this writing, Janover held about 163,651 SOL coins, worth about $27 million. The Solana network has also received a significant boost from fund managers seeking to offer its spot SOL ETFs in the United States, led by Grayscale , Franklin Templeton, VanEck, Bitwise , 21Shares, Fidelity, and Canary Capital. What Next for SOL Price As May approaches the end over the weekend, SOL price will likely follow Bitcoin in a potential bullish rebound. Moreover, SOL price has been trapped in a consolidation during the past three weeks. In the daily timeframe, SOL price has been forming a possible bullish continuation pattern. As a result, a consistent close above $185 in the coming days will solidify a rally towards the next target of beyond $210.

2025-05-29T20:58:07.000Z,"Former PayPal CEO Makes Exciting Predictions About Bitcoin","Former PayPal President and Lightspark CEO David Marcus made striking statements about the future of Bitcoin and the latest developments in the sector in the Squawk Box program he attended on CNBC. Speaking after the Bitcoin 2025 Conference, Marcus argued that digital assets have now become an important part of the mainstream financial system. One of Marcus’ most striking statements was, “Many major US banks are about to join the Bitcoin network.” Marcus, who stated that institutions such as NewBank, one of the leading digital banks in Latin America, and Revolut, based in Europe, have already integrated into the Bitcoin network with the Lightspark infrastructure, announced that major US-based banks will soon take similar steps. “We are currently active in 70 countries and users can convert any currency to another in real time 24 hours a day, seven days a week,” he said. Related News: Critical Ethereum Report from JPMorgan: Can ETH Recover? According to Marcus, Bitcoin is making the “digital gold” vision that has been talked about for years a reality. “This is no longer just an idea; it is happening, and people really care about Bitcoin,” he said. Marcus, who predicted that developments such as GameStop’s inclusion of Bitcoin on its balance sheet would become widespread in the corporate world, said, “After companies such as MicroStrategy, which first adopted this strategy, dozens of new companies are now moving forward on this path.” Marcus said that this diversity enables Bitcoin to be adopted more at the institutional level and creates a structure that distributes risk. On the program, Marcus was also asked about President Donald Trump and his family’s interest in cryptocurrencies. “The president’s family can buy stocks, hold bonds, why can’t they hold crypto assets?” Marcus asked, and he stated that regulations in this area should be made within the framework of ethical principles. “Digital assets are now a mainstream investment class and more people, even politicians’ families, are starting to acquire these assets,” he said. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-29T20:49:45.000Z,"Pakistan to Establish Bitcoin Reserve Amid IMF Scrutiny","Pakistan has recently announced plans to create a national Bitcoin reserve. According to the post on X , this move has attracted much attention in the global financial and crypto sectors. There is no doubt that the country wants to lead in adopting digital assets, even though it may face challenges with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Pakistan Government Has Lots of Plans for its Bitcoin Reserve The Pakistani government affirmed that it will create a national Bitcoin wallet to store its reserves safely. Officials emphasized that these holdings are for long-term investment and will not be sold. As such, Pakistan is allocating 2,000 megawatts of electricity to support Bitcoin mining and to create AI-powered data centers. This move shows the government’s commitment to using advanced technology to enhance national development. Ultimately, the goal is to make Pakistan a regional digital finance and innovation center. Meanwhile, this move has raised eyebrows considering the IMF’s stance on Bitcoin reserves. The IMF has warned countries like El Salvador about buying Bitcoin due to financial stability worries, regulatory issues, and monetary policy risks. Although the IMF has not responded formally to Pakistan’s announcement, its previous objections could affect the next program review. Pakistan Eyes Leading Role in Digital Finance Pakistan’s recent efforts to formalize its crypto sector align with its strong global performance. The country ranked ninth in Chainalysis’ 2024 Global Crypto Adoption Index, driven primarily by high retail participation. According to Statista, the number of crypto users in Pakistan will surpass 27 million by 2025. These statistics highlight the sector’s rapid growth in a population of 247 million. With infrastructure, incentives, and regulation all moving into place, Pakistan appears poised to become a major digital asset and AI hub. IMF Redefines Bitcoin Recall that the IMF has significantly changed how digital assets like BTC are classified in global financial systems. The financial organization released a new edition of its Balance of Payments Manual (BPM7) to introduce detailed classifications for Bitcoin, stablecoins, and other digital assets. Notably, this move impacts how nations record crypto transactions and how these assets are taxed and regulated. The new manual categorizes Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies as non-produced non-financial assets. This means they are considered capital assets, like land, art, or intellectual property, rather than traditional money or financial investments. The IMF explained that Bitcoin’s role as a medium of exchange without liabilities sets it apart from government-backed money.

2025-05-29T20:36:09.000Z,"Bitcoin Slides Below $106K; Analyst Sees Ether Breakout Looming","Bitcoin BTC quietly slid to its weakest price in nine days on Thursday afternoon as crypto markets cooled off after a multi-week rally from the April lows. The top cryptocurrency hit a session low of $105,750 before rebounding to just above $106,000. It was down 1.5% in the last 24 hours, but still only 5% away from record high levels. The CoinDesk 20 — an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization except for exchange coins, memecoins and stablecoins — has slumped 0.9% in the last 24 hours, with solana SOL and avalanche AVAX underperforming BTC with losses of 1.8% and 2%, respectively. Meanwhile, Ethereum's ether ETH and XRP XRP defied the downtrend with 1%-2% gains. Crypto stocks have had a relatively muted session. Coinbase (COIN) is down 2.7% but Strategy (MSTR) has risen 0.8%. Bitcoin mining firms Bitfarms (BITF), Bit Digital (BTBT), CleanSpark (CLSK) and Greenidge Generation Holding (GREE) booked roughly 4% losses. A check on traditional markets showed U.S. equities giving back most of the gains on yesterday's court ruling that blocked the Trump administration's global tariffs. However, a U.S. appeals court today reinstated the tariffs while the government appealed the earlier ruling, perhaps adding to investor uncertainty. LMAX Group market strategist Joel Kruger expects a volatile ride with tariffs again back in focus with the ongoing appeal and the self-imposed July 9 deadline for trade deals approaching, but still sees further upside for digital assets. “Bitcoin remains robust in the latter half of the week, consolidating just below its recent peak while steadfastly holding above $100,000 for 20 consecutive days, underscoring persistent bullish momentum,\"" he said. Ether shows strength, analysts note Kruger also noted that Ethereum's ether shows signs of snapping its multi-year downtrend against BTC, as the corporate crypto treasury bonanza has reached the second-largest digital asset with SharpLink Gaming's (SBET) $425 million fundraising plan. Arthur Aziz, founder and investor of B2 Ventures, said that ETH is coiling for a breakout but warned of downside risks. Sharing his technical analysis in a note, he said the $2,750 level has posed significant barrier capping gains over the past weeks, while the $2,550-2,450 area emerged as a key support level. He noted that ETH is forming a bullish ascending triangle pattern, which historically preceded rallies to higher prices. \""The stage for a future $3,000 level breakout is being set right now,\"" he said. However, \""abusing\"" leverage in futures markets could trigger a \""sharp breakdown\"" below the $2,550-2,450 support zone in cascading selling.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/29/bitcoin-slides-below-106k-analyst-sees-ether-breakout-looming,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","Markets|Market Wrap|market analysis|Bitcoin|Ethereum|News",cryptocompare

Speaking at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas on Thursday, Mizrachi said he’s been thinking of ways Panama’s capital city, which is home to the Panama Canal, could implement bitcoin payments. This includes potentially setting up a strategic bitcoin reserve for Panama City, as well as possibly taking payments — including for passage through the Panama Canal — in bitcoin, Mizrachi said. “What if you have a perk for paying in bitcoin?” Mizrachi mused. “You’d get to go faster.” Under Mizrachi, Panama City passed a bill that allows residents to pay for taxes, parking tickets, permits, and other fees with bitcoin BTC, ether ETH and some stablecoins. Four years ago, at Bitcoin 2021, Nayib Bukele, the leader of Panama’s central American neighbor El Salvador, announced that his country would begin accepting bitcoin as legal tender.

2025-05-29T20:20:44.000Z,"97% of the U.S. government's $20.9B crypto reserve is in Bitcoin","The U.S. crypto reserves have been revealed to be 97% made up of Bitcoin, with Ethereum and stablecoins making up the remaining 3%. New data has shown that Bitcoin (BTC) makes up an overwhelming 97% of the United States’ newly centralized $20.9B cryptocurrency reserve . Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA), tokens that President Trump included in his strategic crypto reserve announcement, were noticeably missing from the reserve despite the earlier hype caused by the president’s initial pronouncements. These numbers, provided by blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, have given the public clarity as to what is inside of the U.S. government’s vaults following Trump’s executive order in March to formally create a national crypto reserve strategy. US crypto reserves revealed Though the Trump administration has not gone public with the official numbers, the data reviewed by The Washington Post indicates that the lion’s share of the United States’ seized and stored crypto is in Bitcoin — nearly $20.4B of the total. This concentration on Bitcoin sharply contrasts with the expectations Trump raised with his earlier statements. In a post on Truth Social made on March 2, the president name-dropped XRP, SOL, and ADA, consequently causing the value of those coins to spike, but now those same coins are absent from the actual reserve holdings. President Trump’s executive order created two new digital financial entities, the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile. The Bitcoin Reserve is essentially a digital Fort Knox meant to treat BTC like “digital gold,” according to Trump. The Digital Asset Stockpile, on the other hand, is a mix of whatever other crypto the government happens to seize, so its composition is unplanned and left to chance. Because the assets in both pools are primarily made up of cryptocurrency confiscated in civil or criminal proceedings, the government’s holdings reflect the coins most commonly involved in illicit activities, not necessarily the coins with the highest reputational value or the strongest developer communities As such, Bitcoin is overwhelmingly leading the reserve, followed by a smaller assortment of coins including Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT), Chainlink (LINK), WBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin), BNB (Binance Coin), DAI, UNI, TRX, and USDC, among others Stablecoins and wrapped tokens feature heavily in the treasury, while XRP, ADA, and SOL didn’t even make the top 20. Chainalysis suggests the current reserve figure is likely underestimating the full scope of government holdings, as the official audit and accounting process is still ongoing. The $20.9B estimate already places the U.S. government’s crypto assets just under the $25B value of the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve and well above its outdated gold reserve valuation, which would top $850B at current prices. Industry reaction to the report Previously, cryptocurrencies that were seized by agencies like the IRS or FBI were often sold off or returned to victims. Now, under Trump’s directive, they’re being stored as strategic assets much like one would oil or gold. The rate of lawsuits and regulatory probes has slowed under Trump’s administration, and crypto firms are now finding a friendlier environment to grow. But not everyone is thrilled by the reserve. Ethereum’s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, warned in a Washington Post interview that government involvement in crypto risks “violating crypto’s original mission of decentralization and openness.” Similarly, an NYU professor and crypto consultant, Austin Campbell, has called the reserve a potential contradiction to crypto’s core values. “Bitcoiners used to be about freedom from sovereign interference,” he said. “Now they’re cheering for a national stockpile?” Campbell also pointed out that the government could put the seized assets to better use, addressing the national debt or improving social programs. “Reserves make sense when you’re running a surplus,” he said. “Right now, they just make headlines.” Despite the criticism, states like New Hampshire and Arizona have passed legislation to create their own crypto stockpiles. Others, like Florida and Wyoming , opted not to create their own reserves due to their concerns about the volatility of cryptocurrencies.

In a post on social media, Drake described Bitcoin's proof-of-work (PoW) system as unsustainable and dangerous. Drake noted that Bitcoin transaction fees are at their lowest level in the last 13 years, and that daily transaction fees have dropped below 10 BTC. He said that although block rewards decrease after halving periods, the income from transaction fees still remains at 1%. “Low fees = low security budget = low security,” said Drake, arguing that Bitcoin’s security model is broken and this poses a systemic risk to the entire crypto ecosystem. Drake also criticized Bitcoin's 21 million supply limit, saying that this structure sabotages itself in the long run. He stated that if miners were to be supported only by transaction fees, revenues would decrease 100 times and even 1% of the existing mining infrastructure could take over Bitcoin with a 51% attack. Related News: BREAKING: Coinbase Futures Lists Highly Anticipated Altcoin - It Was Only a Matter of Time Unless transaction fees miraculously increase by 100 times, there are only two potential solutions for Bitcoin to survive, Drake said: Removal of the 21 million supply limit and introduction of an additional issuance mechanism called “tail issuance”. Switching to proof-of-stake (PoS) system. However, he noted that both of these suggestions are difficult to gain cultural acceptance within the Bitcoin community. Moreover, he stated that the “tail issuance” model will only work proactively, and will not work once Bitcoin is attacked. Drake also stated that projects such as Lightning Network, Ordinals, Stacks, and Liquid only provide short-term transaction fee increases, but long-term sustainability cannot be achieved. Drake also evaluated recent projects such as BitVM, and stated that such technologies may be vulnerable to 51% attacks, and therefore are far from being a solution. Drake's final message was clear: “Bitcoin’s PoW model is not sustainable. The math is against this system. If a fix is not made, at some point this system will break.” *This is not investment advice.

In a new strategy session, crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 789,600 followers on the social media platform X that it appears as if the layer-2 scaling solution Arbitrum ( ARB ) is primed to rise over the next 1-2 months. “The bullish divergence on ARB remains to be valid as it starts to make higher lows and higher highs. One to watch, and as we have this higher timeframe bullish divergence, it’s a good indicator that this one will do well in the coming 1-2 months.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X ARB is trading for $0.411 at time of writing, a 1.8% increase on the day. Moving on to the crypto king, the analyst says that he ultimately believes BTC will slowly grind upwards to a new all-time high (ATH). However, he notes that if it were to lose support at $107,000, it could see a sharp correction. “Level by level, Bitcoin continues to grind upwards. I think that we’ll continue to grind towards new ATHs, however, if this green block (support) is lost, you’ll see fast wicks occur. Quite standard, corrections are going to be volatile and with deep wicks as people tend to jump back into the asset in a fast manner. When can we expect one? If the level at $107,000 is lost.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X BTC is trading for $107,249 at time of writing, a marginal decrease on the day. Concluding his analysis with layer-1 blockchain and smart contract platform Sui Network, the trader says it’s recovering nicely after the FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) surrounding it after it got hacked to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars earlier this month. “SUI is strongly coming back after some FUD surrounding the Cetus exploit. The TVL (total value locked) has already bounced up with $300 million and is back to $1.8 billion TVL. I think that SUI remains to be a strong horse in the race of adoption and the stabilization on price proves this. Additionally, it’s outperforming Solana and I think that this will continue to be the case in the next 12-24 months. Just a normal consolidation.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X SUI is trading for $3.58 at time of writing, a marginal increase on the day.

2025-05-29T19:51:24.000Z,"Top 7 Best Long-Term Cryptos to Invest in for 2025","The world of cryptocurrency in 2025 is a combination of innovation, instability, and potential. Gone are those days when cryptocurrencies were considered a passing trend; today, they're at the heart of international finance and technology. For investors, the question is no longer whether to invest in cryptocurrency, but which coins have the staying power to weather market fluctuations and thrive in the years to come. Let's take a narrative journey through seven outstanding cryptocurrencies that the pundits and market trends suggest are best positioned for long-term strength and appreciation. Bitcoin (BTC — The Digital Gold Standard Bitcoin remains the unrivaled monarch of the cryptocurrency realm. As the pioneer and most recognizable cryptocurrency, it has endured regulatory crackdowns, market meltdowns, and incessant proclamations of its demise—only to emerge stronger each time. In 2025, Bitcoin's position as ”digital gold” is more concrete than ever, with institutional investors, sovereign wealth funds, and even governments holding BTC in their reserves. Market Cap: Over $2 trillion Price (May 2025): Around $109,000 Bitcoin's capped supply ensures scarcity, and its decentralized nature ensures security and transparency. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs and wider adoption as an inflation hedge have only fortified it. For a base asset in a crypto portfolio, Bitcoin is still the gold standard. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum transformed the blockchain ecosystem by enabling smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi), and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Its transition to Ethereum 2.0, via proof-of-stake and Layer 2 scaling solutions, has addressed the majority of the past issues like high fees and slow transactions. Market Cap: Over $300 billion Price (May 2025): Around $2,570 Ethereum's robust developer ecosystem and relentless innovation keep it at the forefront of blockchain technology. As more use cases are built on its network and institutional adoption increases, Ethereum's long-term future looks brighter than ever. Solana (SOL) Solana has become renowned for ultra-fast transactions and extremely low fees, making it a favorite among developers and users alike. Its ecosystem is vibrant, attracting projects from DeFi, NFTs, and even gaming. Market Cap: Over $90 billion Price (May 2025): Around $177–$370 (with predictions as high as $515) Solana's technological capabilities and active community have positioned it as one of Ethereum's largest competitors. As the network continues to expand and attract new users, Solana's future as a top blockchain looks increasingly guaranteed. Binance Coin (BNB) Binance Coin is the lifeblood of the Binance ecosystem, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB is used for trading fee discounts, token launches, and payments on Binance's growing array of products and services. Market Cap: Over $90 billion Price (May 2025): Around $673 Regular “burns” of BNB tokens reduce supply, potentially increasing value over time. Despite facing regulatory challenges, Binance’s global reach and innovation keep BNB in high demand, making it a compelling choice for long-term investors. XRP (Ripple) XRP is the power behind the Ripple network, which was developed for fast and cheap cross-border payments. Now that its long legal battle with the SEC has been resolved, XRP is returning to form, especially as banks and financial institutions seek efficient ways of moving money across borders. Market Cap: Over $130 billion Price (May 2025): Around $2.33–$2.34 (with bullish predictions up to $10) Ripple's partnerships and attempt to tokenize real-world assets could send XRP into massive demand. Regulatory clarity has removed a significant obstacle, clearing the way for broader adoption and growth. Dogecoin (DOGE) What started out as an internet joke has evolved into a cultural and financial phenomenon. Dogecoin's loyal community, celebrity endorsements, and increasing usage for payments have enabled it to remain in the game in a market filled with competition. Market Cap: Over $30 billion Price (May 2025): Around $0.23 While Dogecoin is more speculative than some of its rivals, its quirky mix of humor, community, and growing utility gives it surprising longevity. For those willing to take on some risk, Dogecoin offers entertainment value and potential upside. Cardano (ADA) Cardano takes a scientific, peer-reviewed approach to blockchain development that emphasizes scalability, sustainability, and interoperability. Its slow and steady approach may be lagging some rivals, but it has built a record of reliability and forward thinking. Market Cap: Over $27 billion Price (May 2025): Around $0.77 Through ongoing development and partnerships, especially in emerging markets, Cardano is laying the groundwork for mainstream acceptance. Its commitment to academic rigor and practical solutions places it in a strong position for long-term growth. Conclusion As the cryptocurrency market matures in 2025, these seven cryptocurrencies — Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Binance Coin, XRP, Dogecoin, and Cardano stand out for their survival, innovation, and prospects of long-term gains. Each has its own story: from Bitcoin as digital gold to Cardano's scientific approach. Building a long-term crypto portfolio is more about identifying projects with actual real-world use cases, good communities, and the ability to pivot and thrive. All of these cryptocurrencies have those qualities and are certainly worth considering as the revolution in digital assets continues.

2025-05-29T19:37:10.000Z,"SEC Task Force Chief Says Crypto Traders Need to be Growups, Not Cry to Government","LAS VEGAS, Nevada — You shouldn't be a crypto libertarian that comes crying for government help when things go badly, according to Hester Peirce, the chief of the crypto task force at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \""I do think that sometimes, when something bad happens in this space, people who are remarkably free thinkers, libertarian-minded people, come in and say, ‘Where was the government? Why weren’t you protecting me? Hey, Crypto Mom, where’s my bailout?'\"" she told a crowd at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas, referring to her industry nickname. \""C'mon, let's have some consistency,” Peirce continued. “Yes, you should have freedom to make your own choices, and when it goes wrong, pick yourself up, dust yourself off, learn from it and do better next time. And that is the best way to move forward.\"" Since Republicans took control of the SEC, including Commissioner Peirce and newly arrived Chairman Paul Atkins, they've worked to issue statements and directives to carve out corners of the crypto sector from the agency's jurisdiction, including memecoins, some crypto mining and certain stablecoins. But there remains a pathway of policymaking the agency has started down while lawmakers in Congress are also working on sweeping new laws that could further set its agenda. The SEC has a lot of current authority to clarify the nature of crypto securities, Peirce said, but if people want a U.S. federal regulator for retail trading, they'll need Congress to produce legislation to make that happen. She put the question to her audience on Thursday, whether they wanted a federal crypto regulator. \""NO!\"" somebody shouted. “There you go, you have one answer,” she quipped. Peirce said that most crypto tokens aren't themselves securities, and as a result, trading platforms handling them shouldn't need to register with the SEC unless they're also touching the securities world. Asked about memecoins, which an agency statement said are outside its enforcement interests, Peirce offered it as an example of where investors need to look out for themselves. “Be an adult,\"" she said. \""If you want to engage in speculation, go for it. But if something goes wrong, don’t come complaining to the government about it.” And as for the trend of companies putting digital assets into their own treasuries, she said public companies are entitled to do what they like — as long as they're properly disclosing it. \""They can make their own decisions,\"" she said. \""I'm agnostic.\""",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/05/29/sec-task-force-chief-says-crypto-traders-need-to-be-growups-not-cry-to-government,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING","Policy|Hester Peirce|SEC|News",cryptocompare

Through his official X account, the president announced that the land will be tokenized on the Solana (SOL) network using only the country’s token dubbed Central African Republic Meme ($CAR). According to the presidential decree, the segregated land in the country will only be accessible via CAR token beginning June 2025. Consequently, the CAR memecoin has gained significant attention from speculative crypto traders. “Starting June, land concessions will be accessible online using $CAR, directly on Solana. A new era of access and transparency begins,” Touadéra noted . Central African Republic Meme (CAR) Defies Crypto Bearish Sentiment The CAR memecoin has largely decoupled from the wider altcoin market, which has been trapped in bearish sentiment in the past two weeks. According to Coimpedia’s crypto oracles, CAR price surged over 17 percent following the announcement to trade about $0.053 on Thursday, May 29 during the mid-North American trading session. The small-cap memecoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $54 million and a 24-hour average trading volume of around $9.2 million, has surged more than 300 percent in the past two months. As a result, CAR price has achieved a significant bullish momentum to possibly pump towards its all-time high (ATH) of about 77 cents, about 93 percent. Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) price led the wider altcoin market in mild correction, thus the total crypto market cap dropped by 3 percent in the past 24 hours to hover about $3.5 trillion.

According to information obtained by Crypto in America, the text of the bill will be introduced in a “pro forma” session, a short-term, procedural session held while the House is in recess. While these sessions do not typically involve legislative activity, they can be used to formally introduce bills when lawmakers are outside of Washington. The updated text follows a draft bill shared earlier this month by a coalition of prominent House Republicans, including Financial Services Committee Chairman French Hill, Agriculture Committee Chairman GT Thompson, Digital Assets Subcommittee Chairman Bryan Steil and Agriculture Committee Digital Assets Subcommittee Chairman Dusty Johnson. Related News: BREAKING: Coinbase Futures Lists Highly Anticipated Altcoin - It Was Only a Matter of Time The bill, which is expected to set the basic framework for regulating and trading the American digital asset market, represents the next step in a comprehensive regulatory effort by the White House and Republicans.

The House Financial Services Committee is scheduled to hold a hearing on the updated text on June 4 titled “American Innovation and the Future of Digital Assets: From Blueprint to an Operational Framework.” A hearing is planned for June 10 to consider various bills, but it is not yet clear whether this bill will be included in that process.

2025-05-29T19:30:22.000Z,"BlackRock IBIT’s Stunning $4B Inflow Streak Boosts Bitcoin ETF Market","BitcoinWorld BlackRock IBIT’s Stunning $4B Inflow Streak Boosts Bitcoin ETF Market Get ready for some impressive numbers! BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF , known by its ticker IBIT , has been on an absolute tear lately, attracting billions in investor capital. This isn’t just good news for BlackRock; it’s a significant indicator of growing confidence in the crypto market, especially from larger, more traditional investors. Decoding the Massive Crypto ETF Inflows Led by IBIT Over a recent 10-day period, BlackRock IBIT spearheaded a strong wave of investment into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs. The fund alone recorded a staggering $4.09 billion in net inflows during this timeframe. This massive figure highlights the strong demand for easy, regulated access to Bitcoin exposure, and BlackRock’s offering is clearly a top choice. The significance of this inflow goes beyond just the dollar amount. It represents sustained interest and conviction from investors pouring money into these regulated vehicles. The Remarkable Streak: 33 Days of No Outflows for BlackRock IBIT Perhaps even more telling than the large inflow sum is BlackRock IBIT ‘s incredible streak. Since April 9, the fund has not experienced a single day of net outflows. That’s 33 consecutive trading days where more money went into IBIT than came out. This kind of sustained positive flow is rare and speaks volumes about investor confidence in both the fund and the underlying asset, Bitcoin. Let’s break down what this streak means: Investor Confidence: It suggests investors who buy IBIT are holding onto their positions, indicating a belief in long-term growth. Market Stability: Consistent inflows provide a steady buying pressure on Bitcoin, contributing to market stability. Fund Performance: A lack of outflows often correlates with strong performance or positive market sentiment surrounding the asset. This 33-day run is a powerful testament to the fund’s appeal and the current bullish sentiment driving institutional Bitcoin adoption . IBIT’s Growing Stature and Contribution to Institutional Bitcoin Adoption The success of BlackRock IBIT isn’t just about daily numbers; it’s about establishing itself as a major player in the financial landscape. With its assets under management (AUM) now reaching an impressive $72 billion, IBIT ranks among the top five ETFs in terms of year-to-date inflows across the entire ETF market, not just crypto. This is a huge win for the digital asset space, demonstrating that Bitcoin ETFs can compete with established, traditional investment products. Consider the implications of an ETF reaching this size and ranking: Caption: Visual representation of significant inflows into BlackRock’s IBIT ETF. This level of AUM and consistent inflow signals that significant institutional capital is finding its way into Bitcoin through regulated channels. This trend is a cornerstone of the ongoing narrative around institutional Bitcoin adoption . A Look at Daily Dominance: May 28th’s Inflow Snapshot On a specific day, May 28th, BlackRock IBIT ‘s dominance was particularly evident. While other U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw either outflows or flat activity, IBIT attracted a substantial $481 million in inflows. This wasn’t just the largest inflow of the day; it was the only net inflow among all the competing Bitcoin ETFs reported on that day. This highlights BlackRock’s leading position and the strong preference many investors have for their offering. This kind of daily performance underscores the liquidity and investor trust concentrated in the BlackRock IBIT fund. Beyond Bitcoin: BlackRock’s Foray into the Ethereum ETF Market It’s not just Bitcoin seeing action from BlackRock. Their spot Ethereum ETF , ticker ETHA, is also showing positive momentum. ETHA extended its own positive inflow run to eight consecutive days, with cumulative inflows nearing $400 million. While smaller than IBIT’s numbers, this indicates growing interest in Ethereum exposure via ETFs as well, especially following recent regulatory developments. The success of both IBIT and ETHA suggests BlackRock is becoming a dominant force in the crypto ETF landscape, offering investors regulated pathways into the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. What These Crypto ETF Inflows Mean for the Market The sustained and significant inflows into funds like BlackRock IBIT and ETHA have several key implications for the broader cryptocurrency market: Benefits: Increased Legitimacy: Large inflows from institutional players via ETFs add significant legitimacy to Bitcoin and Ethereum as asset classes. Price Support: Consistent buying pressure from these funds can provide underlying support for the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Accessibility: ETFs make it easier for traditional investors and institutions to gain exposure without directly handling the complexities of buying and storing crypto. Market Infrastructure: The success of these ETFs encourages further development of robust, regulated financial infrastructure around crypto. Challenges: Market Volatility: While inflows can support prices, potential large outflows in the future could also contribute to volatility. Concentration Risk: A significant portion of institutional exposure being concentrated in a few large funds like IBIT could create risks if those funds face specific issues. Regulatory Uncertainty: While spot Bitcoin ETFs are approved, the regulatory landscape for other crypto assets and the broader market remains dynamic. Actionable Insights: Watch ETF Flows: Monitoring ETF inflow and outflow data provides valuable insight into institutional and large-scale investor sentiment. Consider Diversification: While ETFs offer exposure, understanding the underlying assets and diversifying investment approaches remains crucial. Stay Informed: Keep track of regulatory developments and market trends influencing the ETF space. Conclusion: BlackRock’s Dominance Signals a Maturing Market The impressive performance of BlackRock IBIT , highlighted by its $4.09 billion net inflow over 10 days and its remarkable 33-day streak without outflows, underscores a significant shift in the investment world. Coupled with the positive trend in their Ethereum ETF , BlackRock is clearly at the forefront of bringing digital assets into mainstream finance. These substantial crypto ETF inflows are not just numbers; they represent increasing institutional Bitcoin adoption and a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies as legitimate assets worthy of significant capital allocation. As these funds continue to grow, they are likely to play an ever-larger role in shaping the future of the crypto market.

2025-05-29T19:30:00.000Z,"Can Bitcoin Hold Its Ground Above Former Highs? BTC Price Outlook","Summary Prices recently broke out of the steep ascending trendline that led Bitcoin to its most recent all-time highs. Bitcoin has been on a stellar rise since April 2025 lows, coming from a low of $74,518 to new record highs. There is the potential for a bull flag, which would materialize if we break above the downwards trendline. By Elior Manier Bitcoin hasn't seen any concrete move since last week's all-time highs were hit. Consolidation above all-time highs is typically viewed as a strong signal for potential continuation. It indicates that the market is absorbing higher price levels, with increased trading activity reinforcing acceptance of the new range and paving the way for further upside. Although this acceptance is conditional to prices actually maintaining their newly formed range. Prices recently broke out of the steep ascending trendline that led Bitcoin to its most recent all-time highs, marked at $ 112,030 on Thursday May 22nd. Dive into a two timeframe technical analysis for the leading cryptocurrency. BTC Technical Analysis Bitcoin 4H Chart Bitcoin 4H Chart Bitcoin has been on a stellar rise since April 2025 lows, coming from a low of $74,518 to new record highs. This rise was accompanied by the 4H MA 50 that kept underpinning prices - that same Moving Average just turned from support to resistance. We are still maintaining around the ATH range situated between $106,500 to $112,030. A break below the recent trendline may hint at a correction, though that would have to be accompanied by some selling momentum, which is not present in current price action. Some levels to watch for: Support Levels 106,350 to 107,500 - Immediate Support Zone 102,000 to 104,000 97,000 to 98,500 - Confluence with MA 200 92,000 to 93,500 Resistance Levels 108,600 - Mid-way between MA 20 and 50 110,500 to 112,030 - Key ATH Resistance 115,000 to 117,000 - Fibonacci Extension potential resistance Let's take a further look with the 1H chart. Bitcoin 1H Chart BTC 1H Chart, May 29 2025. Source: TradingView A deeper look into shorter timeframes allows monitoring what moves are building. We can observe that the down move from yesterday established the break below the steep uptrend from April Lows, and that a downwards trendline has been formed as an immediate resistance. There is the potential for a Bull Flag which would materialize if we break above the downwards trendline and this is a possibility as long as we hold the aforementioned i mmediate support zone. Both the MA 50 and 200 are acting as resistance for now therefore prices would also have to break above.

2025-05-29T19:26:43.000Z,"Arkham Uncovers Strategy’s Bitcoin Stash Amid PoR Controversy","Blockchain analytics startup Arkham Intelligence has boldly tried to trace all the Bitcoin (BTC) owned by Michael Saylor’s company, Strategy. The on-chain analytics firm has identified 97% of Strategy’s massive Bitcoin stash . This follows Saylor’s recent comments regarding the company’s proof of reserve. The move has sparked fresh discussions on transparency in the crypto space. Arkham Brings Strategy’s Bitcoin Holdings Into the Light In a recent post on X, Arkham confirmed it has identified 97% of Strategy’s Bitcoin reserve. This includes a fresh acquisition of 53,833 BTC, worth about $5.75 billion. In total, Arkham says it has tracked 580,250 BTC, worth nearly $60 billion. The company believes it is the first to publicly trace these wallets and share them with the crypto community. These wallets were added to Arkham’s growing list of addresses linked to Strategy and its Chairman. Just a day before this, Arkham reported finding over 70,000 BTC purchased by the Virginia-based firm. These updates have strengthened the platform’s efforts to create a complete and public record of Strategy’s Bitcoin reserves. Pushing Toward Public Proof-of-Reserves In the post, Arkham says this is all part of its goal to build a fully transparent proof-of-reserve system. Its blockchain explorer shows that Strategy holds over 454,000 BTC in separate wallets, each address of which can be viewed individually. However, not all of Strategy’s Bitcoin is traceable. The on-chain analytics revealed that 107,000 BTC is kept in a shared custody account with Fidelity Investments. These coins do not appear on Arkham’s explorer because they are mixed with other clients’ funds. Nevertheless, with 97% now accounted for, Arkham is closer than ever to revealing Strategy’s full Bitcoin stash. Saylor Says Proof-of-Reserve is Risky, Critics Fire Back Meanwhile, before Arkham’s latest update, Michael Saylor had warned that proof-of-reserve . He believes that sharing wallet addresses publicly could create safety risks, like hacking or cyberattacks. However, not everyone agrees with him. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, responded to Saylor’s comments with a different view. In an X post , Geraci said that if companies like Bybit and Binance can reveal their wallet addresses, then Strategy should be able to do the same. He pointed out that Bitcoin was built on the idea of transparency. In his words, hiding information goes against what crypto is supposed to stand for. This difference in views has caused an uproar in the crypto community.

2025-05-29T19:25:58.000Z,"How To Accept Cryptocurrency on Your Website – Step-by-Step Instructions","Cryptocurrency is no longer a niche technology – it is reshaping global finance and digital commerce. By December 2024 , the number of crypto users reached 659 million, and experts predict a 30% increase in 2025, according to Statista . This rapid adoption is driven by both economic necessity and financial innovation. India, Indonesia, Nigeria, the United States and Vietnam are leading the shift. In emerging markets, crypto provides a hedge against inflation, simplifies remittances and expands financial access. In the US, institutional investments and evolving regulations fuel growth. Peer-to-peer trading in Nigeria and Vietnam, blockchain gaming in Vietnam and Indonesia and fintech expansion in India and Indonesia are further accelerating adoption. As crypto adoption accelerates, businesses must adapt to stay competitive. Accepting crypto payments has become crucial for companies seeking faster, more cost-effective solutions. The benefits of accepting crypto payments for businesses include the following. Lower transaction fees Faster payment processing, ensuring quicker settlements and cash flow Global reach, allowing businesses to engage with customers almost anywhere in the world Enhanced security with blockchain technology, reducing fraud and chargebacks With the rise of modern crypto payment solutions like CryptoProcessing by CoinsPaid, businesses can now integrate crypto payments seamlessly and future-proof their operations. Adopting crypto today will help businesses maintain a competitive edge as digital currencies become the standard. You might be wondering – how can I accept cryptocurrency on my website? This guide will walk you through the process and explain everything you need to know. Why accept cryptocurrency as a payment method Before diving into how to integrate crypto payments, let’s first explore why businesses should consider them. Cryptocurrency is no longer a niche trend – it’s a strategic advantage that helps companies cut costs, expand globally and increase security. Let’s take a look at crypto versus traditional payments. Lower operational costs Traditional payment providers like credit card processors and PayPal charge between 1.5% to 8% per transaction, plus fixed fees. For high-volume businesses, these costs add up fast. In contrast, crypto transactions typically cost less than 1.5%, saving companies significant amounts on payment processing. No chargeback risks Chargebacks are a major issue in e-commerce, leading to lost revenue when customers dispute payments. Cryptocurrency transactions cannot be reversed, eliminating chargeback fraud. However, merchants can still offer manual refunds, ensuring flexibility for customer service. No geographic restrictions Many traditional payment gateways don’t support international transactions or impose high fees and currency conversion costs. Crypto payments are borderless, allowing businesses to accept payments from customers internationally without intermediaries. Faster transactions Bank transfers and card payments can take one to three business days to settle, and cross-border transactions can be even slower due to exchange rate fluctuations. Crypto payments settle in minutes or even seconds. For example, CryptoProcessing by CoinsPaid completes transactions in under 60 seconds, ensuring seamless cash flow. How to choose the right crypto payment solution Now that you understand the benefits of crypto payment gateways for businesses, it’s time to choose the right solution for your needs. With so many options available, selecting the best one requires careful consideration. Here are the key factors to keep in mind. Check if the gateway supports the digital assets your customers use, including Bitcoin, Ethereum and stablecoins. If your business needs fast conversion to USD, EUR, or other fiat currencies specified in the region, choose a gateway that offers this service. Some gateways cater to e-commerce, SaaS, high-risk industries and service-based businesses. Select one that fits your sector. Reviews on the site will help to check it. Look for API compatibility, plugins for Shopify, WooCommerce or invoicing tools for easy setup. Compare transaction fees, withdrawal options and settlement times to optimize costs. Choose a provider with KYC/AML policies, fraud protection and strong encryption to ensure safe transactions. Want to know the best part? CryptoProcessing by CoinsPaid is a good choice. It stands out by offering low transaction fees of around one percent, multi-currency support and seamless integration with various platforms. It provides near-instant payments and efficient fund management for businesses of all sizes.

2025-05-29T19:15:00.000Z,"Pakistan Unveils Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and National Wallet at Bitcoin 2025 Event","Pakistan allocated 2,000MW to support national Bitcoin mining and AI data centers. Pakistan unveils sovereign Bitcoin wallet to hold long-term, non-tradable BTC reserves. Pakistan formed the Digital Assets Authority to regulate blockchain and crypto finance. At the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas on May 28, Bilal Bin Saqib, head of Pakistan’s National Crypto Council, declared that the country has established a Bitcoin reserve. By making this decision, the government is shifting its previous stance, where officials had rejected cryptocurrency as a legal option. Speaking at the event, Saqib revealed the establishment of Pakistan’s first sovereign Bitcoin wallet. He clarified that the assets would not be used for speculation or trading. “We will be holding these bitcoins and we will never, ever sell them,” he stated during the keynote address. This strategic reserve mirrors the United States’ recent initiative under the Trump administration. In March, Trump proposed the U.S. “Digital Fort Knox” plan, which would utilize seized assets to establish a government-controlled Bitcoin treasury.

2025-05-29T19:10:31.000Z,"Ethereum Price Surges: ETH Outperforms Bitcoin Amid Rising Investor Optimism","BitcoinWorld Ethereum Price Surges: ETH Outperforms Bitcoin Amid Rising Investor Optimism In a notable shift within the digital asset space, the Ethereum price has recently shown significant strength, outpacing its larger counterpart, Bitcoin. This performance divergence is capturing the attention of participants across the entire crypto market, signaling potentially evolving dynamics. Recent Price Action: Why is Ethereum Leading? Recent data highlights a compelling trend: Ethereum (ETH) has gained over 3% in the past 24 hours, while Bitcoin price (BTC) experienced a slight decline of nearly 1%. This divergence, as reported by sources like U.Today, suggests that capital flows and sentiment might be favoring altcoins, particularly Ethereum, in the current market phase. Several factors appear to be contributing to this momentum shift: Increased Trading Volume: Higher volume often indicates stronger conviction behind price movements. A surge in ETH trading volume suggests robust demand. Positive Sentiment: Investor optimism surrounding Ethereum’s ecosystem developments, potential future upgrades, and anticipation around regulatory clarity (like potential spot ETH ETFs) is building. Network Activity: Continued growth and innovation on the Ethereum network, including advancements in Layer 2 scaling solutions and decentralized finance (DeFi), maintain fundamental interest. This combination of technical indicators and fundamental drivers provides a fertile ground for ETH’s recent ascent. Exploring the Technical Outlook for Ethereum Price Analysts are closely monitoring key technical levels for Ethereum. A significant focus is placed on breaking above the $3,000 mark. This level is seen as a psychological and technical resistance point. A sustained move past $3,000 could confirm strong bullish momentum. Should this upward trajectory continue, the next potential targets for the Ethereum price are eyed in the $4,500 to $5,300 range. This range represents historical price highs and significant technical resistance zones. Reaching these levels would require continued strong market interest and a sustained uptrend, potentially fueled by positive news flow or broader market tailwinds. Here’s a look at the potential path: Current State Key Resistance Next Target Range Supporting Factors Outperforming BTC $3,000 $4,500 – $5,300 Rising Volume, Positive Sentiment, Ecosystem Growth ETH vs BTC: Understanding the Dynamic The relationship between Ethereum and Bitcoin is often described as a dance. While Bitcoin typically leads market cycles as the primary store of value and the largest digital asset by market capitalization, Ethereum, with its smart contract capabilities, fuels the broader decentralized application ecosystem. Periods where ETH outperforms BTC often occur when investor optimism shifts towards the potential of decentralized applications, NFTs, DeFi, and other innovations built on Ethereum. This can be seen as a ‘risk-on’ signal within the crypto market, where participants are more willing to invest in assets perceived as having higher growth potential than Bitcoin’s more established ‘digital gold’ narrative. The recent divergence highlights this potential shift, where the market is perhaps placing a higher immediate value on Ethereum’s utility and growth prospects compared to Bitcoin’s current consolidation phase. What Does This Performance Mean for the Crypto Market? Ethereum’s strength often acts as a bellwether for the broader altcoin market. When Ethereum price performs well against Bitcoin, it can signal the start or continuation of an ‘altseason,’ a period where many altcoins experience significant gains. This is because Ethereum is the foundational layer for many decentralized projects. Its success and liquidity tend to benefit tokens within its ecosystem. Therefore, ETH outperformance can be interpreted as a positive sign for overall crypto market health and a potential precursor for gains in smaller cap altcoins. Conversely, if Ethereum’s rally falters while Bitcoin remains stable or declines, it might suggest that the broader altcoin rally lacks sustainability. Monitoring the ETH vs BTC chart is crucial for understanding market sentiment beyond just Bitcoin. Putting Bitcoin Price Performance in Context While Ethereum has been gaining relative strength, it is important to view Bitcoin price performance within its own context. Bitcoin recently achieved significant milestones, including new all-time highs following the approval of spot BTC ETFs in the United States. After such strong rallies, periods of consolidation or slight pullbacks are normal and can be healthy for the market structure. Bitcoin’s recent dip of 1% is not necessarily a sign of weakness, but potentially a temporary pause or profit-taking phase after its own impressive run. The fact that Ethereum is rising while Bitcoin is consolidating could indicate a rotation of capital from BTC into ETH and other altcoins, driven by renewed investor optimism for higher-beta assets. Actionable Insights for Investors For those participating in the crypto market, observing the ETH vs BTC dynamic offers valuable insights. Here are some points to consider: Monitor Key Levels: Watch Ethereum’s interaction with the $3,000 level. A convincing break and hold above it could signal further upside. Assess Risk Tolerance: While ETH offers potential for higher gains during altcoin cycles, it can also experience higher volatility than Bitcoin. Diversification: Consider how ETH fits into your overall portfolio strategy. Diversification across different assets remains a key principle. Stay Informed: Keep track of Ethereum network developments, regulatory news, and overall market sentiment influencing both Ethereum price and Bitcoin price. The current environment presents potential opportunities, but it is essential to approach the market with a clear strategy and awareness of the inherent risks. Future Prospects and Challenges Can Ethereum sustain its outperformance? The answer depends on a confluence of factors. Continued network innovation, successful implementation of future upgrades, positive regulatory developments (especially regarding ETFs), and sustained investor optimism are crucial drivers. Challenges include potential market-wide corrections, regulatory headwinds, competition from other blockchain platforms, and execution risks related to network development. However, the current technical setup and positive sentiment provide a strong foundation for potential continued upside. Conclusion: A Potential Shift in the Crypto Landscape? Ethereum’s recent outperformance against Bitcoin is a significant development in the crypto market. Driven by rising trading volume and palpable investor optimism, the Ethereum price is targeting key resistance levels, with analysts eyeing potential moves towards the $4,500-$5,300 range. While Bitcoin price takes a pause, the strength shown in the ETH vs BTC pairing suggests growing confidence in Ethereum’s ecosystem and future prospects. As the market evolves, keeping a close watch on these dynamics will be key for navigating the opportunities and challenges ahead.

2025-05-29T19:05:13.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Adam Back Foresees Unlocking $1M Future","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Prediction: Adam Back Foresees Unlocking $1M Future Get ready for a bold forecast that’s stirring excitement in the crypto world! Adam Back, the well-known CEO of blockchain firm Blockstream and a staunch advocate for Bitcoin (BTC), has made a significant Bitcoin price prediction . He believes the world’s leading cryptocurrency has the potential to hit an astonishing $1M Bitcoin within the next five years. This isn’t just a speculative guess; Back bases his projection on fundamental shifts he’s observing in the market, particularly the increasing interest from major financial players. What is Adam Back’s Bold BTC Price Forecast? Speaking at the recent Bitcoin 2025 conference, Adam Back laid out his optimistic vision for the future value of BTC. His core message? The unique properties of Bitcoin as ‘hard money’ are beginning to resonate deeply within traditional finance. This growing understanding is paving the way for significant Institutional adoption , which Back sees as the primary catalyst for a massive surge in the BTC price . Here’s the breakdown of his prediction: Target Price: $1,000,000 USD Timeline: Within the next five years (by roughly 2029/2030) Primary Driver: Accelerated institutional adoption Underlying Reason: Bitcoin’s status as digital ‘hard money’ While a $1M Bitcoin price might sound ambitious, Back argues that the foundational shift towards recognizing Bitcoin’s value proposition by large entities makes this trajectory plausible. How is Institutional Adoption Shaping the BTC Price Landscape? The concept of Institutional adoption refers to large financial institutions, corporations, and even governments adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets, offering Bitcoin products to clients, or building infrastructure around the asset. For years, Bitcoin was primarily a retail phenomenon, but this is changing rapidly. Adam Back highlighted that while interest is high, institutions are still in the early stages of commitment. He pointed to data from the BlackRock spot Bitcoin ETF as an example. According to Back, only about 33% of the BTC held within this massive fund is currently owned by institutional investors. The remaining portion is largely held by retail investors or entities not classified as traditional institutions. This data point is crucial because it suggests that the full weight of institutional capital has yet to enter the market. If just one-third of the current holdings in a major ETF are institutional, imagine the potential impact when that percentage grows significantly, or when more institutions allocate even a small portion of their vast portfolios to Bitcoin. Why Does ‘Hard Money’ Attract Big Players and Influence Bitcoin Price Prediction? A core part of Adam Back’s thesis, and a key factor influencing his Bitcoin price prediction , is Bitcoin’s nature as ‘hard money’. Unlike traditional fiat currencies that can be printed infinitely by central banks, leading to inflation and a loss of purchasing power, Bitcoin has a fixed supply cap of 21 million coins. This scarcity, combined with its decentralized nature and resistance to censorship, makes it an attractive store of value, particularly in times of economic uncertainty or rising inflation. Institutions, managing vast sums of capital, are increasingly looking for assets that can preserve wealth over the long term. Gold has traditionally filled this role, but Bitcoin offers unique advantages in the digital age: it’s easily divisible, portable across borders instantly, and verifiable on an immutable ledger. This ‘digital gold’ narrative is a powerful driver for institutional interest and, consequently, for the potential future BTC price . Challenges and Opportunities on the Path to $1M Bitcoin While the potential is clear, the road to a $1M Bitcoin isn’t without its hurdles. Adam Back acknowledged that institutions face various challenges before fully diving in: Regulatory Clarity: Uncertainty around global cryptocurrency regulations remains a significant barrier for many large, risk-averse institutions. Custody Solutions: Securely storing vast amounts of Bitcoin requires robust, institutional-grade custody solutions, which are still evolving. Internal Education and Approval: Getting buy-in from boards, compliance departments, and investment committees within large organizations can be a slow process. Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s historical price swings can be daunting for traditional portfolio managers accustomed to less volatile assets. However, the opportunities presented by increased Institutional adoption are immense. A broader institutional entry could lead to: Increased liquidity and market maturity. Greater mainstream acceptance and understanding of Bitcoin. Development of more sophisticated financial products and services around Bitcoin. Significant capital inflows that could dwarf previous retail-driven rallies, potentially validating the ambitious Bitcoin price prediction made by figures like Adam Back . What Does Adam Back’s Prediction Mean for You? Adam Back’s forecast of a potential $1M Bitcoin within five years serves as a powerful reminder of the long-term growth potential many see in this asset class. It underscores the belief that the current market structure, while influenced by retail, is on the cusp of a significant shift driven by larger players. For individual investors, this perspective highlights the importance of: Taking a long-term view when considering Bitcoin. Understanding the fundamental drivers of its value, such as scarcity and its role as digital hard money. Recognizing the potential impact of increasing Institutional adoption on future price movements. Doing your own research and considering your own risk tolerance before making investment decisions based on any single Bitcoin price prediction , no matter how prominent the source. While no prediction is guaranteed, the analysis provided by experienced figures like Adam Back offers valuable insight into the potential forces that could shape the future trajectory of the BTC price . Summary: The Road Ahead for BTC Price Adam Back’s projection of $1M Bitcoin within five years is a bold but calculated outlook rooted in the increasing recognition of Bitcoin’s ‘hard money’ properties and the anticipated surge in Institutional adoption . While institutions are not yet fully committed, their growing interest, evidenced by vehicles like the BlackRock ETF, suggests that significant capital inflows could be on the horizon. This potential influx, combined with Bitcoin’s inherent scarcity, forms the basis for Back’s optimistic Bitcoin price prediction . The coming years will reveal whether this wave of institutional capital is indeed the key to unlocking a future where the BTC price reaches unprecedented levels.

2025-05-29T19:02:46.000Z,"Key Indicator Signals Early Upside Despite Quiet Bitcoin (BTC) Market","Bitcoin reached a record high of almost $112,000 on May 22 and has remained relatively close to that mark ever since, keeping investors on edge for a potential breakout. Despite subdued market activity, the Bitcoin Combined Market Index (BCMI) indicates a shift in sentiment. Accumulation Signals As of May 29, 2025, the 7-day simple moving average (SMA) of the BCMI has rebounded sharply to around 0.6, which, according to CryptoQuant, suggests an early upside signal. In contrast, the 90-day SMA remains stable at approximately 0.45, reflecting a neutral zone and confirming that the market is not yet overheated. The BCMI, which blends key metrics such as MVRV, NUPL, SOPR, and the Fear & Greed Index, serves as a broader gauge of market mood. Thresholds highlight extremes, values below 0.15 point to macro bottoms, while those above 0.75 hint at potential tops. With profit-taking slowing and on-chain indicators improving, the index hints at a possible early accumulation phase. While broader participation remains cautious, the data suggests sentiment may be quietly turning. “The crowd is still waiting – but the signal is already flashing.” Further validating this behavior, Santiment’s latest analysis revealed a significant trend among mid-sized Bitcoin whales. The crypto analytics firm observed that wallets holding between 100-1,000 BTC have shown the strongest historical correlation to Bitcoin’s price movements over the past five years. In the last six weeks alone, this cohort has added 337 new wallets, collectively accumulating an additional 122,330 BTC . This sharp uptick in accumulation suggests growing confidence among seasoned investors and may signal a bullish undercurrent forming beneath the surface of current market conditions. “Pivot Zone” for Bitcoin Bitcoin could be facing another prolonged consolidation phase if fresh buying pressure does not emerge this week, according to on-chain analyst Willy Woo. In a recent update , Woo noted that while the broader market shows signs of strength, with his Risk Signal trending downward, which means buy-side liquidity is dominating, the short-term momentum is faltering. The strength of this bullish run from $75K to $112K is starting to break down, he warned. The next few days are crucial: a lack of follow-through from buyers may stall the rally and trap the market in sideways action. Woo raised concerns over latecomer speculators entering long positions while many holders sit on significant unrealized gains, as highlighted by the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR). If profit-taking intensifies without sufficient spot demand, the market could retreat or stall. Woo believes the outcome of this week’s spot market activity will likely shape Bitcoin’s direction for the next one to two months.

2025-05-29T19:01:40.000Z,"Russian Crypto Couple Rescued After $43,000 Bitcoin Kidnapping – Suspects Flee to UAE as Interpol Issues Red Notice","Key Takeaways: A Russian couple involved in crypto was kidnapped in Buenos Aires and held for ransom. The kidnappers demanded and received a $43,000 Bitcoin ransom from a third Russian national. The Argentine Federal Police are collaborating with Interpol to secure the suspects’ extradition. A young Russian couple involved in cryptocurrency was kidnapped and later rescued in Buenos Aires after a $43,000 ransom was paid in Bitcoin. The incident took place in the Palermo neighborhood on the night of May 23 and has prompted an international investigation. Russian Couple Held Hostage, Freed After Bitcoin Payment According to Argentine outlet La Nación , the couple had agreed to meet with two Russian citizens after a previous encounter at a local bar. They were invited to dinner at a rented apartment located at 1596 Ravignani Street, near the corner of Gorriti Street. A Russian couple operating a cryptocurrency business in Buenos Aires was kidnapped last week in their apartment by two Chechen suspects and held for a $43,000 digital currency ransom. The female victim called for help from the balcony, leading to a swift rescue by police. The… — Nehal (@nehalzzzz1) May 29, 2025 Investigators say the suspects were two Chechen men who had been staying in the apartment for two nights. Around 11 p.m., the 30-year-old female victim began shouting for help from the balcony in English. Her cries were heard by employees at a nearby restaurant, who alerted police. Responding officers from the city police arrived quickly and found the woman and her 27-year-old partner tied up inside the apartment. The victims told authorities that they had been kidnapped during the dinner meeting. Police say the suspects demanded a ransom in cryptocurrency. The $43,000 payment was made by another Russian citizen living in Partido de la Costa after a digital transfer was arranged with the kidnappers. The couple was released shortly after the payment. By the time police identified the suspects, both had already fled Argentina. The Argentine Federal Police (PFA) confirmed that they boarded a flight from Ezeiza International Airport to the United Arab Emirates within hours of the crime. Interpol has since issued red notices for both men. The case is now being handled by the Southern Anti-Kidnapping Department of the PFA, under the supervision of Federal Judge María Romilda Servini. The judge has issued international arrest warrants and is working with Interpol to secure extradition. If captured and returned to Argentina, the suspects face prison sentences ranging from 8 to 15 years. Authorities believe the victims’ involvement in cryptocurrency may have made them targets. A source close to the investigation said, “This wasn’t a random act. The attackers likely knew the couple had access to digital assets and used that to their advantage.” The investigation is ongoing as Argentine officials coordinate with international law enforcement to locate and detain the fugitives. Wave of Crypto-Linked Kidnappings Escalates Across Europe and the U.S. as Executives Become Targets The kidnapping of the Russian crypto couple is part of a broader and growing trend, as there is a surge in violent crimes targeting crypto figures globally. In January, David Balland, co-founder of Ledger, was kidnapped along with his wife in central France. Attackers reportedly severed Balland’s finger and sent a video to his business partner, demanding a ransom. Also, just a few weeks ago, French police launched a night raid to free the father of a crypto entrepreneur, who had been held in an Airbnb for two days.

Authorities say a video showing the victim’s mutilation was sent to his son. Five suspects were arrested. The violence hasn’t been confined to Europe. In Las Vegas, three Florida teens allegedly kidnapped a man after a crypto event, forcing him into the desert at gunpoint and extorting access to his wallets. He was robbed of $4 million and left to walk five miles for help. On May 26, French police arrested over a dozen suspects , including minors, in coordinated raids across Paris and other cities.

Private security firms now report rising demand from crypto professionals seeking personal protection. In response, French authorities have introduced emergency measures, including security briefings and direct police access, as the crypto kidnapping crisis deepens in 2025.

2025-05-29T19:00:41.000Z,"Seized Cryptocurrency: US Government Holds Shocking $21 Billion Fortune","BitcoinWorld Seized Cryptocurrency: US Government Holds Shocking $21 Billion Fortune Imagine holding a fortune so vast it reaches into the tens of billions. Now, imagine that fortune isn’t in gold bars or traditional currency, but in the volatile, digital realm of cryptocurrencies. That’s exactly the situation the US government finds itself in, sitting on an estimated $21 billion worth of seized cryptocurrency . This staggering figure highlights the increasing intersection between digital assets and law enforcement, showcasing the scale at which illicit activities have utilized crypto, and the government’s growing capability to track and seize these assets. What Makes Up These US Government Crypto Holdings? According to reports, including one from The Washington Post citing data from blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis, the bulk of the US government crypto holdings is dominated by the king of crypto itself: Bitcoin . Approximately $20.4 billion of the total $21 billion is held in Bitcoin (BTC). While Bitcoin constitutes the lion’s share, the government’s digital hoard isn’t exclusively BTC. The holdings also include other significant crypto assets such as Ethereum (ETH) and various stablecoins . These assets were confiscated through numerous criminal investigations, spanning various types of digital crimes. Interestingly, Chainalysis data indicates these valuable digital assets are currently stored across just 20 addresses . This concentration in a limited number of wallets underscores the logistical and security challenges involved in managing such significant government crypto assets . How Does the Government Manage Seized Cryptocurrency? Managing seized cryptocurrency is far more complex than simply holding cash or physical assets. It involves intricate processes related to security, legal custody, and potential future disposal. Here are some key aspects: Secure Storage: The government employs highly secure methods, often involving offline or cold storage solutions, to protect the private keys associated with the seized crypto addresses. Given the value, these measures are paramount to prevent theft or loss. Legal Custody: Assets are held under legal forfeiture processes, meaning they are under the government’s control pending legal proceedings. The ultimate fate of the assets depends on the outcome of these cases. Valuation: The value of these holdings fluctuates constantly with market prices. This necessitates ongoing monitoring and valuation, which is where firms like Chainalysis play a crucial role in providing data and analysis. Tracking and Analysis: Blockchain analysis tools are essential not only for initially tracing and seizing the funds but also for monitoring the addresses where the assets are stored. The fact that the holdings are consolidated into just 20 addresses suggests a centralized and highly controlled management strategy, likely overseen by agencies such as the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). What’s the History Behind Significant Bitcoin Seizures? Large-scale Bitcoin seizures by the US government are not new. Over the past decade, law enforcement agencies have become increasingly sophisticated in tracking illicit funds on the blockchain. Some of the most notable seizures have come from high-profile criminal cases: Silk Road: The dark web marketplace was a major source of early large-scale Bitcoin seizures. The government confiscated significant amounts of BTC related to the site’s operations and its founder, Ross Ulbricht. Bitfinex Hack: More recently, the DOJ seized billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin stolen in the 2016 Bitfinex hack, marking one of the largest financial seizures in history. Other Criminal Activities: Seizures also stem from cases involving ransomware attacks, fraud schemes, money laundering, and other cybercrimes where cryptocurrencies were used. These past successes have built the expertise and infrastructure that allows the government to manage its current substantial government crypto assets portfolio. What Challenges Come With Holding Government Crypto Assets? While holding $21 billion in crypto might sound like a windfall, it presents unique challenges for a government entity: Market Volatility: The value of the holdings can swing dramatically in short periods due to market fluctuations. This poses risks and makes reporting on the exact value a moving target. Security Risks: Despite sophisticated security measures, any large concentration of digital assets is a potential target for hackers. Maintaining impregnable security is a constant battle. Legal and Policy Uncertainty: The legal framework around seized digital assets is still evolving. Decisions on when and how to sell these assets can have policy implications. Transparency vs. Security: While transparency about government holdings can be desirable, revealing too much detail about storage methods or addresses could potentially compromise security. Logistics of Disposal: Selling billions of dollars worth of crypto without disrupting the market requires careful planning and execution, often involving auctions or phased sales through various platforms. These challenges require specialized expertise within government agencies, often necessitating collaboration with private sector firms like Chainalysis for data and insights. Could These US Crypto Reserves Impact the Market? The sheer scale of the US crypto reserves raises questions about their potential impact on the market, particularly on Bitcoin’s price, should the government decide to sell a significant portion. Historically, government auctions of seized Bitcoin have been watched closely by the market, but the amounts sold, while substantial in individual cases, were often absorbed without causing drastic crashes. A sale of a significant chunk of the current $20.4 billion in Bitcoin would be unprecedented. However, the government typically aims to maximize recovery value from seized assets. Dumping large amounts onto the open market would likely depress the price, working against that goal. Therefore, any large-scale liquidation would likely be conducted cautiously, perhaps through auctions to accredited investors or phased sales over time, to minimize market disruption. The existence of these large US government crypto holdings is a significant factor in the crypto ecosystem, representing a potential supply that could enter the market, but also demonstrating the increasing legitimacy (in terms of value held by a sovereign entity) of digital assets, albeit acquired through law enforcement actions. Conclusion: A Growing Digital Fortune The revelation that the US government holds approximately $21 billion in seized cryptocurrency , predominantly Bitcoin , is a powerful testament to the growing significance of digital assets in the global financial and criminal landscape. Acquired through successful Bitcoin seizures and other investigations, these government crypto assets represent both a massive digital fortune and a complex management challenge. From secure storage across 20 addresses to navigating market volatility and planning potential future disposal, the government’s handling of these US crypto reserves is a closely watched development. While the challenges are significant, the scale of these holdings underscores the effectiveness of law enforcement in the digital age and highlights the enduring value and presence of cryptocurrencies, even those linked to illicit origins, within the broader financial system.

In a new CNBC interview, Chronert says that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act recently passed in the U.S. House of Representatives will have zero effect on reducing the budget deficit. According to the equity strategist, financing the budget deficit will have a stimulative effect on the economy. “ We think that the proposal as it came out of the House adds another $600 billion or so to next year’s deficit. Now that’s the bad news. The good news is we actually now have tariffs beginning to kick in. And our math is that tariffs could offset about $200 billion of that. So what ends up happening, all told, is that you go from this TCJA (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017) extension, some puts and takes in terms of some tax, other tax cuts, some modest spending reductions, the tariff income and you’re back to about a $2 trillion deficit, which is where we are this year. What that does from our perspective is two things – it means that financing this deficit is going to require ongoing higher treasury issuance, which means higher interest rates, potentially valuation overhang. On the other side, though, it’s still a positive fiscal impulse, which is net good for the economy, economic conditions. And most importantly, S&P 500 earnings.” Chronert, however, warns that expansionary fiscal conditions could negatively impact stock prices. “At the end of the day, higher rates presumably from a discounting of future cash flows perspective draws down or keeps a lid on where equity market valuations can go.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The company on Wednesday morning said it had acquired 4,710 bitcoin — a long-awaited move tied to its crypto treasury strategy revealed in March. At that time, the company initiated a $1.3 billion capital raise to help fund BTC purchases. The stock plunged shortly after alongside a steep drop in broader markets on the Trump Liberation Day tariff announcements. Shares, though, bottomed along with markets mid-month and rose more than 60% in the weeks leading up to the Wednesday announcement. The decline since — now nearing 20% — could be little more than investors selling the news after the big run higher or could be investor exhaustion with corporate bitcoin treasury strategies, which seemingly have been coming at the rate of one or more per day for several weeks. In addition, GameStop's acquisition of \""just\"" roughly $500 million of bitcoin (the dates and prices of the buys weren't disclosed) could be a disappointment given the company's $1.3 billion capital raise, not to mention several billion dollars in free cash that was already on the balance sheet.

The “change the code, not the climate” campaign sought to pressure key industry leaders, Bitcoin miners, and influencers into moving over to a new consensus mechanism and ditch proof-of-work (PoW). Changing The Bitcoin Code — Mission Impossible? In early 2023, Chris Larsen’s Greenpeace teamed up with art activist Benjamin Von Wong for its “change the code, not the climate” campaign to convert Bitcoin’s consensus mechanism to a less energy-consuming model. The campaign at the time claimed that proof-of-stake was much less environmentally harmful due to its lower energy consumption. In a recent post on X, Larsen clarified that his primary objective while funding the campaign was to “turn Bitcoin into an accelerator for direct air capture.” He acknowledged that the $5 million campaign failed; however, he indicated that Ripple had not financed it. Moreover, the former Ripple CEO noted that Bitcoin has witnessed a “remarkable” energy transition in recent years, with mining now mainly relying on renewable sources such as hydropower, nuclear, and wind, based on a recent study conducted by the University of Cambridge. It’s worth mentioning that Greenpeace commissioned Canadian Art activist Benjamin Von Wong to create a unique art piece dubbed the “Skull of Satoshi” — an 11-foot skull featuring the Bitcoin logo and red laser eyes, a nod to the Bitcoin Twitter community who wear laser eyes in their profile pictures. Smokestacks growing out of the top the skull, which is made of recycled electronic waste, aimed to represent the “fossil fuel and coal pollution” caused by Bitcoin mining and the “millions of computers” used to validate network transactions. Instead of infuriating die-hard Bitcoin supporters, the Skull was ironically embraced by many because it was so “ badass ”. Ripple donated the Skull to the Bitcoin community.

In January 2024, the crypto OTC infrastructure firm Finery Markets reported that institutional OTC volumes jumped 106% last year.Cointelegraph approached Hidden Road for comment regarding the estimated OTC volumes globally and in the US, but had not received a response by the time of publication.Rising institutional demandIn December 2024, Higgins highlighted a rising demand for institutional balance sheets from large institutions in an interview with Finance Magnates.“Servicing them [institutional investors] across traditional finance and digital asset ecosystems that have already converged presents a really unique opportunity for us in the marketplace.”Hidden Road’s OTC swap launch in the US marks one of the first products launched by the firm since the company entered a definitive agreement to be acquired by Ripple.Related: Taurus, Parfin partnership to provide crypto infrastructure to institutionsSoon after the deal was announced, Hidden Road received a broker-dealer license from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, a private US corporation and self-regulatory organization regulating member brokerage firms and exchange markets.Hidden Road is also known as one of the first companies to receive a Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) license in Europe, immediately after the framework entered into full force on Dec. 30, 2024.

2025-05-29T13:30:00.000Z,"How African innovators are using blockchain to solve real problems","While blockchain headlines in the West often focus on speculation and regulation, in Africa, it’s a different story, one rooted in necessity, innovation and grassroots adoption. The latest episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast explores this ground-up revolution with Kevin Imani, head of StarkWare’s Africa Venture Studio, who shares how communities across the continent are using blockchain to tackle real-world problems in finance, energy and connectivity.A student movement“Young students were using blockchain before it was mainstream,” Imani explained. From Kenya to Nigeria, local needs, not hype, drove early adoption. In many cases, it was students receiving digital currencies from abroad or freelancers getting paid in dollars and struggling to convert funds into local currency. With limited banking infrastructure or trust in government institutions, decentralized alternatives offered a lifeline.Imani highlighted how centralized systems like Kenya’s E-Mpesa changed access to finance, but still fall short for international payments or off-ramping digital assets. Related: Blockchain.com expands in Africa as local crypto rules take shape“You have to start becoming a trader almost,” he said, describing the convoluted process of converting stablecoins or crypto earnings into usable local funds. This trust gap has fueled peer-to-peer crypto usage. “These were kids holding stablecoins not to spend them, but to store value.” Even before regulators or startups built formal infrastructure, communities had already found use cases for blockchain.Blockchain beyond finance Beyond finance, African innovators are tapping blockchain to address energy insecurity. In rural Zambia, excess power from a mini hydro station could go to waste. Instead, residents can now use that surplus to mine Bitcoin, for example, generating revenue and creating a sustainable power loop. “It’s self-sustaining and reduces waste,” Imani said.Connectivity is another frontier. In areas where traditional internet providers fall short, decentralized WiFi hotspot networks are emerging. With blockchain, community members can share bandwidth and be compensated instantly and transparently. “You don’t need a middleman. It’s fair and trackable,” he said.Still, mainstream adoption remains cautious. Governments like those in Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa are in “standby mode,” focused more on consumer protection than full-scale implementation. But Imani remains optimistic: “The need is there. The technology is here. The only question is how we bridge that gap.”To hear the full conversation on The Clear Crypto Podcast, listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

2025-05-29T13:23:06.000Z,"Tim Berners-Lee says internet DNS should have been more decentralized","World Wide Web and hypertext markup language (HTML) inventor Tim Berners-Lee said that if he were building a domain name service (DNS) today, he would make it “more decentralized.”Speaking at ETH Prague on stage alongside Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, Berners-Lee reflected on early internet architecture decisions.“If I could go back […] I would make it more decentralized,“ he said.DNS was invented in 1983 by Paul Mockapetris, replacing the previous hosts.txt file-based system with a scalable, distributed system for naming IP addresses. Still, while Berners-Lee was not personally responsible for DNS development, he could have opted for a URL structure not tied to the DNS we know today, or he could have pushed for a decentralized alternative. Source: Mely.ethRelated: Decentralized naming could bring ‘next billion’ users to BitcoinCentralization of the DNSThe DNS system is highly centralized, particularly at its top levels of hierarchy. The root zone, which governs top-level domains such as .com and .org, is managed by the US-based nonprofit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).Furthermore, the most authoritative servers are operated by a handful of organizations, further centralizing the system. This allows for easy censorship and control by governments that can unilaterally seize or block domain names.This degree of centralization also makes outages due to centralized service disruption more likely. Control over root zones and domain policies is also concentrated in a few regions and among a select group of stakeholders.There are also concerns regarding privacy because centralized DNS queries can be monitored, logged and intercepted by internet service providers and other intermediaries.Related: Community split on ENS petition against Unstoppable Domains patentCrypto’s solution to the problemDecentralized alternatives to the DNS system are being developed. The most well-known is the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), which maps human-readable names to Ethereum addresses, content on the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS), or other data.Another alternative is Unstoppable Domains. Its system mints domains as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Ethereum and Polygon.ENS has seen a fair share of adoption. In late 2024, ENS Labs also partnered with PayPal and Venmo, sparking speculation about how this partnership is likely to boost mainstream adoption.IPFS runs on Ethereum smart contracts and aims to be user-owned and censorship-resistant. Currently, it is primarily used in Web3 applications, wallets and decentralized websites.Another alternative is Handshake (HNS), which aims to be a decentralized and permissionless naming protocol that is compatible with traditional DNS. A project with a similar aim is Namecoin (NMC), an early Bitcoin fork designed specifically to offer .bit domains and store DNS records onchain with censorship resistance.IPFS is also accompanied by its own Inter-Planetary Name System (IPNS), which enables mutable naming for IPFS addresses (hashes). URLs generated this way point to specific content, not servers.A non-crypto alternative to DNS is OpenNIC. This is a user-run project that offers non-ICANN domains, aiming to decentralize control through community governance.Magazine: Move to Portugal to become a crypto digital nomad — Everybody else is",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/tim-berners-lee-says-dns-should-have-been-more-decentralized?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

In a May 29 X post, Aave founder Stani Kulechov said the foundation borrowed $2 million in GHO tokens. “The EF is not only supplying ETH to Aave, but also borrowing from Aave,” Kulechov wrote, describing the development as “the full DeFi circle.”GHO is a decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin native to the Aave Protocol. Unlike centralized stablecoins, GHO is governed by Aave’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which oversees interest rates, collateral requirements and facilitator selection. The move highlights the EF’s growing engagement with the DeFi ecosystem, moving toward more sophisticated treasury strategies. The foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Source: Stani KulechovEthereum Foundation previously deployed $120 million in DeFiThe foundation’s move to borrow GHO follows a previous $120 million deployment into various protocols, signaling a shift in how it manages its crypto holdings. In February, the EF deployed 45,000 Ether (ETH) across different DeFi protocols, including Aave, Spark and Compound. At the time, the Ether was worth $120 million. Kulechov previously described the fund deployment as the foundation’s “biggest allocation in DeFi.” Because of the move, the Aave founder said that DeFi will win, expressing optimism as the EF added liquidity to the protocol.Apart from Kulechov, community members also celebrated the move, supporting the EF’s ETH holdings management shift. A community member said the development was a win, saying the foundation should “keep it up,” while an X user said it would be positive if the EF continued to use their funds this way. Related: Ethereum Foundation unveils security initiative to supplant legacy systemsCriticisms of the foundation selling Ether In January, Ethereum community members called on the foundation to explore alternatives to selling ETH for operational funding. The community suggested DeFi tools like staking and borrowing stablecoins against ETH. Eric Conner, co-author of EIP-1559, criticized the ETH selling, saying that the foundation’s primary use case seemed to be dumping its holdings. He called the practice “insane,” urging the EF to stake or use DeFi instead of selling. Anthony Sassano, host of The Daily Gwei, proposed that the EF stake part of its ETH and sell the staking rewards.

Mainstream browsers will also integrate agentic capabilities or build interoperability with purpose-built agentic browsers as AI becomes cheaper, according to Zhu.However, the most significant adoption will come within the next decade when onchain and offchain environments will be completely merged for internet users, Zhu said, adding:“Agentic browsers are poised to become the default entry point — much like smartphones replaced feature phones.”In the long term, Donut aims to support payments, gaming, content creation and social interaction, all within a single crypto-native browser. The company also plans to leverage advancements in decentralized identity and confidential computing to turn the browser into a personal “crypto CFO” for retail users.

2025-05-29T11:05:29.000Z,"Reserve Bank of India to roll out new use cases for digital rupee","The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is set to broaden the reach of its digital rupee pilots by introducing new use cases and features for both its retail and wholesale central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), according to the central bank’s Annual Report for 2024–25.The central bank said it aims to explore programmability and offline capabilities for the digital rupee, features that may increase its applicability in areas with limited internet access and tailor payments for specific use cases such as government subsidies or corporate spending controls.Currently, both versions of the CBDC are undergoing pilot testing. The retail CBDC pilot is being conducted with select customers and merchants through participating banks, while the wholesale pilot is targeting use in the interbank market.Per the report, the retail pilot has reached 600,000 users across 17 banks. To further scale adoption, the RBI has allowed “certain non-banks [...] to offer CBDC wallets.”The wholesale pilot has also seen increased institutional interest. The scope of the wholesale was further expanded and diversified with the addition of four standalone primary dealers (SPDs), the report confirmed.Related: Indian high court orders steps to block Proton MailIndia dominates real-time paymentsDuring the financial year 2024–25, digital payments in India experienced significant growth, both in terms of volume and value. According to the report, total digital payments recorded a growth of 34.8% in volume and 17.9% in value.Furthermore, India dominated global real-time payments during the year. The RBI noted that the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) “placed India in a leadership position with a share of 48.5 percent in global real-time payments by volume.”The central bank said several innovative features were introduced to extend the benefits of digital payments to wider segments of society.For instance, the report mentions that the “Delegated Payments” feature was rolled out, allowing “individuals (primary user) to allow another individual (secondary user) to make UPI transactions up to a limit from the primary user’s bank account.”An excerpt of the report.

New features include “Magic Nodes,” which uncover hidden wallet connections among tokenholders, and “Time Travel,” a tool that reconstructs the historical distribution of tokens, potentially detecting early insider activity or coordinated accumulation efforts.“Historical data in crypto is notoriously hard to access because it gets buried under endless new transactions,” Bubblemaps CEO Nicolas Vaiman told Cointelegraph.“Time Travel changes that. It’s like watching a Big Bang, from the initial burst of a single bubble to a full-grown distribution,” he said.Source: BubblemapsThe tool allows users to rewind the token’s entire life cycle and evolving distribution structure, which will help them spot “early signs of manipulation or coordinated dumps,” Vaiman added.Related: Sui validators vote on $162M Cetus recovery plan to restore user fundsSpotting tokens with a large portion of the supply concentrated across a few wallets can help investors detect scams such as rug pulls, where insiders remove liquidity or stage a mass sell-off, resulting in a steep price collapse that leaves investors with worthless tokens.A large-scale rug pull hit the crypto industry on March 16 after the sudden collapse of the Wolf of Wall Street-inspired WOLF token, created by Hayden Davis, the co-creator of the Official Melania Meme (MELANIA) and the Libra token.Source: BubblemapsThe memecoin saw a 99% crash, wiping out most of its peak $42 million market capitalization within a few hours. Over 82% of the token’s supply was held by a single entity, a major red flag for any cryptocurrency.Bubblemaps played a key role in uncovering suspicious wallet activity related to multiple memecoins, including the Melania token and an array of fake Eric Trump-themed memecoins.Related: Coinbase faces $400M bill after insider phishing attackUshering in the “InfoFi” era for Web3 usersBubblemaps said its tools help structured blockchain data become the foundation of “crypto’s next financial layer,” forming part of the growing information finance (InfoFi) era, bringing more powerful forensic tools to investors.“Solana proved that real-time transparency is no longer optional, it’s expected,” Vaiman said, adding:“This fits right into the InfoFi movement, giving users the tools to turn raw onchain data into clear, actionable information.”The platform is integrated with some of the most widely used protocols on Solana, including the memecoin launch platform Pump.fun, DEX Screener, Photon and Bullx, aiming to serve as the core analytics later for the Solana blockchain.Bubblemaps v2 is also available on Ethereum, BNB Chain, Base, Tron and ApeChain.Magazine: DeFi will rise again after memecoins die down: Sasha Ivanov, X Hall of Flame",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bubblemaps-time-travel-for-insider-activity-rug-pulls?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

CEO Leah Wald said the move supports the company’s long-term growth plans.“The filing of a base shelf prospectus supports our growth strategy by providing us with the flexibility to access capital as future opportunities arise in the rapidly evolving Solana ecosystem,” she said.Source: Sol StrategiesIn a May 28 announcement, Solana treasury firm DeFi Dev announced its adoption of Solana liquid staking tokens. The firm will now divert part of its Solana holdings to the liquid staking token dfdvSOL.The announcement followed DeFi Dev’s addition of 88,164 SOL to its treasury in late April, valued at $11.5 million at the time, when it held $34.4 million worth of Solana (SOL).Related: Solana chart hints at 180% rally to $300 if key technical trend holdsWhat is liquid staking?Liquid staking allows tokenholders to earn staking rewards without locking up their assets. Instead, they receive a liquid token that can be traded or used in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.  DeFi Dev expects the adoption of this technology to “enhance the company’s validator operations and treasury management, consistent with its mission to maximize SOL Per Share” growth. Chief investment officer and chief operating officer Parker White said:The adoption of dfdvSOL not only creates additional ways to drive stake to our validators and increase SOL holdings, but also advances our role as a long-term participant in the Solana ecosystem.”Related: Solana may be a memecoin ‘one-trick pony’ — Standard CharteredSol Strategies prepares to safeguard capitalSol Strategies also announced on May 28 that it had completed several key audits and certifications. The company passed SOC 2 Type 1 and SOC 1 Type 1 audits and received ISO 27001 certification for its Solana staking platform.  SOC 2 Type 1 is a report assessing a company’s controls related to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality or privacy at a specific point in time. Such an audit verifies that the firm’s controls meet trust service criteria at the time of the check.SOC 1 Type 1 is a similar report focused on internal controls over financial reporting at a specific point in time. This audit evaluates whether the controls are appropriately designed, but does not assess their effectiveness over time.Lastly, ISO 27001 is an international standard specifying requirements for an information security management system. These standards help manage risks pertaining to data confidentiality, integrity and availability through a continuous improvement framework.To obtain this ISO certificate, a company must demonstrate both the documentation and implementation of controls. Sol Strategies’ Wald explained that all these measures are meant to ensure institutional trust:“By achieving SOC 2 Type 1 and SOC 1 Type 1, alongside our ISO 27001 certification, we’ve demonstrated that institutional clients can trust SOL Strategies with their Solana staking needs.”The compliance efforts come as the firm continues to position itself as a major Solana validator.

At current prices, the stash is valued at about $7.6 billion.Arkham said the newly identified wallets bring Strategy’s total identified holdings to $54.5 billion. If accurate, the findings suggest that Arkham has mapped out most of the company’s stash, making it the first entity to publicly associate the wallets with the firm. “Saylor said he would never reveal his addresses.

It was just relative time allocation that probably was a little too high on the government side, and I’ve reduced that significantly in recent weeks.”When Musk announced in Tesla’s first quarter report that his time spent on DOGE would drop significantly in May, Tesla (TSLA) shares rose over 5% in after-hours trading, despite the company reporting an 80% drop in net income.As of March 31, Tesla still held 11,509 Bitcoin (BTC), currently valued at about $1.24 billion.Related: Musk confirms X Money beta testing ahead of planned 2025 launchTesla shares are still down 5.9% year to date, in part due to Musk diverting his attention away from the company and Tesla’s sales falling considerably in the first quarter.However, the fall is in line with other Big Tech firms, including Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG), which are also in the red in 2025.Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/elon-musk-leaves-doge-admit-tougher-than-expected?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

K33 could purchase up to 57 Bitcoin (BTC) at BTC’s current price of just over $108,000. Source: K33K33 CEO Bull Jenssen posted to X on May 28 that he thinks Bitcoin will be the “best-performing asset in the coming decade,” and his company will “accumulate as many as possible while unlocking powerful operational synergies with our brokerage operation.”“Why wait for the government to build a Bitcoin reserve when you can build you own? Initial financing is secured and we are ready to accelerate from here!” he added in another post. The convertible loans total 45 million Swedish krona ($4.6 million), are interest-free and mature on June 30, 2028. The remaining 15 million Swedish krona ($1.5 million) will come through a new share issuance and warrants, according to K33. If investors convert their warrants before March 2026, they are entitled to additional free warrants at the same conversion rate.

However, the altcoin has maintained a positive signal by closing above the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA) for three consecutive weeks. This critical level has historically acted as a catalyst for significant price rallies.Solana 1-week chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewIn late 2023, SOL broke through the 50-week and 100-week EMAs, solidifying its position above these levels before surging 515% by March 2024. The relative strength index or RSI on the weekly chart is currently at 52.60, indicating growing buying pressure. This setup mirrors past patterns where SOL broke above the 50-week EMA and rallied significantly. With current technicals aligning, SOL appears poised to retest the $300 level by late 2025, a key psychological and historical resistance.Using trend-based Fibonacci (FIB) extensions, SOL’s potential upside could be more compelling.

Elevated OI levels typically signal heightened speculative interest and suggest that traders are positioning for significant price volatility.Solana futures open interest. Source: CoinGlassFunding rates across exchanges have also turned negative, indicating a tilt toward short positions as SOL struggles to reclaim the key $180 resistance. While this often reflects bearish sentiment, it also opens the door for a potential short squeeze. Crypto futures analyst Byzantine General pointed out that current market conditions — characterized by elevated OI, rising aggregated volume, and relatively muted cross-exchange funding — suggest that SOL price may be stabilizing. He noted this setup could catalyze a sharp upside move, with the possibility of a breakout toward the $300 level if momentum builds.Solana price, aggregated open interest, volume, and funding rate.

Despite the recent gains, Ether is down 21% in 2025, while the broader cryptocurrency market has seen a 5% increase.Ether bulls are motivated to keep ETH above $2,600 ahead of the monthly expiry. However, weak network activity on Ethereum suggests that the upside potential may be limited.Ether/USD (blue) vs. Total crypto capitalization (green). Source: TradingView / CointelegraphAnalysts believe Ether’s underperformance stems from rising competition among blockchains focused on decentralized applications. Still, ETH holds a key advantage as the only altcoin with a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) offering in the United States. These ETFs attracted $287 million in net inflows between May 19 and May 27, reflecting increased interest from institutional investors.Even as demand for Ether-based investment products grows, deposits and onchain activity on the Ethereum network have declined. This trend is especially troubling as rivals like Solana, BNB Chain, and Tron continue to gain market share.

Source: Laevitas.chEven though the $1.3 billion in call (buy) options dominate the May 30 expiry, that doesn’t necessarily imply that those traders will reinvest the proceeds in new bullish positions. Many option strategies involve multiple maturities and are structured in ways that don’t benefit from ETH rising above specific thresholds. Additionally, traders may hedge their exposure through futures markets.The $1.1 billion in put (sell) options were clearly caught off guard, as 97% were set at $2,600 or lower. These contracts will expire worthless if ETH holds above that level at 8:00 am UTC on May 30. While this imbalance is unusual, a similar outcome could affect the overly optimistic call options with strike prices at $2,800 and above if ETH remains near current levels.Related: SharpLink launches Ethereum treasury, taps Joe Lubin as board chairBelow are four likely scenarios based on current price trends.

The net result favors the call instruments by $200 million.Between $2,500 and $2,600: $500 million calls vs. $130 million puts, favoring calls by $370 million.Between $2,600 and $2,700: $590 million calls vs. $35 million puts, favoring calls by $555 million.Between $2,700 and $2,900: $780 million calls vs. $10 million puts, favoring calls by $770 million.Bulls are strongly incentivized to push ETH past $2,700, yet the broader context may override those efforts. Given the strong correlation between cryptocurrencies and the S&P 500, macroeconomic indicators and corporate earnings are likely to remain the primary forces shaping investor risk appetite—and ultimately, ETH’s price at the time of the monthly options expiry.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-28T21:22:22.000Z,"Bitcoin analyst says BTC price peak in $220K to $330K range still possible","Key takeaways:Bitcoin researcher Sminston With says BTC could gain 100% to 200%, with a cycle peak between $220,000 to $330,000.Bitcoin continues to exhibit strong cyclical volatility, contradicting the belief that its price swings are softening over time.Over $4 billion in BTC has been moved by long-term holders, warning of a price correction.Analysis from Bitcoin (BTC) researcher Sminston With implied that a BTC price peak is still 100% to 200% away from current prices. In a recent X post, With shared a Bitcoin price chart using a 365-day simple moving average (SMA) aligned with a power law model (R²=0.96). The model suggests Bitcoin’s price follows a predictable, non-random pattern over time, distinct from the exponential growth models often applied to stocks and equities.Bitcoin power law fit analysis by Sminston With. Source: XThe chart revealed that Bitcoin’s 365-day SMA typically peaks 2 to 3 times above the power law trendline in each market cycle. With Bitcoin priced at $110,000 on May 27, this model projects a potential cycle top between $220,000 and $330,000. This forecast aligns with historical patterns, where Bitcoin has consistently overshot this trendline during bullish phases, offering an optimistic outlook for investors.A second graph in the post highlights Bitcoin’s price deviation from the power law fit, showing steady cyclical volatility without exponential decay in sustained peaks. This challenges the common belief that Bitcoin’s price cycles are becoming less extreme over time, indicating that the cryptocurrency’s volatility remains a defining trait, potentially leading to significant price swings over the next few months. In Q3 2024, With accurately predicted that Bitcoin would reach a six-figure price by January 2025, when BTC was trading around $60,000.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bears will try to pull the price to the 20-day exponential moving average ($105,453), which is a key level to watch out for. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, it suggests that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips. That improves the prospects of a retest of the $111,980 level. If buyers overcome the $111,980 resistance, the BTC/USDT pair could surge to $130,000.Contrarily, a break and close below the 20-day EMA could strengthen the bears. The pair could then plummet to the psychologically crucial support of $100,000, which is likely to attract solid buying by the bulls.Ether price predictionBuyers could not push Ether (ETH) above the $2,738 resistance on May 27, but they have kept up the pressure.ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe ETH/USDT pair has formed a bullish ascending triangle pattern, which will complete on a break and close above $2,738.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe flattish 20-day EMA ($2.33) and the RSI just below the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears.

Buyers are expected to fiercely defend the $2 level because a break below it may sink the pair to $1.61.On the upside, a break and close above the 20-day EMA opens the gates for a rally to $2.65.
