2025-05-30T18:41:06.000Z,"FBI Seeks Victims Connected to FUNNULL Pig Butchering Crypto Investment Scam","The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is looking for victims connected to the FUNNULL pig butchering crypto investment scheme. In a new press release , the FBI states that it’s seeking those affected by the pig butchering scheme, which typically involves scammers gaining the trust of victims over time to convince them to invest digital assets into fraudulent websites that they control. Once the victims invest, they are further tricked by lucrative returns on their investment before ultimately being locked out of their accounts and losing access to their funds. Earlier this week, FUNNULL – a Philippines-based computer infrastructure firm – was sanctioned by the US Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). According to authorities, FUNNULL purchases data such as IP addresses in bulk and sells them to criminals to host fraudulent investment websites and other malicious content. It was found that the firm could have sold data to up to hundreds of thousands of websites that run these types of scams. The Treasury Department said at the time that the majority of crypto scams reported to the FBI were linked to FUNNULL and that US-based victims lost about a combined $200 million to these types of schemes, or $150,000 per individual affected. Sanctions were also placed on FUNNULL’s administrator, Chinese national Liu Lizhi, who allegedly was in possession of documents that tracked data on the firm’s employees, including ranking them based on performance.

2025-05-30T18:20:08.000Z,"Champions League Finalist PSG Adopts Bitcoin for Treasury Reserves","French football giant Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) has scored a historic first: It has become the inaugural major sports club in the world to allocate Bitcoin (BTC) to its treasury reserves. The move, announced by Pär Helgosson, Head of PSG Labs and Web3, at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas on May 29, signals a bold embrace of digital assets by a global sporting powerhouse. PSG Cements Bitcoin as Strategic Reserve According to Helgosson, PSG started quietly acquiring BTC in 2024 and has maintained those holdings since. “We put Bitcoin in our books. We took our fiat reserves and we actually allocated Bitcoin,” the executive stated. “We still have it… as one of the largest clubs in the world, we’re the largest player in the sports ecosystem to do that.” The club’s revelation comes just days before its showpiece UEFA Champions League final match against Italy’s Inter Milan, amplifying the visibility of this strategic shift. It also exceeds earlier crypto experiments like fan tokens, with Helgosson emphasizing the alignment with PSG’s youthful, tech-savvy 550 million strong fanbase, of whom approximately 80% are under age 34. “We’re about what’s next, just like Bitcoin,” he declared. The Ligue 1 champion is also doubling down on its focus on digital assets by supporting entrepreneurs and ventures in the space. “We will help you launch, list, and raise,” said Helgosson, signaling PSG’s intent to function as both an investor and a platform for crypto-native projects. BTC Treasury Wave Catching On The move places the football club alongside recent corporate entrants like GameStop, which revealed on May 28 that it had made its first Bitcoin treasury purchase of 4,710 BTC, worth over $500 million at the time, to become a top holder. It mirrors the relentless accumulation approach pioneered by Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which added another 4,020 BTC for $427 million on May 26, bringing its colossal holdings to 580,250 BTC. Other firms, such as KULR Technology and Japan’s Metaplanet, which formally established Bitcoin Treasury Operations as a core business line, have followed a similar path. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s price has struggled to maintain recent highs. At the time of this writing, the king cryptocurrency was trading at around $106,134, a slight 1.4% dip over the last 24 hours and a 4.54% decline across seven days. Consequently, it has pulled back by more than 5% from its all-time high of $111,814, which it hit last week.

2025-05-30T18:15:16.000Z,"Ripple CEO: XRP Was Designed by Engineers Who Recognized Bitcoin Flaws","Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has once again sparked waves across the digital asset space, this time addressing prominent figures at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Swiss National Bank. In a compelling video clip shared by XRP Avengers on X, Garlinghouse laid out a sharp, unflinching case for XRP’s superiority over Bitcoin, underscoring the intentional design choices that position XRP as a far more scalable and efficient alternative for global payments. Garlinghouse’s Case Against Bitcoin In the widely circulated clip, Garlinghouse confidently articulated the technological limitations of Bitcoin, highlighting its sluggish transaction speeds and high costs . According to the Ripple CEO, Bitcoin’s architecture, while revolutionary in its time, has become a bottleneck for practical use cases, especially in the realm of cross-border payments. Brad Garlinghouse DESTROYS Bitcoin in front of the IMF & Swiss National Bank, presenting the case for $XRP Brad Garlinghouse said “ #XRP was designed by engineers who recognized Bitcoin’s flaws, especially around scalability. XRP is 1,000x faster.” pic.twitter.com/xFL6D41HiM — XRP Avengers (@XRP_Avengers) May 29, 2025 Garlinghouse emphasized that XRP was designed by engineers who had studied Bitcoin’s shortcomings and sought to build something fundamentally better. Specifically, he noted that XRP offers transactions that are 1,000 times faster and 1,000 times cheaper compared to Bitcoin . For Garlinghouse, this distinction isn’t just technical; it’s pivotal to reshaping how the world moves money across borders, particularly for individuals and businesses that are currently sidelined by the inefficiencies of traditional banking systems. The End of Pre-Funding and the Rise of On-Demand Liquidity A central pillar of Ripple’s vision, Garlinghouse explained, is the idea of eliminating the need for pre-funding accounts in global financial transactions. Traditionally, international money movement relies on a web of nostro and vostro accounts, pre-funded holdings that financial institutions use to settle transactions across borders. This system is costly, slow, and often inaccessible to smaller players. Garlinghouse’s argument is clear: digital assets like XRP can provide global liquidity on demand, unlocking a more democratized and efficient payment infrastructure. By doing so, Ripple aims to level the playing field, not just for massive multinational corporations moving hundreds of millions of dollars, but also for the small freelancers and businesses scattered across the globe. He illustrated this point vividly by referencing the case of a freelancer in the Philippines, designing for a London-based company and expecting a modest payment. Under current systems, the freelancer’s payout often gets delayed until they accumulate at least $1,000 in their account, a hurdle that disproportionately affects smaller earners. Garlinghouse contends that Ripple’s technology stack can seamlessly enable such microtransactions, making the global economy more inclusive. Building the Internet of Value Drawing parallels to the foundational protocols of the internet, Garlinghouse likened Ripple’s ambitions to the role played by TCP/IP and HTTP in the rise of the Internet of Information. These early internet protocols revolutionized global communication by standardizing the flow of information across connected devices. According to Garlinghouse, Ripple envisions a similar transformation, but for value. Using blockchain technologies, particularly XRP and its associated open-source technology stack, Ripple aims to construct an Internet of Value where payments can move with the same speed, fluidity, and universality as data. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This vision, he argued, has profound implications for financial inclusion, enabling anyone, anywhere, to participate in the global economy without the burdens imposed by legacy financial systems. It’s not just about helping big banks and corporations; it’s about empowering everyday people and businesses who have long been underserved. XRP’s Technical Edge Over Bitcoin Garlinghouse’s takedown of Bitcoin at the IMF and Swiss National Bank wasn’t just a marketing pitch, it was a detailed exposition of why XRP’s technical architecture matters. Unlike Bitcoin’s proof-of-work system, which demands immense energy consumption and slows down as the network grows, XRP uses a consensus protocol that dramatically accelerates transactions while keeping costs minimal. This makes XRP better suited for high-volume, low-value payments, the kind of microtransactions that are increasingly vital in the digital age. Bitcoin’s design, while robust as a store of value, has struggled to scale effectively for these kinds of applications, leaving a wide opening for Ripple and XRP to step in. Brad Garlinghouse’s address, amplified by XRP Avengers’ viral post, underscores a defining moment in the evolving narrative between Bitcoin and XRP. While Bitcoin continues to hold its position as the pioneer and poster child of cryptocurrencies, Ripple’s CEO is making it clear that the future of cross-border payments requires something faster, cheaper, and more scalable. Ripple’s mission to build an Internet of Value, using XRP as its backbone, is more than just technological ambition; it’s a bid to reshape how money moves in a globalized world. With the support of a passionate community like XRP Avengers and the attention of financial heavyweights like the IMF and Swiss National Bank, Ripple is positioning XRP as not just an alternative to Bitcoin, but as the digital asset purpose-built for the next generation of global finance.

In a new post, crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 789,400 followers on the social media platform X that if Bitcoin can break through the resistance range between $106,500-$107,000, the flagship crypto asset will likely soar beyond its current all-time high of about $111,800. “Bitcoin has lost the crucial support level. However, the drop isn’t as severe as we might expect. This means, reclaim of $106,500-$107,000, that would be the party trigger sign for new all-time highs.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Bitcoin is trading for $105,694 at time of writing, down 1.5% in the last 24 hours. Next up, the analyst says that Ethereum ( ETH ) is likely still in an uptrend and gearing up for a massive breakout. “ETH did break through $2,700 and failed immediately. The thing is, that’s not the crucial level. The second thing is, it’s still building up for a big breakout. When does that happen? Above $2,850 is where the liquidity is and the longer it takes for a breakout to happen, the heavier it will be.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X He also says that ETH has been showing strength against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) for the past two months and may soon break out against the flagship crypto asset. “ETH has seen a strong upwards move in April and May, It has also retested the OB (order block) at 0.023 BTC and has held there. This means that we’re about to test the highs and continue the run.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X ETH/BTC is trading for 0.2461 BTC ($2,597), down slightly in the last 24 hours. Lastly, the analyst says he is turning bullish on Bittensor ( TAO ), a decentralized blockchain-based network that aims to be a marketplace for artificial intelligence (AI) models. “TAO looks great, as it’s fighting the final resistance. Ideally, sub-$400 is a steal for this one in which we continue to show an uptrend even if it drops south of that level. It’s the only one in my portfolio nicely holding up and I think we’ll be seeing $700-$800 soon.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X TAO is trading for $397 at time of writing, down 6.4% in the last 24 hours.

Moreover, the price dropped below the crucial support in the early trading hours and has failed to reclaim the lost levels, which indicates a tight bearish hold over the token. However, the market sentiments remain largely bullish, which suggests the BTC price could rise after the ongoing correction. The Bitcoin’s recent drop isn’t directly attributed to a court decision on tariffs but rather to President Donald Trump’s announcement of imposing tariffs on Canada and Mexico. This move sparked widespread volatility across the markets, causing Bitcoin to plummet below $91,000 and resulting in nearly a billion dollars in total liquidations. Meanwhile, a recent US federal court ruling blocking Trump’s $10 billion tariffs has sparked optimism for Bitcoin’s future. What’s Next- Will Bitcoin Rise to $120K or Drop to $100K? The BTC price recently experienced a significant bullish push, probably due to the Golden Cross, which may soon turn into a death cross. The rising scepticism around the network has made the perp whales optimistic, while the spot traders are preparing for the new BTC highs. As per the data from Binance , the perpetual whales are defending $100K with bids, while spot sellers are looking to sell at $120K. With this, the BTC price forecast remains hung with both the possibility of forming a new ATH at $120K or plunging back to $100K. As seen in the above chart, the BTC price has displayed a similar divergence to that displayed in the first few days of April; however, it is reversed now. On the other hand, the DMI has displayed a bearish crossover while the RSI maintains a steep descending trend. Therefore, the bearish reversal may soon be validated while the price could head to the local support at $102,153 at 0.786 FIB. Here, if the price fails to trigger a rebound, it may drop below $100K, otherwise, a rebound could push it within the resistance zone between $105,937 and $107,615. Now, all depends on the monthly close, which is required to be above the local support; else, the Bitcoin (BTC) price may witness a deeper correction.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-price-displays-a-similar-deviation-is-it-time-for-a-deeper-correction/,"BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

Detective Drove Victim to Kidnap Site, Reports Claim According to reports , both detectives in question were working as off-duty security for the alleged crypto criminal, though whether they received prior approval from the department is unknown. New: The NYPD stripped 2 detectives of their guns /badges & placed them on desk duty after the dept. learned they'd had been working security for William Duplessie & John Woeltz, the crypto investors recently arrested for allegedly kidnapping a man & torturing him. @CBSNewYork pic.twitter.com/BBsS9uVR2U — Tim McNicholas (@TimMcNicholas) May 29, 2025 One of the detectives, a veteran with nearly 20 years of experience, reportedly drove the Italian crypto kidnapping victim from the airport to the luxury SoHo apartment where he was eventually held captive. “Every city employee is expected to follow the law, including our officers, both on and off duty,” the mayor’s office said in a statement. “We are disturbed by these allegations, and as soon as it came to our attention, the officers were placed on modified duty.” Two Arrested in Shock Crypto Kidnapping News of the scandal comes just one week after the unidentified Italian businessman escaped the weeks-long crypto crime ordeal that saw him shocked, tortured and held at gunpoint. Crypto businessmen John Woeltz and William Duplessie allegedly lured the victim to New York City on May 6 after threatening to kill his family in a bid to gain access to his Bitcoin . The hostage escaped barefoot when Duplessie and Woeltz turned their backs on him shortly after he revealed his Bitcoin password. Reports indicate that the anonymous victim may have been a business partner of Duplessie and Woeltz, although this has not been confirmed. The family of Woeltz told The New York Post on Monday that the multimillionaire may have been “manipulated” into the crime himself. “He’s a kind, caring, loving person, so he was completely controlled by other people,” Woeltz’s relative told the media outlet.

2025-05-30T17:39:17.000Z,"BTC dip is opening doors for new investors, yet analysts favor RUVI for higher profits","Bitcoin, the king of cryptocurrencies, has experienced a decline that many see as an opportunity for new investors to join the crypto market at a lower cost. However, while Bitcoin’s entry point may seem appealing, analysts are increasingly directing attention toward Ruvi AI, an emerging cryptocurrency with exponential potential. With a record-breaking presale and significant partnerships, Ruvi AI is positioned to deliver stronger gains than the established Bitcoin. Here’s how Bitcoin’s dip compares to Ruvi AI’s rise and why it’s being hailed as the smarter investment choice. Bitcoin’s decline creates market entry opportunities Bitcoin’s recent downturn may appear disheartening to long-time investors but has opened the door for new market participants. Lower prices provide an opportunity to buy into a well-established cryptocurrency without the high costs associated with Bitcoin’s all-time highs. Bitcoin’s reputation as a decentralized digital asset and its wide acceptance in traditional and emerging markets make it a staple in the crypto world. However, price stagnation and high market cap have created limitations for Bitcoin’s future growth. Its dominance, while notable, has somewhat plateaued, providing modest returns for those entering now. While Bitcoin’s reputation as a high-value asset remains intact, its growth potential pales in comparison to opportunities in more dynamic, emerging cryptocurrencies. Ruvi AI’s utility and early-stage potential Unlike Bitcoin, Ruvi AI is rooted in utility and innovation, making it a compelling investment for those seeking substantial returns. By combining artificial intelligence and blockchain, Ruvi AI addresses real-world challenges in industries like healthcare, logistics, and finance. Industry applications driving growth Healthcare: Ruvi AI facilitates AI-powered solutions for diagnostics and improved patient care, streamlining medical processes. Logistics: Its advanced algorithms optimize supply chains, reducing inefficiencies and operational costs. Finance: Ruvi AI offers AI-driven tools for fraud detection and secure transactions, making it invaluable for financial institutions. Rather than relying solely on market trends like Bitcoin, Ruvi AI’s adoption in these scalable industries ensures consistent demand and long-term relevance. Enhancing accessibility with WEEX partnership Ruvi AI recently partnered with WEEX Exchange, a collaboration that enhances liquidity and ensures global access. This partnership allows investors from across the world to trade Ruvi AI tokens effortlessly, broadening the project’s user base and improving token usability. The WEEX partnership cements Ruvi AI’s vision of becoming a globally recognized and utility-driven cryptocurrency. Record-breaking presale and investment potential Ruvi AI’s early momentum has been hard to ignore. The project’s presale has already sold 125 million tokens, raising an impressive $1.4 million. With an entry price of $0.015 per token, even small-scale investors can participate in its planned growth. Its VIP bonus structure makes the investment even more attractive, offering scalable rewards: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment with 40% bonus): Total Tokens: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $1: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment with 60% bonus): Total Tokens: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $1: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment with 100% bonus): Total Tokens: 1,280,000 (double the base allocation). Value at $1: $1,280,000. With analysts projecting Ruvi AI to reach $1 by Q4 2025, the potential 100x return is far more exciting compared to Bitcoin’s current growth trajectory. Bitcoin vs Ruvi AI: the smarter investment While Bitcoin remains a trusted name in cryptocurrency, its growth potential is relatively limited due to its maturity and high market cap. Ruvi AI, by contrast, offers early-stage growth, practical utility, and groundbreaking technologies that align with industries demanding immediate solutions. Its affordable entry point, presale success, and global reach through partnerships like WEEX make it a standout choice for forward-thinking investors. Final thoughts Bitcoin’s decline may be a tempting opportunity, but for those seeking larger and faster returns, Ruvi AI presents a more exciting avenue. Its utility-driven roadmap, ongoing partnerships, and exponential ROI potential set it apart from traditional players in the crypto landscape. For investors looking to capitalize on the next wave of cryptocurrency innovation, Ruvi AI could very well be the smartest investment choice of 2025.

Korea’s presidential race with a 96.8% chance on Polymarket. The June 3 election is pivotal for crypto policy; 36% of eligible S. Korean voters own crypto. Candidates propose pro-crypto measures like spot Bitcoin ETFs and improved bank access. Lee Jae-myung is emerging as a frontrunner for South Korea’s 2025 presidential election, according to trader sentiment on Polymarket. As of this press time, the Democratic Party candidate is leading at 96.8% per share, reflecting a 96.8% market-implied chance of victory. Polymarket is a decentralized prediction market where users bet real money on future events. Each “Yes” share pays out $1 if the event occurs and nothing if it does not. The closer the price is to $1, the higher the market’s confidence in that outcome. Meanwhile, the pricing does not reflect polling or vote share. A common misconception is that a 97-cent “Yes” price equates to 97% of expected votes. In reality, the figure reflects the collective probability, as perceived by market participants, that Lee will win the election.

2025-05-30T17:20:23.000Z,"How to Do Cloud Mining in 2025: HashFly Review & Beginner’s Guide to Bitcoin Mining","Discover how to mine Bitcoin in 2025 with HashFly, the world’s leading cloud mining platform. Learn how to get started, earn daily crypto rewards, and explore flexible, eco-friendly mining contracts. Cloud mining has emerged as a compelling alternative for individuals seeking to profit from digital assets like Bitcoin without the complexities associated with traditional mining or trading. Platforms such as HashFly are at the forefront, offering accessible and potentially lucrative avenues for both novices and seasoned investors.​ The Appeal of Cloud Mining Cloud mining involves renting computing power from remote data centers to mine cryptocurrencies. This model eliminates the need for personal mining equipment, thereby reducing concerns related to hardware costs, maintenance, and energy consumption. In 2025, cloud mining has become particularly appealing due to several factors:​ Lower Upfront Costs: Traditional mining requires significant investment in hardware and infrastructure. Cloud mining allows users to participate without these substantial initial expenses. ​ Operational Efficiency: By outsourcing the technical aspects of mining to specialized providers, individuals can avoid the complexities of hardware setup and maintenance. ​ Accessibility: Cloud mining opens the door for those who may lack the technical expertise or resources to engage in traditional mining, democratizing access to cryptocurrency profits. ​ Regular Passive Income: Participants can earn a consistent stream of cryptocurrency rewards, providing a potential source of passive income. ​ Positive Outlook for the Cryptocurrency Market The cryptocurrency market in 2025 is experiencing transformative growth, bolstered by increased institutional adoption and regulatory clarity. Analysts predict that Bitcoin could reach between $190,000 and $210,000 by the end of the year, driven by its finite supply and rising institutional demand. Additionally, the global market for cryptocurrency trends is projected to grow from $2.1 billion in 2024 to $5 billion by 2030, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.4%. ​ Cloud Mining vs. Traditional Trading While traditional cryptocurrency trading involves buying and selling digital assets to capitalize on price fluctuations, it requires a deep understanding of market dynamics and can be highly volatile. Cloud mining offers a more stable and predictable alternative:​ Predictable Returns: Cloud mining contracts often provide fixed returns, offering a level of predictability not typically found in trading. ​ Reduced Risk Exposure: By participating in mining, individuals can earn cryptocurrency rewards without being directly exposed to market volatility. ​ Diversification: Engaging in cloud mining allows investors to diversify their cryptocurrency portfolio, balancing the risks associated with trading. Comparing Cloud Mining to Other Crypto Income Models In the broader context of earning through crypto, cloud mining offers an attractive alternative to other models like staking, yield farming, or day trading. Each method has its own risk-reward dynamics: Staking requires locking up assets for a period of time and is generally limited to proof-of-stake (PoS) cryptocurrencies. While it’s relatively low-risk, the returns can be modest compared to cloud mining. Yield Farming, largely driven by decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, is highly volatile and often exposed to smart contract risks, rug pulls, and impermanent loss. Day Trading, while potentially lucrative, demands constant monitoring, technical expertise, and a high tolerance for market volatility. Cloud mining , by contrast, provides a more passive and predictable income stream, especially for those who want exposure to the crypto economy without devoting full-time effort or technical know-how. And with platforms like HashFlyoffering contracts starting as low as $50, it also opens the door for low-risk experimentation. ​ HashFly: Leading the Way in Cloud Mining Founded in 2013, HashFly has established itself as a prominent player in the cloud mining industry, offering services for major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Litecoin (LTC).

2025-05-30T17:19:08.000Z,"European Central Bank Warns Banks Against Rushing Into Crypto","As traditional banks in Europe become more involved with cryptocurrencies, the European Central Bank (ECB) is growing concerned. On May 30, ECB policymaker and Governor of the Bank of Italy, Fabio Panetta, gave a severe warning. He said that banks working closely with crypto companies could risk customer trust, which, if lost, could cause the whole financial system to suffer. ECB Warns Crypto Losses Could Damage Trust in Banks Panetta shared his thoughts during the Bank of Italy’s annual report presentation. He explained that many people do not fully understand the risk associated with crypto assets. If banks start offering these assets, customers might believe they are as safe as regular savings or investment products. However, they are not. Digital currencies are risky and not protected in the same way as normal bank services. He explained that the concern is about individual losses and trust. If enough people lose confidence in banks because of crypto losses, it could harm the entire credit system. Panetta’s view on crypto aligns with that of Swiss National Bank (SNB) President Martin Schlegel. Schlegel said the bank will not hold Bitcoin as a reserve in April. He explained that Bitcoin’s well-known price swings made it unsuitable for the bank’s needs . Schlegel stated that stability is critical for any asset worthy of national reserve inclusion. Banks Are Moving Ahead With Crypto Plans Even with these warnings, some banks are already making moves in the crypto space. Earlier this year, Intesa Sanpaolo, one of Italy’s largest banks, bought €1 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC). The bank’s CEO, Carlo Messina, called this acquisition a “test.” On the other hand, it is also part of a larger plan. The bank now has its digital asset trading desk and handles crypto trades. In Spain, Santander is also preparing to enter the crypto market . According to reports, the bank is considering creating its stablecoin and offering crypto services through its digital app. Reportedly, top banks like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo are working together to launch a joint stablecoin project . These steps show that major banks are becoming more active in crypto. This is happening quickly, and some experts believe that regulations are not keeping up. ECB Calls for Caution It is important to note that Fabio Panetta is not against change. However, he believes that banks and regulators need to be more careful. He highlighted that the main problem is trust. Banks are seen as safe and reliable. If people lose money through crypto services offered by banks, that trust could break. He emphasized that rebuilding may be difficult to rebuild once it is broken.

While the US is leading in Bitcoin accumulation and hashrate distribution, the UAE is starting to develop into a rather big player in the global Bitcoin ecosystem, especially in the Middle East. Officially, the US holds the most Bitcoin with more than 207k in its fold, but some reports suggest that the UAE holds approximately 420k Bitcoin, valued at around $46 billion. However, there are no official sources to support the claim, as this is more of a rumor that’s been spreading around. Even Changpeng Zhao (former CEO of Binance) shared this news last year on X but eventually deleted that post, likely due to no solid evidence. Still, the UAE definitely holds some Bitcoin and the country is rapidly advancing its Bitcoin mining capabilities, with an estimated operational capacity of 400 megawatts last year.

2025-05-30T17:07:20.000Z,"Crypto Regulation Chaos: Trump Dinner, $2.5B Bitcoin Play, SEC Drops Binance Suit","It’s been a blockbuster week in U.S. crypto regulation, as power players in Washington and Wall Street grapple with digital assets, cybersecurity, and political influence. From Trump’s meme coin dinner to the SEC’s stunning reversal on Binance, a new era in crypto regulation may be dawning—and not without controversy. Trump’s Meme Coin Dinner Sparks Transparency Backlash On May 25, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson dodged pointed questions about a private meme coin dinner hosted by President Donald Trump at his Virginia golf club earlier in the week. Speaker Mike Johnson sidestepped transparency questions on Trump’s meme coin dinner, as Democrats call for a DOJ probe. #trump #memecoin https://t.co/IST3Gu2foM — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 26, 2025 The event, reportedly attended by top investors in the Trump-themed “TRUMP” meme coin, has raised red flags among Democrats, 35 of whom have called on the Department of Justice to investigate possible corruption and foreign influence. In a CNN interview, Johnson claimed ignorance of the May 22 event and refused to comment on whether the guest list should be released. With crypto now playing a visible role in campaign fundraising and narrative-building, critics argue that unchecked intersections between politics and digital assets pose serious ethical questions. Banking Lobby Pushes Back Against SEC Cyber Rule While political tensions flared, financial institutions were busy behind the scenes. On May 22, U.S. banking heavyweights—including the American Bankers Association, Bank Policy Institute, and SIFMA—petitioned the SEC to withdraw its controversial cybersecurity incident disclosure rule. The regulation, known as Item 1.05 in Form 8-K, mandates disclosure of material cyber incidents within four business days. However, industry groups warn that this requirement endangers national security, disrupts law enforcement efforts, and causes unnecessary panic. Their message: transparency shouldn’t come at the cost of an effective cybersecurity response. David Sacks Floats ‘Budget-Neutral’ Bitcoin Reserve Strategy In a more surprising development, David Sacks—a key White House adviser on crypto and artificial intelligence—proposed that the U.S. could begin acquiring Bitcoin without increasing the national debt. White House’s David Sacks Hints at Budget-Neutral Path for U.S. Bitcoin Purchases through asset reallocation rather than new spending. #Bitcoin #Bitcoin2025 https://t.co/xX9g1PBwWs — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 28, 2025 Speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas on May 27, Sacks hinted that Treasury assets could be reallocated to build a strategic Bitcoin reserve, suggesting a shift toward digital gold without new government spending. This “budget-neutral” strategy could become a foundational talking point if the next administration, potentially Trump-led, leans further into Bitcoin as a geopolitical hedge. Trump Media Bets $2.5 Billion on Bitcoin Treasury Strategy In tandem with the government’s speculative interest in Bitcoin, Trump Media & Technology Group is taking decisive action. The company behind Truth Social announced a private placement offering worth $2.5 billion to amass what could become one of the largest corporate Bitcoin treasuries in history. The funding, split between $1.5 billion in common stock and $1 billion in convertible notes, is expected to close by May 29. With the president’s brand directly tied to both political and crypto narratives, this move solidifies Trump’s role as an emerging Bitcoin maximalist, at least in the public eye. Departing CFTC Commissioner Warns of ‘Big Swings’ in Oversight Even as crypto gains institutional favor, regulatory instability looms. Christy Romero, outgoing commissioner of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), issued a cautionary note during her farewell remarks at the Brookings Institution. As she exits the CFTC, Christy Romero issues a warning: “big swings” in regulatory policies could crack the foundation of U.S. markets. #ChristyRomero #CFTC https://t.co/w1aSAb44E5 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 27, 2025 Romero warned that “big swings” between aggressive regulation and hands-off deregulation could jeopardize the integrity of U.S. financial markets. While she didn’t name names, the remarks are widely seen as a critique of the Trump administration’s shifting stance on digital assets and market oversight. Department of Labor Reverses 401(k) Crypto Ban Another reversal this week came from the U.S. Department of Labor. On May 28, it rescinded its 2022 guidance that discouraged cryptocurrency in workplace retirement plans. The prior policy had warned plan sponsors to exercise “extreme care” and triggered investigations into firms offering crypto options. U.S. Department of Labor Reverses Crypto Guidance, Opens Door for 401(k) Bitcoin Exposure, ending Biden-era restrictions. #Crypto #401k https://t.co/9Pw4USYtwS — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 28, 2025 Now, the reversal indicates a more neutral stance on crypto regulation, opening the door for Bitcoin to return as a viable 401(k) asset—a potentially transformative development for crypto adoption among retail investors. SEC Ends Lawsuit Against Binance, CZ In perhaps the week’s most jaw-dropping twist, the SEC dropped its high-profile lawsuit against Binance and its former CEO Changpeng Zhao. The case, filed in June 2023, accused the exchange of inflating volumes and mishandling customer funds. @SECGov and @binance legal clash ends as U.S. regulator drops landmark lawsuit. #binance #SEC https://t.co/Qlz11yoG4n — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 30, 2025 On May 29, both parties jointly signed a dismissal, bringing an end to a two-year saga that had cast a shadow over the global exchange. The sudden conclusion leaves observers wondering: Is the crypto industry’s biggest regulatory battle truly over or just entering a new phase? This week revealed a U.S. crypto sector at an inflection point. While Trump allies promote digital assets through political events and billion-dollar treasuries, regulators are struggling to keep pace—and often stepping back.

2025-05-30T17:00:45.000Z,"Santander’s Crypto Ambitions: Spain’s Top Bank To Roll Out Stablecoin","Banco Santander SA, one of the largest banks in Europe and Spain, is reportedly considering introducing its own stablecoin. The bank also plans to give its digital banking arm, Openbank, the ability to offer crypto services to retail clients. According to a Bloomberg report from May 29, the Spanish bank’s online unit has applied for licenses to operate these services under the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. Euro And Dollar Stablecoins For Retail Clients While Santander has not officially commented on the report, Bloomberg sources reportedly indicate that the bank is evaluating the launch of euro- and dollar-denominated stablecoins . This could involve creating its own stablecoin or facilitating access to existing ones. Santander’s Openbank, which serves customers across multiple European countries, is poised to launch these crypto services as early as this year, contingent on obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals , according to Bloomberg. This move comes as Santander’s Spanish competitor, BBVA SA, announced in March its intention to offer cryptocurrency services following approval from Spain’s regulatory authority, the CNMV. BBVA has already been providing similar services in Switzerland and Turkey, allowing customers to buy, sell, and manage transactions in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) through their app. How BBVA Aims To Guide Customers In Crypto Assets Gonzalo Rodríguez, BBVA’s head of retail banking in Spain, emphasized the bank’s commitment to making cryptocurrency investment accessible, stating, “Our goal is to guide them as they explore this new segment of digital assets, backed by the solvency and security assurances provided by a bank like BBVA.” The MiCA regulation aims to harmonize the currently fragmented regulatory landscape across the European Union’s (EU) 27 member states. By establishing a comprehensive framework, the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets is shaping how major digital market participants operate within one of the world’s largest economic regions. The regulation allows banks, investment firms, and other financial institutions to engage in cryptocurrency activities, provided they have the necessary authorization under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) II. Such a move comes in the wake of growing legislative support in the US led by President Donald Trump, who has increasingly changed its previous vision about digital assets and Bitcoin with major announcements, including the establishment of a Strategic Crypto Reserve. As such, Bitcoin reached a new record high of $111,800 last week, with analysts and investors vowing to see even greater gains in the coming months. Consequently, the total crypto market capitalization reached a new high of $3.5 trillion last week, now standing at $3.3 trillion as investors flock to cash out their gains.

2025-05-30T17:00:36.000Z,"Analyst: Cardano To $10 In 2025? These 5 Catalysts Could Ignite ADA","Cardano staking pool operator (SPO) Sssebi (@Av_Sebastian) has ignited a debate by asserting that Cardano’s ADA could reach double-digit territory this year. In a thread that began, “These are the ingredients for $10 $ADA in 2025,” he listed five developments he believes will transform the eighth-largest cryptocurrency from a $0.70 token into a $10 asset. Each of those “ingredients” is now taking shape—and each comes with its own uncertainties. #1 Cardano Becomes Bitcoin’s DeFi Layer At the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Input Output (IO) stunned attendees by moving a live Bitcoin Ordinal across a new BitVM-based bridge to Cardano. IO called the demonstration “a preview of what is to come,” adding that the “Cardinal” protocol aims for full integration so BTC holders can lend, borrow and stake inside Cardano’s extended-UTxO environment. By transplanting Bitcoin liquidity onto a programmable ledger without wrapped custodial tokens, Cardano positions itself as a settlement layer for so-called BTCFi applications—an addressable market that today tops $1 trillion in dormant value. Related Reading: Cardano: Elliot Wave Predicts 50% Crash For ADA Price, Is It Time To Get Out #2 The Midnight “Glacier Drop” Airdrop Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson told Consensus 2025 in Toronto that Midnight, his privacy-focused sidechain, will airdrop both NIGHT governance tokens and DUST privacy tokens to “approximately 37 million wallets across eight major blockchains”—with “zero allocation to venture capitalists.” “Every Consensus there’s a new token saying, ‘my thing is better,’” he said. “We’re going to give this away and let users decide.” The sheer scale dwarfs recent airdrops and could seed tens of millions of new ADA-capable addresses once Midnight’s cross-chain fee model pushes traffic back to the base chain. #3 A US Listed Cardano Spot ETF In February NYSE Arca filed to convert the Grayscale Cardano Trust into a spot ETF. The Securities and Exchange Commission acknowledged the application on 24 February, starting a 240-day clock that now runs to 22 October 2025. The agency’s first-phase deadline of 29 May was pushed to 15 July, following the pattern that preceded January’s Bitcoin ETF approvals. Grayscale has argued that ADA’s on-chain transparency and staking mechanics make it “substantially resistant to manipulation,” echoing the language that ultimately persuaded regulators on Bitcoin. An approval would give traditional investors a regulated conduit to stake-enabled yield—something no US crypto ETF yet offers.

A subsequent Truth Social post surprised markets by naming “XRP, Solana and Cardano” for inclusion alongside Bitcoin and Ether; ADA jumped more than 70% intraday. Though the order bars fresh purchases of altcoins, Treasury accounting shows roughly $493 million in non-Bitcoin assets—ADA among them—already earmarked. Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov called the move “a reputational boost, signaling the US. views digital assets as strategic.” Inclusion in a sovereign reserve legitimises ADA for conservative allocators and could ease the path for futures and options listings. #5 The Ouroboros Leios Upgrade Hoskinson labels Leios “the capstone of the entire Ouroboros agenda … the fastest cryptocurrency on the planet.” In a May 1 livestream he said simulations show “tens of thousands of transactions per second” without sacrificing decentralization. The upgrade introduces parallel input, ranking and endorsement blocks, allowing throughput to be dialed up as adoption demands. If main-net integration lands in H2 2025, Leios would coincide with Midnight’s launch and the ETF review window—an alignment bulls see as catalytic. ADA trades near $0.70 today, implying a market capitalization of roughly $25 billion. A jump to $10 would push valuation toward $350 billion, rivaling Ethereum’s 2024 peak.

2025-05-30T16:55:51.000Z,"US Authorities Sanction Philippines-Based Firm for Allegedly Providing Computer Infrastructure for Crypto Pig Butchering Scams","The U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is taking action against a Philippines-based company accused of facilitating a popular crypto investment scam. In a statement, the Treasury Department says that Funnull Technology Inc. is facing US sanctions for allegedly providing computer infrastructure to hundreds of thousands of websites engaged in pig butchering scams. Perpetrators of pig butchering scams use fake identities to build online relationships with unsuspecting individuals with the aim of introducing them to fraudulent cryptocurrency investment opportunities. Criminal organizations based in Southeast Asia largely carry out the scheme by exploiting victims of human trafficking. Funnull purportedly buys IP addresses from major cloud services companies and sells these to cybercriminals to host scam platforms and malicious websites. The company also provides services that make it easier for bad actors to impersonate trusted brands and allow them to quickly change to a different domain name and IP address when the legitimate providers attempt to take the websites down. In 2014, Funnull bought and altered a repository of codes used by web developers to redirect visitors of legitimate sites to scam and online gambling sites, some of which are associated with Chinese criminal money laundering operations. The Treasury Department says that Funnull has ties to the majority of the crypto investment scam websites that were reported to the FBI. US-based victims claim losing over $200 million to these schemes, or an average of $150,000 per individual. The OFAC is also imposing sanctions against Funnull’s administrator, Chinese national Liu Lizhi, who was in possession of documents that contain information about the company’s employees, including their performance and progress on tasks.

Wynn announced he is back with another 40X long on BTC. James Wynn is back with another leveraged position on Hyperliquid, just hours after closing all previous long positions and absorbing the losses. Wynn renewed his attempt to break into a $1B earnings from leveraged trading, a stunt that would boost both his personal profile and the influence of Hyperliquid. The new risky position fluctuated between temporary loss and gain, once again attracting the attention of BTC traders for counter-positions or attempts at liquidation. | Source: Hyperliquid After high-stakes trading, which was seen as a deliberate attempt to liquidate Wynn’s position, he initially gave signs of capitulating. Wynn round-tripped his initial 40X leveraged position, up to $82M in unrealized profit and down to $100M loss. Wynn’s moves are extremely risky, but he has made multiple previous attempts at trading. Currently, Wynn’s positions spark counter-trading, as well as potential attempts to sway the price of BTC and liquidate the position. Just these for now Hoping BTC pulls lower but i don’t see it pic.twitter.com/wd9751v27t — James Wynn 🐳 (@JamesWynnReal) May 30, 2025 Wynn’s positions aim to make up the loss in one trade and depend on a dramatic move by BTC. Currently, the open positions on BTC and kPEPE are in the green, with a liquidation price of $102,630 for BTC. James Wynn took the new position as BTC traded around $105,581, preparing for the monthly close. BTC is up 11.66% for the month to date, performing similarly to May 2024 with 11.06% gains. However, last-minute shifts may threaten Wynn’s positions and lead to partial closing or an outright liquidation. The crypto community is either rooting for Wynn to perform his feat of winning the perpetual DEX casino or to see his position liquidated. Despite the outcome, Wynn has turned into a factor for BTC sentiment. Wynn’s position added to the $6.9B in open interest on Hyperliquid, which became the 13th largest derivative exchange. The risky trades keep boosting the exposure for the perpetual DEX, which aims for a top spot next to some of the largest centralized markets. James Wynn continues building a reputation of reckless trading Wynn continued building his reputation as the most reckless trader, once again with the potential to sway the BTC market. Wynn’s position appeared at a time when BTC was still choosing direction, with most traders showing a bullish sentiment. The new liquidation price raises the matter of another ‘whale hunt’ and attempts to crash BTC to the liquidation position. Despite this, Wynn is again not shy about his public position, which is immediately advertised on social media. Wynn’s actions themselves are becoming a sentiment signal for the crypto market. The risky trades aim to match the overall sentiment and are sometimes extremely successful. At other times, Wynn has allowed the positions to be liquidated or has deliberately closed them. Wynn switches to meme tokens Following the $100M loss, Wynn did not skip a beat, but continued to shill his latest meme token, MoonPig. Within hours, MOONPIG tripled its price from $0.01 to $0.03. The Moonpig token only promoted itself with an idle game, awarding tokens to its leaderboard. However, Wynn’s effect on the price is another testament to the trader’s influence. Wynn has minimal meme token holdings on Hyperliquid, recently also showing interest in PURR, FARM, VAPOR, and BUDDY. The trader’s moves helped boost HYPE, the native token of Hyperliquid. HYPE recovered to $32.62, still close to its all-time high above $39.

2025-05-30T16:37:25.000Z,"Bitcoin (BTC) Profit-Taking Still Modest, No Sign of Bull Run Ending","With Bitcoin trading below $106,000, some participants are opting to cash out partial holdings, looking to lock in profits amid the crypto asset’s impressive price performance in the past month or so. While this raises concerns of early signs of a trend reversal, new data revealed the sustainability of the rally. NRPL Signals Continued Optimism According to CryptoQuant’s latest analysis , the Net Realized Profit/Loss (NRPL) metric shows that while BTC investors are realizing some profits following the recent price surge, the scale of these sales remains modest compared to past market peaks. The current level suggests a possible short-term correction, but not one strong enough to reverse the broader bullish trend. In contrast to the significant NRPL spikes seen during previous cycle tops in March and November 2024, the present level of profit-taking is relatively low. This indicates that most investors are still holding rather than selling in large numbers. Based on this analysis, there is little evidence to suggest the upward cycle is ending. The current market behavior points to continued strength in Bitcoin’s rally, with no clear signs of a transition into a downtrend. Whale Buys and BCMI Jump Support Accumulation Thesis Accumulation trends among certain major Bitcoin holders are becoming increasingly evident. For instance, addresses holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC, excluding exchanges and miners, are increasing , indicating large holder accumulation. This trend reflects growing investor confidence, which has historically been associated with rising Bitcoin prices. In fact, in the last 48 hours alone, whales have bought over 20,000 BTC, according to an update shared by crypto analyst Ali Martinez. Additionally, CryptoQuant’s BCMI has climbed sharply, with the 7-day SMA reaching 0.6 by May 29th – an early signal of potential market upside. The 90-day SMA remains at 0.45, which is indicative of a stable and non-overheated environment. This composite index includes metrics like MVRV, NUPL, SOPR, and sentiment indicators to assess cycle positioning. With profit realization slowing and stronger on-chain signals emerging, the market may be entering the early stages of an accumulation phase.

2025-05-30T16:15:22.000Z,"Crypto-Assets and Financial Stability: The Bank of Italy’s Call for Caution","The Bank of Italy on Friday sounded a clear warning about the deepening ties between crypto-assets and the traditional financial system, warning of the risks crypto could pose to financial stability. Governor Fabio Panetta stressed the urgent need for a coordinated and comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets, especially as they become increasingly integrated into mainstream finance. A Risky Integration with Traditional Finance Governor Panetta noted the growing number of agreements between crypto firms and financial intermediaries. A growing number of large, publicly traded U.S. firms now park substantial Bitcoin holdings on their balance sheets, putting everyday investors on the hook for the coin’s sharp price swings. At the same time, the boom in Bitcoin exchange-traded funds has woven crypto even more tightly into traditional markets. Panetta cautioned that this overlap comes with serious dangers. Unlike standard financial assets, most cryptocurrencies—including Bitcoin—have no underlying value and can swing wildly in price. Since they are typically traded on lightly regulated, opaque platforms, these assets could set off shocks that reverberate through the wider financial system. Stablecoins and Systemic Threats Panetta also focused on the emergence of stablecoins—digital assets designed to maintain value relative to fiat currencies or other assets. While they seek to offer price stability, their utility as a payment instrument remains questionable in the absence of robust regulation. Risks related to issuer reliability and the underlying collateral persist, raising concerns for consumers and regulators alike. The Governor warned that if major global tech companies were to adopt stablecoins for payments across their platforms, they could create powerful, systemically important networks beyond the reach of national regulators. These shifts could erode governments’ control over their own currencies, put people’s data at risk, and upend core banking services such as lending. Panetta also warned that the anonymity built into many crypto-assets makes them attractive for bad actors, who could use them to launder money, trade illegally, or dodge international sanctions. MiCA: Strengthening Rules for Safer Crypto Markets Governor Panetta noted the importance of regulatory progress in Europe, pointing to the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) as a step toward a safer and more transparent digital asset market. He noted that MiCA introduces clearer rules designed to protect consumers and ensure the orderly development of crypto markets. The regulation distinguishes between different types of stablecoins, granting payment legitimacy only to those backed by a single official currency, referred to as electronic money tokens (EMTs). According to Panetta, only these EMTs offer sufficient safeguards to qualify as a reliable means of payment under the new framework. Italy’s Central Bank Engages Crypto Firms Italy’s central bank and securities regulator have been in active discussions with crypto service providers to ensure robust financial and cybersecurity safeguards.

Shiba Inu and Bitcoin Correlation Notably, Shiba Inu has closely followed Bitcoin’s price action in recent times. The canine-themed token sometimes outperforms or underperforms Bitcoin’s performance. For instance, if Bitcoin experiences a gain of 2%, SHIB could register an increase of 5% and vice versa.Shiba Inu’s high correlation with Bitcoin majorly drives this. According to data from IntoTheBlock, Shiba Inu has a 30-day correlation of 72% with Bitcoin. Notably, Shiba Inu boasts a higher correlation with Bitcoin over the past 60 days, with the figure standing at 86%. Given Shiba Inu’s strong correlation with Bitcoin, BTC will likely influence SHIB’s price action more. In this case, an upsurge in Bitcoin would translate to a proportional or higher growth for SHIB and vice versa. Shiba Inu Price if Bitcoin Hit $4,878,819 By 2040The good news is that several analysts are anticipating a major price surge for Bitcoin. One of such predictions came from experts affiliated with Changelly. The experts predicted that one Bitcoin would be worth $4,878,819 ($4.87 million) by 2040, nearly 15 years from now. Specifically, Changelly sets the $4.87 million price as Bitcoin’s average target by January 2040. This represents a 4,400% increase from Bitcoin’s current price of $105,418. ChatGPT referenced Changelly’s 2040 forecast for Bitcoin to project how much Shiba Inu could be worth if the doggy-themed token experiences proportional growth. The AI chatbot suggests that applying the 4,400% growth rate to Shiba Inu’s current price would push it to $0.000632. Shiba Inu Price if Bitcoin hits $487M by 2040 l ChatGPT Shiba Inu Price if Bitcoin hits $487M by 2040, ChatGPT Assuming SHIB’s circulating supply remains unchanged at 589.25 trillion tokens, Shiba Inu’s projected rise to the $0.000632 target would push the asset’s market cap to $372.4 billion from $8.27 billion. Grok 2040 Prediction for Shiba Inu Meanwhile, AI model Grok referenced different 2040 predictions from multiple entities, such as Changelly, Telegaon, CoinCodex, and Coinpedia Markets, to estimate what SHIB could be worth in the next 15 years. Based on these predictions, Grok forecasted a conservative target price range of $0.00001911 to $0.054 for Shiba Inu by 2040. It also predicted an average price range of $0.00002157 - $0.076 and highly optimistic targets of $0.0000310 - $0.089. Besides SHIB’s correlation with Bitcoin, Grok expects multiple factors, such as token burns, positive ecosystem developments, and bullish market sentiment, to influence Shiba Inu’s 2040 price action. In the meantime, Grok urged investors to approach its 2040 Shiba Inu forecast with caution, given the unpredictable nature of the crypto market.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/05/30/heres-how-high-shiba-inu-can-rise-if-bitcoin-hits-4878819-by-2040/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=heres-how-high-shiba-inu-can-rise-if-bitcoin-hits-4878819-by-2040,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING","Market|Latest Shiba Inu (SHIB) News Today|Shiba Inu Price Prediction",cryptocompare

This news comes as Bitcoin (BTC) continues to trade below its all-time high of approximately $111,800, currently priced around $105,503 amid a modest decline of 1.57% in 24 hours and 3.56% over the past week. Meanwhile, significant on-chain movements point to an ongoing trend of Bitcoin moving away from exchanges. Specifically, recent data from Lookonchain highlights two newly created wallets receiving major withdrawals from Binance’s hot wallet, signaling a potential change in holder behavior.Significant Binance Withdrawals to New WalletsLookonchain reported that around 09:21:13 UTC, two newly established Bitcoin wallets each withdrew about 400 BTC from Binance’s hot wallet. https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1928430054737928224These transactions amount to 800 BTC total, equating to around $84.2 million at current prices near $105,616 per BTC. The wallets , holding 400 BTC each, signify a considerable transfer of funds out of Binance custody. This activity drew attention given the size and timing, as large withdrawals to new wallets often suggest intentions to store BTC privately or prepare for long-term holding.The movement from exchange wallets to new addresses typically indicates reduced selling pressure on the market. It may also reflect large institutional investors or private holders shifting Bitcoin off exchanges to cold storage. This pattern matches recent trends showing lower Bitcoin inflows to exchanges.Declining Exchange Inflows Notably, IntoTheBlock’s on-chain flow volume data for Bitcoin over the past three months reveals notable fluctuations. However, a distinct downward trend in BTC inflows to exchanges has emerged recently, with a 9.5% drop over the last 24 hours and a 16.99% decline over the past week. This data aligns with the significant withdrawals from Binance, suggesting that holders prefer moving Bitcoin off exchanges rather than depositing it. Exchange Inflow Volume Exchange Inflow Volume Notably, despite this recent decline, the 30-day inflow volume shows a positive change of 9.43%. The overall reduction in inflows in the short term supports the idea that Bitcoin holders might be accumulating or storing coins long term, instead of preparing for quick sales. This behavior corresponds with the movement of large amounts of BTC into new wallets, marking a shift towards holding rather than active trading.Long-Term Holders Not Ready to Sell Supporting the holder accumulation narrative, further data from reveals that long-term holders (LTHs) have increased their BTC supply significantly between March 3 and May 25, 2025. The LTH supply rose from about 14.35 million BTC to roughly 15.74 million BTC, marking a net gain of over 1.39 million BTC in under three months. This accumulation trend continues despite Bitcoin’s price consolidation near current levels.This trend contrasts with previous market cycles, such as those in 2013, 2017, and 2021, where LTH supply typically fell during bull runs as holders sold for profits. Analysts note that recent brief dips in LTH supply during May 2024 and March 2025 did not reverse the upward trend. These observations suggest that experienced holders are refraining from selling at current price points, potentially reducing the available supply for newer market participants.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/05/30/two-new-bitcoin-wallets-withdraw-84-2m-in-btc-from-binance-whats-happening/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=two-new-bitcoin-wallets-withdraw-84-2m-in-btc-from-binance-whats-happening,"BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB","Market|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today",cryptocompare
2025-05-30T15:50:15.000Z,"Unstoppable Bitcoin Rally: Why Profit Taking Signals Continued Growth","BitcoinWorld Unstoppable Bitcoin Rally: Why Profit Taking Signals Continued Growth Is the recent uptick in profit taking by long-term Bitcoin holders a sign that the current Bitcoin rally is running out of steam? For many observers, seeing large amounts of Bitcoin move after significant price increases triggers alarm bells, conjuring fears of a market top. However, according to insights from leading crypto analytics firm Santiment, this particular instance of profit taking might be a fundamentally different signal – one that actually supports the continuation of the bullish trend in the crypto market . Understanding Holder Behavior in the Crypto Market In any market, understanding the actions of participants is crucial. In the volatile crypto market , deciphering holder behavior can offer unique insights into potential future price movements. Santiment, known for its on-chain data analysis, points to a specific metric that sheds light on what long-term holders are doing: the Mean Dollar Invested Age (MDIA). What exactly is MDIA? It’s a metric that calculates the average age of all Bitcoin on the network, weighted by the price at which each coin last moved. Think of it as tracking how long, on average, investors have held onto their Bitcoin without selling or moving it. When MDIA increases, it suggests that coins are sitting idle in wallets, indicating accumulation or HODLing behavior. When MDIA decreases, it means older coins are being moved, typically signifying selling or spending by those who acquired Bitcoin some time ago. Santiment’s recent data shows a notable decline in Bitcoin’s MDIA since roughly mid-April. This decline is the key indicator of increased coin circulation, driven by holders who have been in the market for a while – the ones now engaging in profit taking . Why Profit Taking Might Fuel the Bitcoin Rally Traditionally, a decrease in MDIA due to selling might be seen as bearish. However, Santiment argues that a falling MDIA during an ongoing bull market is historically a strong bullish indicator. This seems counter-intuitive at first glance, but here’s the logic: When long-term holders, who bought Bitcoin at much lower prices, start selling, they are essentially taking profits. This action does several things that can sustain a Bitcoin rally : Provides Liquidity: Their selling provides the necessary supply for new buyers entering the market or existing holders wanting to increase their position. This prevents the rally from stalling due to a lack of available coins at current prices. Redistributes Supply: Bitcoin moves from ‘old hands’ to ‘new hands’. If the new buyers are accumulating with a long-term perspective, this fresh capital and renewed conviction can add momentum. Prevents Overheating (Initially): Unlike speculative short-term traders who might panic sell at the first sign of trouble, long-term holders selling into strength can create healthy pullbacks or consolidations, preventing the market from becoming excessively parabolic and prone to a sharp crash. It’s a more controlled distribution. Confirms Price Levels: The fact that there is sufficient demand to absorb the selling pressure from profitable holders validates the current Bitcoin price levels and builds a stronger foundation for further increases. Santiment emphasizes that this type of circulation, where older coins move, is characteristic of healthy bull markets where value is being transferred and new capital is entering. It’s distinct from a scenario where short-term holders are rapidly trading back and forth, which can indicate frothiness and potential tops. Is This Holder Behavior Different This Time? Every market cycle has unique characteristics, but the underlying principles of holder behavior often rhyme. The current decline in MDIA suggests that the long-term conviction that defined the earlier stages of accumulation is now transitioning into strategic distribution by those who have held for years. This is a natural phase in a bull market. Consider the alternative: if MDIA continued to rise indefinitely during a rally, it would mean virtually no one is selling. While this might sound bullish (extreme HODLing), it would actually make the market illiquid, leading to extremely volatile price spikes followed by potential crashes when the inevitable selling eventually occurs from fewer, larger holders. The current pattern, according to Santiment’s analysis, suggests a more sustainable, albeit potentially choppy, ascent for the Bitcoin price . Key Takeaways and Actionable Insights For those navigating the crypto market , understanding metrics like MDIA and the implications of profit taking by different types of holders is invaluable. Here are some actionable insights: Look Beyond Simple Price Action: Don’t just react to price dips or large sell orders. Investigate the underlying on-chain data. Monitor MDIA: A falling MDIA during a bull trend is often a positive sign, indicating healthy market activity rather than capitulation. Distinguish Holder Types: Recognize that selling by long-term holders can have a different market impact than selling by short-term speculators. Stay Informed: Follow analyses from reputable firms like Santiment to get deeper insights into market dynamics beyond basic charts. While no single metric guarantees future performance, the MDIA provides a powerful lens through which to view the current Bitcoin rally . It suggests that the recent increase in coin movement isn’t a red flag waving goodbye to the bull market, but potentially the necessary fuel to keep the engine running. Conclusion: Why Profit Taking May Sustain the Rally In conclusion, the recent trend of profit taking observed among Bitcoin holders, as indicated by the declining Mean Dollar Invested Age (MDIA), appears to be a constructive development for the ongoing Bitcoin rally . Rather than signaling an impending top, this movement of older coins into circulation provides essential liquidity, facilitates redistribution to new market participants, and helps create a more stable foundation for the rising Bitcoin price within the broader crypto market . By analyzing metrics like MDIA and understanding the nuances of holder behavior , investors can gain a clearer perspective on the market’s health and potential trajectory, recognizing that sometimes, selling isn’t a sign of weakness, but a necessary component of continued growth.

2025-05-30T15:48:06.000Z,"HOT MOMENTS: Donald Trump Accuses China of Violating the Tariff Agreement – White House Releases a Statement","US President Donald Trump has slammed Beijing, saying that China has “completely violated” the tariff agreement it made with the US. “Maybe it’s not surprising to some, but China has completely violated the agreement it made with us,” Trump said. White House official Miller also supported Trump's statements. Miller said, “We have a wide range of options to hold China accountable,” and indicated that the US could take new steps against Beijing. Miller also said that they would not allow China to take away US production capacity and that espionage activities carried out through student visas would be stopped. Related News: And the Deal is Done: Trump's Company Announces Bitcoin Move Arguing that China has not fulfilled its commitments with the US, Miller said, “China must demonstrate its commitment to the rules-based international order.” Miller conveyed that President Trump hopes that China will choose the path of “cooperation and common ground.” The Chinese Embassy in Washington responded to these statements by the US. The embassy spokesperson said, “China calls on the US to end discriminatory restrictions and jointly protect the consensus reached at the high-level talks in Geneva.” China and the United States continue to maintain contacts on various occasions at the bilateral and multilateral levels in the economic and trade fields, and both sides have expressed their concerns, the spokesman said. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-30T15:45:42.000Z,"Reform UK Embraces Bitcoin as Farage Outlines Sweeping Crypto Agenda","Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has announced that his party will begin accepting political donations in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, marking a first for a British political party. The move comes alongside promises of sweeping crypto legislation if his party comes to power. Crypto Donations Go Live Speaking at the Bitcoin Conference in Las Vegas, where he was introduced as a “UK presidential candidate,” Farage confirmed that Reform UK is now able to accept cryptocurrency donations from eligible UK donors. The party’s website was updated on Thursday evening to facilitate the new payment option. Farage declared, “As of now, provided you are an eligible UK donor… we are the first political party in Britain that can accept donations in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.” A Reform UK spokesperson later confirmed that additional details about the initiative would be released on Friday. Legislative Vision for a ‘Crypto Powerhouse’ Farage outlined a broader crypto policy agenda, stating that his party intends to introduce a cryptoassets and digital finance bill. Central to this would be a proposal to slash capital gains tax on crypto assets from the current 24% to 10%. In addition to tax reforms, the proposed legislation would prohibit banks from debanking customers solely for interacting with digital assets. Farage also reaffirmed his opposition to a British central bank digital currency (CBDC), distancing Reform UK from the idea of a state-issued digital pound. A notable aspect of the party’s crypto platform includes establishing a Bitcoin reserve within the Bank of England. Farage described this measure as part of his vision to transform the UK into a major global crypto hub. Context and Industry Response Farage’s announcement arrives amid ongoing debates within UK financial circles about how best to regulate digital assets. Just weeks earlier, Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves had unveiled draft legislation aimed at regulating cryptocurrency firms under frameworks similar to traditional financial institutions. Meanwhile, MPs on the Treasury Select Committee have controversially called for crypto assets to be regulated as gambling products, warning of the high risk of investor losses. The UK Treasury, however, rejected this recommendation, stating it did not support applying gambling laws to cryptocurrency. Longstanding Crypto Advocacy Farage’s stance on digital assets is not new. He has advocated for cryptocurrencies since 2020, when he highlighted the vulnerabilities of fiat currencies and described Bitcoin as the best “anti-lockdown investment” during the pandemic. At the Las Vegas event, he praised the US approach to digital assets as “nothing short of fantastic” and expressed ambitions to position London as one of the world’s leading crypto trading centres. With the next UK general election slated for 2029, Reform UK’s pro-crypto platform and its acceptance of Bitcoin donations position it as a distinctive voice in the country’s evolving digital finance landscape.
