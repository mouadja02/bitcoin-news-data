2025-05-30T06:59:07.000Z,"Fed Chair Tells Trump That Monetary Policy Is Based on ‘Non-Political Analysis’ After Wave of Criticism From the President","U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell met with President Donald Trump following the White House’s broadsides against the Fed’s monetary policy choices. The Fed, however, noted in a statement following the meeting that Powell did not discuss interest rate expectations with the president. “At the President’s invitation, Chair Powell met with the President today at the White House to discuss economic developments including for growth, employment, and inflation. Chair Powell did not discuss his expectations for monetary policy, except to stress that the path of policy will depend entirely on incoming economic information and what that means for the outlook. Finally, Chair Powell said that he and his colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will set monetary policy, as required by law, to support maximum employment and stable prices and will make those decisions based solely on careful, objective, and non-political analysis.” Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell for not slashing interest rates, saying earlier this month that communicating with the Fed chair is “like talking to a wall.” “The Bank of England cut. China cut. Everybody’s cutting but him. I don’t know, we’ll see what happens. It’s a shame. I call him ‘Too Late.’ Too Late Powell, that’s his nickname. And it’s a shame, it’s ridiculous… he’s always too late. But in this case, it’s not going to matter that much because our country is so strong, we’re so powerful in terms of economic strength and what we’ve done.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

On Wednesday, the United States Court of International Trade (CIT) ruled that many of Donald Trump’s tariffs exceed the authority granted to the president by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The federal court struck down Trump’s April 2nd executive order establishing tariffs against 57 countries worldwide and several follow-up executive orders modifying the duties’ rates and start dates. The CIT also axed a slew of earlier tariffs Trump had applied to Mexico, Canada and China, which he claimed were retaliation for failing to stop the flood of illegal narcotics into the US. The Trump Administration immediately appealed the CIT’s ruling and requested a stay on the judgment, which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit granted . White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt blasted the CIT’s ruling on Thursday, arguing that Trump’s “sensitive diplomatic and trade negotiations” were being “derailed by activist judges.” Equities largely tracked sideways throughout the legal drama, with the S&P 500 ticking up 0.4% on Thursday and the Nasdaq Composite jumping by 0.39%. Crypto witnessed a dip, with the overall digital asset cap dropping by 2.7%, per data from CoinGecko .

2025-05-30T06:50:40.000Z,"PSG Bitcoin Reserve: French Football Giant Makes Bold Crypto Move","BitcoinWorld PSG Bitcoin Reserve: French Football Giant Makes Bold Crypto Move The world of professional sports just got a significant jolt from the world of digital assets. French football powerhouse Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) has reportedly made a groundbreaking move, establishing a PSG Bitcoin Reserve . This development, initially reported by BeInCrypto, positions the Ligue 1 champions at the forefront of integrating cryptocurrency into traditional institutional finance within the sports sector. While many sports teams and leagues have dipped their toes into the crypto space through fan tokens, sponsorships, or NFTs, PSG’s reported decision to hold Bitcoin directly on its balance sheet is a distinct and potentially transformative step. It signals a level of confidence in Bitcoin as a store of value and a strategic asset. What Exactly is a Sports Team Bitcoin Reserve? In traditional finance, companies and institutions often hold reserves in various assets, primarily fiat currency, but also potentially in gold, real estate, or other stable investments, to manage liquidity, hedge against inflation, or diversify their holdings. A Sports Team Bitcoin reserve means the club is choosing to allocate a portion of its treasury funds directly into Bitcoin. This differs significantly from other crypto activities we’ve seen in sports: Fan Tokens: These are cryptocurrencies specifically for fans, offering voting rights, rewards, and access to exclusive content. They are primarily a fan engagement and revenue-generating tool, not a treasury management strategy. Sponsorships: Crypto exchanges or projects sponsoring teams provides marketing for the crypto entity and revenue for the team, but the team doesn’t necessarily hold the sponsored cryptocurrency. NFTs: Non-fungible tokens representing digital collectibles are another revenue stream and fan engagement method, not a direct investment in a core cryptocurrency like Bitcoin for treasury purposes. By establishing a PSG Bitcoin Reserve , the club is making an investment decision about its own corporate treasury, similar to how some major corporations have started holding Bitcoin. Why Would a Football Club Embrace Institutional Bitcoin Adoption? PSG’s move into holding Institutional Bitcoin is likely driven by several strategic considerations: 1. Inflation Hedge: Like many corporations exploring Bitcoin, PSG may view BTC as a potential hedge against inflation and the devaluation of traditional fiat currencies. Holding a scarce digital asset could preserve purchasing power over the long term. 2. Asset Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to their treasury diversifies their holdings beyond traditional financial instruments, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk (though introducing crypto-specific volatility). 3. Innovation and Brand Image: Aligning with cutting-edge technology like Bitcoin can enhance PSG’s brand image as innovative and forward-thinking. This resonates with a younger, globally connected, and tech-savvy fanbase. 4. Potential for Appreciation: While volatile, Bitcoin has shown significant long-term appreciation potential. A successful investment could directly benefit the club’s financial health. 5. Attracting a Global Digital Audience: Embracing Bitcoin connects PSG with the vast and growing global cryptocurrency community, potentially attracting new fans and commercial opportunities in digital markets. This step into Institutional Bitcoin by a major football club is a powerful signal to the market and other traditional institutions. Is PSG Truly the First Crypto Sports Pioneer in This Way? The claim that PSG is the first sports organization to introduce a Bitcoin reserve needs careful consideration. While many sports entities are involved with crypto, holding Bitcoin directly on the balance sheet for treasury purposes is indeed less common than fan tokens or sponsorships. Major corporations like MicroStrategy and Tesla famously added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, pioneering the ‘corporate treasury’ use case. PSG appears to be the first major professional sports *team* to publicly announce such a move specifically for Bitcoin reserves. Other sports entities might have exposure to crypto through investments in blockchain companies or receiving payments in crypto, but a dedicated ‘Bitcoin reserve’ signals a deliberate strategy to hold BTC as a primary treasury asset. This distinction is crucial and positions PSG as a notable pioneer in the intersection of Crypto Sports and corporate finance. Benefits and Challenges of a Football Club Crypto Strategy Adopting a Football Club Crypto strategy, particularly one involving holding volatile assets like Bitcoin, comes with potential rewards and significant risks. Potential Benefits: Financial Upside: If Bitcoin appreciates, the value of the reserve increases, boosting the club’s assets. Enhanced Reputation: Seen as innovative and aligned with future technology trends. New Revenue Streams: Opens doors for crypto-related partnerships and fan engagement initiatives. Global Reach: Connects with the worldwide crypto community. Potential Challenges and Risks: Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can fluctuate dramatically, potentially leading to significant paper losses on the reserve. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Security Risks: Holding significant amounts of crypto requires robust security measures against hacking and theft. Public Perception: Fluctuations in the reserve’s value could attract negative media attention or fan scrutiny. Accounting Complexity: Accounting for cryptocurrency holdings can be complex under current standards. Any Football Club Crypto strategy involving treasury reserves requires careful risk management and a long-term perspective. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Sports ? PSG’s reported move could be a watershed moment for Crypto Sports integration. If successful, it could inspire other major sports clubs and organizations across football, basketball, baseball, and other leagues to explore similar strategies. We might see a trend where: More teams consider holding Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as part of their treasury management. Crypto assets become more integrated into sports finance beyond just marketing and fan engagement. Competition increases among teams to be seen as technologically advanced and appealing to the digital generation. New financial products and services emerge specifically for sports organizations dealing with crypto. This development underscores the increasing convergence of the traditional financial world, institutional investment, and the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market, now reaching into the mainstream world of global sports. Actionable Insights for Fans and Investors For fans, this news highlights PSG’s commitment to innovation and potentially offers new ways to engage with the club in the future, perhaps through crypto-enabled platforms or services tied to the club’s digital strategy. For crypto investors, PSG’s move is another data point indicating growing institutional adoption of Bitcoin. While one team’s investment is not a guarantee of future price movements, it adds to the narrative of Bitcoin gaining acceptance as a legitimate asset class among diverse institutions. It’s a reminder that the integration of crypto into mainstream sectors is accelerating, creating both opportunities and the need for continued education and careful consideration of risks. A Bold Step into the Digital Future Paris Saint-Germain’s reported establishment of a PSG Bitcoin Reserve marks a bold and significant step. As potentially the first major sports team to directly hold Bitcoin as a treasury asset, they are navigating uncharted territory within the sports industry. This move reflects a growing confidence in Bitcoin among institutions and signals a potential shift in how major sports organizations manage their finances and engage with the digital economy. While challenges exist, the potential benefits in terms of diversification, inflation hedging, and brand innovation are clear. The world will be watching to see if other clubs follow PSG’s lead, further solidifying the link between Crypto Sports and the future of finance.

2025-05-30T06:50:19.000Z,"Urgent Showdown: Trump Pushes Fed Interest Rates Down, Powell Defends Independence","BitcoinWorld Urgent Showdown: Trump Pushes Fed Interest Rates Down, Powell Defends Independence For anyone navigating the dynamic world of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies, understanding the pulse of global economic policy is absolutely crucial. Why? Because decisions made in boardrooms like the Federal Reserve can send ripples that significantly influence the volatility and direction of the crypto market impact . A recent meeting between former President Donald Trump and current Fed Chair Jerome Powell brought this connection into sharp focus, highlighting the ongoing tension between political desires and central bank autonomy regarding Fed interest rates . The Meeting: Trump’s Call vs. Powell’s Stance on Fed Interest Rates On May 29, U.S. President Donald Trump met with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell . The core of Trump’s message was clear: he urged the Fed to cut Fed interest rates . His rationale, as reported by Yonhap News Agency, centered on the need for the U.S. to remain globally competitive. Lower interest rates can potentially weaken a nation’s currency, making its exports cheaper and potentially stimulating economic activity. However, Chair Powell’s response was equally firm. He reiterated the Federal Reserve’s long-standing commitment to making decisions based purely on economic data and without political influence. This principle of Fed independence is considered vital for maintaining stability and credibility in monetary policy. The Fed’s dual mandate is typically focused on maximizing employment and stabilizing prices (controlling inflation), not necessarily global competitiveness based on currency strength. Understanding Monetary Policy and Why it Matters to Crypto At its heart, monetary policy refers to the actions undertaken by a central bank, like the U.S. Federal Reserve, to manipulate the money supply and credit conditions to stimulate or constrain economic activity. The primary tool for this is often setting a target range for the federal funds rate – the interest rate banks charge each other for overnight lending. This rate influences borrowing costs throughout the economy, from mortgages and car loans to business investments. Here’s a simple breakdown of how monetary policy typically works and its potential effects: Lowering Interest Rates: This makes borrowing cheaper. Businesses might invest more, consumers might spend more (e.g., on homes or cars). This stimulates economic growth but can also lead to inflation if the economy overheats. It can also make traditional, low-yield investments less attractive. Raising Interest Rates: This makes borrowing more expensive. Businesses and consumers may reduce spending and investment. This slows down economic growth, helping to cool inflation. It can make traditional, safer investments (like bonds or savings accounts) more appealing due to higher yields. So, where does crypto fit in? Cryptocurrencies are often considered risk assets. When traditional investment yields are low (due to low interest rates), investors might look for higher returns in alternative markets, including crypto. Conversely, when interest rates rise, safer investments offer better returns, potentially drawing capital away from more speculative assets like Bitcoin and altcoins. This is the core of the crypto market impact from Fed decisions. The Current Stance: Holding Rates Despite Pressure Despite the pressure from Donald Trump and others who advocate for lower borrowing costs, the Federal Reserve under Jerome Powell has maintained a steady course. Since the start of Trump’s second term (assuming this refers to a hypothetical second term scenario or perhaps reflects a general sentiment during his presidency/post-presidency), the Fed has held rates within a specific range. The snippet mentions 4.25–4.50%, which aligns with rate levels seen in recent years as the Fed has worked to combat inflation that surged after the pandemic. This decision to hold rates reflects the Fed’s assessment of current economic conditions, particularly regarding inflation and employment. They are using data to guide their path, prioritizing price stability even in the face of political commentary or calls for growth stimulation via cheaper money. How Does This Tension Affect the Crypto Market? The dynamic between political pressure and Fed independence creates uncertainty, which the crypto market often reacts to. Here’s how this tension, specifically around Fed interest rates and monetary policy , can influence crypto: Uncertainty Breeds Volatility: Any hint of a shift in Fed policy, whether influenced by politics or data, can lead to significant price swings in crypto. Traders and investors constantly try to anticipate the Fed’s next move. Risk-On vs. Risk-Off Sentiment: If markets perceive that political pressure might lead to lower rates (more stimulative monetary policy ), it can foster a ‘risk-on’ environment where investors are more willing to buy assets like crypto. Conversely, if the Fed remains hawkish (focused on fighting inflation with higher rates), it supports a ‘risk-off’ sentiment, potentially leading to outflows from crypto. Dollar Strength: Higher U.S. interest rates typically strengthen the U.S. dollar, as foreign investors are attracted to higher yields on dollar-denominated assets. A stronger dollar can sometimes correlate with weaker performance in global commodities and potentially alternative assets like crypto, though this relationship is complex and not always direct. Inflation Hedges: Some view Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation. If expansionary monetary policy (like significant rate cuts or money printing) is anticipated, the narrative around Bitcoin as a hedge against currency debasement can gain traction, potentially boosting its price. The fact that Donald Trump is vocal about his preference for lower rates keeps the possibility of political influence on the table, even if Jerome Powell consistently pushes back. This ongoing dialogue contributes to the complex set of factors influencing investor sentiment and, consequently, the crypto market impact . What Are the Challenges and Actionable Insights for Crypto Holders? The primary challenge for crypto investors stemming from this situation is navigating the uncertainty. Predicting the Fed’s exact moves is difficult, and predicting the extent to which political pressure might *eventually* have an effect is even harder. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Pay close attention to official Federal Reserve announcements, meeting minutes, and speeches by Chair Powell and other governors. These provide direct insight into their data-driven approach and future intentions. Monitor Economic Data: Keep an eye on key economic indicators the Fed watches, such as inflation rates (CPI, PCE), employment figures (non-farm payrolls, unemployment rate), and GDP growth. These data points are what truly drive the Fed’s decisions, according to Powell. Understand the Correlation, But Don’t Assume Causation: While there’s a historical correlation between interest rates/monetary policy and crypto market movements, it’s not the only factor. Regulatory news, technological developments, institutional adoption, and global events also play significant roles. Develop a Long-Term Strategy: Relying solely on predicting Fed moves for short-term trading is risky. A well-researched, long-term investment strategy based on the fundamentals of the crypto projects you believe in is often more robust against macro-economic volatility. Consider Diversification: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversifying across different asset classes can help mitigate risks associated with specific market sensitivities, like crypto’s reaction to monetary policy shifts. In Summary: The Ongoing Tug-of-War The meeting between Donald Trump and Jerome Powell serves as a potent reminder of the inherent tension between political goals and the independent mandate of the central bank. While a president may advocate for policies they believe will benefit the economy (like lower Fed interest rates for global competitiveness), the Federal Reserve maintains that its decisions are based on rigorous data analysis aimed at achieving stable prices and maximum employment. This ongoing dialogue, and the market’s reaction to the perceived likelihood of rate changes influenced by either data or pressure, has a tangible crypto market impact . For those invested in digital assets, understanding this complex interplay of monetary policy , political commentary, and economic data is not just academic – it’s a vital part of navigating the market landscape effectively.

2025-05-30T06:40:48.000Z,"FTX Collapse: Netflix Unveils Shocking Series on SBF Scandal","BitcoinWorld FTX Collapse: Netflix Unveils Shocking Series on SBF Scandal Get ready to dive deep into one of the most talked-about events in recent financial history. Netflix, the streaming giant known for bringing complex stories to the screen, is tackling the FTX collapse . That’s right, the dramatic downfall of Sam Bankman-Fried’s cryptocurrency exchange is set to become an eight-part series, promising to peel back the layers on the events that sent shockwaves through the crypto world and beyond. What is the Netflix FTX Series “The Altruists”? According to reports, Netflix is developing an eight-part series focusing on the dramatic implosion of FTX. The working title for the series is reportedly “The Altruists.” This title itself hints at the complex and often contradictory public image cultivated by FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who frequently spoke about effective altruism while allegedly orchestrating massive financial misconduct. The series aims to chronicle the story of FTX, its meteoric rise, and its stunning collapse in November 2022. It will likely place a significant focus on the key figures involved, particularly: Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF): The founder and former CEO of FTX, known for his distinctive look, media presence, and political donations. Caroline Ellison: The former CEO of Alameda Research, FTX’s affiliated trading firm, whose testimony played a crucial role in subsequent legal proceedings. The series is being produced by Higher Ground, the production company founded by former U.S. President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama. This involvement suggests a focus on the broader societal and ethical implications of the collapse, not just the financial details. It indicates the series aims for a wide audience, explaining the complexities of crypto and the scandal in an accessible way. The choice of an eight-part format suggests a comprehensive approach, allowing the series to explore different facets of the story, from the early days of FTX and Alameda to the frantic days leading up to the bankruptcy filing and the aftermath. Deep Dive: The Devastating FTX Collapse The FTX collapse wasn’t just a company going bankrupt; it was a spectacular implosion that wiped out billions in customer funds and severely damaged trust in the cryptocurrency industry. Understanding the context is crucial for appreciating the significance of the Netflix series. FTX, at its peak, was one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, valued at an estimated $32 billion. Sam Bankman-Fried was hailed as a crypto prodigy, a responsible figure bringing legitimacy to the volatile world of digital assets. However, underneath the polished exterior, serious issues were allegedly brewing, primarily involving the relationship between FTX and Alameda Research. Here’s a simplified look at some key aspects the series will likely explore: The Intertwined Relationship: Alameda Research, also founded by SBF, was a hedge fund. Allegations center on Alameda receiving preferential treatment on FTX, including a massive, effectively unlimited line of credit, allowing it to trade with customer funds deposited on the exchange. Misuse of Customer Funds: Prosecutors alleged that billions of dollars in customer funds deposited on FTX were secretly diverted to Alameda to cover its trading losses, make investments, and fund lavish lifestyles and political donations. The Bank Run: The crisis escalated rapidly in early November 2022 following reports raising concerns about Alameda’s balance sheet and its reliance on FTX’s native token, FTT. This triggered a massive wave of customer withdrawals from FTX that the exchange could not fulfill, exposing the lack of reserves. Bankruptcy: Within days, FTX, Alameda, and dozens of affiliated companies filed for bankruptcy in the U.S., leaving millions of customers unable to access their funds. The speed and scale of the collapse were unprecedented for such a major financial institution, leaving regulators, investors, and the public stunned. It highlighted significant risks within the crypto ecosystem, particularly concerning transparency, corporate governance, and the commingling of funds. Key Players: Sam Bankman-Fried and Caroline Ellison At the heart of the FTX scandal are Sam Bankman-Fried and Caroline Ellison. Their relationship, both personal and professional, is central to the narrative. Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF): SBF cultivated an image as a quirky, ethical billionaire, often seen in shorts and a t-shirt, promoting effective altruism and responsible crypto regulation. He testified before Congress and became a prominent voice in the industry. However, prosecutors painted a different picture: that of a calculating individual who defrauded customers and investors on a massive scale. His trial captivated the public, culminating in his conviction on multiple counts of fraud and conspiracy. Caroline Ellison: Ellison was the CEO of Alameda Research. Her role is particularly significant because she was privy to the inner workings of Alameda’s finances and its relationship with FTX. After the collapse, she pleaded guilty to fraud charges and became a key cooperating witness for the government in the case against SBF. Her candid testimony provided crucial insights into the alleged fraudulent activities and the decision-making processes within the two companies. The dynamic between these two figures, their shared history at Jane Street, their cohabitation in the Bahamas, and their differing roles in the alleged scheme, offer fertile ground for dramatic storytelling. The Netflix series will likely explore their motivations, their decisions, and the pressures they faced as their financial empire crumbled. Why a Series on the FTX Scandal Matters Why dedicate an eight-part series to the FTX scandal ? Because it’s more than just a business failure; it’s a story packed with universal themes: Ambition and Hubris: The rapid rise and fall of SBF and FTX exemplify the dangers of unchecked ambition and overconfidence. Ethics and Deception: The core allegations involve a massive betrayal of trust and a stark contrast between public image and private actions. The Complexity of Finance: The series can help demystify some aspects of cryptocurrency and complex financial structures for a general audience, illustrating the risks involved. Regulatory Challenges: The collapse highlighted the urgent need for clearer regulation in the crypto space, a topic of ongoing global debate. Human Impact: Millions of individuals lost significant savings in the collapse. The series has the potential to tell these human stories. For those interested in crypto, finance, or simply compelling narratives of power and downfall, the FTX story is a modern cautionary tale. A high-profile series like this can bring mainstream attention to the risks and complexities of the digital asset world, potentially educating viewers about the importance of due diligence and regulatory oversight. Beyond the Headlines: What Other Crypto Documentaries Should You Watch? While we await the Netflix FTX series , there are other valuable crypto documentaries and series that explore different facets of this fascinating and volatile industry. If you’re hooked on understanding the world of digital assets, consider checking out: Here are a few examples: Title Focus Potential Themes Covered Banking on Bitcoin The origins and early days of Bitcoin and the technology behind it.

With Higher Ground producing, there’s an expectation of a thoughtful and engaging exploration of the events, the individuals involved, and the broader implications. For many, the series will be a chance to understand how such a massive alleged fraud could occur in plain sight. For those affected by the collapse, it might be a difficult but necessary recounting of events. And for the crypto industry, it serves as a stark reminder of the need for transparency, robust regulation, and ethical leadership. As production moves forward, more details about the cast, specific focus areas, and release date will emerge. But one thing is clear: the story of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, and Caroline Ellison is coming to a major streaming platform, ensuring that this pivotal moment in financial history will be examined by a global audience.

Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Selling, New Entrants Still Cautious On-chain analyst Avocado Onchain, writing on CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, examined Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) data to assess investor trends during this stage of the cycle. In a post titled “UTXO Age Band Analysis: Sluggish Inflow of New Investors May Limit Bitcoin’s Upside,” he explored whether BTC’s continued rally can be sustained without fresh capital inflows from newer market participants. His findings suggest that while older coins are being sold, the inflow of newer investors remains low, a factor that has historically limited momentum in previous cycles. The UTXO age distribution reveals that a significant portion of the BTC supply remains with holders who have kept their assets for over six months. The 6–12 month age band has increased, suggesting a large share of market participants still fall into the mid- to long-term holding category. Historically, when the proportion of these holders started to shrink, it often preceded major tops in Bitcoin’s price cycle, driven by a transition of coins from long-term to new investors. However, despite Bitcoin reaching new highs, the percentage of UTXOs held by investors with a holding period of less than one month remains well below the historical threshold seen near previous market tops. During earlier bull cycles, new investor participation often surged past 50%. Currently, that figure sits around 20%, even lower than the peak levels during this recent rally. Avocado Onchain warns that without a notable increase in participation from newer investors, the market may struggle to maintain upward momentum. Large Holders Accumulate as Retail Stays on Sidelines While retail inflows appear to be lacking, large-scale accumulation is continuing in the background. A recent update from CryptoQuant on X highlighted that Bitcoin addresses holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC, excluding exchanges and miners, have been steadily increasing. Large holders are accumulating. Addresses holding 1K–10K BTC (excl. exchanges & miners) are rising, a sign of growing investor confidence. Historically linked to higher prices. pic.twitter.com/vCCml3GfHB — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) May 29, 2025 These entities are often associated with institutional investors or long-term strategic holders, and their accumulation is often interpreted as a signal of growing confidence in BTC’s long-term prospects.

The FTX’s long-awaited creditor repayment program seems to have kept the traders on edge. A $5 billion stablecoin payout could be good news for those who were waiting to recover the funds, but the market could be more focused on where the money could go While the stablecoin flows in and out of the exchange have dropped as the exchange reserves deplete, the top tokens like Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Cardano seem to have been facing some potential selling pressure. Once the recipients receive their portion, the stablecoin reserves on CEX are expected to increase, which could flood the market, increasing the trading activity within the space. Now the question arises, will Bitcoin or Ethereum benefit from this move? After marking new highs during the past week, the Bitcoin price has initiated the weekly trade on a bearish note. The token is on the verge of losing below the pivotal support zone, while Ethereum displays strength as it sustains firmly above $2600, maintaining consecutive higher highs and lows. Besides, XRP & ADA continue to trade below the descending trend line, while memecoins are plunging with a double-digit margin. The payout is one of the largest in crypto history, as the creditors are set to receive funds after 18 months of the exchange’s collapse. Hence, this is expected to hit the exchanges first, which could increase the stablecoin exchange reserve. While some may exit the space, some are believed to get swapped for the other cryptos, Bitcoin being one of the popular choices. Hence, Bitcoin is expected to receive some liquidity that may push the price slightly higher. With this, the other cryptos could also experience a similar price rise that could help the markets remain under bullish influence.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/massive-liquidity-set-to-enter-crypto-markets-for-the-first-time-ever-will-this-benefit-bitcoins-price/,"BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-05-30T06:04:49.000Z,"Crypto Holders Sit in Massive Gains as Percent of Supply in Profit Soars","An on-chain indicator is clearly showing the current sentiment for the major cryptos : most holders are sitting on unrealized profits. The “Percent of Total Supply in Profit” metric tracks how much of a cryptocurrency’s circulating supply was acquired at a price lower than its current market value. Right now, it seems that a lot of top coins are seeing a historically high amount of profit among their holders. Here are the figures for some of the major coins: Bitcoin (BTC): 73.1% Ethereum (ETH): 79.6% Litecoin (LTC): 83.5% Chainlink (LINK): 92.3% Ripple (XRP): 90.5% Polkadot (DOT): 91.5% Cardano (ADA): 87.9% Solana (SOL): 95.4% The figures for Chainlink, Ripple and Solana are especially impressive. The data indicates that the market has experienced widespread increases in the prices of assets, from Bitcoin and Ethereum to altcoins like XRP and Dogecoin. This could be seen as a sign that the market is quite strong. But it could also mean that the market in general is due for a correction, as people might be tempted to take profits after the long, nearly uninterrupted upward trend we’ve seen. Bitcoin, XRP Lead the Pack in Holder Profits New data shows that Bitcoin has the highest amount of its supply in profit. Currently, 98.4% of circulating Bitcoin is worth more than it was worth when it was acquired. This reflects the long-term bullishness of Bitcoin. It also reflects the conviction held by many who hold Bitcoin. XRP is closely behind with 98.3 percent of its supply in favorable territory for holders. This is a surprising figure given all the regulatory and legal trouble XRP has faced, including a lawsuit from the SEC. XRP is now almost completely in profitable territory thanks to its recent price recovery. Pretty much all XRP holders are now making money, which confirms that the market has pretty much shaken off the earlier uncertainty it had with regard to this token. Other significant assets are likewise registering stout profit rates. Chainlink counts 80.5 percent of its supply in profit; Dogecoin, 77.9 percent; Ethereum, 71.5 percent; and Cardano, 71.0 percent. Not on par with Bitcoin or XRP, these numbers nonetheless suggest a large swath of token holders in these networks is seeing returns on its investments. Percent of Total Supply in Profit is a straightforward metric that shows how much of a cryptocurrency’s current circulating supply is held at a profit—meaning the coins were bought at a lower price than they’re worth today. Currently, some notable top caps' supply in profit… pic.twitter.com/QU3sGrtV07 — Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 28, 2025 What This Metric Tells Us About Market Sentiment The Percent of Supply in Profit is a metric that is simple and direct. A token is either in profit or it isn’t, with the profit margin being minimal for some. This offers a simple yet effective way of viewing how positioned in the market investors are. Of course, when large amounts of a coin’s supply are in profit, it more often than not indicates that the price has been moving in a positive direction recently and that the holders themselves are exhibiting bullish sentiment. Yet this trend can also signal something more ominous. When a token becomes overbought—as indicated by the variety of signals described above—its price is probably at or near an unsustainable peak. Although this peak may persist for a time, it will inevitably be followed by a cooldown phase. Since this is the typical life cycle of overbought tokens, these sorts of price trends represent the kind of living danger signs that traders should be wary of. Conversely, when most of a coin’s supply is losing money, this usually signals that the market is awash with pessimism and fear. Historically, these moments of low sentiment have often coincided with buying opportunities. They tend to mark the moments when a coin is way undervalued and is just about to recover in price. To gain a better overall understanding, this metric is frequently examined together with other ones such as the Market Value to Realized Value ratio (MVRV), the Relative Strength Index (RSI), and the Network Realized Profit/Loss. When looked at together, they offer insight into whether or not the market is in an overbought or oversold condition, or somewhere in the middle. Rising Profits: Opportunity or Warning? With the continual evolution of cryptocurrencies and the emergence of new coins, it’s anticipated that an increasing portion of the supply of individual assets will be held in profit. But looking at percentages instead of actual numbers gives us a clearer, inflation-adjusted picture of the current market. This allows us to reach conclusions that aren’t misled by simple volume comparisons. At present, the profits being made by the holders of Bitcoin, XRP, and other major coins are nearly universal. That is an unambiguous thumbs-up for the kind of upward momentum we like to see. And yet, it also makes us think about being cautious. At least, it should make us think about being cautious because crypto’s cyclical nature means that periods of high profitability often lead to market resets—consolidations or corrections. The percentage of supply in profit isn’t predictive by itself, but combined with larger market analysis, it becomes a pretty nifty gauge of investor sentiment. Whether this current round of nice moves turns out to be the prelude to sustained new highs or just the thing that kicks off the next wave of profit-taking, the fact is that right now the entire crypto market is in a nice phase, and everyone is watching to see what happens next.

This ascent represents a rise of $25.8 billion from the recent lows and highlights a developing demand among traders and investors for the more refined vehicles that serve to hedge risk and implement relatively advanced trading strategies. The open interest in options has been increasing much more rapidly than that in futures, a sign of the evolving nature of the Bitcoin derivatives market. $BTC options open interest recently hit an all-time high of $46.2B – up +$25.8B from the lows. This sharp growth outpaces futures and signals rising demand for more advanced hedging and strategy execution as market participants grow more sophisticated. pic.twitter.com/YXp24CRVfC — glassnode (@glassnode) May 29, 2025 A broader shift in how market participants approach Bitcoin is clearly reflected in the rising interest in options. Instead of exclusively buying and holding, or trading in the spot market, more and more investors are turning to Bitcoin options to manage risk, make speculative bets on price movements, and set up intricate (and sometimes not-so-intricate) derivatives trades. This signals, if nothing else, that the Bitcoin ecosystem is maturing, and options are a part of that maturation. Short-Term Holder Profitability Shows Healthy Market Dynamics In tandem with the thriving options market, on-chain metrics offer intriguing glimpses into the actions and gains of short-term Bitcoin holders. The Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (STH SOPR), taken as a 30-day moving average, recently reached a local high. This metric can be understood as tracking the average profit or loss realized by investors who have held (and then spent or sold) their Bitcoin for a short duration (less than a now-treasured four-year hold period). The STH SOPR (30DMA) metric, which measures the average profit or loss realized by short-term investors when spending coins on-chain, recently hit a local high STH realized profit rose noticeably. Nevertheless, demand for coins remains strong enough not to hinder the bullish… pic.twitter.com/dsE8toaEin — Axel Adler Jr (@AxelAdlerJr) May 29, 2025 The increase in STH realized profits indicates that short-term holders more frequently are capturing gains, and this reflects an environment where buying opportunities exist, and traders are effectively timing their exits. It is vital to note, however, that despite this uptick, the STH SOPR has not yet hit the euphoric levels we witnessed during previous Bitcoin price tops. This indicates that while profits are being taken, the market is not yet overheated or showing signs of excessive exuberance. A positive feedback loop is sustained by the short-term investors’ steady profitability: Profits can be reinvested and used to support trading activity, which keeps the liquidity flowing and the prices moving in the right (upward) direction. The SOPR indicator is a pretty reliable way of gauging the presence or absence of euphoric speculative bubbles in a market. And right now, it is not showing any signs of those kinds of bubbles being present. Bitcoin Spot ETFs Attract Steady Capital Inflows In addition to the burgeoning activity in derivatives markets and on-chain metrics, there is now clear evidence that investor demand for Bitcoin spot ETFs is also growing rapidly. On May 28, for instance, Bitcoin spot ETFs saw net inflows of $433 million. This follows nine straight days of inflows into these regulated investment products. Compared to other vehicles of exposure to Bitcoin, the appetite for ETFs not only continues to but also appears to be speeding up. Spot ETF inflows into Bitcoin are now comparable with inflows into gold ETFs by this point in their adoption. On May 28, Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded a net inflow of $433 million, marking 10 consecutive days of net inflows. Ethereum spot ETFs saw a net inflow of $84.89 million, extending their streak to 8 consecutive days. https://t.co/ueXcZjub6m — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 29, 2025 Funds holding Bitcoin are now under the same regulatory regime as funds that hold gold, and that’s a big deal. Trust and acceptance as an asset class are now coming at us like the floodgates have opened, and the ETF is the vehicle of choice across our bridge to traditional finance. These inflows also reinforce the bullish trend in Bitcoin’s price. Increased demand from ETFs can translate into upward price pressure. Inflows occurring over several days also say something about investor confidence. They say that confidence is strong and that market participants see value in maintaining or increasing their Bitcoin exposure. A Growing Ecosystem of Sophistication and Confidence When we look at all these data points together, they show us a very clear picture: The Bitcoin market is moving into the next stage of its maturity. This next stage is marked by not just the appearance but also the substance of increased player sophistication; as for profitability, the short-term holders of Bitcoin (i.e., the folks who buy and sell it under the one-year window of the capital gains tax) are sitting on plenty of it, with the STH SOPR being a very nice leading indicator of that realm. And as for price discovery, things are looking really good. At the same time, uninterrupted net inflows into spot ETFs highlight growing institutional confidence and adoption. They further reinforce the narrative that Bitcoin is moving, in a very controlled way, toward the kind of mainstream acceptance that assets like gold enjoy. Bitcoin is always developing, and these trends point out how critical it is to keep an eye on derivatives activity, on-chain metrics, and capital flows if you want to understand the market’s underlying strength and direction. For investors and spectators, the expanding toolkit of financial instruments and the plethora of positive market signals make for a pretty good reason to be cautiously optimistic about Bitcoin’s next growth and adoption phases.

2025-05-30T05:49:24.000Z,"Bitcoin and Ethereum Spot ETFs Continue to Attract Strong Investor Interest","May 28 represented another big day for crypto-investment products, which saw substantial net inflows for Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs. Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded an incredible net inflow of $433 million. That inflow extends the run of consecutive daily inflows to spot Bitcoin ETFs to an impressive ten days. Meanwhile, Ethereum spot ETFs maintained their own strong momentum, too, registering a net inflow of $84.89 million. Ethereum spot ETFs have now seen their own consecutive daily inflow run extended to an impressive eight days. The inflows into these ETFs reflect a developing institutional inclination toward digital assets and a newly discovered adoption of cryptocurrency investment vehicles that combine traditional finance with the nascent blockchain ecosystem. Spot ETFs are increasingly being viewed by market participants as accessible and regulatory-compliant ways of achieving exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum while avoiding the direct custody of assets. Bitcoin Spot ETFs See Ten Straight Days of Net Inflows Over the last ten days, capital has accumulated in Bitcoin’s spot ETFs with stunning consistency. On just May 28 alone, they attracted a net inflow of $433 million. That’s a clarion call from both institutional and retail investors, and it’s one of the main reasons I think the SEC may be close to approving a Bitcoin spot ETF. On May 28, Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded a net inflow of $433 million, marking 10 consecutive days of net inflows. Ethereum spot ETFs saw a net inflow of $84.89 million, extending their streak to 8 consecutive days. https://t.co/ueXcZjub6m — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 29, 2025 In the previous three months, we have seen inflows of Bitcoin. These inflows have continued and actually even picked up pace in the last month. The latest data we have indicates that in August, we saw capital inflows, net capital inflows into Bitcoin, to the tune of $107 million. Spot ETFs serve as a vital link between traditional investment structures and the world of cryptocurrencies. They present an investment vehicle that is both familiar and regulated, thus reducing the entry barriers for many investors who might prefer to stay on this side of the bridge. And the bridge has been holding up well, with strong inflows into Bitcoin spot ETFs over the past few months. Ethereum Spot ETFs Extend Their Winning Streak Ethereum spot ETFs have similarly enjoyed a sustained wave of capital inflows. On May 28, right around the time of the latest annual Divergence Strategic Summit, Ethereum contents of spot ETFs received capital inflows of $84.89 million. This extended the streak of daily gains for Ethereum-backed ETFs to eight consecutive days. The primary programmable blockchain, Ethereum continues to draw institutional investor interest as a result of forthcoming improvements in scalability and network performance. The current inflow of exchange-traded-fund capital suggests that investors believe Ethereum’s ecosystem is developing favorably and that they will secure some appreciable delta by holding that which is most likely to be a more valuable token in the years to come. ETH ICO Whale on the Move Again: Another Sell-Off Begins The legendary “1 Million #ETH ICO Whale” has resumed selling — and the numbers are massive. Just 8 hours ago, this wallet recharged 956.7 ETH (worth $2.53M) to #OKX , raising fresh sell-off alarms. Details: pic.twitter.com/y03d4FL9dL — EyeOnChain (@EyeOnChain) May 29, 2025 Capital has been coming into Ethereum ETFs steadily, which fits into a broader market trend we see. And this trend is that investors are looking to get diversified exposure to major blockchain networks beyond just Bitcoin. The way I see it, and I think a lot of people in our industry see it, this is a trend reflecting confidence in Ethereum. And their confidence isn’t unfounded. A lot of things are happening on Ethereum, to Ethereum, and with Ethereum. Whale Activity Sheds Light on Ethereum Market Dynamics While institutional investments in Ethereum ETFs appear to show an accelerating interest in the markets, it is the notable individual investment activity that provides a wealth of further insight. One of the most prominent Ethereum whales, operating from wallet 0xC8d6C156c13AC68ADA3f03B80fc201ae4867A57d, continues to make waves. This investor holds some 51,663 ETH, or $140 million worth of the digital asset, at very low basis costs: about $0.31 per ETH. Interestingly, this whale has just received an additional 24,000 ETH three days ago, which is quite the addition to their already hefty pile of ETH. Despite that, it’s good to note that this whale was just gifted 24,000 ETH three days ago. Investor actions on such a large scale send very valuable signals to the market. When savvy traders who are long-term holders of an asset accumulate it, that tends to signal to us that they are quite confident in the asset’s future trajectory. And such accumulation seems to be happening now in the Bitcoin market. This is—again—adding to the support of the price increases we are seeing. A Growing Narrative of Institutional Adoption Continued inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs and strategic activity by large holders are evidence of a maturing cryptocurrency market. Institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals see these assets as central to their portfolios, now that regulated products allow for a more straightforward and secure investment process. While the crypto ecosystem is still in its infancy, ETFs will likely help it evolve. They will help the whole ecosystem maintain compliance with financial regulations while enabling a much broader base of participation. They will also make Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other tokens (or at least those that have passed muster) much more accessible on a risk-adjusted basis to a much wider variety of investors. Not too bad for something that wasn’t even on the horizon a year or so ago. For investors and observers, the steady influx of capital and strategic accumulation make clear that there is a consensus forming around the idea that digital assets are here to stay—not that they are merely ephemeral, like a fad, but that they are something much more fundamental, like a building block of the future financial system.

We still have that in our books.” JUST IN: European soccer giant Paris Saint Germain announces they adopted a #Bitcoin treasury reserve pic.twitter.com/nGeq7bUyBJ — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) May 29, 2025 The team is facing off in the Champions League soccer finals next week in Munich. PSG is currently the champion of the French domestic Ligue 1. Football Remains Most Popular Sport for Crypto A recent study by Sport Quake said that football made up 43% of all crypto and digital asset sponsorship for the 2024/25 season. This has resulted in a 64% year-over-year increase in the total amount of sponsorships. “All the growth is from football (soccer) and non-US spend as brands invest in global sponsorships and international markets while they wait to see President Trump’s US crypto policies,” said Matt House, CEO of SportQuake. Further, 44% of all crypto football sponsorships happen within Europe’s top five leagues, including France’s Ligue 1. PSG’s decision to venture into crypto accumulation follows a growing trend among corporations to include Bitcoin in their balance sheets. Corporate Adoption of Bitcoin, Crypto is Accelerating Bitcoin has become a treasury preference for more companies and brands, following President Donald Trump’s strategic Bitcoin reserve order, which helped clear the path. Dom Harz, Co-Founder of BOB (Build on Bitcoin), told Cryptonews that “ETFs have a lot to do with” the adoption. “The most interesting change we’ve seen over the last two years is the mood shift between Bitcoin once being a speculative bet and now being a strategic play for corporations,” he said via email. “From a corporate point of view, there is massive appeal. They would have a passive yield on their assets, and it offers them diversity from traditional investments.” The post Football Team Paris Saint-Germain Scores Bitcoin Treasury Strategy appeared first on Cryptonews .",cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/football-team-paris-saint-germain-scores-bitcoin-treasury-strategy/,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION","Bitcoin News|Bitcoin|Bitcoin Reserve",cryptocompare

2025-05-30T05:29:38.000Z,"Pi Network Price Prediction for June 2025","The post Pi Network Price Prediction for June 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Pi Network made an impressive start this month, but it was short-lived. The token has dropped over 75% from its February high near $3 and is currently sitting at $0.6894, down 6% in the last 24 hours and 15% over the week. Pi Coin Stuck In Tight Range With Bearish Trends Pi is currently stuck in a tight range between $0.688 and $0.816, and is hovering above key support levels. Despite the price dip, trading volume is up 42% in the past day to $158 million. But on-chain data reveals rising exchange inflows, a sign that more Pi is being prepared for selling as 263 million Pi coins will be unlocked in June, 233 million in July, and 132 million in August. The coin’s trend remains bearish with all key moving averages (10, 20, 50, 100-day EMAs and SMAs) sitting above the current price. The Bollinger Bands are tightening, and the MACD is negative. RSI is also neutral at 43.6. Unless the Pi breaks above the $0.75-$0.78 resistance range, the next key support levels are $0.60 and $0.50. If the buying volume picks up, it could retest the $0.85-$0.85 zone. However, on the flip side, it could stay stuck between $0.70 and $0.76 through May 31. Will Pi Rebound Above $1? As the first half of the year comes to a close, Pi could face more selling pressure if fear and doubt grip the market. This could push the price to $0.58-$0.65 in the short term. According to CoinDCX , if the buyer interest returns and volume picks up, it has a chance to rebound toward the $1.00-$1.20 level. If there is momentum, it could even finish June at $1.82 . The price of Pi will likely continue to decline until the end of August, after which it may slowly start to recover. I previously predicted it could drop to $0.40—unless the Pi Core Team becomes transparent. No investor wants to put money into something where the founders refuse… pic.twitter.com/KEvAwOyhX9 — Dr Altcoin (@Dr_Picoin) May 28, 2025 However, analyst Dr Altcoin predicts that Pi’s price may keep falling through August, after which it may slowly start to recover. He had previously warned that it could drop to $0.40, unless the Pi Core Team steps up with more transparency. In the long term, Pi network is pushing to build value through its $100M Ventures Fund aimed at real-world use cases in fintech, gaming, e-commerce, and AI. But for now, the technical picture stays weak until demand picks up. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Adams, however, is pushing for more flexible policies to support crypto adoption. To make this happen, he’s set up a Crypto Council to guide digital asset strategies and position NYC as a global hub for crypto innovation. On the national front, crypto momentum is building. President Donald Trump’s recent executive order established a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, acquiring about 200,000 BTC to promote government-driven Bitcoin adoption.

2025-05-30T05:12:06.000Z,"Krypto Reserve: Laut David Sacks könnten nun doch aktive Zukäufe möglich sein – wie hoch könnte dann der Preis des Bitcoin klettern?","Im Zuge des US Präsidentschaftswahlkampfs hat sich Donald Trump ganz klar auf die Seite der Krypto-Befürworter gestellt. Schnell kam er mit der Idee der Bitcoin Reserve – man wolle zudem die USA zur Hauptstadt des Bitcoin machen. Als dann die ersten Details zur geplanten Reserve nach seiner Wahl präsentiert wurden, war die Krypto-Branche aber sichtlich enttäuscht: Trump hat einen Plan präsentiert, der nicht ganz so klang, wie das noch im Wahlkampf posaunt wurde. Trumps erster Plan zur Bitcoin Reserve Als Donald Trump am 6. März die U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve per Dekret angeordnet hat, wurde auf den Weg gegeben, dass nur die von den US Behörden konfiszierten Coins aus Straf- oder Zivilverfahren veranlagt werden sollen. Trump betonte, ein aktives Zukaufen werde es nicht geben, weil man die Amerikaner nicht belasten wolle. Wenn man Bitcoin kaufen will, dann nur haushaltsneutral, also ohne die Staatsbürger zu belasten. Im Rahmen der aktuellen Bitcoin Konferenz in Las Vegas gab es nun erste Details, dass dieser Plan nun doch in eine andere Richtung gehen könnte. So wurden Finanzminister Scott Bessent und Handelsminister Howard Lutnick bereits von Trump persönlich informiert, man solle haushaltsneutrale Strategien schaffen, damit Bitcoins zugekauft werden können. Auch David Sacks, der Krypto-Berater von Trump, gab bekannt, dass es nun zu Änderungen bei der Bitcoin Reserve kommen könnte: „Die Executive Order zur Einrichtung der strategischen Bitcoin Reserve erlaubt es der Regierung, mehr zu kaufen, wenn dies haushaltsneutral geschehen kann. Konkret: Wenn wir Howard Lutnik oder Scott Bessent davon überzeugen können, welche zu kaufen, und sie herausfinden können, wie sie es finanzieren, ohne eine neue Steuer oder ohne die Schulden zu erhöhen, dann könnten wir potenziell mehr Bitcoin erwerben.” Von wo will die USA das Geld für Zukäufe bekommen? Welche Möglichkeiten könnte es geben, dass die USA nun aktiv Bitcoin kauft, ohne das Budget zu belasten? Finanzierungsquellen könnten unter anderem überschüssige Gelder aus anderen Regierungsprogrammen sein. Die Analysten der Research Firma K33 haben bereits schon Vorschläge geäußert, welche haushaltsneutrale Strategien möglich seien, um Bitcoins kaufen zu können: Man könnte beispielsweise Sonderziehungsrechten des IWF verkaufen oder mit Überschüssen aus dem Stabilisierungsfonds, der vom Finanzministerium verwaltet wird, Bitcoin kaufen. Auf diesen Wegen könnte man frisches Geld bekommen, ohne dass die Amerikaner belastet würden. „Ich kann nichts versprechen, aber es gibt einen Weg, das zu tun“, so David Sacks. „Die Frage ist nur, können wir entweder das Finanzministerium oder das Handelsministerium dafür begeistern? Denn wenn sie das tun und herausfinden können, wie sie es finanzieren, haben sie tatsächlich die präsidentielle Genehmigung bereits in der Tasche.“ Die Homepage von Bitcoin Bull aufrufen Bitcoin Bull würde ebenfalls von aktiven Zukäufen in die Bitcoin Reserve profitieren Die neuen Pläne, dass man nun eine haushaltsneutrale Stragie erstellen wolle, um Bitcoins zukaufen zu können, freut einerseits jene, die in Bitcoin investiert haben, andererseits auch die Fans von Bitcon Bull, die bereits BTCBULL Token gekauft haben. Denn aktive Zukäufe werden wohl den Preis der Kryptowährung nach oben treiben – hier profitieren jene, die Bitcoin und BTCBULL haben. Bei Bitcoin Bull handelt es sich um ein Projekt im Initial Coin Offering, das sich in erster Linie an der Kryptowährung Bitcoin orientiert. Springt der Preis des Bitcoin auf 125.000 US Dollar, findet der erste Token Burn statt. Durch die Verknappung des Gesamtangebots kann eine Preissteigerung möglich sein, vor allem, wenn die Nachfrage bleibt oder höher wird. Bei 150.000 US Dollar gibt es dann die erste Belohnung für die BTCBULL Investoren. Abhängig von der Menge an BTCBULL Token, die gehalten werden, fällt die Höhe der Belohnung aus. Überspringt der Bitcoin die 175.000 US Dollar, dann folgt der nächste Token Burn, beim Überspringen der 200.000 US Dollar die nächste Belohnung. Überspringt der Bitcoin dann die 225.000 US Dollar-Hürde, gibt es den letzten Token Burn und beim Erreichen der 250.000 US Dollar die letzte Belohnung. Derzeit gibt es BTCBULL Token nur über die Plattform selbst. Erst nach dem Ende des Presales kann BTCBULL auch über offizielle Kryptobörsen gekauft werden.

2025-05-30T05:11:15.000Z,"How James Wynn Lost $60 Million in a Week Trading Bitcoin","The post How James Wynn Lost $60 Million in a Week Trading Bitcoin appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In the world of cryptocurrency trading, fortunes can be made — and lost — in a matter of days. One such example is James Wynn , a crypto trader famous for using high leverage in his trades. Recently, Wynn faced one of the biggest losses of his career, losing over $60 million in just seven days. What Happened? The trouble began on May 19th, when Wynn opened a big trade on Bitcoin using 40x leverage. This means for every $1 of his own money, he borrowed $40 to increase his bet. He started with 5,520 Bitcoin at a price of around $103,300. Over the next few days, he kept increasing his position, pushing it past 9,300 Bitcoin and then above the $1 billion mark. At first, it looked like a smart move. As Bitcoin’s price rose, Wynn’s trade showed unrealized profits of over $10 million. He even locked in some gains by closing part of his position. But the market soon turned against him. A drop in Bitcoin’s price, triggered by news about new U.S. tariffs on European goods, caused his position to lose value fast. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Is Crypto Going Down Today? , Wynn tried to recover by adding new trades and switching strategies, but the losses kept piling up. By May 26th, he had lost about $60 million, making it one of the steepest declines of his career. Despite the setback, he mentioned that his trading account still had around $25 million in profits from earlier trades. Who Is James Wynn? James Wynn became famous in the crypto world during the 2022 bull market. Back then, he reportedly got support from Alameda Research, a trading firm known for backing new crypto traders. Wynn gained attention for his aggressive trading style, using leverage levels as high as 40x to amplify his positions . He made big profits trading Bitcoin and meme coins like Pepe Coin and Official Trump Token . His strategy involves reacting quickly to market moves and even using social media to share his positions, which sometimes influences other traders. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-30T05:00:21.000Z,"Bitcoin Selling Pressure Weak As Binance Inflows Stay Subdued – Can BTC Sustain Its Rally?","Bitcoin (BTC) continues to trade close to its new all-time high (ATH) of $111,980, set earlier this week. While some argue that the top digital asset may be running out of steam, Binance exchange flow data suggests that certain investor groups are reluctant to sell their BTC just yet, expecting further upside. Bitcoin Inflows To Binance Suggest Further Upside Possible According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by on-chain analyst Darkfost, analyzing BTC inflows to Binance from both short-term holders (STHs) and long-term holders (LTHs) can offer meaningful insights into selling pressure and its potential impact on price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Eyeing $112,000 After Bullish Double Bottom Breakout, Analyst Says Darkfost noted that STHs tend to be the most reactive and emotionally driven investor group when it comes to market movements. The analyst shared several examples from past market cycles. For instance, during the price correction in August 2024 when BTC dropped from around $69,000 to $53,000, the STH cohort sent more than 12,000 BTC to Binance. Similarly, the group offloaded over 14,000 BTC onto Binance during the tariff-induced panic in early March 2025. However, current behavior differs. Amid the ongoing rally, selling pressure from STHs remains “very moderate,” with only 8,000 BTC sent to Binance so far. LTHs are exhibiting a similar trend. At the 2024 market peak, LTHs deposited 626 BTC to Binance, and 254 BTC before the previous top. In contrast, just 86 BTC have been deposited by LTHs during this current rally. The analyst concluded: Whether we’re talking about STH or LTH, inflows to Binance are not concerning at the moment. However, this should still be considered in the context of current demand, which remains relatively strong for now. Although the demand for BTC remains healthy as of now, some warning signs are starting to emerge. In an X post, noted crypto analyst Ali Martinez offered commentary on Bitcoin’s current range-bound price action, warning that if it drops below the $106,800 support level, a sharp breakdown may follow. No Panic Selling Observed Yet Historically, when BTC hits or approaches a new ATH, it tends to trigger a wave of profit-taking, leading to substantial selling pressure. However, this has not been observed during the current cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rebound Signals Healthier Bull Market Without Overheating, Analyst Says Recent analysis shows that both STH and LTH cohorts are sitting on elevated unrealized profits, yet there are no strong signs of selling. Additionally, exchange withdrawals are on the rise, suggesting that investors may be anticipating further price appreciation. Another bullish indicator is the relatively low level of retail participation in this rally – often a sign that the market hasn’t yet reached euphoric conditions. At press time, BTC trades at $10,503, down 0.3% in the past 24 hours.

This week’s event is larger than usual as it’s the end of the month, which could induce more volatility into markets that have been in retreat for the past several days. Crypto Options Expiry This week’s batch of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 0.87, meaning that there are slightly more long contracts expiring than shorts as sentiment cools. There is also a max pain point of $100,000, around $6,000 below current spot prices, which is where most losses will be made on contract expiry. Open interest (OI), or the value or number of BTC options contracts yet to expire, is highest at the $120,000 strike price, which has $1.7 billion, and there is an additional $1.6 billion in OI at the $110,000 strike price as bullish speculators remain confident, according to Deribit. Options Expiry Alert At 08:00 UTC tomorrow, over $11.7B in crypto options are set to expire on Deribit. $BTC : $10.03B notional | Put/Call: 0.87 | Max Pain: $100K $ETH : $1.67B notional | Put/Call: 0.83 | Max Pain: $2,300 Calls dominate OI at higher strikes, reflecting… pic.twitter.com/VlISVbmL8t — Deribit (@DeribitOfficial) May 29, 2025 In a recent update on May 30, crypto derivatives provider Greeks Live said, “The market is still more optimistic about BTC breaking out to new highs in the near future.” It added that the put/call ratio for delivery is falling, and “above $100,000, this price has lasted for the entire first half of the year.” “Crypto institutions are not showing much reaction to the new highs in the pie, with low expectations for a near-term surge, and more expectations for a steady, moderate rise.” In addition to today’s batch of Bitcoin options, there are around 624,000 Ethereum contracts that are also expiring today, with a notional value of $1.62 billion, a max pain point of $2,300, and a put/call ratio of 0.81. This brings Friday’s combined crypto options expiry notional value to around $11.5 billion “The upward shock of the ETH [move] has begun to slow down, and the market has recalibrated the price of the ETH and volatility, which has risen slightly overall,” Greeks commented. Crypto Market Outlook The crypto market decline has accelerated over the past 24 hours, with total capitalization dumping 4.4% to $3.46 trillion. Bitcoin is leading losses, with the asset dropping below $106,000 during the Friday morning Asian trading session in a 2% daily dive. Ethereum’s momentum is waning as ETH dumped 5% on the day, dipping below $2,600 on Friday morning. As usual, the altcoins are a sea of red with larger losses for Solana, Dogecoin, Cardano, Hyperliquid, Chainlink, and Avalanche.

2025-05-30T04:38:44.000Z,"PSG becomes the first football club to adopt Bitcoin treasury reserve","Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) has become the first professional football club to adopt Bitcoin (BTC) as part of its treasury reserve strategy. The French football giant shared the news at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, revealing that it had converted a portion of its cash reserves into Bitcoin last year—a position it continues to hold on its balance sheet. PSG adds Bitcoin to its treasury and follows what big companies are doing PSG Labs lead Pär Helgosson made the official announcement during the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. Helgosson told the crowd, “We put Bitcoin in our books, and we still have it.” PSG invested in its Bitcoin reserves at a time when large publicly traded firms like MicroStrategy, GameStop, Trump Media, and Twenty-One Capital were adding large amounts of Bitcoin to their corporate treasuries to protect against inflation. Most sports clubs launched fan tokens or NFTs to engage with fans and generate quick revenue through digital collectibles during the last crypto bull run in the pandemic years. Platforms like Chiliz and Socios helped them reach the right audience. However, those were one-off experiments that ended with the pandemic, and PSG wants to change how the club manages its financial foundation. PSG is now the first football club in the world to publicly say it holds Bitcoin as part of its official financial reserve. This puts it in the same category as tech companies and financial institutions that believe Bitcoin is a long-term store of value worth holding. The club also proves that Bitcoin is not just a tool for tech firms or hedge funds but also a real financial asset that global lifestyle brands like sports clubs can use. PSG uses Bitcoin to connect with young fans and support new tech ideas Most PSG supporters have grown up in the digital age—familiar with smartphones, social media, and online payments—and many now recognize or use Bitcoin. With over 550 million fans worldwide, 80% of whom are under 34, the club adopted a Bitcoin treasury to resonate with its younger audience. For this generation, Bitcoin represents freedom, decentralization, and the future of global finance . The club aims to be recognized as a winning football team on the field and as a forward-thinking brand. It wants to connect with its young, global fanbase—millions of supporters across Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Americas who increasingly see digital money as part of everyday life. PSG now refers to itself as a lifestyle brand because Pär Helgosson said the club wants to keep up with the times and change how sports organizations work with digital technology. PSG Labs launched in 2023 and is the club’s special unit that explores, tests and develops innovations in blockchain, virtual reality, tokenized fan experiences, and digital assets like NFTs and Bitcoin. Helgosson said the PSG invested in its Bitcoin reserves to support a long-term vision where Bitcoin becomes part of the club’s digital and financial identity. PSG also plans to invest in early-stage crypto startups and mentor Bitcoin entrepreneurs. The club aims to leverage its influence and brand power to help builders bring their projects to market, reach global audiences, and raise funding with the club’s backing. Helgosson commented at the conference, saying, “We will launch with you, list with you, raise with you.” PSG has a unique platform that can help Bitcoin founders and developers find customers, reach new users, and get the kind of visibility that is usually difficult to achieve in the crowded world of startups. The club has over half a billion fans and a brand that works with global sponsors, streaming platforms, and major athletes to make this possible. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-05-30T03:30:02.000Z,"Bitcoin Rally Stalls at $108K as Key Risk Metric Flashes Red, Is Correction Looming?","Bitcoin (BTC) has recently experienced a slight slowdown after its impressive upward run, trading at $108,012 at the time of writing. Over the past week, Bitcoin has recorded a 3.1% decline, indicating a moderate pullback from recent highs. However, despite this short-term downtrend, the asset continues to hold steady above significant support levels, suggesting minimal selling pressure from market participants. Amid the current pullback phase, analysts have started to express caution regarding Bitcoin’s immediate outlook. In particular, one CryptoQuant analyst known by the handle Crazzyblockk highlighted the emergence of an elevated market risk signal through the “Standardized 60-Day Realized Cap Volatility (RCV)” metric. This indicator, frequently monitored by investors to assess risk levels, has reportedly crossed a critical historical threshold. Related Reading: Bitcoin $106,800 Support Retest To Determine Next Move – Breakout Or Breakdown Ahead? Understanding the Elevated Risk Signal The 60-Day Standardized RCV, as explained by Crazzyblockk, measures the variance between Bitcoin’s realized capitalization, essentially the cumulative value at which all coins last moved, and its market capitalization. This metric is normalized to account for volatility, thus helping investors detect significant shifts in market sentiment. Currently, the Standardized RCV value has reached 1.9, surpassing the 1.5 threshold traditionally viewed as indicative of high market risk. Historically, when the 60-Day Standardized RCV exceeds values between 1.5 and 1.9, it has often preceded local market peaks or considerable corrections. According to the analyst, these elevated readings indicate periods when investor behavior, characterized by increased profit-taking and speculative activities, diverges notably from Bitcoin’s fundamental valuation. Implications for Bitcoin Investors The current Standardized RCV reading suggests that Bitcoin’s market might be approaching a point of heightened caution. Although this indicator alone is not a definitive sell signal, it does suggest investors should adopt a more conservative risk management approach, especially in regard to new positions or leveraged trades. This cautious stance aligns with historical data from other widely monitored metrics like the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio and the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), both of which currently reflect similarly heightened risk levels. For investors, the present scenario necessitates careful consideration of market conditions before making strategic moves. The Standardized RCV indicator serves as a precise gauge to navigate market volatility, advising investors to consider reducing exposure, tightening stop-losses, or potentially waiting for a clearer alignment of price with underlying fundamentals before making substantial commitments. Crazzyblockk noted: Now is a time for risk management, not euphoria. Investors may consider reducing exposure, tightening stops, or awaiting a retest of fundamentals before re-entry. Standardized RCV continues to be a precision tool in navigating crypto volatility.

2025-05-30T03:24:48.000Z,"Crypto Staking Doesn't Violate U.S. Securities Law, SEC Says","Crypto staking, under certain circumstances, does not appear to implicate U.S. securities law, a branch of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said late Thursday. The SEC's Division of Corporation Finance published a staff statement — the latest in a series from the regulator — spelling out how the regulator may evaluate proof-of-stake networks, mainly noting that covered activities do not \""involve the offer and sale of securities\"" — meaning the SEC won't sue any person or company participating in those activities. Node operators and validators, custodians, delegates, nominators and entities staking assets either on their own, staking directly with a third party or staking on behalf of an asset's owners fall into this bucket, the staff statement said. In this, the SEC seems to suggest that staking will be treated identically to mining, the consensus mechanism securing networks like Bitcoin BTC, which the SEC clarified also did not implicate securities laws in a similar staff statement last month. The SEC's staff statement was \""very clear for a subject that can be a little bit complicated,\"" said Lorien Gabel, the CEO of staking-focused crypto firm Figment. And its main upside appears to be saying that various activities U.S. companies might have shied away from in the past are okay now. \""They included some ancillary staking activities. For example, we provide insurance around slashing [and we also provide] modified unbonding periods ,\"" he said. \""And they said that actually doesn't mean that you're a manager of assets as a staking provider.\"" The SEC statement said companies that want to provide those types of services, or even pooled staking, can do so, he said. Thursday's statement is an incremental but important update from the regulator, said Alison Mangiero, the head of staking policy at the Crypto Council for Innovation. \""This reaffirms that there's going to be similar treatment for stakers that there is for miners. And I think it's especially important because, given under [former SEC Chair Gary] Gensler, there were so many enforcement actions that were focused on staking as a service … we saw a lot of those cases dismissed, and the Coinbase case dismissed with prejudice,\"" she said. \""We assumed that this would be the stance, but actually having a staff statement that asserts it, I think is crucially important.\"" The fact it came just days before the SEC faces a deadline on a number of applications to bring staking into spot ether ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is telling, she said. It's likely that the ETF providers would have received staking approvals regardless, but the SEC statement will likely start speeding up the process for securing those approvals, Gabel said. As with the SEC's previous staff statements, Thursday's included a footnote clarifying that it is very narrowly tailored and certain restrictions would apply. It is not a replacement for rulemaking done through the actual commissioners and \""has no legal force or effect,\"" the footnote said. \""This statement only addresses certain activities involving Covered Crypto Assets that do not have intrinsic economic properties or rights, such as generating a passive yield or conveying rights to future income, profits, or assets of a business enterprise,\"" another footnote said.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/news-analysis/2025/05/29/crypto-staking-doesnt-violate-us-securities-law-sec-says,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|REGULATION","News Analysis|SEC|Staking|Exclusive|News",cryptocompare
2025-05-30T03:21:23.000Z,"Fastex Expands U.S. Presence With Los Angeles Office","Fastex, a Dubai-based crypto exchange, is expanding its presence in the U.S., building out an office in Los Angeles, California. According to a Thursday announcement, Fastex will offer spot crypto trading services of tokens including bitcoin BTC, ether ETH, Cardano ADA, Solana SOL and its native utility token, Fasttoken FTN, to both retail and institutional investors in the U.S. Fastex’s American expansion comes as the U.S. continues to overhaul its approach to crypto regulation under President Donald Trump’s administration. Since Trump took office in January, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has retreated from the so-called regulation-by-enforcement approach to crypto it took under former Chair Gary Gensler, dropping a host of open investigations and closing ongoing litigation against crypto exchanges. In an interview with CoinDesk at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas, Fastex’s Chief Legal Officer and board member Vardan Khachatryan said that the SEC’s softened stance toward crypto regulation played a major role in the exchange’s decision to expand in the U.S., though he acknowledged that there is still no concrete legal framework for crypto in the country. “There has been enough of a policy change, at least in terms of [how the U.S. government is] viewing things, that allowed us to go for this,” Khachatryan said. “It’s still kind of a risk, but it’s a lower risk.” With a host of crypto companies returning to the U.S. due to the Trump Administration's crypto-friendly policies, cities like New York are hoping to attract companies expanding to the U.S. to set up shop in their jurisdictions. But, while Khachatryan said New York would be “the right place to be in terms of headquarters,” he said that, for now, the prospect of obtaining a BitLicense — the notoriously difficult-to-obtain crypto license issued by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) — is prohibitive. “I hope that things will change a bit,” Khachatryan said. New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who has branded himself the “Bitcoin Mayor” in an attempt to lure crypto companies to New York, called for the end to the BitLicense regime during a speech at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas on Wednesday.

The price is now correcting losses and might aim for a move above the $2.250 resistance. XRP price started a fresh decline below the $2.280 zone. The price is now trading below $2.270 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.270 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start another decline if it fails to clear the $2.2440 level. XRP Price Dips Further XRP price failed to clear the $0.3550 resistance and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . There was a move below the $0.3000 and $0.280 support levels. The price even dipped below the $0.220 support level. A low was formed at $0.2132 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor move above the $0.220 level. The price cleared the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2.3540 swing high to the $2.2132 low. The price is now trading below $2.30 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.2440 level. It is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2.3540 swing high to the $2.2132 low. The first major resistance is near the $2.270 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.270 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The next resistance is $2.30. A clear move above the $2.30 resistance might send the price toward the $2.320 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.350 resistance or even $2.3650 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.420. Another Drop? If XRP fails to clear the $2.270 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.180 level. The next major support is near the $2.160 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.160 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.120 support. The next major support sits near the $2.080 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level.

2025-05-30T03:04:29.000Z,"XXRP: Volatility On Top Of Volatility","Summary XRP exposure is possible in the US via the Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP ETF, despite the absence of spot ETFs or CEFs for XRP. XXRP uses swaps to provide leveraged XRP exposure, but carries heightened risk and volatility compared to spot products. XRP is already more volatile than other digital assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum. So XXRP is volatility on top of volatility. Long-term investors should use the futures ETF or wait for spot XRP ETFs rather than holding leveraged products like XXRP. In my recent coverage of the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund ETF ( OTC:BITW ) for Seeking Alpha, I made note of how it was becoming increasingly possible to mimic the top holdings of that fund but through allocating to various ETFs and closed-end funds in a traditional a self-directed IRA. At 90% combined allocation between Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), spot ETFs are useful tools for self-directing asset weightings. Allocating the 3% exposure to Solana ( SOL-USD ) is also quite easy given the OTC market offers two different closed-end funds as well as a futures-based ETF. 5% of BITW assets are in XRP ( XRP-USD ). Despite the US market lacking spot ETFs or OTC market CEF shares, traders can get exposed to XRP through the Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP ETF ( XXRP ). In this article, we'll look at Teucrium's fund details, how it allocates XRP exposure, and why speculators with longer term time horizons should wait for spot ETFs rather than sitting in XXRP shares. Fund Details & Objective The objective of the Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP ETF is very simple; XXRP aims to double the return of XRP on a daily basis. To its credit, Teucrium is very overt about the fact that the fund will ultimately lag the performance of XRP over time. We'll detail that a bit more in the risks section later in this article. Believe it or not, XXRP is not the only 2x leveraged XRP ETF in the market today. In the time since my May 21st BITW article , we have seen a second 2x leveraged XRP fund begin trading, with the Volatility Shares 2x XRP ETF ( XRPT ) launching on May 22nd. Here's a straightforward comparison between the funds: Fund Comparison XXRP XRPT Issuer Teucrium Volatility Shares LLC Inception 04/07/2025 05/22/2025 Expense Ratio 1.89% 0.94% AUM $100.24M $1.70M Source: Seeking Alpha With respect to being first to market, the only real advantage XXRP has over XRPT at this point in time is liquidity. With just over $100 million in AUM against less than $2 million for XRPT, traders will likely have a far easier time executing orders at desirable prices through XXRP if they want to go the leveraged fund route. Since these funds are not to be held for longer than a few days or weeks (at most), the expense ratio likely doesn't matter as much as the liquidity difference. But it is worth pointing out that XXRP is roughly double the price of XRPT, purely by the fees associated with holding the funds. XRP Swaps Since there isn't a spot ETF for XRP yet in the US market, XXRP utilizes swap agreements with global financial institutions that allow Teucrium and its counter-parties to make payments based on XRP reference assets or benchmarks. Those could include the CME CF XRP-Dollar Reference Rate, the CME CF XRP-Dollar Real-Time Index, or a handful of European XRP ETPs that are listed below: 21Shares XRP ETP Bitwise Physical XRP ETP Virtune XRP ETP WisdomTree Physical XRP ETP CoinShares Physical XRP ETP In addition to these 'XRP Swaps,' Teucrium may also hold XRP futures contracts and/or XRP options. But the point is, XXRP doesn't actually provide speculators with direct exposure to XRP. Which is definitely a consideration that US buyers should keep in mind if they want to minimize third-party risk to the degree that they can. That said, for this type of product, that concern is likely minimal. The larger concern is long term decay. 2x Leveraged ETF Risks As is generally the case with every leveraged ETF product in the market today, funds like XXRP are designed for short-term holding rather than long-term investment. For those seeking a tactical trading tool, 2x funds like XXRP can be great. The advantage they have over taking positions with margin is the leveraged funds limit downside. Trading with margin can result in a call to pledge more collateral. However, with leveraged ETFs, a trader can only lose what is put into the position. Furthermore, unlike something like 0DTE options, there is no expiration on leveraged ETF positions. So holding time can be as long as the idea is winning, or the trader has an ability to endure pain. On the latter, Teucrium's prospectus makes it very clear that XXRP is not designed for long-term holding and will ultimately lag the return of XRP if held for too long: The return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of its return for each day compounded over the period. The Fund’s returns for periods longer than a single day will very likely differ in amount, and possibly even direction, from the Fund’s stated multiple (2x) times the return of daily changes in the price of XRP for the same period. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund will lose money if XRP’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Fund will lose money even if the price of XRP increases. As I've said in my numerous articles covering at least a dozen leveraged ETFs prior to this one, it is imperative that entries and exits in these types of products are timed properly. Sustained periods of chop or sideways action will not help XXRP holders. While the trading history for XXRP is admittedly small since inception in early-April, we can already see how sideways action is bad for the fund: Data by YCharts The chart above shows the price performances of XRP and XXRP since April 28th. The price or XRP is roughly flat at 0.79% over the last month, yet XXRP is down nearly 10%. Some of this is due to the added volatility that comes with a 2x leveraged ETF - that volatility is entirely by design. But the volatility is compounded because XRP itself is also highly volatile. XRP Volatility I've covered XRP based on network fundamentals a handful of times for SA and recently updated that view back in April: For me, the chain usage data is actually pretty encouraging. We see transactions up over time, DAAs making highs, and even fees have noticeably increased in recent months. Still, price is well ahead of all of this action. However, even if one holds the view that XRP is a buy based on their own fundamental framework, it's important to keep in mind that any position in XXRP should likely be expressing more of a technical bull setup than a fundamental one. Crypto is already a highly volatile sector of the market, and when you get into the altcoins that volatility can get more intense. Such is the case with XRP. Volatility XRP BTC ETH 30D 0.61 0.35 0.92 90D 1.08 0.54 0.94 1Yr 0.98 0.49 0.73 Source: Messari The table above shows the volatility metrics for XRP, BTC, and ETH over 30 Day, 90 day, and 1 year time frames. In all but one time frame, XRP is more volatile than ETH and XRP is more volatile than BTC in all three time frames shared. Closing Takeaways Essentially, XXRP is volatility on top of volatility. XRP is already a very volatile asset over just about any time frame that you look at. Factor in leverage from a fund like XXRP, and we're talking about a financial product that must be actively managed by the trader who holds it. This is not a product that should be held for longer than a few days, in my view. Thus, timing the buy properly is imperative. For investors who want exposure to XRP without leverage, they can consider the Volatility Shares XRP ETF ( XRPI ) as an alternative. That fund utilizes futures contracts without the leverage to mimic XRP returns and was launched the same day as XRPT.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4791075-xxrp-volatility-on-top-of-volatility?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","XRP-USD|XXRP",cryptocompare

In January 2024, the crypto OTC infrastructure firm Finery Markets reported that institutional OTC volumes jumped 106% last year.Cointelegraph approached Hidden Road for comment regarding the estimated OTC volumes globally and in the US, but had not received a response by the time of publication.Rising institutional demandIn December 2024, Higgins highlighted a rising demand for institutional balance sheets from large institutions in an interview with Finance Magnates.“Servicing them [institutional investors] across traditional finance and digital asset ecosystems that have already converged presents a really unique opportunity for us in the marketplace.”Hidden Road’s OTC swap launch in the US marks one of the first products launched by the firm since the company entered a definitive agreement to be acquired by Ripple.Related: Taurus, Parfin partnership to provide crypto infrastructure to institutionsSoon after the deal was announced, Hidden Road received a broker-dealer license from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, a private US corporation and self-regulatory organization regulating member brokerage firms and exchange markets.Hidden Road is also known as one of the first companies to receive a Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) license in Europe, immediately after the framework entered into full force on Dec. 30, 2024.

2025-05-29T13:30:00.000Z,"How African innovators are using blockchain to solve real problems","While blockchain headlines in the West often focus on speculation and regulation, in Africa, it’s a different story, one rooted in necessity, innovation and grassroots adoption. The latest episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast explores this ground-up revolution with Kevin Imani, head of StarkWare’s Africa Venture Studio, who shares how communities across the continent are using blockchain to tackle real-world problems in finance, energy and connectivity.A student movement“Young students were using blockchain before it was mainstream,” Imani explained. From Kenya to Nigeria, local needs, not hype, drove early adoption. In many cases, it was students receiving digital currencies from abroad or freelancers getting paid in dollars and struggling to convert funds into local currency. With limited banking infrastructure or trust in government institutions, decentralized alternatives offered a lifeline.Imani highlighted how centralized systems like Kenya’s E-Mpesa changed access to finance, but still fall short for international payments or off-ramping digital assets. Related: Blockchain.com expands in Africa as local crypto rules take shape“You have to start becoming a trader almost,” he said, describing the convoluted process of converting stablecoins or crypto earnings into usable local funds. This trust gap has fueled peer-to-peer crypto usage. “These were kids holding stablecoins not to spend them, but to store value.” Even before regulators or startups built formal infrastructure, communities had already found use cases for blockchain.Blockchain beyond finance Beyond finance, African innovators are tapping blockchain to address energy insecurity. In rural Zambia, excess power from a mini hydro station could go to waste. Instead, residents can now use that surplus to mine Bitcoin, for example, generating revenue and creating a sustainable power loop. “It’s self-sustaining and reduces waste,” Imani said.Connectivity is another frontier. In areas where traditional internet providers fall short, decentralized WiFi hotspot networks are emerging. With blockchain, community members can share bandwidth and be compensated instantly and transparently. “You don’t need a middleman. It’s fair and trackable,” he said.Still, mainstream adoption remains cautious. Governments like those in Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa are in “standby mode,” focused more on consumer protection than full-scale implementation. But Imani remains optimistic: “The need is there. The technology is here. The only question is how we bridge that gap.”To hear the full conversation on The Clear Crypto Podcast, listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

2025-05-29T13:23:06.000Z,"Tim Berners-Lee says internet DNS should have been more decentralized","World Wide Web and hypertext markup language (HTML) inventor Tim Berners-Lee said that if he were building a domain name service (DNS) today, he would make it “more decentralized.”Speaking at ETH Prague on stage alongside Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, Berners-Lee reflected on early internet architecture decisions.“If I could go back […] I would make it more decentralized,“ he said.DNS was invented in 1983 by Paul Mockapetris, replacing the previous hosts.txt file-based system with a scalable, distributed system for naming IP addresses. Still, while Berners-Lee was not personally responsible for DNS development, he could have opted for a URL structure not tied to the DNS we know today, or he could have pushed for a decentralized alternative. Source: Mely.ethRelated: Decentralized naming could bring ‘next billion’ users to BitcoinCentralization of the DNSThe DNS system is highly centralized, particularly at its top levels of hierarchy. The root zone, which governs top-level domains such as .com and .org, is managed by the US-based nonprofit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).Furthermore, the most authoritative servers are operated by a handful of organizations, further centralizing the system. This allows for easy censorship and control by governments that can unilaterally seize or block domain names.This degree of centralization also makes outages due to centralized service disruption more likely. Control over root zones and domain policies is also concentrated in a few regions and among a select group of stakeholders.There are also concerns regarding privacy because centralized DNS queries can be monitored, logged and intercepted by internet service providers and other intermediaries.Related: Community split on ENS petition against Unstoppable Domains patentCrypto’s solution to the problemDecentralized alternatives to the DNS system are being developed. The most well-known is the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), which maps human-readable names to Ethereum addresses, content on the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS), or other data.Another alternative is Unstoppable Domains. Its system mints domains as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Ethereum and Polygon.ENS has seen a fair share of adoption. In late 2024, ENS Labs also partnered with PayPal and Venmo, sparking speculation about how this partnership is likely to boost mainstream adoption.IPFS runs on Ethereum smart contracts and aims to be user-owned and censorship-resistant. Currently, it is primarily used in Web3 applications, wallets and decentralized websites.Another alternative is Handshake (HNS), which aims to be a decentralized and permissionless naming protocol that is compatible with traditional DNS. A project with a similar aim is Namecoin (NMC), an early Bitcoin fork designed specifically to offer .bit domains and store DNS records onchain with censorship resistance.IPFS is also accompanied by its own Inter-Planetary Name System (IPNS), which enables mutable naming for IPFS addresses (hashes). URLs generated this way point to specific content, not servers.A non-crypto alternative to DNS is OpenNIC. This is a user-run project that offers non-ICANN domains, aiming to decentralize control through community governance.Magazine: Move to Portugal to become a crypto digital nomad — Everybody else is",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/tim-berners-lee-says-dns-should-have-been-more-decentralized?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Ethereum Foundation turns to DeFi for cash","The Ethereum Foundation (EF) has borrowed $2 million in GHO, a decentralized stablecoin developed by Aave, in a move signaling deeper engagement with decentralized finance (DeFi) strategies.  In a May 29 X post, Aave founder Stani Kulechov said the foundation borrowed $2 million in GHO tokens. “The EF is not only supplying ETH to Aave, but also borrowing from Aave,” Kulechov wrote, describing the development as “the full DeFi circle.”GHO is a decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin native to the Aave Protocol. Unlike centralized stablecoins, GHO is governed by Aave’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which oversees interest rates, collateral requirements and facilitator selection. The move highlights the EF’s growing engagement with the DeFi ecosystem, moving toward more sophisticated treasury strategies. The foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Source: Stani KulechovEthereum Foundation previously deployed $120 million in DeFiThe foundation’s move to borrow GHO follows a previous $120 million deployment into various protocols, signaling a shift in how it manages its crypto holdings. In February, the EF deployed 45,000 Ether (ETH) across different DeFi protocols, including Aave, Spark and Compound. At the time, the Ether was worth $120 million. Kulechov previously described the fund deployment as the foundation’s “biggest allocation in DeFi.” Because of the move, the Aave founder said that DeFi will win, expressing optimism as the EF added liquidity to the protocol.Apart from Kulechov, community members also celebrated the move, supporting the EF’s ETH holdings management shift. A community member said the development was a win, saying the foundation should “keep it up,” while an X user said it would be positive if the EF continued to use their funds this way. Related: Ethereum Foundation unveils security initiative to supplant legacy systemsCriticisms of the foundation selling Ether In January, Ethereum community members called on the foundation to explore alternatives to selling ETH for operational funding.

He called the practice “insane,” urging the EF to stake or use DeFi instead of selling. Anthony Sassano, host of The Daily Gwei, proposed that the EF stake part of its ETH and sell the staking rewards.

Mainstream browsers will also integrate agentic capabilities or build interoperability with purpose-built agentic browsers as AI becomes cheaper, according to Zhu.However, the most significant adoption will come within the next decade when onchain and offchain environments will be completely merged for internet users, Zhu said, adding:“Agentic browsers are poised to become the default entry point — much like smartphones replaced feature phones.”In the long term, Donut aims to support payments, gaming, content creation and social interaction, all within a single crypto-native browser. The company also plans to leverage advancements in decentralized identity and confidential computing to turn the browser into a personal “crypto CFO” for retail users.

SOC 2 Type 1 is a report assessing a company’s controls related to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality or privacy at a specific point in time. Such an audit verifies that the firm’s controls meet trust service criteria at the time of the check.SOC 1 Type 1 is a similar report focused on internal controls over financial reporting at a specific point in time. This audit evaluates whether the controls are appropriately designed, but does not assess their effectiveness over time.Lastly, ISO 27001 is an international standard specifying requirements for an information security management system. These standards help manage risks pertaining to data confidentiality, integrity and availability through a continuous improvement framework.To obtain this ISO certificate, a company must demonstrate both the documentation and implementation of controls. Sol Strategies’ Wald explained that all these measures are meant to ensure institutional trust:“By achieving SOC 2 Type 1 and SOC 1 Type 1, alongside our ISO 27001 certification, we’ve demonstrated that institutional clients can trust SOL Strategies with their Solana staking needs.”The compliance efforts come as the firm continues to position itself as a major Solana validator.

Source: T-Bank“The tool allows you to invest in cryptocurrency in rubles through a familiar application — safely and within the legal framework of the Russian Federation, without opening an account on a crypto exchange and difficulties with protecting your wallet,” the bank said.T-Bank’s new “smart asset” offering is issued through the Russian state-backed tokenization platform Atomyze and is available exclusively to accredited investors.Direct crypto investments still not encouragedWhile greenlighting local lenders to offer crypto products, the Russian central bank still maintains a restrictive approach regarding direct cryptocurrency investment.“The Bank of Russia still does not recommend financial institutions and their clients to invest directly in cryptocurrencies,” the Bank of Russia said in a statement.Related: Russia arrests Blum co-founder Vladimir Smerkis on fraud chargesThe central bank also mentioned the ongoing government discussions on the potential launch of an experimental regime that would allow certain investors to trade crypto assets like Bitcoin directly.Russia’s estimated CEX holdings are at $9.2 billionIn its latest financial stability review, the Bank of Russia estimated Russians’ crypto holdings on centralized exchanges (CEXs) at 827 billion rubles ($9.2 billion).According to the authority, Bitcoin is leading Russians’ CEX holdings with a 62% share, with Ether (ETH) following at 22%. Stablecoins like Tether USDt (USDT) and Circle’s USDC (USDC) ranked third with a share of 15.9%.Some local crypto enthusiasts observed that the actual figure of cryptocurrency held by Russians is significantly bigger than the estimated CEX holdings reported by the Bank of Russia.“I know that [Pavel] Durov and [Alexey] Bilyuchenko alone have more money in their wallets than this amount,” Sergey Mendeleev, founder of the digital settlement exchange Exved, wrote on his Telegram channel.

At current prices, the stash is valued at about $7.6 billion.Arkham said the newly identified wallets bring Strategy’s total identified holdings to $54.5 billion. If accurate, the findings suggest that Arkham has mapped out most of the company’s stash, making it the first entity to publicly associate the wallets with the firm. “Saylor said he would never reveal his addresses. So, we did,” Arkham wrote, adding that the amount represents 87.5% of the total Bitcoin holdings of Strategy. Cointelegraph reached out to Arkham and Strategy for comment but had not received a response by publication time.  Source: Arkham IntelligenceStrategy chairman says publishing addresses “not a good idea” Arkam’s claims follow comments from Saylor about the risks of publishing wallet addresses. At the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Saylor said that publishing wallet addresses is dangerous for companies holding Bitcoin. “No institutional grade or enterprise security analyst would think it’s a good idea to publish all of the wallet addresses such that you can be traced back and forth,” Saylor said. The executive said making wallets public allows every future transaction to be scrutinized, exposing a company to risks that may not be immediately apparent. To highlight his point, Saylor suggested using artificial intelligence to explore the issue. Saylor said if a user puts AI in deep think mode and asks about security problems associated with publishing wallet addresses, the executive said the response could get “50 pages” of security problems.Related: Metaplanet issues $21M in bonds to buy Bitcoin, a day after $50M raiseArkham previously accused of mislabelling walletsWhile blockchain data is publicly available, the accuracy of claims related to wallet ownership has been questioned before. At the height of the Mantra token collapse, Mantra CEO John Mullin denied accusations of insiders dumping their token.

You can have tax-exempt bonds and other bonds. It is time for the first time in the history of this city to have a financial instrument that is made for those who are holders of Bitcoin,” he said.“I believe we need to have a Bitbond, and I am going to push and fight to get a Bitbond in New York so you can do those same bond investments in New York City.”New York City Mayor Eric Adams wants a Bitcoin bond and to axe the State BitLicense program.

Source: CoinMarketCapThe Trump administration has reportedly filed an appeal to the court’s decision and Hundal said that regardless of whether it presents a new justification for the tariffs, the market sentiment has already changed.“It blows a hole in trade talks either way, and that means we’re likely to witness a significant repositioning in the market.”On April 2, Trump signed an executive order and claimed emergency powers, levying so-called “reciprocal tariffs” on every country starting at 10%.Trump’s initial tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China, introduced in early February, were widely seen as the primary catalyst behind Bitcoin falling below $100,000 and staying under the psychological level until May 8, as broader macroeconomic uncertainty intensified.“The trade war likely delayed a meaningful greed, really — but it didn’t bury it. The trend is higher,” Hundal said. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes said, “Buy everything round dos.”Traders ponder “green candles” tomorrowCrypto analyst Bitcoin Ranchy said, “So Trump tariffs are illegal?
