2025-05-30T15:50:15.000Z,"Unstoppable Bitcoin Rally: Why Profit Taking Signals Continued Growth","BitcoinWorld Unstoppable Bitcoin Rally: Why Profit Taking Signals Continued Growth Is the recent uptick in profit taking by long-term Bitcoin holders a sign that the current Bitcoin rally is running out of steam? For many observers, seeing large amounts of Bitcoin move after significant price increases triggers alarm bells, conjuring fears of a market top. However, according to insights from leading crypto analytics firm Santiment, this particular instance of profit taking might be a fundamentally different signal – one that actually supports the continuation of the bullish trend in the crypto market . Understanding Holder Behavior in the Crypto Market In any market, understanding the actions of participants is crucial. In the volatile crypto market , deciphering holder behavior can offer unique insights into potential future price movements. Santiment, known for its on-chain data analysis, points to a specific metric that sheds light on what long-term holders are doing: the Mean Dollar Invested Age (MDIA). What exactly is MDIA? It’s a metric that calculates the average age of all Bitcoin on the network, weighted by the price at which each coin last moved. Think of it as tracking how long, on average, investors have held onto their Bitcoin without selling or moving it. When MDIA increases, it suggests that coins are sitting idle in wallets, indicating accumulation or HODLing behavior. When MDIA decreases, it means older coins are being moved, typically signifying selling or spending by those who acquired Bitcoin some time ago. Santiment’s recent data shows a notable decline in Bitcoin’s MDIA since roughly mid-April. This decline is the key indicator of increased coin circulation, driven by holders who have been in the market for a while – the ones now engaging in profit taking . Why Profit Taking Might Fuel the Bitcoin Rally Traditionally, a decrease in MDIA due to selling might be seen as bearish. However, Santiment argues that a falling MDIA during an ongoing bull market is historically a strong bullish indicator. This seems counter-intuitive at first glance, but here’s the logic: When long-term holders, who bought Bitcoin at much lower prices, start selling, they are essentially taking profits. This action does several things that can sustain a Bitcoin rally : Provides Liquidity: Their selling provides the necessary supply for new buyers entering the market or existing holders wanting to increase their position. This prevents the rally from stalling due to a lack of available coins at current prices. Redistributes Supply: Bitcoin moves from ‘old hands’ to ‘new hands’. If the new buyers are accumulating with a long-term perspective, this fresh capital and renewed conviction can add momentum. Prevents Overheating (Initially): Unlike speculative short-term traders who might panic sell at the first sign of trouble, long-term holders selling into strength can create healthy pullbacks or consolidations, preventing the market from becoming excessively parabolic and prone to a sharp crash. It’s a more controlled distribution. Confirms Price Levels: The fact that there is sufficient demand to absorb the selling pressure from profitable holders validates the current Bitcoin price levels and builds a stronger foundation for further increases. Santiment emphasizes that this type of circulation, where older coins move, is characteristic of healthy bull markets where value is being transferred and new capital is entering. It’s distinct from a scenario where short-term holders are rapidly trading back and forth, which can indicate frothiness and potential tops. Is This Holder Behavior Different This Time? Every market cycle has unique characteristics, but the underlying principles of holder behavior often rhyme. The current decline in MDIA suggests that the long-term conviction that defined the earlier stages of accumulation is now transitioning into strategic distribution by those who have held for years. This is a natural phase in a bull market. Consider the alternative: if MDIA continued to rise indefinitely during a rally, it would mean virtually no one is selling. While this might sound bullish (extreme HODLing), it would actually make the market illiquid, leading to extremely volatile price spikes followed by potential crashes when the inevitable selling eventually occurs from fewer, larger holders. The current pattern, according to Santiment’s analysis, suggests a more sustainable, albeit potentially choppy, ascent for the Bitcoin price . Key Takeaways and Actionable Insights For those navigating the crypto market , understanding metrics like MDIA and the implications of profit taking by different types of holders is invaluable. Here are some actionable insights: Look Beyond Simple Price Action: Don’t just react to price dips or large sell orders. Investigate the underlying on-chain data. Monitor MDIA: A falling MDIA during a bull trend is often a positive sign, indicating healthy market activity rather than capitulation. Distinguish Holder Types: Recognize that selling by long-term holders can have a different market impact than selling by short-term speculators. Stay Informed: Follow analyses from reputable firms like Santiment to get deeper insights into market dynamics beyond basic charts. While no single metric guarantees future performance, the MDIA provides a powerful lens through which to view the current Bitcoin rally . It suggests that the recent increase in coin movement isn’t a red flag waving goodbye to the bull market, but potentially the necessary fuel to keep the engine running. Conclusion: Why Profit Taking May Sustain the Rally In conclusion, the recent trend of profit taking observed among Bitcoin holders, as indicated by the declining Mean Dollar Invested Age (MDIA), appears to be a constructive development for the ongoing Bitcoin rally . Rather than signaling an impending top, this movement of older coins into circulation provides essential liquidity, facilitates redistribution to new market participants, and helps create a more stable foundation for the rising Bitcoin price within the broader crypto market . By analyzing metrics like MDIA and understanding the nuances of holder behavior , investors can gain a clearer perspective on the market’s health and potential trajectory, recognizing that sometimes, selling isn’t a sign of weakness, but a necessary component of continued growth.

White House official Miller also supported Trump's statements. Miller said, “We have a wide range of options to hold China accountable,” and indicated that the US could take new steps against Beijing. Miller also said that they would not allow China to take away US production capacity and that espionage activities carried out through student visas would be stopped.

The embassy spokesperson said, “China calls on the US to end discriminatory restrictions and jointly protect the consensus reached at the high-level talks in Geneva.” China and the United States continue to maintain contacts on various occasions at the bilateral and multilateral levels in the economic and trade fields, and both sides have expressed their concerns, the spokesman said. *This is not investment advice.

The rising exchange outflows and other essential factors are also bullish factors, suggesting that the asset’s price may head north soon. Whales Filled Their Bags The renowned analyst Ali Martinez unveiled on X that large investors scooped up more than 20,000 BTC in the past two days alone. Whales have bought over 20,000 #Bitcoin $BTC in the last 48 hours! pic.twitter.com/cCmQOpUV8X — Ali (@ali_charts) May 29, 2025 According to Martinez’s chart, the collective bitcoin holdings of this investor cohort are just north of 4.7 million assets, which represents around 23.7% of the circulating supply. Accumulation from whales is generally viewed as a bullish factor that may be a precursor of a price rally. It shows that such investors have increased their confidence in the asset, which could encourage smaller players to join the bandwagon as well . Numerous X users reacted to the post, with some assuming that Michael Saylor could be among the individuals contributing to the buying spree. The company he co-founded has become the world’s largest corporate holder of bitcoin, while he personally owns over 17,000 BTC, as he confirmed last year. Additional Bullish Elements The aforementioned actions of the whales are not the only factor suggesting that the price of BTC could be on the verge of a rally. Over the past month, the supply of the asset on exchanges has dried up. Ali Martinez revealed that 30,000 BTC had been moved off centralized platforms within the timeframe, while the chart below shows that the exchange netflows were positive in only seven out of the last 30 days. BTC Exchange Netflow, Source: CryptoQuant This suggests a shift from these entities toward self-custody solutions, which reduces the immediate selling pressure. Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) should also be taken into account . The momentum oscillator measures the speed and magnitude of recent price changes and varies from 0 to 100. When the ratio drops below 30, it typically indicates that the asset may be oversold and could be poised for a resurgence. Conversely, anything above 70 is interpreted as a bearish element. Over the past several hours, the RSI has been on a downward trend , currently standing just north of the lower mark.

The Wall Street bank estimated that spot bitcoin ETFs saw $358 million of redemptions yesterday, according to a Friday report, with just one, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) attracting a net inflow. IBIT gathered in a net $125 million, the bank observed. In contrast, Fidelity’s FBTC saw net outflows of $166 million, leading the redemptions, the report said. Other major contributors included the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) -$107 million, ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) -$89 million and the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) -$71 million, the bank said JPMorgan said smaller outflows were also noted across the remaining issuers.

2025-05-30T15:35:30.000Z,"Revolut eyes the US for expansion","Mazen ElJundi, Head of Crypto at Revolut, confirmed that the crypto-friendly digital bank is reintroducing its cryptocurrency services for users in the United States. The relaunch signals Revolut’s strategic intent to deepen its presence in the rapidly evolving decentralized finance (DeFi) space, reflecting broader momentum toward integrated financial ecosystems. The announcement also aligns with the firm’s wider strategy to connect traditional finance with Web3 by building strategic industry partnerships and developing product offerings. Revolut eyes US for expansion After announcing plans to revive its US cryptocurrency services , Revolut is expected to reintroduce Bitcoin and Ethereum tokens previously available on the platform. However, the official list of supported assets has yet to be confirmed. The move underscores the British fintech firm’s commitment to capitalizing on the growing demand for crypto and blockchain-based payment solutions in the US. Revolut also announced its partnership with Pyth Network . ElJundi commented on the company’s announcements revealing the role of reliable market data for advances in the DeFi space. ElJundi said their collaboration with Pyth marks a key moment in Revolut’s mission to update the world of finance. He further stated that as decentralized finance becomes more popular, Pyth’s role as a core part of the industry will enable the bank to take advantage of this change. Martin Mignot, a partner at the European venture capital firm Index Ventures and an early investor in Revolut, emphasized that one can not truly be the top player if they are not number one in the US. He referred to the US as the biggest consumer market globally. Moreover, Siddhartha Jajodia, the CEO of Revolut in the US, states that the country is essential for its goal to become a “global bank.” This made their mission clearer: to connect with millions more customers targeting the US. Analysts speculate Revolut’s arrival in the US could spur more competition for crypto offerings. This strategic move may attract regulatory attention and technological progress to achieve a significant share of the retail investment sector. Revolut previously launched its cryptocurrency services in the EU and UK Previous expansions by Revolut in regions including the EU and UK have led to incremental user growth, though they have not directly impacted major asset prices. Revolut, the biggest digital bank in the UK, stormed onto the UK scene a decade ago. Its easy-to-use mobile apps and lower fees for services such as overseas transactions and cross-border transfers have won millions of customers. The proportion of UK adults using neobanks soared from 16% in 2018 to 50% last year, according to data providers from reliable sources. Revolut is a neobank, which means it is a digital bank that provides different banking and financial services mainly through its mobile app, without the need for regular physical branches. It stands out as one of the leading neobanks, competing with other companies like Wise, N26, and Nubank. The fintech firm wants to increase this user percentage further, focusing on the larger US market with $24tn of assets. This is because the US market has several elements that may be attractive to its users. For example, interchange fees—the charges imposed by card networks like Visa and Mastercard on behalf of banks—are significantly higher in the US than in the EU or UK, where such fees are capped. As a result, a US customer generates more profit for the same volume of payments. The US is also super competitive in retail banking, where over 3,000 institutions offer attractive customer rewards and loyalty deals. Some critics say that European fintechs may not offer enough yet to attract customers away from their existing banks. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Bitcoin ETFs Emerge As Preferred Safe Haven According to a Bloomberg report, US Bitcoin ETFs have attracted over $9 billion in inflows in the past five weeks, primarily driven by BlackRock Inc.’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT). In contrast, gold-backed funds have seen outflows exceeding $2.8 billion during the same time frame. Related Reading: Can XRP Market Cap Touch $1.5 Trillion? Analyst Reveals The Math Behind It This divergence in investor behavior comes as easing trade tensions have diminished demand for traditional safe havens like gold. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is increasingly being recognized as a viable alternative store of value amid growing concerns about US fiscal stability. Furthermore, the market’s leading cryptocurrency reached a record high of $111,980, buoyed by favorable regulatory developments and rising macroeconomic uncertainty. Although gold remains up more than 25% this year, it has retreated from its recent peaks, currently trading approximately $190 below its all-time high. BTC’s Advantages Over Gold Analysts suggest that this rotation towards Bitcoin ETFs indicates a growing acceptance of the cryptocurrency as a legitimate hedge within investment portfolios. Christopher Wood, global equity strategist at Jefferies, expressed optimism for both gold and Bitcoin, noting their effectiveness as hedges against currency debasement in the G7 nations. However, skeptics argue that Bitcoin’s notorious volatility still undermines its position as a true safe haven. Historical instances of macroeconomic shocks have shown Bitcoin falling sharply alongside other risk assets. Yet, some experts believe that Bitcoin’s decentralized nature gives it an advantage over gold in times of financial system risks. Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, highlighted Bitcoin’s dual role as a hedge against both private sector risks, such as the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023, and government-related concerns, including the stability of the US Treasury. Kendrick pointed out that recent threats to Federal Reserve (Fed) independence, alongside tariff escalations and broader concerns about US policy credibility, further bolster Bitcoin’s appeal.

Dilin Wu, a research strategist at Pepperstone, noted that Bitcoin’s intraday correlation with major indices like the Nasdaq, as well as with the dollar and gold, has significantly decreased. The backdrop of growing fiscal strain has intensified the discourse surrounding these assets. Moody’s recently downgraded the US from its last triple-A credit rating, citing concerns over ballooning deficits and national debt. This downgrade aligns the US with other ratings agencies, including Fitch and S&P Global, which already rate the country below the top tier. Despite the recent surge in Bitcoin’s popularity, gold continues to outperform on a year-to-date basis, boasting gains of about 25% compared to Bitcoin’s rise of approximately 15%.

2025-05-30T15:30:25.000Z,"Highlights from the Bitcoin 2025 Conference in Las Vegas","From May 27th to 29th, 2025, Las Vegas became the epicenter of the global Bitcoin community as Bitcoin 2025 convened, marking a pivotal moment for the industry. Bitcoiners, digital asset-aligned politicians, and leading Bitcoin companies converged to forge connections and strategise as increasing regulatory acceptance and integration into traditional finance has already begun to reshape the landscape. The atmosphere buzzed with optimism as participants explored the growing momentum of Bitcoin’s adoption, solidifying its position as a significant force within the rapidly evolving global financial system. The Most Important Announcements to Emerge from Bitcoin 2025 The Bitcoin 2025 conference represents a cornerstone gathering for the global Bitcoin community, uniting individuals from diverse backgrounds, including developers, miners, and institutions, to champion the vision of sound money and financial freedom through collaboration, innovation, and a shared belief in the enduring potential of Bitcoin as a decentralised and resilient monetary network. Let’s take a look at some of the most exciting news to be announced at this year’s event. US Vice President JD Vance Gives a Powerful Pro-Bitcoin Speech During his address at the Bitcoin 2025 conference, Vice President JD Vance articulated a significant shift in the US government’s approach to digital assets, framing Bitcoin’s growth not just as a technological innovation, but as a reflection of a broader, decentralised movement. He emphasised a deliberate alignment between the administration’s priorities and the values of the Bitcoin community, asserting a commitment to fostering its expansion and resisting what he characterised as undue bureaucratic interference. Vance laid out a strategic vision for the future, focusing on promoting widespread adoption amongst American citizens and advocating for a regulatory framework designed to support Bitcoin’s integration into the national economy. He accentuated the importance of empowering the community itself, arguing that Bitcoin’s continued success hinged on active participation and a direct dialogue between the people and their government, suggesting a departure from previous administrations’ approaches to the sector. Don Trump Jr. and Rumble CEO Chris Pavlovski Announce Bitcoin Treasury Don Trump Jr. and Rumble CEO Chris Pavlovski articulated a strategic alignment with the current administration’s approach to digital assets, characterised by the establishment of a significant crypto treasury and a deliberate investment in Bitcoin’s potential. The pair emphasised the evolving political landscape, framing the administration’s support as a catalyst for a wider shift within the financial sector. Highlighting the formation of a substantial $2.5 billion crypto treasury and a series of strategic partnerships, including an alliance with the mining company Hut 8 , Trump Jr. and Pavlovski positioned Rumble as a key participant in a rapidly developing landscape. They underscored a belief that the administration’s pro-crypto stance represented a fundamental change, suggesting a broader adoption trend and a repositioning within the industry, referencing a shared vulnerability to regulatory scrutiny. US Senator Cynthia Lummis Discuss BTC Reserve & Stablecoin Legislation US Senator Cynthia Lummis outlined a strategic approach to regulating and integrating digital assets, emphasising the necessity of addressing market structure and stablecoin legislation to support evolving industry practices. She acknowledged the crucial role of supporting businesses involved in Bitcoin transactions, from custodial services to lending, and highlighted the need for a flexible regulatory framework capable of accommodating diverse applications. Senator Lummis emphasised the importance of establishing a streamlined tax system for smaller Bitcoin transactions and addressed the challenges presented by the US government’s historically cautious stance toward digital assets. She expressed a perspective where Bitcoin could serve as a critical strategic asset, not just for economic stability but also for bolstering national defence and mitigating potential geopolitical risks, particularly concerning global economic influence. Paolo Ardoino Announces That Tether Will Become World’s Biggest Bitcoin Mining Company During his presentation at Bitcoin 2025, Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether & CTO at Bitfinex , unveiled a significant strategic shift, asserting that the company would become the world’s largest Bitcoin mining operation. Ardoino detailed Tether’s Bitcoin holdings, exceeding 100,000 coins, alongside substantial reserves of US Treasury bonds totaling $120 billion. He underscored Tether’s origins as a Bitcoin-centric organisation, emphasising the company’s deep-rooted commitment to the cryptocurrency’s underlying principles. Ardoino highlighted a considerable investment, estimated at $2 billion, dedicated to energy production and Bitcoin mining activities, positioning Tether as a key player in decentralised infrastructure. Ardoino introduced a novel AI system, dubbed “QVAC,” designed with societal rather than corporate objectives in mind. Notably, he described QVAC’s operational structure: an AI agent possessing its own non-custodial wallet,and operating independently under pre-determined terms. Alongside this development, Tether announced a collaboration with Rumble to launch a dedicated Bitcoin wallet, alongside a supplementary stablecoin portfolio, signalling a broadening strategy to integrate Bitcoin into broader financial applications. Ark Labs Announces Arkade Native Bitcoin Execution Layer At Bitcoin 2025, Ark Labs unveiled Arkade, a novel application designed to introduce programmable capabilities directly onto the Bitcoin network, operating as a dedicated execution layer. Following a recent funding round, Arkade seeks to unlock new possibilities for financial applications while preserving the core security and decentralised nature of Bitcoin itself, eschewing the use of sidechains or alternative consensus mechanisms. Arkade functions by virtualising Bitcoin’s transaction layer, allowing developers to build sophisticated applications without requiring modifications to the underlying protocol. Early collaborations with established players like Tether, Boltz , Breez , and Mempool demonstrate the growing interest in this approach, which aims to transform Bitcoin from solely a store of value into a dynamically adaptable and universally accessible financial platform, a shift anticipated to represent a significant advancement within the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. Saylor Expresses Doubt About Proof of Reserves for Strategy Michael Saylor voiced strong opposition to publishing on-chain proof of reserves for Strategy , arguing that the practice inherently compromises the security of institutions employing this method. He presented a core concern: the increased vulnerability of custodians, exchanges, and investors due to the public disclosure of their Bitcoin holdings. Saylor’s resistance stemmed from two primary arguments. Firstly, he asserted that publishing wallet addresses creates an amplified attack vector, exposing institutions to heightened risks from hackers, hostile actors, and nation-state interference. Secondly, he emphasised that existing proof-of-reserves systems only demonstrate asset ownership without addressing potential liabilities, advocating instead for robust, legally-backed audits conducted by established, “Big Four” accounting firms to provide a more secure and verifiable assessment of financial health. NYC May Eric Adams Announces Bit-Bond New York City Mayor Eric Adams formally announced the city’s intention to issue a “Bit Bond,” a novel financial instrument designed specifically for Bitcoin holders. Framing this move as a deliberate step toward embracing innovation, Adams expressed a return to welcoming the cryptocurrency community, particularly those who had previously sought refuge outside of New York due to regulatory challenges. Adams’ announcement was characterised by a desire to reassert the city’s leadership within the digital asset space. He framed the Bit Bond as a tangible signal of New York’s commitment to fostering a supportive environment for Bitcoin, alongside plans to integrate blockchain technology into city services like record keeping and revenue collection, reflecting a broader strategy to engage and empower its residents within the digital economy. Adam Back Unveils Blockstream’s Plan to Boost Bitcoin Infrastructure Adam Back announced a strategic vision for Blockstream , based on scaling Bitcoin’s adoption to encompass a projected trillion-dollar market. He discussed the nascent stage of Bitcoin’s evolution, highlighting growing engagement from major players, from governmental figures to institutional leaders, and framed the company’s role as a foundational contributor to this expansion. Back detailed Blockstream’s planned infrastructural developments, focusing on simplifying the user experience for Bitcoin adoption and focusing on self-custody as a core component. The company’s roadmap included the creation of a unified platform integrating consumer-grade tools with enterprise solutions, alongside a strong commitment to robust security and a “Bitcoin-first” architectural approach, ultimately aiming to establish Bitcoin as the dominant foundation for global finance. Saifedean Ammous Comments on Tether and Bitcoin as a Reserve Asset Saifedean Ammous presented a compelling case for Bitcoin’s eventual dominance in the global financial system, arguing that the U.S. dollar’s decline was an inevitable consequence of its inflationary nature. He highlighted Tether’s role as a critical bridge in this transition, anticipating a scenario where Bitcoin reserves would significantly surpass U.S. dollar holdings. Ammous’ argument centered on a self-reinforcing cycle: increasing demand for Tether, driven by concerns over the devaluing dollar, would spur Tether to acquire more Bitcoin, which in turn would drive up the price of Bitcoin. He characterised this process as a “transition monetary system,” predicting a future where Bitcoin, rather than the dollar, would represent the primary store of value, a future he described as unstoppable. Human Rights Foundation Donates 8 BTC to Freedom Projects The Human Rights Foundation has announced a transformative investment of $80 million in Bitcoin, distributed through its Bitcoin Development Fund to 298 projects operating across 62 countries worldwide. This substantial grant program strategically targets the development of decentralized technologies and their application in regions grappling with economic instability, political repression, and limited access to traditional financial systems. The fund’s focus extends beyond simply providing capital, it’s designed to build resilient infrastructure encompassing open-source Bitcoin development, localised educational programs, and the creation of secure, self-custodial wallets, all with the ultimate goal of empowering individuals to circumvent censorship and safeguard their assets. This initiative directly addresses critical gaps in financial inclusion, particularly in underserved communities where traditional banking systems offer little recourse. Projects like “Bitcoin Boma” in Malawi, which teaches Bitcoin in local languages, and “Stringer News,” a censorship-resistant media platform, demonstrate a targeted approach to building financial freedom and promoting secure communication in regions facing economic and political restrictions. By fostering a network of decentralised solutions, the HRF’s Bitcoin Development Fund represents a powerful tool for safeguarding human rights and promoting a more equitable and resilient global financial landscape. Block Announces Lightning Network Payments Strategy At Bitcoin 2025, Block unveiled a strategic push to establish Bitcoin as a viable everyday currency, centered around expanding access through integrated payment solutions and bolstering the Lightning Network. Following the official launch of Bitcoin payments through Square POS, allowing merchants to accept Bitcoin directly in-store, Block simultaneously orchestrated a world-record Lightning event, showcasing the network’s scalability and speed. This initiative directly addresses the challenge of transitioning Bitcoin beyond its role as a store of value, prioritizing its utility within daily transactions. Block’s efforts extend beyond a single product launch. The company’s commitment to Bitcoin’s adoption is underscored by its operational infrastructure, including operating one of the world’s largest Lightning Network nodes and facilitating automated Bitcoin conversions for over 1,700 merchants.

After publicly declaring his exit from leverage trading earlier this month, on-chain data shows Wynn has now opened a fresh $50 million long position on Bitcoin ( BTC ), a striking reversal from his earlier stance, and one that puts him back in the line of fire. According to data tracked via Arkham and Hyperliquid , the new BTC position sits at 437 BTC with 40x leverage, valued at just over $46.1 million at an entry price of $105,560. The mark price at last check was hovering around $105,571, leaving the position nearly breakeven with a razor-thin unrealized profit of $2,086 — a +0.2% move, essentially noise at this scale. https://twitter.com/arkham/status/1928457983639396586 With a liquidation level of $102,849, even a modest 2.5% dip from current price action could wipe out the position entirely. Just these for now Hoping BTC pulls lower but i don’t see it pic.twitter.com/wd9751v27t — James Wynn 🐳 (@JamesWynnReal) May 30, 2025 James Wynn was only just liquidated for $100 million This aggressive bet follows Wynn’s prior catastrophic loss, where he was liquidated for over $100 million , one of the largest individual perp losses publicly recorded this year. The trader has been moving capital aggressively. Blockchain data shows multiple high-value inflows and outflows between Binance, Hyperliquid, and self-custodial wallets. In just the past 48 hours, over $8 million in USDC has been routed through Wynn’s wallets, with several tranches split between 500K and 2.7M USDC at a time, typical of positioning behavior for large directional bets. For context, Bitcoin is currently trading just above $105,500, down 3% in the past 24 hours and over 5% from recent local highs.

2025-05-30T15:16:46.000Z,"Why MSTY's High Yield Could Fly Even Higher As Strategy's Volatility Potentially Rebounds","Summary MSTY's 140% dividend yield remains sustainable and could rise further, driven by MSTR's unique volatility and leveraged Bitcoin exposure. Active management allows MSTY to generate strong premiums even as MSTR's volatility declines, supporting robust and growing monthly payouts. MSTY's structure (blending Treasuries, cash, and covered calls) mitigates downside risk and enhances yield potential in choppy or range-bound markets. Even with potential declines in volatility, MSTY is likely to provide huge yields, making it an incredible income vehicle. About four months ago, I covered the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA: MSTY ) for the first time, explaining why I believed that its 100% dividend yield was sustainable. My argument has played out well, with MSTY not only sustaining hefty payouts, but even raising them. Even in what has been a rather challenging period for Strategy ( MSTR ), including its shares experiencing a significant m/Nav compression in recent months, MSTY's yield farming strategy keeps going strong. In fact, the ETF has achieved a total return of 6.64% since my article on Jan. 25th, outperforming the S&P 500's total return of -0.8%, even with some NAV erosion on the way. Today, I aim to revisit the ETF's investment case, and explain why today's 140% dividend yield (on a TTM basis or 134% yield based on the latest payout's run rate), not only remains sustainable, but could even move higher, much like what happened since my previous article. The MSTY Magic: It's All About Harvesting Volatility Now, for those unfamiliar with the ETF, allow me to provide a quick overview of what it's all about. So, at its core, MSTY is an engine turning the chaos carried by MSTR stock into cash flow. MSTY doesn’t own MicroStrategy shares directly. Instead, it uses a synthetic covered call strategy, blending U.S. Treasury bills, cash, and short-term call options on MSTR to monetize the stock's underlying volatility. By selling out-of-the-money call options, like the ones you can see in the table below as per its latest holdings, MSTY collects hefty premiums, which it distributes as monthly dividends to investors. These payouts tend to be huge relative to the ETF's NAV previously due to the massive premiums in MSTR's options market. MSTY Holdings (Seeking Alpha) The reason this strategy performs so well with MSTR is that Strategy is no ordinary company. With over 568,000 Bitcoins on its balance sheet, it’s the largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency and a leveraged bet on Bitcoin’s price. With trades and investors from all backgrounds utilizing the stock and its underlying derivatives for different strategies (e.g., holding a levered regulated play on BTC, betting on moonshot call options, or selling the volatility to generate income), MSTR moves more than Bitcoin itself. This volatility fuels rich option premiums, and MSTY captures exactly that (on the selling of the volume front). Defying the Odds: Stronger Dividends Despite Declining Volatility Typically, you’d think a dip in MSTR’s volatility would spell trouble for MSTY’s payouts. After all, lower volatility should mean slimmer option premiums. But surprisingly, MSTY has bucked this trend. As you can see, MSTR's 30-day implied volatility has now declined to around 51%, a notable decline from its 2024 peak of over 150%. MSTR 1M Vol (Koyfin) Yet, MSTY’s dividends have held strong, even growing in recent months. How is this possible? MSTY Dividend History (Seeking Alpha) The answer lies in MSTY’s active management and overall flexibility. The fund doesn’t just blindly sell calls on 100% of its synthetic MSTR exposure. In fact, a few days ago, MSTY adjusted its strategy, writing calls on only about 75% of its holdings, leaving room to capture more upside during MSTR rallies. It also added out-of-the-money long calls at higher strike prices, like $455 and $475, to hedge against parabolic moves. This approach seems to allow MSTY to generate substantial premiums, even in calmer markets. But more importantly, even with the stock's volatility on the decline, MSTR’s option premiums remain very rich, particularly due to the levered nature of MSTR. For instance, YieldMax’s Bitcoin ETF-focused ( YBIT ) yields around 81%, significantly lower than MSTY’s 140%. The difference? MSTR’s unique position as a leveraged Bitcoin play keeps its options pricier and way more active overall. The 140% Yield: Sustainable and Poised to Grow Of course, sustainability is the big question with any high-yield investment, let alone one with such a crazy high yield. Can MSTY’s 140% yield hold up, or is it going to all come crashing down? As I said in my initial article, there is no reason to think that MSTR's high-premium options market is going to fade out any time soon, especially considering that MSTR has both accelerated its BTC accumulation trajectory and actively leveraged up its balance sheet through its two high-yield preferreds ( STRK )( STRF ). In fact, MSTY's yield could very well climb higher under the right conditions. At the end of the day, MSTY’s yield is driven by MSTR’s volatility (even if that hasn't prevented the fund from generating massive premiums, as I was just discussing). So if Bitcoin’s price swings become more violent (up or down), which is not unlikely after several weeks of tight consolidation, we could see premiums move even higher, and thus dividends move higher. In the meantime, even if volatility/premium/dividends were to all unwind, it's still likely that MSTY will be yielding 50%/60%/70%, which would obviously continue to make it a highly attractive investment. The premiums are so high that even a meaningful decline would still make MSTR one of the best yield-farming vehicles. Another engineering beauty is that MSTY’s share price stability enhances its yield potential. Unlike MSTR, which can plummet in a BTC bear market, MSTY’s structure mitigates some downside through its Treasury and cash holdings. If its share price holds steady while dividends grow, the effective yield rises. This dynamic makes MSTY appealing in choppy or range-bound markets, where option premiums shine without the full downside risk of owning MSTR outright. Take the past six months, for example, where you've had MSTY outperform MSTR notably during the latter's mNAV compression. MSTY/MSTR Returns (Koyfin) And yet, MSTY maintains the potential to outperform BTC over the long term, even if it does give some upside away against MSTR due to covered calls capping some of its gains during bigger common stock runs. MSTY/MSTR/BTC Returns (Koyfin) The Risk No investment is without risks, and MSTY is no exception. However, given the nature of the ETF, I believe that the only noteworthy risk is the possibility of a capped upside in a runaway MSTR bull market, as sold calls limit participation in sharp rallies, as I mentioned earlier. If Bitcoin soars to $200,000 and MSTR triples on a multiple expansion-driven enthusiasm, MSTY investors will miss out on some of those gains. Also, a prolonged Bitcoin bear market could slash MSTR’s volatility and stock price, shrinking option premiums and distributions. But still, I find it extremely unlikely that MSTR's volatility will drop to levels that don't produce at least a 30%, 40%, or 50% yield per year, as it will remain a levered BTC play that draws all types of investors who want to bet on each side of the equation that will keep premiums very high. This is the whole \""volatility is vitality\"" argument Mr. Saylor has been trying to explain since MSTR adopted a BTC treasury strategy, after all. Why MSTY Shines for the Bold Look, MSTY isn’t for everyone. You need to buy into the idea that MSTR’s volatility, driven by Saylor’s innovative capital-raising strategies, is a deliberate feature. Once you understand why MSTR is inherently volatile and an ideal playground for market speculators, it becomes clear that an ETF like MSTY, designed to harness this volatility, can deliver exceptionally high, sustainable yields. If that clicks, holding MSTY makes perfect sense.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4791225-why-msty-high-yield-could-fly-even-higher-as-strategy-volatility-potentially-rebounds?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","MSTR|STRK|STRF|MSTY",cryptocompare
2025-05-30T15:10:45.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Willy Woo Issues Critical Bearish Divergence Warning","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Prediction: Willy Woo Issues Critical Bearish Divergence Warning The cryptocurrency market is constantly buzzing with predictions and analysis, and sometimes, a specific timeframe can hold significant weight. According to well-known on-chain analyst Willy Woo, Bitcoin is currently navigating a critical window that could determine its near-term trajectory. His recent commentary has put traders and investors on high alert regarding the potential for a Bitcoin bearish divergence on a key technical chart. The Critical Window for Bitcoin Price Prediction Willy Woo, sharing his insights on X (formerly Twitter), highlighted a specific deadline looming for the flagship cryptocurrency. He stated that Bitcoin has a limited time frame – just two days and sixteen hours from his post – to stage a significant price rally. This isn’t an arbitrary deadline; it’s tied directly to the closing of the weekly price candle, a crucial point for technical analysis. Why is this timeframe so important? The weekly chart provides a higher-level perspective on market trends, often filtering out the noise seen on daily or hourly charts. Technical patterns that appear on the weekly scale are typically considered more significant and potentially indicative of longer-term moves. Woo’s analysis suggests that the current price action relative to other indicators (like momentum oscillators) is setting up a specific pattern that will finalize when the current weekly candle closes. Understanding Bitcoin Bearish Divergence Let’s break down what a bearish divergence means in technical analysis terms. A divergence occurs when the price of an asset moves in one direction, while a technical indicator (like the Relative Strength Index – RSI, or MACD) moves in the opposite direction. A Bitcoin bearish divergence specifically happens when the price makes a higher high, but the indicator makes a lower high. This often signals that the upward momentum is weakening, even though the price is still climbing, and it can be a precursor to a price reversal or a significant downturn. On a weekly chart, such a divergence is particularly noteworthy because it reflects weakening momentum over a longer period. If Bitcoin fails to rally convincingly before the weekly close, the pattern could be confirmed, potentially signaling a shift in market sentiment and price direction. Key points about bearish divergence: Occurs when price makes higher highs, but an indicator makes lower highs. Suggests weakening upward momentum. On a weekly chart, it’s considered a strong signal. Can precede a price correction or extended sideways movement. What Willy Woo Bitcoin Analysis Reveals According to Willy Woo Bitcoin analysis, the risk isn’t just a minor dip, but potentially a ‘prolonged period of sideways or dull market activity’. This suggests that a confirmed weekly bearish divergence might not immediately trigger a sharp crash, but rather lead to a frustrating period for bulls, characterized by: Limited price volatility. Range-bound trading within a relatively tight channel. Lack of strong directional moves. Reduced trading volume and general market apathy. This kind of market environment can be challenging for traders seeking quick profits and may test the patience of long-term holders hoping for a swift continuation of an uptrend. Woo’s warning implies that the current juncture is pivotal – either Bitcoin finds the strength for a breakout rally now, or it risks getting stuck in a less exciting phase. Navigating the Current Bitcoin Market Analysis For those following Bitcoin market analysis , this warning from a respected on-chain analyst provides a crucial data point. While technical analysis should never be the sole basis for investment decisions, understanding potential chart patterns like a bearish divergence is vital for managing risk and setting expectations. Actionable Insights: Watch the Weekly Close: Pay close attention to Bitcoin’s price action leading up to and at the weekly candle close (typically Sunday evening UTC). This is when the potential divergence pattern will either be confirmed or invalidated. Monitor Momentum Indicators: While Woo didn’t specify which indicator, keep an eye on common ones like RSI and MACD on the weekly chart to see if their movement aligns with the price or shows divergence. Consider Risk Management: If the divergence is confirmed, be prepared for the possibility of reduced volatility or downward pressure. This might involve adjusting trading strategies, setting stop-losses, or reducing position sizes. Look for Confirmation: A single technical signal is rarely definitive. Look for confluence with other indicators, on-chain data, or fundamental news before making significant moves. Challenges: Technical analysis is probabilistic, not guaranteed. Divergences can sometimes resolve without a major price move. Unexpected news or events can override technical patterns. The exact timing and magnitude of any subsequent move after a confirmed divergence are uncertain. Implications for the Crypto Market Outlook As Bitcoin often acts as the tide for the broader cryptocurrency space, a period of sideways or dull activity for BTC could have ripple effects across altcoins. The overall Crypto market outlook could become less bullish in the short-to-medium term if Bitcoin loses momentum and enters a consolidation phase following a confirmed weekly bearish divergence. Investors in altcoins should consider how their portfolios might perform in a less volatile or potentially downward-trending Bitcoin environment. Historically, altcoins can sometimes see independent rallies, but often they are highly correlated with Bitcoin’s price movements. Summary: Time is Running Out for a Bitcoin Rally Willy Woo’s recent analysis serves as a timely reminder of the importance of key technical levels and timeframes. The potential for a significant Bitcoin bearish divergence on the weekly chart hangs in the balance, contingent on price action over the next couple of days. If Bitcoin fails to rally and close the week strongly, the market could face a period of stagnation, impacting the overall Crypto market outlook . While not a guarantee of a crash, this warning from a respected voice in Bitcoin market analysis highlights a critical point for observation and potential strategy adjustment. Keeping a close watch on the weekly candle close and combining this technical insight with other forms of analysis will be crucial for navigating the market in the coming days and weeks.

2025-05-30T14:50:38.000Z,"Unstoppable: Why the Current Bitcoin Bull Cycle Appears More Robust","BitcoinWorld Unstoppable: Why the Current Bitcoin Bull Cycle Appears More Robust Are you watching the current Bitcoin (BTC) market action and wondering if something feels different this time around? Many long-time crypto participants are accustomed to the wild, roller-coaster rides of previous Bitcoin bull cycles. However, analysis suggests that the current surge is exhibiting characteristics that make it significantly more robust and perhaps, dare we say, mature. Understanding the Bitcoin Bull Cycle Historically, a Bitcoin bull cycle is characterized by a prolonged period of rising prices, often punctuated by dramatic pumps and equally sharp corrections. These cycles have typically been fueled by retail investor enthusiasm, media hype, and a relatively less mature market infrastructure. While exhilarating, past cycles were also marked by extreme BTC volatility, leading to significant drawdowns that could wipe out a substantial portion of gains in a short time. Think back to 2017 or even early 2021. Prices would skyrocket, sometimes gaining tens of percent in days, only to see pullbacks of 30%, 40%, or even more. This high volatility was often attributed to the market’s relatively small size and lower liquidity, making it susceptible to large orders and sentiment-driven swings. Why is This Cycle Different? Evidence of Reduced Volatility Recent data from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode and analysis highlighted by sources like CoinDesk suggest a notable shift in the market’s behavior. Crypto analyst Omkar Godbole, referencing Glassnode data, pointed out a key metric: realized volatility. Realized volatility measures how much the price of an asset has moved over a specific period. In past bull runs, Bitcoin’s three-month realized volatility often averaged between 80% and 100%. During the current cycle, this figure has averaged below 50%. That’s a significant reduction! Furthermore, TradingView data on 30-day implied volatility also shows a downtrend. Implied volatility is derived from the price of options contracts and reflects market expectations of future price swings. A downtrend here suggests traders are anticipating less drastic price movements ahead compared to previous cycles. Key Volatility Comparison: Past Bull Runs (Realized Volatility): Typically 80% – 100%+ Current Bull Run (Realized Volatility): Averaging below 50% Current Bull Run (Implied Volatility): Demonstrating a downtrend Shallower Drawdowns: A Sign of Stability Beyond just day-to-day swings, the nature of price corrections within the current bull cycle is also different. Glassnode data indicates that the drawdowns from local highs have been significantly shallower compared to previous cycles. In past bull markets, corrections of 30%, 40%, or even 50% were not uncommon during the upward trend. These deep pullbacks could test the resolve of even the most bullish investors. Glassnode’s analysis underscores this difference: “We’ve observed a shallower drawdown profile relative to previous bull markets, with the current cycle drawdowns generally less than -25% from the local high.” This means that while corrections still occur (it’s Bitcoin, after all!), they haven’t been as severe or prolonged as we’ve seen historically within a bull trend. This suggests stronger underlying support and less panic selling during price dips. What’s Driving This Robustness? Institutional Bitcoin and Market Maturity So, what’s behind this apparent shift towards lower volatility and shallower drawdowns? The answer, according to Glassnode and many market observers, lies in the fundamental changes to the crypto market liquidity and the increasing presence of institutional Bitcoin investors. As Bitcoin’s market capitalization has soared past $2 trillion, the sheer size of the market has increased dramatically. This increased size is coupled with significantly deepened liquidity. Liquidity refers to how easily an asset can be bought or sold without significantly affecting its price. More liquidity means that large buy or sell orders have less impact on the price, dampening volatility. The influx of institutional investors, particularly through vehicles like spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., is a major factor contributing to this deepened liquidity and stability. Large financial institutions, asset managers, and corporations trade in much larger volumes than retail investors, but they also often employ more sophisticated, longer-term strategies. Their participation brings: Larger Capital Pools: Institutions deploy significant amounts of capital, adding depth to the order books. Professional Trading Desks: These entities use advanced trading strategies and infrastructure, contributing to more efficient price discovery. Longer-Term Perspective: Many institutions view Bitcoin as a long-term store of value or a strategic allocation, making them less likely to panic sell on minor price dips. Increased Market Structure: The infrastructure built to support institutional trading (prime brokers, custodians, regulated exchanges) adds layers of stability and predictability. This shift from a market dominated by retail traders on potentially less regulated platforms to one significantly influenced by regulated institutional players operating with massive capital pools fundamentally changes the market dynamics. It’s like comparing a small, choppy pond to a large, deep ocean. Implications for Investors: Navigating the More Robust Cycle A more robust Bitcoin market analysis suggests a few key implications for investors: Potentially Lower Risk Profile: While still a volatile asset class compared to traditional assets, reduced intra-cycle volatility and shallower drawdowns *within* the bull trend could mean a less stressful ride for long-term holders. Different Trading Strategies: Strategies focused solely on capturing massive, sudden pumps might be less effective. A focus on accumulation during smaller dips and riding the overall trend might be more appropriate. Increased Credibility: The involvement of institutions and the demonstration of more stable market behavior enhance Bitcoin’s credibility as a legitimate asset class, potentially attracting even more capital over time. Still Requires Caution: It’s crucial to remember that “more robust” does not mean “risk-free.” Bitcoin is still subject to significant price swings, macroeconomic factors, regulatory news, and unexpected events. Drawdowns below 25% are still substantial corrections. Investors should continue to practice sound risk management, diversify their portfolios, and invest only what they can afford to lose. Understanding the evolving market structure, however, can help set realistic expectations and inform investment decisions. Looking Ahead: What Does This Maturity Mean for Bitcoin’s Future? The characteristics observed in the current cycle could be a sign of Bitcoin’s increasing maturity as an asset class. As market infrastructure improves, liquidity deepens, and institutional participation grows, the wild volatility of the past may become less frequent, at least within bull trends. This doesn’t necessarily mean smaller gains overall, but perhaps a different path to those gains – one that is steadier and less prone to extreme, sudden reversals. This could make Bitcoin a more attractive asset for a wider range of investors who were previously deterred by the extreme volatility. While predicting the future is impossible, the data points suggesting a more robust cycle provide compelling evidence that the Bitcoin market is evolving. This evolution is largely positive, indicating growing adoption and a strengthening foundation for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Conclusion: A New Era for Bitcoin? The current Bitcoin bull cycle is indeed exhibiting traits that distinguish it from its predecessors. Lower realized and implied volatility, coupled with shallower drawdowns, paint a picture of a market that is becoming more stable and resilient. This transformation is largely attributable to the significant increase in crypto market liquidity and the growing influence of institutional Bitcoin investors. While the rollercoaster rides of the past hold a certain nostalgic charm for early adopters, the signs of maturity in the current market structure, as highlighted by Bitcoin market analysis, suggest a potentially less volatile, albeit still dynamic, path forward. This increased robustness could be key to attracting even more capital and solidifying Bitcoin’s position in the global financial landscape. Investors should stay informed and adapt their strategies to the evolving nature of this fascinating asset class.

2025-05-30T14:45:14.000Z,"Best Crypto to Buy Now As the Market Dip Offers Cheap Token Prices","The recent dip across crypto markets has played out with a curious twist—there’s no panic this time. Investors seem largely unbothered, and the broader mood leans confident. Bitcoin’s sharp retracement hasn’t changed the macro picture for most institutional analysts, many of whom still view this cycle as incomplete. Rather than seeing red as a reason to flee, many are interpreting the pullback as a buying window. With bullish momentum still present across larger timeframes, this moment feels less like a setback and more like a pause. For those waiting for an opening to enter or re-enter at stronger prices, this correction may be that rare chance to stock up on high-potential tokens before the next leg upward begins. Bitcoin’s Recent Dip - A Breather, Not a Breakdown Bitcoin surged to an all-time high of around $112,000 just over a week ago—only to fall back to $105,000 in a matter of days. That kind of movement might’ve rattled markets in past cycles, but this time the drop is being read more as a “healthy correction” than a warning sign. One possible trigger for this slide was political: the U.S. Court of International Trade’s May 28 ruling challenged President Trump’s sweeping tariffs, suggesting he may have overstepped his authority . The move injected some uncertainty into macro forecasts, especially around inflation and trade. The following day, however, the Court of Appeals allowed the tariffs to continue temporarily under emergency powers—a decision that may have kept the market from tilting further downward. While this back-and-forth could mean short-term choppiness, many analysts see it as beneficial over the longer term. Inflation risks appear contained for now, and that reduces pressure on the Fed ahead of its June 18 rate meeting—an event now seen as pivotal for market direction. Amid this backdrop, predictions for Bitcoin’s price remain bullish. Targets of $120,000 seem plausible to many, while some projections are floating far more ambitious figures, even north of $220,000 during this run. If those estimates hold any weight, then accumulation during this phase could prove a masterstroke. Best Crypto to Buy Now As Projects Are Available At a Discount BTC Bull Every time Bitcoin climbs, BTC Bull makes sure its holders don’t just cheer from the sidelines—they get rewarded. That’s the project’s core mechanic: airdropping tokens to the community when Bitcoin hits predefined price milestones. It flips the usual passive memecoin dynamic by actively tying token distribution to Bitcoin’s momentum, which is exactly what most market watchers still expect to see more of despite the current retracement from $112K to $105K. Beyond that, BTC Bull incorporates a burn mechanism that gradually reduces supply during dips or periods of consolidation. This dual-action model—reward on the way up, reduction on cooldowns—anchors the token’s economy in actual Bitcoin price action. It doesn’t try to be a tech-heavy DeFi tool, and it doesn’t need to. The value proposition is crystal clear: if you believe Bitcoin is heading toward $120K or more, this is a way to amplify that belief with added upside. The project has already undergone a smart contract audit and runs a capped presale with no vesting, making it accessible without long lockups. And in the middle of a market correction, where even solid projects are momentarily discounted, BTC Bull’s model feels more timely than speculative. You’re not buying into noise—you’re buying into a structured, Bitcoin-pegged reward system with deflationary mechanics and timing that aligns neatly with broader macro optimism. Solaxy Not every cross-chain protocol actually solves the problems it claims to. Solaxy takes a more direct route—operating as a Layer 2 that facilitates interaction between Ethereum and Solana without expecting users or developers to compromise on speed, cost, or compatibility. It offers real-time execution pathways between the two chains, letting dApps deploy on one and function seamlessly with liquidity or userbases on the other. No middleware needed, no custom hacks to sync data across ecosystems. Its native token, SOLX, serves multiple roles. It powers the network, unlocks staking at some of the highest APY rates in the space, and gives participants a say in protocol upgrades. Stakers are rewarded not just for locking assets, but for helping secure and stabilize the underlying message-passing infrastructure that makes the dual-chain logic work. The power of $SOLX is increasing! ⚡️🛸42M Raised! 🔥 pic.twitter.com/oolGVbPHvH — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) May 29, 2025 The project has raised upwards of $42 million at the time of writing, which only goes to prove its popularity and growing reach further. Right now, during a brief market cool-off, Solaxy becomes more than a research topic—it becomes an actionable buy. Infrastructure plays like this gain relevance fast when the next leg up starts and Ethereum congestion returns. The same goes for Solana, where speed is high but redundancy is thin. By bridging both ecosystems at Layer 2, Solaxy doesn’t try to beat existing networks—it simply enhances their reach. And with BTC likely to resume its push beyond $112K soon, now might be the least expensive point to gain early exposure to a chain that’s being built for what comes after the rally. MIND of Pepe While other meme tokens recycle frog memes for clicks, MIND of Pepe quietly installs a data layer beneath the chaos. It’s built around an AI model that listens—literally—to crypto Twitter, Telegram, and other social channels in real time, distilling sentiment into actual signals. Traders can tap this stream to identify momentum shifts, breakout chatter, or fading hype—without having to scroll endlessly or rely on lagging indicators. The product layer is gated through the $MIND token. Holding it gives access to real-time dashboards, alerts, and crowd sentiment visualizations. This gives the token actual transactional value—not in a speculative sense, but in a functional, here’s-how-you-use-it way. Instead of selling hopes of a “Pepe ecosystem,” it delivers a sentiment tool traders are already manually cobbling together. MIND just automates it—and makes it smarter over time through AI feedback loops. What makes it especially relevant now is timing. With the market experiencing short-term dislocation after BTC’s $112K-to-$105K pullback, directional confidence is thinner, but attention remains sky-high. Tools that clarify market psychology become sharper when prices are volatile. So while others might be refreshing charts, MIND users can check where the next wave of attention is heading. And with prices temporarily softer across the board, getting access to that insight at a discount is a move worth considering. Snorter Snorter isn’t trying to reinvent token sniping—it’s trying to refine it. Built as a Telegram-based trading bot, the project focuses on giving users instant access to Solana-based tokens, allowing them to execute trades with fewer steps, less delay, and a cleaner interface. Once activated, the bot enables real-time token discovery, direct trade execution, and access to launch data within the Telegram app itself. That’s where it cuts through noise: no need for browser extensions, third-party aggregators, or gas fee estimators. Its core value lies in its simplicity. Snorter is designed to function with minimal configuration, offering both beginners and active traders a set of streamlined features including wallet tracking, newly launched token alerts, and preconfigured snipe setups. Because it's embedded inside Telegram, there's no separate login or dashboard overhead—just a focused suite of tools that do one thing well: get trades done quickly. During high-momentum cycles, trading bots often suffer from overload or require complex scripts to operate efficiently. Snorter skips that. It appeals to those looking to react in seconds instead of minutes, especially when Solana tokens launch and volatility spikes immediately. Even as a brand new entrant to the presale space, the project has been covered by several popular crypto news outlets and YouTube channels like 99Bitcoins . With the market currently in a short correction phase, projects like Snorter become highly relevant—offering a technical edge at a time when precision matters. Traders using this tool aren't gambling on market direction—they’re equipping themselves for better execution when the momentum returns. And with presale access still live, entry comes before full rollout pricing kicks in. SUBBD SUBBD approaches the creator economy from a practical angle: remove platform restrictions, and let creators monetize their audience on-chain without intermediaries taking a cut. The project offers an ecosystem where content creators can build token-gated experiences, launch subscriptions, and create monetized chatrooms using the $SUBBD token—all hosted in a decentralized environment. The value is in the structure. Instead of relying on centralized platforms like Patreon or YouTube, creators using SUBBD can issue private content directly to holders, configure time-based access, or even push token-based voting mechanisms that influence their content roadmap. For followers, this means more transparency, direct access, and clearer support mechanics. For creators, it’s ownership of their audience relationships and revenue streams, without being bound to platform policies. Beyond the mechanics, SUBBD also offers a toolkit for NFT integration, enabling digital collectibles to serve both as content unlocks and membership badges. This connects with existing trends in creator monetization but shifts the infrastructure toward blockchain, where creators retain control. As platforms continue to crack down or restrict monetization methods, this autonomy becomes a differentiator. With markets dipping temporarily and BTC pulling back from $112K, investor attention often shifts toward utility-based early-stage tokens. SUBBD fits that window: not priced for hype, but for infrastructure value. It’s built for a segment—creators and their audiences—that already exists and is eager for alternatives. The token’s current presale pricing, available during a broader correction, might be the most accessible point to enter before adoption drives cost upward. Conclusion This market pullback may look like a setback on the charts, but for strategic investors, it’s presenting rare entry points. With broader sentiment still skewing bullish and structural targets for Bitcoin pushing higher, the conditions favor accumulation. The projects discussed above offer actual utility and early-stage value—making them well worth considering while prices remain suppressed.

2025-05-30T14:40:57.000Z,"AI Power Consumption: Shocking Projections Show AI Energy Use Could Soon Overtake Bitcoin Mining","BitcoinWorld AI Power Consumption: Shocking Projections Show AI Energy Use Could Soon Overtake Bitcoin Mining In the rapidly evolving digital landscape, two technologies often dominate headlines: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Both are revolutionary, pushing the boundaries of computation and challenging traditional systems. However, their significant growth brings a crucial conversation to the forefront: their energy footprint. Are you aware of the potential energy demands these technologies place on our planet? Understanding the Energy Landscape: AI Power Consumption vs. Bitcoin Energy Consumption For years, the energy required for Bitcoin mining has been a hot topic, drawing criticism and driving innovation within the crypto space. Now, a new projection suggests that the energy demands of AI could soon rival, or even surpass, that of Bitcoin. According to a projection highlighted by Digital Today, and based on analysis by Alex de Vries-Gao, a PhD candidate at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, AI power consumption is on track to exceed Bitcoin energy consumption by the end of 2025. This isn’t just a minor increase; the scale is significant. Let’s break down what this projection means: Current AI Energy Use: AI already accounts for a substantial portion of electricity consumed by data centers, estimated to be up to 20%. Projected AI Growth: The estimate suggests that AI-related power demand could reach 23 gigawatts (GW) by the close of 2025. Putting it in Perspective: 23 GW is roughly equivalent to the total electricity consumption of an entire country, like the United Kingdom. This comparison isn’t about declaring one technology ‘better’ or ‘worse’ from an energy standpoint, but rather understanding the scale of energy required to power these increasingly integral parts of our digital future. Both have unique energy profiles driven by their underlying mechanisms. Why Do These Technologies Demand So Much Energy? To grasp the projection, we need to look at the core processes driving the energy use in each domain. Bitcoin Energy Consumption: The Proof-of-Work Engine Bitcoin’s energy use is primarily tied to its security mechanism, known as Proof-of-Work (PoW). Here’s the simple breakdown: Mining Process: Miners use powerful computers (ASICs) to solve complex mathematical puzzles. Securing the Network: The first miner to solve the puzzle gets to add the next block of transactions to the blockchain and is rewarded with new Bitcoin. Competition Drives Energy: The difficulty of these puzzles adjusts based on the total computing power (hash rate) on the network. More miners mean more competition, requiring more powerful hardware and, consequently, more electricity to solve the puzzles and earn rewards. Decentralization and Security: This energy expenditure is fundamental to Bitcoin’s decentralized security, making it incredibly difficult and expensive for any single entity to attack or control the network. The debate around Bitcoin’s energy use often centers on its environmental impact, though proponents argue that a significant and growing portion of mining is powered by renewable energy sources, often utilizing stranded or otherwise unused energy. AI Power Consumption: Training, Inference, and Data Centers AI’s energy demands stem from the computational intensity of its processes, particularly within massive Data center power infrastructures. Training Models: Developing large, complex AI models (like large language models) requires immense computational power over extended periods. This involves feeding vast datasets into algorithms running on specialized hardware, primarily high-performance GPUs (Graphics Processing Units). This is the most energy-intensive phase. Inference: Once trained, running these models to perform tasks (like generating text, recognizing images, or making predictions) is called inference. While less energy-intensive than training per task, the sheer volume of AI inferences performed globally is rapidly increasing, contributing significantly to overall AI power consumption . Hardware Requirements: AI workloads necessitate powerful processors (GPUs, TPUs, etc.) that consume considerable electricity and also require extensive cooling systems, further increasing the energy footprint of the data centers housing them. Data Center Infrastructure: The physical data centers themselves, housing servers, networking equipment, and cooling systems, are inherently large consumers of electricity, regardless of the specific tasks being run. AI workloads amplify this consumption. The explosive growth in AI capabilities and adoption means more models are being trained, and more inferences are being performed across countless applications, directly correlating to a surge in Energy use of AI . AI vs Bitcoin Power: A Closer Look at the Comparison Comparing AI vs Bitcoin power isn’t straightforward, as they serve different purposes and have different energy profiles. However, the projection highlights a potential shift in the narrative around technology’s energy impact. Here are some key comparison points: Driver of Consumption: Bitcoin’s energy use is driven by securing a decentralized monetary network through competitive computation (PoW). AI’s energy use is driven by the computational complexity of training and running intelligent models for a vast array of applications (from search engines to scientific research). Growth Trajectory: Bitcoin’s energy consumption growth is somewhat tied to price and network security needs. AI’s energy consumption is growing rapidly due to advancements in model size, complexity, and widespread deployment across industries. Location of Consumption: Bitcoin mining is distributed globally, often seeking out the cheapest energy sources, including renewables. AI power consumption is heavily concentrated in large data centers, often located near infrastructure hubs. Hardware: Bitcoin primarily uses specialized ASICs. AI primarily uses high-end GPUs and other accelerators. Both require significant power. The projection that AI power consumption could exceed Bitcoin energy consumption by 2025 underscores the fact that all computationally intensive technologies have an energy cost. As AI becomes more integrated into daily life and business, its cumulative energy demand grows exponentially. What Are the Challenges and Implications? The potential for AI’s energy footprint to grow so rapidly presents several challenges: Environmental Impact: Increased energy demand, especially if sourced from fossil fuels, contributes to carbon emissions and climate change. This is a shared challenge for both AI and Bitcoin. Infrastructure Strain: A rapid surge in demand can strain existing power grids, potentially leading to increased costs or reliability issues. Measurement and Transparency: Accurately measuring the total energy consumption of AI across various applications and data centers is complex. Bitcoin’s network hash rate provides a more direct (though still debated) proxy for energy use. Sustainability Efforts: Both sectors face pressure to move towards more sustainable energy sources. While Bitcoin mining has shown a trend towards renewables, the scale and speed of AI deployment require significant investment in green data center infrastructure. Understanding the scale of Data center power required for AI is crucial for planning future energy infrastructure and sustainability initiatives. Actionable Insights and the Path Forward Addressing the energy demands of advanced technologies like AI and Bitcoin requires multi-faceted approaches: For the AI Sector: Algorithm and Hardware Efficiency: Develop more energy-efficient AI algorithms and specialized hardware that can perform computations with less electricity. Optimizing Inference: Focus on optimizing AI models for inference, as this will constitute a larger share of energy use as AI deployment scales. Green Data Centers: Invest heavily in building and powering data centers with renewable energy sources (solar, wind, hydro). Improve cooling efficiency. Research and Transparency: Increase research into the actual energy footprint of different AI models and applications and promote transparency in reporting energy use. For the Bitcoin Sector: Continue Renewable Energy Adoption: Maintain and accelerate the trend of sourcing energy from renewables, particularly utilizing otherwise wasted energy. Improve Mining Efficiency: Develop more energy-efficient mining hardware (ASICs). Explore Alternatives (where applicable): While Bitcoin is unlikely to change its core PoW mechanism due to its security implications, other cryptocurrencies are exploring or utilizing less energy-intensive consensus mechanisms like Proof-of-Stake (PoS). The conversation around AI vs Bitcoin power consumption highlights a broader challenge for the digital age: how to balance technological advancement with environmental responsibility. Both fields have the potential to drive innovation in sustainable energy solutions. Concluding Thoughts: Navigating the Energy Future of Tech The projection that AI power consumption could soon exceed Bitcoin energy consumption serves as a powerful reminder that energy is the fundamental currency of computation. As AI systems become more sophisticated and ubiquitous, their energy demands will naturally increase. This isn’t necessarily a condemnation of AI, but rather a call to action for developers, companies, and policymakers to prioritize energy efficiency and renewable sources in the design and deployment of AI technologies and the data centers that power them. While the debate around Bitcoin energy consumption will likely continue, the emergence of AI as a potentially larger energy consumer shifts the spotlight and underscores the need for a holistic approach to the energy footprint of all advanced computing. The future of both AI and Bitcoin, and indeed much of our digital infrastructure, depends on finding sustainable ways to meet their growing Energy use of AI and other computational demands.

2025-05-30T14:33:08.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Slides Below $106,000, Is A Correction Looming?","Bitcoin (BTC) registered a sharp decline on Thursday, falling over 2% and going below $106,000. Some analysts have warned of an impending correction, while others believe overall sentiment around the flagship cryptocurrency will remain positive as long as it remains above $100,000. BTC is down nearly 3% over the past 24 hours, trading around $105,662. Cantor Fitzgerald Planning Bitcoin Fund Cantor Fitzgerald Asset Management is launching a new fund combining Bitcoin exposure with downside protection tied to the price of gold. The fund, called the Cantor Fitzgerald Gold Protected Bitcoin Fund, L.P., will be the asset management company’s first investment product focused on Bitcoin. The fund is structured as a five-year vehicle and will give investors complete upside participation in Bitcoin while providing 1-to-1 protection against losses based on the price of gold. Cantor Fitzgerald’s hybrid approach addresses investor concerns regarding Bitcoin’s volatility. By linking the fund with the price of gold, Cantor Fitzgerald is positioning it as a hedging strategy, bridging traditional safe-haven assets with high-growth digital assets. The firm recently announced a partnership with Tether, Bitfinex, and SoftBank to launch a $3 billion Bitcoin investment firm called 21 Capital. China Imposes Fresh Crypto Ban China has imposed a sweeping new ban prohibiting the trading, mining, and individual ownership of cryptocurrencies and extended its scope to cover digital assets, including Bitcoin . The move is a significant escalation in China’s hardline approach to crypto and reaffirms its commitment to centralized financial control and promotion of the state-backed digital yuan. China’s decision had an immediate impact on crypto, with Bitcoin registering a sharp decline. Altcoins, especially ones sensitive to regulatory shifts, registered even greater volatility. The ban has several implications for crypto. By outlawing private crypto holdings, Beijing has tightened its grip on financial flows, potentially accelerating the adoption of the digital yuan. The ban could also lead to greater decentralization in crypto across Asia as users and investors look for jurisdictions with favorable policies. Coinsilium Adds To Bitcoin Holdings Coinsilium, a company specializing in Web3 investments and advisory services, has issued an update on its Bitcoin treasury. The firm stated it had purchased 5.0021 BTC at an average price of £82,165.49 ($110,424.26) through its Gibraltar subsidiary, Forza! The acquisition takes the company’s Bitcoin holdings to 10.0021 BTC , which includes the recent transfer of 5 Bitcoin from Coinsilium’s reserves. The firm is in the middle of developing a digital assets treasury policy to focus on the strategic management of its Bitcoin holdings. The policy will be adopted upon completion by Forza!, which is tasked with implementing Coinsilium’s Bitcoin-focused treasury operations. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has slipped below the crucial $106,000 level, indicating a deeper correction could be on the cards. The flagship cryptocurrency registered a steep decline on Thursday, falling over 2% to $105,662. Analysts have warned that if BTC continues its correction, it could revisit the psychologically important $100,000 mark. A drop below this level could mark the return of bearish sentiment. Alternatively, if BTC regains momentum, it could retest $110,000. A break above this level could see a move towards $120,000. Some analysts have called BTC’s recent price action a “healthy pause” that will help the market digest recent gains. They also stated that the recent pullback cannot be interpreted as a bearish signal. Onchain options protocol founder Nick Forster stated, “While the recent surge to over $111,000 was notable, the current price action suggests a phase of consolidation rather than an imminent breakout.” According to Forster, a consolidation phase could be healthy before BTC resumes its uptrend, giving the flagship cryptocurrency time to gear up for the next phase of its price action. However, more conservative analysts believe BTC could slip to $100,000 after falling below a key level, arguing that buyers are showing signs of slowing down. They also highlighted a decline in Strategy’s purchase volume, with the firm acquiring 4020 BTC between May 19 and May 25. Some analysts believe there is a strong correlation between Strategy’s Bitcoin purchases and its price. However, others argue the firm represents only a fraction of the total Bitcoin trading volume. “MicroStrategy’s purchases represented only a fraction of total Bitcoin trading volume, with a median average weekly result of 3.3%.” BTC began the previous week in the red, dropping to an intraday low of $102,135 before recovering to settle at $105,527, ultimately registering a decline of almost 1%. The price recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.21% to $106,854. Bullish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as BTC rose nearly 3% to cross $109,000 and settle at $109,603. BTC raced to a new all-time high on Thursday, reaching $111,970 before registering a marginal decline and settling at $111,589. However, markets turned bearish on Friday, and BTC fell almost 4%, slipping below $110,000 and settling at $107,356. Source: TradingView BTC recovered over the weekend, rising 0.46% on Saturday and 1.16% on Sunday to reclaim $109,000 and settle at $109,103. Buyers retained control on Monday as the price registered a marginal increase and moved to $109,453. However, BTC lost momentum on Tuesday, falling 0.46% to $108,954. The price continued dropping on Wednesday, falling 1.03% to $107,834. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC fell over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,662. The current session sees BTC marginally down as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control. If BTC continues its downtrend, it could drop to $100,000. A break below this level will confirm the return of bearish sentiment. On the other hand, if buyers regain control, the price could rise to $110,000.

2025-05-30T14:30:23.000Z,"Paris Saint-Germain Unveils Bitcoin Treasury Before Final","PSG's Crypto Bet: Why the Club Bet the House on Bitcoin While the City of Light buzzes with excitement ahead of the Champions League Final, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) has hijacked the headlines off the pitch. In a gesture as bold as a late bicycle kick, the French football behemoth has revealed it possesses a significant Bitcoin coffers making news mere days before the biggest match of the year. The news broke early on Friday morning when PSG official sources made a release that stunned both the sporting and the crypto communities. ”We've been proud for a long time to be pioneers,” said PSG financial director Jean-Claude Blanc at a crowded press conference that included both sporting writers and crypto celebrities. ”Today, we confirm that Bitcoin will be included in our gamebook.”. For PSG, however, this is not just a headline generator. The team has amassed some 120 BTC — worth approximately $8.2 million at current prices—over the past two seasons quietly. According to insiders, the decision was many months in the making, with PSG's coffers keeping an eye on both the crypto universe and the shifting nature of European football economies. While other clubs have experimented with crypto assets through sponsorships or NFT drops, PSG's move is different. This is a balance sheet move, not marketing. ”We see Bitcoin as a long-term store of value and a hedge against volatility in the euro, especially as so many of our transfers and agreements cross borders,” Blanc said, his voice echoing in Parc des Princes' marble corridors. Football is an international business, and no clubs know it better than PSG. On an annual basis, the club makes millions of dollars worth of transactions, remitting South American superstars or negotiating with agents in London, Madrid, or Doha. Legacy banking rails are uncompetitive and expensive—sometimes charging millions of dollars in FX fees and time. That's where Bitcoin enters the picture. PSG crunched numbers on a theoretical €100 million transfer, making a mock settlement with BTC. The payoff? As much as €2 million in fee savings alone. ”It's enough to support a youth academy or cover a rising star's salary for a year,” stated an unnamed club executive. ”It's not only savvy finance — it's a competitive advantage.” Fan Reactions, $PSG Token Buzz, and What's Next for Football PSG's bravery is already resonating throughout football. Though American franchises like the Sacramento Kings have experimented, no European club of PSG's caliber has accounted for Bitcoin on its balance sheet at least not yet. Other clubs are poised in the wings, and whispers of ”crypto treasuries” are spoken in boardrooms from Turin to Manchester. Fan-token analysts are also buzzing. The $PSG fan token, which struggled through most of the season, saw 30% volume growth after the news of Bitcoin. ”This could be the start of a new era for fan interaction,” Twitter user wrote. ”If PSG's crypto bet is successful on the field, watch for a wave of copycats.” With the Champions League Final on the horizon, PSG's Bitcoin gamble is more than a money note — it's a declaration about football's future. Will others imitate? Will watchdogs notice? And above all, will PSG's crypto bravado be repaid in silverware? For now, the city waits with bated breath, the fans chant, and deep in the club's digital vaults, 120 BTC silently proclaim a new era for the beautiful game.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9385/paris-saint-germain-unveils-bitcoin-treasury-before-final,"BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-05-30T14:30:22.000Z,"Bitcoin at Risk of Breakdown if Major Support Level Fails, Says Trader Justin Bennett – Here Are His Targets","Cryptocurrency analyst and trader Justin Bennett is warning that Bitcoin ( BTC ) faces the risk of correcting by double-digit percentage points if a key support level crumbles. In a new strategy session, Bennett tells 63,300 subscribers of the Daily Price Action YouTube channel that Bitcoin is showing signs of a potential bearish reversal. According to Bennett, the support “level to watch” for Bitcoin is $106,000. On how low Bitcoin could go if the $106,000 support level breaks, Bennett says, “As far as targets go, if we do get that confirmed breakdown… …we do have this pocket back here that looks appealing. Now we have these lows around $101,000. That could be a first target… …if we do get that reversal, my guess is we probably see the market come down here toward $100,000 and just below that to tag this area and fill that imbalance… …so if the market gets below $106,000, you’ve got to look at this in a sequential order, meaning that you’re looking at these lows first. First target down here, second target down there, around $97,000 or so. And then potentially a third target down there around $92,000. So that’s how I’m looking at this here, if we do get that sustained break below $106,000.” According to Bennett, Bitcoin’s outlook could turn bullish if it approaches the all-time high levels. “If we see the market rally from here [around $106,500], take out this level [above $109,000], start to close up here and press on this level, then that would invalidate any idea of a breakdown. If the market reclaims $110,000 on the daily chart, then that would invalidate that move lower…” Bitcoin is trading at $107,560 at time of writing, around 4% below the all-time high of slightly under $112,000.

2025-05-30T14:25:25.000Z,"UK’s Reform Party puts crypto tax cuts and Bitcoin reserve plan on its campaign agenda","The United Kingdom political party Reform UK wants to make cryptocurrency one of its priorities to attract young voters. Party chairman Zia Yusuf disclosed this in a recent op-ed, noting that the party intends to make the UK a crypto powerhouse. The move comes amid the largely positive momentum for the crypto industry over the past year due to President Donald Trump’s support for the sector. Trump, who embraced crypto in the lead-up to his election as president, saw massive support from the industry, which contributed to his victory, and Reform is now trying to replicate that in the UK. According to Yusuf , there is a need to reignite innovation efforts in the UK, and the Reform Party intends to achieve this when its leader, Nigel Farage, becomes prime minister. He said: “For too long, British innovation has been stifled, young people have been denied opportunity, our startup community has been left to rot, and our financial services sector has been smothered. As Prime Minister, Nigel Farage will jump-start and reboot the British economy.” As part of its efforts to prioritize crypto, the party has now published its Cryptoassets and Digital Finance Bill to address crypto regulation in the country. Yusuf said the proposed legislation would make the UK a crypto and digital finance hub with London at the center of it. With the party embracing crypto, it hopes to attract younger voters, who make up 25% of the seven million people who own crypto in the UK. However, Reform UK’s ambitions are quite lofty given that it only controls five seats in the UK House of Commons, far below the 403 seats held by Labour and 120 seats belonging to Conservatives. Proposed legislation to reduce the tax burden on crypto investors The Reform UK chairman explained some key issues its proposed Crypto Bill addresses. These include reducing the capital gains on crypto assets to 10%, far below the maximum 24% current rate, a move meant to address the tax burden for crypto holders. Yusuf stated that simplifying the tax system and lowering rates could boost compliance and encourage more crypto investors to choose the UK. Thus, it could lead to higher revenue. He said: “This will in turn, drive a big boost in tax revenue – repeating the winning formula that once made the City the global capital of finance. This kind of bespoke, competitive tax rate would have been impossible under EU law.” Beyond the tax benefits, the bill will provide regulatory clarity by introducing a 2-year regulatory sandbox for blockchain-focused firms. This move is expected to make the UK more attractive for firms while maintaining regulatory protections. Interestingly, the bill wants to end debanking individuals and corporate entities due to crypto transactions. Yusuf said the Reform Party will make it illegal for banks to close users’ accounts simply because they transact using crypto. This represents a particularly sore point for the party, given that its leader, Farage, was debanked in 2023. However, the UK government has already started trying to regulate the industry and recently proposed safe harbor rules for crypto assets. Reform Party to start accepting crypto donations Perhaps in a move to show its pro-crypto commitment, Farage has announced that Reform will start accepting crypto donations from all eligible donors. He shared this news while speaking at the Bitcoin Conference 2025, an event where Trump also spoke last year. Reform UK became Europe’s first major political party to accept crypto donations with the move. This shows the massive gap between crypto adoption in Europe and the US, where the two major parties already accept crypto. Meanwhile, Reform will use crypto payments provider Radom to process donations, which would accept major crypto assets, including Bitcoin and other major altcoins. Radom acknowledged this in its blog post, noting that it is a good sign for crypto adoption in Europe. Interestingly, Farage also endorsed the creation of a strategic Bitcoin Reserve by the Bank of England, noting that he would campaign for this. This is similar to Trump’s campaign promises of creating a Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Assets Stockpile when he becomes president. Unsurprisingly, many in the crypto community have praised this move, particularly because the current Labour-led government has said it would not consider Bitcoin a reserve asset. Bitcoin Policy UK executive Freddie New said that the advocacy group is ready to engage with the party and criticized the UK government for refusing to recognize Bitcoin as a reserve asset.

2025-05-30T14:15:58.000Z,"BTC Price Pulls Back After Recent ATH Despite New Bitcoin Reserve Announcements: Weekly Recap","It was somewhat expected that, after weeks and weeks of charting gains and a recent all-time high, bitcoin’s price would eventually retrace, which transpired in the past few days. But first, let’s go back to the historic events of last week when the primary cryptocurrency, following four months filled mostly with struggles due to global economic uncertainty, broke its January 2025 all-time high and set a new one at almost $112,000 on Pizza Day (May 22). Since then, though, the asset has been unable to maintain its recent run. At first, it was the latest tariffs recommended by US President Trump, this time solely against the EU, that pushed BTC south by several grand. Although Trump later suspended the tariffs for over a month, this failed to impact the cryptocurrency’s price to a large extent. It jumped to over $110,000 on a couple of occasions during the business week, but to no avail as each attempt was met with immediate resistance and rejection. The past 24 hours have been particularly painful, as BTC was stopped once again at $109,000 and drove south to a weekly low of under $105,000. There are some speculations within the community that this was intentionally done to liquidate a certain high-end trader, but the fact is that bitcoin’s price has slumped by over 2% on a weekly scale, even though it has recovered some ground to $105,500 as of press time. Still, its price decline is a lot less painful than those of DOGE, SOL, ADA, SUI, LINK, and AVAX. The meme coin leads this adverse trend with a substantial 8% weekly drop.

2025-05-30T14:15:10.000Z,"Donald Trump’s $2.5 Billion Bitcoin Play A Distraction? Early Buyers Are Snapping Up This 100x Token","While Donald Trump’s mammoth Bitcoin (BTC) investment rattles headlines and critics, another crypto movement is gathering unstoppable momentum as a meme-powered token that early buyers believe is the real 100x opportunity. Bitcoin (BTC) Soars As Trump Bets Big: But What’s The Real Game? Donald Trump’s Trump Media & Technology Group just announced plans to raise $2.5 billion, splitting the funding between $1.5 billion in stock sales and $1 billion in convertible notes. The purpose is to build one of the largest Bitcoin (BTC) treasuries in corporate America. This announcement immediately sent Bitcoin (BTC) rocketing, sparking bullish cheers from investors. It also signaled Donald Trump’s broader pro-crypto agenda ahead of his second-term campaign. He signed an executive order establishing a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, an unprecedented move to solidify Bitcoin (BTC) as part of the nation’s assets. Yet the timing raises eyebrows. Alongside the Bitcoin (BTC) buy-in, Donald Trump launched his personal Official Trump (TRUMP) token, blurring ethical boundaries between public service and private gain. Critics warn of conflicts of interest, while supporters hail it as a milestone in decentralization.

2025-05-30T14:15:00.000Z,"What’s Behind the Massive Drop in Layer 2s, GameFi, and Meme Tokens?","Crypto markets tumble as Bitcoin drops from $111K to $105K, dragging altcoins down hard. Layer 2 and gaming tokens lead declines with double-digit losses across timeframes. Profit-taking, macro risks, and FTX repayments drive a broad crypto market correction. An overall selloff has affected the cryptocurrency market, with Layer 2 tokens, gaming projects, and meme coins experiencing sharp drops across multiple timeframes. The correction comes as Bitcoin retreated from its recent high of above $111,000 to current levels around $105,000. This has triggered weakness throughout the altcoin sectors. Layer 2 scaling solutions have been particularly hard hit, with the sector’s combined market capitalization falling 7.34% to $13.54 billion. Stacks (STX) leads the decline with a 19.95% drop over seven days, trading at $0.7861. Optimism (OP) follows closely with a 14.88% weekly decline to $0.6883, while Arbitrum (ARB) has fallen 13.63% to $0.3709. The weakness extends across different timeframes, with most Layer 2 tokens showing red across 24-hour, weekly, and longer periods.

After a 5% weekly gain, SOL is on track for a breakout above $200—a top DeFi token to watch. Meanwhile, the TRON coin is on track to flip December’s all-time high, while Unilabs (UNIL) is listed among the best AI coins to buy now. Basking in the spotlight, UNIL is a revolutionary AI launchpad for digital assets, boasting over $30 million in AUM (assets under management) as of Q2 2025. Its integration of artificial intelligence and diverse fund options across RWA, BTC, Mining and AI makes it a new DeFi project worth keeping on the radar. Moreover, it is in its early stages, with the presale presenting an opportunity to become early adopters—one of the best AI coins to buy now. Solana Price Target a Jump Above $200 The Solana price skyrocketed 5% in the past week, pushing it above $175. With bulls surging forward with renewed confidence, a breakout above the 30-day high of $187 could play out in the coming days. Flipping this level could spark a rally toward $200—crypto analyst LosKruptos shares a similar sentiment. CoinsCapture, filled with optimism, predicts the Solana price could soar as high as $1,000 this year. At the same time, moving averages suggest now might be a great time to stockpile more at the current Solana price, notably the 9-HMA and 20-VWMA. Although SOL is a good crypto to buy, savvy investors stacking up more UNIL tokens at $0.0051 is a testimony to the latter’s higher upside potential, hailed as one of the best AI coins to buy now. TRON Price Prepares to Surpass 2024 ATH TRX is among the top 10 cryptocurrencies, with the TRON price surging ahead with a 12% monthly gain. It has skyrocketed over 20% in the past three months, having a great start to the year. However, its performance in Q4 2024 remains its best yet—a new ATH of $0.44 in December. Despite being down over 35% from its December high, a new peak is around the corner, supported by the neutral 14-day RSI data and Awesome Oscillator. Meanwhile, top analysts have been throwing out bullish TRON price predictions, highlighting its potential. John Olavarria hints at the TRON price reaching $1 this cycle, while TheCurrencyA has an ambitious forecast of $3.55. While it is poised for a significant leap, UNIL’s small market size means it has plenty of room to run and is on experts’ lists of the best AI coins to buy now, not to mention it is more pocket-friendly. Unilabs (UNIL): A New DeFi Protocol and One of the Best AI Coins to Buy Now Unilabs’ (UNIL) blend of traditional and decentralized finance and integration of artificial intelligence has been the talk of the crypto community. Unlike conventional asset managers, it will be a platform for digital assets backed by AI. Aiming to democratize access to institutional-grade investment analytics and portfolio management tools, this protocol will empower retail and institutional investors to navigate the dynamic DeFi landscape. Retailers will enjoy next-level transparency and unparalleled access to ventures once reserved for institutional players, positioning them for massive return on investment. A notable key feature of the protocol includes a Stablecoin Savings Account—users can deposit into its secure fiat-pegged pools (USDT and USDC) and earn. Meanwhile, its Flash Loan Accelerator allows users to borrow large amounts of capital instantly without collateral. At the heart of the ecosystem will be the UNIL token, listed among the best AI coins to buy now and more pocket-friendly than the current TRON price and Solana price. Closing Thoughts Given the significant upside and historical outperformance of ICOs, the UNIL token might be one of the best AI coins to buy now. Despite the bullish Solana price predictions and the rising TRON price, it is more attractive, priced at $0.0051 in the second stage of the presale. Surpassing $1.3 million in funding in record time, it is a new DeFi project to watch.

2025-05-30T14:14:32.000Z,"Solana (SOL) Price Heading to the Crucial Range—Will it Drop to $150 or Rebound to $180?","The post Solana (SOL) Price Heading to the Crucial Range—Will it Drop to $150 or Rebound to $180? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto markets are consolidating ahead of the $5 billion liquidity entering the space, as FTX is set to distribute stablecoins to their creditors. While the Bitcoin price slipped below $105,000, the Solana price also hit the lows close to $160. The price continues to face more upward pressure, which could drag the levels below the range. With this, the price has reached a crucial price range; hence, a major pullback could follow if the bears continue to exert more pressure. Now, the question arises whether the SOL price is reversing the trend of forming higher highs and lows. The long-term price action of Solana remains under bearish action, regardless of the short-term price action. Unfortunately, the price is facing a pullback from the crucial resistance, which suggests the growing dominance of the bears. Meanwhile, the technicals have also turned against the bulls, hinting towards the price plunging towards the local support soon. The SOL price is trading within a descending expanding channel, and the price is facing rejection after testing the upper resistance. The RSI has displayed a bearish divergence, while the CMF remains below 0. This hints towards the existence of the bearish dominance since the start of the year, regardless of the interim bullish action. If the upward pressure escalates, the price is feared to drop heavily to the local support at $151.97. Moreover. The price is plunging after hitting the 50-day weekly MA just below $170, which raises huge concerns. After hitting the new highs above $3.5 trillion, the crypto markets seem to be consolidating for a while as Bitcoin faces some upward pressure. Therefore, a bearish weekly close could validate a fresh bearish action, pushing the Solana (SOL) price towards lower support, probably close to $130. Hence, the upcoming monthly close could be extremely important for the SOL price and the entire crypto market.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/solana-sol-price-heading-to-the-crucial-range-will-it-drop-to-150-or-rebound-to-180/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|SOL|TRADING","Price Analysis|Altcoins",cryptocompare
2025-05-30T14:10:26.000Z,"Bitcoin Perpetual Futures: Unveiling Key Long-Short Ratio Insights","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Perpetual Futures: Unveiling Key Long-Short Ratio Insights Hey there, crypto enthusiasts! Keeping a pulse on the market is crucial, and one powerful tool in a trader’s arsenal is the long-short ratio for BTC perpetual futures . This metric gives us a snapshot of the prevailing sentiment among traders on derivatives exchanges. Today, we’re diving into the data from the past 24 hours to see where traders are leaning. Are they betting on Bitcoin’s price going up (long) or down (short)? Let’s break down the numbers and see what they might tell us about the current market sentiment . What Exactly is the Long-Short Ratio? Before we look at the data, let’s quickly clarify what the long-short ratio represents. In simple terms, it’s the ratio of the total number of long positions to the total number of short positions open on a particular exchange or across multiple exchanges for a specific asset, like BTC perpetual futures . Perpetual futures contracts are popular in crypto trading because they don’t have an expiry date, unlike traditional futures. A ratio above 1 suggests more traders are holding long positions than short positions, indicating a generally bullish sentiment. A ratio below 1 suggests more traders are holding short positions, indicating a generally bearish sentiment. A ratio close to 1 suggests a relatively balanced sentiment. This ratio is a valuable piece of data for anyone involved in Bitcoin analysis and derivatives trading. Why Does This Ratio Matter for Crypto Trading? Understanding the long-short ratio is vital for several reasons: Gauging Market Sentiment: It provides a direct look into whether the crowd is predominantly bullish or bearish on BTC perpetual futures . This is a key indicator of market sentiment . Identifying Potential Reversals: Sometimes, extreme ratios can signal potential price reversals. For example, an excessively high long ratio might indicate an overheated market ripe for a correction as crowded long positions get liquidated. Informing Trading Strategies: Traders use this data alongside other technical and fundamental analysis to make informed decisions about opening or closing positions. It’s not a standalone predictor, but it’s a significant puzzle piece in the complex world of crypto trading . Analyzing the Latest 24-Hour BTC Perpetual Futures Data Let’s get straight to the numbers for BTC perpetual futures over the last 24 hours: Total Across Sampled Exchanges: Long Positions: 48.57% Short Positions: 51.43% This overall figure shows a slight lean towards short positions globally across the exchanges included in this aggregation. The long-short ratio here is just under 1 (approximately 0.94), indicating a marginally bearish bias in aggregate market sentiment . How Do Top Exchanges Compare in Long-Short Ratios? Looking at individual exchanges gives us a more granular view. Here are the figures for three major platforms known for their high volume in BTC perpetual futures : Exchange Long % Short % Long-Short Ratio Binance 48.63% 51.37% ~0.95 Bybit 47.20% 52.80% ~0.89 Gate.io 47.42% 52.58% ~0.90 As you can see, all three top exchanges mirror the overall trend, showing a slight majority of short positions over long positions. Bybit and Gate.io show a slightly stronger short bias compared to Binance, although the differences are not dramatic. This consistency across major platforms reinforces the observation of a prevailing, albeit slight, bearish edge in market sentiment for BTC perpetual futures during this period. What Can We Infer from This Bitcoin Analysis? Based on these long-short ratio figures for BTC perpetual futures : The immediate market sentiment appears cautiously bearish. More traders are positioned to profit from a price decline than a price increase. The ratios are not extremely skewed in either direction (e.g., 70% long or short), suggesting that while there’s a short bias, it’s not an overwhelming consensus. This might indicate uncertainty or a lack of strong conviction for a major move in either direction based solely on this data point. Consistency across major exchanges like Binance, Bybit, and Gate.io adds some weight to the observed trend. For those performing Bitcoin analysis , this data point suggests vigilance. While a slight short bias exists, it’s crucial to combine this with other indicators. Actionable Insights for Crypto Trading How can traders use this long-short ratio information when trading BTC perpetual futures ? Context is Key: Don’t trade based on the ratio alone. Use it as one data point among many (price action, volume, funding rates, news). Watch for Changes: Monitor how the ratio evolves over time. A rapid shift towards one side could signal changing sentiment or potential volatility. Consider Counter-Trend Strategies: In some cases, extreme ratios can be contrarian indicators. However, the current ratios are not extreme, so this is less applicable here. Manage Risk: Regardless of the ratio, always use stop-losses and manage your position size when trading leveraged products like BTC perpetual futures . Challenges and Limitations of Using Long-Short Ratios While helpful, relying solely on the long-short ratio has limitations: Data Source: Ratios can vary slightly depending on the data provider and the exchanges included in their aggregation. Trader Intent: The ratio reflects open positions, but doesn’t reveal the full strategy or conviction behind them. Some short positions might be hedges, not speculative bets on a price drop. Lagging Indicator: The ratio reflects positions already taken, not necessarily future actions. Therefore, integrate this Bitcoin analysis tool wisely into your broader crypto trading framework. Conclusion: What Does This Mean for BTC Perpetual Futures? The recent 24-hour data for BTC perpetual futures reveals a slight lean towards short positions across major exchanges like Binance, Bybit, and Gate.io. This indicates a marginally bearish market sentiment among derivatives traders during this specific period. While not an extreme deviation, this trend is consistent and provides valuable insight for those engaged in crypto trading and Bitcoin analysis . Remember to use this data point in conjunction with other market indicators to make informed trading decisions.

2025-05-30T14:00:42.000Z,"Analyst Predicts Big Drop For Bitcoin Price As Bearish Pressures Mount After $111,000 ATH","Bitcoin is showing signs of fatigue after reaching a new all-time high of $111,814 on May 22. Since then, Bitcoin has had multiple failed attempts to break above this level, which has led to an increase in bearish pressure. Over the past several days, price action has begun forming a sequence of lower highs on the 4-hour timeframe, which, according to technical analysis on the TradingView platform, is interpreted as a signal that bullish momentum may be losing steam. Resistance Rejects Again With Double Top Risk The analyst behind the TradingView post highlighted the clear rejection pattern near the $111,000 to $112,000 zone, which Bitcoin has repeatedly tested since last week but has failed to break through. This repeated failure to break higher says that bullish momentum is fading fast, especially as retail buyers are now somewhat hesitant to buy at this zone. Related Reading: Crypto Market Today: 5 Bullish Catalysts To Watch That Say Bitcoin Price Is Going Higher According to the chart analysis, the current price movement is beginning to resemble a classic double top structure, which is a technical formation that often signals a shift from bullish control to bearish dominance. Given the weakening follow-through on each upward attempt, this setup could be the early signal of a more significant market reversal in the days ahead. With this in mind, the analyst illustrated this outlook with a projected zigzag path on a 4-hour candlestick timeframe chart, anticipating that another rejection from the resistance band could trigger a cascading move downward. Furthermore, these multiple rejections have led to a simultaneous weakening of support around $105,000, and this level could give way at any time soon. Bitcoin Might Drop To $102,000 Support Zone If this projected zigzag path plays out, Bitcoin’s price could break lower in the coming days and head toward a support area located between $101,000 and $102,000. This zone comes into focus because it acted as a strong support level between May 14 and May 19. Bitcoin eventually found footing around this level to stage a rebound that ultimately pushed it to the all-time high of $111,900 reached on May 22. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Bounces Off Re-Accumulation Zone: Why $120,000 Could Be Next Although the bull market narrative is still dominant in the long term, the current price action has shifted the short-term tone of the market to bearish. This analysis addresses that potential, and Bitcoin could revisit the $101,000 to $102,000 before another leg up. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $105,272, down by 2.5% in the past 24 hours. The $106,800 support level has already given way, and the focus is now on holding above $105,000. If Bitcoin fails to hold above $105,000 in the coming trading sessions, it could lead to a cascading downturn towards $101,000 during the weekend.

2025-05-30T14:00:03.000Z,"Crypto’s Future At Stake—Regulate Now Or Lose $3 Trillion Industry Abroad—JD Vance","In Nashville on Wednesday, US Vice President JD Vance spoke at a bitcoin conference and urged the crypto world to stay plugged into politics. He said the industry must back lawmakers who promise clear rules. He warned that without action, the $3 trillion industry could leave the country. Vance spoke with a mix of urgency and optimism. His goal was to rally support for a Washington‐friendly approach to rules. Vance Warns Of Offshore Risk According to Vance, “If we fail to create regulatory clarity now, we risk chasing this $3 trillion industry offshore in search of a friendly jurisdiction.” He pointed out that firms have already started to look abroad for clearer rules. He did not name any specific companies. He made it clear that the current window is rare and fast‐closing. Crypto’s Political Clout On Display Based on reports, crypto heavyweights played a big role in last year’s election. Vance singled out Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss of Gemini for their campaign giving. He said their efforts helped elect pro‐crypto lawmakers. He praised how quickly the industry organized. He also thanked conference attendees for their own donations. It showed just how much clout crypto now has in US politics. Trump Administration’s Crypto Moves Vance highlighted steps taken since US President Donald Trump took office. He noted the creation of a strategic bitcoin reserve funded by Treasury‐forfeited coins. He mentioned the pardon of Ross Ulbricht, who founded Silk Road, as a sign of a softer stance. He said regulators have paused some enforcement actions against big crypto firms, and argued those moves have sent a signal that America wants this business. Trump Family’s Stakes And Stablecoin Push The Trump family holds about 60% of World Liberty Financial, which just launched its own stablecoin. Based on reports, that stablecoin ties its value to the US dollar. He said stablecoins could grow fast under a clear federal framework. Vance pointed to Senate action earlier this month on a bill to regulate those coins. He urged lawmakers to pass it quickly. New Ventures And Big Bets Vance also mentioned that the Trump media company is raising $2.5 billion to buy bitcoin . He noted that both the president and first lady have minted their own meme coins. Eric and Don Jr., he said, are teaming up with a firm to start a crypto mining business, adding that the family’s moves show confidence in digital assets.

2025-05-30T14:00:03.000Z,"Bitcoin Inflows Surge: A Powerful Signal Mirroring 2021 Peak","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Inflows Surge: A Powerful Signal Mirroring 2021 Peak Get ready to dive into some fascinating data that’s catching the eye of crypto enthusiasts and analysts alike! We’re seeing something remarkable happening with Bitcoin inflows – the sheer amount of capital pouring into the leading cryptocurrency is starting to look eerily similar to the peak of the last major Bitcoin bull run in 2021. This isn’t just a small uptick; it’s a significant trend that could have major implications for the future BTC price and the overall Crypto market analysis . What Do These Massive Bitcoin Inflows Tell Us? According to crypto analyst Axel Adler Jr, who shared his insights on X, the daily capital inflows into Bitcoin are currently averaging around $1.8 billion. To put that into perspective, this figure is comparable to the levels witnessed in November 2021. Why is that date significant? Well, that’s when Bitcoin was trading near its then-all-time high, hovering around the $64,000 mark. But it gets even more interesting. The current cycle has already seen days with even larger inflows. Peaks near the $73,000 and $92,000 price levels saw astonishing inflows of $3.6 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively. These numbers are not only higher than the recent daily average but also surpass many peaks from previous cycles. What does this data fundamentally mean? Capital inflows represent the money moving into Bitcoin, whether through direct purchases, exchange deposits, or investment vehicles like ETFs. High inflows indicate strong buying pressure and, crucially, robust investor demand . It suggests that market participants, both large and small, are actively accumulating BTC, even at relatively high price levels. Here’s a quick look at the inflow comparison: Current Average Daily Inflows: ~$1.8 billion 2021 Peak Inflows (around $64k BTC price): Comparable to $1.8 billion average Recent Peak Inflows (near $73k BTC price): $3.6 billion Recent Peak Inflows (near $92k BTC price): $4.5 billion This comparison highlights that not only is the *average* inflow rate returning to previous bull market highs, but the *peak* inflow events in this cycle have already exceeded those from 2021. This is a powerful indicator of sustained and growing interest in Bitcoin. Comparing Today’s Bitcoin Inflows to the 2021 Bitcoin Bull Run Peak Drawing parallels between the current market environment and the 2021 Bitcoin bull run peak is essential for understanding the potential trajectory of BTC price . In November 2021, the market was characterized by euphoric sentiment, widespread retail participation, and significant institutional interest following a strong upward trend throughout the year. Today, while sentiment might not be pure euphoria across the board, the data on Bitcoin inflows suggests a level of capital commitment that mirrors, or even surpasses, that peak period. This is happening even after Bitcoin has already achieved new all-time highs in this cycle. This persistent buying activity, even above previous peaks, is a strong signal of underlying strength and confidence in Bitcoin’s value proposition. One key difference between now and 2021 is the regulatory landscape and the availability of investment products. The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. earlier this year has opened up a significant new channel for capital to flow into Bitcoin, particularly from institutional investors and traditional finance platforms. This structural change could be a major driver behind the sustained high investor demand we are observing. While the dollar amounts of inflows are comparable or higher, it’s also worth considering the context of market capitalization. Bitcoin’s market cap is significantly larger now than it was in 2021. However, the *rate* of capital inflow relative to market cap or trading volume still provides valuable insight into the intensity of buying pressure. What’s Driving This Strong Investor Demand for BTC Price? Several factors likely contribute to the impressive investor demand reflected in the recent Bitcoin inflows : Spot Bitcoin ETFs: As mentioned, these vehicles provide easy, regulated access to Bitcoin exposure for a wide range of investors, including institutions and wealth managers who were previously hesitant or unable to invest directly. The daily flows into these ETFs are closely watched indicators of institutional interest. Macroeconomic Uncertainty: In an environment of inflation concerns, geopolitical tensions, and unpredictable monetary policies, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed by some as a potential hedge or store of value, similar to digital gold. The Halving Event: While the most recent Bitcoin halving occurred recently, the narrative surrounding the event – which reduces the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market – has been a major catalyst for price speculation and accumulation in the months leading up to it. Investors anticipate that reduced supply combined with increasing demand will drive up the BTC price . Growing Adoption and Recognition: Bitcoin continues to gain mainstream recognition and adoption, with more companies and individuals understanding its technology and potential. This increasing awareness fuels broader investor demand . FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): As Bitcoin’s price rises and positive news circulates, retail investors may experience FOMO, leading to increased buying activity and contributing to inflows. Understanding these drivers is crucial for any comprehensive Crypto market analysis . They paint a picture of a market where conviction remains high, despite price volatility. How Do High Inflows Impact the BTC Price and Crypto Market Analysis? High Bitcoin inflows are generally interpreted as a bullish signal for the BTC price . Increased buying pressure, especially at scale, tends to push prices upward, assuming supply remains constant or grows at a slower pace (which is the case with Bitcoin’s fixed supply and halving mechanism). The fact that significant inflows are occurring even after Bitcoin has surpassed previous all-time highs suggests that investors are not just buying dips but are confident in its potential for further appreciation. The large peak inflows near $73k and $92k indicate that new capital is entering the market at higher price points, absorbing supply and potentially setting new support levels. For broader Crypto market analysis , strong Bitcoin performance often has a ripple effect. Bitcoin is the market leader, and its trends frequently influence altcoins. Sustained Bitcoin inflows and a rising BTC price can boost overall market confidence, leading to increased activity and inflows into other cryptocurrencies as well. However, it’s important to remember that inflows are just one metric. While they indicate strong buying pressure, they don’t guarantee a linear price increase. Market sentiment can shift rapidly, and large outflows can occur, potentially leading to price corrections. External factors, regulatory news, and global economic events can also significantly impact the market. Are There Any Challenges or Risks Associated with These Inflows? While high Bitcoin inflows are generally positive, they aren’t without potential risks: Potential for Rapid Outflows: Just as capital can flow in quickly, it can also flow out rapidly, especially if market sentiment changes or a significant negative event occurs. This can lead to sharp price declines. Market Overheating: Extremely high inflows coupled with rapid price increases could indicate an overheated market, potentially leading to speculative bubbles that are prone to bursting. Concentration Risk: If a significant portion of inflows is concentrated among a few large players (like specific ETFs or institutions), their actions could have a disproportionate impact on the market. A thorough Crypto market analysis must consider both the positive signals from inflows and these potential risks. Actionable Insights for Investors and Enthusiasts What can you take away from this analysis of Bitcoin inflows and investor demand ? Monitor Inflow Data: Keep an eye on metrics like exchange net flows, ETF flows, and on-chain analysis of capital movements. These provide real-time insights into buying and selling pressure. Understand the Context: Don’t look at inflow data in isolation. Consider it alongside other factors like macroeconomic news, regulatory developments, and technical analysis of the BTC price charts. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: While high inflows are bullish, the crypto market remains volatile. Ensure your investment decisions align with your personal risk tolerance and financial goals. Focus on Long-Term Trends: The sustained nature of these high inflows, mirroring the 2021 Bitcoin bull run levels, suggests a potentially enduring shift in investor demand . Consider the long-term implications rather than just short-term price movements. Conclusion: Bitcoin Inflows Signal Enduring Strength The data is compelling: Bitcoin inflows are currently rivaling, and in some instances exceeding, the levels seen during the peak of the 2021 Bitcoin bull run . This isn’t a fleeting trend; it reflects powerful and sustained investor demand , likely fueled by new investment vehicles like spot ETFs, macroeconomic factors, and the inherent appeal of Bitcoin as a scarce digital asset. While the current BTC price fluctuates (CoinMarketCap data shows BTC trading around $106,142.73, down 1.38% over the past day at the time of the original analysis), the underlying capital flows suggest a market with strong conviction. This robust buying pressure is a significant factor to consider in any Crypto market analysis and points towards continued potential for growth, although vigilance regarding market risks remains essential.

2025-05-30T13:57:08.000Z,"What Does the Pullback in Bitcoin Tell Us? What to Expect from BTC Next? Experienced Analyst Evaluated!","As Bitcoin (BTC) falls to $105,000 after hitting a record high of $111,000, investors are wondering whether this is a healthy pullback or a turning point that could lead to further declines. While there are many predictions at this point, Derive founder Nick Forster stated that the pullback is healthy and that recent movements show that Bitcoin has entered a consolidation phase rather than a downward trend. Nick Forster noted that Bitcoin’s current consolidation will give the market time to digest recent gains before it enters a new uptrend. Stating that this consolidation phase will prepare Bitcoin for the next rise, the analyst stated that it is healthy and not a bearish signal. “While the recent rally above $111,000 in Bitcoin is noteworthy, the current price action suggests a consolidation phase rather than an imminent uptrend or downtrend. “Such a consolidation phase would be healthy ahead of another significant rally and would give the necessary time to prepare for the next rally.” Forster said that according to historical data, the third quarter was a weak period for Bitcoin, but argued that a different scenario could occur in 2025. “Historically, Q3 is seen as a bearish period, but this year, with positive factors such as regulatory changes and increased institutional inflows, Bitcoin has the potential to deliver exceptional and surprising performance in Q3. At this point, the FED's interest rate decision on June 18 could be a critical and important turning point for the market.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-30T13:40:03.000Z,"US Spot ETH ETF Inflows Soar: Ninth Straight Day of Positive Momentum","BitcoinWorld US Spot ETH ETF Inflows Soar: Ninth Straight Day of Positive Momentum Hey crypto enthusiasts! Have you been keeping an eye on the latest developments in the world of exchange-traded funds? There’s some exciting news coming out of the United States regarding US Spot ETH ETF products. These investment vehicles, which directly hold Ethereum (ETH) as their underlying asset, are showing impressive momentum, attracting significant capital. What Happened with ETH ETF Inflows on May 29? The big headline is the substantial net inflow recorded by ETH ETF products in the U.S. On May 29th, these funds collectively saw a net inflow of a cool $91.9 million. This figure, reported by Farside Investors, is particularly noteworthy because it extends a positive trend that began over a week prior. Yes, you read that right – May 29th marked the ninth consecutive day of net inflows for these newly active investment products. This consistent positive flow suggests growing investor confidence and interest in gaining exposure to Ethereum through traditional brokerage accounts. Breaking Down the Crypto ETF Inflows by Fund While the overall number is compelling, looking at the individual fund performance gives us a clearer picture of where the money is going. Here’s a quick breakdown of the major players and their activity on May 29th: BlackRock’s ETHA: Led the pack with a significant $50.4 million in net inflows. BlackRock’s entry into the crypto ETF space has been closely watched, and their fund is quickly becoming a major force. Fidelity’s FETH: Was the second strongest performer, bringing in $38.3 million. Fidelity is another major financial institution signaling strong demand for Ethereum exposure. Bitwise’s ETHW: Added a respectable $4.6 million to its holdings. Grayscale’s ETH: Saw a modest $3.2 million inflow into its new spot product. Grayscale’s ETHE: In contrast to the inflows into the new spot products, Grayscale’s existing trust, which converted into an ETF (ETHE), continued to see outflows, losing $4.6 million on the day. This mirrors a trend seen with the Bitcoin ETFs, where the conversion of the existing Grayscale trust led to significant initial outflows as investors potentially rotated into newer, lower-fee products or cashed out. Other registered Ethereum ETF products reportedly saw no change in their holdings on May 29th. Why Are Spot ETH ETF Inflows Important for the Crypto Market? The approval and subsequent performance of Spot ETH ETF products in the U.S. are pivotal moments for the entire Crypto Market . Here’s why these inflows matter: Firstly, they represent a significant step towards mainstream adoption. These ETFs make it easier for institutional investors, financial advisors, and retail investors to get exposure to Ethereum without needing to directly buy, store, and secure the cryptocurrency itself. This accessibility opens the door to a much larger pool of potential capital. Secondly, consistent inflows signal growing institutional interest and confidence in Ethereum as an asset class. When major firms like BlackRock and Fidelity see substantial money flowing into their ETH products, it validates Ethereum’s position in the financial landscape. Thirdly, these inflows can have a direct impact on the price of Ethereum. As ETFs buy ETH on the open market to back the shares they issue, increased demand from these large funds can contribute to upward price pressure. Think back to the launch of the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year. Their approval and subsequent inflows were widely credited with helping drive Bitcoin’s price to new all-time highs. While the dynamics for Ethereum might differ slightly, the principle of significant new demand entering the market remains the same. What Does This Mean for Investors? For existing crypto investors, these trends are generally positive indicators of market maturation and increasing demand. For those new to crypto or looking for easier ways to invest, US Spot ETH ETF s offer a regulated and familiar pathway. However, it’s crucial to remember that while ETFs offer convenience, they don’t eliminate market risk. The value of an ETH ETF is directly tied to the price of Ethereum, which is known for its volatility. Investors should always conduct their own research and consider their risk tolerance before investing. The consistent Crypto ETF Inflows into Ethereum funds are a clear signal that the market is reacting positively to the availability of these new investment products. It suggests that there is pent-up demand from investors who were previously unable or unwilling to invest directly in ETH. Looking Ahead: The Future of the Ethereum ETF Landscape The nine consecutive days of inflows, capped by the $91.9 million on May 29th, paint a promising picture for the future of the ETH ETF market in the U.S. While initial trading volumes and inflows might not match the explosive start seen by the Bitcoin ETFs, the consistent positive trend is arguably just as significant, indicating steady, accumulating interest rather than just initial hype. Market participants will be closely watching the inflow data in the coming weeks to see if this trend continues. Sustained inflows could provide a strong tailwind for Ethereum’s price and further solidify its position as a major asset class alongside Bitcoin in the traditional financial world. Challenges remain, of course. Regulatory clarity beyond the initial ETF approval will be important, and the inherent volatility of the crypto market means price swings are always possible. Nevertheless, the successful launch and positive initial performance of these ETFs mark a significant milestone.

2025-05-30T13:38:55.000Z,"Crypto Price Analysis 5-30: BITCOIN: BTC, ETHEREUM: ETH, SOLANA: SOL, CELESTIA: TIA, INTERNET COMPUTER: ICP, FILECOIN: FIL","The crypto market registered a substantial decline as Bitcoin (BTC) , Ethereum (ETH) , and other altcoins fell from key levels. BTC lost momentum late on Thursday and fell from $108,886 to a low of $104,802 before recovering to reclaim $105,000 and move to its current level. The flagship cryptocurrency is down over 1% in the past 24 hours, trading around $106,192. Meanwhile, ETH slipped below $2,700 after dropping over 3% in the past 24 hours. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is trading at around $2,638. Ripple (XRP) continued its bearish trajectory, with the price down almost 3%, while Solana (SOL) fell below $170 after a drop of nearly 4%, and is currently around $165. Dogecoin (DOGE) has registered a substantial decline, with the price down almost 8%. Cardano (ADA) , Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR) , Litecoin (LTC) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered significant declines. However, Toncoin (TON) bucked the bearish trend and is up over 1%. Proof-Of-Stake Does Not Constitute Securities Transactions The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has said that certain blockchain staking activities do not involve the offering of securities. The SEC stated its view involves the staking of “covered crypto assets” on Proof-of-Stake networks, activities of third-party service providers like custodians and node operators, and ancillary services. “Accordingly, it is the Division's view that participants in Protocol Staking Activities do not need to register with the Commission transactions under the Securities Act.” Specifically, ancillary services encompass self-storage, self-custodial staking with a third party, and custodial management, where custodians stake on behalf of asset owners. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce welcomed the decision, stating, “Today's statement provides welcome clarity for stakers and 'staking-as-a-service' providers in the United States.” China Imposes Fresh Ban On Crypto China has announced a sweeping new ban on crypto, prohibiting not just the trading and mining of cryptocurrencies but also the individual ownership of cryptocurrencies like BTC. The move is a significant escalation of China’s hardline approach to crypto, reiterating its commitment to centralizing financial control and promoting the use of the state-backed digital yuan. The announcement had an immediate impact on the crypto market, as BTC registered a sharp dip, and altcoins followed suit, exhibiting even greater volatility. The ban allows Beijing to tighten its grip on financial flows in the country and accelerate the adoption of the digital yuan. It could also prompt greater decentralization in crypto across Asia as users seek alternative jurisdictions with more favorable policies. US Markets Close Green Despite Tariff Uncertainty US stocks closed in positive territory, with the S&P 500 up 0.4% after Nvidia’s strong first-quarter earnings boosted investor sentiment. However, the gains were limited due to renewed uncertainty around President Donald Trump’s tariff policies following conflicting court decisions. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.39%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 127 points. Price action turned negative after a federal court reinstated tariffs on the European Union hours after the US Court of International Trade ruled them unlawful. Investors are wary of President Trump’s inconsistent stance on trade, particularly regarding the reciprocal tariff policy, which adds to concerns about persistent inflation. Several companies in the US have cited tariffs as key reasons behind the weaker forecasts. SEC Dismisses Lawsuit Against Binance The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has dismissed its civil lawsuit against Binance, continuing its new approach to crypto since President Donald Trump assumed office. Lawyers for the SEC, Binance, and Binance founder Changpeng Zhao signed a joint stipulation of dismissal filed in the Washington DC federal court. The SEC stated that dismissing the enforcement case was appropriate in the exercise of its discretion and as a policy matter. However, it added that the action did not reflect its view on other cryptocurrency litigation. The dismissal with prejudice means the SEC cannot pursue the case again. A Binance spokesperson called the dismissal a landmark moment, stating, “We're deeply grateful to (SEC) Chairman Paul Atkins and the Trump administration for recognizing that innovation can't thrive under regulation by enforcement.” Binance was accused of artificially inflating trading volumes, diverting customer funds, and misleading investors about its surveillance tools. The exchange has also been accused of unlawfully facilitating the trading of several crypto tokens that the SEC leadership under the previous administration had classified as securities. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) dipped below $106,000 on Thursday as selling pressure intensified, with the price dropping over 2% to a low of $105,417 before registering a marginal recovery. Despite the substantial pullback, analysts believe sentiment around BTC will remain positive as long as the flagship cryptocurrency holds its position above $100,000. BTC has maintained its position above this level despite volatility and selling pressure. BTC had jumped to an intraday high of $108,944 early on Thursday as buyers thronged the market before losing momentum. Analysts are divided over BTC’s next course of action, with some calling it a healthy pause and others expressing concerns about growing selling pressure and a drop to $100,000. Some analysts anticipate a sideways move thanks to uncertainty about tariffs, but this cannot be interpreted as a bearish signal. “While the recent surge to over $111,000 was notable, the current price action suggests a phase of consolidation rather than an imminent breakout.” Analysts believe a consolidation phase could be healthy before BTC begins another significant upward move, with a pause in the rally giving the market time to gear up for the next phase of the bull run. Market watchers believe that BTC’s peak is still some way away and that Q3, historically a weak quarter for BTC, could surprise markets in 2025. However, some conservative analysts have expressed concerns about BTC’s immediate outlook, highlighting the emergence of an elevated market risk signal through the “Standardized 60-Day Realized Cap Volatility (RCV)” metric. The indicator is used to assess risk levels and recently crossed a critical historical threshold. However, if BTC can maintain its position above $105,000 and reclaim $110,000, it could become a robust base for another rally if momentum holds. BTC started the previous week in the red, falling to an intraday low of $102,135 before rebounding to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,572. The price recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.21% to $106,854. Bullish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as BTC rose nearly 3% to cross $109,000 and settle at $109,603. BTC raced to a new all-time high on Thursday, reaching $111,970 before registering a marginal decline and settling at $111,589. However, markets turned bearish on Friday, and BTC plunged almost 4% and settled at $107,356. Source: TradingView BTC recovered over the weekend, registering a marginal increase on Saturday and rising 1.16% on Sunday to reclaim $109,000 and settle at $109,103. The price registered a marginal rise on Monday but fell back in the red on Tuesday after facing selling pressure and volatility and settling at $108,954. Sellers retained control on Wednesday, with the price dropping 1.03% to $107,834. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC fell over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,662. The current session sees BTC marginally down, trading around $105,000. If BTC dips below this level, it could drop to $100,000. On the other hand, if momentum returns, the flagship cryptocurrency could return above $110,000. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) extended its losses during the ongoing session, with the price marginally down after registering a drop of nearly 2% on Thursday after being rejected from $2,800 again. ETH is at a crucial point, with over $2.4 billion in ETH options set to expire on May 30 if the price holds above $2,600. This could support ETH’s attempt to reclaim $2,700 for the first time in nearly 3 months and break above the $2,800 level. ETH bulls will be highly motivated to keep the price above $2,600. However, limited network activity suggests the upside potential could be limited. Analysts believe ETH’s subdued performance is due to growing competition among blockchains focusing on decentralized applications. However, ETH holds a key advantage: It is the only altcoin with a spot ETF offering in the US. Ethereum ETFs attracted $287 million in net inflows between May 19 and May 27, indicating growing interest from institutional investors. ETH registered a significant drop on Monday (May 19) as it plunged to a low of $2,349. The price recovered from this level to register an increase of 1.18% and settle at $2,527. It registered a marginal decline on Tuesday but recovered on Wednesday, rising 1.10% to $2,550 despite volatility and selling pressure. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as ETH rose over 4% to cross $2,600 and settle at $2,664. The price reached an intraday high of $2,731 on Friday as buyers attempted a move to $2,800. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and fell over 5% to $2,527. Source: TradingView ETH recovered over the weekend, registering a marginal increase on Saturday before rising almost 1% on Sunday to settle at $2,551. The current week started positively, with the price increasing 0.49% to $2,564. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as ETH rose nearly 4% and settled at $2,662. The price continued to push higher on Wednesday, increasing almost 1% and settling at $2,683. ETH raced to an intraday high of $2,791 on Thursday but lost momentum after reaching this level and fell nearly 2% to $2,633. The current session sees ETH marginally down as sellers look to lower the price. ETH bulls will attempt to keep the price above $2,600 and build momentum to move towards $2,700. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) continued to descend as it slipped below $170 on Thursday and extended its losses during the ongoing session, falling to a low of $160 before rebounding to current levels. SOL faces renewed selling pressure, which could drag it below $160. SOL is facing immediate resistance around $170, a level it must reclaim to realize a move towards $180. SOL faced selling pressure on Monday (May 19), falling nearly 4% and settling at $166 after dropping to a low of $159. The price recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.05% to $168. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as SOL reclaimed $170 and settled at $173. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as the price rose 3.52% and settled at $179. SOL raced to an intraday high of $187 on Friday but lost momentum after reaching this level. As a result, it dropped over 3% and settled at $173. Source: TradingView SOL rebounded on Saturday, rising 1.09% to settle at $175. However, it was back in the red on Sunday, registering a marginal decline and settling at $175. SOL remained bearish on Monday and settled at $174, but rebounded on Tuesday and moved to $176 after an increase of 1.03%. Selling pressure returned on Wednesday as the price fell 2.55%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $172. Sellers retained control on Thursday as SOL fell over 3% to $166. SOL fell to a low of $160 during the ongoing session but has rebounded to trade around $163, down nearly 2%. Celestia (TIA) Price Analysis Celestia (TIA) has registered high volatility and selling pressure after losing the $3 level on May 15. It started the previous week in the red, dropping 2.64% to a low of $2.51 before settling at $2.64. The price recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.51% to $2.68. However, TIA was back in the red Wednesday, dropping 1.04% after facing selling pressure and volatility. Despite the negative sentiment, TIA rebounded on Thursday, rising almost 7% to cross the 20 and 50-day SMAs and settle at $2.83. TIA raced to an intraday high of $3.07 on Friday. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and plunged over 12%, slipping below the 20 and 50-day SMAs and settling at $2.48. Source: TradingView Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, TIA recovered over the weekend, rising 1.64% on Saturday and 1.29% on Sunday to settle at $2.56.

The current session sees TIA down over 6%, trading around $2.34 as sellers look to drive the price below key support levels. Internet Computer (ICP) Price Analysis Internet Computer (ICP) registered a sharp drop on Monday (May 19) but made a strong recovery the following day, rising nearly 1% despite facing selling pressure and volatility and settling at $5.26. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as the price registered an increase of almost 2% and settled at $5.35. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as ICP surged over 6% and settled at $5.69.

2025-05-30T13:38:08.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Cantor’s New Gold-Insured BTC Product Could Attract Billions","Bitcoin (BTC) is trading near $105,310 on Friday, struggling to bounce back from a 3% weekly drop after profit-taking at a three-month high. But a game-changer from Cantor Fitzgerald may shift sentiment. A gold-backed Bitcoin fund is being launched, combining Bitcoin’s upside with gold’s stability for risk-averse investors and potentially increasing demand for BTC. Cantor’s CEO, Brandon Lutnick, explained that the firm will achieve full participation in Bitcoin’s gains, with physical gold holdings to cushion against price drops. As gold is up 25% year-to-date, this may attract investors who have been hesitant to invest in crypto due to its volatility. Bitcoin Fund With Gold Shield Launches Cantor Fitzgerald unveils a no-cap Bitcoin fund with built-in gold hedging, offering institutional investors inflation protection plus BTC upside. https://t.co/2ZabTPYL8h — Crypto economy (EN) (@CryptoEconomyEN) May 30, 2025 Cantor Fitzgerald has a long history in the crypto space, including managing Tether’s reserves, so this is a credible move. Gold-backed protection with whole Bitcoin upside Crypto innovation with safe-haven assets Cantor’s strategy targets institutional investors The fund is launching soon and represents a new way for traditional investors to access crypto without the usual volatility. It’s coming at a time when crypto funds are surging and is a solution for diversification. Institutional Moves Show Strong Bitcoin Confidence While retail investors remain hesitant, institutions are fully committed to Bitcoin. This week alone, Strategy added 4,020 BTC worth $427 million, bringing their total to 580,250 BTC. GameStop bought 4,710 BTC after raising $1.3 billion in convertible notes and diversified its corporate treasury.

These strategic purchases demonstrate strong confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term future, despite short-term price fluctuations. Meanwhile, US spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $458.82 million in inflows this week and $5.85 billion in May inflows, the highest since last December and surpassing even the post-US election levels. This is Bitcoin becoming a core asset in portfolios. $458.82 million ETF inflows show growing demand Corporate treasuries are increasing BTC allocations Institutional adoption is long-term confidence Technical Outlook: Bitcoin Slides Below Key Support Technically, the BTC/USD pair is in a descending channel, and selling pressure remains persistent. Price is below the 50-period EMA ($107,531) and key support is at $104,683, with further downside targets at $103,395 and $102,168. Momentum indicators are cautionary, the MACD histogram is fading, and the RSI is below neutral. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview However, long lower wicks at support suggest buyer defense, but there is no follow-through. A break above $107,531, accompanied by bullish engulfing candles or three white soldiers, could lead to $108,221-$109,589. A break below $104,683 with a shooting star or three black crows could be $103,395 or lower.
