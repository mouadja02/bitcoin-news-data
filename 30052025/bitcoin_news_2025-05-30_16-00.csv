2025-05-30T13:57:08.000Z,"What Does the Pullback in Bitcoin Tell Us? What to Expect from BTC Next? Experienced Analyst Evaluated!","As Bitcoin (BTC) falls to $105,000 after hitting a record high of $111,000, investors are wondering whether this is a healthy pullback or a turning point that could lead to further declines. While there are many predictions at this point, Derive founder Nick Forster stated that the pullback is healthy and that recent movements show that Bitcoin has entered a consolidation phase rather than a downward trend. Nick Forster noted that Bitcoin’s current consolidation will give the market time to digest recent gains before it enters a new uptrend. Stating that this consolidation phase will prepare Bitcoin for the next rise, the analyst stated that it is healthy and not a bearish signal. “While the recent rally above $111,000 in Bitcoin is noteworthy, the current price action suggests a consolidation phase rather than an imminent uptrend or downtrend. “Such a consolidation phase would be healthy ahead of another significant rally and would give the necessary time to prepare for the next rally.” Forster said that according to historical data, the third quarter was a weak period for Bitcoin, but argued that a different scenario could occur in 2025. “Historically, Q3 is seen as a bearish period, but this year, with positive factors such as regulatory changes and increased institutional inflows, Bitcoin has the potential to deliver exceptional and surprising performance in Q3. At this point, the FED's interest rate decision on June 18 could be a critical and important turning point for the market.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-30T13:40:03.000Z,"US Spot ETH ETF Inflows Soar: Ninth Straight Day of Positive Momentum","BitcoinWorld US Spot ETH ETF Inflows Soar: Ninth Straight Day of Positive Momentum Hey crypto enthusiasts! Have you been keeping an eye on the latest developments in the world of exchange-traded funds? There’s some exciting news coming out of the United States regarding US Spot ETH ETF products. These investment vehicles, which directly hold Ethereum (ETH) as their underlying asset, are showing impressive momentum, attracting significant capital. What Happened with ETH ETF Inflows on May 29? The big headline is the substantial net inflow recorded by ETH ETF products in the U.S. On May 29th, these funds collectively saw a net inflow of a cool $91.9 million. This figure, reported by Farside Investors, is particularly noteworthy because it extends a positive trend that began over a week prior. Yes, you read that right – May 29th marked the ninth consecutive day of net inflows for these newly active investment products. This consistent positive flow suggests growing investor confidence and interest in gaining exposure to Ethereum through traditional brokerage accounts. Breaking Down the Crypto ETF Inflows by Fund While the overall number is compelling, looking at the individual fund performance gives us a clearer picture of where the money is going. Here’s a quick breakdown of the major players and their activity on May 29th: BlackRock’s ETHA: Led the pack with a significant $50.4 million in net inflows. BlackRock’s entry into the crypto ETF space has been closely watched, and their fund is quickly becoming a major force. Fidelity’s FETH: Was the second strongest performer, bringing in $38.3 million. Fidelity is another major financial institution signaling strong demand for Ethereum exposure. Bitwise’s ETHW: Added a respectable $4.6 million to its holdings. Grayscale’s ETH: Saw a modest $3.2 million inflow into its new spot product. Grayscale’s ETHE: In contrast to the inflows into the new spot products, Grayscale’s existing trust, which converted into an ETF (ETHE), continued to see outflows, losing $4.6 million on the day. This mirrors a trend seen with the Bitcoin ETFs, where the conversion of the existing Grayscale trust led to significant initial outflows as investors potentially rotated into newer, lower-fee products or cashed out. Other registered Ethereum ETF products reportedly saw no change in their holdings on May 29th. Why Are Spot ETH ETF Inflows Important for the Crypto Market? The approval and subsequent performance of Spot ETH ETF products in the U.S. are pivotal moments for the entire Crypto Market . Here’s why these inflows matter: Firstly, they represent a significant step towards mainstream adoption. These ETFs make it easier for institutional investors, financial advisors, and retail investors to get exposure to Ethereum without needing to directly buy, store, and secure the cryptocurrency itself. This accessibility opens the door to a much larger pool of potential capital. Secondly, consistent inflows signal growing institutional interest and confidence in Ethereum as an asset class. When major firms like BlackRock and Fidelity see substantial money flowing into their ETH products, it validates Ethereum’s position in the financial landscape. Thirdly, these inflows can have a direct impact on the price of Ethereum. As ETFs buy ETH on the open market to back the shares they issue, increased demand from these large funds can contribute to upward price pressure. Think back to the launch of the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year. Their approval and subsequent inflows were widely credited with helping drive Bitcoin’s price to new all-time highs. While the dynamics for Ethereum might differ slightly, the principle of significant new demand entering the market remains the same. What Does This Mean for Investors? For existing crypto investors, these trends are generally positive indicators of market maturation and increasing demand. For those new to crypto or looking for easier ways to invest, US Spot ETH ETF s offer a regulated and familiar pathway. However, it’s crucial to remember that while ETFs offer convenience, they don’t eliminate market risk. The value of an ETH ETF is directly tied to the price of Ethereum, which is known for its volatility. Investors should always conduct their own research and consider their risk tolerance before investing. The consistent Crypto ETF Inflows into Ethereum funds are a clear signal that the market is reacting positively to the availability of these new investment products. It suggests that there is pent-up demand from investors who were previously unable or unwilling to invest directly in ETH. Looking Ahead: The Future of the Ethereum ETF Landscape The nine consecutive days of inflows, capped by the $91.9 million on May 29th, paint a promising picture for the future of the ETH ETF market in the U.S. While initial trading volumes and inflows might not match the explosive start seen by the Bitcoin ETFs, the consistent positive trend is arguably just as significant, indicating steady, accumulating interest rather than just initial hype. Market participants will be closely watching the inflow data in the coming weeks to see if this trend continues. Sustained inflows could provide a strong tailwind for Ethereum’s price and further solidify its position as a major asset class alongside Bitcoin in the traditional financial world. Challenges remain, of course. Regulatory clarity beyond the initial ETF approval will be important, and the inherent volatility of the crypto market means price swings are always possible. Nevertheless, the successful launch and positive initial performance of these ETFs mark a significant milestone. In Conclusion: A Strong Start for US Spot ETH ETFs The recent performance of US Spot ETH ETF s, highlighted by the $91.9 million net inflow on May 29th and nine consecutive days of positive flows, is a strong indicator of growing investor appetite for Ethereum exposure through regulated financial products. The data shows clear leaders emerging among the funds, with BlackRock and Fidelity attracting the largest portions of new capital, while Grayscale’s converted trust continues to see some rotation out. These consistent Crypto ETF Inflows are a bullish signal for the broader Crypto Market , suggesting increased accessibility and institutional validation for Ethereum. As the Ethereum ETF landscape evolves, its impact on ETH’s price and the overall market structure will be a key narrative to follow.

2025-05-30T13:30:30.000Z,"Tether Freeze: USDT Frozen in Major OFAC Sanctions Crackdown","BitcoinWorld Tether Freeze: USDT Frozen in Major OFAC Sanctions Crackdown In a significant move highlighting the increasing intersection of traditional finance regulations and the cryptocurrency world, stablecoin giants Tether and Circle have taken action against addresses linked to illicit activity. This development saw a Tether freeze and a Circle freeze on specific digital wallets, directly responding to sanctions imposed by U.S. authorities. Understanding the Recent Action: USDT Frozen Addresses Recent reports from crypto tracking platform MistTrack on X confirmed that approximately 19,955 USDT frozen across two addresses were linked to Funnull Technology. Funnull Technology is a computer infrastructure provider based in the Philippines. This action by Tether and Circle wasn’t arbitrary; it was a direct consequence of sanctions announced on May 29 by the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). OFAC targeted Funnull Technology for its alleged involvement in widespread ‘pig butchering’ scams. These sophisticated frauds manipulate victims into investing in fake crypto platforms, ultimately stealing their funds. By freezing the USDT held in these specific wallets, Tether and Circle are demonstrating their commitment to complying with international sanctions and combating the use of their stablecoins for illicit purposes. What Are OFAC Sanctions Crypto Targets? The U.S. Treasury’s OFAC plays a crucial role in enforcing U.S. foreign policy and national security goals through economic and trade sanctions. In recent years, as cryptocurrencies have become more widely adopted, OFAC’s focus has expanded to include digital assets and the entities that use them for illegal activities. OFAC sanctions crypto addresses and entities when there is evidence they are involved in: Terrorist financing Money laundering Cybercrime (like ransomware attacks or scams) Evading sanctions against rogue states or individuals The action against Funnull Technology is part of a broader effort by OFAC to disrupt the financial infrastructure used by cybercriminals, particularly those engaged in large-scale investment frauds like pig butchering scams. By identifying and sanctioning entities like Funnull, OFAC aims to make it harder for these criminal networks to operate and profit from their illegal activities. The Role of Tether and Circle in Compliance Tether, the issuer of USDT, and Circle, the issuer of USDC, are the two largest stablecoin providers globally. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, usually pegged to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar. Their stability makes them popular for trading, transferring value, and increasingly, for holding funds. As centralized entities that issue and manage these stablecoins, Tether and Circle have the technical capability to freeze assets held in specific addresses. This ability is a double-edged sword in the crypto community, often sparking debate about centralization versus decentralization principles. However, it is also a necessary function for these companies to comply with regulations and law enforcement requests. When OFAC issues sanctions targeting specific individuals or entities, it often includes identifying associated cryptocurrency addresses. Tether and Circle, like traditional financial institutions, are then obligated to screen their transactions and freeze funds linked to these sanctioned addresses. The Circle freeze and Tether freeze in the Funnull case are direct examples of this compliance mechanism in action. Why Stablecoin Regulation is Becoming Crucial The Funnull case underscores the growing importance of Stablecoin regulation . As stablecoins become integrated into the global financial system, regulators worldwide are scrutinizing how they are used and the potential risks they pose, including their use in illicit finance. Regulators are keen to ensure that stablecoin issuers have robust Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures in place. They also want to ensure issuers can comply with sanctions regimes, just like banks and other financial intermediaries. The ability of Tether and Circle to freeze the USDT frozen in the Funnull-linked addresses is often cited by regulators as a necessary feature for stablecoins to operate within legal frameworks. However, achieving effective Stablecoin regulation is complex. It involves balancing the need for compliance and financial stability with the innovative potential and decentralized ethos often associated with cryptocurrencies. The ongoing discussions around stablecoin legislation in various countries aim to strike this balance. Exploring Pig Butchering Scams and Crypto Use ‘Pig butchering’ scams, also known as ‘Sha Zhu Pan,’ are a particularly cruel type of investment fraud that has proliferated globally. The name comes from the idea of fattening a pig before slaughtering it. Here’s a simplified breakdown of how they typically work: Initial Contact: Scammers often make contact through dating apps, social media, or messaging platforms, building a rapport and romantic or friendly relationship with the victim over weeks or months. Building Trust: They share fabricated stories of wealth gained through cryptocurrency investments, presenting themselves as successful traders or insiders. The Setup: The scammer convinces the victim to invest a small amount on a seemingly legitimate-looking (but fake) trading platform or app. The victim might even see small, fabricated profits initially, encouraging them to invest more. The ‘Butchering’: Once the victim has invested a significant amount (the ‘fattening’), the scammer and the fake platform disappear, or the victim is told they need to pay exorbitant ‘taxes’ or ‘fees’ to withdraw their funds, which they never can. Cryptocurrencies, particularly stablecoins like USDT, are often the preferred method of payment for these scams because they can be sent quickly across borders and offer a degree of pseudonymity, making tracing and recovery difficult for victims and law enforcement. Funnull Technology’s alleged role likely involved providing infrastructure or services that facilitated these fraudulent platforms or the movement of illicit funds. The Implications of Stablecoin Freezes The ability of stablecoin issuers to freeze assets has significant implications for the crypto ecosystem: Enhanced Compliance: It allows issuers to cooperate with law enforcement and comply with sanctions, potentially reducing the use of stablecoins for illicit activities. This could make stablecoins more palatable to traditional financial institutions and regulators. Centralization Concerns: Critics argue that the power to freeze assets undermines the decentralized nature that many associate with cryptocurrencies. It gives issuers significant control, raising questions about who decides what gets frozen and under what authority. User Risk: While freezes primarily target illicit funds, there’s a theoretical risk of legitimate users being caught in the crossfire due to mistaken identity or association with sanctioned entities. Precedent Setting: Each instance of a freeze sets a precedent, reinforcing the expectation that stablecoin issuers will act as gatekeepers within the crypto space, similar to banks. The Tether freeze and Circle freeze on the Funnull addresses serve as a stark reminder that holding stablecoins issued by centralized entities comes with different considerations than holding truly decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Actionable Insights for Stablecoin Users Given these developments, what should stablecoin users know and do? Understand Your Stablecoin: Be aware of whether the stablecoin you hold is issued by a centralized entity (like USDT, USDC) or is algorithmic/decentralized (though these have faced other challenges). Centralized issuers can freeze assets under certain conditions. Know the Risks: Understand that compliance with sanctions and law enforcement is a reality for centralized stablecoin issuers. Your funds could potentially be frozen if linked, even indirectly, to sanctioned activity. Practice Due Diligence: Be extremely cautious of unsolicited investment advice, especially on social media or dating apps. Research any platform thoroughly before sending funds. If it sounds too good to be true, it almost certainly is. Use Reputable Platforms: Only use well-known, regulated cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with regulatory developments and how they impact the stablecoins you use. The fact that USDT frozen in this case was linked to alleged criminal activity underscores the ongoing battle against illicit finance in the crypto space. The Future of Stablecoins and Compliance The Funnull case is unlikely to be the last time we see stablecoin issuers acting on sanctions. As regulators like OFAC become more adept at tracing crypto flows, pressure on issuers to maintain robust compliance programs will only increase. This could lead to: More stringent KYC/AML requirements for stablecoin users, even for smaller transactions. Increased collaboration between stablecoin issuers, exchanges, tracking firms, and law enforcement. Potential regulatory frameworks specifically designed for stablecoins, mandating certain compliance capabilities. While some in the crypto community lament the centralization aspects highlighted by instances like the Tether freeze and Circle freeze , others see it as a necessary step for stablecoins to gain broader acceptance and integration into the mainstream financial system, provided it is done transparently and under clear legal authority. Summary: A Clear Message on Illicit Crypto Use The freezing of USDT by Tether and Circle in response to OFAC sanctions against Funnull Technology sends a clear message: the crypto ecosystem is not immune to traditional financial regulations and law enforcement actions, especially when it comes to centralized stablecoins. The USDT frozen represents a direct blow against the financial channels allegedly used by pig butchering scams. This event highlights the ongoing efforts by regulators to combat illicit finance using digital assets and the complex role stablecoin issuers play in navigating compliance while operating within a space that values decentralization. It reinforces the importance of robust Stablecoin regulation and serves as a critical reminder for users to exercise caution and conduct thorough due diligence to avoid becoming victims of scams facilitated by crypto.

However, alongside this massive player, a newcomer is making news: Yeti Ouro , a GameFi token on Ethereum that promises to add a brand new dimension to on-chain utility and blockchain gaming. Ethereum’s Massive Growth in May After the very well-received “ Pectra” hard for k and widespread adoption of Layer 2 rollups, Ethereum’s average transaction fee has fallen to a great extent. Suddenly, DeFi apps, NFT marketplaces, and even small-ticket transactions feel practical again. Daily active addresses are climbing, indicating more real-world use rather than just speculative trading. What’s driving this resurgence? A few factors: Rollup Explosion: The Majority of Ethereum transactions now occur on rollups like Arbitrum and Optimism. That frees the mainnet to handle higher-value operations, smoother smart contract calls, and large NFT mints without gas wars. Credits: TradingView Institutional Eyeballs: Big funds and tech firms are building on Ethereum again, whether issuing stablecoins for on-chain payments or deploying tokenized real estate. Their participation suggests a healthy foundation for Ethereum’s price. With ETH trading around $2600 and bullish analysts pointing to $4,000 by year-end, now feels like a strategic moment to revisit Ethereum’s potential. Yeti Ouro Presents A Strong Case YETIO is an ERC-20 token that finds its main product in YetiGo, a Play-to-Earn racing game built on Unreal Engine 5. Instead of simply buying tokens and hoping for a price bump, Yeti Ouro has announced a $100,000 giveaway ! There will be five winners of a grand raffle of $20,000 each in YETIO. YETIO holders can: Race to Earn : Compete in high-speed elimination-style races and earn YETIO for contest wins. Trade In-Game Assets : Purchase and sell game-based assets on an on-chain marketplace. So, effectively, every trade burns a portion of YETIO, tightening supply. Why YETIO Thrives on Ethereum? Scalable Gameplay : Thanks to some of Ethereum’s Layer 2 integrations, YetiGo transactions will happen much more swiftly and in an affordable manner. Racers can enter tournaments and trade assets without waiting minutes or paying weighty gas fees. Deflationary Design : Every YETIO transaction triggers a 5% burn, making sure that as the game grows, token scarcity intensifies. In contrast, ETH’s supply remains fixed beyond staking dynamics. Shared Security: By relying on Ethereum’s strong proof-of-stake security, YETIO avoids building its own chain. Community Support Meets Utility: Yeti Ouro’s team has partnered with top game veterans and Grammy-nominated audio producers. As Ethereum’s upgrades boost overall network value, Yeti Ouro stands to gain from upgraded visibility and smoother gameplay experiences. Conversely, YETIO’s excitement and active community can bring in new users onto Ethereum, creating a virtuous cycle. Conclusion Ethereum’s amazing comeback proves that innovation never stops. Moreover, its recent growth also shows that the value of reliable assets like BTC and ETH remains massive. At the same time, Yeti Ouro is redefining what utility means in the crypto world.

2025-05-30T13:22:54.000Z,"Panama Mayor Proposes Bitcoin Fast Pass for Canal","He pitched the idea at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. Meanwhile, in the UK, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage announced the party will accept crypto donations and introduced a pro-crypto agenda, including a potential Bitcoin reserve at the Bank of England. In Kazakhstan, President Tokayev revealed plans for “CryptoCity,” which is a regulated zone where crypto can be used for everyday purchases. The city of Alatau, known for its tech heritage, is the leading candidate to host the initiative. Overall, Panama, the UK, and Kazakhstan are each making bold moves toward deeper crypto integration. Bitcoin Could Let Cargo Ships Skip the Line Panama City Mayor Mayer Mizrachi proposed a bold new idea to integrate Bitcoin into one of the world's most vital shipping routes—the Panama Canal. At the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas on May 29, Mizrachi floated the concept of allowing cargo ships to pay in Bitcoin to receive expedited passage through the canal. He was joined by El Salvador Bitcoin advocates Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert, and the talk was moderated by Mike Peterson of Bitcoin Beach. Mizrachi suggested that Bitcoin payments could offer ships the perk of bypassing the long queue times that are often associated with the canal. The Panama Canal is a crucial man-made waterway linking the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean, and it facilitates about 5% of global maritime trade annually. It even generated $5 billion in revenue between October of 2023 and September of 2024. Over 423 million tons of goods passed through the canal in that period via nearly 10,000 transits. Panama Canal Mizrachi’s idea was floated even as the canal remains a politically charged issue, especially after President Donald Trump’s December 2024 call to reclaim US control of the canal over concerns about Chinese influence and alleged discrimination against US vessels. Panama is a crypto-forward nation, following in El Salvador’s footsteps. Mizrachi’s administration already made strides, including passing a measure to allow cryptocurrency for public payments like taxes, fines, and municipal fees. Mizrachi is also exploring the possibility of creating a Bitcoin reserve for Panama City, which he believes could be implemented without needing any legislative approval. Additionally, Mizrachi called on Panama’s lawmakers to take a laissez-faire approach to regulating cryptocurrency. He urged them to “not touch it,” and argued that the government should first let Bitcoin function organically and then determine the appropriate policy response—whether to restrict or promote it. He specifically referred to figures suggesting Panama sees over $5 billion in annual Bitcoin transactions, although much of it reportedly happens in the shadows due to fear and uncertainty around regulation. His vision is unfolding against the backdrop of domestic unrest, as Panama recently declared a state of emergency in Bocas del Toro after mass layoffs at banana giant Chiquita Brands, which claims to have suffered over $75 million in losses due to protests and blockades demanding better social protections. Mizrachi’s plans look like an attempt to both modernize Panama’s financial infrastructure and ease the country’s economic tension through bold, decentralized strategies, and Bitcoin could very likely play a central role in that future. Reform UK Now Accepts Crypto Donations Other countries are also finding new ways to utilize cryptocurrencies. Nigel Farage, the leader of the Reform UK political party, announced that the party is now accepting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for donations, becoming the first major UK political group to do so. Farage also spoke at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, and said that Reform UK will use the Radom platform to facilitate crypto donations from eligible contributors. This move places Reform ahead of both the Conservative and Labour parties, which currently dominate the UK’s House of Commons but have yet to embrace crypto contributions. Nigel Farage Farage said, “We’re way behind you in America, but as of now, people with Bitcoin can give us money provided they’re eligible.” His appearance at the conference also touched on personal experiences with being debanked in the UK in 2023, which he said proved the need for alternative financial systems. In addition to introducing crypto donations, Farage laid out a vision for digital assets in the UK, including a proposed “Cryptoassets and Digital Finance Bill” that Reform will push if it secures government control in the general election expected before August of 2029. While Reform UK currently holds only five seats in the House of Commons compared to Labour’s 403 and the Conservatives’ 120, Farage’s comments shed some light on the desire to position the party as a crypto-friendly alternative. Nigel Farage at Bitcoin 2025 Farage also advocated for the creation of a Bitcoin reserve held by the Bank of England and voiced strong opposition to the launch of a UK central bank digital currency (CBDC). He praised President Donald Trump’s stance on crypto and agreed with sentiments aligned with US pro-crypto conservatives. He pointed out that crypto ownership is widespread in the UK, and even claimed that seven million people hold digital assets, including one in four individuals under the age of 30. While the current Labour-led government proposed a framework to treat crypto exchanges and dealers similarly to traditional financial institutions, Farage’s approach suggests a more aggressive path toward national adoption and reserve integration. Kazakhstan Plans CryptoCity Pilot Meanwhile, Kazakhstan is preparing to launch “CryptoCity,” which is a pilot zone designed to allow the use of cryptocurrencies for everyday transactions. This is according to President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. At the Astana International Forum 2025 , Tokayev announced the government’s plan to create a regulated sandbox environment where digital assets could be used for purchasing goods, services, and potentially more. A transcript of his remarks was published on the official website of the presidency on May 29. President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev The initiative is a bold step in Kazakhstan’s plan to embrace digital innovation. The country recently made several moves in the crypto space, including piloting a CBDC that reportedly helped reduce wait times for value-added tax refunds. Kanysh Tuleushin, Kazakhstan’s first vice minister of digital development, publicly stated that the country has the potential to become a leading crypto hub in Central Asia, especially if regulatory hurdles are reduced. While the government is still finalizing the location for the CryptoCity pilot, Digital Development Minister Zhaslan Madiyev said the new city of Alatau is the most likely candidate. It is located near Kazakhstan’s southeastern border, and has a strong scientific and technological legacy. It was founded in 1957 to house scientific institutions and is home to the Institute of Nuclear Physics, the National Nuclear Center, and the Physics and Technology Institute. Alatau also hosts the Innovation Technology Park, which is a special economic zone that could complement the CryptoCity concept by drawing in tech-focused investment. Madiyev explained that the city would support broad crypto utility, with residents able to use digital assets for purchases in restaurants and cafes, real estate transactions, and investments.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9379/panama-mayor-proposes-bitcoin-fast-pass-for-canal,"ASIA|BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-05-30T13:21:37.000Z,"Crypto trader James Wynn just lost $100m","James Wynn, a high-stakes crypto whale, has just lost nearly $100 million in Bitcoin ( BTC ) after the asset briefly dipped below $105,000. ARKHAM ALERT: JAMES WYNN HAS JUST BEEN LIQUIDATED FOR $100 MILLION DOLLARS pic.twitter.com/dJNCUmbgZO — Arkham (@arkham) May 30, 2025 Some context: Wynn bet on a BTC rebound through Hyperliquid ( HYPE ), opening two massive long positions , one of 527.29 BTC (that’s $55.3 million) and another of 421.8 BTC (or $43.9 million). But when Bitcoin dropped to a 10-day low, his positions were liquidated. What’s worse, a separate position of 94 BTC ($10 million) was also liquidated just yesterday. That’s a total of 949 BTC, or $99.3 million, gone with the wind within a week. Crypto trader Wynn has no regrets A self-professed “degenerate trader”, Wynn has quite a history with crypto, with the last three months being almost incredible, as he’s gone from $82 million in profits only to losing $100 million. After his PEPE moves in April, which led to $25 million in profits, Wynn started going long on BTC, opening a $500+ million position. Afterwards, he opened a $1 billion BTC short , which he closed at a $1 million loss. Things were looking great for Wynn. After all, his profit and loss (P&L) grew from $30 million to almost $82 million. But, as we’re now aware, Wynn flew too close to the sun, as BTC hit his liquidation price and bounced. While he’s just been liquidated for what amounts to more or less five decently sized mansions, Wynn appears to have no regrets. He tweeted: The perps casino was fun. Zero regrets. Flipping $4m to $100m and back down to -$13m is one hell of a thrill. Hope many of you enjoyed it as much as I did. Most wouldn’t dare or dream to place these kind of trades. Well, they can’t, they don’t have the money to do so, nor the… — James Wynn 🐳 (@JamesWynnReal) May 30, 2025 And he’s not just talking the talk. Just hours later, Wynn opened a new $12 million long position on PEPE on Hyperliquid. He now holds 934 million PEPE tokens, a position that’s ensured an unrealized gain of 10.66% .

2025-05-30T13:20:20.000Z,"Bitcoin Enters Consolidation Phase Amid Tariff Ruling and Market Uncertainty","Bitcoin may be entering a sideways trading phase following a recent surge and new geopolitical developments, but analysts suggest that this isn’t a bearish shift. Rather, they believe it’s a natural cooldown after a strong rally. According to Nick Forster, founder of onchain options protocol Derive, the cryptocurrency is currently “digesting recent gains,” and the consolidation is likely a “healthy pause” before a potential fresh rally. Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of $111,970 on May 22 but has since pulled back to around $105,976 as of the time of writing, data from CoinMarketCap shows. The digital asset remains up 11.59% over the past month, despite recent fluctuations. “We are likely in a phase where price stability will dominate the short term,” Forster stated in an interview , adding that this phase helps “gear up for the next movement.” Trade Tariff Ruling and Fed Decision A key macro factor influencing market sentiment is the U.S. Court of International Trade’s recent decision on May 28 to strike down President Donald Trump’s broad tariff policies, ruling that he exceeded his authority. However, the following day, the Court of Appeals temporarily allowed the tariffs to stay in place under an emergency powers law while Trump appeals the ruling. Forster said the initial ruling relieved fears about trade-induced inflation, potentially giving Bitcoin some breathing room. However, all eyes are now on the U.S. Federal Reserve’s next interest rate announcement, scheduled for June 18. “The Fed’s decision will be pivotal in shaping short-term market direction,” he noted. Q3 Could Defy Historical Weakness Looking ahead, Forster suggested that the third quarter—which has traditionally been weaker for Bitcoin—may play out differently this year. “Favorable regulatory news and rising institutional interest could flip the script,” he said. Since 2013, Q3 has posted an average 6.03% gain for Bitcoin, while Q4 remains the standout performer with an average return of 85.42%, according to CoinGlass. One overlooked factor, Forster added, is the substantial yet understated impact of spot Bitcoin ETF inflows. “Over $6.2 billion flowed into BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust in May alone,” he pointed out. Yet, Bitcoin’s spot price hasn’t shown a proportional move. This, he explained, is because many ETF investors are institutions opting for indirect exposure, which doesn’t immediately pressure spot markets. In the final week ending May 23, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $2.75 billion in inflows —highlighting strong undercurrents despite the apparent market calm.

The moment sparked buzz across crypto Twitter and brought fresh attention to the Trump family’s growing support for digital assets. With Trump Jr. saying he’s “fully out of politics” and ready to focus on crypto, some are now asking: is political influence TRON’s new edge in the U.S.? Finally meet in person @DonaldJTrumpJr !

Justin Sun (@justinsuntron) May 29, 2025 Trump’s allies are increasingly promoting pro-crypto ideas , including a national Bitcoin reserve and looser rules for stablecoins. For TRON, which has faced years of pressure from U.S. regulators, this photo-op signals possible momentum. TRX 2025 Momentum: Growth by the Numbers Beyond the political headlines, TRON and TRX are showing strong performance in 2025. Over half of all Tether (USDT), around $73.8 billion, is now hosted on TRON’s network . Tether has minted $16 billion in new USDT on TRON just this year. TRON has emerged as the leading blockchain for global stablecoin payments, according to @CryptoQuant_com #TRON #USDT https://t.co/bev3Ntky1D — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 19, 2025 A May 28 main-net upgrade further enhanced performance ahead of a Q3 overhaul focused on fast finality and ARM-native nodes. TRON has also boosted retail accessibility. A new MoonPay partnership now lets U.S. users buy TRX with debit cards in minutes, directly targeting the same demographic that a Trump-branded crypto push might energize. From a revenue standpoint, Q1 2025 marked a record-setting $760 million, with daily active addresses reaching 2.4 million. These milestones support the argument that TRON’s traction isn’t just hype-driven, it’s built on utility and user growth. Then came Sun’s cryptic May 30 tweet, simply captioned “Progress.” Progress. https://t.co/YMEY0EfD8f — H.E. Justin Sun (@justinsuntron) May 30, 2025 The single-word post triggered a 15% spike in transaction volume and pushed TRX to $0.1115, up 1.2% on the day. Binance’s TRX/USDT pair rose 2.1% within hours, while the TRX/BTC pair also gained. Volume surged 18% across major exchanges, and the token broke above its 50-day moving average, further strengthening short-term bullish sentiment. Trump-Era Alliances: Simple Breakdown of the Risks and Rewards Justin Sun’s ties to Donald Trump Jr. are more than a publicity move. Sun is a big holder of the $TRUMP memecoin and now advises the Trump family’s crypto venture, giving him direct access to policymakers who are suddenly friendlier toward digital assets Tron founder @justinsuntron has received a Trump-branded Golden Tourbillon watch for being the top holder of President @realDonaldTrump ’s memecoin. #Trump #Sun https://t.co/NI4bVy3smJ — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 23, 2025 As a result of being the top holder of President Donald Trump’s memecoin, he received a Trump-branded Golden Tourbillon watch during the exclusive dinner hosted by Donald Trump. Some critics call this a conflict of interest, but the timing matters: the SEC has recently dropped or settled cases against Coinbase, ConsenSys, Kraken, Circle, and Immutable. With regulators easing off, TRON might also win relief, especially with Sun pushing for approval of a TRON ETF and clearer DeFi rules. The SEC’s softer stance is already visible. In February 2025, the agency told a federal judge it was in talks to pause its civil fraud lawsuit against Sun and his companies (Tron Foundation, BitTorrent Foundation, and Rainberry). The case, filed in 2023, had accused Sun of illegally distributing TRX and BTT tokens and boosting trading volumes with hidden celebrity endorsements. A pause could lead to a settlement, underscoring how Sun’s political connections may turn regulatory risk into opportunity.

2025-05-30T13:14:56.000Z,"Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Is Set to Reach Record High Amid Surging Hashrate","Bitcoin BTC mining difficulty is on track to reach a new all-time high sometime around midnight UTC in a sign of increased participation by miners that makes the blockchain more secure. The adjustment is likely to finalize within the next 100 blocks, with projections showing the measure will rise about 4% to 126.95 trillion (T), eclipsing the current 123 T record. Difficulty was 109 T at the start of the year, according to Coinwarz . The increase reflects growing long-term confidence in bitcoin’s value, even as on-chain activity and transaction fees remain low. Difficulty is adjusted every 2,016 blocks, and is driven by the network hashrate, which measures the total computational power dedicated to securing the network. The hashrate's seven-day moving average is now 918 exahashes per second (EH/s), having risen from 840 (EH/s) over the past two weeks. With previous peaks at 925 EH/s, any further increase would mark a new record high in hashrate. Despite the increase in mining activity, transaction fees remain exceptionally low. A high-priority transaction currently requires only 2 satoshis per virtual byte (sat/vB), equating to roughly $0.30. The higher the fee, the faster a transaction will be confirmed, as miners prioritize transactions that pay more. These figures suggest that while transaction demand on the Bitcoin network is subdued, mining power continues to scale to new heights, highlighting a divergence between usage and infrastructure growth.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/30/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-is-set-to-reach-record-high-amid-surging-hashrate,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|MINING","Markets|Hashrate|Bitcoin|Mining Difficulty|News",cryptocompare

2025-05-30T13:00:52.000Z,"Shiba Inu Takes A Major Leap As ShibDAO Decentralizes Power","The Shiba Inu ecosystem has officially taken a major step towards full decentralization with the launch of ShibDAO. On May 29, 2025, Shibarium Updates (@Shibizens) announced via X that the long-awaited transition to community-driven governance has commenced. With the Shiba Inu community now in control, ShibDAO aims to eliminate centralized decision-making and give power directly to those who stake the Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bone (BONE), Leash (LEASH), and Treat (TREAT) tokens. Shiba Inu’s Next Chapter “Breaking: ShibDAO Officially Live — Community Governance Begins,” the announcement states. ShibDAO’s launch opens the door for true decentralization in Shiba Inu’s vast ecosystem, providing community members with both voting power and direct influence over the project’s future. Key features of ShibDAO’s decentralized governance system include on-chain staking, off-chain voting, and the delegation system. The on-chain staking function, introduced as Bury 2.0, allows users to stake SHIB, BONE, LEASH , or TREAT tokens to gain influence. The more tokens users stake and the longer they maintain their stakes, the more voting power they accumulate, strengthening their voice within the governance process. As of now, no staking rewards are active, with the current phase focused solely on governance participation. Off-chain voting has been integrated into the system through Snapshot, where community members can propose changes and vote without incurring any gas fees. Real-time on-chain staking data directly influences vote outcomes, ensuring that voting power is dynamically linked to participants’ actual investments in the ecosystem. “ShibDAO has launched, marking a major step toward real decentralization across the SHIB ecosystem. No more backroom deals — this system gives voice and power to the community,” @Shibizens announced. For those who lack the time or inclination to vote directly, ShibDAO offers a delegation system. This allows token holders to delegate their governance power to trusted community leaders, with the ability to retract their delegation at any time. This flexible system ensures that even those who cannot actively participate can still influence the project’s trajectory through trusted representatives. Additionally, ShibDAO introduces the DAO Factory, which enables users to launch their own decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) within the Shiba Inu ecosystem. This feature allows anyone to create DAOs for a range of purposes, including gaming, art, decentralized finance (DeFi), or public goods, further decentralizing the platform’s structure. Currently, four distinct DAOs are operational within the Shiba Inu ecosystem: Shiba Inu DAO, the official central hub for social governance, where veSHIB stakers lead initiatives in community events, charity, UX upgrades, and public good funding. Second, there’s the Bone DAO, focused on Shibarium ’s technological evolution, with veBONE stakers overseeing upgrades, contract changes, network improvements, and technical integrations. Third, there’s the Leash DAO which acts as Shibarium’s judiciary, with veLEASH stakers resolving disputes, arbitrating conflicts, and handling governance litigations. Finally, the Treat DAO is dedicated to innovation, with veTREAT stakers funding new products, dApps, research, and business proposals to drive expansion and innovation within Shiba Inu’s ecosystem. Notably, the Bury 2.0 beta is currently live and active, marking just the beginning of ShibDAO’s journey toward full decentralization. At press time, SHIB traded at $0.00001337.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shibdao/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Shiba Inu|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu DAO|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|Shibarium|ShibDAO",cryptocompare

The RSI is above 50, reflecting building momentum. Price is trading above the 9-day SMA, suggesting bullish sentiment. Consolidation at the current $180 range may precede a breakout. Watch for resistance near $193, a push above which could take the SOL price to $220. The start of an altseason could take SOL to $250 by the end of June.

On the other hand, as per CoinGlass , the open interest against the price is at $7.44 billion. These strong on-chain metrics could play a pivotal role in pushing the SOL price to greater highs. If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400. Conversely, stricter regulations or a network congestion setback could pull the price toward its annual low of $250. Considering the present market sentiment, the SOL crypto could settle with an average trading price of around $325.

2025-05-30T12:50:57.000Z,"Fastex Unleashes Ambitious Expansion into US Crypto Market via Los Angeles","BitcoinWorld Fastex Unleashes Ambitious Expansion into US Crypto Market via Los Angeles Get ready, America! A major player from the global crypto scene is making its way stateside. Fastex, a prominent crypto exchange headquartered in the bustling financial hub of Dubai, has officially announced its strategic entry into the US crypto market . This isn’t just a soft launch; it’s a significant move marked by the opening of a brand-new office right in the heart of Los Angeles. This expansion signals Fastex’s intent to capture a share of the dynamic and ever-evolving American digital asset landscape. Fastex Enters the US Crypto Market: What Does This Mean? The move by Fastex into the United States is a bold step, highlighting the exchange’s global ambitions. While details are still emerging, the core plan involves providing spot trading services to customers across the U.S. This means users will be able to buy and sell cryptocurrencies directly at current market prices. The initial focus appears to be on established digital assets, alongside their own native token. Entering the US crypto market is a complex undertaking. It requires navigating a patchwork of state and federal regulations, obtaining necessary licenses, and establishing a robust operational presence. The choice of Los Angeles as the base of operations is strategic, positioning Fastex in a major economic and technological hub on the West Coast. What Spot Trading Services Will Fastex Offer in Los Angeles? According to initial reports, the Fastex platform will initially offer spot trading for several key assets: Bitcoin (BTC): The undisputed king of cryptocurrencies, offering high liquidity and broad market interest. Ethereum (ETH): The leading smart contract platform, crucial for DeFi, NFTs, and much more. Fasttoken (FTN): Fastex’s native ecosystem token, which likely offers users benefits within the Fastex ecosystem, such as trading fee discounts or access to special features. Offering Bitcoin Ethereum and their own token provides a solid foundation for their US operations. Spot trading is the most common way for individuals to interact with crypto, making it a logical starting point for a new crypto exchange US entry. Navigating the US Crypto Exchange Landscape The United States already has a crowded market of crypto exchanges, from major players like Coinbase and Kraken to smaller, specialized platforms. Fastex will need to differentiate itself to attract users. Key factors for success in this competitive environment include: Regulatory Compliance: Adhering strictly to U.S. regulations is paramount for long-term sustainability and user trust. User Experience: Providing an intuitive, reliable, and secure platform is essential. Competitive Fees: Offering attractive trading fees can draw in volume. Customer Support: Responsive and effective support is crucial, especially for new users. Asset Variety (Future): While starting with key assets, expanding the list over time will be important. Establishing a physical presence in Los Angeles could help Fastex build local relationships and better understand the specific needs of the American market. The Significance of Los Angeles for Fastex Why Los Angeles ? This city isn’t just a cultural capital; it’s a growing tech and finance hub. Its strategic location on the West Coast provides a gateway to the broader US market and is home to a significant population of potential crypto users and investors. Setting up an office here demonstrates a serious commitment to building a presence within the United States. The move to Los Angeles is more than just opening a door; it’s about planting roots in a key region for the US crypto market . It allows Fastex to be closer to its potential customer base and potentially recruit local talent familiar with the nuances of the American financial and technological landscape. What Are the Potential Benefits for US Users? The arrival of a new crypto exchange US option like Fastex could bring several benefits to American users: Increased Competition: More exchanges mean more choices and potentially better services and lower fees for consumers. New Platform Features: Fastex may offer unique features or a different user interface compared to existing platforms. Access to Fasttoken: Users interested in the Fastex ecosystem will have direct access to trade Fasttoken on a US-compliant platform. Global Perspective: As a Dubai-based exchange, Fastex brings an international perspective that could enrich the US market. While challenges exist in entering a regulated market, the potential upside for both Fastex and US users is considerable. The availability of key assets like Bitcoin Ethereum from a new provider adds more liquidity and options to the market. Challenges and the Road Ahead Entering the US crypto market is not without its hurdles. Regulatory clarity remains an ongoing process in the U.S., and compliance costs can be significant. Building brand recognition and trust in a market dominated by established players will also require substantial effort and investment from Fastex . The success of Fastex’s venture in Los Angeles will depend on their ability to effectively navigate these challenges, secure the necessary licenses across various states, and build a platform that meets the high expectations of American crypto traders. Offering reliable spot trading for assets like Bitcoin Ethereum is just the first step. In Conclusion: A New Chapter for Fastex and the US Market Fastex’s expansion into the United States, marked by the opening of its Los Angeles office, represents a significant development for the Dubai-based exchange and adds another dynamic player to the competitive US crypto market . By initially focusing on popular assets like Bitcoin Ethereum and offering spot trading services, Fastex is laying the groundwork for its American operations. While the journey ahead involves navigating regulatory complexities and building a user base, this move underscores the continued global growth of the cryptocurrency industry and the attractiveness of the U.S. market despite its regulatory challenges. Crypto enthusiasts in the U.S. now have another platform to potentially explore for their trading needs, bringing a touch of Dubai’s crypto ambition to the Californian coast.

2025-05-30T12:41:20.000Z,"Asset Entities: The First Publicly Traded Asset Management Bitcoin Treasury For $8 Per Share -- Strong Buy","Summary I'm initiating a Strong Buy rating on Asset Entities due to its massive $750M PIPE funding and transformative merger with Strive Asset Management. The company is evolving from a social media tech play into a diversified entity targeting distressed Bitcoin assets and undervalued biotech firms. Institutional investors are buying in at a 121% premium, signaling strong confidence; I expect a short-term upside to $12-13 as momentum builds. Volatility will remain high, but with the new funding secured, I see a compelling short-term opportunity for investors at the current $8 level. Investment Thesis Asset Entities ( ASST ) is a very volatile stock, trading at less than $8 last week, hitting $12 just a few days ago, and now hovering around $8.10 per share. Equally important, however, is that it's a stock with a lot of good news. I'm here to explain the risk-reward profile of Asset Entities and Strive Asset Management, which merged earlier this month. From where I'm standing, I think there's a lot more upside to this stock in the mid-term. Asset Entities is, according to their bio, \""a technology company [that] provides social media marketing and content delivery services across Discord, TikTok, and other social media platforms.\"" This means their revenue is pretty diversified, and they are expanding into a new area that I expect will bring substantial growth after the merger with Strive Asset Management, which is a subsidiary of Strive Enterprises, Inc. The reason is that these two are becoming a single entity that aims to be the first public Bitcoin Treasury Company. Below is the post on X from Strive Asset Management's CFO, Ben Pham, emphasizing just how big a deal this is. X Before this merger deal, Asset Entities was recognized as the first publicly traded company centered around Discord communities. It has a flagship product called the \""AE.360.DDM\"", which offers customers design, development, and management services for Discord servers. This kind of product caters to businesses, influencers, and educational communities, basically anyone looking to gain a heads-up on social media. Additionally, the company provides \""Ternary\"", a Stripe-verified CRM and payment platform. They offer these services on other platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and X, not just Discord. Their financials, however, aren't the prettiest. Their Q1'25 revenue was $170,749, a 36.8% increase from $124,841 in Q1 2024. Operating Expenses were $1.83 million, up 20.9% year-over-year. Management states this is driven by higher advertising, marketing, payroll, and administrative costs, which makes sense for such a small company trying to grow. The market already reacted pretty well to the merger when it happened back around May 7th, with the stock up 1,240% since then, which you can see clearly in the chart below of the stock against the S&P 500 over the past month. YChart But, this Tuesday the stock dropped almost 22%, and investors, seeing the volatility, are all wondering: Is this the time to buy the pullback or stay on the sidelines? So, I'm here to give my take, especially in light of the latest transitions underway, the main of which is the following: [Strive Asset Management and Asset Entities] announced the signing of a $750 million private investment in public equity ((PIPE)), with an additional $750 million in potential financing available upon the exercise of warrants, which could increase total potential proceeds to $1.5 billion . To put that into context, we're talking about a massive merger deal with the money coming from a group of private institutional investors. What this tells me is that there are some big-money players who are very confident in the future of the stock. Since this merger has taken another step in the right direction, securing a great amount of funds and directing those funds for growth, I will initiate my coverage of Asset Entities with a buy. What's the new deal? In early May, Strive Asset Management and Asset Entities Inc. announced their merger, causing the stock to skyrocket 1,320% over the past month, and today, May 28th, they secured $750 million in new funding. To put this in context, Asset Entities only made $633,000 in revenue for the whole of 2024. So, where's all this money coming from? Well, there's a group of investors operating through something called a Private Investment in Public Equity ((PIPE)). Now, think of a PIPE as a quick way for public companies to raise money from their private investors, and keep in mind these private investors aren't like you and me; they have millions to invest. In this case, these investors are buying Asset Entities' shares at $1.35 per share. That's good news for people like us, as it's 121% higher than what the stock was trading at before the merger announcement. What this tells me is that these investors have huge confidence in this new deal. On top of this, there's also the potential for another $750 million to come in if investors choose to exercise warrants. Now, these warrants are like options to buy more shares later, which would bring the total investment to $1.5 billion. If that happens, you should buckle your seatbelts. So why the need to raise all these funds? Strive Asset Management is planning on merging with Asset Entities Inc. to create a new kind of public company: one focused on a few new money-making ideas. The $750 million is set to fund the merged entity's new strategic plan, to buy distressed Bitcoin assets as well as scoop up any undervalued biotech firms. Matt Cole, CEO of Strive Asset, seems bullish, saying traditional Bitcoin investors rely mainly on price ratios like price-to-NAV. But he's looking to head in a new direction when it comes to valuing Bitcoin investments. These new methods are said to be based on fundamentals and smart acquisitions, not just tracking Bitcoin's price. Since the PIPE is injecting all this cash, the new entity has no debt; if it stumbles across a struggling bitcoin company, it can move in quickly. What this means for investors is that Asset Entities is essentially expanding its revenue stream. It's no longer just a social/digital media tech business, but now has a financial engineering play in crypto and special situations investing. Expect Volatility Since these new PIPE shares come from institutional players, they sweep in and buy shares at a discounted price, in this case $1.35 a share. This is a 121% premium to Asset Entities' pre-merger price, but there's a catch. These shares will be restricted at first and can't be sold by the investors straight away, there's going to be some kind of lockup period on the shares, although we don't know exactly how long this is. In my opinion and historically, this lock-up period on the shares should be at least 3 months. So we can expect some stock volatility in that period but an overall upward trend. My reasoning for this is simple: the stock is up 1,335% over the past month, there's huge momentum here, and I expect it to keep going off the back of the new funds secured. On top of this, yesterday we saw a 21% drop in the stock price, which, I believe, is due to investors not fully understanding what this deal means for Asset Management. Also, I know what you're thinking: can those institutional investors sell off their shares immediately after that lock-up period is over? Well, the answer is, they can. However, they have at least a 3-month period in which they're bullish on the stock going up, so why can we jump on that train too? This also works as a short-term investment for me with a big upside. A Rollercoaster Ride This May So, a month ago, this was just a penny stock, trading at $0.63, and has since hit a high of $13 per share. The good news of the merger got well priced into the stock, and then between May 9th and May 14th, things calmed down with the stock dropping 40%. I think investors started reaping profits and selling off their shares. At this point, the stock started facing resistance around $5; investors knew there was something more here. At this point, only the news of the merger was out, and the funds for buying Bitcoin had not yet been secured. Despite the sell-off on May 9th, the stock pulled through, skyrocketing another 176%, hitting a high of $13 last Thursday. I'm bullish because the stock has fallen off 40% since that high, and you can pick up shares for $8. What makes me particularly bullish is this new bit of news I've just explained: they've secured the funding. I don't think investors fully understand what this PIPE investment does for Asset Entities. What it does is show huge confidence in their new entity to buy Bitcoin and make a huge upside. In the short term, I expect the stock to shoot up and recover to that $12-13 range it was before. Valuation The market cap is at $129 million, there's been a 52-week low of $0.34 and a high of $13, which goes to show you really how volatile this stock is right now. Because Asset Entities is expanding into Bitcoin and other revenue streams, it is hard to place them among competitors. Seeking Alpha compares them to peers such as Cardlytics Inc. ( CDLX ) and Marchex Inc. (MCHX), both advertising and analytics tech companies. These would be accurate peers before this merger, but now Asset Entities finds itself in a new ballgame. The RSI right now is at 53, and on its way down fast. This is the time to buy for investors, in my opinion. I think the $8 range is a good entry point for those looking to make a quick upside on the stock. What's Next Investors should be following the stock daily; we should see an upside this week from the news that funds have been raised for the new merger, and the stock is already showing signs, up 13% on Thursday so far. Those institutional investors are bullish, and so am I. Over the next few months, keep a lookout for any news on Asset Entities acquiring small biotech firms and any big Bitcoin investments. These will eventually be the new catalysts going forward.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4791176-asset-entities-1st-asset-management-public-bitcoin-treasury-for-8-per-share?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","ASST",cryptocompare
2025-05-30T12:40:59.000Z,"Expert Predicts Timeline for XRP to Disappear from Exchanges","The XRP community is closely monitoring recent forecasts suggesting a potential XRP supply shortage on cryptocurrency exchanges. According to Edoardo Farina, founder of Alpha Lions Academy and a prominent XRP advocate, this shift could greatly reduce the availability of XRP for public trading with a definite timeline. XRP’s Recent Price Movement Triggers Supply Concerns XRP has struggled to maintain its upward momentum following its surge to $3.30 in mid-January 2025. Since reaching that peak, the asset has been trading largely within the lower $2 range, showing limited signs of recovery. This stagnant performance has caused concern among holders, especially as Bitcoin and other leading assets continue to achieve new all-time highs. Despite this, Farina believes XRP is still capable of a significant rally. In a recent post, he emphasized that a major driver of this potential rise could be a supply shock, a situation where the number of available tokens on exchanges becomes insufficient to meet demand. Farina Projects Supply Shock by 2030 Farina has proposed that a substantial drop in XRP availability on exchanges could occur by 2030. He argues that this supply limitation would make it increasingly difficult for investors to acquire the asset, potentially fueling a price surge. According to him, the foundation for this future scenario is already forming. $XRP might DISAPPEAR from exchanges by 2030. Screenshot this. — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) May 28, 2025 Decline in XRP Reserves on Binance Supporting this outlook, data from the on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant reveals a consistent decline in XRP reserves on Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges. Since the beginning of 2025, the number of XRP held on Binance has fallen from 2.939 billion to 2.857 billion, a reduction of 82 million tokens. While this change may appear marginal in percentage terms, it signals a downward trend in the availability of XRP on centralized platforms. Crypto analyst EgyHash highlighted this movement in a prior analysis, noting that reserves had reached their lowest levels since July 2024. The decline was particularly sharp following XRP’s rise to $3.30 in mid-January. Binance reserves peaked at 3.040 billion tokens on January 16, coinciding with XRP’s local high. This likely resulted from investors transferring their assets to exchanges to take profits. Since then, the reserve has decreased by over 180 million tokens, fluctuating throughout February and March. Comparisons to Bitcoin’s Supply Dynamics Farina and other analysts have compared XRP’s evolving supply trend to Bitcoin’s historical performance. In BTC’s case, consistent buying pressure from institutions and ETFs has significantly reduced its available float, contributing to recent price increases. A similar effect could occur with XRP if exchange reserves continue to decline. Additionally, the ongoing token burn from transaction fees may further reduce the circulating supply, compounding the potential for a future shortage. Despite recent price stagnation, some analysts maintain a bullish outlook. Sistine Research previously projected a price range of $33 to $50 for XRP, citing favourable long-term trends and reduced market supply. If Farina’s forecast materializes and a supply shock occurs, the resulting scarcity may significantly impact XRP’s valuation over the next few years.

2025-05-30T12:30:02.000Z,"Ethereum Daily Gas Usage Hits New Highs – Real Demand Powers ETH Growth","Ethereum is experiencing increased volatility as it consolidates just below the key $2,700 resistance level. Despite several attempts to break above it in recent weeks, ETH has yet to secure a daily close above this threshold, making it a crucial battleground for bulls and bears alike. The broader market remains uncertain, but Ethereum’s fundamentals continue to show strength beneath the surface. Related Reading: Ethereum Tests Key Weekly Resistance – Analyst Sets $4K Target If ETH Breaks Out Top analyst Ted Pillows shared compelling insights on X, highlighting that Ethereum’s daily gas usage has been climbing steadily since 2016. This long-term rise suggests that Ethereum’s network activity is not just driven by short-term speculation or hype, but by real and growing demand. It’s a sign that users, developers, and applications are increasingly relying on ETH as the backbone of Web3 infrastructure. Ethereum’s ability to maintain this level of on-chain usage through bear and bull markets reinforces its role as the foundation of decentralized finance, NFTs, and smart contracts. While short-term price action remains capped below $2,700, the underlying demand tells a bullish story. If ETH can break above this level with conviction, it may signal the beginning of a broader move to retest higher resistance levels. Ethereum Fundamentals Are Strong As It Prepares For A Move Ethereum is facing a critical test as it consolidates below major resistance, struggling to reclaim key levels above the $2,700 mark. Bulls have maintained strong support over the past few sessions, but momentum has yet to trigger a breakout. As global tensions remain high and US Treasury yields continue to rise, risk assets—including cryptocurrencies—are under pressure. However, Ethereum appears poised for an expansive move, with technical and on-chain data supporting a potential breakout. Pillows highlighted that Ethereum’s daily gas usage has continued to climb steadily since 2016, reinforcing the view that ETH demand is structural and not just a product of market hype. This metric serves as a proxy for real activity on the Ethereum network, suggesting that despite short-term price hurdles, usage and value creation persist. Pillows believes this persistent demand positions ETH for a strong recovery once key technical levels are breached. Sentiment across the broader crypto space is gradually shifting bullish, especially with Bitcoin hovering near its all-time high. If Ethereum can reclaim and close above the $2,700–$2,800 resistance zone, it could open the door for a sharp rally toward $3,000 and beyond. Related Reading: Ethereum Spot Premium Signals Strength – $2,800 Resistance In Focus ETH Consolidates Below Key Resistance Ethereum is currently trading at $2,617, consolidating just below the critical $2,700–$2,800 resistance zone. This area has acted as a major barrier since early February, and despite several breakout attempts, ETH has failed to close above it with strong conviction. The chart shows a clear bullish structure, with the price holding above key moving averages: the 34 EMA at $2,366, and the 50, 100, and 200 SMAs all trending upward and providing layered support between $2,070 and $2,690. The recent consolidation comes after a strong rally in May that pushed ETH above its 200-day SMA for the first time in months, signaling a major shift in momentum. However, volume has started to taper off slightly, which could indicate hesitation from bulls at current levels. A decisive daily close above $2,800 would likely confirm the breakout and open the door for a move toward the $3,000–$3,200 range. Related Reading: Altseason Loading? Analyst Explains How FTX $5B Distribution May Trigger The Next Bull Leg Until then, the price remains range-bound, with $2,550 acting as near-term support.

All eyes are now on whether Ethereum can break through the ceiling that has capped it for weeks, and potentially kickstart a broader altcoin rally.

On-Chain Experts Warn of Key Signals! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin’s price is hovering near $106,000 after an incredible run that pushed it to new all-time highs. However, according to on-chain analyst Willy Woo, we’re now at a crucial point that could decide whether Bitcoin’s rally will keep going strong or if we’re in for a pause. Let’s dig deeper into what this could mean for Bitcoin’s next move and why traders should stay alert. Buyers Still in Control – But for How Long? According to Willy Woo’s update, the good news is that the Risk Signal is trending downwards. This usually points to strong buy-side liquidity in the market, meaning that, overall, investors are still eager to buy and hold Bitcoin. Woo says this sets the stage for another solid, long-term run higher. In the short term my main concern are the late comer speculators taking long positions while an immense amount of potential profit taking is ready to dump (SOPR). This week's spot buying will strongly influence the next 1-2 months of price action. We are in a pivot zone. pic.twitter.com/JVJfxVXcKU — Willy Woo (@woonomic) May 28, 2025 However, Woo also sees early warning signs. He says that the strength of Bitcoin’s surge from $75,000 to $112,000 is starting to weaken. Without a new wave of buying, Bitcoin could be in for another period of sideways trading. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin risk Signal chart also shows local risk levels ticking up, signaling that some traders are taking on more risk, just as profit-takers might be ready to sell. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Is Bitcoin Overtaking US Treasuries?

2025-05-30T12:20:03.000Z,"Stacks Ecosystem Funding: Ambitious SIP-031 Proposal Seeks STX Endowment","BitcoinWorld Stacks Ecosystem Funding: Ambitious SIP-031 Proposal Seeks STX Endowment The Stacks ecosystem, a pioneering layer-2 solution bringing smart contracts and decentralized applications to Bitcoin, is buzzing with discussion following a significant new proposal. Aimed squarely at supercharging development and adoption, this initiative could reshape how resources are allocated within the network. Let’s dive into the details of the Stacks Ecosystem Funding proposal, known as SIP-031, and what it means for the future of Bitcoin Layer-2. What is the Stacks SIP-031 Proposal? Published on May 27th on the Stacks forum, SIP-031 is a comprehensive plan designed to create a dedicated STX ecosystem endowment. Think of it as a centralized fund specifically purposed to fuel growth, innovation, and infrastructure within the Stacks network. The proposal outlines a multi-pronged approach to building this treasury, primarily through transfers from existing entities within the ecosystem and, notably, through a temporary adjustment to the network’s token economics. How Will the Crypto Endowment Be Funded? Understanding STX Token Emissions The proposed endowment wouldn’t appear out of thin air. SIP-031 details two primary funding mechanisms: Transfers from Existing Entities: This involves consolidating resources currently held by various foundations or groups associated with the Stacks ecosystem into the new endowment. Increased STX Token Emissions: This is perhaps the most discussed aspect. The proposal calls for a temporary increase in the annual issuance of STX tokens over the next five years. Currently, the annual STX emission rate is around 3.52%. SIP-031 suggests raising this average rate to approximately 5.75% for this defined period. It’s crucial to understand that this is proposed as a temporary measure to quickly capitalize the endowment, with emissions expected to return to baseline levels thereafter. This adjustment to STX Token Emissions is central to the plan’s ambition. This strategic increase in token emissions is designed to provide the endowment with substantial capital upfront, enabling it to make significant investments in the ecosystem’s future. Why is This Stacks Ecosystem Funding Initiative Necessary? Addressing Key Challenges The proposal doesn’t just appear randomly; it’s a direct response to identified challenges hindering the Stacks ecosystem’s full potential. The authors of SIP-031 highlight several critical issues: Underfunding Relative to Competitors: Despite its unique position as a Bitcoin layer, Stacks has faced challenges in securing comparable levels of funding and resources seen in other layer-1 or layer-2 ecosystems. This limits its ability to compete effectively for talent and projects. Operational Fragmentation: Resources and initiatives are currently spread across various entities, leading to potential inefficiencies and lack of coordinated effort. A consolidated endowment aims to streamline this. Limited Access to Growth Tools: Developers and projects within Stacks sometimes lack access to the sophisticated tools, grants, and support structures available in better-funded ecosystems. Insufficient Resources for Developers: Attracting and retaining top-tier developers requires competitive grants, bounties, and infrastructure support, areas where the ecosystem needs strengthening. By creating a robust Stacks Ecosystem Funding mechanism, the proposal seeks to directly tackle these hurdles, providing the necessary capital and structure to accelerate development. What are the Potential Benefits for Bitcoin Layer-2 Growth? A well-funded and strategically managed endowment could unlock significant potential for Stacks and, by extension, contribute substantially to overall Bitcoin Layer-2 Growth . The benefits could include: Faster Development Cycles: Increased funding can support core protocol development, tooling, and infrastructure improvements at a much quicker pace. Attracting Top Talent: Competitive grants and bounties can incentivize developers and researchers to build on Stacks. Supporting Key Projects: The endowment can provide crucial funding for promising dApps, DeFi protocols, and NFT platforms building on Stacks. Enhanced Marketing and Adoption Efforts: Resources can be allocated to educational initiatives, marketing campaigns, and partnerships to drive user adoption. Improved Ecosystem Coordination: A central fund can help align various ecosystem participants towards common goals. Ultimately, the success of this endowment could solidify Stacks’ position as a leading platform for innovation on Bitcoin. What Happens Next with the Stacks SIP-031 Proposal? Proposals in decentralized ecosystems like Stacks follow a specific process to ensure community consensus. For Stacks SIP-031 , the next steps are clearly defined: Community Feedback: The proposal is currently open for discussion on the Stacks forum, allowing anyone in the community to provide input, raise concerns, and suggest modifications. This feedback phase is crucial for refining the proposal. Committee Setup: A dedicated committee will likely be formed to review the feedback, potentially revise the proposal, and prepare it for a formal vote. Voting: The final decision rests with the STX token holders, who will vote on whether to approve or reject the proposal. The outcome of this vote will determine if the STX ecosystem endowment becomes a reality. This community-driven process ensures that significant changes like adjusting STX Token Emissions and establishing a large Crypto Endowment are made with the broad support of the network’s participants. Considering the Implications: Risks and Rewards While the potential benefits for Bitcoin Layer-2 Growth are substantial, it’s also important to consider potential downsides. The temporary increase in STX Token Emissions , for instance, could lead to short-term inflationary pressure, although the long-term benefits of a well-funded ecosystem are argued to outweigh this. Governance of the endowment will also be critical to ensure funds are allocated transparently and effectively for the benefit of the entire Stacks community. The success of this Stacks Ecosystem Funding initiative hinges on careful planning, transparent execution, and continued community oversight. Summary: A Bold Step for Stacks The SIP-031 proposal represents a bold and ambitious plan to address critical funding and coordination challenges within the Stacks ecosystem. By proposing the creation of a significant Crypto Endowment , funded in part through a temporary adjustment to STX Token Emissions and consolidation of existing resources, Stacks aims to accelerate Bitcoin Layer-2 Growth and development. The path forward involves crucial community discussion and ultimately, a vote by STX holders on the future of Stacks Ecosystem Funding . This process highlights the decentralized nature of the network and the importance of community participation in shaping its destiny.

2025-05-30T12:19:07.000Z,"JUST IN!  New Development in US-China Tariff Agreement: Trump Made a Statement! Bitcoin (BTC) and Altcoins Dropped!","US President Donald Trump said in a statement on his Truth Social account that China has violated its agreement with the United States. “Two weeks ago China was in serious economic danger! The very high Tariffs I imposed have made it nearly impossible for China to TRADE into the United States market, which is by far the number one market in the World. I made a QUICK DEAL with China to save them from what I thought would be a very bad situation and I didn't want that to happen. Thanks to this agreement, everything quickly stabilized and China returned to business as usual. Everyone was happy! This is the good news!!! The bad news, perhaps unsurprising to some, is that China has COMPLETELY VIOLATED THEIR AGREEMENT WITH US. That's the price of being Mr. Nice Guy.” Following the news, Bitcoin (BTC) fell to $ 105,100. Along with Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH) and altcoins also fell. Following the news, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told CNBC that they are focused on monitoring China's compliance, or in this case non-compliance, with the agreement. Greer also said China's behavior was “completely unacceptable” and that the U.S. was “very concerned” about China's non-compliance on trade. Greer said that there are daily talks with the Indian Trade Minister on trade agreements, and added that he will hold talks with Malaysia, Vietnam and the EU at the OECD next week. “China is moving slowly to lift some retaliatory tariffs. Tariffs can expand if necessary,” Greer said. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: JUST IN! New Development in US-China Tariff Agreement: Trump Made a Statement!

2025-05-30T12:10:54.000Z,"Bitcoin ETFs See First Joint Outflow in Weeks as Market Dips","U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a net outflow of $347 million on May 29, marking the first collective day of redemptions in over two weeks. According to data from CoinGlass, this broke a 10-day inflow streak across all 11 ETFs , with the last similar pullback occurring on May 13. This outflow also marks the largest single-day capital flight since March 11, when investors pulled $396 million from the funds. The sharp outflow followed a drop in Bitcoin’s price, which fell over 3.5% during the day. The world’s largest cryptocurrency slid from an intraday high of $108,850 to briefly dip below the $105,000 mark. The pullback in price appears to have triggered significant selling activity, especially among institutional ETF holders. Fidelity and Grayscale Lead the Exodus The Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) bore the brunt of the outflows, losing $166 million in a single day. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) followed with a $107.5 million outflow. Other notable exits included funds managed by Bitwise, Ark 21Shares, Invesco, Franklin Templeton, and VanEck. Meanwhile, CoinShares, WisdomTree, and Grayscale’s mini Bitcoin trust reported no flows for the day. Despite the general downtrend, BlackRock’s IBIT continued to attract capital , recording $125 million in net inflows. The fund has now notched up 34 consecutive days of inflows, having last seen a redemption on April 9. Over the past two weeks alone, IBIT has brought in nearly $4 billion, pushing its total net inflows to $49 billion and assets under management beyond the $70 billion mark. Ethereum ETFs Attract Capital Amid Bitcoin Outflows Interestingly, spot Ethereum ETFs defied the bearish trend affecting Bitcoin products. On the same day, they collectively logged $92 million in net inflows, extending their own 10-day inflow streak. The last day of outflows for these funds was May 15. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) was once again the front-runner, bringing in just over $50 million in new capital. The fund has now accumulated $4.5 billion in inflows since its launch in July 2024. Commenting on the broader outlook, ETF Store President Nate Geraci highlighted a significant capital rotation, noting that while more than $9 billion has flowed into spot Bitcoin ETFs in the past five weeks, gold ETFs have lost nearly $3 billion in the same timeframe. He also pointed to recent SEC clarity on staking, calling it a major step forward for Ethereum ETF products.

2025-05-30T12:10:07.000Z,"Sudden Reversal: US Spot Bitcoin ETFs See $347 Million Outflows","BitcoinWorld Sudden Reversal: US Spot Bitcoin ETFs See $347 Million Outflows Just when it seemed like the positive momentum was unstoppable, the trend for US spot Bitcoin ETFs took a sharp turn. After enjoying an impressive run of 11 consecutive trading days with net inflows, these popular investment vehicles experienced a significant shift on May 29th, recording substantial Bitcoin ETF outflows . This sudden reversal has naturally sparked discussions across the crypto market , prompting investors and analysts alike to assess the potential implications for the Bitcoin price and the broader landscape of institutional investment in digital assets. What Happened with US Spot Bitcoin ETFs on May 29? According to data shared by market observer Trader T (@thepfund) on X, May 29th saw a combined net outflow of $347 million from US spot Bitcoin ETFs . This figure represents a clear break from the recent streak of positive inflows that had characterized the market for nearly two weeks. The outflows were spread across several prominent funds, indicating a broad, albeit uneven, movement of capital out of these products. Here’s a breakdown of the funds that saw net outflows: Fidelity’s FBTC: $166.32 million Grayscale’s GBTC: $107.53 million ARK Invest’s ARKB: $89.22 million Bitwise’s BITB: $70.85 million Invesco’s BTCO: $20.05 million VanEck’s HODL: $11.98 million Franklin Templeton’s EZBC: $6.13 million Cumulatively, these seven ETFs accounted for the vast majority of the day’s net negative flow. Who Bucked the Trend Amidst the Bitcoin ETF Outflows? In contrast to the widespread outflows, only one of the actively trading US spot Bitcoin ETFs managed to attract net inflows on May 29th. BlackRock’s IBIT, often a strong performer in terms of inflows, recorded a net positive flow of $125.22 million for the day. This highlights that while there was a general movement towards exiting positions, some funds continued to see buying interest. Other ETFs in the market reported no changes in their holdings, meaning they experienced neither significant inflows nor outflows on that particular day. Understanding the Impact on Bitcoin Price and the Crypto Market Net flows into or out of US spot Bitcoin ETFs are closely watched metrics by investors and analysts. These flows are often seen as a proxy for the level of institutional investment and broader investor sentiment towards Bitcoin. Significant outflows can sometimes exert downward pressure on the Bitcoin price , as ETF issuers may need to sell underlying Bitcoin to meet redemptions. While a single day of outflows, even a substantial one like $347 million, doesn’t necessarily signal a long-term reversal, it does serve as a reminder of the volatility inherent in the crypto market . The recent 11-day inflow streak had contributed to positive sentiment and potentially supported Bitcoin’s price rally towards the $70,000 mark. A sudden outflow event can temper that enthusiasm and lead to price consolidation or a minor pullback. Potential reasons for the outflows could include: Profit-Taking: After a period of positive price action, some investors might be taking profits on their ETF holdings. Market Rotation: Capital might be rotating into other assets or sectors, either within crypto or traditional finance. Macroeconomic Factors: Shifts in global economic outlook, interest rate expectations, or other macro news could influence investor risk appetite. Specific Fund Dynamics: Outflows from a fund like GBTC can sometimes be related to its specific structure or investor base dynamics. The event underscores the interconnectedness between traditional financial products like ETFs and the underlying digital asset market. Monitoring these flows provides valuable insight into the ebb and flow of institutional investment . Why Did Institutional Investment See a Pullback? The primary investors in US spot Bitcoin ETFs are often considered to be institutional players and sophisticated retail investors seeking regulated exposure to Bitcoin. The sudden shift from consistent inflows to significant outflows suggests a collective decision by a portion of this investor base to reduce their exposure. While the exact motivations are multifaceted and difficult to pinpoint definitively for every investor, the overall trend indicates a temporary pause or reversal in the recent bullish sentiment among some institutional participants. It’s crucial to remember that institutional investment isn’t monolithic; different firms and individuals have varying strategies, time horizons, and risk tolerances. Understanding the drivers behind these shifts is key to navigating the crypto market . While ETFs offer a regulated pathway for institutional investment , they also tie the performance and flows of Bitcoin more closely to traditional financial market dynamics and sentiment. Key Takeaways from the Outflow Event This recent development offers several important insights for anyone interested in US spot Bitcoin ETFs and the broader crypto market : Volatility Remains: Even with increasing institutional adoption, the market for Bitcoin and related products remains volatile and subject to rapid sentiment shifts. Flows are Crucial: ETF flow data provides a real-time pulse on institutional interest and can influence short-term price action. Not a Unanimous Trend: While many funds saw outflows, BlackRock’s IBIT continued to attract inflows, showing varied strategies among investors. Context is King: A single day’s data point should be viewed in the context of longer-term trends and broader market conditions. For investors, monitoring these flows alongside other fundamental and technical indicators is essential for making informed decisions regarding their exposure to Bitcoin and the crypto market . Conclusion: Navigating the Dynamic World of Bitcoin ETFs The $347 million in net outflows from US spot Bitcoin ETFs on May 29th marked a notable pause in the recent positive momentum. This event, ending an 11-day streak of inflows, highlights the dynamic nature of the market and the factors influencing institutional investment . While several funds experienced significant Bitcoin ETF outflows , BlackRock’s IBIT managed to attract inflows, showcasing varied investor behavior. This shift serves as a reminder that the path for the Bitcoin price and the overall crypto market is rarely a straight line, and staying informed about these key indicators is vital for navigating the landscape effectively.

2025-05-30T12:07:20.000Z,"BTC to $120K? Analysts say MUTM hits $5 as capital rotates into DeFi","With Bitcoin (BTC) setting sights on the $120,000 mark in this bullish cycle, crypto analysts are looking beyond the blue-chip rally to the next wave of opportunity. The current sentiment mirrors the 2020–2021 bull run, when Bitcoin (BTC)’s price surge acted as the trigger for a massive influx of capital into decentralized finance. Just as BTC reached new highs back then, DeFi tokens followed with exponential gains. This time, a new generation of DeFi projects is poised to benefit, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is at the front of the pack. Analysts have started naming Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the next breakout token with a direct path to $5, citing its strong fundamentals, real product, and early pricing advantage. The project is designed to thrive as capital rotates from major assets like Bitcoin (BTC) into smaller, high-upside DeFi protocols. Why capital moves from BTC to DeFi Historically, Bitcoin (BTC) leads every crypto bull run. As it breaks into new all-time highs, early investors begin to rotate their profits into altcoins with lower market caps and higher growth potential. In the 2020 cycle, various projects saw explosive gains as users shifted focus to earning passive income and participating in decentralized finance. Once Bitcoin (BTC) momentum stabilizes, attention turns to utility-driven projects with scalable income models. This is where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioned perfectly. Its protocol offers real returns through decentralized lending, appealing to both yield-seeking investors and early adopters of high-performing tokens. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is built for the next DeFi wave Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized, non-custodial lending and borrowing platform where users can earn passive income or borrow against their assets. The system uses smart contracts to allow secure lending in both peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-contract (P2C) formats. It supports a broad range of digital assets including Ethereum (ETH), stablecoins like DAI, and even memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE)—tokens that traditional platforms ignore. The protocol’s smart lending design adjusts interest rates based on real-time market demand, which ensures consistent earnings for liquidity providers. When users deposit assets like DAI into the protocol, they receive mtTokens, which grow in value as interest accrues. In active pools, this passive income can reach double-digit annual returns depending on utilization levels. This practical income model is a major reason analysts are forecasting a steep climb in value for MUTM as the market turns its attention back to DeFi. At its current price of $0.03, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in its Phase 5 presale, with over $9.45 million raised and 11,650+ holders already onboard. Early adopters from Phase 1 saw entries near $0.01, meaning they’ve already tripled their investment. As the next price phases unlock, later participants will face reduced upside. Buying now at $0.03 offers a rare position. An investment of $2,000 secures 66,666 MUTM tokens. Once the token reaches $5, the value of that investment becomes $333,330. Those who wait risk entering at a higher price and earning a fraction of the return. The most significant gains always go to the earliest participants. As one analyst put it, “The people celebrating at $5 are the ones who had the conviction at $0.03.” Security, real product, and passive income: the winning trio Unlike many low-cap tokens, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t vaporware. It’s a real protocol backed by an audit from CertiK, which scored the token with a 70.00 in its security review. The audit included both static code analysis and manual inspection, and helps build trust for users providing capital to the pools. More importantly, the project is not just preparing for a future product—it is actively building. The team plans to release the beta version of the platform by the time MUTM is live on exchanges. This timing aligns perfectly with the expected rotation of capital from BTC profits into working DeFi products. Passive income is no longer a luxury in the crypto world; it’s a strategy. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enables users to lend DAI or ETH and earn yield without giving up custody of their funds. This kind of product-market fit matters in a maturing ecosystem where security, usability, and earnings define long-term winners. As BTC climbs toward $120,000, large and mid-sized crypto investors will begin looking for undervalued, functional projects with high upside. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already on their radar. With a current market cap that remains a fraction of even the smaller DeFi platforms, MUTM offers the asymmetric upside that smart traders chase after every Bitcoin (BTC) peak. The early numbers already prove the interest is growing. With nearly $9.5 million raised and a community expanding daily, momentum is clearly building ahead of the token’s exchange debut. Add in the ongoing $100,000 giveaway campaign, and it’s clear that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is doing more than just building tech—it’s building community, liquidity, and attention. Final word Smart money always rotates from secure blue-chip assets like Bitcoin (BTC) into the next opportunity. In 2020, it was DeFi. In 2025, it’s DeFi again—but better. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just following that path; it’s paving a better one. Those who catch this wave early are the ones who win big. Waiting until MUTM is trading at $0.20 or $0.50 means the profit curve has already begun to flatten. The $0.03 price tag won’t last long, and the $5 target is no longer just a dream—it’s a logical destination.

2025-05-30T12:01:27.000Z,"Best Meme Coins to Buy During the Market Crash: Is This a Correction or Worse?","The crypto market is once again living up to its volatile reputation. With Bitcoin recently tumbling from its lofty $106K perch and a sea of red washing over most altcoins in the last 24 hours, ‘crypto crashing’ is a trending search term, and for good reason. Investors are understandably on edge, asking the crucial question: Is this a temporary blip, a correction after a strong run, or are we staring down the barrel of a more significant downturn? Navigating the turbulent waters can be daunting. However, periods of market fear can also present unique, albeit high-risk, opportunities. For the daring investor, the meme coin sector, known for its explosive potential (and equally dramatic nosedives), might be of interest. Some traders will be eyeing specific meme coins, wondering if the current dip offers a discounted entry point. If this dip is just a market correction, the real question becomes: which meme coins are built to survive the storm and thrive when the skies clear? From seasoned tokens with staying power to buzzy newcomers making serious noise, the hunt is on for meme coins that can hold their ground and deliver when the rebound hits. And don’t sleep on the best presales either. Projects like Snorter Token ($SNORT) and BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) are revving up for launch with real momentum, and could reward early believers with serious upside. In a market like this, timing is everything, and catching the next breakout project before the crowd does could make all the difference. 1. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Sniff, Snipe, Succeed. Master Meme Coin Trading In Telegram. If you’re tired of missing out on the next big meme coin, Snorter Token ($SNORT) is your new secret weapon. Helping you navigate crypto-trading from the convenience of your Telegram app, $SNORT will help you sniff out those early, under-the-radar gems before they hit the mainstream. The integrated Snorter Bot is about to become your Swiss Army knife, giving you all the tools you need to identify promising coins with speed and precision. $SNORT powers a trading experience built for rapid execution, leveraging the low fees and high speeds of chains like Solana. Holding $SNORT tokens can further enhance your edge, offering potential benefits like reduced trading fees within the bot. You can buy $SNORT now for $0.0935, and it’s raised an impressive $246K already. If you stake during the presale, you can expect rewards of up to 1215%. By combining intelligent discovery tools with a powerful trading bot and token holder benefits, $SNORT has the chops to level the playing field and potentially come in strong despite the recent market red. 2. Cat in a Dog’s World ($MEW) – Solana’s Feline Fury, Challenging the Meme Coin Pack. Some investors see red as a challenge to find the coins that fight back. Enter Cat In a Dog’s World ($MEW) , the feisty alternative to the crowded dog-themed crypto market. Built on the high-speed, low-fee Solana blockchain, $MEW isn’t just another cute face in the meme coin crowd. It embodies a rebellious spirit, playfully ready to claw its way into the territory dominated by the likes of Dogecoin. This feline fury is all about carving a unique niche, backed by a rapidly growing community captivated by its disruption and the technical advantages of its Solana foundation. You can buy $MEW for $0.003362 on Kraken . Coins like $MEW, with distinct branding and passionate followings ( 137K+ followers on X , and 25K+ subscribers on Telegram ), offer resilience, and its clear underdog (or rather undercat) appeal, could make it an intriguing addition for those looking for high-potential plays during market uncertainty. 3. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Bitcoin Rewards & Token Burns. Multiply Your Bull Run. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is an innovative way to align with $BTC’s potential long-term success. This isn’t just another meme coin. It directly rewards its holders with actual $BTC as the flagship crypto achieves key price milestones. Hold your $BTCBULL in Best Wallet (one of the leading non-custodial crypto wallets) to receive your rewards. Furthermore, $BTCBULL incorporates a strategic token burn mechanism, reducing its supply as $BTC climbs, thereby enhancing scarcity and value for its community. While the current market might be red, savvy investors understand that volatility is part and parcel of crypto. Many adopt longer-term perspectives, focusing on foundational assets. $BTC in particular continues to see positive signals in the evolving regulatory discussion, cementing itself as a cornerstone of the digital asset space that isn’t going anywhere. You can snap up $BTCBULL for $0.00254 with 63% staking rewards. We see $BTCBULL going the distance and predict it will reach $0.06467 by the end of 2025, a 2446.06% increase on today’s presale price. For those who believe in $BTC’s enduring trajectory, $BTCBULL offers a unique proposition: a chance to not only ride the wave of the eventual bull run but potentially multiply those gains through its distinct rewards. 4. Just a Chill Guy ($CHILL) – No Hype, No Stress. Just Good Vibes on The Blockchain. Okay, yes, the market is generally red at the moment, but take a leaf from the playbook of Just a Chill Guy ($CHILL) and relax. $CHILL isn’t about chasing fleeting pumps or navigating complexity; it’s cultivated around the simple ethos of providing a relaxed, community-centric space in the often frenetic meme coin universe. The core idea is to build a token where the community can keep calm, fostering a sense of stability and shared patience. The market red can be taxing, but this is where a project like $CHILL might find its unique appeal. It’s a coin that offers a different kind of value, one centred around a low-pressure vibe. If you’re looking for a project less frantic about speculation and more about shared long-term beliefs in a simple concept and its collective, the $CHILL philosophy could be your proposition. $CHILL is available for $0.07465 on decentralized exchanges. In times of uncertainty, the strength of a calm, committed community can be a strong signal, suggesting that sometimes the most chill approach is the one that endures. Red Sea Opportunities: Investing Wisely When Markets Dip A market downturn can reveal unique opportunities for investors. While creating uncertainty, projects in the meme coin sector, like the utility-focused $SNORT or the $BTC rewarding $BTCBULL , aim to offer distinct propositions, even in challenging times. At any time, but even more so in the red, always do your own research and invest only what you can afford to lose.",newsbtc,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/best-meme-coins-to-buy-during-the-market-crash/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING","Cryptocurrency Market News|Meme coins",cryptocompare
2025-05-30T12:00:02.000Z,"Alchemy Pay Powers Seamless On-Ramp for WLFI’s USD1 Stablecoin","BitcoinWorld Alchemy Pay Powers Seamless On-Ramp for WLFI’s USD1 Stablecoin Getting into the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) and stablecoins can sometimes feel like navigating a complex maze. However, a recent collaboration aims to simplify this process significantly for users interested in the USD1 stablecoin . Crypto payment gateway Alchemy Pay (ACH) has officially announced a strategic partnership with World Liberty Financial ( WLFI ), a DeFi project that has garnered attention due to its links to the Trump family. This collaboration marks a significant step towards providing seamless crypto on-ramp access for WLFI ‘s USD1 stablecoin , directly addressing one of the major hurdles for mainstream crypto adoption: converting fiat currency into digital assets easily and efficiently. What Does This Alchemy Pay and WLFI Partnership Entail? The core of this partnership revolves around integrating Alchemy Pay ‘s robust payment gateway services with the WLFI ecosystem. Announced via Alchemy Pay ‘s official Medium blog, the collaboration means that users no longer need to navigate potentially complex cryptocurrency exchanges or peer-to-peer platforms to acquire USD1 stablecoin . Instead, they can leverage Alchemy Pay ‘s extensive network of supported payment methods to directly purchase USD1 using their preferred fiat currency. For those new to the space, a ‘ crypto on-ramp ‘ is essentially a service that allows individuals to convert their traditional fiat money (like USD, EUR, GBP, etc.) into cryptocurrency. Think of it as the bridge between the traditional financial system and the crypto world. Making this bridge as smooth and accessible as possible is crucial for increasing user adoption and liquidity within specific crypto ecosystems like WLFI ‘s. By integrating Alchemy Pay ‘s capabilities, WLFI is significantly lowering the barrier to entry for potential users of its USD1 stablecoin and associated DeFi services. This is particularly important for a project seeking wider reach and participation. Why is Seamless Crypto On-Ramp Access Important for USD1 Stablecoin ? Stablecoins like USD1 stablecoin are designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. They serve multiple purposes within the crypto landscape, including: Store of Value: Offering stability compared to volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Medium of Exchange: Facilitating quick and low-cost transfers globally. DeFi Participation: Acting as essential building blocks for lending, borrowing, and yield farming protocols within decentralized finance platforms. However, accessing stablecoins often requires users to first buy a major cryptocurrency (like BTC or ETH) on an exchange and then trade it for the stablecoin. This multi-step process can be intimidating and cumbersome for newcomers. A direct crypto on-ramp solution, powered by a reputable payment gateway like Alchemy Pay , streamlines this process into potentially just a few clicks, making it far more user-friendly. For WLFI ‘s USD1 stablecoin , enhanced accessibility via a direct on-ramp means: Increased liquidity for USD1 . Easier participation in any DeFi protocols or services offered by WLFI that utilize USD1 . A broader potential user base, including those less familiar with traditional crypto exchanges. How Does Alchemy Pay ‘s Payment Gateway Facilitate This? Alchemy Pay operates a comprehensive payment gateway that connects fiat and crypto economies. Its infrastructure supports a wide array of global and local payment methods, making it a versatile tool for businesses and projects looking to integrate crypto payments or on/off-ramps. Key features of Alchemy Pay ‘s payment gateway that benefit the WLFI partnership include: Extensive Payment Method Support: Acceptance of major credit and debit cards (Visa, Mastercard), various bank transfer options, and numerous local payment channels specific to different regions. Global Coverage: Ability to process transactions from users in many countries, expanding the potential reach for WLFI ‘s USD1 stablecoin . Compliance and Security: Handling necessary regulatory compliance and security measures for processing fiat-to-crypto transactions. Ease of Integration: Providing tools and APIs that allow partners like WLFI to seamlessly embed the on-ramp service directly into their platforms or websites. This technical capability is what underpins the ‘seamless access’ touted in the announcement. Users interacting with WLFI ‘s platform (or wherever the integration is live) can now initiate a purchase of USD1 stablecoin and complete the transaction using familiar fiat payment methods, all powered by Alchemy Pay ‘s backend. Exploring the WLFI Project and USD1 Stablecoin World Liberty Financial ( WLFI ) is positioned as a DeFi project. While the original announcement highlights its link to the Trump family, the core focus from a technical perspective is its offering, specifically the USD1 stablecoin . Understanding WLFI ‘s broader goals and the intended use cases for USD1 stablecoin provides context for why a seamless crypto on-ramp is a critical piece of infrastructure for them. Typically, DeFi projects aim to recreate traditional financial services (like lending, borrowing, trading) using blockchain technology, often utilizing stablecoins as the primary medium of value exchange due to their price stability. For WLFI , the USD1 stablecoin likely serves as the native stable asset within its specific DeFi ecosystem or planned applications. Making it easy for users to acquire USD1 directly with fiat is essential for driving activity and participation within that ecosystem. The partnership with Alchemy Pay suggests WLFI is prioritizing user accessibility and aiming to onboard users who may be new to DeFi or crypto but are interested in the specific offerings or community around WLFI . Benefits of the Partnership: A Closer Look Let’s break down the tangible benefits this collaboration brings: For WLFI : Access to Alchemy Pay ‘s global payment gateway network instantly expands the potential user base for USD1 stablecoin . It removes technical hurdles for onboarding new users who hold fiat, increasing liquidity and potentially driving adoption of other WLFI services. It positions WLFI as a more accessible DeFi project. For USD1 Stablecoin Users: The primary benefit is convenience. Users can now purchase USD1 stablecoin directly using their local fiat payment methods without needing to use separate exchanges or complex crypto wallets initially. This simplifies the process significantly, saving time and potentially reducing fees associated with multiple transactions. For the Broader Crypto Ecosystem: Partnerships like this contribute to the overall goal of making cryptocurrency and DeFi more accessible to a mainstream audience. By providing user-friendly on-ramps for specific assets like USD1 stablecoin , they help bridge the gap between traditional finance and the decentralized world. Actionable Insight: How to Use the New On-Ramp While specific steps may vary slightly depending on where WLFI integrates the service, the general process for users wishing to purchase USD1 stablecoin via the Alchemy Pay payment gateway would typically involve: Visiting the official WLFI platform or a service that has integrated the Alchemy Pay on-ramp. Locating the option to ‘Buy USD1 ‘ or ‘Add Funds’. Selecting Alchemy Pay as the payment provider. Choosing their preferred fiat currency and the amount of USD1 they wish to purchase. Selecting a supported payment method (e.g., Visa, Mastercard, bank transfer). Completing the required payment and verification steps through Alchemy Pay ‘s secure interface. Receiving the purchased USD1 stablecoin directly into their connected crypto wallet. This streamlined flow is designed to mimic familiar online purchase experiences, reducing friction for users entering the crypto space. The Road Ahead for Alchemy Pay and WLFI This partnership is a clear indication of both Alchemy Pay ‘s continued strategy to expand its payment gateway services across various crypto projects and WLFI ‘s effort to enhance the accessibility of its USD1 stablecoin . As the DeFi space evolves, seamless on-ramps will remain a critical component for attracting and retaining users. The success of this integration will likely be measured by the ease of use reported by users and the increase in accessibility and liquidity for the USD1 stablecoin within the WLFI ecosystem. Partnerships like this highlight the ongoing effort within the crypto industry to build user-friendly infrastructure that connects the traditional financial world with the innovative possibilities of blockchain and DeFi. Conclusion: Bridging Fiat and USD1 Stablecoin with Ease The strategic partnership between Alchemy Pay and WLFI is a significant development for anyone interested in accessing the USD1 stablecoin . By integrating Alchemy Pay ‘s versatile payment gateway , WLFI has effectively created a seamless crypto on-ramp , allowing users to purchase USD1 stablecoin directly using a wide range of fiat payment methods. This move not only enhances the accessibility of USD1 but also contributes to lowering the barrier to entry for the WLFI DeFi ecosystem. As the crypto landscape matures, collaborations focused on improving the user experience, particularly at the fiat-to-crypto conversion point, are essential for driving wider adoption. This partnership is a prime example of such an effort, promising a more convenient path for users to acquire USD1 stablecoin and engage with the WLFI project.

Economists expect a soft PCE print, potentially boosting Bitcoin and other risk assets. A high PCE reading (0.3%+ monthly core) could trigger crypto price drops and volatility. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis is scheduled to release its key inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, tonight, putting the crypto market on watch for potential turbulence, which is a critical indicator for the Federal Reserve. With Bitcoin hovering around $106,000 and altcoins in a state of flux, traders are eyeing the PCE data for cues that could tip the scales toward long-awaited interest rate cuts. What Economists Are Expecting from Core PCE Economists expect the core PCE to rise just 0.1% in April, a soft print that would extend a three-month cooling streak in inflation. On a yearly basis, the headline PCE is projected to drop to 2.2%, its lowest in seven months, while the core reading is forecast to ease to 2.5%, the softest since March 2021.

2025-05-30T11:59:22.000Z,"James Wynn Goes Long on PEPE Hours After Losing $100M on Leveraged Bitcoin Bet","“James Wynn,” the closely-watched trader, has now placed a $12 million worth of long bet on PEPE just hours after losing over $100 million in bitcoin BTC long positions. Wynn, known for placing billion-dollar bets on the onchain trading platform Hyperliquid, opened a new 10x leveraged long worth more than $12 million on the memecoin PEPE, Hyperdash data shows. Wynn now holds 934 million PEPE tokens valued at approximately $12.1 million. His entry price of $0.0129 has already netted him an unrealized gain of 10.66%—a small but notable pivot after last week’s disastrous Bitcoin trade. Wynn’s bitcoin losses are the stuff of crypto legend. Earlier in the week, he had built a record-setting $1.25 billion notional long position at an average price of $108,243, only to see it collapse as bitcoin’s dipped below $105,000 after U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff announcement on EU exports. Multiple liquidations — including a 527 BTC position worth over $55 million and a 421 BTC position worth nearly $44 million — wiped out more than $100 million of Wynn’s holdings over the past days. As such, the latest move into PEPE has got traders wondering if Wynn is a real person with a gambling addiction — or an account funded to drum up attention to Hyperliquid. Either way, the money is real and the week-long saga has proven Hyperliquid’s capability to handle billions of dollars in a single trader wholly using smart contracts and its native blockchain. The hype has turned out real for Hyperliquid’s own HYPE, with the token up 20% in the past two weeks amid the recent attention to the platform.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/30/james-wynn-goes-long-on-pepe-hours-after-losing-100m-on-leveraged-bitcoin-bet,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|PEPE","Markets|Pepe|Bitcoin|Leveraged Trading|News",cryptocompare
