According to CoinMarketCap data on May 30, the overall crypto market cap dropped from $3.45 trillion to $3.32 trillion, a 3.77% decline. Crypto market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap Bitcoin , the market’s bellwether, is now trading just above $105,000, down 3% on the day. Altcoins have been hit even harder. XRP has slipped 4% erasing $6 billion , Solana is down roughly 5%, and Dogecoin has led the declines in the top 10 digital assets by market worth with a 9% drop. Cryptocurrency market pullback amid uncertainty Short-term momentum has clearly shifted, and several major assets are now testing key support levels. Risk-off sentiment appears to have gripped traders amid macro uncertainty and renewed concerns over near-term crypto inflows. However, this sell-off hasn’t erased the strong gains seen over the past quarter, Bitcoin remains firmly above its 200-day moving average and is still up significantly year-to-date. While the broader trend for Bitcoin and select large-caps remains upward on higher time frames, today’s drop underscores how quickly sentiment can shift in the current market. With June around the corner and several token unlocks and macro events on the radar, short-term caution may continue to dominate.

Jamie Raskin Demands Guest List of $TRUMP Coin Dinner appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A heated controversy is brewing in Washington as Rep. Jamie Raskin pushes President Donald Trump to reveal the full list of guests who attended a private dinner after purchasing $TRUMP memecoins. These attendees reportedly spent close to $400 million just to get access. This demand comes during the Bitcoin 2025 Conference in Las Vegas , where major crypto figures like Vice President JD Vance, Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, the Winklevoss twins, and pardoned Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht are promoting the administration’s strong pro-crypto stance. Jamie Raskin Calls for Transparency: Who Bought Their Way In? In a letter sent Thursday, Raskin pressed President Trump to disclose the names of all 220 buyers who used $TRUMP coins to secure a spot at the private dinner. He pointed out that many of these buyers appear to be foreign nationals who only purchased the coins after the event was announced. “These 220 buyers…collectively spent hundreds of millions of dollars — $394 million by one account,” said Raskin, noting that “we deserve to know who is paying for access to our president.” He also expressed serious concerns that the event may break laws regarding foreign government payments, known as emoluments laws. Raskin demanded full disclosure of the sources of funds each attendee used to purchase the coins and set a deadline of June 4, 2025, for this information. The Focus on Justin Sun and Potential Foreign Influence One high-profile figure in the spotlight is Chinese-born crypto investor Justin Sun. He reportedly spent $23 million on $TRUMP coins. Sun has previously faced investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for his connections to a Trump-related crypto firm. Raskin warned that some of the funds may come from illegal sources or foreign governments, raising red flags about possible foreign influence through cryptocurrency. He was clear about what the public should know: beyond “virtually worthless memecoins,” what exactly are these buyers getting in return for their millions? Crypto, Politics, and a Growing Scrutiny This controversy unfolds at a critical moment for cryptocurrency in the U.S. The Trump administration’s aggressive push to embrace crypto, showcased at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference, marks a significant shift in policy. However, Raskin’s demands highlight the ongoing concerns about foreign money mixing with political power through digital assets. With the June 4 deadline fast approaching, all eyes are on President Trump to see if he will disclose the details about who is buying access – and with what money.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/whos-buying-access-to-trump-jamie-raskin-demands-guest-list-of-trump-coin-dinner/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION","News",cryptocompare
2025-05-30T09:44:12.000Z,"Panama city eyes Bitcoin fees for canal ships","Panama City Mayor Mayer Mizrachi has proposed granting priority access to ships that pay transit fees using Bitcoin. This initiative aims to integrate cryptocurrency into the canal’s operations, potentially offering a more efficient payment method for expedited passage. Mizrachi shared this idea on May 29 while speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas alongside other Bitcoin supporters from El Salvador. Panama City Mayor proposes Bitcoin payments for priority canal transit Mizrachi spoke on the panel alongside Bitcoin advocates, El Salvador government advisors Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert, and moderator Mike Peterson from Bitcoin Beach. He suggested that cargo ships waiting to pass through the Panama Canal can pay their transit fees in Bitcoin and get priority access. The mayor pointed out that this idea could position Panama as a leading digital finance and technology center and bring Bitcoin deeper into the country’s economy. The Panama Canal saves cargo ships weeks of travel time that they would have to spend if they sailed around the southern tip of South America because it links the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. The canal handles about 5% of all global maritime commerce, and nearly 10,000 ships passed through it between October 2023 and September 2024, carrying more than 423 million tons of cargo and generating almost $5 billion in revenue for Panama. Mizrachi’s idea comes at a time of political tension since President Donald Trump publicly demanded that the United States take back control of the Panama Canal in December 2024. Trump criticized the toll system by claiming that U.S. ships pay higher fees than ships from other countries and argued that China’s growing influence over the canal threatens American interests. The mayor’s idea to accept Bitcoin payments for faster canal transit in this complicated situation supports Panama’s digital growth goals. It makes the canal more competitive and efficient on the international trade stage. Panama City embraces Bitcoin for tax payments and proposes City-level crypto reserve Panama City approved a new rule that allows people and businesses to pay their municipal taxes, fines, and fees using Bitcoin and other digital currencies. This move shows that the city trusts digital currency and wants to give people more flexible ways to meet their financial obligations to the government. Mayor Mizrachi also proposed to create a dedicated Bitcoin reserve for Panama City to help stabilize its finances and attract new investment opportunities since the city contributes more than half of the country’s gross domestic product. He also said he could set up the reserve at the city level without waiting for the national legislature to pass any new laws. The mayor used strong language to warn lawmakers to avoid rushing into new rules that could slow progress or scare away innovation. He said, “Don’t touch it, don’t get near it, don’t even look at it,” emphasizing that the government should give Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies the space to grow naturally. Mizrachi told lawmakers to watch how people use Bitcoin over time and only bring rules that protect users or improve systems. Mizrachi said the country transacts over $5 billion in Bitcoin annually, but most of it remains hidden because many fear the legal or social risks of being open about their involvement with crypto. The mayor believes that making the system more open, transparent, and officially supported will encourage more people and businesses to come forward. The decision to adopt Bitcoin also comes amidst social and economic tension. Panama declared a state of emergency in the Bocas del Toro province following news that a well-known banana company, Chiquita, was laying off over 5,000 workers. Those employees were demonstrating for additional social security guarantees and improved working conditions. In other discussion forums, Mizrach sai d cr yptocurrencies can function as safety nets when traditional infrastructures do not help the country’s most vulnerable people.

Sužinokite daugiau apie Solaxy Šiame straipsnyje apžvelgsime, ką prognozuoja ChatGPT, kokios priežastys lemia Dogecoin atsigavimą bei kodėl Solaxy gali tapti vienu įdomiausių altkoinų 2025 metais. Dogecoin (DOGE) kainos prognozė: artėja naujos aukštumos? Meme kriptovaliuta Dogecoin (DOGE) per pastarąjį mėnesį išaugo net 26,74 %, o rinkos kapitalizacija jau siekia 4,5 mlrd. JAV dolerių.

Visgi, pasak Binance, DOGE kaina per artimiausius penkis metus pakils nuo $0,2046 šiandien iki $0,278206 – ne toks drastiškas, bet vis tiek pozityvus augimas. Šį optimizmą grindžia keli veiksniai: Aktyvi bendruomenė, kuri jau daugelį metų palaiko šį projektą; Augantis priėmimas kaip mokėjimo priemonė versle; Stiprus socialinių tinklų palaikymas.

2025-05-30T09:31:07.000Z,"India’s Crypto Regulation Policy Coming in June: What We Know So Far","The post India’s Crypto Regulation Policy Coming in June: What We Know So Far appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News India might finally be ready to make a real move on crypto and the global industry is watching. After years of uncertainty, the government is preparing to release a discussion paper on crypto regulation in June. For a country that’s gone from heavy taxes to long periods of silence, this could be a defining moment. With the global market heating up and Bitcoin recently touching a new all-time high above $111,900, India’s timing is interesting. What’s in the paper? Will it invite public opinion? Could this be the start of a more structured approach to crypto in India? Let’s unpack what we know so far. Supreme Court Steps In: Silence is No Longer an Option The pressure isn’t just coming from the markets. India’s Supreme Court has strongly called out the government’s delay in addressing crypto regulation. It warned that the ongoing legal vacuum is creating space for misuse and made it clear that banning crypto isn’t the solution. A bench led by Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh questioned why, while other global economies are moving ahead with their own regulatory frameworks, India is yet to make a clear decision. This paper appears to be a direct response. According to reports, the government’s upcoming proposal will draw heavily from the IMF and Financial Stability Board’s recent synthesis report. There are also signs that it might open the floor for public input, giving stakeholders a chance to contribute to the process. India’s Journey So Far: Tax First, Clarity Later India’s crypto story has had its share of growing pains. The 2023 budget introduced a 30% tax on crypto profits, which pushed many users and exchanges to rethink their presence in the country. While firms were required to register with the Financial Intelligence Unit, the sector still lacks formal recognition. The Reserve Bank of India has remained cautious, often highlighting risks like money laundering and terror financing. At the same time, it has continued to promote its central bank digital currency as a safer alternative to private crypto assets. According to a recent report by think tank Esya Centre , nearly 90% of Indian crypto trading has moved offshore, largely in response to existing policies. Industry voices have warned that the current setup limits innovation and drives users toward unregulated platforms. Global Momentum Is Building – Can India Keep Pace? While India works through its roadmap, global powers are setting the tone. In the US, President Donald Trump has shifted the country’s stance with a bold pro-crypto approach. His administration has pardoned several digital asset leaders, backed a strategic bitcoin reserve, and seen the Senate pass stablecoin-focused legislation. Meanwhile, the European Union is already rolling out its MiCA regulation, setting clear rules for digital asset firms operating across its member states. A Defining Moment for India One senior Indian official noted that the country would approach crypto decisions with the national interest in mind, and avoid “knee-jerk” reactions. That could be key, especially in a market known for sudden shifts and global ripple effects. The industry will be watching closely and this time, expecting action.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/indias-crypto-regulation-policy-coming-in-june-what-we-know-so-far/,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","News",cryptocompare
2025-05-30T09:30:27.000Z,"Bitcoin MVRV Ratio Signals Price Hot, But Not In Danger Zone Yet","On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio is getting high, but still outside this extreme territory. Bitcoin MVRV Ratio Yet To Surpass +1 SD Line In its latest weekly report, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how Bitcoin is currently looking from the perspective of the MVRV Ratio. The “MVRV Ratio” is a popular indicator that, in short, tells us about how the value held by the investors as a whole compares against their initial investment. Related Reading: Toncoin Open Interest Spikes 33%—Will History Repeat With A Pullback? When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means the holders are carrying more than they put in. In other words, they are in a state of net profit. On the other hand, the indicator being under the threshold suggests the overall network is underwater. The analytics firm has used the MVRV Ratio to define pricing bands that correspond to extreme deviations from the average investor profitability (that is, the mean value of the MVRV Ratio). These bands help point out periods where investor profits/losses are unusually high. Below is the chart shared by Glassnode in the report that shows the trend in these pricing bands for Bitcoin over the last few years. As displayed in the graph, the Bitcoin price has been trading above the mean level of this model since a while now. Recently, the asset has also broken above the +0.5 standard deviations (SD) line. This line corresponds to the price at which the MVRV Ratio attains a value that’s 0.5 standard deviations above the all-time mean. At present, the level is situated around $100,200. The level that BTC is yet to surpass in this latest rally is the +1 SD one, located at $119,400. From the chart, it’s visible that the cryptocurrency breaking above this line has generally led to a top for its price. The explanation behind this pattern lies in the fact that the larger investor profits grow, the more tempted holders become to take them. At extreme deviations of the MVRV Ratio, selling pressure from holders giving in to this temptation becomes significant, hence why the asset approaches a long-term top. In the current cycle, Bitcoin has breached the +1 SD level of the model on two occasions, ending up with the formations of the March 2024 and December 2024 peaks. For now, the current rally is still below this level, but above the +0.5 SD that also corresponds to a significant level of gains.

Analysts stated that price fluctuations may occur in BTC and ETH based on these rates. “Bitcoin has been mostly volatile this week, Ether has been relatively strong and the accumulation has been ongoing for two weeks. Data suggests that the market is still optimistic about BTC reaching new highs in the near future. ETH’s upward shock has started to slow down and the market has recalibrated ETH’s price and volatility. “Deliveries are less than 8% of total positions, a decline, and crypto institutions are not showing much reaction to new highs in Ethereum.

This liquidation was triggered by bitcoin’s dip below $105,000 early Friday. According to data from Arkham Intelligence, Wynn has been liquidated on four positions so far, totaling 1,134 BTC (over $118.8 million). He still has an open position with 40x leverage on the decentralized exchange (DEX) Hyperliquid, which is sitting on an unrealized loss of $4.7 million at the time of writing. $1B Bitcoin Bet Backfires CryptoPotato reported last week that Wynn built his 40x leverage long Bitcoin position from $390 million to $1.1 billion within seven days. Well-known as a high-risk leverage trader and meme coin maxi, the whale continued to increase his bets as bitcoin’s price kept rising. As BTC hit an all-time high (ATH) of $111,970 on May 22, the bet increased to $1.14 billion with an unrealized profit of over $39 million. By May 24, Wynn had pumped the bet to $1.25 billion, even as BTC had slipped from its ATH and was consolidating around $108,000 to $109,000. Although analysts’ predictions and on-chain data suggested that BTC had more room for growth in the short term, macroeconomic changes triggered a reversal in the asset’s trajectory. Buying and Holding is Better: Wynn While Wynn took profits from his big BTC bet, he believed the asset could hit the $115,000 to $118,000 target this week. Unfortunately, the opposite is true. Bitcoin is down 2.5% in the past 24 hours and was trading around $105,093 at writing time. Due to bitcoin’s decline over the last few hours, Wynn has been liquidated in four positions holding 91 BTC ($9.7 million), 527 BTC ($55.3 million), 421 BTC ($43.9 million), and 95 BTC ($10 million). Data from the Hyperliquid analytics platform, Hypurrscan, shows that the liquidations were triggered when BTC hit $106,330, $104,950, $104,150, and $104,620, respectively. Addressing his liquidation on X, Wynn tweeted that his bets have exposed the corruption in the crypto market. He insisted it is better to buy and hold BTC in cold storage rather than follow his investment strategy. One thing for sure is that I have exposed just how corrupt these markets are.

Payments-focused XRP dipped below the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) for the first time since April 10, indicating a strengthening of downward momentum. Prices fell below $2.20, registering 4.6% losses on a 24-hour basis, according to data source TradingView. The decline followed reports of increasing demand for XRP as a corporate Treasury asset. Prices for BTC, the premier digital asset by market value, briefly fell below $105,000 during European hours, extending overnight losses to trade nearly 3% lower on a 24-hour basis. BTC's losses followed a $358 million net outflow from the 11 spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) Thursday, their first since May 13 and highest single-day tally since March 11, according to data source SoSoValue . Renewed trade war fears also weighed over the sentiment. Other majors, such as ETH, SOL, and DOGE, posted larger losses, with smaller tokens like OP, ARB, BONK, and PEPE falling by over 10% each, according to data source Coingecko. Focus on U.S. core PCE Consumer prices, represented by the personal consumption expenditure index, rose 0.15% on a monthly basis in April, bringing the annual inflation rate down to 2.2% from 2.3% in March, according to economists surveyed by FactSet. The core PCE, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is forecast to have risen 0.12% on a monthly basis and 2.5% on an annual basis. Another good month for inflation could raise Fed rate cut bets, boding well for BTC and other assets. \""All eyes now turn to the Core PCE data due today, which could reignite bullish sentiment if inflation shows signs of easing,\"" Valentin Fournier, Lead Research Analyst at BRN, said in an email.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/30/xrp-falls-below-200-day-average-bitcoin-dips-to-usd105k-as-traders-eye-core-pce,"BTC|MARKET|XRP|ARB|BONK","Markets|XRP|Bitcoin|Markets|Markets|News",cryptocompare

2025-05-30T09:06:56.000Z,"Bitcoin (BTC) ready for Next Surge, But Major Hurdle ahead","All short-term momentum indicators up to the daily timeframe are now in an oversold condition. This would suggest that Bitcoin (BTC) is about to make its next upside move. Nevertheless, a major hurdle is on the horizon in the form of the weekly Stochastic RSI, posturing a swing back down in the indicators that can potentially bring some future heavy downside price momentum. Caution is required. Keeping it simple in trading In the field of technical analysis there are countless charts and indicators that can point a price in one direction or another, and often, at any particular point in time. Therefore, one strategy that tends to iron out the often perverse market fluctuations over time is that of keeping things very simple. There are a small number of indicators for Bitcoin, that if used over the longer time frames, will generally help to show the main trend that $BTC is following, and give pointers as to when we need to sit up and take notice that a trend break is about to occur. The Stochastic RSI is one of the most reliable indicators in this respect. It is used to measure momentum and identify overbought or oversold conditions. On the higher, weekly time frame, the Stochastic RSI is exhibiting an overbought condition - thus the cause for concern. Before looking at the bigger picture, the shorter time frames are currently looking bullish. They are suggesting that there could be a nice upside surge that could develop into the weekend. Correction from all-time high still taking place Source: TradingView In the 4-hour time frame it can be seen that the correction from last week’s all-time high is still taking place. The bears were able to force the price below the important $106,000 support, and $BTC is now at the $105,000 support level. There is the possibility that the price could drop through here, but it isn’t expected. If it does, the furthest dip to the downside would likely be to the $102,500 horizontal support. What is more likely is that the price will start to bounce from here, and could then gain momentum from all the short time frame Stochastic RSI indicators crossing up from the bottom. The targets would be to break back above $106,000, pierce up through the descending trendline, make a higher high, and then have the possibility of getting back to the all-time high. 3-day chart shows concerns are beginning Source: TradingView The 3-day chart shows that concerns are beginning. The ascending trendline is in the process of being broken, and should the current red candle still be on the wrong side of this trendline by the end of Friday, the breakdown will be confirmed. Having said that, the horizontal supports are very important, and a close above $106,000 would be seen as a victory for the bulls. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI on this time frame is looking ominous, with the indicator lines shaping to fall back down through the 80.00 level, and by doing so, bringing downside price momentum with them. Weekly Stochastic RSI signals a potential cross-down Source: TradingView As already mentioned, the weekly time frame is potentially the most problematic at this point in time. While it can be seen that the price is starting to roll over, it’s at the bottom of the chart where things are starting to become a little worrying. The Stochastic RSI has the blue indicator clearly angled down, and it is posturing to cross over the red indicator line. However, it’s not all doom and gloom quite yet. If the expected rally does take place into the last part of this week, the indicator lines could just end up flatlining along the top, much as they did in a 3-week period at the end of 2024. That said, they will have to come down at some point, putting an end to the upside price momentum. Is there still time in this bull market cycle for the indicator lines to drop all the way back to the bottom and then come back up for one last hurrah into Q4? Yes there is. Also, the indicator lines could bounce along the top for an extended period of time. The main take away here is that when the weekly Stochastic RSI indicators are at the top it signals caution to long-term traders, whereas when they are at the bottom, buys are signalled.

2025-05-30T09:01:29.000Z,"Court flip-flop on tariffs rattles investors","Markets woke up rattled on Friday as the chaos surrounding President Donald Trump’s tariff decisions continued to wear down investor confidence. According to data from CNBC, futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 31 points in early morning trading, while S&P 500 futures slipped 0.16%, and Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 0.21%. This came after a wave of uncertainty on Thursday when a federal court first blocked and then reinstated the majority of the president’s tariffs, triggering confusion across global trade desks. The legal drama unfolded late Wednesday night when the Court of International Trade decided to freeze most of the current tariffs imposed by the administration. But by Thursday afternoon, that same court reversed course, putting a temporary hold on its own order. Stocks recoil as legal chaos deepens This constant policy flip-flop is throwing both markets and global trade partners into a loop. The S&P 500, which was up nearly 0.9% during early Thursday trading, turned south fast after the Trump administration hinted at a possible appeal. The issue isn’t just whether the tariffs are good or bad, it’s that nobody knows when they’re real. That’s paralyzing for companies trying to plan shipments and for countries negotiating trade deals. Even with the turbulence, stocks have had a solid May. The S&P 500 is still up more than 6% this month, the Nasdaq Composite has jumped 10%, and the Dow has added about 4%. For this week alone, the S&P has risen 2%, the Dow gained 1.4%, and the Nasdaq is up 2.3%. Traders are also watching closely for inflation data. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index for April is expected to show annual inflation at 2.2%, with a monthly increase of 0.1%. The core PCE, which cuts out food and energy, is projected to come in at 2.6% for the year, also rising 0.1% month over month. Crypto drops as investors brace for inflation Crypto markets weren’t spared either. Bitcoin dropped 2.8% and now trades at $105,430. Ether fell 4% to $2,617, XRP dropped 4.4% to $2.19, and Solana (SOL) tumbled 6%, now sitting at $162. The declines come as traders try to make sense of global economic signals that are increasingly impossible to predict. Source: TradingView But interestingly enough, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is currently at 60, which is strongly Greed. Retail investors aren’t feeling good about any of it. The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) said bearish sentiment jumped to 41.9% this week, up from 36.7% last week. That’s higher than the long-term average of 31%, and this marks the 26th time in 28 weeks that pessimism has outpaced the norm. On the flip side, bullish sentiment dropped to 32.9%, down from 37.7%, and sits below the historical average of 37.5% for the 16th time in 17 weeks. In a special question, 64% of respondents said that the tariffs, along with the economy and inflation, are the top reasons they expect markets to drop in the next six months. Only 11% pointed to corporate earnings, 10% to valuations, and 9% to monetary policy or interest rates.

Bitcoin falls below $105K, eyes strong support around $104K. Altcoins retreat after gains, momentum weak across Ethereum and Solana. Most cryptocurrencies are trading lower today as market uncertainty grows following a U.S. court’s decision to strike down President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs. The global crypto market cap has fallen 2.56% to $3.35 trillion, though investor sentiment remains in the “Greed” zone with a score of 61 on the Fear & Greed Index. The market jitters stem from a recent U.S. trade court ruling that deemed Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs illegal. This development raised fresh concerns about the stability of the U.S. trade policy and whether $16 billion in collected tariffs might have to be refunded. However, in a quick turn of events, a federal appeals court has temporarily paused the lower court’s ruling, allowing Trump’s tariffs to stay in effect for now.

As per local media reports , during a recent meeting official meeting on Finance and Revenue, Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal clarified that although the prime minister has established a Crypto Council, led by the finance minister through an executive order to explore digital asset policy, the country’s cryptocurrency ban remains firmly in place under regulations set by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) The central bank issued a directive in 2024 declaring Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies illegal, a position that remains unchanged. Pakistan’s Crypto Council CEO Bilal Bin Saqib, who was recently named as PM’s assistant on crypto and blockchain , announced at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas that the country is moving ahead with a Bitcoin reserve . Officials Highlight Crypto Policy Inconsistency Committee members voiced concern over the government’s inconsistency in regards to crypto policy, questioning why the public was being encouraged to invest in crypto despite its legal ban, warning that such actions could expose investors to serious risks. Recently Pakistan’s government announced to allocate 2,000 megawatts of electricity to power Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence (AI) data centres. Committee members raised questions about whether the bitcoin mining would be in government or private sector hands, and noted that illegal hawala channels would likely be replaced by unregulated digital transfers.

In 2022, the SBP issued an official advisory urging the public to exercise caution and avoid trading in cryptocurrencies. The committee’s debate on cryptocurrency was sparked by a proposed bill on digital currency regulations introduced by MNA Sharmila Farooqi.

2025-05-30T08:49:36.000Z,"Michael Saylor Outlines Strategy’s Bear Market Playbook at Bitcoin Vegas","Disclaimer: The analyst who wrote this piece owns shares of Strategy (MSTR) At the Bitcoin conference in Las Vegas , Strategy (MSTR) Executive Chairman Michael Saylor was asked how the company would respond if its multiple to net asset value (mNAV) fell below 1, as it did during the previous bear market. In response, Saylor drew an analogy to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), stating, “GBTC is a closed-end trust… a corporate entity that has no operational flexibility to manage its capital structure.” He emphasized that unlike GBTC, Strategy is an operating business with the ability to take on debt and manage its capital dynamically. Saylor argued that “for any company to fall down to below 1 mNAV, the shareholders have lost faith in the management structure of the business.” If Strategy’s stock “went to $1 tomorrow,” he said, the company would respond by selling its preferred stock or fixed income instruments STRK and STRF and use the proceeds to repurchase common stock, thereby recapitalizing the company. Highlighting the importance of flexibility, Saylor stated, “To create value, you need to create option value to generate as much optionality as possible. The more options, the greater the value.” He concluded by asserting, “The thing that makes our company a monster is having multiple at-the-market offerings (ATMs) in multiple capital markets,” underscoring Strategy’s multi-channel access to liquidity and financial resilience.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/30/michael-saylor-outlines-strategys-bear-market-playbook-at-bitcoin-vegas,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|STRK","Markets|Bitcoin|MicroStrategy|News",cryptocompare
2025-05-30T08:48:07.000Z,"Bitcoin Trader Loses Nearly $100 Million in Hyperliquid Long Bet Liquidation","James Wynn, a high-stakes trader on Hyperliquid , has suffered a near-$100 million loss after a series of leveraged long positions on Bitcoin were liquidated during a sudden market dip. Wynn, known for his aggressive trading strategies, saw his bold bets collapse on May 30 as Bitcoin’s price fell sharply below $105,000. Nearly 1,000 BTC Liquidated in Hours According to on-chain data from analytics platform Hypurrscan, two of Wynn’s largest positions were closed in quick succession. The first, a 527.29 BTC long valued at $55.3 million, was liquidated when Bitcoin dropped to $104,950. Moments later, another 421.8 BTC worth $43.9 million was wiped out as Bitcoin slid further to $104,150. These losses came on the heels of another 94 BTC ($10 million) liquidation on May 29 at $106,330. In total, Wynn lost 949 BTC — equating to approximately $99.3 million. Data from Lookonchain confirmed Wynn’s total losses over the past week hover just below the $100 million mark. Bitcoin reached to $105,000 on May 30, with some platforms reporting even deeper lows. Wynn’s positions were exposed to massive downside risk, as he had increased his 40x leveraged bet to $1.25 billion just days earlier, on May 24. That gamble backfired when the market reacted to geopolitical uncertainty and renewed tariff rhetoric from U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump. Wynn: “I Stand to Lose Everything” Following the dramatic liquidations, Wynn responded on X with a cryptic screenshot from The Matrix showing Neo stopping bullets — a subtle nod to the pressure he faced. Despite the losses, one of Wynn’s massive positions remains open: a 40x leveraged long contract entered at $107,993. According to Hypurrscan, it is currently showing an unrealized loss of $3.4 million. Wynn, who rose to fame after turning memecoin investments — particularly Pepe — into multi-million-dollar wins, appears unfazed by the volatility. A day before the liquidation, he described himself as an “extreme degenerate” and admitted to ignoring risk management. “I do not follow proper risk management… I’m effectively gambling. And I stand to lose everything,” Wynn warned — a candid reflection of the high-risk world of crypto leverage trading.

2025-05-30T08:46:25.000Z,"Bitcoin ETF Inflow Streak Ends After $347M Outflow Day","This latest outflow was the largest single-day outflow since March and ended a 10-day inflow streak. Fidelity’s FBTC and Grayscale’s GBTC led the outflows, while BlackRock’s IBIT stood out with a $125 million net inflow—its 34th straight day of gains. Meanwhile, spot Ether ETFs were able to stay resilient by drawing $92 million in inflows despite many holders being underwater due to ETH’s price decline. However, recent court decisions easing trade tensions revived sentiment. BlackRock has also been quietly increasing Bitcoin exposure via internal bond portfolios. Bitcoin Price Drop Triggers ETF Outflows US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded their first collective outflow in over two weeks on May 29, snapping a ten-day streak of net inflows. This was also the largest single-day outflow since March. The total net outflow amounted to $347 million, according to data from Farside Investors. This reflected the shift in market sentiment after Bitcoin’s price dropped by more than 3.5% during the day. The sharp price decline saw BTC fall from an intraday high of $108,850 to briefly dip below $105,000. Bitcoin ETF flow (Source: Farside Investors ) Among the ETFs, the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) registered the largest outflow after losing $166 million. This was followed by the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which shed $107.5 million. Other funds managed by Bitwise, Ark 21Shares, Invesco, Franklin Templeton, and VanEck also saw net outflows. However, funds like Grayscale’s mini Bitcoin trust, CoinShares, and WisdomTree experienced no flows. The only ETF to defy the trend was BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which attracted a net inflow of $125 million on the day. This was the fund’s 34th consecutive trading day of inflows, a streak that began after its last outflow on April 9. With nearly $4 billion in net inflows over the past two weeks alone, IBIT’s total inflows now stand at $49 billion, and its assets under management have surpassed $70 billion. ETF Store President Nate Geraci pointed out the divergence between crypto and traditional asset flows, and explained that more than $9 billion has entered spot Bitcoin ETFs in the past five weeks while nearly $3 billion exited gold ETFs during the same period. Meanwhile, spot Ether ETFs were more resilient during the Bitcoin pullback by posting a net inflow of $92 million on May 29. This extended their own inflow streak to ten consecutive trading days. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) led the charge with $50 million in net inflows, raising its total to $4.5 billion since its launch in July of 2024. Ethereum ETF flow (Source: Farside Investors ) Ether ETF Investors Deep in the Red Most investors in spot Ether ETFs launched by BlackRock and Fidelity are currently sitting on big unrealized losses. This is according to a new report from crypto analytics firm Glassnode. The report from May 29 found that the average investor in BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust and Fidelity’s Ethereum ETF is now down around 21%, with cost bases of $3,300 and $3,500 respectively. Ether is currently trading at approximately $2,610, which is well below these entry points. The decline in ETH’s price is partially attributed to macroeconomic pressures, particularly after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order imposing tariffs on imports from China, Canada, and Mexico. Ether last traded above $3,000 on Feb. 2, before entering a prolonged downtrend. The downturn intensified in April when the crypto hit a yearly low of $1,472 on April 9. This was the same day Trump’s global tariff package took effect. Glassnode’s analysis mentioned that outflows from Ether ETFs tended to accelerate when the asset dropped below the average investor’s cost basis, particularly during price declines in August of 2024, January, and March of 2025. However, a recent recovery provided some relief. ETH rebounded more than 44% over the past month, driven in part by easing fears around the trade war. On May 28, a US federal court blocked most of Trump’s tariffs, fueling optimism and contributing to nine consecutive days of inflows into Ether ETFs. ETH’s price action over the past month (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Since their US debut in July 2024, spot Ether ETFs have attracted close to $2.94 billion in inflows. At the time of their launch on July 23, Ether was trading around $3,536. Despite this capital influx, Glassnode noticed that the ETFs have had only a modest effect on Ethereum’s spot price. Initially, they accounted for just 1.5% of spot market trading volume. That figure rose to 2.5% in November 2024, coinciding with Trump’s re-election and a broader rally across the crypto market that briefly pushed ETH to $4,007 on Dec. 8. Since then, the ETFs’ market share slid back toward 1.5%. BlackRock Quietly Boosts Bitcoin ETF Holdings BlackRock has been steadily increasing its exposure to Bitcoin through internal portfolio allocations. According to recent filings with the US SEC, BlackRock’s Strategic Income Opportunities Portfolio held 2,123,592 shares of its own iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as of March 31, 2025. The position was valued at $99.4 million, which is a big increase from the 1,691,143 shares it held at the end of 2024. This move proved that Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a component of diversified return strategies, even in traditionally bond-heavy portfolios. The iShares Bitcoin Trust was launched in January of 2024 after the SEC’s approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs. It also very quickly became the dominant fund in its category. It currently manages over $70 billion in net assets, far outpacing its nearest competitor, Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), which trails by $50 billion. The Strategic Income Opportunities Portfolio is primarily focused on bonds but includes a mandate for seeking higher returns through exposure to a broad array of markets, including digital assets like Bitcoin. Institutional demand for Bitcoin ETFs are quite strong, with 2025 on track to mirror the explosive growth that was seen during the products’ first year. May has been particularly impressive, with spot Bitcoin ETFs attracting over $1.5 billion in net inflows in just two days. BlackRock’s IBIT played a central role in this trend by consistently recording sizable inflows since April 9. (Source: Bitwise ) Looking ahead, Bitwise Asset Management sees continued upside. In a recent report , its analysts projected that Bitcoin ETF inflows could reach $120 billion this year and potentially rise to $300 billion by 2026. Despite this robust growth, a major opportunity remains untapped. Bitwise shared that many traditional wealth management platforms and large wirehouses have not embraced Bitcoin ETFs just yet, which leaves a lot of room for even more institutional adoption in the coming years.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9373/bitcoin-etf-inflow-streak-ends-after-347-m-outflow-day,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-05-30T08:45:10.000Z,"India to drop a crypto regulation paper in June","India is reportedly set to drop a major discussion paper in June on crypto regulation. For a country that has hobbled between hardline tax moves and regulatory silence, this looks like a big shift. It is also a major signal that the government is warming up to the sector as industry prints fresh all-time highs (ATH). US President Donald Trump’s bold pro-crypto stance and the ongoing tariff tussle have led the global digital asset market to print green indexes. Bitcoin, the biggest crypto, smashed its new ATH of over $111,900 on May 22 before retracing back to the $105K levels. India to unveil crypto plan soon According to reports, the paper, which is expected to be released by India, will pull heavily from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) synthesis report. It might open the door for public input on how the country should handle the practices adopted by other jurisdictions. India’s take on crypto has been in the grey zone, as the Financial Year 23 budget imposed a harsh 30% tax on crypto gains, it stopped short of giving the sector legal recognition. Regulators have since forced exchanges to register with India’s Financial Intelligence Unit. Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of India has repeatedly flagged risks like money laundering and terror financing and even pushed its own CBDC as the safer option. The report mentioned that a senior government official said India will make its crypto decisions based on national interest, avoiding any “knee-jerk” reactions given the sector’s massive implications. Earlier, the Supreme Court of India slammed the central government for its long silence on crypto regulation. It warned that this legal vacuum is turning into a breeding ground for misuse. The court even grilled the government over when the biggest global economies are pushing forward with regulatory frameworks and India still hasn’t introduced any clear rules. A new report from think tank Esya Centre estimates that nearly 90% of Indian crypto trading has shifted offshore as a direct result of these regulations. It has eroded India’s foothold in the fast-expanding global crypto economy. Industry leaders warn that the current tax structure stifles innovation, pushes users toward unregulated markets. India’s top court demands crypto rules The US is doing some major reforms for the crypto community. Once a vocal crypto skeptic under Biden, Trump’s administration has pardoned several digital assets industry leaders and launched a strategic bitcoin reserve, and is pushing Congress to pass pro-crypto laws. Recently, Trump’s Senate passed stablecoin legislation; on the other hand, the EU’s MiCA regulation is already rolling out in real time. Against this backdrop, India’s Supreme Court said that it’s no longer acceptable to keep dodging the issue. A bench led by Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh highlighted that banning crypto isn’t the answer, but regulation is urgently needed. The cumulative crypto market cap registered a drop of more than 3% on Friday morning to stand at $3.31 trillion. Its 24-hour trading volume stood at $142.3 billion. After a brief rally, the Bitcoin price has stayed down by 5% over the past 7 days. One of the biggest gainers of the year, Ripple’s XRP price dropped by a huge 10% in the same period.

Keonne Rodriguez and William Hill, charged with operating an unlicensed money transmitting business and conspiracy to commit money laundering, filed a joint motion asking a federal judge in Manhattan to dismiss the indictment. The pair's lawyers say Samourai Wallet never handled user funds and shouldn’t be considered a financial institution or a money transmitter under federal law. At the heart of the dispute is the distinction between custodial services, which take control of customer assets, and non-custodial tools like Samourai, which merely help users obscure blockchain transactions using a method called CoinJoin. According to the motion, Samourai users always retained control of their crypto, and the app simply coordinated privacy-enhancing transactions among them. The developers’ defense cited longstanding guidance from the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), that anonymizing software providers are not subject to money transmitter rules. “FinCEN never maintained that it was a money transmitting business that must be licensed. To the contrary, FinCEN consistently advised that companies and software apps that did not “accept” or “transmit” funds were not “money transmitting” businesses,” the filing reads. The defense argues that the Department of Justice’s charges mark a sharp and unprecedented break from that interpretation “in an apparent regulatory power struggle with FinCEN.” To them, the DOJ’s conduct is akin to “charging a shovel manufacturer because it may know murderers use shovels to bury victims” or “charging a burner phone manufacturer because it may know some customers use the phones to facilitate drug crimes.” In the motion, the lawyers warned that the DOJ’s theory could implicate a wide range of developers building privacy tools. Several crypto advocacy groups, including Coin Center and the DeFi Education Fund, have signaled interest in filing amicus briefs in support of the motion, warning that the case could chill innovation and infringe on civil liberties if allowed to proceed. The court is scheduled to hear arguments on July 22.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/05/30/samourai-wallet-files-to-dismiss-doj-case-citing-fincen-guidance,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY","Policy|Samourai Wallet|DOJ|lawsuits|US|News",cryptocompare

2025-05-30T08:15:16.000Z,"BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Reaches Record Low Volatility, Draws Billions in Flows","BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust exchange-traded fund (IBIT) is experiencing record-low volatility, according to Senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas , which is attracting more interest from larger investors looking for a \""digital gold\"" rather than speculative tech-like behavior. The 90-day rolling volatility of 47.64 is the lowest since the ETF was introduced in January 2024, Balchunas posted on X, a degree of stability that can be self-reinforcing. As volatility drops, larger and more risk-averse investors tend to enter, which in turn further suppresses volatility. \""The thing with volatility is it can become self-fulfilling,\"" Balchunas said in his post. \""The lower the volatility gets, the more bigger investors will bite who will help lower volatility even more. The same 'should' happen with correlation too. This is a direct result of the ‘suitcoiners.’” The trend is already underway, Balchunas said, citing IBIT’s outsized inflows in recent weeks. Since its debut, IBIT has pulled in $49 billion in net inflows, more than four times the amount invested into the second-ranked Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), which has attracted less than $12 billion, data from Farside Investors show. In contrast, Strategy (MSTR), the software company that has made buying bitcoin BTC a strategic priority, operates on a different appeal. MSTR attracts speculators and options traders who thrive on higher implied volatility (IV). However, even MSTR’s IV has dipped recently to 60%, with historical volatility at 49%, contributing to its muted price action .",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/30/blackrocks-bitcoin-etf-reaches-record-low-volatility-draws-billions-in-flows,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY","Markets|Bitcoin|Bitcoin ETF|Volatility|BlackRock|News",cryptocompare
2025-05-30T08:15:00.000Z,"Bitcoin price prediction 2025-2031: Will BTC hit $150k soon?","Key takeaways : Bitcoin price faces bearish correction toward $105K Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Ticker BTC Price $105,804 (-2%) Market cap $2.19 Trillion Trading volume (24-hour) $56.76 Billion (-38%) Circulating supply 19.86 Million BTC All-time high $111,970; May 22, 2025 All-time low $0.04865; Jul 15, 2010 24-hour high $108,910.55 24-hour low $104,684.72 Bitcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $110,019 Price Prediction $119,922 (+8.01%) Fear & Greed Index 78 (Extreme Greed) Sentiment Bullish Price Volatility (30-day variation) 5.04% Green Days 17/30 (60%) 50-Day SMA $93,698 200-Day SMA $86,424 14-Day RSI 77.24 Bitcoin price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: BTC price analysis shows that Bitcoin faced a rejection around $109K and triggered a decline. Resistance for BTC is at $108,944 Support for BTC/USD is at $104,718 The BTC price analysis for 30 May confirms that BTC faces a surge in bearish volatility as the price rejected the $109K level. As a result, sellers pushed the price toward immediate support channels below $106K. BTC price analysis 1-day chart: Bitcoin price hovers below $106K Analyzing the daily Bitcoin price chart, we see that BTC faced a surge toward $109K. However, sellers strongly defended further surges, resulting in a bearish correction below Fib channels toward $105K. The 24-hour volume has surged to $2.3 billion, showing a rise in trading interest today. BTC is trading at $105,804, declining by over 2% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin shows bearish volatility The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level but trades above the midline at 54, hinting that a bullish correction is on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. BTC/USD 4-hour price chart: Buyers strongly defend $105K support The 4-hour Bitcoin price chart suggests that bears are strengthening their position to hold the price below the $105K level. However, buyers strongly defended the decline below $105K, holding the price around EMA20 trend line. Bitcoin aims for immediate correction The BoP indicator trades in a bullish region at 0.42, showing that short-term buyers are taking a chance to accelerate an upward trend. However, the MACD trend line has formed red candles below the signal line, and the indicator aims for negative momentum, strengthening short-position holders’ confidence.

The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC’s price holds momentum above $108,944, it will fuel a bullish rally to $112,255. BTC/USDT Chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $104,718, beginning a bearish trend to $102,183. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin down today? Bitcoin faced a surge in bearish pressure after the price peaked at $109K. This triggered short-term holders to exit their positions, resulting in the recent decline. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price recently broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $100K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Following the US, Pakistan announced its first government-backed strategic bitcoin reserve, marking a notable step towards adding crypto assets into its financial strategy. Bitcoin price prediction May 2025 Bitcoin’s Q1 2025 performance was notably weak, with a 12.5% loss, as per CoinGlass data, marking the worst first quarter since 2018. In the last few weeks of April, the price of Bitcoin recovered smoothly and touched a high around $95K. Will Bitcoin continue its recovery rally in May? Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $91,000 and be pushed further, at least $108,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $85,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction May 2025 $85,000 $91,000 $108,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history | Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-price-prediction/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|UNI","Crypto Price Predictions|BTC",cryptocompare
2025-05-30T08:14:12.000Z,"Dogecoin Dives 9%; Cardano’s ADA, SOL Slump 6% as Renewed Tariff Fears Jolt Markets","Dogecoin DOGE nosedived 9%, while Cardano’s ADA ADA and Solana’s SOL SOL each fell 6% in the past 24 hours as Trump’s reinstated tariffs reignited trade tensions. A swift legal reversal saw the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issue a temporary stay on Wednesday’s lower court ruling that had struck down the tariffs, allowing them to remain in place while the government appeals. The tariffs, announced on April 2 and dubbed “Liberation Day” duties by Trump, target nearly all U.S. trading partners and were imposed under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Bitcoin BTC slid below $106,000 while ether ETH lost the $2,700 mark amid the renewed uncertainty. The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid index tracking the largest tokens by market capitalization, fell 4%. “The price of Bitcoin fell after Trump’s tariffs were reinstated by an appeals court, while U.S. GDP figures showed the economy shrank in the first quarter,” said Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, in a Telegram message. “Gold surged higher as jobless claims increased and corporate profits fell. Although the Fed continues to see inflation as a threat, we’re optimistic that Bitcoin will rebound as investors look for long-term value holds during volatile market fluctuations,” Ruck added. Market sentiment appeared cautious, with the total crypto market capitalization flat at $3.42 trillion. “Cryptocurrencies prefer not to notice positive stock market movements as they are related to tariffs and company reports, not money supply,” noted Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FxPro, in an email to CoinDesk. “Bitcoin retreated from the trading range’s upper boundary at $110k to its lower boundary at $107K. This rest at previous highs effectively removes the local overheating of the market.”",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/30/dogecoin-dives-9-cardanos-ada-sol-slump-6-as-renewed-tariff-fears-jolt-markets,"ADA|BTC|DOGE|MARKET|SOL","Markets|Dogecoin|Cardano|Solana|market analysis|News",cryptocompare

2025-05-30T08:10:59.000Z,"Solana price prediction: here’s why SOL is crashing and what next","Solana price has come under pressure this week as the crypto market crash accelerated. After peaking at $187 last week, the coin has pulled back to $159, and there are signs that the sell-off will gain steam. SOL was trading at $164.2 on Friday, down by 45% from the highest point this month. Solana price technical analysis The daily chart shows that the SOL price is at risk of further downwside in the coming days. That’s because the coin has formed a double-top pattern at $184.5 on the twelve-hour chart. This pattern is made up of two peaks and a neckline, which, in this case, is at $159.45. A double-top pattern is one of the most accurate chart patterns in technical analysis as it sends a signal that investors are afraid to buy an asset above a certain price. In Solana’s case, investors are afraid of placing bids above the double-top point at $184.5 and the 50% Fibonacci Retracement level at $195. Read more: Crypto price predictions today: Popcat, Worldcoin, Zebec Network It has moved below the 50-period moving average, a sign that bears are in control for now. Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and other oscillators have all pointed downwards, signaling that the downtrend is continuing. The distance between the upper side of the double-top and the neckline is about 14%. Measuring the same distance from the neckline brings the target price to $136, which is a few points below the 23.6% retracement point. The bearish Solana price forecast will be invalidated if it moves above the resistance point at $184.5. SOL price chart | Source: TradingView Why SOL is plunging There are a few reasons why the Solana price is in a downward trend. First, the decline is because of the ongoing crypto market crash , with Bitcoin falling from $111,900 last week to $106,000 today. A Bitcoin retreat often leads to more downside among most altcoins, including Solana. Second, investors are dumping Solana meme coins. CoinGecko data shows that the market cap of all Solana meme coins has dropped from over $15 billion last week to over $11.4 billion today. Most of them, have tumbled in the last few days, with Fartcoin falling by 28% in the last seven days and Dogwifhat dropping by 18%. Other top Solana meme coins like Bonk, Pudgy Penguins, Popcat, and Cat in a dogs world have all plunged by over 20%. This plunge has had an impact on Solana’s ecosystem, with the 24-hour volume in its DEX protocols falling from to $2.23 billion. Those in the BSC Chain and Ethereum handled $12.3 billion and $3.4 billion. The total supply of stablecoins in Solana’s network continues falling. It moved from a high of $13 billion earlier this month to $11.5 billion, and the trend is continuing. Additionally, Solana’s funding rate has turned negative, a sign that investors expect the future price to be lower than the current one. Therefore, a combination of tough macroeconomic news on trade, coupled with weak internal numbers mean that the Solana price will continue falling in the near term. Besides, June is usually the worst month for cryptocurrencies.

Having already taken a pro-crypto stance, Vance believes the U.S. stands to leap big if it moves with haste in this sector. He noted, “The People's Republic of China doesn't like Bitcoin. Well, we should be asking ourselves, why is that? Why is our biggest adversary such an opponent of bitcoin, and if the communist Republic of China is leaning away from Bitcoin, then maybe the United States ought to be leaning into Bitcoin.” Having risen to presidency on the crypto wave, Donald Trump has steadfastly aired his commitment to promote growth in the crypto industry by enhancing adopting and easing regulations. For instance, Senator Cynthia Lummis announced at the same conference that President Trump was in high gear to support the BITCOIN Act, which could see the U.S. government purchase one million Bitcoin. Bitcoin Being Part of the Mainstream Economy Already a crypto investor with Bitcoin worth between $250,000 and $500,000 , Vance believes that the apex cryptocurrency should be entrenched in the mainstream economy. While addressing the crowd at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference, he acknowledged that crypto is here to stay and they should be seen as a hedge against bad governance and policy making. He added, “It's a hedge against skyrocketing inflation, which has eroded the real savings rates of Americans over the last four years. And as you all know well, it's a hedge against a private sector that's increasingly willing to discriminate against consumers on the basis of their basic beliefs, including their politics.” Vance also touched on the significance of the stablecoin market, highlighting that the Trump administration does not perceive it as a threat to the U.S. dollar, but sees it as an economic force multiplier. In this case, he urged Congress to roll their sleeves and okay the GENIUS Act , which could clear the air about stablecoins’ regulatory framework Why the U.S. Wants to Take the National Bitcoin Reserve Route Establishing a national Bitcoin reserve would not only safeguard U.S. financial sovereignty but also position the country at the forefront of the digital monetary era. First and foremost, Bitcoin is emerging as a globally recognized store of value. Much like gold, Bitcoin is scarce—capped at 21 million coins—making it resistant to inflationary pressures that plague fiat currencies. In a world where central banks are printing unprecedented amounts of money, holding Bitcoin can act as a hedge against devaluation of the U.S. dollar, especially in times of economic uncertainty or geopolitical tension. Second, Bitcoin can serve as a geopolitical tool. Nations like El Salvador and institutions around the world are already integrating Bitcoin into their financial strategies. If adversarial or competing countries were to accumulate substantial Bitcoin reserves first, they could gain significant leverage in global financial negotiations. A U.S. Bitcoin reserve would mitigate this risk and strengthen the country’s economic position in an increasingly multipolar financial system. Furthermore, Bitcoin promotes financial transparency and decentralization. Unlike traditional reserves such as gold or foreign currency, Bitcoin holdings can be publicly audited on the blockchain. This transparency could increase public trust in national monetary policy and help reduce inefficiencies and corruption. Economically, investing in Bitcoin has the potential for long-term capital appreciation. Early adoption could yield significant returns, helping to offset national debt or fund future technological innovation. It would also signal the U.S.’s commitment to supporting Web3 innovation and digital financial infrastructure, encouraging startups, attracting talent, and reinforcing the country’s leadership in technology. Finally, a national Bitcoin reserve would act as a strategic insurance policy against the decline of traditional fiat systems. As trust in legacy institutions erodes, the ability to pivot to decentralized monetary alternatives could become crucial for national resilience. In short, a national Bitcoin reserve is not merely a financial decision—it’s a strategic imperative. It ensures the U.S. remains adaptive, secure, and competitive in the digital age. Delay could mean ceding economic leadership to nations better prepared for a decentralized financial future.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9374/jd-vance-calls-national-bitcoin-reserve-a-strategic-priority,"ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|REGULATION","News",cryptocompare

And as you all know well, it's a hedge against a private sector that's increasingly willing to discriminate against consumers on the basis of their basic beliefs, including their politics.” Vance also touched on the significance of the stablecoin market, highlighting that the Trump administration does not perceive it as a threat to the U.S. dollar, but sees it as an economic force multiplier. In this case, he urged Congress to roll their sleeves and okay the GENIUS Act , which could clear the air about stablecoins’ regulatory framework Why the U.S. Wants to Take the National Bitcoin Reserve Route Establishing a national Bitcoin reserve would not only safeguard U.S. financial sovereignty but also position the country at the forefront of the digital monetary era. First and foremost, Bitcoin is emerging as a globally recognized store of value. Much like gold, Bitcoin is scarce—capped at 21 million coins—making it resistant to inflationary pressures that plague fiat currencies. In a world where central banks are printing unprecedented amounts of money, holding Bitcoin can act as a hedge against devaluation of the U.S. dollar, especially in times of economic uncertainty or geopolitical tension. Second, Bitcoin can serve as a geopolitical tool. Nations like El Salvador and institutions around the world are already integrating Bitcoin into their financial strategies. If adversarial or competing countries were to accumulate substantial Bitcoin reserves first, they could gain significant leverage in global financial negotiations. A U.S. Bitcoin reserve would mitigate this risk and strengthen the country’s economic position in an increasingly multipolar financial system. Furthermore, Bitcoin promotes financial transparency and decentralization. Unlike traditional reserves such as gold or foreign currency, Bitcoin holdings can be publicly audited on the blockchain. This transparency could increase public trust in national monetary policy and help reduce inefficiencies and corruption. Economically, investing in Bitcoin has the potential for long-term capital appreciation. Early adoption could yield significant returns, helping to offset national debt or fund future technological innovation. It would also signal the U.S.’s commitment to supporting Web3 innovation and digital financial infrastructure, encouraging startups, attracting talent, and reinforcing the country’s leadership in technology. Finally, a national Bitcoin reserve would act as a strategic insurance policy against the decline of traditional fiat systems. As trust in legacy institutions erodes, the ability to pivot to decentralized monetary alternatives could become crucial for national resilience. In short, a national Bitcoin reserve is not merely a financial decision—it’s a strategic imperative. It ensures the U.S. remains adaptive, secure, and competitive in the digital age. Delay could mean ceding economic leadership to nations better prepared for a decentralized financial future.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9374/vice-president-jd-vance-calls-national-bitcoin-reserve-a-strategic-priority,"ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|REGULATION","News",cryptocompare
2025-05-30T08:04:07.000Z,"Arthur Hayes Reveals His 2025 Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction! \""Ethereum Is The Most Hated Altcoin Right Now, But…\""","Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes, who attracted attention with his bold and ambitious statements about Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins, made important statements about Ethereum. Speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference, Arthur Hayes predicted that Ethereum could reach $5,000 this year. Hayes argued that Ethereum could potentially reach a new all-time high despite its recent underperformance compared to rival cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Solana (SOL). The celebrity said that ETH is currently the most hated layer-1 blockchain and that historically the most disliked assets tend to provide the best returns when market cycles turn. According to Hayes, this suggests that ETH could double and outperform. “I think ETH could go to $4,000 or $5,000 this year. “I think ETH is the most hated tier-1 asset right now. And usually at some point in the cycle you want to be in the most hated asset, so I think ETH could outperform.” Apart from Hayes, Geoffrey Kendrick, Head of Digital Assets at Standard Chartered, also stated that he has an bullish expectation for Etheruem and shared that he has a price target of $4,000 for 2025 and $7,500 for 2029. As a result, a jump to $4,000, which is seen as the common denominator and lower bound of Kendrick and Hayes’ price prediction range, would represent a jump of approximately 50% from ETH’s current price of $2,640. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-30T08:03:43.000Z,"Two Ways This Bitcoin Bull Market is Sturdier Than 2020-21 and 2017","Bitcoin BTC has long been criticized for its high volatility, with bull runs marked by sudden, sharp pullbacks that would qualify as full-blown bear trends in stocks. However, the latest bull market, which kicked off in early 2023, feels different in a positive way, exhibiting relatively low volatility and drawdowns. Volatility in downtrend According to data tracked by Glassnode, bitcoin's realized volatility on a three-month rolling basis has averaged less than 50% during this bull cycle, significantly lower than the 80% to 100% observed during previous bull runs. The same thing can be said about the 30-day implied volatility, tracked by Volmex's BVIV index, which has been in a downtrend, according to data source TradingView. The implied volatility refers to the expected price turbulence over a specific period and is a forward-looking metric. The stability likely stems from bitcoin's ever-growing market capitalization, which inadvertently fosters stability and increased institutional participation through ETFs and derivatives. \""Boasting a market capitalization of over $2T, Bitcoin now ranks as the 7th largest asset worldwide. As liquidity deepens, and the valuation of an asset reaches these heights, the capital required to meaningfully move the price of the asset becomes significantly larger,\"" Glassnode said, explaining the volatility meltdown. \""Additionally, the launch of the US Spot ETF Products, supplemented by increasing regulatory clarity, has altered the underlying composition of the investor base, allowing sophisticated, institutional investors and capital to gain exposure to bitcoin for the first time,\"" Glassnode added. Stair-step rally Pull up the price chart from 2020-21, and you'll see that bitcoin's then-bull run from $4,000 to $70,000 had several steep price pullbacks, sometimes more than 30%. In traditional markets, a drawdown of over 20% is typically considered a bear market. Now compare it to the rally from roughly $30,000 to over $100,000 since March 2023, and the picture looks different. It has been a stair-step ascent, characterized by an impulsive move higher followed by broad accumulation ranges that set the stage for the next leg higher. \""We’ve observed a shallower drawdown profile relative to previous bull markets, with the current cycle drawdowns generally less than -25% from the local high, with only two instances exceeding -30%,\"" Glassnode said. The change in character is again linked to institutional participation, lower leverage and speculative excesses in the broader market. Major exchanges, including Binance, offered 100X leverage during the previous bull runs, allowing investors to control a significantly larger trading position. Such use of leverage helped investors juice up profits but also magnified losses, resulting in liquidation cascades and frequent double-digit price corrections. However, exchanges eventually cut down the leverage significantly, curbing speculative excesses. That seems to have contributed to the sturdier rally this time.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/30/two-ways-this-bitcoin-bull-market-is-sturdier-than-2020-21-and-2017,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX","Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|market analysis|News",cryptocompare
2025-05-30T08:00:24.000Z,"Ethereum Repeating Early 2024’s Playbook – $3,800 Target In Sight?","This week, Ethereum (ETH) has reclaimed the $2,600 level as support for the first time since February, and it’s pushing to retest the next key resistance after a breakout from a short-term pattern. Some analysts suggest that ETH’s rally could target its Macro Range high area in the coming weeks. Ethereum Resembles 2024 Setup After struggling to break past the $2,600 mark, Ethereum has reclaimed this level as support. Over the past two days, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has held this key level while attempting to break above the $2,700 mark. Since recovering from its sub-$2,000 dip earlier this month, ETH hovered between $2,400 and $2,600, failing to reclaim the range’s upper zone despite its $2,738 multi-month high on May 10. Nonetheless, this week’s rally has seen the cryptocurrency rise above its local range and attempt to gain more strength to stop its sideways trajectory and continue its 50% recovery rally. Analyst Titan of Crypto noted that ETH just broke out of a two-week bullish flag, leading to today’s surge to the $2,788 level. He suggested that if the breakout is confirmed, the pattern’s target sits around the $3,800 level. Crypto Jelle pointed out that Ethereum is “still moving as planned, pushing deeper into the resistance area” around the $2,850 mark. Several analysts have named this level as the resistance before the $3,000 mark, and the wall “standing in the way of altseason.” Rekt Capital highlighted that Ethereum has been successfully retesting a crucial horizontal level since re-entering its $2,220-$3,900 Macro Range. Notably, Ethereum has been closing above the $2,468 mark for the past four weeks, setting up the stage for a “lift across the range.” With this successful retest, the King of Altcoins is “repeating early 2024 history.” Notably, ETH recorded a 50% four-week breakout after smashing the $2,486 resistance and retesting it as support. However, “the only difference is that it has just taken longer this time,” the analyst added. ETH Gains Momentum Meanwhile, analyst Ted Pillows considers that ETH is showing strength as its trading pair against Bitcoin (BTC) gains momentum and BTC dominance motion seemingly fades. The analyst also noted the ETH’s Weekly MACD bullish cross and reclaim of its multi-year support trendline. Based on this, he forecasted that Ethereum could soon soar to the $4,000 resistance. It’s worth noting that Ethereum is outperforming the flagship cryptocurrency this quarter for the first time since 2022, registering a 45% increase since April 1. Additionally, ETH continues to hold above its key level despite BTC’s dip below the $106,800 support. Related Reading: Bitcoin $106,800 Support Retest To Determine Next Move – Breakout Or Breakdown Ahead? Merlijn The Trader highlighted ETH’s price action after its golden cross, which appears to resemble its performance from the last time the setup occurred. According to the post, during the November 2024 setup, Ethereum saw a small dip before a “massive pump” on the eleventh day. “This time? Pump already started. We’re right on schedule,” the trader affirmed. As of this writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,642, a 44.7% increase in the monthly timeframe.

2025-05-30T07:48:22.000Z,"How Will the Crypto Market React to Bitcoin & Ethereum Options Expiry Today?","The post How Will the Crypto Market React to Bitcoin & Ethereum Options Expiry Today? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is bracing for a big event today, just one day after the Bitcoin Conference 2025 wrapped up in Las Vegas on May 29. The conference, filled with optimism and new ideas, has set a hopeful tone. But now, with more than $11 billion in Bitcoin and Ethereum options expiring today, traders are worried that this will lead to massive volatility ahead. $9.8B Bitcoin Options Expiry Today According to data from Deribit , a leading crypto derivatives platform, around 92,459 Bitcoin contracts will expire today. These contracts are worth nearly $9.8 billion, a significant jump from last week’s figures. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at around $105,982, down about 1.9% in the past 24 hours. The maximum pain price, the level where most options lose money, is $100,000. Although this is below the current price, analysts think Bitcoin won’t drop all the way to that level. Traders have set a put-to-call ratio of 0.89, showing more bets on price gains. $1.6 Billion Ethereum Options Expiry Ethereum is also seeing a big expiry day, with 623,949 contracts worth about $1.6 billion set to expire today, again according to Deribit data. Ethereum’s price is currently at $2,600, down about 4% in the past 24 hours. Its maximum pain price is $2,300, while the put-to-call ratio of 0.81 suggests that traders still believe prices could go higher. How the Crypto Market Could React Today This week’s Bitcoin and Ethereum options expiry is much bigger, covering the whole month. Historically, big monthly expiries like this can lead to short-term volatility, as traders adjust their positions or hedge against sudden price swings. Meanwhile, Bitcoin traders seem split, as some hope for a price rise, while others are cautious and ready to protect themselves. On the other hand Ethereum’s market looks balanced, with chances to grow but also some caution. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

An affiliate of the investment bank in April teamed up with Tether Holdings and SoftBank Group to launch Bitcoin accumulator Twenty One Capital Inc . Following a string of corporate implosions in 2022, including Celsius and BlockFi, there has been a surge in crypto-backed lending. For instance, in March, Bitcoin software firm Blockstream Corp. secured a multi-billion dollar investment in its crypto lending funds. David Mercer, chief executive of the institutional trading platform LMAX Group, told Bloomberg that the new lenders will be “much more institutional in nature.” “More banks will enter the space and provide credit mechanisms to some of the largest institutions you can imagine to trade these assets.” The post Cantor Fitzgerald Asset Management to Launch Gold-Hedged Bitcoin Fund appeared first on Cryptonews .",cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/cantor-fitzgerald-asset-management-to-launch-gold-hedged-bitcoin-fund/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING","Bitcoin News|Bitcoin|Gold",cryptocompare

2025-05-30T07:30:47.000Z,"Ross Ulbricht Gets Hero’s Welcome at Bitcoin 2025, Says ‘Fight for Freedom isn’t Over’","Ross Ulbricht made his first public appearance at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas as a free man, after spending over a decade in prison for his role in running the darknet website Silk Road, before U.S. President Trump pardoned him . An emotional Ross thanked the Bitcoin community for its continuous support. On 29 May 2015, a federal judge had sent Ross to serve a double-life sentence plus 40 years in prison without the possiblity of parole. Silk Road founder reflected on his time in prison saying, “there were days when I thought I would die in that awful cage,” but he fought to find joy even in the darkest time. Addressing the attendees, Ross said that the idea he risked his life and lost freedom for, grew into a movement. A movement so big that a decade later it came back around to free him, he added. “There is still more freedom to be won” Ross revealed that after he appeared at Bitcoin conference in 2021 through a phone call from prison, he was thrown into solitary confinement and put under heavy surveillance. But he said it was worth it and it made him feel like that for a moment he broke through the prison. “Today is the mirror image of that,” he noted. Talking about winning back his freedom, he said, “winning your freedom feels as amazing as losing it feels awful.” Ross declared from the stage that we’re not there yet, there is still more freedom to be won and there’s still more work to be done. “Freedom is worth the struggle,” he added. Ross is catching up with latest technology Ross Ulbricht is still catching up with the technology after coming out of a “time capsule.” He noted: “I effectively went into a time capsule in 2013 and now I’m coming out like Rip Van Winkle. I mean, just a few months ago when I walked out of prison, I’d never seen a drone. I had never experienced VR or chatted with AI.” Talking about the developments in the crypto industry since he went to prison, Ross said, when he launched Silk Road there was just one exchange you could buy bitcoin on. “Now, it seems like every app I download has a built-in wallet with one-click buying options.” He added that There are dozens of new cryptocurrencies and blockchains, each one fascinating in its own right. “There’s DeFi and Web 3 and now there’s AI to help me navigate it all. It’s nuts.” In a heartfelt video montage that played before he took the stage, scenes of Ulbricht adjusting to life beyond prison filled the screen. He was seen walking on the beach, learning to surf, sharing quiet moments with his wife and enjoying the newfound freedom. “Freedom, decentralization and unity” Ross concluded his speech by reminding the bitcoin community about the three core principles that they should stick by to grow further – freedom, decentralization and unity. Recalling his time in prison, Ross said that guards and administration like when prisoners are divided, that way it’s easier to rule them. But when the prisoners were united, the administration listened, he added. “When we all went on hunger strike together, they showed up and listened.” Ross urged the crypto community to not see each other as enemies. “So long as we can agree that we deserve freedom and that decentralization is how we secure it, then we can be united, we can have each other’s backs, just like you had mine, freedom, decentralization, unity. Stay true to these principles and the future is ours.” The post Ross Ulbricht Gets Hero’s Welcome at Bitcoin 2025, Says ‘Fight for Freedom isn’t Over’ appeared first on Cryptonews .",cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/ross-ulbricht-gets-heros-welcome-at-bitcoin-2025/,"BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY","Bitcoin News|Bitcoin|Ross Ulbricht",cryptocompare

Hence, we expect the BTC price to create a 2025 high of ~$168,000. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $71,827.81 $119,713.02 $167,598.22 Bitcoin Price Prediction June 2025 In May 2025, Bitcoin’s unstoppable ascent showed a nice and steady rise. This recovery was possible due to easing tensions from the trade tariffs war, which led BTC to surge to a new all-time high of $112K. The price fell back recently as a post by Donald Trump brought back the trade tensions with european union this time, which led to a brief dip to $108K. But, 48 hours later he paused the recent impose with EU until June 9th.This move stopped the situation to get worsened. However, despite that, bears took it down to $105K, and recently it is taking 20-day EMA support. When the pause was announced, it seemed like the positivity and bullish narratives would quickly return to the table from crypto traders, and it would take out the $112K resistance, but the bulls’ strength felt short to flip $112K.. Now, in the past couple of days, its price action is withdrawing back from its all-time high level, and it seems like it is on the verge of falling to the 50-day EMA band in the short term, around $ 100 K. Also, the Market sentiment has shifted from optimistic to pessimistic. The BTC long/short ratio currently stands at 0.9501, which has declined from 1.0288, indicating that bulls have weakened. This shows that bullish forces have halted the momentum in the short term, and bears are not on the sidelines anymore; they are kicking in to push the price lower. However, if a situation changes in the short term and bearishness wanes, then the newly formed all-time high must be taken out. If it does, then it will enter price discovery mode. In that condition, BTC could target a near-term target of $120,000, with the potential for even higher levels in the coming months. However, if bulls fail toreignite momentum then a pullback to $100,000 or lower, could be likely. Supporting this cautious view, on-chain data reveals that a substantial amount of dormant Bitcoin, unmoved for 1 to 2 years, 180-days to 1year, and 90-days to 180 days has recently become active. This kind of movement is often interpreted as a bearish signal, suggesting that short-term holders below 2 years might be preparing to sell. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 A key factor driving the potential for higher Bitcoin prices is the relationship with global liquidity. Historical trends reveal that as global M2 increases, Bitcoin often experiences dramatic price surges. Now, with global liquidity beginning to rise again after a prolonged period of stagnation, the stage seems set for another major rally in Bitcoin’s value. This shift in liquidity could create the perfect environment for Bitcoin to soar once more. Also, cryptoquant data suggest that accumulation is on top with exchange reserve declining at more alarming rates. When writing 2.4 Milliion BTC were in total on the exchange reserves, which is a strong decline from a year ago when reserves were 3.1 Million BTC. Source: CryptoQuant Talking about Bitcoin Price Prediction, if things turn bullish, BTC is expected to create a high of $175K. If things go south, we can expect a low of $70K.

2025-05-30T07:20:12.000Z,"Pantera Capital’s Smart Strategy: Investing in Companies with Crypto Reserves","BitcoinWorld Pantera Capital’s Smart Strategy: Investing in Companies with Crypto Reserves Are you curious about how major players in the crypto space are navigating the market? Investment strategies are constantly evolving, and Pantera Capital, a prominent name in cryptocurrency investment, recently revealed a fascinating approach. They are looking beyond direct investment in digital assets and putting capital into publicly listed companies that hold significant crypto reserves on their balance sheets. This move signals a growing trend in how institutional players view and interact with the digital asset ecosystem. Why are Companies Building Crypto Reserves ? The idea of a company holding cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum as part of its corporate treasury might seem unconventional to some, but it’s a strategy gaining traction. Companies adopt this approach for various reasons: Inflation Hedge: With concerns about fiat currency devaluation, some companies see assets like Bitcoin as a potential store of value that can appreciate over time, preserving purchasing power. Balance Sheet Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset class like crypto can diversify a company’s holdings beyond traditional cash, bonds, and stocks. Alignment with Future Technologies: For companies operating in or adjacent to the tech sector, holding crypto can align their balance sheet with the decentralized future they might be building or interacting with. Attracting Talent and Investors: For some, having crypto reserves can signal forward-thinking leadership and potentially appeal to employees and investors interested in the digital asset space. This trend of companies accumulating crypto reserves provides a new avenue for investors like Pantera Capital to gain exposure to the digital asset market indirectly. Exploring Pantera Capital’s Investment Choices Pantera Capital, in a note to its investors, highlighted specific companies they have invested in due to their strategic decision to hold cryptocurrencies. This provides concrete examples of their strategy in action. According to reports, these include: Twenty One Capital: Described as a cryptocurrency venture company with a focus on Bitcoin investments. Investing here provides Pantera exposure to a company whose core business revolves around the leading cryptocurrency. DeFi Development: This entity has reportedly adopted Solana (SOL) as a strategic reserve asset. This investment gives Pantera exposure not just to a specific altcoin, but to a company actively involved in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, utilizing SOL within that ecosystem. SharpLink Gaming: This company has chosen to hold Ethereum (ETH) as a reserve asset. Investing in SharpLink Gaming offers Pantera exposure to a company in the gaming sector that sees value in holding the second-largest cryptocurrency, likely recognizing its importance in areas like NFTs and decentralized applications. These examples showcase Pantera’s diversified approach, targeting companies holding different key cryptocurrencies, reflecting varying strategic decisions by those companies. Is This a Smarter Institutional Investment Strategy? Pantera Capital articulated a clear rationale for investing in these companies rather than just buying the underlying cryptocurrencies directly. They believe this approach can offer greater upside potential . But why might that be the case? Investing in a public company holding crypto reserves means you are not just betting on the price movement of the crypto asset itself. You are also investing in the company’s core business, its growth prospects, management, and operational efficiency. If the company is successful in its primary business while also benefiting from the appreciation of its crypto holdings, the investment’s return could potentially outperform a simple direct investment in the crypto asset alone. Consider a scenario where a company uses its crypto reserves strategically, perhaps leveraging them for financing, integrating them into services, or simply benefiting from their balance sheet value while its main operations generate significant profit. The value derived from the successful core business combined with the crypto appreciation could provide a compounding effect not available through direct crypto ownership. Furthermore, investing in publicly listed companies often comes with layers of regulation, reporting requirements, and corporate governance that might appeal to large institutional investment firms seeking structures they are familiar with. What are the Potential Benefits of This Approach? For an investor like Pantera Capital, and potentially for other institutional investment firms considering similar strategies, the benefits can be numerous: Indirect Exposure with Structure: Gaining exposure to crypto price movements through regulated, publicly traded entities. Potential for Compounded Returns: Upside from both the underlying crypto asset’s performance and the company’s business growth. Access to Specific Sectors: Investing in companies allows targeted exposure to sectors like gaming, DeFi, or venture capital that are actively using or focused on specific cryptocurrencies. Familiar Investment Vehicle: Public stocks are a traditional asset class, making this strategy potentially easier to integrate into existing portfolios and risk management frameworks compared to direct crypto holdings. Regulatory Clarity (Relative): While crypto regulation is evolving, investing in a regulated public company provides a degree of familiarity and existing legal frameworks. This method provides a nuanced way to participate in the crypto market’s growth, blending traditional equity investment with digital asset exposure. Are There Downsides or Challenges? No investment strategy is without its risks. Investing in companies with crypto reserves introduces unique challenges: Double-Edged Sword of Volatility: The company’s stock price can be affected by both the volatility of its core business and the extreme volatility of its crypto holdings. Company-Specific Risk: You are exposed to the operational risks, management decisions, and financial health of the specific company, independent of the crypto market. Valuation Complexity: Valuing a company with significant, volatile crypto assets on its balance sheet can be more complex than valuing a traditional company or simply valuing the crypto asset itself. Correlation Risk: In market downturns, both the company’s stock and its crypto reserves might fall in tandem, amplifying losses. Tax and Accounting Issues: How companies manage and report their crypto reserves can introduce accounting complexities that might impact their financial statements. Investors must carefully evaluate both the company’s fundamentals and the potential impact of its crypto holdings. How Does This Differ from Direct Crypto Investment? Directly buying Bitcoin , Ethereum , or Solana means you own the asset itself. Your investment performance is directly tied to the price fluctuations of that specific cryptocurrency. Investing in a company with crypto reserves adds a layer of indirection. With direct crypto, you manage your own wallets, keys, and security. With company stock, you rely on the company’s management to handle the custody and strategic use of the crypto assets. Direct crypto offers pure exposure to the asset’s price. Investing in a company offers exposure to the asset’s price *plus* the performance of the company’s business. For large institutional investment firms, the infrastructure, regulatory environment, and reporting requirements around public equities are often more established than those for direct crypto holdings, making the company-based approach potentially more accessible or preferable for certain mandates. What Does This Mean for the Future of Institutional Investment ? Pantera Capital’s strategy is indicative of a broader trend: institutional capital is finding increasingly sophisticated ways to enter the crypto market. While direct investment in Bitcoin ETFs and other funds is growing, strategies involving equity in crypto-exposed companies offer alternative risk/reward profiles. As more companies adopt crypto reserves, either as a treasury strategy or because their business involves digital assets, the universe of investable public companies with significant crypto exposure will likely grow. This provides traditional investors and crypto-focused funds like Pantera more options beyond simply buying crypto directly. This evolution suggests that the lines between traditional finance and the crypto world will continue to blur, creating new hybrid investment opportunities and strategies for sophisticated investors. Conclusion: A Strategic Evolution in Crypto Exposure Pantera Capital’s investment in publicly listed companies holding crypto reserves represents a notable strategic move in the institutional investment landscape. By targeting entities like Twenty One Capital, DeFi Development, and SharpLink Gaming, which hold assets like Bitcoin , Solana, and Ethereum , Pantera aims to capture potentially greater upside than direct crypto investment alone. This approach leverages the growth potential of both the underlying digital assets and the companies’ core businesses. While this strategy introduces unique complexities and risks compared to direct crypto ownership, it offers a structured, potentially more familiar pathway for large investors to gain exposure to the burgeoning digital asset class. It underscores the maturing of the crypto market and the innovative ways institutional capital is finding to participate in its future.

Meanwhile, US-listed spot Ethereum ETFs recorded net inflows for the ninth consecutive day, with a total of $91.93 million entering these funds on Thursday. Market Movements Bitcoin was traded at $106,204, down 1.38% in the last 24 hours. Ethereum fell 3.3% to $2,639. According to experts, these outflows may be due to profit taking, cautious approach to price fluctuations and short-term correction expectation. Spot ETFs continue to be monitored as an important indicator of institutional investor interest. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: US Spot Bitcoin ETFs End 10-Day Inflow Streak!

Analyzing the Shift in Investor Behavior appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Andre Dragosch, Head of Research at Bitwise in Europe, has pointed out that Bitcoin’s 60-day correlation with US 10-Year Treasury Futures has fallen to its lowest level ever. This historical decoupling could signal a growing shift in investor behaviour, possibly indicating increased interest in Bitcoin over traditional bonds. Curious? Dive in! Bitcoin’s Correlation with US 10-Year Treasury Futures Explained Correlation shows how two assets move in relation to each other. A higher correlation means they move together, while a low or negative correlation implies they move in opposite directions. ATTENTION: This is probably the most important macro chart for #bitcoin right now. Bitcoin's 60-day correlation to US 10yr Treasury Futures has declined to the lowest level ON RECORD. Are traditional investors selling US Treasuries to buy bitcoin? pic.twitter.com/QKR8YgcyPP — André Dragosch, PhD (@Andre_Dragosch) May 29, 2025 Highlighting a chart titled “Rolling Correlation: 10-Year UST Futures”, Dragosch has revealed that the 60-day correlation between Bitcoin and the US 10-Year Treasury Futures has plummeted to its lowest level ever recorded. The revelation has triggered a serious discussion on ‘are traditional investors selling US Treasuries to buy Bitcoin?’ US 10-Year Treasury Yield: A Simple Analysis At the start of April, the US 10-Year Bond Yield was 4.213%. Though at a point on April 4, it slipped as low as 3.859%, between April 7 and 11, it climbed steeply by 15.44%. On April 11, it hit the month’s peak of 4.590%. After hitting the peak, the market witnessed two minor corrections that month: a 4.48% correction b/w April 14 and 16 and a 4.34% correction b/w April 24 and 29. In the early half of this month, the US 10-Year Bond Yield saw a steady rise. Between May 1 and 21, it surged by 9.99%. At one point on May 22, it reached a peak of 4.629%. Currently, the yield sits at 4.420% – at least 4.49% below the peak of the month. Bitcoin Price Action: An Overview At the beginning of April, the Bitcoin price was $82,497.20. Although between April 1 and 8, the price dropped by 10.27%, between April 9 and 30, it almost steadily grew by 23.34%. In the early half of this month, the Bitcoin market also witnessed a steep increase. Between May 1 and 22 alone, the market jumped by 18.63%, from $94,123.24 to a peak of $11,653.95. Since May 23, the market has dropped by over 5.16%. A Final Note During May, both US 10-Year Treasury Yield and Bitcoin price saw significant increases, indicating a risk-on environment where both traditional safe assets and riskier assets were bought. However, Bitcoin’s initial April drop while yields also fluctuated, then its subsequent strong recovery coinciding with rising yields, hints at some capital rotation into Bitcoin as bond attractiveness waned. The subsequent minor corrections in both assets at the end of April and May suggest some profit-taking or shifting market sentiment. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-29T13:30:00.000Z,"How African innovators are using blockchain to solve real problems","While blockchain headlines in the West often focus on speculation and regulation, in Africa, it’s a different story, one rooted in necessity, innovation and grassroots adoption. The latest episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast explores this ground-up revolution with Kevin Imani, head of StarkWare’s Africa Venture Studio, who shares how communities across the continent are using blockchain to tackle real-world problems in finance, energy and connectivity.A student movement“Young students were using blockchain before it was mainstream,” Imani explained. From Kenya to Nigeria, local needs, not hype, drove early adoption. In many cases, it was students receiving digital currencies from abroad or freelancers getting paid in dollars and struggling to convert funds into local currency. With limited banking infrastructure or trust in government institutions, decentralized alternatives offered a lifeline.Imani highlighted how centralized systems like Kenya’s E-Mpesa changed access to finance, but still fall short for international payments or off-ramping digital assets. Related: Blockchain.com expands in Africa as local crypto rules take shape“You have to start becoming a trader almost,” he said, describing the convoluted process of converting stablecoins or crypto earnings into usable local funds. This trust gap has fueled peer-to-peer crypto usage. “These were kids holding stablecoins not to spend them, but to store value.” Even before regulators or startups built formal infrastructure, communities had already found use cases for blockchain.Blockchain beyond finance Beyond finance, African innovators are tapping blockchain to address energy insecurity. In rural Zambia, excess power from a mini hydro station could go to waste. Instead, residents can now use that surplus to mine Bitcoin, for example, generating revenue and creating a sustainable power loop. “It’s self-sustaining and reduces waste,” Imani said.Connectivity is another frontier. In areas where traditional internet providers fall short, decentralized WiFi hotspot networks are emerging. With blockchain, community members can share bandwidth and be compensated instantly and transparently. “You don’t need a middleman. It’s fair and trackable,” he said.Still, mainstream adoption remains cautious. Governments like those in Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa are in “standby mode,” focused more on consumer protection than full-scale implementation. But Imani remains optimistic: “The need is there. The technology is here. The only question is how we bridge that gap.”To hear the full conversation on The Clear Crypto Podcast, listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

2025-05-29T13:23:06.000Z,"Tim Berners-Lee says internet DNS should have been more decentralized","World Wide Web and hypertext markup language (HTML) inventor Tim Berners-Lee said that if he were building a domain name service (DNS) today, he would make it “more decentralized.”Speaking at ETH Prague on stage alongside Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, Berners-Lee reflected on early internet architecture decisions.“If I could go back […] I would make it more decentralized,“ he said.DNS was invented in 1983 by Paul Mockapetris, replacing the previous hosts.txt file-based system with a scalable, distributed system for naming IP addresses. Still, while Berners-Lee was not personally responsible for DNS development, he could have opted for a URL structure not tied to the DNS we know today, or he could have pushed for a decentralized alternative. Source: Mely.ethRelated: Decentralized naming could bring ‘next billion’ users to BitcoinCentralization of the DNSThe DNS system is highly centralized, particularly at its top levels of hierarchy. The root zone, which governs top-level domains such as .com and .org, is managed by the US-based nonprofit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).Furthermore, the most authoritative servers are operated by a handful of organizations, further centralizing the system. This allows for easy censorship and control by governments that can unilaterally seize or block domain names.This degree of centralization also makes outages due to centralized service disruption more likely. Control over root zones and domain policies is also concentrated in a few regions and among a select group of stakeholders.There are also concerns regarding privacy because centralized DNS queries can be monitored, logged and intercepted by internet service providers and other intermediaries.Related: Community split on ENS petition against Unstoppable Domains patentCrypto’s solution to the problemDecentralized alternatives to the DNS system are being developed. The most well-known is the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), which maps human-readable names to Ethereum addresses, content on the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS), or other data.Another alternative is Unstoppable Domains. Its system mints domains as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Ethereum and Polygon.ENS has seen a fair share of adoption. In late 2024, ENS Labs also partnered with PayPal and Venmo, sparking speculation about how this partnership is likely to boost mainstream adoption.IPFS runs on Ethereum smart contracts and aims to be user-owned and censorship-resistant. Currently, it is primarily used in Web3 applications, wallets and decentralized websites.Another alternative is Handshake (HNS), which aims to be a decentralized and permissionless naming protocol that is compatible with traditional DNS. A project with a similar aim is Namecoin (NMC), an early Bitcoin fork designed specifically to offer .bit domains and store DNS records onchain with censorship resistance.IPFS is also accompanied by its own Inter-Planetary Name System (IPNS), which enables mutable naming for IPFS addresses (hashes). URLs generated this way point to specific content, not servers.A non-crypto alternative to DNS is OpenNIC. This is a user-run project that offers non-ICANN domains, aiming to decentralize control through community governance.Magazine: Move to Portugal to become a crypto digital nomad — Everybody else is",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/tim-berners-lee-says-dns-should-have-been-more-decentralized?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

In a May 29 X post, Aave founder Stani Kulechov said the foundation borrowed $2 million in GHO tokens. “The EF is not only supplying ETH to Aave, but also borrowing from Aave,” Kulechov wrote, describing the development as “the full DeFi circle.”GHO is a decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin native to the Aave Protocol. Unlike centralized stablecoins, GHO is governed by Aave’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which oversees interest rates, collateral requirements and facilitator selection. The move highlights the EF’s growing engagement with the DeFi ecosystem, moving toward more sophisticated treasury strategies. The foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Source: Stani KulechovEthereum Foundation previously deployed $120 million in DeFiThe foundation’s move to borrow GHO follows a previous $120 million deployment into various protocols, signaling a shift in how it manages its crypto holdings. In February, the EF deployed 45,000 Ether (ETH) across different DeFi protocols, including Aave, Spark and Compound. At the time, the Ether was worth $120 million. Kulechov previously described the fund deployment as the foundation’s “biggest allocation in DeFi.” Because of the move, the Aave founder said that DeFi will win, expressing optimism as the EF added liquidity to the protocol.Apart from Kulechov, community members also celebrated the move, supporting the EF’s ETH holdings management shift. A community member said the development was a win, saying the foundation should “keep it up,” while an X user said it would be positive if the EF continued to use their funds this way. Related: Ethereum Foundation unveils security initiative to supplant legacy systemsCriticisms of the foundation selling Ether In January, Ethereum community members called on the foundation to explore alternatives to selling ETH for operational funding. The community suggested DeFi tools like staking and borrowing stablecoins against ETH. Eric Conner, co-author of EIP-1559, criticized the ETH selling, saying that the foundation’s primary use case seemed to be dumping its holdings. He called the practice “insane,” urging the EF to stake or use DeFi instead of selling. Anthony Sassano, host of The Daily Gwei, proposed that the EF stake part of its ETH and sell the staking rewards.

Mainstream browsers will also integrate agentic capabilities or build interoperability with purpose-built agentic browsers as AI becomes cheaper, according to Zhu.However, the most significant adoption will come within the next decade when onchain and offchain environments will be completely merged for internet users, Zhu said, adding:“Agentic browsers are poised to become the default entry point — much like smartphones replaced feature phones.”In the long term, Donut aims to support payments, gaming, content creation and social interaction, all within a single crypto-native browser. The company also plans to leverage advancements in decentralized identity and confidential computing to turn the browser into a personal “crypto CFO” for retail users.

2025-05-29T11:27:41.000Z,"Solana signals 40% crash vs. Ethereum amid cooling memecoin craze","Key takeaways: SOL/ETH has broken below a rising wedge pattern, signaling a potential 40% decline.Solana’s memecoin revenue has collapsed since April, weakening its core value proposition.Standard Chartered warns Solana may underperform as Ethereum’s L2 ecosystem grows more competitive.Solana’s (SOL) multiyear outperformance against Ethereum’s native token, Ether (ETH), is losing momentum, with technical breakdowns and weakening onchain activity pointing to a potential sharp decline in the SOL/ETH pair next.SOL enters rising wedge breakdown stageAs of May 29, the SOL/ETH pair has confirmed a breakdown from its multimonth rising wedge pattern, a bearish structure that often precedes significant declines.In technical terms, a rising wedge breakdown typically results in a drop equal to the pattern’s maximum height. SOL/ETH weekly price chart. Source: TradingViewFor SOL/ETH, this projects a downside target for July, near 0.038 ETH, representing a 40% decline from current levels.The 50-week exponential moving average (50-week EMA; the red wave) around 0.0628 ETH is offering interim support. A decisive weekly close below this level would likely confirm the bearish continuation toward the 0.038 ETH target.A bounce, on the other hand, could have SOL reclaim the wedge’s lower trendline as support, which may delay the breakdown scenario. Breaking above the wedge’s upper trendline will likely invalidate the 40% crash setup altogether.Cooling memecoin frenzy hints at SOL/ETH crashThe breakdown in SOL/ETH aligns with a visible decline in memecoin-driven activity on Solana. A key indicator is Pump.fun, the largest memecoin launch platform on the network, which shows a sharp drop in daily fee revenue since early April. Daily fees peaked in Q1 2025 but have since fallen to near-yearly lows, signaling reduced speculative activity on the chain, according to Dune Analytics.Pump.Fun fee and revenue chart. Source: Dune AnalyticsThe platform had been a major contributor to Solana's revenue growth, especially between December 2024 and March 2025. During this period, total cumulative fees surged past 3 million SOL as retail traders flooded the network to launch and trade meme tokens. These metrics have crashed ever since, weakening one of Solana's primary value drivers.A May 27 report from Standard Chartered further reinforces the downside narrative. The bank warned that Solana may underperform if it cannot diversify beyond memecoins, which currently dominate its transaction activity. Solana's decentralized exchange volume.

The retail CBDC pilot is being conducted with select customers and merchants through participating banks, while the wholesale pilot is targeting use in the interbank market.Per the report, the retail pilot has reached 600,000 users across 17 banks. To further scale adoption, the RBI has allowed “certain non-banks [...] to offer CBDC wallets.”The wholesale pilot has also seen increased institutional interest.

New features include “Magic Nodes,” which uncover hidden wallet connections among tokenholders, and “Time Travel,” a tool that reconstructs the historical distribution of tokens, potentially detecting early insider activity or coordinated accumulation efforts.“Historical data in crypto is notoriously hard to access because it gets buried under endless new transactions,” Bubblemaps CEO Nicolas Vaiman told Cointelegraph.“Time Travel changes that. It’s like watching a Big Bang, from the initial burst of a single bubble to a full-grown distribution,” he said.Source: BubblemapsThe tool allows users to rewind the token’s entire life cycle and evolving distribution structure, which will help them spot “early signs of manipulation or coordinated dumps,” Vaiman added.Related: Sui validators vote on $162M Cetus recovery plan to restore user fundsSpotting tokens with a large portion of the supply concentrated across a few wallets can help investors detect scams such as rug pulls, where insiders remove liquidity or stage a mass sell-off, resulting in a steep price collapse that leaves investors with worthless tokens.A large-scale rug pull hit the crypto industry on March 16 after the sudden collapse of the Wolf of Wall Street-inspired WOLF token, created by Hayden Davis, the co-creator of the Official Melania Meme (MELANIA) and the Libra token.Source: BubblemapsThe memecoin saw a 99% crash, wiping out most of its peak $42 million market capitalization within a few hours.

Instead, they receive a liquid token that can be traded or used in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.  DeFi Dev expects the adoption of this technology to “enhance the company’s validator operations and treasury management, consistent with its mission to maximize SOL Per Share” growth. Chief investment officer and chief operating officer Parker White said:The adoption of dfdvSOL not only creates additional ways to drive stake to our validators and increase SOL holdings, but also advances our role as a long-term participant in the Solana ecosystem.”Related: Solana may be a memecoin ‘one-trick pony’ — Standard CharteredSol Strategies prepares to safeguard capitalSol Strategies also announced on May 28 that it had completed several key audits and certifications. The company passed SOC 2 Type 1 and SOC 1 Type 1 audits and received ISO 27001 certification for its Solana staking platform.  SOC 2 Type 1 is a report assessing a company’s controls related to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality or privacy at a specific point in time. Such an audit verifies that the firm’s controls meet trust service criteria at the time of the check.SOC 1 Type 1 is a similar report focused on internal controls over financial reporting at a specific point in time. This audit evaluates whether the controls are appropriately designed, but does not assess their effectiveness over time.Lastly, ISO 27001 is an international standard specifying requirements for an information security management system. These standards help manage risks pertaining to data confidentiality, integrity and availability through a continuous improvement framework.To obtain this ISO certificate, a company must demonstrate both the documentation and implementation of controls. Sol Strategies’ Wald explained that all these measures are meant to ensure institutional trust:“By achieving SOC 2 Type 1 and SOC 1 Type 1, alongside our ISO 27001 certification, we’ve demonstrated that institutional clients can trust SOL Strategies with their Solana staking needs.”The compliance efforts come as the firm continues to position itself as a major Solana validator.
