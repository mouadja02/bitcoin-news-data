Detective Drove Victim to Kidnap Site, Reports Claim According to reports , both detectives in question were working as off-duty security for the alleged crypto criminal, though whether they received prior approval from the department is unknown. New: The NYPD stripped 2 detectives of their guns /badges & placed them on desk duty after the dept. learned they'd had been working security for William Duplessie & John Woeltz, the crypto investors recently arrested for allegedly kidnapping a man & torturing him. @CBSNewYork pic.twitter.com/BBsS9uVR2U — Tim McNicholas (@TimMcNicholas) May 29, 2025 One of the detectives, a veteran with nearly 20 years of experience, reportedly drove the Italian crypto kidnapping victim from the airport to the luxury SoHo apartment where he was eventually held captive. “Every city employee is expected to follow the law, including our officers, both on and off duty,” the mayor’s office said in a statement. “We are disturbed by these allegations, and as soon as it came to our attention, the officers were placed on modified duty.” Two Arrested in Shock Crypto Kidnapping News of the scandal comes just one week after the unidentified Italian businessman escaped the weeks-long crypto crime ordeal that saw him shocked, tortured and held at gunpoint. Crypto businessmen John Woeltz and William Duplessie allegedly lured the victim to New York City on May 6 after threatening to kill his family in a bid to gain access to his Bitcoin . The hostage escaped barefoot when Duplessie and Woeltz turned their backs on him shortly after he revealed his Bitcoin password. Reports indicate that the anonymous victim may have been a business partner of Duplessie and Woeltz, although this has not been confirmed. The family of Woeltz told The New York Post on Monday that the multimillionaire may have been “manipulated” into the crime himself. “He’s a kind, caring, loving person, so he was completely controlled by other people,” Woeltz’s relative told the media outlet.

2025-05-30T17:20:23.000Z,"How to Do Cloud Mining in 2025: HashFly Review & Beginner’s Guide to Bitcoin Mining","Discover how to mine Bitcoin in 2025 with HashFly, the world’s leading cloud mining platform. Learn how to get started, earn daily crypto rewards, and explore flexible, eco-friendly mining contracts. Cloud mining has emerged as a compelling alternative for individuals seeking to profit from digital assets like Bitcoin without the complexities associated with traditional mining or trading. Platforms such as HashFly are at the forefront, offering accessible and potentially lucrative avenues for both novices and seasoned investors.​ The Appeal of Cloud Mining Cloud mining involves renting computing power from remote data centers to mine cryptocurrencies. This model eliminates the need for personal mining equipment, thereby reducing concerns related to hardware costs, maintenance, and energy consumption. In 2025, cloud mining has become particularly appealing due to several factors:​ Lower Upfront Costs: Traditional mining requires significant investment in hardware and infrastructure. Cloud mining allows users to participate without these substantial initial expenses. ​ Operational Efficiency: By outsourcing the technical aspects of mining to specialized providers, individuals can avoid the complexities of hardware setup and maintenance. ​ Accessibility: Cloud mining opens the door for those who may lack the technical expertise or resources to engage in traditional mining, democratizing access to cryptocurrency profits. ​ Regular Passive Income: Participants can earn a consistent stream of cryptocurrency rewards, providing a potential source of passive income. ​ Positive Outlook for the Cryptocurrency Market The cryptocurrency market in 2025 is experiencing transformative growth, bolstered by increased institutional adoption and regulatory clarity. Analysts predict that Bitcoin could reach between $190,000 and $210,000 by the end of the year, driven by its finite supply and rising institutional demand. Additionally, the global market for cryptocurrency trends is projected to grow from $2.1 billion in 2024 to $5 billion by 2030, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.4%. ​ Cloud Mining vs. Traditional Trading While traditional cryptocurrency trading involves buying and selling digital assets to capitalize on price fluctuations, it requires a deep understanding of market dynamics and can be highly volatile. Cloud mining offers a more stable and predictable alternative:​ Predictable Returns: Cloud mining contracts often provide fixed returns, offering a level of predictability not typically found in trading. ​ Reduced Risk Exposure: By participating in mining, individuals can earn cryptocurrency rewards without being directly exposed to market volatility. ​ Diversification: Engaging in cloud mining allows investors to diversify their cryptocurrency portfolio, balancing the risks associated with trading. Comparing Cloud Mining to Other Crypto Income Models In the broader context of earning through crypto, cloud mining offers an attractive alternative to other models like staking, yield farming, or day trading. Each method has its own risk-reward dynamics: Staking requires locking up assets for a period of time and is generally limited to proof-of-stake (PoS) cryptocurrencies. While it’s relatively low-risk, the returns can be modest compared to cloud mining. Yield Farming, largely driven by decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, is highly volatile and often exposed to smart contract risks, rug pulls, and impermanent loss. Day Trading, while potentially lucrative, demands constant monitoring, technical expertise, and a high tolerance for market volatility. Cloud mining , by contrast, provides a more passive and predictable income stream, especially for those who want exposure to the crypto economy without devoting full-time effort or technical know-how. And with platforms like HashFlyoffering contracts starting as low as $50, it also opens the door for low-risk experimentation. ​ HashFly: Leading the Way in Cloud Mining Founded in 2013, HashFly has established itself as a prominent player in the cloud mining industry, offering services for major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Litecoin (LTC). Trusted by more than 1 million users across the globe, HashFly prioritizes user accessibility, advanced security, and green energy solutions.​ Key Features and Offerings User-Friendly Interface: Designed for both beginners and experienced miners, HashFly's platform simplifies the mining process, allowing users to monitor contracts, track earnings, and adjust settings effortlessly.​ Advanced Mining Technology: The company employs state-of-the-art mining hardware and optimized algorithms to ensure efficient and competitive mining operations.

2025-05-30T17:19:08.000Z,"European Central Bank Warns Banks Against Rushing Into Crypto","As traditional banks in Europe become more involved with cryptocurrencies, the European Central Bank (ECB) is growing concerned. On May 30, ECB policymaker and Governor of the Bank of Italy, Fabio Panetta, gave a severe warning. He said that banks working closely with crypto companies could risk customer trust, which, if lost, could cause the whole financial system to suffer. ECB Warns Crypto Losses Could Damage Trust in Banks Panetta shared his thoughts during the Bank of Italy’s annual report presentation. He explained that many people do not fully understand the risk associated with crypto assets. If banks start offering these assets, customers might believe they are as safe as regular savings or investment products. However, they are not. Digital currencies are risky and not protected in the same way as normal bank services. He explained that the concern is about individual losses and trust. If enough people lose confidence in banks because of crypto losses, it could harm the entire credit system. Panetta’s view on crypto aligns with that of Swiss National Bank (SNB) President Martin Schlegel. Schlegel said the bank will not hold Bitcoin as a reserve in April. He explained that Bitcoin’s well-known price swings made it unsuitable for the bank’s needs . Schlegel stated that stability is critical for any asset worthy of national reserve inclusion. Banks Are Moving Ahead With Crypto Plans Even with these warnings, some banks are already making moves in the crypto space. Earlier this year, Intesa Sanpaolo, one of Italy’s largest banks, bought €1 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC). The bank’s CEO, Carlo Messina, called this acquisition a “test.” On the other hand, it is also part of a larger plan. The bank now has its digital asset trading desk and handles crypto trades. In Spain, Santander is also preparing to enter the crypto market . According to reports, the bank is considering creating its stablecoin and offering crypto services through its digital app. Reportedly, top banks like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo are working together to launch a joint stablecoin project . These steps show that major banks are becoming more active in crypto. This is happening quickly, and some experts believe that regulations are not keeping up. ECB Calls for Caution It is important to note that Fabio Panetta is not against change. However, he believes that banks and regulators need to be more careful. He highlighted that the main problem is trust. Banks are seen as safe and reliable. If people lose money through crypto services offered by banks, that trust could break. He emphasized that rebuilding may be difficult to rebuild once it is broken.

While the US is leading in Bitcoin accumulation and hashrate distribution, the UAE is starting to develop into a rather big player in the global Bitcoin ecosystem, especially in the Middle East. Officially, the US holds the most Bitcoin with more than 207k in its fold, but some reports suggest that the UAE holds approximately 420k Bitcoin, valued at around $46 billion. However, there are no official sources to support the claim, as this is more of a rumor that’s been spreading around.

From Trump’s meme coin dinner to the SEC’s stunning reversal on Binance, a new era in crypto regulation may be dawning—and not without controversy. Trump’s Meme Coin Dinner Sparks Transparency Backlash On May 25, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson dodged pointed questions about a private meme coin dinner hosted by President Donald Trump at his Virginia golf club earlier in the week. Speaker Mike Johnson sidestepped transparency questions on Trump’s meme coin dinner, as Democrats call for a DOJ probe. #trump #memecoin https://t.co/IST3Gu2foM — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 26, 2025 The event, reportedly attended by top investors in the Trump-themed “TRUMP” meme coin, has raised red flags among Democrats, 35 of whom have called on the Department of Justice to investigate possible corruption and foreign influence. In a CNN interview, Johnson claimed ignorance of the May 22 event and refused to comment on whether the guest list should be released. With crypto now playing a visible role in campaign fundraising and narrative-building, critics argue that unchecked intersections between politics and digital assets pose serious ethical questions. Banking Lobby Pushes Back Against SEC Cyber Rule While political tensions flared, financial institutions were busy behind the scenes. On May 22, U.S. banking heavyweights—including the American Bankers Association, Bank Policy Institute, and SIFMA—petitioned the SEC to withdraw its controversial cybersecurity incident disclosure rule. The regulation, known as Item 1.05 in Form 8-K, mandates disclosure of material cyber incidents within four business days. However, industry groups warn that this requirement endangers national security, disrupts law enforcement efforts, and causes unnecessary panic. Their message: transparency shouldn’t come at the cost of an effective cybersecurity response. David Sacks Floats ‘Budget-Neutral’ Bitcoin Reserve Strategy In a more surprising development, David Sacks—a key White House adviser on crypto and artificial intelligence—proposed that the U.S. could begin acquiring Bitcoin without increasing the national debt. White House’s David Sacks Hints at Budget-Neutral Path for U.S. Bitcoin Purchases through asset reallocation rather than new spending. #Bitcoin #Bitcoin2025 https://t.co/xX9g1PBwWs — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 28, 2025 Speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas on May 27, Sacks hinted that Treasury assets could be reallocated to build a strategic Bitcoin reserve, suggesting a shift toward digital gold without new government spending. This “budget-neutral” strategy could become a foundational talking point if the next administration, potentially Trump-led, leans further into Bitcoin as a geopolitical hedge. Trump Media Bets $2.5 Billion on Bitcoin Treasury Strategy In tandem with the government’s speculative interest in Bitcoin, Trump Media & Technology Group is taking decisive action. The company behind Truth Social announced a private placement offering worth $2.5 billion to amass what could become one of the largest corporate Bitcoin treasuries in history. The funding, split between $1.5 billion in common stock and $1 billion in convertible notes, is expected to close by May 29. With the president’s brand directly tied to both political and crypto narratives, this move solidifies Trump’s role as an emerging Bitcoin maximalist, at least in the public eye. Departing CFTC Commissioner Warns of ‘Big Swings’ in Oversight Even as crypto gains institutional favor, regulatory instability looms. Christy Romero, outgoing commissioner of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), issued a cautionary note during her farewell remarks at the Brookings Institution. As she exits the CFTC, Christy Romero issues a warning: “big swings” in regulatory policies could crack the foundation of U.S. markets. #ChristyRomero #CFTC https://t.co/w1aSAb44E5 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 27, 2025 Romero warned that “big swings” between aggressive regulation and hands-off deregulation could jeopardize the integrity of U.S. financial markets. While she didn’t name names, the remarks are widely seen as a critique of the Trump administration’s shifting stance on digital assets and market oversight. Department of Labor Reverses 401(k) Crypto Ban Another reversal this week came from the U.S. Department of Labor. On May 28, it rescinded its 2022 guidance that discouraged cryptocurrency in workplace retirement plans. The prior policy had warned plan sponsors to exercise “extreme care” and triggered investigations into firms offering crypto options. U.S. Department of Labor Reverses Crypto Guidance, Opens Door for 401(k) Bitcoin Exposure, ending Biden-era restrictions. #Crypto #401k https://t.co/9Pw4USYtwS — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 28, 2025 Now, the reversal indicates a more neutral stance on crypto regulation, opening the door for Bitcoin to return as a viable 401(k) asset—a potentially transformative development for crypto adoption among retail investors. SEC Ends Lawsuit Against Binance, CZ In perhaps the week’s most jaw-dropping twist, the SEC dropped its high-profile lawsuit against Binance and its former CEO Changpeng Zhao. The case, filed in June 2023, accused the exchange of inflating volumes and mishandling customer funds. @SECGov and @binance legal clash ends as U.S. regulator drops landmark lawsuit. #binance #SEC https://t.co/Qlz11yoG4n — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 30, 2025 On May 29, both parties jointly signed a dismissal, bringing an end to a two-year saga that had cast a shadow over the global exchange. The sudden conclusion leaves observers wondering: Is the crypto industry’s biggest regulatory battle truly over or just entering a new phase? This week revealed a U.S. crypto sector at an inflection point. While Trump allies promote digital assets through political events and billion-dollar treasuries, regulators are struggling to keep pace—and often stepping back.

This move comes as Santander’s Spanish competitor, BBVA SA, announced in March its intention to offer cryptocurrency services following approval from Spain’s regulatory authority, the CNMV. BBVA has already been providing similar services in Switzerland and Turkey, allowing customers to buy, sell, and manage transactions in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) through their app. How BBVA Aims To Guide Customers In Crypto Assets Gonzalo Rodríguez, BBVA’s head of retail banking in Spain, emphasized the bank’s commitment to making cryptocurrency investment accessible, stating, “Our goal is to guide them as they explore this new segment of digital assets, backed by the solvency and security assurances provided by a bank like BBVA.” The MiCA regulation aims to harmonize the currently fragmented regulatory landscape across the European Union’s (EU) 27 member states. By establishing a comprehensive framework, the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets is shaping how major digital market participants operate within one of the world’s largest economic regions. The regulation allows banks, investment firms, and other financial institutions to engage in cryptocurrency activities, provided they have the necessary authorization under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) II. Such a move comes in the wake of growing legislative support in the US led by President Donald Trump, who has increasingly changed its previous vision about digital assets and Bitcoin with major announcements, including the establishment of a Strategic Crypto Reserve. As such, Bitcoin reached a new record high of $111,800 last week, with analysts and investors vowing to see even greater gains in the coming months. Consequently, the total crypto market capitalization reached a new high of $3.5 trillion last week, now standing at $3.3 trillion as investors flock to cash out their gains.

2025-05-30T17:00:36.000Z,"Analyst: Cardano To $10 In 2025? These 5 Catalysts Could Ignite ADA","Cardano staking pool operator (SPO) Sssebi (@Av_Sebastian) has ignited a debate by asserting that Cardano’s ADA could reach double-digit territory this year. In a thread that began, “These are the ingredients for $10 $ADA in 2025,” he listed five developments he believes will transform the eighth-largest cryptocurrency from a $0.70 token into a $10 asset. Each of those “ingredients” is now taking shape—and each comes with its own uncertainties. #1 Cardano Becomes Bitcoin’s DeFi Layer At the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Input Output (IO) stunned attendees by moving a live Bitcoin Ordinal across a new BitVM-based bridge to Cardano. IO called the demonstration “a preview of what is to come,” adding that the “Cardinal” protocol aims for full integration so BTC holders can lend, borrow and stake inside Cardano’s extended-UTxO environment. By transplanting Bitcoin liquidity onto a programmable ledger without wrapped custodial tokens, Cardano positions itself as a settlement layer for so-called BTCFi applications—an addressable market that today tops $1 trillion in dormant value. Related Reading: Cardano: Elliot Wave Predicts 50% Crash For ADA Price, Is It Time To Get Out #2 The Midnight “Glacier Drop” Airdrop Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson told Consensus 2025 in Toronto that Midnight, his privacy-focused sidechain, will airdrop both NIGHT governance tokens and DUST privacy tokens to “approximately 37 million wallets across eight major blockchains”—with “zero allocation to venture capitalists.” “Every Consensus there’s a new token saying, ‘my thing is better,’” he said. “We’re going to give this away and let users decide.” The sheer scale dwarfs recent airdrops and could seed tens of millions of new ADA-capable addresses once Midnight’s cross-chain fee model pushes traffic back to the base chain. #3 A US Listed Cardano Spot ETF In February NYSE Arca filed to convert the Grayscale Cardano Trust into a spot ETF. The Securities and Exchange Commission acknowledged the application on 24 February, starting a 240-day clock that now runs to 22 October 2025. The agency’s first-phase deadline of 29 May was pushed to 15 July, following the pattern that preceded January’s Bitcoin ETF approvals. Grayscale has argued that ADA’s on-chain transparency and staking mechanics make it “substantially resistant to manipulation,” echoing the language that ultimately persuaded regulators on Bitcoin. An approval would give traditional investors a regulated conduit to stake-enabled yield—something no US crypto ETF yet offers. Related Reading: Cardano Whale Activity Spikes – 80 Million ADA Added In 48 Hours #4 ADA In The US Strategic Reserve President Donald Trump’s March executive order created a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a US Digital Asset Stockpile to hold crypto seized in federal cases. A subsequent Truth Social post surprised markets by naming “XRP, Solana and Cardano” for inclusion alongside Bitcoin and Ether; ADA jumped more than 70% intraday. Though the order bars fresh purchases of altcoins, Treasury accounting shows roughly $493 million in non-Bitcoin assets—ADA among them—already earmarked. Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov called the move “a reputational boost, signaling the US. views digital assets as strategic.” Inclusion in a sovereign reserve legitimises ADA for conservative allocators and could ease the path for futures and options listings. #5 The Ouroboros Leios Upgrade Hoskinson labels Leios “the capstone of the entire Ouroboros agenda … the fastest cryptocurrency on the planet.” In a May 1 livestream he said simulations show “tens of thousands of transactions per second” without sacrificing decentralization. The upgrade introduces parallel input, ranking and endorsement blocks, allowing throughput to be dialed up as adoption demands. If main-net integration lands in H2 2025, Leios would coincide with Midnight’s launch and the ETF review window—an alignment bulls see as catalytic. ADA trades near $0.70 today, implying a market capitalization of roughly $25 billion. A jump to $10 would push valuation toward $350 billion, rivaling Ethereum’s 2024 peak.

2025-05-30T16:55:51.000Z,"US Authorities Sanction Philippines-Based Firm for Allegedly Providing Computer Infrastructure for Crypto Pig Butchering Scams","The U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is taking action against a Philippines-based company accused of facilitating a popular crypto investment scam. In a statement, the Treasury Department says that Funnull Technology Inc. is facing US sanctions for allegedly providing computer infrastructure to hundreds of thousands of websites engaged in pig butchering scams. Perpetrators of pig butchering scams use fake identities to build online relationships with unsuspecting individuals with the aim of introducing them to fraudulent cryptocurrency investment opportunities. Criminal organizations based in Southeast Asia largely carry out the scheme by exploiting victims of human trafficking. Funnull purportedly buys IP addresses from major cloud services companies and sells these to cybercriminals to host scam platforms and malicious websites. The company also provides services that make it easier for bad actors to impersonate trusted brands and allow them to quickly change to a different domain name and IP address when the legitimate providers attempt to take the websites down. In 2014, Funnull bought and altered a repository of codes used by web developers to redirect visitors of legitimate sites to scam and online gambling sites, some of which are associated with Chinese criminal money laundering operations. The Treasury Department says that Funnull has ties to the majority of the crypto investment scam websites that were reported to the FBI. US-based victims claim losing over $200 million to these schemes, or an average of $150,000 per individual. The OFAC is also imposing sanctions against Funnull’s administrator, Chinese national Liu Lizhi, who was in possession of documents that contain information about the company’s employees, including their performance and progress on tasks.

Wynn announced he is back with another 40X long on BTC. James Wynn is back with another leveraged position on Hyperliquid, just hours after closing all previous long positions and absorbing the losses. Wynn renewed his attempt to break into a $1B earnings from leveraged trading, a stunt that would boost both his personal profile and the influence of Hyperliquid. The new risky position fluctuated between temporary loss and gain, once again attracting the attention of BTC traders for counter-positions or attempts at liquidation. | Source: Hyperliquid After high-stakes trading, which was seen as a deliberate attempt to liquidate Wynn’s position, he initially gave signs of capitulating. Wynn round-tripped his initial 40X leveraged position, up to $82M in unrealized profit and down to $100M loss. Wynn’s moves are extremely risky, but he has made multiple previous attempts at trading. Currently, Wynn’s positions spark counter-trading, as well as potential attempts to sway the price of BTC and liquidate the position. Just these for now Hoping BTC pulls lower but i don’t see it pic.twitter.com/wd9751v27t — James Wynn 🐳 (@JamesWynnReal) May 30, 2025 Wynn’s positions aim to make up the loss in one trade and depend on a dramatic move by BTC. Currently, the open positions on BTC and kPEPE are in the green, with a liquidation price of $102,630 for BTC. James Wynn took the new position as BTC traded around $105,581, preparing for the monthly close. BTC is up 11.66% for the month to date, performing similarly to May 2024 with 11.06% gains. However, last-minute shifts may threaten Wynn’s positions and lead to partial closing or an outright liquidation. The crypto community is either rooting for Wynn to perform his feat of winning the perpetual DEX casino or to see his position liquidated. Despite the outcome, Wynn has turned into a factor for BTC sentiment. Wynn’s position added to the $6.9B in open interest on Hyperliquid, which became the 13th largest derivative exchange. The risky trades keep boosting the exposure for the perpetual DEX, which aims for a top spot next to some of the largest centralized markets. James Wynn continues building a reputation of reckless trading Wynn continued building his reputation as the most reckless trader, once again with the potential to sway the BTC market. Wynn’s position appeared at a time when BTC was still choosing direction, with most traders showing a bullish sentiment. The new liquidation price raises the matter of another ‘whale hunt’ and attempts to crash BTC to the liquidation position. Despite this, Wynn is again not shy about his public position, which is immediately advertised on social media. Wynn’s actions themselves are becoming a sentiment signal for the crypto market. The risky trades aim to match the overall sentiment and are sometimes extremely successful. At other times, Wynn has allowed the positions to be liquidated or has deliberately closed them. Wynn switches to meme tokens Following the $100M loss, Wynn did not skip a beat, but continued to shill his latest meme token, MoonPig. Within hours, MOONPIG tripled its price from $0.01 to $0.03. The Moonpig token only promoted itself with an idle game, awarding tokens to its leaderboard. However, Wynn’s effect on the price is another testament to the trader’s influence. Wynn has minimal meme token holdings on Hyperliquid, recently also showing interest in PURR, FARM, VAPOR, and BUDDY. The trader’s moves helped boost HYPE, the native token of Hyperliquid. HYPE recovered to $32.62, still close to its all-time high above $39. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

2025-05-30T16:37:25.000Z,"Bitcoin (BTC) Profit-Taking Still Modest, No Sign of Bull Run Ending","With Bitcoin trading below $106,000, some participants are opting to cash out partial holdings, looking to lock in profits amid the crypto asset’s impressive price performance in the past month or so. While this raises concerns of early signs of a trend reversal, new data revealed the sustainability of the rally. NRPL Signals Continued Optimism According to CryptoQuant’s latest analysis , the Net Realized Profit/Loss (NRPL) metric shows that while BTC investors are realizing some profits following the recent price surge, the scale of these sales remains modest compared to past market peaks. The current level suggests a possible short-term correction, but not one strong enough to reverse the broader bullish trend. In contrast to the significant NRPL spikes seen during previous cycle tops in March and November 2024, the present level of profit-taking is relatively low. This indicates that most investors are still holding rather than selling in large numbers. Based on this analysis, there is little evidence to suggest the upward cycle is ending. The current market behavior points to continued strength in Bitcoin’s rally, with no clear signs of a transition into a downtrend. Whale Buys and BCMI Jump Support Accumulation Thesis Accumulation trends among certain major Bitcoin holders are becoming increasingly evident. For instance, addresses holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC, excluding exchanges and miners, are increasing , indicating large holder accumulation. This trend reflects growing investor confidence, which has historically been associated with rising Bitcoin prices. In fact, in the last 48 hours alone, whales have bought over 20,000 BTC, according to an update shared by crypto analyst Ali Martinez. Additionally, CryptoQuant’s BCMI has climbed sharply, with the 7-day SMA reaching 0.6 by May 29th – an early signal of potential market upside. The 90-day SMA remains at 0.45, which is indicative of a stable and non-overheated environment. This composite index includes metrics like MVRV, NUPL, SOPR, and sentiment indicators to assess cycle positioning. With profit realization slowing and stronger on-chain signals emerging, the market may be entering the early stages of an accumulation phase.

2025-05-30T16:15:22.000Z,"Crypto-Assets and Financial Stability: The Bank of Italy’s Call for Caution","The Bank of Italy on Friday sounded a clear warning about the deepening ties between crypto-assets and the traditional financial system, warning of the risks crypto could pose to financial stability. Governor Fabio Panetta stressed the urgent need for a coordinated and comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets, especially as they become increasingly integrated into mainstream finance. A Risky Integration with Traditional Finance Governor Panetta noted the growing number of agreements between crypto firms and financial intermediaries. A growing number of large, publicly traded U.S. firms now park substantial Bitcoin holdings on their balance sheets, putting everyday investors on the hook for the coin’s sharp price swings. At the same time, the boom in Bitcoin exchange-traded funds has woven crypto even more tightly into traditional markets. Panetta cautioned that this overlap comes with serious dangers. Unlike standard financial assets, most cryptocurrencies—including Bitcoin—have no underlying value and can swing wildly in price. Since they are typically traded on lightly regulated, opaque platforms, these assets could set off shocks that reverberate through the wider financial system. Stablecoins and Systemic Threats Panetta also focused on the emergence of stablecoins—digital assets designed to maintain value relative to fiat currencies or other assets. While they seek to offer price stability, their utility as a payment instrument remains questionable in the absence of robust regulation. Risks related to issuer reliability and the underlying collateral persist, raising concerns for consumers and regulators alike. The Governor warned that if major global tech companies were to adopt stablecoins for payments across their platforms, they could create powerful, systemically important networks beyond the reach of national regulators. These shifts could erode governments’ control over their own currencies, put people’s data at risk, and upend core banking services such as lending. Panetta also warned that the anonymity built into many crypto-assets makes them attractive for bad actors, who could use them to launder money, trade illegally, or dodge international sanctions. MiCA: Strengthening Rules for Safer Crypto Markets Governor Panetta noted the importance of regulatory progress in Europe, pointing to the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) as a step toward a safer and more transparent digital asset market. He noted that MiCA introduces clearer rules designed to protect consumers and ensure the orderly development of crypto markets. The regulation distinguishes between different types of stablecoins, granting payment legitimacy only to those backed by a single official currency, referred to as electronic money tokens (EMTs). According to Panetta, only these EMTs offer sufficient safeguards to qualify as a reliable means of payment under the new framework. Italy’s Central Bank Engages Crypto Firms Italy’s central bank and securities regulator have been in active discussions with crypto service providers to ensure robust financial and cybersecurity safeguards.

2025-05-30T15:50:15.000Z,"Unstoppable Bitcoin Rally: Why Profit Taking Signals Continued Growth","BitcoinWorld Unstoppable Bitcoin Rally: Why Profit Taking Signals Continued Growth Is the recent uptick in profit taking by long-term Bitcoin holders a sign that the current Bitcoin rally is running out of steam? For many observers, seeing large amounts of Bitcoin move after significant price increases triggers alarm bells, conjuring fears of a market top. However, according to insights from leading crypto analytics firm Santiment, this particular instance of profit taking might be a fundamentally different signal – one that actually supports the continuation of the bullish trend in the crypto market . Understanding Holder Behavior in the Crypto Market In any market, understanding the actions of participants is crucial. In the volatile crypto market , deciphering holder behavior can offer unique insights into potential future price movements. Santiment, known for its on-chain data analysis, points to a specific metric that sheds light on what long-term holders are doing: the Mean Dollar Invested Age (MDIA). What exactly is MDIA? It’s a metric that calculates the average age of all Bitcoin on the network, weighted by the price at which each coin last moved. Think of it as tracking how long, on average, investors have held onto their Bitcoin without selling or moving it. When MDIA increases, it suggests that coins are sitting idle in wallets, indicating accumulation or HODLing behavior. When MDIA decreases, it means older coins are being moved, typically signifying selling or spending by those who acquired Bitcoin some time ago. Santiment’s recent data shows a notable decline in Bitcoin’s MDIA since roughly mid-April. This decline is the key indicator of increased coin circulation, driven by holders who have been in the market for a while – the ones now engaging in profit taking . Why Profit Taking Might Fuel the Bitcoin Rally Traditionally, a decrease in MDIA due to selling might be seen as bearish. However, Santiment argues that a falling MDIA during an ongoing bull market is historically a strong bullish indicator. This seems counter-intuitive at first glance, but here’s the logic: When long-term holders, who bought Bitcoin at much lower prices, start selling, they are essentially taking profits. This action does several things that can sustain a Bitcoin rally : Provides Liquidity: Their selling provides the necessary supply for new buyers entering the market or existing holders wanting to increase their position. This prevents the rally from stalling due to a lack of available coins at current prices. Redistributes Supply: Bitcoin moves from ‘old hands’ to ‘new hands’. If the new buyers are accumulating with a long-term perspective, this fresh capital and renewed conviction can add momentum. Prevents Overheating (Initially): Unlike speculative short-term traders who might panic sell at the first sign of trouble, long-term holders selling into strength can create healthy pullbacks or consolidations, preventing the market from becoming excessively parabolic and prone to a sharp crash. It’s a more controlled distribution. Confirms Price Levels: The fact that there is sufficient demand to absorb the selling pressure from profitable holders validates the current Bitcoin price levels and builds a stronger foundation for further increases. Santiment emphasizes that this type of circulation, where older coins move, is characteristic of healthy bull markets where value is being transferred and new capital is entering. It’s distinct from a scenario where short-term holders are rapidly trading back and forth, which can indicate frothiness and potential tops. Is This Holder Behavior Different This Time? Every market cycle has unique characteristics, but the underlying principles of holder behavior often rhyme. The current decline in MDIA suggests that the long-term conviction that defined the earlier stages of accumulation is now transitioning into strategic distribution by those who have held for years. This is a natural phase in a bull market. Consider the alternative: if MDIA continued to rise indefinitely during a rally, it would mean virtually no one is selling. While this might sound bullish (extreme HODLing), it would actually make the market illiquid, leading to extremely volatile price spikes followed by potential crashes when the inevitable selling eventually occurs from fewer, larger holders. The current pattern, according to Santiment’s analysis, suggests a more sustainable, albeit potentially choppy, ascent for the Bitcoin price . Key Takeaways and Actionable Insights For those navigating the crypto market , understanding metrics like MDIA and the implications of profit taking by different types of holders is invaluable. Here are some actionable insights: Look Beyond Simple Price Action: Don’t just react to price dips or large sell orders. Investigate the underlying on-chain data. Monitor MDIA: A falling MDIA during a bull trend is often a positive sign, indicating healthy market activity rather than capitulation. Distinguish Holder Types: Recognize that selling by long-term holders can have a different market impact than selling by short-term speculators. Stay Informed: Follow analyses from reputable firms like Santiment to get deeper insights into market dynamics beyond basic charts. While no single metric guarantees future performance, the MDIA provides a powerful lens through which to view the current Bitcoin rally . It suggests that the recent increase in coin movement isn’t a red flag waving goodbye to the bull market, but potentially the necessary fuel to keep the engine running. Conclusion: Why Profit Taking May Sustain the Rally In conclusion, the recent trend of profit taking observed among Bitcoin holders, as indicated by the declining Mean Dollar Invested Age (MDIA), appears to be a constructive development for the ongoing Bitcoin rally . Rather than signaling an impending top, this movement of older coins into circulation provides essential liquidity, facilitates redistribution to new market participants, and helps create a more stable foundation for the rising Bitcoin price within the broader crypto market .

2025-05-30T15:48:06.000Z,"HOT MOMENTS: Donald Trump Accuses China of Violating the Tariff Agreement – White House Releases a Statement","US President Donald Trump has slammed Beijing, saying that China has “completely violated” the tariff agreement it made with the US. “Maybe it’s not surprising to some, but China has completely violated the agreement it made with us,” Trump said. White House official Miller also supported Trump's statements. Miller said, “We have a wide range of options to hold China accountable,” and indicated that the US could take new steps against Beijing. Miller also said that they would not allow China to take away US production capacity and that espionage activities carried out through student visas would be stopped. Related News: And the Deal is Done: Trump's Company Announces Bitcoin Move Arguing that China has not fulfilled its commitments with the US, Miller said, “China must demonstrate its commitment to the rules-based international order.” Miller conveyed that President Trump hopes that China will choose the path of “cooperation and common ground.” The Chinese Embassy in Washington responded to these statements by the US. The embassy spokesperson said, “China calls on the US to end discriminatory restrictions and jointly protect the consensus reached at the high-level talks in Geneva.” China and the United States continue to maintain contacts on various occasions at the bilateral and multilateral levels in the economic and trade fields, and both sides have expressed their concerns, the spokesman said. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-30T15:45:42.000Z,"Reform UK Embraces Bitcoin as Farage Outlines Sweeping Crypto Agenda","Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has announced that his party will begin accepting political donations in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, marking a first for a British political party. The move comes alongside promises of sweeping crypto legislation if his party comes to power. Crypto Donations Go Live Speaking at the Bitcoin Conference in Las Vegas, where he was introduced as a “UK presidential candidate,” Farage confirmed that Reform UK is now able to accept cryptocurrency donations from eligible UK donors. The party’s website was updated on Thursday evening to facilitate the new payment option. Farage declared, “As of now, provided you are an eligible UK donor… we are the first political party in Britain that can accept donations in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.” A Reform UK spokesperson later confirmed that additional details about the initiative would be released on Friday. Legislative Vision for a ‘Crypto Powerhouse’ Farage outlined a broader crypto policy agenda, stating that his party intends to introduce a cryptoassets and digital finance bill. Central to this would be a proposal to slash capital gains tax on crypto assets from the current 24% to 10%. In addition to tax reforms, the proposed legislation would prohibit banks from debanking customers solely for interacting with digital assets. Farage also reaffirmed his opposition to a British central bank digital currency (CBDC), distancing Reform UK from the idea of a state-issued digital pound. A notable aspect of the party’s crypto platform includes establishing a Bitcoin reserve within the Bank of England. Farage described this measure as part of his vision to transform the UK into a major global crypto hub. Context and Industry Response Farage’s announcement arrives amid ongoing debates within UK financial circles about how best to regulate digital assets. Just weeks earlier, Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves had unveiled draft legislation aimed at regulating cryptocurrency firms under frameworks similar to traditional financial institutions. Meanwhile, MPs on the Treasury Select Committee have controversially called for crypto assets to be regulated as gambling products, warning of the high risk of investor losses. The UK Treasury, however, rejected this recommendation, stating it did not support applying gambling laws to cryptocurrency. Longstanding Crypto Advocacy Farage’s stance on digital assets is not new. He has advocated for cryptocurrencies since 2020, when he highlighted the vulnerabilities of fiat currencies and described Bitcoin as the best “anti-lockdown investment” during the pandemic. At the Las Vegas event, he praised the US approach to digital assets as “nothing short of fantastic” and expressed ambitions to position London as one of the world’s leading crypto trading centres. With the next UK general election slated for 2029, Reform UK’s pro-crypto platform and its acceptance of Bitcoin donations position it as a distinctive voice in the country’s evolving digital finance landscape.

2025-05-30T15:37:28.000Z,"20,000 BTC Purchased in Just 2 Days by Whales: How Will Bitcoin’s Price React?","TL;DR BTC whales have returned in full force, accumulating more than $2 billion worth of the cryptocurrency in a short timeframe. The rising exchange outflows and other essential factors are also bullish factors, suggesting that the asset’s price may head north soon. Whales Filled Their Bags The renowned analyst Ali Martinez unveiled on X that large investors scooped up more than 20,000 BTC in the past two days alone. Whales have bought over 20,000 #Bitcoin $BTC in the last 48 hours! pic.twitter.com/cCmQOpUV8X — Ali (@ali_charts) May 29, 2025 According to Martinez’s chart, the collective bitcoin holdings of this investor cohort are just north of 4.7 million assets, which represents around 23.7% of the circulating supply. Accumulation from whales is generally viewed as a bullish factor that may be a precursor of a price rally. It shows that such investors have increased their confidence in the asset, which could encourage smaller players to join the bandwagon as well . Numerous X users reacted to the post, with some assuming that Michael Saylor could be among the individuals contributing to the buying spree. The company he co-founded has become the world’s largest corporate holder of bitcoin, while he personally owns over 17,000 BTC, as he confirmed last year. Additional Bullish Elements The aforementioned actions of the whales are not the only factor suggesting that the price of BTC could be on the verge of a rally. Over the past month, the supply of the asset on exchanges has dried up. Ali Martinez revealed that 30,000 BTC had been moved off centralized platforms within the timeframe, while the chart below shows that the exchange netflows were positive in only seven out of the last 30 days. BTC Exchange Netflow, Source: CryptoQuant This suggests a shift from these entities toward self-custody solutions, which reduces the immediate selling pressure. Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) should also be taken into account . The momentum oscillator measures the speed and magnitude of recent price changes and varies from 0 to 100. When the ratio drops below 30, it typically indicates that the asset may be oversold and could be poised for a resurgence. Conversely, anything above 70 is interpreted as a bearish element. Over the past several hours, the RSI has been on a downward trend , currently standing just north of the lower mark.

The Wall Street bank estimated that spot bitcoin ETFs saw $358 million of redemptions yesterday, according to a Friday report, with just one, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) attracting a net inflow. IBIT gathered in a net $125 million, the bank observed. In contrast, Fidelity’s FBTC saw net outflows of $166 million, leading the redemptions, the report said. Other major contributors included the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) -$107 million, ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) -$89 million and the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) -$71 million, the bank said JPMorgan said smaller outflows were also noted across the remaining issuers. The bitcoin price slipped 1.1% on the day, but market activity remained robust with trading volumes of $5.39 billion, well above the 20-day average of $2.81 billion, the report added.

2025-05-30T15:35:30.000Z,"Revolut eyes the US for expansion","Mazen ElJundi, Head of Crypto at Revolut, confirmed that the crypto-friendly digital bank is reintroducing its cryptocurrency services for users in the United States. The relaunch signals Revolut’s strategic intent to deepen its presence in the rapidly evolving decentralized finance (DeFi) space, reflecting broader momentum toward integrated financial ecosystems. The announcement also aligns with the firm’s wider strategy to connect traditional finance with Web3 by building strategic industry partnerships and developing product offerings. Revolut eyes US for expansion After announcing plans to revive its US cryptocurrency services , Revolut is expected to reintroduce Bitcoin and Ethereum tokens previously available on the platform. However, the official list of supported assets has yet to be confirmed. The move underscores the British fintech firm’s commitment to capitalizing on the growing demand for crypto and blockchain-based payment solutions in the US. Revolut also announced its partnership with Pyth Network . ElJundi commented on the company’s announcements revealing the role of reliable market data for advances in the DeFi space. ElJundi said their collaboration with Pyth marks a key moment in Revolut’s mission to update the world of finance. He further stated that as decentralized finance becomes more popular, Pyth’s role as a core part of the industry will enable the bank to take advantage of this change. Martin Mignot, a partner at the European venture capital firm Index Ventures and an early investor in Revolut, emphasized that one can not truly be the top player if they are not number one in the US. He referred to the US as the biggest consumer market globally. Moreover, Siddhartha Jajodia, the CEO of Revolut in the US, states that the country is essential for its goal to become a “global bank.” This made their mission clearer: to connect with millions more customers targeting the US. Analysts speculate Revolut’s arrival in the US could spur more competition for crypto offerings. This strategic move may attract regulatory attention and technological progress to achieve a significant share of the retail investment sector. Revolut previously launched its cryptocurrency services in the EU and UK Previous expansions by Revolut in regions including the EU and UK have led to incremental user growth, though they have not directly impacted major asset prices. Revolut, the biggest digital bank in the UK, stormed onto the UK scene a decade ago. Its easy-to-use mobile apps and lower fees for services such as overseas transactions and cross-border transfers have won millions of customers. The proportion of UK adults using neobanks soared from 16% in 2018 to 50% last year, according to data providers from reliable sources. Revolut is a neobank, which means it is a digital bank that provides different banking and financial services mainly through its mobile app, without the need for regular physical branches. It stands out as one of the leading neobanks, competing with other companies like Wise, N26, and Nubank. The fintech firm wants to increase this user percentage further, focusing on the larger US market with $24tn of assets. This is because the US market has several elements that may be attractive to its users. For example, interchange fees—the charges imposed by card networks like Visa and Mastercard on behalf of banks—are significantly higher in the US than in the EU or UK, where such fees are capped. As a result, a US customer generates more profit for the same volume of payments. The US is also super competitive in retail banking, where over 3,000 institutions offer attractive customer rewards and loyalty deals. Some critics say that European fintechs may not offer enough yet to attract customers away from their existing banks.

Bitcoin ETFs Emerge As Preferred Safe Haven According to a Bloomberg report, US Bitcoin ETFs have attracted over $9 billion in inflows in the past five weeks, primarily driven by BlackRock Inc.’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT). In contrast, gold-backed funds have seen outflows exceeding $2.8 billion during the same time frame. Related Reading: Can XRP Market Cap Touch $1.5 Trillion? Analyst Reveals The Math Behind It This divergence in investor behavior comes as easing trade tensions have diminished demand for traditional safe havens like gold. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is increasingly being recognized as a viable alternative store of value amid growing concerns about US fiscal stability. Furthermore, the market’s leading cryptocurrency reached a record high of $111,980, buoyed by favorable regulatory developments and rising macroeconomic uncertainty. Although gold remains up more than 25% this year, it has retreated from its recent peaks, currently trading approximately $190 below its all-time high. BTC’s Advantages Over Gold Analysts suggest that this rotation towards Bitcoin ETFs indicates a growing acceptance of the cryptocurrency as a legitimate hedge within investment portfolios. Christopher Wood, global equity strategist at Jefferies, expressed optimism for both gold and Bitcoin, noting their effectiveness as hedges against currency debasement in the G7 nations. However, skeptics argue that Bitcoin’s notorious volatility still undermines its position as a true safe haven. Historical instances of macroeconomic shocks have shown Bitcoin falling sharply alongside other risk assets. Yet, some experts believe that Bitcoin’s decentralized nature gives it an advantage over gold in times of financial system risks. Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, highlighted Bitcoin’s dual role as a hedge against both private sector risks, such as the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023, and government-related concerns, including the stability of the US Treasury. Kendrick pointed out that recent threats to Federal Reserve (Fed) independence, alongside tariff escalations and broader concerns about US policy credibility, further bolster Bitcoin’s appeal. Related Reading: $400K Bitcoin? Analyst Says It’s Not A Dream—It’s ‘Coded’ In addition to these factors, Bitcoin appears to be shedding its previous reputation as merely a tech-adjacent risk asset. Dilin Wu, a research strategist at Pepperstone, noted that Bitcoin’s intraday correlation with major indices like the Nasdaq, as well as with the dollar and gold, has significantly decreased. The backdrop of growing fiscal strain has intensified the discourse surrounding these assets. Moody’s recently downgraded the US from its last triple-A credit rating, citing concerns over ballooning deficits and national debt. This downgrade aligns the US with other ratings agencies, including Fitch and S&P Global, which already rate the country below the top tier. Despite the recent surge in Bitcoin’s popularity, gold continues to outperform on a year-to-date basis, boasting gains of about 25% compared to Bitcoin’s rise of approximately 15%.

2025-05-30T15:30:25.000Z,"Highlights from the Bitcoin 2025 Conference in Las Vegas","From May 27th to 29th, 2025, Las Vegas became the epicenter of the global Bitcoin community as Bitcoin 2025 convened, marking a pivotal moment for the industry. Bitcoiners, digital asset-aligned politicians, and leading Bitcoin companies converged to forge connections and strategise as increasing regulatory acceptance and integration into traditional finance has already begun to reshape the landscape. The atmosphere buzzed with optimism as participants explored the growing momentum of Bitcoin’s adoption, solidifying its position as a significant force within the rapidly evolving global financial system. The Most Important Announcements to Emerge from Bitcoin 2025 The Bitcoin 2025 conference represents a cornerstone gathering for the global Bitcoin community, uniting individuals from diverse backgrounds, including developers, miners, and institutions, to champion the vision of sound money and financial freedom through collaboration, innovation, and a shared belief in the enduring potential of Bitcoin as a decentralised and resilient monetary network. Let’s take a look at some of the most exciting news to be announced at this year’s event. US Vice President JD Vance Gives a Powerful Pro-Bitcoin Speech During his address at the Bitcoin 2025 conference, Vice President JD Vance articulated a significant shift in the US government’s approach to digital assets, framing Bitcoin’s growth not just as a technological innovation, but as a reflection of a broader, decentralised movement. He emphasised a deliberate alignment between the administration’s priorities and the values of the Bitcoin community, asserting a commitment to fostering its expansion and resisting what he characterised as undue bureaucratic interference. Vance laid out a strategic vision for the future, focusing on promoting widespread adoption amongst American citizens and advocating for a regulatory framework designed to support Bitcoin’s integration into the national economy. He accentuated the importance of empowering the community itself, arguing that Bitcoin’s continued success hinged on active participation and a direct dialogue between the people and their government, suggesting a departure from previous administrations’ approaches to the sector. Don Trump Jr. and Rumble CEO Chris Pavlovski Announce Bitcoin Treasury Don Trump Jr. and Rumble CEO Chris Pavlovski articulated a strategic alignment with the current administration’s approach to digital assets, characterised by the establishment of a significant crypto treasury and a deliberate investment in Bitcoin’s potential. The pair emphasised the evolving political landscape, framing the administration’s support as a catalyst for a wider shift within the financial sector. Highlighting the formation of a substantial $2.5 billion crypto treasury and a series of strategic partnerships, including an alliance with the mining company Hut 8 , Trump Jr. and Pavlovski positioned Rumble as a key participant in a rapidly developing landscape. They underscored a belief that the administration’s pro-crypto stance represented a fundamental change, suggesting a broader adoption trend and a repositioning within the industry, referencing a shared vulnerability to regulatory scrutiny. US Senator Cynthia Lummis Discuss BTC Reserve & Stablecoin Legislation US Senator Cynthia Lummis outlined a strategic approach to regulating and integrating digital assets, emphasising the necessity of addressing market structure and stablecoin legislation to support evolving industry practices. She acknowledged the crucial role of supporting businesses involved in Bitcoin transactions, from custodial services to lending, and highlighted the need for a flexible regulatory framework capable of accommodating diverse applications. Senator Lummis emphasised the importance of establishing a streamlined tax system for smaller Bitcoin transactions and addressed the challenges presented by the US government’s historically cautious stance toward digital assets. She expressed a perspective where Bitcoin could serve as a critical strategic asset, not just for economic stability but also for bolstering national defence and mitigating potential geopolitical risks, particularly concerning global economic influence. Paolo Ardoino Announces That Tether Will Become World’s Biggest Bitcoin Mining Company During his presentation at Bitcoin 2025, Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether & CTO at Bitfinex , unveiled a significant strategic shift, asserting that the company would become the world’s largest Bitcoin mining operation. Ardoino detailed Tether’s Bitcoin holdings, exceeding 100,000 coins, alongside substantial reserves of US Treasury bonds totaling $120 billion. He underscored Tether’s origins as a Bitcoin-centric organisation, emphasising the company’s deep-rooted commitment to the cryptocurrency’s underlying principles. Ardoino highlighted a considerable investment, estimated at $2 billion, dedicated to energy production and Bitcoin mining activities, positioning Tether as a key player in decentralised infrastructure. Ardoino introduced a novel AI system, dubbed “QVAC,” designed with societal rather than corporate objectives in mind. Notably, he described QVAC’s operational structure: an AI agent possessing its own non-custodial wallet,and operating independently under pre-determined terms. Alongside this development, Tether announced a collaboration with Rumble to launch a dedicated Bitcoin wallet, alongside a supplementary stablecoin portfolio, signalling a broadening strategy to integrate Bitcoin into broader financial applications. Ark Labs Announces Arkade Native Bitcoin Execution Layer At Bitcoin 2025, Ark Labs unveiled Arkade, a novel application designed to introduce programmable capabilities directly onto the Bitcoin network, operating as a dedicated execution layer. Following a recent funding round, Arkade seeks to unlock new possibilities for financial applications while preserving the core security and decentralised nature of Bitcoin itself, eschewing the use of sidechains or alternative consensus mechanisms. Arkade functions by virtualising Bitcoin’s transaction layer, allowing developers to build sophisticated applications without requiring modifications to the underlying protocol. Early collaborations with established players like Tether, Boltz , Breez , and Mempool demonstrate the growing interest in this approach, which aims to transform Bitcoin from solely a store of value into a dynamically adaptable and universally accessible financial platform, a shift anticipated to represent a significant advancement within the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. Saylor Expresses Doubt About Proof of Reserves for Strategy Michael Saylor voiced strong opposition to publishing on-chain proof of reserves for Strategy , arguing that the practice inherently compromises the security of institutions employing this method. He presented a core concern: the increased vulnerability of custodians, exchanges, and investors due to the public disclosure of their Bitcoin holdings. Saylor’s resistance stemmed from two primary arguments. Firstly, he asserted that publishing wallet addresses creates an amplified attack vector, exposing institutions to heightened risks from hackers, hostile actors, and nation-state interference. Secondly, he emphasised that existing proof-of-reserves systems only demonstrate asset ownership without addressing potential liabilities, advocating instead for robust, legally-backed audits conducted by established, “Big Four” accounting firms to provide a more secure and verifiable assessment of financial health. NYC May Eric Adams Announces Bit-Bond New York City Mayor Eric Adams formally announced the city’s intention to issue a “Bit Bond,” a novel financial instrument designed specifically for Bitcoin holders. Framing this move as a deliberate step toward embracing innovation, Adams expressed a return to welcoming the cryptocurrency community, particularly those who had previously sought refuge outside of New York due to regulatory challenges. Adams’ announcement was characterised by a desire to reassert the city’s leadership within the digital asset space. He framed the Bit Bond as a tangible signal of New York’s commitment to fostering a supportive environment for Bitcoin, alongside plans to integrate blockchain technology into city services like record keeping and revenue collection, reflecting a broader strategy to engage and empower its residents within the digital economy. Adam Back Unveils Blockstream’s Plan to Boost Bitcoin Infrastructure Adam Back announced a strategic vision for Blockstream , based on scaling Bitcoin’s adoption to encompass a projected trillion-dollar market. He discussed the nascent stage of Bitcoin’s evolution, highlighting growing engagement from major players, from governmental figures to institutional leaders, and framed the company’s role as a foundational contributor to this expansion. Back detailed Blockstream’s planned infrastructural developments, focusing on simplifying the user experience for Bitcoin adoption and focusing on self-custody as a core component. The company’s roadmap included the creation of a unified platform integrating consumer-grade tools with enterprise solutions, alongside a strong commitment to robust security and a “Bitcoin-first” architectural approach, ultimately aiming to establish Bitcoin as the dominant foundation for global finance. Saifedean Ammous Comments on Tether and Bitcoin as a Reserve Asset Saifedean Ammous presented a compelling case for Bitcoin’s eventual dominance in the global financial system, arguing that the U.S. dollar’s decline was an inevitable consequence of its inflationary nature. He highlighted Tether’s role as a critical bridge in this transition, anticipating a scenario where Bitcoin reserves would significantly surpass U.S. dollar holdings. Ammous’ argument centered on a self-reinforcing cycle: increasing demand for Tether, driven by concerns over the devaluing dollar, would spur Tether to acquire more Bitcoin, which in turn would drive up the price of Bitcoin. He characterised this process as a “transition monetary system,” predicting a future where Bitcoin, rather than the dollar, would represent the primary store of value, a future he described as unstoppable. Human Rights Foundation Donates 8 BTC to Freedom Projects The Human Rights Foundation has announced a transformative investment of $80 million in Bitcoin, distributed through its Bitcoin Development Fund to 298 projects operating across 62 countries worldwide. This substantial grant program strategically targets the development of decentralized technologies and their application in regions grappling with economic instability, political repression, and limited access to traditional financial systems. The fund’s focus extends beyond simply providing capital, it’s designed to build resilient infrastructure encompassing open-source Bitcoin development, localised educational programs, and the creation of secure, self-custodial wallets, all with the ultimate goal of empowering individuals to circumvent censorship and safeguard their assets. This initiative directly addresses critical gaps in financial inclusion, particularly in underserved communities where traditional banking systems offer little recourse. Projects like “Bitcoin Boma” in Malawi, which teaches Bitcoin in local languages, and “Stringer News,” a censorship-resistant media platform, demonstrate a targeted approach to building financial freedom and promoting secure communication in regions facing economic and political restrictions. By fostering a network of decentralised solutions, the HRF’s Bitcoin Development Fund represents a powerful tool for safeguarding human rights and promoting a more equitable and resilient global financial landscape. Block Announces Lightning Network Payments Strategy At Bitcoin 2025, Block unveiled a strategic push to establish Bitcoin as a viable everyday currency, centered around expanding access through integrated payment solutions and bolstering the Lightning Network. Following the official launch of Bitcoin payments through Square POS, allowing merchants to accept Bitcoin directly in-store, Block simultaneously orchestrated a world-record Lightning event, showcasing the network’s scalability and speed. This initiative directly addresses the challenge of transitioning Bitcoin beyond its role as a store of value, prioritizing its utility within daily transactions. Block’s efforts extend beyond a single product launch. The company’s commitment to Bitcoin’s adoption is underscored by its operational infrastructure, including operating one of the world’s largest Lightning Network nodes and facilitating automated Bitcoin conversions for over 1,700 merchants. By actively integrating Bitcoin into its existing financial platforms, including Cash App, Block aims to reinforce Bitcoin’s legitimacy and accelerate its integration into the global financial system, effectively validating Bitcoin as a functioning currency. Sati Rolls Out Lightning Payments to Xverse Users At Bitcoin 2025, Sati announced the integration of the Lightning Network into its Xverse wallet, extending instant, borderless Bitcoin transactions to over 1.5 million users. This move leverages the Lightning Network’s capabilities, facilitating rapid, low-cost payments without requiring users to manage channels or switch between applications. By connecting Xverse to the Lightning Network, Sati aims to restore Bitcoin’s original design, as a peer-to-peer payment system, and directly addresses the growing demand for scalable, efficient digital transactions. Beyond simply enabling Lightning payments, Sati’s rollout is underpinned by supporting infrastructure, including the recently launched Parasite Pool mining pool. This pool, utilising Sati’s core technology, caters specifically to smaller-scale miners, offering a low-fee, instantly-paid system. The initiative reflects Sati’s strategy of providing comprehensive Lightning infrastructure solutions, attracting a broader user base and solidifying its role as a key facilitator of Lightning Network adoption.

After publicly declaring his exit from leverage trading earlier this month, on-chain data shows Wynn has now opened a fresh $50 million long position on Bitcoin ( BTC ), a striking reversal from his earlier stance, and one that puts him back in the line of fire. According to data tracked via Arkham and Hyperliquid , the new BTC position sits at 437 BTC with 40x leverage, valued at just over $46.1 million at an entry price of $105,560. The mark price at last check was hovering around $105,571, leaving the position nearly breakeven with a razor-thin unrealized profit of $2,086 — a +0.2% move, essentially noise at this scale. https://twitter.com/arkham/status/1928457983639396586 With a liquidation level of $102,849, even a modest 2.5% dip from current price action could wipe out the position entirely. Just these for now Hoping BTC pulls lower but i don’t see it pic.twitter.com/wd9751v27t — James Wynn 🐳 (@JamesWynnReal) May 30, 2025 James Wynn was only just liquidated for $100 million This aggressive bet follows Wynn’s prior catastrophic loss, where he was liquidated for over $100 million , one of the largest individual perp losses publicly recorded this year. The trader has been moving capital aggressively. Blockchain data shows multiple high-value inflows and outflows between Binance, Hyperliquid, and self-custodial wallets. In just the past 48 hours, over $8 million in USDC has been routed through Wynn’s wallets, with several tranches split between 500K and 2.7M USDC at a time, typical of positioning behavior for large directional bets. For context, Bitcoin is currently trading just above $105,500, down 3% in the past 24 hours and over 5% from recent local highs. Price action remains volatile, especially as funding rates reset and liquidity thins ahead of the weekend.

2025-05-30T15:16:46.000Z,"Why MSTY's High Yield Could Fly Even Higher As Strategy's Volatility Potentially Rebounds","Summary MSTY's 140% dividend yield remains sustainable and could rise further, driven by MSTR's unique volatility and leveraged Bitcoin exposure. Active management allows MSTY to generate strong premiums even as MSTR's volatility declines, supporting robust and growing monthly payouts. MSTY's structure (blending Treasuries, cash, and covered calls) mitigates downside risk and enhances yield potential in choppy or range-bound markets. Even with potential declines in volatility, MSTY is likely to provide huge yields, making it an incredible income vehicle. About four months ago, I covered the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA: MSTY ) for the first time, explaining why I believed that its 100% dividend yield was sustainable. My argument has played out well, with MSTY not only sustaining hefty payouts, but even raising them. Even in what has been a rather challenging period for Strategy ( MSTR ), including its shares experiencing a significant m/Nav compression in recent months, MSTY's yield farming strategy keeps going strong. In fact, the ETF has achieved a total return of 6.64% since my article on Jan. 25th, outperforming the S&P 500's total return of -0.8%, even with some NAV erosion on the way. Today, I aim to revisit the ETF's investment case, and explain why today's 140% dividend yield (on a TTM basis or 134% yield based on the latest payout's run rate), not only remains sustainable, but could even move higher, much like what happened since my previous article. The MSTY Magic: It's All About Harvesting Volatility Now, for those unfamiliar with the ETF, allow me to provide a quick overview of what it's all about. So, at its core, MSTY is an engine turning the chaos carried by MSTR stock into cash flow. MSTY doesn’t own MicroStrategy shares directly. Instead, it uses a synthetic covered call strategy, blending U.S. Treasury bills, cash, and short-term call options on MSTR to monetize the stock's underlying volatility. By selling out-of-the-money call options, like the ones you can see in the table below as per its latest holdings, MSTY collects hefty premiums, which it distributes as monthly dividends to investors. These payouts tend to be huge relative to the ETF's NAV previously due to the massive premiums in MSTR's options market. MSTY Holdings (Seeking Alpha) The reason this strategy performs so well with MSTR is that Strategy is no ordinary company. With over 568,000 Bitcoins on its balance sheet, it’s the largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency and a leveraged bet on Bitcoin’s price. With trades and investors from all backgrounds utilizing the stock and its underlying derivatives for different strategies (e.g., holding a levered regulated play on BTC, betting on moonshot call options, or selling the volatility to generate income), MSTR moves more than Bitcoin itself. This volatility fuels rich option premiums, and MSTY captures exactly that (on the selling of the volume front). Defying the Odds: Stronger Dividends Despite Declining Volatility Typically, you’d think a dip in MSTR’s volatility would spell trouble for MSTY’s payouts. After all, lower volatility should mean slimmer option premiums. But surprisingly, MSTY has bucked this trend. As you can see, MSTR's 30-day implied volatility has now declined to around 51%, a notable decline from its 2024 peak of over 150%. MSTR 1M Vol (Koyfin) Yet, MSTY’s dividends have held strong, even growing in recent months. How is this possible? MSTY Dividend History (Seeking Alpha) The answer lies in MSTY’s active management and overall flexibility. The fund doesn’t just blindly sell calls on 100% of its synthetic MSTR exposure. In fact, a few days ago, MSTY adjusted its strategy, writing calls on only about 75% of its holdings, leaving room to capture more upside during MSTR rallies. It also added out-of-the-money long calls at higher strike prices, like $455 and $475, to hedge against parabolic moves. This approach seems to allow MSTY to generate substantial premiums, even in calmer markets. But more importantly, even with the stock's volatility on the decline, MSTR’s option premiums remain very rich, particularly due to the levered nature of MSTR. For instance, YieldMax’s Bitcoin ETF-focused ( YBIT ) yields around 81%, significantly lower than MSTY’s 140%. The difference? MSTR’s unique position as a leveraged Bitcoin play keeps its options pricier and way more active overall. The 140% Yield: Sustainable and Poised to Grow Of course, sustainability is the big question with any high-yield investment, let alone one with such a crazy high yield. Can MSTY’s 140% yield hold up, or is it going to all come crashing down? As I said in my initial article, there is no reason to think that MSTR's high-premium options market is going to fade out any time soon, especially considering that MSTR has both accelerated its BTC accumulation trajectory and actively leveraged up its balance sheet through its two high-yield preferreds ( STRK )( STRF ). In fact, MSTY's yield could very well climb higher under the right conditions. At the end of the day, MSTY’s yield is driven by MSTR’s volatility (even if that hasn't prevented the fund from generating massive premiums, as I was just discussing). So if Bitcoin’s price swings become more violent (up or down), which is not unlikely after several weeks of tight consolidation, we could see premiums move even higher, and thus dividends move higher. In the meantime, even if volatility/premium/dividends were to all unwind, it's still likely that MSTY will be yielding 50%/60%/70%, which would obviously continue to make it a highly attractive investment. The premiums are so high that even a meaningful decline would still make MSTR one of the best yield-farming vehicles. Another engineering beauty is that MSTY’s share price stability enhances its yield potential. Unlike MSTR, which can plummet in a BTC bear market, MSTY’s structure mitigates some downside through its Treasury and cash holdings. If its share price holds steady while dividends grow, the effective yield rises. This dynamic makes MSTY appealing in choppy or range-bound markets, where option premiums shine without the full downside risk of owning MSTR outright. Take the past six months, for example, where you've had MSTY outperform MSTR notably during the latter's mNAV compression. MSTY/MSTR Returns (Koyfin) And yet, MSTY maintains the potential to outperform BTC over the long term, even if it does give some upside away against MSTR due to covered calls capping some of its gains during bigger common stock runs. MSTY/MSTR/BTC Returns (Koyfin) The Risk No investment is without risks, and MSTY is no exception. However, given the nature of the ETF, I believe that the only noteworthy risk is the possibility of a capped upside in a runaway MSTR bull market, as sold calls limit participation in sharp rallies, as I mentioned earlier. If Bitcoin soars to $200,000 and MSTR triples on a multiple expansion-driven enthusiasm, MSTY investors will miss out on some of those gains. Also, a prolonged Bitcoin bear market could slash MSTR’s volatility and stock price, shrinking option premiums and distributions. But still, I find it extremely unlikely that MSTR's volatility will drop to levels that don't produce at least a 30%, 40%, or 50% yield per year, as it will remain a levered BTC play that draws all types of investors who want to bet on each side of the equation that will keep premiums very high. This is the whole \""volatility is vitality\"" argument Mr. Saylor has been trying to explain since MSTR adopted a BTC treasury strategy, after all. Why MSTY Shines for the Bold Look, MSTY isn’t for everyone. You need to buy into the idea that MSTR’s volatility, driven by Saylor’s innovative capital-raising strategies, is a deliberate feature. Once you understand why MSTR is inherently volatile and an ideal playground for market speculators, it becomes clear that an ETF like MSTY, designed to harness this volatility, can deliver exceptionally high, sustainable yields. If that clicks, holding MSTY makes perfect sense.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4791225-why-msty-high-yield-could-fly-even-higher-as-strategy-volatility-potentially-rebounds?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","MSTR|STRK|STRF|MSTY",cryptocompare
2025-05-30T15:10:45.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Willy Woo Issues Critical Bearish Divergence Warning","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Prediction: Willy Woo Issues Critical Bearish Divergence Warning The cryptocurrency market is constantly buzzing with predictions and analysis, and sometimes, a specific timeframe can hold significant weight. According to well-known on-chain analyst Willy Woo, Bitcoin is currently navigating a critical window that could determine its near-term trajectory. His recent commentary has put traders and investors on high alert regarding the potential for a Bitcoin bearish divergence on a key technical chart. The Critical Window for Bitcoin Price Prediction Willy Woo, sharing his insights on X (formerly Twitter), highlighted a specific deadline looming for the flagship cryptocurrency. He stated that Bitcoin has a limited time frame – just two days and sixteen hours from his post – to stage a significant price rally. This isn’t an arbitrary deadline; it’s tied directly to the closing of the weekly price candle, a crucial point for technical analysis. Why is this timeframe so important? The weekly chart provides a higher-level perspective on market trends, often filtering out the noise seen on daily or hourly charts. Technical patterns that appear on the weekly scale are typically considered more significant and potentially indicative of longer-term moves. Woo’s analysis suggests that the current price action relative to other indicators (like momentum oscillators) is setting up a specific pattern that will finalize when the current weekly candle closes. Understanding Bitcoin Bearish Divergence Let’s break down what a bearish divergence means in technical analysis terms. A divergence occurs when the price of an asset moves in one direction, while a technical indicator (like the Relative Strength Index – RSI, or MACD) moves in the opposite direction. A Bitcoin bearish divergence specifically happens when the price makes a higher high, but the indicator makes a lower high. This often signals that the upward momentum is weakening, even though the price is still climbing, and it can be a precursor to a price reversal or a significant downturn. On a weekly chart, such a divergence is particularly noteworthy because it reflects weakening momentum over a longer period. If Bitcoin fails to rally convincingly before the weekly close, the pattern could be confirmed, potentially signaling a shift in market sentiment and price direction. Key points about bearish divergence: Occurs when price makes higher highs, but an indicator makes lower highs. Suggests weakening upward momentum. On a weekly chart, it’s considered a strong signal. Can precede a price correction or extended sideways movement. What Willy Woo Bitcoin Analysis Reveals According to Willy Woo Bitcoin analysis, the risk isn’t just a minor dip, but potentially a ‘prolonged period of sideways or dull market activity’. This suggests that a confirmed weekly bearish divergence might not immediately trigger a sharp crash, but rather lead to a frustrating period for bulls, characterized by: Limited price volatility. Range-bound trading within a relatively tight channel. Lack of strong directional moves. Reduced trading volume and general market apathy. This kind of market environment can be challenging for traders seeking quick profits and may test the patience of long-term holders hoping for a swift continuation of an uptrend. Woo’s warning implies that the current juncture is pivotal – either Bitcoin finds the strength for a breakout rally now, or it risks getting stuck in a less exciting phase. Navigating the Current Bitcoin Market Analysis For those following Bitcoin market analysis , this warning from a respected on-chain analyst provides a crucial data point. While technical analysis should never be the sole basis for investment decisions, understanding potential chart patterns like a bearish divergence is vital for managing risk and setting expectations. Actionable Insights: Watch the Weekly Close: Pay close attention to Bitcoin’s price action leading up to and at the weekly candle close (typically Sunday evening UTC). This is when the potential divergence pattern will either be confirmed or invalidated. Monitor Momentum Indicators: While Woo didn’t specify which indicator, keep an eye on common ones like RSI and MACD on the weekly chart to see if their movement aligns with the price or shows divergence. Consider Risk Management: If the divergence is confirmed, be prepared for the possibility of reduced volatility or downward pressure. This might involve adjusting trading strategies, setting stop-losses, or reducing position sizes. Look for Confirmation: A single technical signal is rarely definitive. Look for confluence with other indicators, on-chain data, or fundamental news before making significant moves. Challenges: Technical analysis is probabilistic, not guaranteed. Divergences can sometimes resolve without a major price move. Unexpected news or events can override technical patterns. The exact timing and magnitude of any subsequent move after a confirmed divergence are uncertain. Implications for the Crypto Market Outlook As Bitcoin often acts as the tide for the broader cryptocurrency space, a period of sideways or dull activity for BTC could have ripple effects across altcoins. The overall Crypto market outlook could become less bullish in the short-to-medium term if Bitcoin loses momentum and enters a consolidation phase following a confirmed weekly bearish divergence. Investors in altcoins should consider how their portfolios might perform in a less volatile or potentially downward-trending Bitcoin environment. Historically, altcoins can sometimes see independent rallies, but often they are highly correlated with Bitcoin’s price movements. Summary: Time is Running Out for a Bitcoin Rally Willy Woo’s recent analysis serves as a timely reminder of the importance of key technical levels and timeframes. The potential for a significant Bitcoin bearish divergence on the weekly chart hangs in the balance, contingent on price action over the next couple of days. If Bitcoin fails to rally and close the week strongly, the market could face a period of stagnation, impacting the overall Crypto market outlook . While not a guarantee of a crash, this warning from a respected voice in Bitcoin market analysis highlights a critical point for observation and potential strategy adjustment. Keeping a close watch on the weekly candle close and combining this technical insight with other forms of analysis will be crucial for navigating the market in the coming days and weeks.
