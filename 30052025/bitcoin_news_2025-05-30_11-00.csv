2025-05-30T08:54:05.000Z,"Crypto Remains Illegal in Pakistan Despite State-Led Bitcoin Initiatives","Despite increasing government-backed initiatives promoting Bitcoin adoption, Pakistan’s top financial authorities the State Bank and Ministry of Finance clarified on Thursday that cryptocurrency remains banned, with all related transactions deemed illegal under existing laws. As per local media reports , during a recent meeting official meeting on Finance and Revenue, Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal clarified that although the prime minister has established a Crypto Council, led by the finance minister through an executive order to explore digital asset policy, the country’s cryptocurrency ban remains firmly in place under regulations set by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) The central bank issued a directive in 2024 declaring Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies illegal, a position that remains unchanged. Pakistan’s Crypto Council CEO Bilal Bin Saqib, who was recently named as PM’s assistant on crypto and blockchain , announced at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas that the country is moving ahead with a Bitcoin reserve . Officials Highlight Crypto Policy Inconsistency Committee members voiced concern over the government’s inconsistency in regards to crypto policy, questioning why the public was being encouraged to invest in crypto despite its legal ban, warning that such actions could expose investors to serious risks. Recently Pakistan’s government announced to allocate 2,000 megawatts of electricity to power Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence (AI) data centres. Committee members raised questions about whether the bitcoin mining would be in government or private sector hands, and noted that illegal hawala channels would likely be replaced by unregulated digital transfers. Pakistan has committed 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity to fuel Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence centers. #Pakistan #Bitcoin https://t.co/WpnMyo5EgI — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 26, 2025 The State Bank of Pakistan does not recognize crypto assets. In 2022, the SBP issued an official advisory urging the public to exercise caution and avoid trading in cryptocurrencies. The committee’s debate on cryptocurrency was sparked by a proposed bill on digital currency regulations introduced by MNA Sharmila Farooqi. She emphasized the urgent need for a regulatory framework to curb potential money laundering risks, particularly in light of Pakistan’s recent removal from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list.

2025-05-30T08:52:07.000Z,"The MIND of Pepe Presale Ends in 24 Hours. Can You Afford to Skip This One?","The MIND of Pepe presale ends tomorrow; the last chance to buy $MIND is today. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) has accumulated over $11.3M in funding so far, with the final token price of $0.0037515. The presale is set to end in 24 hours at the time of writing this article. Once the project goes live, the MIND of Pepe Terminal will launch, making the token publicly available and welcoming investors into its ecosystem. What Is MIND of Pepe? MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is a self-sovereign intelligence with real-time hive-mind analysis. The AI agent coin is exclusively available to $MIND holders, which means that presale investors will get priority over everyone else. The AI agent is self-evolving, which means it learns and grows as it interacts with the community. The entity will engage with crypto fans on X and Telegram, making posts, offering market insights, sparking discussions, and making predictions based on objective market data. As the agent witnesses increased community support, it will eventually begin to launch its own tokens, exclusively available to $MIND holders before they hit the public sphere. These points explain why MIND of Pepe is currently one of the best presales in 2025. Analysts Target $0.0053 for $MIND by Year-End As to whether $MIND is worth it, the project’s utility and scope answer that plainly: yes. Our analysts have assessed the project’s market potential based on its projected utility and the answer may surprise you: If the project witnesses the same support it received during the presale phase, we expect $MIND to solidify its price around $0.00535 during 2025. This should bring early adopters an ROI of around 42% from today’s price. Things will change by the end of 2026 when, following the release of the AI agent, the token should witness a significant pump, taking it up to $0.0065 for an ROI of 73%. Finally, our analysts predict a 2030 price point of $0.035, taking the investment up by 832%. We base our predictions on multiple factors, such as: The project’s utility: Interacting with potential investors, offering valuable market analysis, and crafting its own projects. Growing investor interest during the presale: With over $11.3M in acquired capital and 1.6B tokens in the staking pool, MIND of Pepe witnessed a successful presale phase.

We also can’t account for dips that could see $MIND lose steam due to unpredictable delays in its development process, for instance. Why Should I Invest in MIND of Pepe? Good question. We would say there are two reasons why MIND of Pepe is a potentially worthy investment: The project’s long-term scope and goals as detailed in the roadmap The opportunity to diversify your portfolio with a token that promises good performance post-launch Whether you’re a long type of guy or a short dude, MIND of Pepe shows promise both ways.

2025-05-30T08:48:07.000Z,"Bitcoin Trader Loses Nearly $100 Million in Hyperliquid Long Bet Liquidation","James Wynn, a high-stakes trader on Hyperliquid , has suffered a near-$100 million loss after a series of leveraged long positions on Bitcoin were liquidated during a sudden market dip. Wynn, known for his aggressive trading strategies, saw his bold bets collapse on May 30 as Bitcoin’s price fell sharply below $105,000. Nearly 1,000 BTC Liquidated in Hours According to on-chain data from analytics platform Hypurrscan, two of Wynn’s largest positions were closed in quick succession. The first, a 527.29 BTC long valued at $55.3 million, was liquidated when Bitcoin dropped to $104,950. Moments later, another 421.8 BTC worth $43.9 million was wiped out as Bitcoin slid further to $104,150. These losses came on the heels of another 94 BTC ($10 million) liquidation on May 29 at $106,330. In total, Wynn lost 949 BTC — equating to approximately $99.3 million. Data from Lookonchain confirmed Wynn’s total losses over the past week hover just below the $100 million mark. Bitcoin reached to $105,000 on May 30, with some platforms reporting even deeper lows. Wynn’s positions were exposed to massive downside risk, as he had increased his 40x leveraged bet to $1.25 billion just days earlier, on May 24. That gamble backfired when the market reacted to geopolitical uncertainty and renewed tariff rhetoric from U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump. Wynn: “I Stand to Lose Everything” Following the dramatic liquidations, Wynn responded on X with a cryptic screenshot from The Matrix showing Neo stopping bullets — a subtle nod to the pressure he faced. Despite the losses, one of Wynn’s massive positions remains open: a 40x leveraged long contract entered at $107,993. According to Hypurrscan, it is currently showing an unrealized loss of $3.4 million. Wynn, who rose to fame after turning memecoin investments — particularly Pepe — into multi-million-dollar wins, appears unfazed by the volatility. A day before the liquidation, he described himself as an “extreme degenerate” and admitted to ignoring risk management. “I do not follow proper risk management… I’m effectively gambling. And I stand to lose everything,” Wynn warned — a candid reflection of the high-risk world of crypto leverage trading.

2025-05-30T08:46:25.000Z,"Bitcoin ETF Inflow Streak Ends After $347M Outflow Day","This latest outflow was the largest single-day outflow since March and ended a 10-day inflow streak. Fidelity’s FBTC and Grayscale’s GBTC led the outflows, while BlackRock’s IBIT stood out with a $125 million net inflow—its 34th straight day of gains. Meanwhile, spot Ether ETFs were able to stay resilient by drawing $92 million in inflows despite many holders being underwater due to ETH’s price decline. However, recent court decisions easing trade tensions revived sentiment. BlackRock has also been quietly increasing Bitcoin exposure via internal bond portfolios. Bitcoin Price Drop Triggers ETF Outflows US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded their first collective outflow in over two weeks on May 29, snapping a ten-day streak of net inflows. This was also the largest single-day outflow since March. The total net outflow amounted to $347 million, according to data from Farside Investors. This reflected the shift in market sentiment after Bitcoin’s price dropped by more than 3.5% during the day. The sharp price decline saw BTC fall from an intraday high of $108,850 to briefly dip below $105,000. Bitcoin ETF flow (Source: Farside Investors ) Among the ETFs, the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) registered the largest outflow after losing $166 million. This was followed by the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which shed $107.5 million. Other funds managed by Bitwise, Ark 21Shares, Invesco, Franklin Templeton, and VanEck also saw net outflows. However, funds like Grayscale’s mini Bitcoin trust, CoinShares, and WisdomTree experienced no flows. The only ETF to defy the trend was BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which attracted a net inflow of $125 million on the day. This was the fund’s 34th consecutive trading day of inflows, a streak that began after its last outflow on April 9. With nearly $4 billion in net inflows over the past two weeks alone, IBIT’s total inflows now stand at $49 billion, and its assets under management have surpassed $70 billion. ETF Store President Nate Geraci pointed out the divergence between crypto and traditional asset flows, and explained that more than $9 billion has entered spot Bitcoin ETFs in the past five weeks while nearly $3 billion exited gold ETFs during the same period. Meanwhile, spot Ether ETFs were more resilient during the Bitcoin pullback by posting a net inflow of $92 million on May 29. This extended their own inflow streak to ten consecutive trading days. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) led the charge with $50 million in net inflows, raising its total to $4.5 billion since its launch in July of 2024. Ethereum ETF flow (Source: Farside Investors ) Ether ETF Investors Deep in the Red Most investors in spot Ether ETFs launched by BlackRock and Fidelity are currently sitting on big unrealized losses. This is according to a new report from crypto analytics firm Glassnode. The report from May 29 found that the average investor in BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust and Fidelity’s Ethereum ETF is now down around 21%, with cost bases of $3,300 and $3,500 respectively. Ether is currently trading at approximately $2,610, which is well below these entry points. The decline in ETH’s price is partially attributed to macroeconomic pressures, particularly after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order imposing tariffs on imports from China, Canada, and Mexico. Ether last traded above $3,000 on Feb. 2, before entering a prolonged downtrend. The downturn intensified in April when the crypto hit a yearly low of $1,472 on April 9. This was the same day Trump’s global tariff package took effect. Glassnode’s analysis mentioned that outflows from Ether ETFs tended to accelerate when the asset dropped below the average investor’s cost basis, particularly during price declines in August of 2024, January, and March of 2025. However, a recent recovery provided some relief. ETH rebounded more than 44% over the past month, driven in part by easing fears around the trade war. On May 28, a US federal court blocked most of Trump’s tariffs, fueling optimism and contributing to nine consecutive days of inflows into Ether ETFs. ETH’s price action over the past month (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Since their US debut in July 2024, spot Ether ETFs have attracted close to $2.94 billion in inflows. At the time of their launch on July 23, Ether was trading around $3,536. Despite this capital influx, Glassnode noticed that the ETFs have had only a modest effect on Ethereum’s spot price. Initially, they accounted for just 1.5% of spot market trading volume. That figure rose to 2.5% in November 2024, coinciding with Trump’s re-election and a broader rally across the crypto market that briefly pushed ETH to $4,007 on Dec. 8. Since then, the ETFs’ market share slid back toward 1.5%. BlackRock Quietly Boosts Bitcoin ETF Holdings BlackRock has been steadily increasing its exposure to Bitcoin through internal portfolio allocations. According to recent filings with the US SEC, BlackRock’s Strategic Income Opportunities Portfolio held 2,123,592 shares of its own iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as of March 31, 2025. The position was valued at $99.4 million, which is a big increase from the 1,691,143 shares it held at the end of 2024. This move proved that Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a component of diversified return strategies, even in traditionally bond-heavy portfolios. The iShares Bitcoin Trust was launched in January of 2024 after the SEC’s approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs. It also very quickly became the dominant fund in its category. It currently manages over $70 billion in net assets, far outpacing its nearest competitor, Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), which trails by $50 billion. The Strategic Income Opportunities Portfolio is primarily focused on bonds but includes a mandate for seeking higher returns through exposure to a broad array of markets, including digital assets like Bitcoin. Institutional demand for Bitcoin ETFs are quite strong, with 2025 on track to mirror the explosive growth that was seen during the products’ first year. May has been particularly impressive, with spot Bitcoin ETFs attracting over $1.5 billion in net inflows in just two days. BlackRock’s IBIT played a central role in this trend by consistently recording sizable inflows since April 9. (Source: Bitwise ) Looking ahead, Bitwise Asset Management sees continued upside. In a recent report , its analysts projected that Bitcoin ETF inflows could reach $120 billion this year and potentially rise to $300 billion by 2026. Despite this robust growth, a major opportunity remains untapped. Bitwise shared that many traditional wealth management platforms and large wirehouses have not embraced Bitcoin ETFs just yet, which leaves a lot of room for even more institutional adoption in the coming years.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9373/bitcoin-etf-inflow-streak-ends-after-347-m-outflow-day,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-05-30T08:45:10.000Z,"India to drop a crypto regulation paper in June","India is reportedly set to drop a major discussion paper in June on crypto regulation. For a country that has hobbled between hardline tax moves and regulatory silence, this looks like a big shift. It is also a major signal that the government is warming up to the sector as industry prints fresh all-time highs (ATH). US President Donald Trump’s bold pro-crypto stance and the ongoing tariff tussle have led the global digital asset market to print green indexes. Bitcoin, the biggest crypto, smashed its new ATH of over $111,900 on May 22 before retracing back to the $105K levels. India to unveil crypto plan soon According to reports, the paper, which is expected to be released by India, will pull heavily from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) synthesis report. It might open the door for public input on how the country should handle the practices adopted by other jurisdictions. India’s take on crypto has been in the grey zone, as the Financial Year 23 budget imposed a harsh 30% tax on crypto gains, it stopped short of giving the sector legal recognition. Regulators have since forced exchanges to register with India’s Financial Intelligence Unit. Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of India has repeatedly flagged risks like money laundering and terror financing and even pushed its own CBDC as the safer option. The report mentioned that a senior government official said India will make its crypto decisions based on national interest, avoiding any “knee-jerk” reactions given the sector’s massive implications. Earlier, the Supreme Court of India slammed the central government for its long silence on crypto regulation. It warned that this legal vacuum is turning into a breeding ground for misuse. The court even grilled the government over when the biggest global economies are pushing forward with regulatory frameworks and India still hasn’t introduced any clear rules. A new report from think tank Esya Centre estimates that nearly 90% of Indian crypto trading has shifted offshore as a direct result of these regulations. It has eroded India’s foothold in the fast-expanding global crypto economy. Industry leaders warn that the current tax structure stifles innovation, pushes users toward unregulated markets. India’s top court demands crypto rules The US is doing some major reforms for the crypto community. Once a vocal crypto skeptic under Biden, Trump’s administration has pardoned several digital assets industry leaders and launched a strategic bitcoin reserve, and is pushing Congress to pass pro-crypto laws. Recently, Trump’s Senate passed stablecoin legislation; on the other hand, the EU’s MiCA regulation is already rolling out in real time. Against this backdrop, India’s Supreme Court said that it’s no longer acceptable to keep dodging the issue. A bench led by Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh highlighted that banning crypto isn’t the answer, but regulation is urgently needed. The cumulative crypto market cap registered a drop of more than 3% on Friday morning to stand at $3.31 trillion. Its 24-hour trading volume stood at $142.3 billion. After a brief rally, the Bitcoin price has stayed down by 5% over the past 7 days. One of the biggest gainers of the year, Ripple’s XRP price dropped by a huge 10% in the same period.

2025-05-30T08:44:19.000Z,"Samourai Wallet Files to Dismiss DOJ Case, Citing FinCEN Guidance","The co-founders of Bitcoin privacy app Samourai Wallet pushed back against the U.S. government’s criminal charges, arguing in a new court filing that the Department of Justice’s case should be thrown out because it breaks with years of Treasury Department policy and threatens to criminalize open-source software. Keonne Rodriguez and William Hill, charged with operating an unlicensed money transmitting business and conspiracy to commit money laundering, filed a joint motion asking a federal judge in Manhattan to dismiss the indictment. The pair's lawyers say Samourai Wallet never handled user funds and shouldn’t be considered a financial institution or a money transmitter under federal law. At the heart of the dispute is the distinction between custodial services, which take control of customer assets, and non-custodial tools like Samourai, which merely help users obscure blockchain transactions using a method called CoinJoin. According to the motion, Samourai users always retained control of their crypto, and the app simply coordinated privacy-enhancing transactions among them. The developers’ defense cited longstanding guidance from the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), that anonymizing software providers are not subject to money transmitter rules. “FinCEN never maintained that it was a money transmitting business that must be licensed. To the contrary, FinCEN consistently advised that companies and software apps that did not “accept” or “transmit” funds were not “money transmitting” businesses,” the filing reads. The defense argues that the Department of Justice’s charges mark a sharp and unprecedented break from that interpretation “in an apparent regulatory power struggle with FinCEN.” To them, the DOJ’s conduct is akin to “charging a shovel manufacturer because it may know murderers use shovels to bury victims” or “charging a burner phone manufacturer because it may know some customers use the phones to facilitate drug crimes.” In the motion, the lawyers warned that the DOJ’s theory could implicate a wide range of developers building privacy tools. Several crypto advocacy groups, including Coin Center and the DeFi Education Fund, have signaled interest in filing amicus briefs in support of the motion, warning that the case could chill innovation and infringe on civil liberties if allowed to proceed. The court is scheduled to hear arguments on July 22.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/05/30/samourai-wallet-files-to-dismiss-doj-case-citing-fincen-guidance,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY","Policy|Samourai Wallet|DOJ|lawsuits|US|News",cryptocompare

2025-05-30T08:15:16.000Z,"BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Reaches Record Low Volatility, Draws Billions in Flows","BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust exchange-traded fund (IBIT) is experiencing record-low volatility, according to Senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas , which is attracting more interest from larger investors looking for a \""digital gold\"" rather than speculative tech-like behavior. The 90-day rolling volatility of 47.64 is the lowest since the ETF was introduced in January 2024, Balchunas posted on X, a degree of stability that can be self-reinforcing. As volatility drops, larger and more risk-averse investors tend to enter, which in turn further suppresses volatility. \""The thing with volatility is it can become self-fulfilling,\"" Balchunas said in his post. \""The lower the volatility gets, the more bigger investors will bite who will help lower volatility even more. The same 'should' happen with correlation too. This is a direct result of the ‘suitcoiners.’” The trend is already underway, Balchunas said, citing IBIT’s outsized inflows in recent weeks. Since its debut, IBIT has pulled in $49 billion in net inflows, more than four times the amount invested into the second-ranked Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), which has attracted less than $12 billion, data from Farside Investors show. In contrast, Strategy (MSTR), the software company that has made buying bitcoin BTC a strategic priority, operates on a different appeal. MSTR attracts speculators and options traders who thrive on higher implied volatility (IV). However, even MSTR’s IV has dipped recently to 60%, with historical volatility at 49%, contributing to its muted price action .",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/30/blackrocks-bitcoin-etf-reaches-record-low-volatility-draws-billions-in-flows,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY","Markets|Bitcoin|Bitcoin ETF|Volatility|BlackRock|News",cryptocompare
2025-05-30T08:15:00.000Z,"Bitcoin price prediction 2025-2031: Will BTC hit $150k soon?","Key takeaways : Bitcoin price faces bearish correction toward $105K Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Ticker BTC Price $105,804 (-2%) Market cap $2.19 Trillion Trading volume (24-hour) $56.76 Billion (-38%) Circulating supply 19.86 Million BTC All-time high $111,970; May 22, 2025 All-time low $0.04865; Jul 15, 2010 24-hour high $108,910.55 24-hour low $104,684.72 Bitcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $110,019 Price Prediction $119,922 (+8.01%) Fear & Greed Index 78 (Extreme Greed) Sentiment Bullish Price Volatility (30-day variation) 5.04% Green Days 17/30 (60%) 50-Day SMA $93,698 200-Day SMA $86,424 14-Day RSI 77.24 Bitcoin price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: BTC price analysis shows that Bitcoin faced a rejection around $109K and triggered a decline. Resistance for BTC is at $108,944 Support for BTC/USD is at $104,718 The BTC price analysis for 30 May confirms that BTC faces a surge in bearish volatility as the price rejected the $109K level. As a result, sellers pushed the price toward immediate support channels below $106K. BTC price analysis 1-day chart: Bitcoin price hovers below $106K Analyzing the daily Bitcoin price chart, we see that BTC faced a surge toward $109K. However, sellers strongly defended further surges, resulting in a bearish correction below Fib channels toward $105K. The 24-hour volume has surged to $2.3 billion, showing a rise in trading interest today. BTC is trading at $105,804, declining by over 2% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin shows bearish volatility The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level but trades above the midline at 54, hinting that a bullish correction is on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. BTC/USD 4-hour price chart: Buyers strongly defend $105K support The 4-hour Bitcoin price chart suggests that bears are strengthening their position to hold the price below the $105K level. However, buyers strongly defended the decline below $105K, holding the price around EMA20 trend line. Bitcoin aims for immediate correction The BoP indicator trades in a bullish region at 0.42, showing that short-term buyers are taking a chance to accelerate an upward trend. However, the MACD trend line has formed red candles below the signal line, and the indicator aims for negative momentum, strengthening short-position holders’ confidence. Bitcoin technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $99,928 BUY SMA 5 $103,323 BUY SMA 10 $103,269 BUY SMA 21 $101,521 BUY SMA 50 $93,698 BUY SMA 100 $90,715 BUY SMA 200 $86,424 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $99,545 BUY EMA 5 $95,481 BUY EMA 10 $90,573 BUY EMA 21 $87,557 BUY EMA 50 $87,804 BUY EMA 100 $89,012 BUY EMA 200 $85,643 BUY What to expect from BTC price analysis next? The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC’s price holds momentum above $108,944, it will fuel a bullish rally to $112,255. BTC/USDT Chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $104,718, beginning a bearish trend to $102,183. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin down today? Bitcoin faced a surge in bearish pressure after the price peaked at $109K. This triggered short-term holders to exit their positions, resulting in the recent decline. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price recently broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $100K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Following the US, Pakistan announced its first government-backed strategic bitcoin reserve, marking a notable step towards adding crypto assets into its financial strategy. Bitcoin price prediction May 2025 Bitcoin’s Q1 2025 performance was notably weak, with a 12.5% loss, as per CoinGlass data, marking the worst first quarter since 2018. In the last few weeks of April, the price of Bitcoin recovered smoothly and touched a high around $95K. Will Bitcoin continue its recovery rally in May? Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $91,000 and be pushed further, at least $108,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $85,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction May 2025 $85,000 $91,000 $108,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history | Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-price-prediction/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|UNI","Crypto Price Predictions|BTC",cryptocompare
2025-05-30T08:14:12.000Z,"Dogecoin Dives 9%; Cardano’s ADA, SOL Slump 6% as Renewed Tariff Fears Jolt Markets","Dogecoin DOGE nosedived 9%, while Cardano’s ADA ADA and Solana’s SOL SOL each fell 6% in the past 24 hours as Trump’s reinstated tariffs reignited trade tensions. A swift legal reversal saw the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issue a temporary stay on Wednesday’s lower court ruling that had struck down the tariffs, allowing them to remain in place while the government appeals. The tariffs, announced on April 2 and dubbed “Liberation Day” duties by Trump, target nearly all U.S. trading partners and were imposed under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Bitcoin BTC slid below $106,000 while ether ETH lost the $2,700 mark amid the renewed uncertainty. The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid index tracking the largest tokens by market capitalization, fell 4%. “The price of Bitcoin fell after Trump’s tariffs were reinstated by an appeals court, while U.S. GDP figures showed the economy shrank in the first quarter,” said Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, in a Telegram message. “Gold surged higher as jobless claims increased and corporate profits fell. Although the Fed continues to see inflation as a threat, we’re optimistic that Bitcoin will rebound as investors look for long-term value holds during volatile market fluctuations,” Ruck added. Market sentiment appeared cautious, with the total crypto market capitalization flat at $3.42 trillion. “Cryptocurrencies prefer not to notice positive stock market movements as they are related to tariffs and company reports, not money supply,” noted Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FxPro, in an email to CoinDesk. “Bitcoin retreated from the trading range’s upper boundary at $110k to its lower boundary at $107K.

2025-05-30T08:10:59.000Z,"Solana price prediction: here’s why SOL is crashing and what next","Solana price has come under pressure this week as the crypto market crash accelerated. After peaking at $187 last week, the coin has pulled back to $159, and there are signs that the sell-off will gain steam. SOL was trading at $164.2 on Friday, down by 45% from the highest point this month. Solana price technical analysis The daily chart shows that the SOL price is at risk of further downwside in the coming days. That’s because the coin has formed a double-top pattern at $184.5 on the twelve-hour chart. This pattern is made up of two peaks and a neckline, which, in this case, is at $159.45. A double-top pattern is one of the most accurate chart patterns in technical analysis as it sends a signal that investors are afraid to buy an asset above a certain price. In Solana’s case, investors are afraid of placing bids above the double-top point at $184.5 and the 50% Fibonacci Retracement level at $195. Read more: Crypto price predictions today: Popcat, Worldcoin, Zebec Network It has moved below the 50-period moving average, a sign that bears are in control for now. Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and other oscillators have all pointed downwards, signaling that the downtrend is continuing. The distance between the upper side of the double-top and the neckline is about 14%. Measuring the same distance from the neckline brings the target price to $136, which is a few points below the 23.6% retracement point. The bearish Solana price forecast will be invalidated if it moves above the resistance point at $184.5. SOL price chart | Source: TradingView Why SOL is plunging There are a few reasons why the Solana price is in a downward trend. First, the decline is because of the ongoing crypto market crash , with Bitcoin falling from $111,900 last week to $106,000 today. A Bitcoin retreat often leads to more downside among most altcoins, including Solana. Second, investors are dumping Solana meme coins. CoinGecko data shows that the market cap of all Solana meme coins has dropped from over $15 billion last week to over $11.4 billion today. Most of them, have tumbled in the last few days, with Fartcoin falling by 28% in the last seven days and Dogwifhat dropping by 18%. Other top Solana meme coins like Bonk, Pudgy Penguins, Popcat, and Cat in a dogs world have all plunged by over 20%. This plunge has had an impact on Solana’s ecosystem, with the 24-hour volume in its DEX protocols falling from to $2.23 billion. Those in the BSC Chain and Ethereum handled $12.3 billion and $3.4 billion. The total supply of stablecoins in Solana’s network continues falling. It moved from a high of $13 billion earlier this month to $11.5 billion, and the trend is continuing. Additionally, Solana’s funding rate has turned negative, a sign that investors expect the future price to be lower than the current one. Therefore, a combination of tough macroeconomic news on trade, coupled with weak internal numbers mean that the Solana price will continue falling in the near term. Besides, June is usually the worst month for cryptocurrencies.

2025-05-30T08:04:07.000Z,"Arthur Hayes Reveals His 2025 Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction! \""Ethereum Is The Most Hated Altcoin Right Now, But…\""","Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes, who attracted attention with his bold and ambitious statements about Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins, made important statements about Ethereum. Speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference, Arthur Hayes predicted that Ethereum could reach $5,000 this year. Hayes argued that Ethereum could potentially reach a new all-time high despite its recent underperformance compared to rival cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Solana (SOL). The celebrity said that ETH is currently the most hated layer-1 blockchain and that historically the most disliked assets tend to provide the best returns when market cycles turn. According to Hayes, this suggests that ETH could double and outperform. “I think ETH could go to $4,000 or $5,000 this year. “I think ETH is the most hated tier-1 asset right now. And usually at some point in the cycle you want to be in the most hated asset, so I think ETH could outperform.” Apart from Hayes, Geoffrey Kendrick, Head of Digital Assets at Standard Chartered, also stated that he has an bullish expectation for Etheruem and shared that he has a price target of $4,000 for 2025 and $7,500 for 2029. As a result, a jump to $4,000, which is seen as the common denominator and lower bound of Kendrick and Hayes’ price prediction range, would represent a jump of approximately 50% from ETH’s current price of $2,640. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-30T08:03:43.000Z,"Two Ways This Bitcoin Bull Market is Sturdier Than 2020-21 and 2017","Bitcoin BTC has long been criticized for its high volatility, with bull runs marked by sudden, sharp pullbacks that would qualify as full-blown bear trends in stocks. However, the latest bull market, which kicked off in early 2023, feels different in a positive way, exhibiting relatively low volatility and drawdowns. Volatility in downtrend According to data tracked by Glassnode, bitcoin's realized volatility on a three-month rolling basis has averaged less than 50% during this bull cycle, significantly lower than the 80% to 100% observed during previous bull runs. The same thing can be said about the 30-day implied volatility, tracked by Volmex's BVIV index, which has been in a downtrend, according to data source TradingView. The implied volatility refers to the expected price turbulence over a specific period and is a forward-looking metric. The stability likely stems from bitcoin's ever-growing market capitalization, which inadvertently fosters stability and increased institutional participation through ETFs and derivatives. \""Boasting a market capitalization of over $2T, Bitcoin now ranks as the 7th largest asset worldwide. As liquidity deepens, and the valuation of an asset reaches these heights, the capital required to meaningfully move the price of the asset becomes significantly larger,\"" Glassnode said, explaining the volatility meltdown. \""Additionally, the launch of the US Spot ETF Products, supplemented by increasing regulatory clarity, has altered the underlying composition of the investor base, allowing sophisticated, institutional investors and capital to gain exposure to bitcoin for the first time,\"" Glassnode added. Stair-step rally Pull up the price chart from 2020-21, and you'll see that bitcoin's then-bull run from $4,000 to $70,000 had several steep price pullbacks, sometimes more than 30%. In traditional markets, a drawdown of over 20% is typically considered a bear market. Now compare it to the rally from roughly $30,000 to over $100,000 since March 2023, and the picture looks different. It has been a stair-step ascent, characterized by an impulsive move higher followed by broad accumulation ranges that set the stage for the next leg higher. \""We’ve observed a shallower drawdown profile relative to previous bull markets, with the current cycle drawdowns generally less than -25% from the local high, with only two instances exceeding -30%,\"" Glassnode said. The change in character is again linked to institutional participation, lower leverage and speculative excesses in the broader market. Major exchanges, including Binance, offered 100X leverage during the previous bull runs, allowing investors to control a significantly larger trading position. Such use of leverage helped investors juice up profits but also magnified losses, resulting in liquidation cascades and frequent double-digit price corrections. However, exchanges eventually cut down the leverage significantly, curbing speculative excesses. That seems to have contributed to the sturdier rally this time.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/30/two-ways-this-bitcoin-bull-market-is-sturdier-than-2020-21-and-2017,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX","Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|market analysis|News",cryptocompare
2025-05-30T08:00:24.000Z,"Ethereum Repeating Early 2024’s Playbook – $3,800 Target In Sight?","This week, Ethereum (ETH) has reclaimed the $2,600 level as support for the first time since February, and it’s pushing to retest the next key resistance after a breakout from a short-term pattern. Some analysts suggest that ETH’s rally could target its Macro Range high area in the coming weeks. Ethereum Resembles 2024 Setup After struggling to break past the $2,600 mark, Ethereum has reclaimed this level as support. Over the past two days, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has held this key level while attempting to break above the $2,700 mark. Since recovering from its sub-$2,000 dip earlier this month, ETH hovered between $2,400 and $2,600, failing to reclaim the range’s upper zone despite its $2,738 multi-month high on May 10. Nonetheless, this week’s rally has seen the cryptocurrency rise above its local range and attempt to gain more strength to stop its sideways trajectory and continue its 50% recovery rally. Analyst Titan of Crypto noted that ETH just broke out of a two-week bullish flag, leading to today’s surge to the $2,788 level. He suggested that if the breakout is confirmed, the pattern’s target sits around the $3,800 level. Crypto Jelle pointed out that Ethereum is “still moving as planned, pushing deeper into the resistance area” around the $2,850 mark. Several analysts have named this level as the resistance before the $3,000 mark, and the wall “standing in the way of altseason.” Rekt Capital highlighted that Ethereum has been successfully retesting a crucial horizontal level since re-entering its $2,220-$3,900 Macro Range. Notably, Ethereum has been closing above the $2,468 mark for the past four weeks, setting up the stage for a “lift across the range.” With this successful retest, the King of Altcoins is “repeating early 2024 history.” Notably, ETH recorded a 50% four-week breakout after smashing the $2,486 resistance and retesting it as support. However, “the only difference is that it has just taken longer this time,” the analyst added. ETH Gains Momentum Meanwhile, analyst Ted Pillows considers that ETH is showing strength as its trading pair against Bitcoin (BTC) gains momentum and BTC dominance motion seemingly fades. The analyst also noted the ETH’s Weekly MACD bullish cross and reclaim of its multi-year support trendline. Based on this, he forecasted that Ethereum could soon soar to the $4,000 resistance. It’s worth noting that Ethereum is outperforming the flagship cryptocurrency this quarter for the first time since 2022, registering a 45% increase since April 1. Additionally, ETH continues to hold above its key level despite BTC’s dip below the $106,800 support. Related Reading: Bitcoin $106,800 Support Retest To Determine Next Move – Breakout Or Breakdown Ahead? Merlijn The Trader highlighted ETH’s price action after its golden cross, which appears to resemble its performance from the last time the setup occurred. According to the post, during the November 2024 setup, Ethereum saw a small dip before a “massive pump” on the eleventh day. “This time? Pump already started. We’re right on schedule,” the trader affirmed. As of this writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,642, a 44.7% increase in the monthly timeframe.

2025-05-30T07:48:22.000Z,"How Will the Crypto Market React to Bitcoin & Ethereum Options Expiry Today?","The post How Will the Crypto Market React to Bitcoin & Ethereum Options Expiry Today? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is bracing for a big event today, just one day after the Bitcoin Conference 2025 wrapped up in Las Vegas on May 29. The conference, filled with optimism and new ideas, has set a hopeful tone. But now, with more than $11 billion in Bitcoin and Ethereum options expiring today, traders are worried that this will lead to massive volatility ahead. $9.8B Bitcoin Options Expiry Today According to data from Deribit , a leading crypto derivatives platform, around 92,459 Bitcoin contracts will expire today. These contracts are worth nearly $9.8 billion, a significant jump from last week’s figures. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at around $105,982, down about 1.9% in the past 24 hours. The maximum pain price, the level where most options lose money, is $100,000. Although this is below the current price, analysts think Bitcoin won’t drop all the way to that level. Traders have set a put-to-call ratio of 0.89, showing more bets on price gains. $1.6 Billion Ethereum Options Expiry Ethereum is also seeing a big expiry day, with 623,949 contracts worth about $1.6 billion set to expire today, again according to Deribit data. Ethereum’s price is currently at $2,600, down about 4% in the past 24 hours. Its maximum pain price is $2,300, while the put-to-call ratio of 0.81 suggests that traders still believe prices could go higher. How the Crypto Market Could React Today This week’s Bitcoin and Ethereum options expiry is much bigger, covering the whole month. Historically, big monthly expiries like this can lead to short-term volatility, as traders adjust their positions or hedge against sudden price swings. Meanwhile, Bitcoin traders seem split, as some hope for a price rise, while others are cautious and ready to protect themselves. On the other hand Ethereum’s market looks balanced, with chances to grow but also some caution. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-30T07:30:47.000Z,"Ross Ulbricht Gets Hero’s Welcome at Bitcoin 2025, Says ‘Fight for Freedom isn’t Over’","Ross Ulbricht made his first public appearance at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas as a free man, after spending over a decade in prison for his role in running the darknet website Silk Road, before U.S. President Trump pardoned him . An emotional Ross thanked the Bitcoin community for its continuous support. On 29 May 2015, a federal judge had sent Ross to serve a double-life sentence plus 40 years in prison without the possiblity of parole. Silk Road founder reflected on his time in prison saying, “there were days when I thought I would die in that awful cage,” but he fought to find joy even in the darkest time. Addressing the attendees, Ross said that the idea he risked his life and lost freedom for, grew into a movement. A movement so big that a decade later it came back around to free him, he added. “There is still more freedom to be won” Ross revealed that after he appeared at Bitcoin conference in 2021 through a phone call from prison, he was thrown into solitary confinement and put under heavy surveillance. But he said it was worth it and it made him feel like that for a moment he broke through the prison. “Today is the mirror image of that,” he noted. Talking about winning back his freedom, he said, “winning your freedom feels as amazing as losing it feels awful.” Ross declared from the stage that we’re not there yet, there is still more freedom to be won and there’s still more work to be done. “Freedom is worth the struggle,” he added. Ross is catching up with latest technology Ross Ulbricht is still catching up with the technology after coming out of a “time capsule.” He noted: “I effectively went into a time capsule in 2013 and now I’m coming out like Rip Van Winkle. I mean, just a few months ago when I walked out of prison, I’d never seen a drone. I had never experienced VR or chatted with AI.” Talking about the developments in the crypto industry since he went to prison, Ross said, when he launched Silk Road there was just one exchange you could buy bitcoin on. “Now, it seems like every app I download has a built-in wallet with one-click buying options.” He added that There are dozens of new cryptocurrencies and blockchains, each one fascinating in its own right. “There’s DeFi and Web 3 and now there’s AI to help me navigate it all. It’s nuts.” In a heartfelt video montage that played before he took the stage, scenes of Ulbricht adjusting to life beyond prison filled the screen. He was seen walking on the beach, learning to surf, sharing quiet moments with his wife and enjoying the newfound freedom. “Freedom, decentralization and unity” Ross concluded his speech by reminding the bitcoin community about the three core principles that they should stick by to grow further – freedom, decentralization and unity. Recalling his time in prison, Ross said that guards and administration like when prisoners are divided, that way it’s easier to rule them. But when the prisoners were united, the administration listened, he added. “When we all went on hunger strike together, they showed up and listened.” Ross urged the crypto community to not see each other as enemies. “So long as we can agree that we deserve freedom and that decentralization is how we secure it, then we can be united, we can have each other’s backs, just like you had mine, freedom, decentralization, unity. Stay true to these principles and the future is ours.” The post Ross Ulbricht Gets Hero’s Welcome at Bitcoin 2025, Says ‘Fight for Freedom isn’t Over’ appeared first on Cryptonews .",cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/ross-ulbricht-gets-heros-welcome-at-bitcoin-2025/,"BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY","Bitcoin News|Bitcoin|Ross Ulbricht",cryptocompare

Hence, we expect the BTC price to create a 2025 high of ~$168,000. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $71,827.81 $119,713.02 $167,598.22 Bitcoin Price Prediction June 2025 In May 2025, Bitcoin’s unstoppable ascent showed a nice and steady rise. This recovery was possible due to easing tensions from the trade tariffs war, which led BTC to surge to a new all-time high of $112K. The price fell back recently as a post by Donald Trump brought back the trade tensions with european union this time, which led to a brief dip to $108K. But, 48 hours later he paused the recent impose with EU until June 9th.This move stopped the situation to get worsened. However, despite that, bears took it down to $105K, and recently it is taking 20-day EMA support. When the pause was announced, it seemed like the positivity and bullish narratives would quickly return to the table from crypto traders, and it would take out the $112K resistance, but the bulls’ strength felt short to flip $112K.. Now, in the past couple of days, its price action is withdrawing back from its all-time high level, and it seems like it is on the verge of falling to the 50-day EMA band in the short term, around $ 100 K. Also, the Market sentiment has shifted from optimistic to pessimistic. The BTC long/short ratio currently stands at 0.9501, which has declined from 1.0288, indicating that bulls have weakened. This shows that bullish forces have halted the momentum in the short term, and bears are not on the sidelines anymore; they are kicking in to push the price lower. However, if a situation changes in the short term and bearishness wanes, then the newly formed all-time high must be taken out. If it does, then it will enter price discovery mode. In that condition, BTC could target a near-term target of $120,000, with the potential for even higher levels in the coming months. However, if bulls fail toreignite momentum then a pullback to $100,000 or lower, could be likely. Supporting this cautious view, on-chain data reveals that a substantial amount of dormant Bitcoin, unmoved for 1 to 2 years, 180-days to 1year, and 90-days to 180 days has recently become active. This kind of movement is often interpreted as a bearish signal, suggesting that short-term holders below 2 years might be preparing to sell. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 A key factor driving the potential for higher Bitcoin prices is the relationship with global liquidity. Historical trends reveal that as global M2 increases, Bitcoin often experiences dramatic price surges. Now, with global liquidity beginning to rise again after a prolonged period of stagnation, the stage seems set for another major rally in Bitcoin’s value. This shift in liquidity could create the perfect environment for Bitcoin to soar once more. Also, cryptoquant data suggest that accumulation is on top with exchange reserve declining at more alarming rates. When writing 2.4 Milliion BTC were in total on the exchange reserves, which is a strong decline from a year ago when reserves were 3.1 Million BTC.

2025-05-30T07:20:12.000Z,"Pantera Capital’s Smart Strategy: Investing in Companies with Crypto Reserves","BitcoinWorld Pantera Capital’s Smart Strategy: Investing in Companies with Crypto Reserves Are you curious about how major players in the crypto space are navigating the market? Investment strategies are constantly evolving, and Pantera Capital, a prominent name in cryptocurrency investment, recently revealed a fascinating approach. They are looking beyond direct investment in digital assets and putting capital into publicly listed companies that hold significant crypto reserves on their balance sheets. This move signals a growing trend in how institutional players view and interact with the digital asset ecosystem. Why are Companies Building Crypto Reserves ? The idea of a company holding cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum as part of its corporate treasury might seem unconventional to some, but it’s a strategy gaining traction. Companies adopt this approach for various reasons: Inflation Hedge: With concerns about fiat currency devaluation, some companies see assets like Bitcoin as a potential store of value that can appreciate over time, preserving purchasing power. Balance Sheet Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset class like crypto can diversify a company’s holdings beyond traditional cash, bonds, and stocks. Alignment with Future Technologies: For companies operating in or adjacent to the tech sector, holding crypto can align their balance sheet with the decentralized future they might be building or interacting with. Attracting Talent and Investors: For some, having crypto reserves can signal forward-thinking leadership and potentially appeal to employees and investors interested in the digital asset space. This trend of companies accumulating crypto reserves provides a new avenue for investors like Pantera Capital to gain exposure to the digital asset market indirectly. Exploring Pantera Capital’s Investment Choices Pantera Capital, in a note to its investors, highlighted specific companies they have invested in due to their strategic decision to hold cryptocurrencies. This provides concrete examples of their strategy in action. According to reports, these include: Twenty One Capital: Described as a cryptocurrency venture company with a focus on Bitcoin investments. Investing here provides Pantera exposure to a company whose core business revolves around the leading cryptocurrency. DeFi Development: This entity has reportedly adopted Solana (SOL) as a strategic reserve asset. This investment gives Pantera exposure not just to a specific altcoin, but to a company actively involved in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, utilizing SOL within that ecosystem. SharpLink Gaming: This company has chosen to hold Ethereum (ETH) as a reserve asset. Investing in SharpLink Gaming offers Pantera exposure to a company in the gaming sector that sees value in holding the second-largest cryptocurrency, likely recognizing its importance in areas like NFTs and decentralized applications. These examples showcase Pantera’s diversified approach, targeting companies holding different key cryptocurrencies, reflecting varying strategic decisions by those companies. Is This a Smarter Institutional Investment Strategy? Pantera Capital articulated a clear rationale for investing in these companies rather than just buying the underlying cryptocurrencies directly. They believe this approach can offer greater upside potential . But why might that be the case? Investing in a public company holding crypto reserves means you are not just betting on the price movement of the crypto asset itself. You are also investing in the company’s core business, its growth prospects, management, and operational efficiency. If the company is successful in its primary business while also benefiting from the appreciation of its crypto holdings, the investment’s return could potentially outperform a simple direct investment in the crypto asset alone. Consider a scenario where a company uses its crypto reserves strategically, perhaps leveraging them for financing, integrating them into services, or simply benefiting from their balance sheet value while its main operations generate significant profit. The value derived from the successful core business combined with the crypto appreciation could provide a compounding effect not available through direct crypto ownership. Furthermore, investing in publicly listed companies often comes with layers of regulation, reporting requirements, and corporate governance that might appeal to large institutional investment firms seeking structures they are familiar with. What are the Potential Benefits of This Approach? For an investor like Pantera Capital, and potentially for other institutional investment firms considering similar strategies, the benefits can be numerous: Indirect Exposure with Structure: Gaining exposure to crypto price movements through regulated, publicly traded entities. Potential for Compounded Returns: Upside from both the underlying crypto asset’s performance and the company’s business growth. Access to Specific Sectors: Investing in companies allows targeted exposure to sectors like gaming, DeFi, or venture capital that are actively using or focused on specific cryptocurrencies. Familiar Investment Vehicle: Public stocks are a traditional asset class, making this strategy potentially easier to integrate into existing portfolios and risk management frameworks compared to direct crypto holdings. Regulatory Clarity (Relative): While crypto regulation is evolving, investing in a regulated public company provides a degree of familiarity and existing legal frameworks. This method provides a nuanced way to participate in the crypto market’s growth, blending traditional equity investment with digital asset exposure. Are There Downsides or Challenges? No investment strategy is without its risks. Investing in companies with crypto reserves introduces unique challenges: Double-Edged Sword of Volatility: The company’s stock price can be affected by both the volatility of its core business and the extreme volatility of its crypto holdings. Company-Specific Risk: You are exposed to the operational risks, management decisions, and financial health of the specific company, independent of the crypto market. Valuation Complexity: Valuing a company with significant, volatile crypto assets on its balance sheet can be more complex than valuing a traditional company or simply valuing the crypto asset itself. Correlation Risk: In market downturns, both the company’s stock and its crypto reserves might fall in tandem, amplifying losses. Tax and Accounting Issues: How companies manage and report their crypto reserves can introduce accounting complexities that might impact their financial statements. Investors must carefully evaluate both the company’s fundamentals and the potential impact of its crypto holdings. How Does This Differ from Direct Crypto Investment? Directly buying Bitcoin , Ethereum , or Solana means you own the asset itself. Your investment performance is directly tied to the price fluctuations of that specific cryptocurrency. Investing in a company with crypto reserves adds a layer of indirection. With direct crypto, you manage your own wallets, keys, and security. With company stock, you rely on the company’s management to handle the custody and strategic use of the crypto assets. Direct crypto offers pure exposure to the asset’s price. Investing in a company offers exposure to the asset’s price *plus* the performance of the company’s business. For large institutional investment firms, the infrastructure, regulatory environment, and reporting requirements around public equities are often more established than those for direct crypto holdings, making the company-based approach potentially more accessible or preferable for certain mandates. What Does This Mean for the Future of Institutional Investment ? Pantera Capital’s strategy is indicative of a broader trend: institutional capital is finding increasingly sophisticated ways to enter the crypto market. While direct investment in Bitcoin ETFs and other funds is growing, strategies involving equity in crypto-exposed companies offer alternative risk/reward profiles. As more companies adopt crypto reserves, either as a treasury strategy or because their business involves digital assets, the universe of investable public companies with significant crypto exposure will likely grow. This provides traditional investors and crypto-focused funds like Pantera more options beyond simply buying crypto directly. This evolution suggests that the lines between traditional finance and the crypto world will continue to blur, creating new hybrid investment opportunities and strategies for sophisticated investors. Conclusion: A Strategic Evolution in Crypto Exposure Pantera Capital’s investment in publicly listed companies holding crypto reserves represents a notable strategic move in the institutional investment landscape. By targeting entities like Twenty One Capital, DeFi Development, and SharpLink Gaming, which hold assets like Bitcoin , Solana, and Ethereum , Pantera aims to capture potentially greater upside than direct crypto investment alone. This approach leverages the growth potential of both the underlying digital assets and the companies’ core businesses. While this strategy introduces unique complexities and risks compared to direct crypto ownership, it offers a structured, potentially more familiar pathway for large investors to gain exposure to the burgeoning digital asset class. It underscores the maturing of the crypto market and the innovative ways institutional capital is finding to participate in its future.

Here Are the Details","US-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced a total net outflow of $358.6 million on Thursday, ending a 10-day streak of positive inflows totaling $4.26 billion across 12 ETFs. US Spot Bitcoin ETFs See $358 Million Net Outflow: 10-Day Inflow Streak Ends BlackRock’s IBIT fund was the exception of the day, recording net inflows of $125 million alone, according to data provider SoSoValue. Other major providers suffered significant losses: Fidelity's FBTC fund: $166.32 million exit Grayscale's GBTC fund: $107.53 million exit Ark & 21Shares’ ARKB fund: $89.22 million exit Bitwise's BITB fund: $70.85 million exit Other ETF providers including VanEck, Valkyrie, Invesco and Franklin Templeton also reported outflows. Thursday’s outflows represent the largest daily net outflow in spot Bitcoin ETFs since March 11. Total trading volume in the ETFs rose to $5.39 billion from $3.5 billion the day before. Despite the outflows, IBIT’s strong performance was notable. IBIT led most of the 10-day inflow series, attracting over $4 billion in funds alone during that time. The total cumulative net inflow of ETFs was $45.34 billion on Wednesday, but fell to $44.99 billion as of Thursday. Meanwhile, US-listed spot Ethereum ETFs recorded net inflows for the ninth consecutive day, with a total of $91.93 million entering these funds on Thursday. Market Movements Bitcoin was traded at $106,204, down 1.38% in the last 24 hours. Ethereum fell 3.3% to $2,639.

Are traditional investors selling US Treasuries to buy bitcoin? pic.twitter.com/QKR8YgcyPP — André Dragosch, PhD (@Andre_Dragosch) May 29, 2025 Highlighting a chart titled “Rolling Correlation: 10-Year UST Futures”, Dragosch has revealed that the 60-day correlation between Bitcoin and the US 10-Year Treasury Futures has plummeted to its lowest level ever recorded. The revelation has triggered a serious discussion on ‘are traditional investors selling US Treasuries to buy Bitcoin?’ US 10-Year Treasury Yield: A Simple Analysis At the start of April, the US 10-Year Bond Yield was 4.213%. Though at a point on April 4, it slipped as low as 3.859%, between April 7 and 11, it climbed steeply by 15.44%. On April 11, it hit the month’s peak of 4.590%. After hitting the peak, the market witnessed two minor corrections that month: a 4.48% correction b/w April 14 and 16 and a 4.34% correction b/w April 24 and 29. In the early half of this month, the US 10-Year Bond Yield saw a steady rise. Between May 1 and 21, it surged by 9.99%. At one point on May 22, it reached a peak of 4.629%. Currently, the yield sits at 4.420% – at least 4.49% below the peak of the month. Bitcoin Price Action: An Overview At the beginning of April, the Bitcoin price was $82,497.20. Although between April 1 and 8, the price dropped by 10.27%, between April 9 and 30, it almost steadily grew by 23.34%. In the early half of this month, the Bitcoin market also witnessed a steep increase. Between May 1 and 22 alone, the market jumped by 18.63%, from $94,123.24 to a peak of $11,653.95. Since May 23, the market has dropped by over 5.16%. A Final Note During May, both US 10-Year Treasury Yield and Bitcoin price saw significant increases, indicating a risk-on environment where both traditional safe assets and riskier assets were bought. However, Bitcoin’s initial April drop while yields also fluctuated, then its subsequent strong recovery coinciding with rising yields, hints at some capital rotation into Bitcoin as bond attractiveness waned. The subsequent minor corrections in both assets at the end of April and May suggest some profit-taking or shifting market sentiment. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-30T07:10:35.000Z,"Tether Reserves Reveal Massive Bitcoin and Gold Holdings, Boosting Confidence in USDT Stablecoin","BitcoinWorld Tether Reserves Reveal Massive Bitcoin and Gold Holdings, Boosting Confidence in USDT Stablecoin Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin, USDT, frequently finds itself under the spotlight regarding the assets backing its value. Maintaining transparency around its reserves is crucial for user trust and the stability of the broader cryptocurrency market. Recent disclosures from Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas offered a significant update on the composition of the company’s Tether reserves, highlighting substantial Bitcoin holdings and considerable Gold reserves. What Exactly Did Tether Disclose About Its Crypto Reserves? Speaking to attendees, Paolo Ardoino confirmed that Tether holds over 100,000 BTC. At the time of the announcement, this Bitcoin holdings position was valued at more than $10 billion, underscoring Tether’s significant stake in the leading cryptocurrency. Beyond digital assets, Ardoino also revealed that Tether possesses over 50 tons of physical gold as part of its Tether reserves, adding a traditional safe-haven asset to its portfolio. This announcement, reported by CoinDesk, provides a more granular look at the assets underpinning the USDT stablecoin, which aims to maintain a 1:1 peg with the U.S. dollar. While Tether regularly publishes attestations regarding its reserves, specific details like the exact amounts of particular assets like Bitcoin and gold offer valuable insight into their strategy and the depth of their backing. Why Are Strong Stablecoin Reserves So Important? The stability and trustworthiness of a stablecoin like USDT are directly tied to the quality and accessibility of its underlying reserves. These reserves are the assets that stablecoin issuers hold to back the value of the tokens in circulation. When a user wants to redeem their USDT, Tether is expected to be able to provide them with the equivalent value in U.S. dollars or other assets. Key functions of robust stablecoin reserves include: Maintaining the Peg: Sufficient reserves allow the issuer to manage supply and demand, buying back tokens if the price dips below the peg or issuing new ones if demand drives the price above. Enabling Redemptions: Users need confidence that they can redeem their stablecoins for the underlying asset (in USDT’s case, USD) at any time. Strong, liquid reserves ensure this capability. Building Trust: Transparency and strength in reserves are fundamental to building and maintaining user trust in the stablecoin issuer and the token itself. Tether’s disclosure of specific, large crypto reserves like Bitcoin holdings and Gold reserves is intended to reinforce this trust by demonstrating tangible asset backing. What Do These Massive Bitcoin Holdings Signify? Tether has publicly stated its strategy to allocate a portion of its profits into investments, including Bitcoin. Holding over 100,000 BTC makes Tether one of the most significant non-public company holders of Bitcoin globally. This indicates: Confidence in Bitcoin: Tether views Bitcoin as a valuable asset class and a potential store of value, suitable for inclusion in its Tether reserves. Diversification Strategy: Including Bitcoin diversifies the reserve portfolio beyond traditional assets like Treasury Bills, potentially offering different risk/reward characteristics. Market Impact: While these holdings weren’t acquired overnight, Tether’s continuous accumulation has likely been a factor in Bitcoin’s market dynamics, positioning them as a major player in the crypto reserves space. This level of Bitcoin holdings adds a substantial, albeit volatile, component to the stablecoin reserves. Is Gold Reserves Tether’s Play for Traditional Investors? The inclusion of over 50 tons of physical gold is a notable aspect of Tether’s Tether reserves strategy. Gold has historically been seen as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. By holding physical gold, Tether is adding a tangible, widely recognized store of value to its backing assets. This could potentially appeal to a broader range of investors, including those more comfortable with traditional assets than purely digital ones. The decision to include Gold reserves suggests a move towards a more diversified and perhaps more conservative element within the crypto reserves mix, balancing newer digital assets like Bitcoin with established traditional assets. How Does This Disclosure Impact Confidence in the USDT Stablecoin? Transparency regarding stablecoin reserves has been a major point of discussion and sometimes contention in the crypto industry. By publicly stating the specific amounts of significant assets like Bitcoin and gold, Tether aims to increase confidence in the backing of the USDT stablecoin. For many users and market participants, knowing that tangible and high-value assets form a significant part of the Tether reserves provides reassurance. While discussions about the full auditability and liquidity of all reserve components continue, this direct disclosure from the CEO at a major industry event is a step towards greater openness regarding their stablecoin reserves. Key Takeaways for Readers: Tether holds significant amounts of both Bitcoin (over 100k BTC) and physical gold (over 50 tons) in its reserves. These assets form a substantial part of the backing for the USDT stablecoin. Holding Bitcoin reflects a strategic investment and diversification into digital assets. Holding gold adds a traditional, tangible store of value to the Tether reserves. These disclosures aim to increase transparency and confidence in Tether’s ability to back USDT. Paolo Ardoino’s announcement at Bitcoin 2025 provides a clear snapshot of two major components within the Tether reserves: massive Bitcoin holdings and substantial Gold reserves. This revelation underscores Tether’s strategy to diversify its backing assets and reinforces its position as a major player not just in stablecoins but also as a significant holder of key traditional and digital assets. For users of the USDT stablecoin and observers of the crypto reserves market, this transparency is a crucial factor in evaluating the stablecoin’s reliability and the overall health of the stablecoin reserves landscape.

2025-05-30T07:00:19.000Z,"Unlock Bitcoin Yield: Amboss Rails Revolutionizes Lightning Network Passive Income","BitcoinWorld Unlock Bitcoin Yield: Amboss Rails Revolutionizes Lightning Network Passive Income Are you holding Bitcoin and looking for ways to make it work for you beyond just price appreciation? The world of cryptocurrency is constantly evolving, and finding opportunities for Bitcoin Yield is becoming increasingly sought after. Traditionally, earning yield on crypto often involved lending platforms that required you to give up custody of your assets. But what if you could earn yield while keeping your Bitcoin safe and sound in your own wallet? That’s where a new development on the Lightning Network is making waves. What is Amboss Rails and How Does it Offer Bitcoin Yield? Amboss, a well-known name in the Lightning Network ecosystem for analytics and node management, has launched a service called Rails. This innovative platform is designed to allow users to earn Bitcoin Yield directly on the Lightning Network. Unlike some other yield-generating methods, Rails operates on a self-custodial basis, meaning you retain control of your private keys and your Bitcoin throughout the process. Rails achieves this by facilitating two primary activities on the Lightning Network: Payment Routing: By running a Lightning node connected to Rails, users can earn small fees by routing payments across the network. When someone sends a Lightning payment, it travels through a series of nodes. Your node can earn a small fraction of the transaction fee for participating in the route. Liquidity Leasing: The Lightning Network relies on ‘channels’ filled with liquidity (Bitcoin) to route payments. Rails allows users to lease out their channel liquidity to other nodes or businesses that need it. In return for providing this crucial liquidity, users can earn yield. This dual approach leverages the fundamental mechanics of the Lightning Network to create earning opportunities directly tied to network activity and infrastructure needs. Boosting Lightning Network Activity Through Amboss Rails One of the key goals behind Amboss Rails is not just to offer users a way to generate Passive Bitcoin Income , but also to significantly boost the overall health and liquidity of the Lightning Network itself. A more liquid network is a more efficient and reliable network for payments. Think of it like a road network. The more well-maintained roads with sufficient capacity there are, the smoother traffic flows. Similarly, the more liquidity available in Lightning channels, the easier and more reliable it is for users to send and receive payments quickly and cheaply. By incentivizing users to provide liquidity and run well-connected nodes through yield generation, Rails directly contributes to making the Lightning Network a more robust and attractive platform for everyday transactions. This could play a crucial role in driving wider adoption of Bitcoin for payments. Who Can Benefit from Amboss Rails and Crypto Earning? Amboss Rails is designed with a variety of users in mind, particularly those who are serious about participating in and benefiting from the growth of the Lightning Network . The platform is targeting both institutions and businesses, recognizing their potential to contribute significant liquidity and benefit from reliable Crypto Earning opportunities. Early partners like CoinCorner, a prominent Bitcoin exchange, and Flux, a decentralized infrastructure provider, are already integrating with Rails. This indicates interest from established players in leveraging the service for their operations and potentially offering it to their users. While the service is sophisticated and likely requires some technical understanding to set up and manage a Lightning node effectively, the concept of earning Passive Bitcoin Income without handing over custody is appealing to a broad range of Bitcoin holders, from individuals with larger holdings to companies looking to optimize their treasury assets. Understanding the Mechanics: Payment Routing and Liquidity Leasing To truly grasp how Amboss Rails enables Bitcoin Yield , let’s look a bit closer at the two core mechanisms: Payment Routing: When a Lightning payment is initiated, the network finds a path of connected nodes with open channels and sufficient balance to route the payment. Nodes along the path earn a small fee (routing fee) for forwarding the payment. The amount earned depends on the volume of payments routed and the fees the node charges (which can be adjusted). Liquidity Leasing: Nodes or businesses needing more capacity in their channels to send or receive larger payments can ‘lease’ liquidity. Through Rails, users can offer their channel capacity for lease. The leasing terms (duration, yield rate) are agreed upon, and the provider earns yield for the period the liquidity is locked in the leased channel. Both methods are integral to the functioning of the Lightning Network and provide legitimate ways to earn a return based on providing essential network services. Challenges and Considerations for Earning Passive Bitcoin Income While the prospect of generating Passive Bitcoin Income through Amboss Rails is exciting, it’s important to be aware of potential challenges and considerations: Technical Complexity: Running a reliable Lightning node and managing channels effectively requires technical knowledge. Users need to understand channel management, balancing, and maintaining uptime. Variable Yield: The amount of Bitcoin Yield earned through routing fees can fluctuate significantly based on network activity and payment volume. Liquidity leasing might offer more predictable returns but depends on demand for liquidity. Capital Requirements: Earning meaningful yield typically requires dedicating a reasonable amount of Bitcoin to channels for routing and leasing. Channel Management: Actively managing channels, opening and closing them strategically, and ensuring they are well-connected is crucial for maximizing earning potential. Rails aims to simplify some aspects of this, particularly on the leasing side, but users should still approach it with a clear understanding of how the Lightning Network operates. The Future of Bitcoin Yield and the Lightning Network Amboss Rails represents a significant step forward in making Bitcoin Yield accessible on the Lightning Network in a self-custodial manner. By creating incentives for users to provide essential network services like routing and liquidity, it not only offers earning potential but also directly contributes to the network’s growth and efficiency. As the Lightning Network continues to mature and adoption increases, services like Rails could become increasingly popular, providing a virtuous cycle where earning opportunities grow alongside network usage. This could solidify the Lightning Network’s position as the premier layer-2 solution for fast, cheap Bitcoin transactions. For anyone interested in earning yield on their Bitcoin while supporting decentralized network infrastructure, exploring Amboss Rails and understanding the mechanics of Crypto Earning on the Lightning Network is a compelling prospect. Summary: Amboss Rails Opens New Doors for Bitcoin Earning In conclusion, Amboss has launched Rails, a self-custodial service enabling users to earn Bitcoin Yield on the Lightning Network . Through payment routing and liquidity leasing, Rails offers a novel way to generate Passive Bitcoin Income while maintaining control of your assets. Targeting businesses and institutions initially, with partners like CoinCorner and Flux on board, the platform aims to boost Lightning Network liquidity and adoption. While requiring some technical engagement, it presents a significant opportunity for those looking to participate in the network’s growth and benefit from Crypto Earning directly on layer 2.

The Fed, however, noted in a statement following the meeting that Powell did not discuss interest rate expectations with the president. “At the President’s invitation, Chair Powell met with the President today at the White House to discuss economic developments including for growth, employment, and inflation. Chair Powell did not discuss his expectations for monetary policy, except to stress that the path of policy will depend entirely on incoming economic information and what that means for the outlook. Finally, Chair Powell said that he and his colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will set monetary policy, as required by law, to support maximum employment and stable prices and will make those decisions based solely on careful, objective, and non-political analysis.” Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell for not slashing interest rates, saying earlier this month that communicating with the Fed chair is “like talking to a wall.” “The Bank of England cut. China cut. Everybody’s cutting but him. I don’t know, we’ll see what happens. It’s a shame. I call him ‘Too Late.’ Too Late Powell, that’s his nickname.

On Wednesday, the United States Court of International Trade (CIT) ruled that many of Donald Trump’s tariffs exceed the authority granted to the president by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The federal court struck down Trump’s April 2nd executive order establishing tariffs against 57 countries worldwide and several follow-up executive orders modifying the duties’ rates and start dates. The CIT also axed a slew of earlier tariffs Trump had applied to Mexico, Canada and China, which he claimed were retaliation for failing to stop the flood of illegal narcotics into the US. The Trump Administration immediately appealed the CIT’s ruling and requested a stay on the judgment, which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit granted . White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt blasted the CIT’s ruling on Thursday, arguing that Trump’s “sensitive diplomatic and trade negotiations” were being “derailed by activist judges.” Equities largely tracked sideways throughout the legal drama, with the S&P 500 ticking up 0.4% on Thursday and the Nasdaq Composite jumping by 0.39%.

French football powerhouse Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) has reportedly made a groundbreaking move, establishing a PSG Bitcoin Reserve . This development, initially reported by BeInCrypto, positions the Ligue 1 champions at the forefront of integrating cryptocurrency into traditional institutional finance within the sports sector. While many sports teams and leagues have dipped their toes into the crypto space through fan tokens, sponsorships, or NFTs, PSG’s reported decision to hold Bitcoin directly on its balance sheet is a distinct and potentially transformative step. It signals a level of confidence in Bitcoin as a store of value and a strategic asset. What Exactly is a Sports Team Bitcoin Reserve? In traditional finance, companies and institutions often hold reserves in various assets, primarily fiat currency, but also potentially in gold, real estate, or other stable investments, to manage liquidity, hedge against inflation, or diversify their holdings. A Sports Team Bitcoin reserve means the club is choosing to allocate a portion of its treasury funds directly into Bitcoin. This differs significantly from other crypto activities we’ve seen in sports: Fan Tokens: These are cryptocurrencies specifically for fans, offering voting rights, rewards, and access to exclusive content. They are primarily a fan engagement and revenue-generating tool, not a treasury management strategy. Sponsorships: Crypto exchanges or projects sponsoring teams provides marketing for the crypto entity and revenue for the team, but the team doesn’t necessarily hold the sponsored cryptocurrency. NFTs: Non-fungible tokens representing digital collectibles are another revenue stream and fan engagement method, not a direct investment in a core cryptocurrency like Bitcoin for treasury purposes. By establishing a PSG Bitcoin Reserve , the club is making an investment decision about its own corporate treasury, similar to how some major corporations have started holding Bitcoin. Why Would a Football Club Embrace Institutional Bitcoin Adoption? PSG’s move into holding Institutional Bitcoin is likely driven by several strategic considerations: 1. Inflation Hedge: Like many corporations exploring Bitcoin, PSG may view BTC as a potential hedge against inflation and the devaluation of traditional fiat currencies. Holding a scarce digital asset could preserve purchasing power over the long term. 2. Asset Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to their treasury diversifies their holdings beyond traditional financial instruments, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk (though introducing crypto-specific volatility). 3. Innovation and Brand Image: Aligning with cutting-edge technology like Bitcoin can enhance PSG’s brand image as innovative and forward-thinking. This resonates with a younger, globally connected, and tech-savvy fanbase. 4. Potential for Appreciation: While volatile, Bitcoin has shown significant long-term appreciation potential. A successful investment could directly benefit the club’s financial health. 5. Attracting a Global Digital Audience: Embracing Bitcoin connects PSG with the vast and growing global cryptocurrency community, potentially attracting new fans and commercial opportunities in digital markets. This step into Institutional Bitcoin by a major football club is a powerful signal to the market and other traditional institutions. Is PSG Truly the First Crypto Sports Pioneer in This Way? The claim that PSG is the first sports organization to introduce a Bitcoin reserve needs careful consideration. While many sports entities are involved with crypto, holding Bitcoin directly on the balance sheet for treasury purposes is indeed less common than fan tokens or sponsorships. Major corporations like MicroStrategy and Tesla famously added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, pioneering the ‘corporate treasury’ use case. PSG appears to be the first major professional sports *team* to publicly announce such a move specifically for Bitcoin reserves. Other sports entities might have exposure to crypto through investments in blockchain companies or receiving payments in crypto, but a dedicated ‘Bitcoin reserve’ signals a deliberate strategy to hold BTC as a primary treasury asset. This distinction is crucial and positions PSG as a notable pioneer in the intersection of Crypto Sports and corporate finance. Benefits and Challenges of a Football Club Crypto Strategy Adopting a Football Club Crypto strategy, particularly one involving holding volatile assets like Bitcoin, comes with potential rewards and significant risks. Potential Benefits: Financial Upside: If Bitcoin appreciates, the value of the reserve increases, boosting the club’s assets. Enhanced Reputation: Seen as innovative and aligned with future technology trends. New Revenue Streams: Opens doors for crypto-related partnerships and fan engagement initiatives. Global Reach: Connects with the worldwide crypto community. Potential Challenges and Risks: Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can fluctuate dramatically, potentially leading to significant paper losses on the reserve. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Security Risks: Holding significant amounts of crypto requires robust security measures against hacking and theft. Public Perception: Fluctuations in the reserve’s value could attract negative media attention or fan scrutiny. Accounting Complexity: Accounting for cryptocurrency holdings can be complex under current standards. Any Football Club Crypto strategy involving treasury reserves requires careful risk management and a long-term perspective. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Sports ? PSG’s reported move could be a watershed moment for Crypto Sports integration. If successful, it could inspire other major sports clubs and organizations across football, basketball, baseball, and other leagues to explore similar strategies. We might see a trend where: More teams consider holding Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as part of their treasury management. Crypto assets become more integrated into sports finance beyond just marketing and fan engagement. Competition increases among teams to be seen as technologically advanced and appealing to the digital generation. New financial products and services emerge specifically for sports organizations dealing with crypto. This development underscores the increasing convergence of the traditional financial world, institutional investment, and the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market, now reaching into the mainstream world of global sports. Actionable Insights for Fans and Investors For fans, this news highlights PSG’s commitment to innovation and potentially offers new ways to engage with the club in the future, perhaps through crypto-enabled platforms or services tied to the club’s digital strategy. For crypto investors, PSG’s move is another data point indicating growing institutional adoption of Bitcoin. While one team’s investment is not a guarantee of future price movements, it adds to the narrative of Bitcoin gaining acceptance as a legitimate asset class among diverse institutions. It’s a reminder that the integration of crypto into mainstream sectors is accelerating, creating both opportunities and the need for continued education and careful consideration of risks. A Bold Step into the Digital Future Paris Saint-Germain’s reported establishment of a PSG Bitcoin Reserve marks a bold and significant step. As potentially the first major sports team to directly hold Bitcoin as a treasury asset, they are navigating uncharted territory within the sports industry. This move reflects a growing confidence in Bitcoin among institutions and signals a potential shift in how major sports organizations manage their finances and engage with the digital economy. While challenges exist, the potential benefits in terms of diversification, inflation hedging, and brand innovation are clear. The world will be watching to see if other clubs follow PSG’s lead, further solidifying the link between Crypto Sports and the future of finance.

2025-05-30T06:50:19.000Z,"Urgent Showdown: Trump Pushes Fed Interest Rates Down, Powell Defends Independence","BitcoinWorld Urgent Showdown: Trump Pushes Fed Interest Rates Down, Powell Defends Independence For anyone navigating the dynamic world of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies, understanding the pulse of global economic policy is absolutely crucial. Why? Because decisions made in boardrooms like the Federal Reserve can send ripples that significantly influence the volatility and direction of the crypto market impact . A recent meeting between former President Donald Trump and current Fed Chair Jerome Powell brought this connection into sharp focus, highlighting the ongoing tension between political desires and central bank autonomy regarding Fed interest rates . The Meeting: Trump’s Call vs. Powell’s Stance on Fed Interest Rates On May 29, U.S. President Donald Trump met with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell . The core of Trump’s message was clear: he urged the Fed to cut Fed interest rates . His rationale, as reported by Yonhap News Agency, centered on the need for the U.S. to remain globally competitive. Lower interest rates can potentially weaken a nation’s currency, making its exports cheaper and potentially stimulating economic activity. However, Chair Powell’s response was equally firm. He reiterated the Federal Reserve’s long-standing commitment to making decisions based purely on economic data and without political influence. This principle of Fed independence is considered vital for maintaining stability and credibility in monetary policy. The Fed’s dual mandate is typically focused on maximizing employment and stabilizing prices (controlling inflation), not necessarily global competitiveness based on currency strength. Understanding Monetary Policy and Why it Matters to Crypto At its heart, monetary policy refers to the actions undertaken by a central bank, like the U.S. Federal Reserve, to manipulate the money supply and credit conditions to stimulate or constrain economic activity. The primary tool for this is often setting a target range for the federal funds rate – the interest rate banks charge each other for overnight lending. This rate influences borrowing costs throughout the economy, from mortgages and car loans to business investments. Here’s a simple breakdown of how monetary policy typically works and its potential effects: Lowering Interest Rates: This makes borrowing cheaper. Businesses might invest more, consumers might spend more (e.g., on homes or cars). This stimulates economic growth but can also lead to inflation if the economy overheats. It can also make traditional, low-yield investments less attractive. Raising Interest Rates: This makes borrowing more expensive. Businesses and consumers may reduce spending and investment. This slows down economic growth, helping to cool inflation. It can make traditional, safer investments (like bonds or savings accounts) more appealing due to higher yields. So, where does crypto fit in? Cryptocurrencies are often considered risk assets. When traditional investment yields are low (due to low interest rates), investors might look for higher returns in alternative markets, including crypto. Conversely, when interest rates rise, safer investments offer better returns, potentially drawing capital away from more speculative assets like Bitcoin and altcoins. This is the core of the crypto market impact from Fed decisions. The Current Stance: Holding Rates Despite Pressure Despite the pressure from Donald Trump and others who advocate for lower borrowing costs, the Federal Reserve under Jerome Powell has maintained a steady course. Since the start of Trump’s second term (assuming this refers to a hypothetical second term scenario or perhaps reflects a general sentiment during his presidency/post-presidency), the Fed has held rates within a specific range. The snippet mentions 4.25–4.50%, which aligns with rate levels seen in recent years as the Fed has worked to combat inflation that surged after the pandemic. This decision to hold rates reflects the Fed’s assessment of current economic conditions, particularly regarding inflation and employment. They are using data to guide their path, prioritizing price stability even in the face of political commentary or calls for growth stimulation via cheaper money. How Does This Tension Affect the Crypto Market? The dynamic between political pressure and Fed independence creates uncertainty, which the crypto market often reacts to. Here’s how this tension, specifically around Fed interest rates and monetary policy , can influence crypto: Uncertainty Breeds Volatility: Any hint of a shift in Fed policy, whether influenced by politics or data, can lead to significant price swings in crypto. Traders and investors constantly try to anticipate the Fed’s next move. Risk-On vs. Risk-Off Sentiment: If markets perceive that political pressure might lead to lower rates (more stimulative monetary policy ), it can foster a ‘risk-on’ environment where investors are more willing to buy assets like crypto. Conversely, if the Fed remains hawkish (focused on fighting inflation with higher rates), it supports a ‘risk-off’ sentiment, potentially leading to outflows from crypto. Dollar Strength: Higher U.S. interest rates typically strengthen the U.S. dollar, as foreign investors are attracted to higher yields on dollar-denominated assets. A stronger dollar can sometimes correlate with weaker performance in global commodities and potentially alternative assets like crypto, though this relationship is complex and not always direct. Inflation Hedges: Some view Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation. If expansionary monetary policy (like significant rate cuts or money printing) is anticipated, the narrative around Bitcoin as a hedge against currency debasement can gain traction, potentially boosting its price. The fact that Donald Trump is vocal about his preference for lower rates keeps the possibility of political influence on the table, even if Jerome Powell consistently pushes back. This ongoing dialogue contributes to the complex set of factors influencing investor sentiment and, consequently, the crypto market impact . What Are the Challenges and Actionable Insights for Crypto Holders? The primary challenge for crypto investors stemming from this situation is navigating the uncertainty. Predicting the Fed’s exact moves is difficult, and predicting the extent to which political pressure might *eventually* have an effect is even harder. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Pay close attention to official Federal Reserve announcements, meeting minutes, and speeches by Chair Powell and other governors. These provide direct insight into their data-driven approach and future intentions. Monitor Economic Data: Keep an eye on key economic indicators the Fed watches, such as inflation rates (CPI, PCE), employment figures (non-farm payrolls, unemployment rate), and GDP growth. These data points are what truly drive the Fed’s decisions, according to Powell. Understand the Correlation, But Don’t Assume Causation: While there’s a historical correlation between interest rates/monetary policy and crypto market movements, it’s not the only factor. Regulatory news, technological developments, institutional adoption, and global events also play significant roles. Develop a Long-Term Strategy: Relying solely on predicting Fed moves for short-term trading is risky. A well-researched, long-term investment strategy based on the fundamentals of the crypto projects you believe in is often more robust against macro-economic volatility. Consider Diversification: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversifying across different asset classes can help mitigate risks associated with specific market sensitivities, like crypto’s reaction to monetary policy shifts. In Summary: The Ongoing Tug-of-War The meeting between Donald Trump and Jerome Powell serves as a potent reminder of the inherent tension between political goals and the independent mandate of the central bank. While a president may advocate for policies they believe will benefit the economy (like lower Fed interest rates for global competitiveness), the Federal Reserve maintains that its decisions are based on rigorous data analysis aimed at achieving stable prices and maximum employment. This ongoing dialogue, and the market’s reaction to the perceived likelihood of rate changes influenced by either data or pressure, has a tangible crypto market impact . For those invested in digital assets, understanding this complex interplay of monetary policy , political commentary, and economic data is not just academic – it’s a vital part of navigating the market landscape effectively.

2025-05-30T06:40:48.000Z,"FTX Collapse: Netflix Unveils Shocking Series on SBF Scandal","BitcoinWorld FTX Collapse: Netflix Unveils Shocking Series on SBF Scandal Get ready to dive deep into one of the most talked-about events in recent financial history. Netflix, the streaming giant known for bringing complex stories to the screen, is tackling the FTX collapse . That’s right, the dramatic downfall of Sam Bankman-Fried’s cryptocurrency exchange is set to become an eight-part series, promising to peel back the layers on the events that sent shockwaves through the crypto world and beyond. What is the Netflix FTX Series “The Altruists”? According to reports, Netflix is developing an eight-part series focusing on the dramatic implosion of FTX. The working title for the series is reportedly “The Altruists.” This title itself hints at the complex and often contradictory public image cultivated by FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who frequently spoke about effective altruism while allegedly orchestrating massive financial misconduct. The series aims to chronicle the story of FTX, its meteoric rise, and its stunning collapse in November 2022. It will likely place a significant focus on the key figures involved, particularly: Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF): The founder and former CEO of FTX, known for his distinctive look, media presence, and political donations. Caroline Ellison: The former CEO of Alameda Research, FTX’s affiliated trading firm, whose testimony played a crucial role in subsequent legal proceedings. The series is being produced by Higher Ground, the production company founded by former U.S. President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama. This involvement suggests a focus on the broader societal and ethical implications of the collapse, not just the financial details. It indicates the series aims for a wide audience, explaining the complexities of crypto and the scandal in an accessible way. The choice of an eight-part format suggests a comprehensive approach, allowing the series to explore different facets of the story, from the early days of FTX and Alameda to the frantic days leading up to the bankruptcy filing and the aftermath. Deep Dive: The Devastating FTX Collapse The FTX collapse wasn’t just a company going bankrupt; it was a spectacular implosion that wiped out billions in customer funds and severely damaged trust in the cryptocurrency industry. Understanding the context is crucial for appreciating the significance of the Netflix series. FTX, at its peak, was one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, valued at an estimated $32 billion. Sam Bankman-Fried was hailed as a crypto prodigy, a responsible figure bringing legitimacy to the volatile world of digital assets. However, underneath the polished exterior, serious issues were allegedly brewing, primarily involving the relationship between FTX and Alameda Research. Here’s a simplified look at some key aspects the series will likely explore: The Intertwined Relationship: Alameda Research, also founded by SBF, was a hedge fund. Allegations center on Alameda receiving preferential treatment on FTX, including a massive, effectively unlimited line of credit, allowing it to trade with customer funds deposited on the exchange. Misuse of Customer Funds: Prosecutors alleged that billions of dollars in customer funds deposited on FTX were secretly diverted to Alameda to cover its trading losses, make investments, and fund lavish lifestyles and political donations. The Bank Run: The crisis escalated rapidly in early November 2022 following reports raising concerns about Alameda’s balance sheet and its reliance on FTX’s native token, FTT. This triggered a massive wave of customer withdrawals from FTX that the exchange could not fulfill, exposing the lack of reserves. Bankruptcy: Within days, FTX, Alameda, and dozens of affiliated companies filed for bankruptcy in the U.S., leaving millions of customers unable to access their funds. The speed and scale of the collapse were unprecedented for such a major financial institution, leaving regulators, investors, and the public stunned. It highlighted significant risks within the crypto ecosystem, particularly concerning transparency, corporate governance, and the commingling of funds. Key Players: Sam Bankman-Fried and Caroline Ellison At the heart of the FTX scandal are Sam Bankman-Fried and Caroline Ellison. Their relationship, both personal and professional, is central to the narrative. Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF): SBF cultivated an image as a quirky, ethical billionaire, often seen in shorts and a t-shirt, promoting effective altruism and responsible crypto regulation. He testified before Congress and became a prominent voice in the industry. However, prosecutors painted a different picture: that of a calculating individual who defrauded customers and investors on a massive scale. His trial captivated the public, culminating in his conviction on multiple counts of fraud and conspiracy. Caroline Ellison: Ellison was the CEO of Alameda Research. Her role is particularly significant because she was privy to the inner workings of Alameda’s finances and its relationship with FTX. After the collapse, she pleaded guilty to fraud charges and became a key cooperating witness for the government in the case against SBF. Her candid testimony provided crucial insights into the alleged fraudulent activities and the decision-making processes within the two companies. The dynamic between these two figures, their shared history at Jane Street, their cohabitation in the Bahamas, and their differing roles in the alleged scheme, offer fertile ground for dramatic storytelling. The Netflix series will likely explore their motivations, their decisions, and the pressures they faced as their financial empire crumbled. Why a Series on the FTX Scandal Matters Why dedicate an eight-part series to the FTX scandal ? Because it’s more than just a business failure; it’s a story packed with universal themes: Ambition and Hubris: The rapid rise and fall of SBF and FTX exemplify the dangers of unchecked ambition and overconfidence. Ethics and Deception: The core allegations involve a massive betrayal of trust and a stark contrast between public image and private actions. The Complexity of Finance: The series can help demystify some aspects of cryptocurrency and complex financial structures for a general audience, illustrating the risks involved. Regulatory Challenges: The collapse highlighted the urgent need for clearer regulation in the crypto space, a topic of ongoing global debate. Human Impact: Millions of individuals lost significant savings in the collapse. The series has the potential to tell these human stories. For those interested in crypto, finance, or simply compelling narratives of power and downfall, the FTX story is a modern cautionary tale. A high-profile series like this can bring mainstream attention to the risks and complexities of the digital asset world, potentially educating viewers about the importance of due diligence and regulatory oversight. Beyond the Headlines: What Other Crypto Documentaries Should You Watch? While we await the Netflix FTX series , there are other valuable crypto documentaries and series that explore different facets of this fascinating and volatile industry. If you’re hooked on understanding the world of digital assets, consider checking out: Here are a few examples: Title Focus Potential Themes Covered Banking on Bitcoin The origins and early days of Bitcoin and the technology behind it. Creation of Bitcoin, early adopters, blockchain tech, ideological roots. Crypto A fictional thriller touching on the dark side of cryptocurrency money laundering. Crime, regulation, anonymity vs. transparency. (Note: Fictional) Line Goes Up – The Problem With NFTs A critical look at the NFT market. NFTs, digital art, speculation, environmental impact, scams. Trust No One: The Hunt for the Crypto King Focuses on the QuadrigaCX exchange collapse and the mysterious death of its founder. Exchange risks, founder control, security, investigation. These examples cover a range of topics, from the foundational technology to market phenomena and other cautionary tales. The FTX series will add another critical piece to this growing body of content attempting to make sense of the crypto revolution. Anticipating “The Altruists” The announcement of the Netflix series “The Altruists” is a significant moment. It signals that the story of the FTX collapse has transcended the financial news cycle and entered the realm of major cultural narratives. With Higher Ground producing, there’s an expectation of a thoughtful and engaging exploration of the events, the individuals involved, and the broader implications. For many, the series will be a chance to understand how such a massive alleged fraud could occur in plain sight. For those affected by the collapse, it might be a difficult but necessary recounting of events. And for the crypto industry, it serves as a stark reminder of the need for transparency, robust regulation, and ethical leadership. As production moves forward, more details about the cast, specific focus areas, and release date will emerge. But one thing is clear: the story of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, and Caroline Ellison is coming to a major streaming platform, ensuring that this pivotal moment in financial history will be examined by a global audience. The Netflix FTX series isn’t just entertainment; it’s a potential educational tool and a historical document chronicling a defining event for the digital asset world. Conclusion: The Curtain Rises on the FTX Saga The news that Netflix is producing an eight-part series titled “The Altruists” on the FTX collapse confirms the immense impact and enduring fascination surrounding this event. Focusing on figures like Sam Bankman-Fried and Caroline Ellison, and produced by Higher Ground, the series is poised to offer a comprehensive look at the rise and spectacular fall of a crypto empire. It will likely explore the complex interplay of ambition, innovation, alleged deception, and the human cost of one of the largest financial frauds in history. For anyone trying to understand the volatile world of cryptocurrency, the challenges of regulation, or simply drawn to compelling stories of power and downfall, this series promises to be essential viewing.

2025-05-30T06:30:05.000Z,"This Chart Warns Bitcoin’s Momentum May Be Running Out, Here’s Why","Bitcoin is currently trading above $107,000 following a recent peak that saw the asset touch a new all-time high above $111,000. Although this marks a 3.9% drop from its highest level, the broader monthly trend remains positive, with BTC still recording a gain of over 10% in the last 30 days. The market, however, has shifted its attention from price movement to on-chain dynamics, particularly the behavior of new and long-term holders. Related Reading: Bitcoin Surges With Low Retail Interest – Is A Second Wave Coming? Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Selling, New Entrants Still Cautious On-chain analyst Avocado Onchain, writing on CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, examined Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) data to assess investor trends during this stage of the cycle. In a post titled “UTXO Age Band Analysis: Sluggish Inflow of New Investors May Limit Bitcoin’s Upside,” he explored whether BTC’s continued rally can be sustained without fresh capital inflows from newer market participants. His findings suggest that while older coins are being sold, the inflow of newer investors remains low, a factor that has historically limited momentum in previous cycles. The UTXO age distribution reveals that a significant portion of the BTC supply remains with holders who have kept their assets for over six months. The 6–12 month age band has increased, suggesting a large share of market participants still fall into the mid- to long-term holding category. Historically, when the proportion of these holders started to shrink, it often preceded major tops in Bitcoin’s price cycle, driven by a transition of coins from long-term to new investors. However, despite Bitcoin reaching new highs, the percentage of UTXOs held by investors with a holding period of less than one month remains well below the historical threshold seen near previous market tops. During earlier bull cycles, new investor participation often surged past 50%. Currently, that figure sits around 20%, even lower than the peak levels during this recent rally. Avocado Onchain warns that without a notable increase in participation from newer investors, the market may struggle to maintain upward momentum. Large Holders Accumulate as Retail Stays on Sidelines While retail inflows appear to be lacking, large-scale accumulation is continuing in the background. A recent update from CryptoQuant on X highlighted that Bitcoin addresses holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC, excluding exchanges and miners, have been steadily increasing.

2025-05-30T06:30:00.000Z,"Crypto market crash: is this the end of the bull run?","The crypto market has pulled back in the past few days. After soaring to a record high of $111,900 last week, Bitcoin price fell to $106,000 as investors booked profits. Bullish liquidations have risen, and demand for most altcoins has fallen. This article explains why the crash has happened and whether this is the end of the bull run. Why the crypto market crash has happened The crypto market crash has happened because of profit-taking among investors. Besides, Bitcoin price was up by 50% from its lowest level in April to its highest swing this month. It is common for Bitcoin and other assets to pull back after rising to a crucial resistance level. There are many examples about this. For example, BTC price jumped to a record high of $64,750 in April 2021 and then dived to $28,685 in June 2021. It then soared to a new all-time high of $69,255 in November 2021 and to below $20,000 in 2022. Most recently, Bitcoin peaked at $73,783 in March last year and then dropped below $50,000 in August. These pullbacks normally happens as investors book profits and prepare for the next big move. Technically, the crypto market crash is happening as Bitcoin forms the handle section of the cup-and-handle pattern. C&H is a pattern comprised of a rounded bottom, a horizontal support, and a shoulder. The shoulder can happen for a few days or months, and it often results into a strong bullish breakout. Altcoins are falling because of their close correlation with Bitcoin. When Bitcoin sneezes, the rest of the crypto market catches a cold. In most cases, if Bitcoin falls by 1%, many altcoins will fall by over 5%. Bitcoin price cup and handle pattern | Source: TradingView Trade concerns and the Fed The crypto market crash has also happened as concerns about trade and the Federal Reserve have remained. A US court ended Donald Trump’s tariffs this week, but another one left them in place for the time being. These tariffs will remain in place until the case concludes at the Supreme Court. Also, it is worth noting that Trump has other ways to implement tariffs even if the current ones fail. The crypto market crash happened after Scott Bessent said that China talks had stalled , and that it would now take a meeting between Xi Jinping and Donald Trump to resolve the deadlock. There are also concerns that the Federal Reserve will maintain high interest rates for longer as inflation concerns remain. Is the crypto bull run over? Therefore, a common question among most participants in the crypto market is whether the bull market is now over. We believe that the crypto bull run is still going on because of Bitcoin’s supply and demand dynamics. Bitcoin demand continues rising, with spot ETFs having cumulative inflows of over $45 billion. At the same time, Bitcoin supply in exchanges has dropped from over 3 million in 2020 to 1.3 million today. The rest of the Bitcoins are held in cold wallets. Also, as mentioned above, Bitcoin has formed a cup-and-handle pattern, meaning that it will soon have a bullish breakout. If this happens, there is a likelihood that other altcoins will rebound. The caveat is that the ongoing price action could stay for a while as we enter the summer months. Historically, June is usually Bitcoin’s worst month.

The FTX’s long-awaited creditor repayment program seems to have kept the traders on edge. A $5 billion stablecoin payout could be good news for those who were waiting to recover the funds, but the market could be more focused on where the money could go While the stablecoin flows in and out of the exchange have dropped as the exchange reserves deplete, the top tokens like Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Cardano seem to have been facing some potential selling pressure. Once the recipients receive their portion, the stablecoin reserves on CEX are expected to increase, which could flood the market, increasing the trading activity within the space. Now the question arises, will Bitcoin or Ethereum benefit from this move? After marking new highs during the past week, the Bitcoin price has initiated the weekly trade on a bearish note. The token is on the verge of losing below the pivotal support zone, while Ethereum displays strength as it sustains firmly above $2600, maintaining consecutive higher highs and lows. Besides, XRP & ADA continue to trade below the descending trend line, while memecoins are plunging with a double-digit margin. The payout is one of the largest in crypto history, as the creditors are set to receive funds after 18 months of the exchange’s collapse. Hence, this is expected to hit the exchanges first, which could increase the stablecoin exchange reserve. While some may exit the space, some are believed to get swapped for the other cryptos, Bitcoin being one of the popular choices. Hence, Bitcoin is expected to receive some liquidity that may push the price slightly higher. With this, the other cryptos could also experience a similar price rise that could help the markets remain under bullish influence.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/massive-liquidity-set-to-enter-crypto-markets-for-the-first-time-ever-will-this-benefit-bitcoins-price/,"BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

In January 2024, the crypto OTC infrastructure firm Finery Markets reported that institutional OTC volumes jumped 106% last year.Cointelegraph approached Hidden Road for comment regarding the estimated OTC volumes globally and in the US, but had not received a response by the time of publication.Rising institutional demandIn December 2024, Higgins highlighted a rising demand for institutional balance sheets from large institutions in an interview with Finance Magnates.“Servicing them [institutional investors] across traditional finance and digital asset ecosystems that have already converged presents a really unique opportunity for us in the marketplace.”Hidden Road’s OTC swap launch in the US marks one of the first products launched by the firm since the company entered a definitive agreement to be acquired by Ripple.Related: Taurus, Parfin partnership to provide crypto infrastructure to institutionsSoon after the deal was announced, Hidden Road received a broker-dealer license from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, a private US corporation and self-regulatory organization regulating member brokerage firms and exchange markets.Hidden Road is also known as one of the first companies to receive a Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) license in Europe, immediately after the framework entered into full force on Dec. 30, 2024.

2025-05-29T13:30:00.000Z,"How African innovators are using blockchain to solve real problems","While blockchain headlines in the West often focus on speculation and regulation, in Africa, it’s a different story, one rooted in necessity, innovation and grassroots adoption. The latest episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast explores this ground-up revolution with Kevin Imani, head of StarkWare’s Africa Venture Studio, who shares how communities across the continent are using blockchain to tackle real-world problems in finance, energy and connectivity.A student movement“Young students were using blockchain before it was mainstream,” Imani explained. From Kenya to Nigeria, local needs, not hype, drove early adoption. In many cases, it was students receiving digital currencies from abroad or freelancers getting paid in dollars and struggling to convert funds into local currency. With limited banking infrastructure or trust in government institutions, decentralized alternatives offered a lifeline.Imani highlighted how centralized systems like Kenya’s E-Mpesa changed access to finance, but still fall short for international payments or off-ramping digital assets. Related: Blockchain.com expands in Africa as local crypto rules take shape“You have to start becoming a trader almost,” he said, describing the convoluted process of converting stablecoins or crypto earnings into usable local funds. This trust gap has fueled peer-to-peer crypto usage. “These were kids holding stablecoins not to spend them, but to store value.” Even before regulators or startups built formal infrastructure, communities had already found use cases for blockchain.Blockchain beyond finance Beyond finance, African innovators are tapping blockchain to address energy insecurity. In rural Zambia, excess power from a mini hydro station could go to waste. Instead, residents can now use that surplus to mine Bitcoin, for example, generating revenue and creating a sustainable power loop. “It’s self-sustaining and reduces waste,” Imani said.Connectivity is another frontier. In areas where traditional internet providers fall short, decentralized WiFi hotspot networks are emerging. With blockchain, community members can share bandwidth and be compensated instantly and transparently. “You don’t need a middleman. It’s fair and trackable,” he said.Still, mainstream adoption remains cautious. Governments like those in Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa are in “standby mode,” focused more on consumer protection than full-scale implementation. But Imani remains optimistic: “The need is there. The technology is here. The only question is how we bridge that gap.”To hear the full conversation on The Clear Crypto Podcast, listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, a barometer of investor sentiment, stands at a notable score of 74, hinting at prevailing “greed” in the market.Crypto Fear & Greed Index. Source: Alternative.meNotably, this index is above 50 after staying below the midlevel between February and April. Sustaining this index in the “greed” zone since May 6 strongly indicates the positive sentiment the market players have for the wider crypto market.This pattern in market sentiment has been a precursor to price rallies in the past and could be an indicator of an upcoming bull run. Interestingly, the index is significantly lower than 82 in March 2024 and 94 in December 2024, marking the local tops. This suggests that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index could still rise into the “extreme greed” zone beyond 85, possibly pushing Bitcoin price toward new highs. Related: Bitcoin price will reach $130K or even $1.5M, top bulls sayBitcoin’s OI remains high post-ATHsOpen interest (OI) for Bitcoin futures contracts has seen marked growth since the sub-$74,000 local low in April, expanding to a record high of $80.5 billion on May 23 from $50.8 billion on April 8, according to CoinGlass data.The IO is currently at $78.4 billion, reflecting a $27.6 billion or a 54% increase over the last 50 days alone, suggesting a buildup of leverage ​​often accompanying bullish environments.Bitcoin futures aggregate open interest, USD.

Still, while Berners-Lee was not personally responsible for DNS development, he could have opted for a URL structure not tied to the DNS we know today, or he could have pushed for a decentralized alternative. Source: Mely.ethRelated: Decentralized naming could bring ‘next billion’ users to BitcoinCentralization of the DNSThe DNS system is highly centralized, particularly at its top levels of hierarchy. The root zone, which governs top-level domains such as .com and .org, is managed by the US-based nonprofit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).Furthermore, the most authoritative servers are operated by a handful of organizations, further centralizing the system. This allows for easy censorship and control by governments that can unilaterally seize or block domain names.This degree of centralization also makes outages due to centralized service disruption more likely. Control over root zones and domain policies is also concentrated in a few regions and among a select group of stakeholders.There are also concerns regarding privacy because centralized DNS queries can be monitored, logged and intercepted by internet service providers and other intermediaries.Related: Community split on ENS petition against Unstoppable Domains patentCrypto’s solution to the problemDecentralized alternatives to the DNS system are being developed. The most well-known is the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), which maps human-readable names to Ethereum addresses, content on the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS), or other data.Another alternative is Unstoppable Domains. Its system mints domains as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Ethereum and Polygon.ENS has seen a fair share of adoption. In late 2024, ENS Labs also partnered with PayPal and Venmo, sparking speculation about how this partnership is likely to boost mainstream adoption.IPFS runs on Ethereum smart contracts and aims to be user-owned and censorship-resistant. Currently, it is primarily used in Web3 applications, wallets and decentralized websites.Another alternative is Handshake (HNS), which aims to be a decentralized and permissionless naming protocol that is compatible with traditional DNS. A project with a similar aim is Namecoin (NMC), an early Bitcoin fork designed specifically to offer .bit domains and store DNS records onchain with censorship resistance.IPFS is also accompanied by its own Inter-Planetary Name System (IPNS), which enables mutable naming for IPFS addresses (hashes). URLs generated this way point to specific content, not servers.A non-crypto alternative to DNS is OpenNIC. This is a user-run project that offers non-ICANN domains, aiming to decentralize control through community governance.Magazine: Move to Portugal to become a crypto digital nomad — Everybody else is",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/tim-berners-lee-says-dns-should-have-been-more-decentralized?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Ethereum Foundation turns to DeFi for cash","The Ethereum Foundation (EF) has borrowed $2 million in GHO, a decentralized stablecoin developed by Aave, in a move signaling deeper engagement with decentralized finance (DeFi) strategies.  In a May 29 X post, Aave founder Stani Kulechov said the foundation borrowed $2 million in GHO tokens. “The EF is not only supplying ETH to Aave, but also borrowing from Aave,” Kulechov wrote, describing the development as “the full DeFi circle.”GHO is a decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin native to the Aave Protocol. Unlike centralized stablecoins, GHO is governed by Aave’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which oversees interest rates, collateral requirements and facilitator selection. The move highlights the EF’s growing engagement with the DeFi ecosystem, moving toward more sophisticated treasury strategies. The foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Source: Stani KulechovEthereum Foundation previously deployed $120 million in DeFiThe foundation’s move to borrow GHO follows a previous $120 million deployment into various protocols, signaling a shift in how it manages its crypto holdings. In February, the EF deployed 45,000 Ether (ETH) across different DeFi protocols, including Aave, Spark and Compound. At the time, the Ether was worth $120 million. Kulechov previously described the fund deployment as the foundation’s “biggest allocation in DeFi.” Because of the move, the Aave founder said that DeFi will win, expressing optimism as the EF added liquidity to the protocol.Apart from Kulechov, community members also celebrated the move, supporting the EF’s ETH holdings management shift. A community member said the development was a win, saying the foundation should “keep it up,” while an X user said it would be positive if the EF continued to use their funds this way. Related: Ethereum Foundation unveils security initiative to supplant legacy systemsCriticisms of the foundation selling Ether In January, Ethereum community members called on the foundation to explore alternatives to selling ETH for operational funding. The community suggested DeFi tools like staking and borrowing stablecoins against ETH. Eric Conner, co-author of EIP-1559, criticized the ETH selling, saying that the foundation’s primary use case seemed to be dumping its holdings. He called the practice “insane,” urging the EF to stake or use DeFi instead of selling. Anthony Sassano, host of The Daily Gwei, proposed that the EF stake part of its ETH and sell the staking rewards.

Mainstream browsers will also integrate agentic capabilities or build interoperability with purpose-built agentic browsers as AI becomes cheaper, according to Zhu.However, the most significant adoption will come within the next decade when onchain and offchain environments will be completely merged for internet users, Zhu said, adding:“Agentic browsers are poised to become the default entry point — much like smartphones replaced feature phones.”In the long term, Donut aims to support payments, gaming, content creation and social interaction, all within a single crypto-native browser. The company also plans to leverage advancements in decentralized identity and confidential computing to turn the browser into a personal “crypto CFO” for retail users.

SOL/ETH weekly price chart. Source: TradingViewFor SOL/ETH, this projects a downside target for July, near 0.038 ETH, representing a 40% decline from current levels.The 50-week exponential moving average (50-week EMA; the red wave) around 0.0628 ETH is offering interim support. A decisive weekly close below this level would likely confirm the bearish continuation toward the 0.038 ETH target.A bounce, on the other hand, could have SOL reclaim the wedge’s lower trendline as support, which may delay the breakdown scenario. Breaking above the wedge’s upper trendline will likely invalidate the 40% crash setup altogether.Cooling memecoin frenzy hints at SOL/ETH crashThe breakdown in SOL/ETH aligns with a visible decline in memecoin-driven activity on Solana. A key indicator is Pump.fun, the largest memecoin launch platform on the network, which shows a sharp drop in daily fee revenue since early April.

If accurate, the findings suggest that Arkham has mapped out most of the company’s stash, making it the first entity to publicly associate the wallets with the firm. “Saylor said he would never reveal his addresses. So, we did,” Arkham wrote, adding that the amount represents 87.5% of the total Bitcoin holdings of Strategy. Cointelegraph reached out to Arkham and Strategy for comment but had not received a response by publication time.  Source: Arkham IntelligenceStrategy chairman says publishing addresses “not a good idea” Arkam’s claims follow comments from Saylor about the risks of publishing wallet addresses. At the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Saylor said that publishing wallet addresses is dangerous for companies holding Bitcoin. “No institutional grade or enterprise security analyst would think it’s a good idea to publish all of the wallet addresses such that you can be traced back and forth,” Saylor said. The executive said making wallets public allows every future transaction to be scrutinized, exposing a company to risks that may not be immediately apparent. To highlight his point, Saylor suggested using artificial intelligence to explore the issue. Saylor said if a user puts AI in deep think mode and asks about security problems associated with publishing wallet addresses, the executive said the response could get “50 pages” of security problems.Related: Metaplanet issues $21M in bonds to buy Bitcoin, a day after $50M raiseArkham previously accused of mislabelling walletsWhile blockchain data is publicly available, the accuracy of claims related to wallet ownership has been questioned before. At the height of the Mantra token collapse, Mantra CEO John Mullin denied accusations of insiders dumping their token.
