2025-05-30T19:55:48.000Z,"Here’s How Low Bitcoin Could Fall in the Worst-Case Scenario, According to One Widely-Followed Crypto Trader","A closely followed crypto analyst is laying out Bitcoin’s worst-case scenario while also showing how BTC could shoot up to a new all-time high. In a new thread, pseudonymous crypto analyst Pentoshi tells his 865,000 followers on the social media platform X that the top crypto asset by market cap could dip to a price in the mid-$90,000s if it were to lose support around the $101,000 to $102,000 area. However, according to the analyst, demand for the flagship digital asset will be greater than all the BTC mined from all points, which in turn should eventually lead to a price spike. “We are still making higher highs and higher lows, overall this is a strong uptrend… [In my opinion], the worst case scenario [if] the trend [were] to continue [is] we see mid $90,000s as the next higher low. That’s IF we lose around $101,000-$102,000 area, which is the current support. I don’t really think you can compare this currently to 2021 because the situation isn’t the same at all, we were going into a period then of [quantitative tightening] after a period of extreme excess. The competition currently for BTC is only growing, and I’m quite certain the demand is greater than the daily mined BTC from all data points. So demand > supply over any period of time. I think the biggest enemy of people is their own patience. I too make these mistakes [from] time to time.” Source: Ali Pentoshi/X The trader’s chart indicates that BTC could dip to his target sometime between June and July before sparking a rally to the $120,000 range. BTC is trading for $105,471 at time of writing, a 1.5% decrease during the last 24 hours.

2025-05-30T19:50:54.000Z,"Bitcoin Mining: Cango’s Remarkable Growth Adds 109.1 BTC","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Mining: Cango’s Remarkable Growth Adds 109.1 BTC In the ever-evolving landscape where traditional industries intersect with the cutting edge of digital finance, news from unexpected corners often makes the biggest splash. This week, Cango Inc., a company primarily known as a leading automotive transaction service platform in China, turned heads in the cryptocurrency world with a significant announcement regarding its Bitcoin mining operations. What’s Behind Cango’s Jump into Bitcoin Mining? Cango’s foray into the world of digital asset mining might seem surprising at first glance for a company rooted in the automotive sector. However, it reflects a growing trend among diverse corporations looking to diversify their assets, explore new revenue streams, and potentially hedge against macroeconomic uncertainties. By acquiring Bitcoin (BTC) mining machines, reportedly from industry giant Bitmain, Cango is actively participating in the process that secures the Bitcoin network and generates new BTC. Bitcoin mining involves using powerful computers to solve complex mathematical problems. The first miner to solve the problem gets to add the next block of transactions to the Bitcoin blockchain and is rewarded with newly minted Bitcoin and transaction fees. This process requires significant computational power and energy, making it a capital-intensive operation. For a company like Cango, investing in mining infrastructure represents a strategic decision to directly accumulate a digital asset that many believe has long-term value potential. A Closer Look at Cango’s Growing Cango BTC Holdings The core of the recent announcement from Cango, shared via their official channels, was the impressive figure of 109.1 BTC mined within a single week. This is a substantial amount of Bitcoin, reflecting efficient operations and significant deployed hashing power. But perhaps more importantly, this weekly yield has significantly boosted their total reserves. Following this successful week of mining, Cango’s total Cango BTC holdings have now reached an impressive 3,398 BTC. To put this into perspective, let’s consider the approximate value (keeping in mind that cryptocurrency prices are highly volatile and this value fluctuates constantly). As of the time of writing, 3,398 BTC represents a multi-million dollar asset on their balance sheet. This positions Cango as a notable corporate holder of Bitcoin, although still considerably smaller than giants like MicroStrategy, whose strategy is primarily focused on accumulating BTC. The growth in their holdings demonstrates that their investment in mining equipment is yielding tangible results, steadily increasing their digital asset reserves over time. This isn’t just a speculative purchase; it’s an active accumulation strategy through operational activity. Why Are More Companies Embracing Corporate Bitcoin Strategies? Cango is not alone in exploring the potential of digital assets. The trend of companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets, often referred to as adopting a corporate Bitcoin strategy, gained significant momentum starting in 2020. Companies cite various reasons for this move: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin is often viewed as a potential hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies due to its capped supply. Asset Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset like Bitcoin can help diversify a company’s treasury reserves away from traditional cash and bonds. Potential for Appreciation: Companies anticipate that the value of Bitcoin will increase over the long term. Attracting Talent and Investor Interest: Embracing innovative technologies like Bitcoin can make a company appear forward-thinking. New Revenue Streams: For companies like Cango, mining directly generates new assets and potentially revenue. While holding Bitcoin is one approach, actively engaging in crypto mining , as Cango is doing, represents a deeper operational commitment to the ecosystem. It requires expertise in setting up and managing mining infrastructure, navigating energy costs, and dealing with the technical complexities involved. Navigating the World of Crypto Mining: Challenges and Considerations While the rewards of successful crypto mining , such as accumulating 109.1 BTC in a week, are attractive, the process comes with significant challenges: High Capital Costs: Acquiring powerful mining hardware, like the machines from Bitmain, requires a substantial upfront investment. Energy Consumption and Cost: Mining is energy-intensive. The cost and availability of electricity are major factors influencing profitability and operational location. Mining Difficulty: As more miners join the network, the difficulty of solving the mathematical problems increases, requiring more powerful hardware to maintain the same level of output. Hardware Obsolescence: Mining technology evolves rapidly, meaning hardware can become less efficient or obsolete over time. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrency mining varies significantly across jurisdictions and can change unexpectedly, posing risks, especially for companies operating in complex regions like China. Bitcoin Price Volatility: The value of the mined Bitcoin fluctuates with market prices, impacting the profitability of the operation. Cango’s continued success in mining suggests they are effectively managing these challenges, leveraging their resources and strategic partnerships (like with Bitmain) to build a productive mining operation alongside their primary automotive business. Cango’s Announcement in the Context of Recent Bitcoin News This positive development from Cango comes at a time when the broader Bitcoin news cycle is often dominated by market price movements, regulatory discussions, and the performance of dedicated crypto companies. Cango’s update serves as a reminder that adoption and participation in the Bitcoin network are expanding beyond traditional crypto-native firms. It highlights that companies from diverse sectors are finding strategic reasons to engage with Bitcoin, either through direct investment or operational activities like mining. This kind of organic accumulation by publicly traded companies adds another layer to the institutional adoption narrative surrounding Bitcoin. Benefits of Cango’s Mining Strategy: Direct accumulation of a potentially appreciating asset. Diversification of company assets. Potential new revenue stream from mining rewards and transaction fees. Operational involvement provides deeper understanding of the crypto ecosystem. Challenges Cango Faces: Significant capital expenditure on hardware. Ongoing operational costs, primarily energy. Risk associated with Bitcoin price volatility. Navigating the complex and evolving regulatory landscape for crypto mining. Maintaining competitive edge against dedicated mining companies. Actionable Insights from Cango’s Move What can individuals and other businesses take away from Cango’s successful mining venture? Diversification is Key: Companies are exploring non-traditional assets for balance sheet management. Operational Adoption is Growing: It’s not just about buying Bitcoin; some companies are integrating crypto into their operations. Mining Requires Expertise: Successful mining involves careful planning, significant investment, and efficient management of technical and energy resources. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on companies from traditional sectors entering the crypto space, as it signals broader acceptance and potential future trends. Cango’s ability to successfully mine over 100 BTC in a week and build their holdings to over 3,000 BTC demonstrates that with the right strategy and resources, companies from various industries can effectively participate in the digital asset economy. Conclusion: Cango’s Mining Success Signals Broader Trends Cango’s announcement that it mined 109.1 BTC this week, bringing its total Cango BTC holdings to 3,398 BTC, is more than just a number; it’s a testament to the increasing integration of corporate Bitcoin strategies into the operations of diverse companies. While their primary business remains automotive services, their significant investment in Bitcoin mining infrastructure, supplied by Bitmain, is clearly paying off, allowing them to accumulate a substantial digital asset reserve. This move highlights the growing interest from non-crypto native companies in leveraging digital assets for strategic purposes, whether for balance sheet management, diversification, or exploring new revenue streams through activities like crypto mining . As the world of finance and technology continues to converge, expect to see more such stories emerge, further solidifying Bitcoin’s place in the global corporate landscape. Cango’s remarkable growth in its BTC holdings is a notable piece of recent Bitcoin news , underscoring the dynamic evolution of corporate engagement with cryptocurrencies.

As Bitcoin (BTC) price dropped below $105k, the wider altcoin market led by the memecoins recorded heavy forced liquidation of long-leveraged traders. According to market data from Coinglass, more than $747 million in forced crypto liquidations involved long traders. The forced liquidations of Bitcoin’s whale-long traders, led by James Wynn , triggered further short-term pessimism. Meanwhile, the short crypto traders recorded around $80 million in forced liquidations during the past 24 hours. As a result, the odds of a long squeeze escalated despite the overall optimism of a market rebound over the weekend. What Next for the Altcoin Market The optimism of a crypto rebound in the coming few days remains evident amid the ongoing bloodbath. Bitcoin’s fear and greed index hovered around 60 percent, signaling greed among crypto traders. The improving crypto regulatory frameworks in major jurisdictions, led by the United States, has attracted more institutional investors in the web3 space. As a result, it is evident that more crypto investors are anticipating a bullish rebound in the coming days, potentially a parabolic rally in the near future. However, the ongoing bearish sentiment may likely delay a bullish rebound, especially if Bitcoin price drops below $100k again in the coming days. Nonetheless, the notable surge of bearish traders will likely trigger a major short squeeze of Bitcoin price rebounds above $110k in the coming days. The crypto bullish outlook has a higher ground catalyzed by rising adoption from institutional investors and favoring regulatory frameworks from major jurisdictions.

Altcoins have moved in the opposite direction, dealing a harsh blow to bullish investors hoping for an imminent “altseason.” A recent analysis on CryptoQuant highlights the contrast in liquidation patterns between BTC and altcoins since the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, offering a glimpse into the diverging paths taken by the two market segments. Short liquidations on Bitcoin have far exceeded long liquidations since the ETF approval, according to the report. Short liquidations on Bitcoin have far exceeded long liquidations since the ETF approval. Source: @joao_wedson Bitcoin’s post-ETF rally crushes the bears On Binance, Bitcoin’s Cumulative Liquidation Delta (CLD) showed that short liquidations on Bitcoin exceeded long liquidations by far since the SEC approved ETFs in early 2024. In essence, traders who bet against Bitcoin since then have been systematically forced out of their positions as BTC steadily climbed. In a post on X , analyst Joao Wedson, the author of the CryptoQuant report, stated, “The data doesn’t lie: since the ETF launch, there has been $190 million more in short liquidations than long liquidations on Binance.” According to Wedson, Bitcoin’s price strength during this period caught many bearish speculators off guard. Rather than correcting or stalling after the ETF launches, BTC has extended its rally, reinforcing its dominance and trust among institutional and retail investors alike. Altcoins have become a trap for bulls Unlike Bitcoin, the story is starkly different for the altcoin market. While Bitcoin has steadily climbed and squeezed shorts, altcoins have suffered from overwhelming long liquidations. According to CryptoQuant’s data, long liquidations in the altcoin market outpaced short liquidations by nearly $1 billion during the same post-ETF period. Long liquidations in the altcoin market outpace short liquidations by nearly $1 billion since Bitcoin spot ETFs launched. Source: @joao_wedson This imbalance suggests that many traders expected altcoins to follow Bitcoin’s bullish lead, perhaps anticipating the onset of a long-awaited “altseason”—a period in which altcoins outperform BTC. Unfortunately for these traders, altcoin prices largely trended downward, defying the bullish bias and resulting in widespread liquidations of leveraged long positions. Market dynamics reveal a diverging risk appetite This stark difference in liquidation patterns reveals more than just market volatility; it suggests a fundamental shift in trader sentiment and risk behavior. While investors showed correct bullish conviction in Bitcoin, they incorrectly assumed altcoins would follow suit. The result? BTC punished the bears, but altcoins punished their bulls even harder. The divergence also reflects institutional interest. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have attracted billions in capital from traditional finance players, buoyed by strong macroeconomic narratives, adding legitimacy and demand to BTC. Altcoins, however, lack similar instruments and regulatory clarity, leaving them more vulnerable to retail speculation and volatility. For traders and analysts, the message is clear, and it’s that the current crypto environment favors Bitcoin in terms of relative stability and upside potential.

2025-05-30T19:30:59.000Z,"Bitcoin Price: Exciting Potential Before Major Profit Taking Begins","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price: Exciting Potential Before Major Profit Taking Begins Are you wondering about the future trajectory of the Bitcoin price ? In the dynamic world of the crypto market , understanding potential turning points is key. While Bitcoin has seen significant gains, recent on-chain analysis using the MVRV metric suggests there might be more room to run before we see widespread profit taking . Understanding the Power of On-Chain Analysis for Bitcoin Price Before diving into the specifics of the MVRV metric , it’s essential to grasp the value of on-chain analysis . Unlike traditional market analysis that focuses on price charts and trading volume, on-chain analysis examines transactions occurring directly on the blockchain. This provides unique insights into the behavior of market participants, including miners, long-term holders, and short-term speculators. Think of it as looking under the hood of the Bitcoin network. You can see where coins are moving, how long they’ve been held, and even estimate the average cost basis of different groups of investors. This transparency is a powerful tool for understanding underlying market dynamics that might not be immediately obvious from price charts alone. Key benefits of using on-chain analysis : Provides insight into genuine user activity and adoption. Helps identify accumulation or distribution phases. Offers clues about the conviction of long-term holders. Can signal potential market tops or bottoms based on historical patterns. While no single metric is a crystal ball, combining on-chain data with other forms of analysis can provide a more comprehensive view of the crypto market . Decoding the MVRV Metric: Market Value vs. Realized Value The MVRV metric , or Market Value to Realized Value ratio, is a cornerstone of on-chain analysis developed by Murad Mahmudov and David Puell. It compares the current market capitalization (Market Value) of Bitcoin to its Realized Capitalization (Realized Value). Market Value (MV): This is the standard market cap – the current Bitcoin price multiplied by the circulating supply. It represents the total value of Bitcoin as perceived by the market right now. Realized Value (RV): This is a modified market cap where each Bitcoin is valued not at the current price, but at the price it was last moved on the blockchain. It approximates the average cost basis of all Bitcoin in existence. It tends to be less volatile than Market Value. The MVRV metric is calculated as: MV / RV. The resulting ratio indicates whether the market value is above or below the aggregate cost basis of investors. Interpreting the MVRV Ratio: MVRV > 1: The Market Value is greater than the Realized Value. On average, holders are in profit. The higher the ratio, the greater the aggregate unrealized profit in the system. MVRV The Market Value is less than the Realized Value. On average, holders are at a loss. Historically, values below 1 have signaled potential market bottoms. By observing the MVRV ratio over time, analysts can identify periods where the market is potentially overextended (high MVRV) or undervalued (low MVRV). Glassnode’s Insights: Current MVRV and Profit Taking Potential Leading on-chain analysis firm Glassnode recently shared crucial data regarding the current position of the Bitcoin price relative to the MVRV metric . According to their report, Bitcoin is presently trading within a specific range defined by standard deviations above the mean MVRV. The key takeaway is that Bitcoin is currently positioned between +0.5σ and +1σ on the MVRV chart. Historically, this range has often coincided with periods signaling short-term peaks or local tops within a larger trend. However, the critical piece of information is that this level has not yet reached the typical threshold that historically triggers significant, widespread profit taking across the network. What does this imply? It suggests that while some short-term traders might be taking profits, the majority of the market, particularly long-term holders, have not yet reached a point where they feel compelled to sell en masse. This conviction among holders provides underlying support and indicates that upward price movement is still feasible before the market enters a phase dominated by heavy selling pressure aimed at realizing gains. The current position suggests a market that is profitable for many, but not yet exhibiting the extreme levels of euphoria and overvaluation that have marked previous cycle tops where significant profit taking occurred. Comparing Current MVRV to Historical Profit Taking Zones To truly appreciate the significance of Glassnode’s findings, it helps to look at historical context. When did significant profit taking typically kick in during previous bull markets, according to the MVRV metric ? Historically, major market tops and subsequent large-scale profit taking have correlated with MVRV ratios reaching much higher standard deviation levels, typically above +2σ, and sometimes even exceeding +3σ or +4σ in parabolic phases. Consider these examples: 2017 Peak: The MVRV ratio reached levels well above +3σ, signaling extreme overvaluation and preceding a significant market correction driven by intense selling. 2021 Peaks (April & November): While not reaching the same extreme as 2017, both peaks saw the MVRV ratio climb above +2σ, indicating significant unrealized profits and leading to substantial price pullbacks as investors cashed out. Comparing these historical levels to the current +0.5σ to +1σ range highlighted by Glassnode clearly illustrates the difference. The market isn’t exhibiting the same degree of aggregate unrealized profit that historically precipitates major reversals driven by profit taking . This historical comparison is a key reason why analysts suggest there is still ‘room to run’ for the Bitcoin price . What This Means for the Crypto Market: Potential Room for Growth The implication of the MVRV analysis is positive for the short-to-medium term outlook for the Bitcoin price . If the market hasn’t reached the typical zone for major profit taking , it suggests that the current upward trend could continue. This doesn’t mean the price will go up in a straight line, or that corrections won’t happen. The crypto market is known for its volatility. However, it indicates that a major, cycle-ending top driven by overwhelming investor desire to cash out gains might not be imminent based on this specific on-chain analysis tool. Potential scenarios suggested by this data: Continued Upward Trend: The price continues to climb as long-term holders remain convicted and new demand enters the market, pushing the MVRV ratio higher towards historical peak zones. Consolidation: The price might consolidate or experience minor pullbacks within the current MVRV range as some short-term holders take profits, but without triggering a major downtrend. Eventual Peak: The market will eventually reach an MVRV level (historically above +2σ) that signals significant overvaluation, leading to increased profit taking and a potential market top. The current MVRV position suggests we are likely still in the earlier to middle stages of a bull market cycle, rather than the final, euphoric blow-off top phase. Actionable Insights for Investors Navigating the Crypto Market For those participating in the crypto market , this on-chain analysis provides valuable context. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Continue monitoring on-chain analysis metrics like MVRV, but also look at other indicators and broader market news. Manage Expectations: While the analysis suggests potential upside, remember that market dynamics can change rapidly. Avoid making decisions based solely on one metric. Plan Your Strategy: If you hold Bitcoin, consider what MVRV levels or price points might align with your own investment goals for profit taking , but be aware that historical patterns are not guarantees. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): For those accumulating, DCA remains a sound strategy to navigate volatility regardless of specific metric signals. Risk Management: Always invest only what you can afford to lose and understand the risks inherent in the crypto market . The insight that major profit taking hasn’t begun provides a degree of confidence, but it should empower informed decision-making, not reckless speculation. Challenges and Limitations of Relying on the MVRV Metric While the MVRV metric is a powerful tool for on-chain analysis , it’s crucial to acknowledge its limitations: Historical Data: The metric is based on historical patterns. The current market cycle might behave differently due to new factors like increased institutional adoption, macroeconomic conditions, or regulatory changes. Approximation: Realized Value is an approximation of cost basis. Not every coin movement represents a trade (e.g., internal wallet transfers). Single Metric: Relying on MVRV alone is insufficient. A holistic view requires considering other on-chain indicators (SOPR, NUPL, etc.), technical analysis, and fundamental factors. Interpretation: Different analysts might interpret the same MVRV levels slightly differently based on context. Therefore, use MVRV as a valuable piece of the puzzle, not the entire picture when assessing the potential future of the Bitcoin price and the broader crypto market . Conclusion: Room to Run Before the Peak? In summary, the recent on-chain analysis from Glassnode focusing on the MVRV metric provides a compelling perspective on the current state of the Bitcoin price . While trading in a range that has historically signaled short-term peaks, the metric has not yet reached the elevated levels that typically precede widespread, significant profit taking . This suggests that the crypto market , led by Bitcoin, potentially has more room for upward movement before the aggregate unrealized profit becomes so substantial that it triggers a major sell-off phase. Understanding metrics like MVRV, combined with historical context, empowers investors to make more informed decisions in this exciting yet volatile asset class. While caution is always warranted, the current data point from on-chain analysis offers a hopeful outlook for continued growth before the ultimate cycle peak driven by major profit taking pressure.

Bitcoin is seen as an inflation hedge, while Ethereum's on-chain ecosystem ties it to market liquidity and tech trends. Technologically, Bitcoin and Ethereum differ in purpose, consensus, and architecture, each reflecting a distinct vision. Several key factors influence the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum, including market demand, technological upgrades, and investor sentiment. Explore the key differences of bitcoin and Ethereum in our comprehensive guide. Understand the underlying technology, and how each fits within the market space. Bitcoin vs Ethereum: Understanding the Key Differences and Similarities In the rapidly evolving world of digital finance, two names consistently stand out: Bitcoin and Ethereum. These blockchain-based giants are not just cryptocurrencies; they represent the forefront of a financial evolution. Over the years, both have grown from niche experiments into major assets influencing global markets. While Bitcoin and Ethereum share the common ground of being blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, their differences are significant. Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, was created as a decentralized digital currency and potential store of value. Meanwhile, Ethereum is a programmable platform that enables smart contracts and decentralized applications (Dapps) to be built and operated without downtime, fraud, or interference. Bitcoin: Often compared to digital gold, it is designed primarily for secure value transfer and storage. Ethereum: A decentralized software platform powering an ecosystem of applications beyond currency, from finance to gaming – via smart contracts. Both assets have matured significantly, capturing headlines and investor interest worldwide. Below, we explore their origins, technical makeup, market performance, use cases, and what the future may hold for each. The Growing Interest in Bitcoin and Ethereum Bitcoin and Ethereum's rising popularity signals more than a trend; it marks crypto's deeper integration into mainstream finance. Often referred to as digital gold, Bitcoin appeals to retail and institutional investors as a potential store of value. Ethereum's smart contracts expand blockchain's role into areas like DeFi, gaming, and decentralized governance. By 2024, interest surged further. Major financial firms began offering crypto products, and U.S. regulators approved the first Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs, fueling institutional inflows. The growing overlap between Wall Street and crypto highlights how digital assets have moved from the margins to the financial mainstream. Digital Market Dynamics: Bitcoin and Ethereum Bitcoin and Ethereum have reshaped digital markets, advancing crypto adoption for investment and innovation. Bitcoin's decentralized design and recognition make it a key entry point into digital assets. Ethereum powers Web3, a blockchain-based internet layer that enables decentralized apps in finance, social media, and gaming. Macroeconomic forces now heavily influence both assets. Bitcoin is seen as an inflation hedge, while Ethereum's on-chain ecosystem ties it to market liquidity and tech trends. They're discussed not just in crypto circles but in central bank briefings and institutional portfolios. Differing Philosophies and Technological Underpinnings The philosophical and technological foundations of Bitcoin and Ethereum differ significantly. Bitcoin emphasizes decentralization, security, and digital scarcity, serving as a ledger for peer-to-peer value transfer. Ethereum expands on this by enabling programmable contracts and a decentralized world computer. Consensus Mechanism: Bitcoin uses Proof-of-Work (PoW), where miners secure the network through computational energy, prioritizing security, but with high energy costs. Ethereum shifted to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) in 2022's \""Merge,\"" where validators stake Ether, cutting energy use by over 99% and boosting scalability. The two networks reflect divergent paths: Bitcoin reinforcing PoW's reliability and Ethereum optimizing for sustainability. Economic Model: Bitcoin enforces a hard cap of 21 million BTC, supporting its store-of-value status, most recently reinforced by the 2024 halving. Ethereum has no fixed cap; it issues Ether to validators but burns fees (via EIP-1559), allowing for dynamic supply and occasional deflation. Bitcoin follows strict scarcity; Ethereum opts for flexible utility. Use and Functionality: Bitcoin is built for secure, straightforward transactions, with limited scripting to ensure reliability and minimal risk. Ethereum's Turing-complete platform enables complex applications from DeFi to digital collectibles—bitcoin champions censorship-resistant money and Ethereum censorship-resistant applications. Despite these contrasts, both networks continue to evolve along their respective paths—Bitcoin as a secure monetary asset and Ethereum as a versatile innovation platform. Yet both remain grounded in decentralization and open development. The Genesis of Bitcoin and Ethereum The inception of Bitcoin and Ethereum marked significant milestones in the evolution of digital finance, introducing the world to the concepts of blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi). These technologies have since revolutionized how we perceive money, investment, and the internet's architecture, laying the groundwork for a more transparent, secure, and accessible financial system. Bitcoin Origins Bitcoin, introduced in a 2008 white paper by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto and launched in January 2009, solved the \""double-spending\"" problem without needing a central authority, enabling secure, peer-to-peer digital transactions via a decentralized blockchain. Initially embraced by cryptography enthusiasts and libertarians, Bitcoin demonstrated that a decentralized network could protect significant value. With a capped supply and energy-intensive creation process, it established itself as a scarce, censorship-resistant asset often compared to digital gold. Ethereum Origins Proposed by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and launched in 2015, Ethereum expanded blockchain's potential by introducing smart contracts, self-executing code that powers decentralized applications (DApps) beyond simple payments. Unlike Bitcoin's single-purpose design, Ethereum was built as a multipurpose platform, laying the groundwork for programmable money and Web3. Early use cases included DeFi, tokenized assets, and ICOs. Despite launching later, Ethereum quickly became central to the decentralized web, fueled by a dynamic developer community committed to ongoing innovation. Bitcoin vs Ethereum: A Technical Comparison Technologically, Bitcoin and Ethereum differ in purpose, consensus, and architecture, each reflecting a distinct vision. Below is a high-level comparison of key technical aspects. Consensus Mechanism: Bitcoin uses Proof of Work (PoW), where miners validate transactions by solving cryptographic puzzles. This method is highly secure but energy-intensive. Since 2022's Merge, Ethereum has used Proof of Stake (PoS), where validators stake Ether to propose blocks. PoS cuts energy use and improves scalability, aligning with Ethereum's sustainability goals. Block Time: Bitcoin produces a block every ~10 minutes, leading to slower transaction confirmations. Ethereum's PoS design allows blocks every ~12 seconds, enabling more transactions per minute. Both use scaling solutions like Bitcoin's Lightning Network and Ethereum's layer-2 rollups to increase throughput beyond the base layer. Smart Contracts and DApps: Bitcoin supports limited scripting, prioritizing security over programmability. With its Turing-complete environment and smart contract support (via Solidity and the EVM), Ethereum enables a wide range of DApps—from DeFi to NFTs. Bitcoin focuses on secure transfers; Ethereum enables programmable logic. Supply and Issuance: Bitcoin's supply is capped at 21 million, and mining rewards halve every four years, making it a disinflationary asset. Ethereum has no fixed cap, but since EIP-1559, part of each transaction fee is burned. ETH can become deflationary during high usage, balancing rewards with supply control. These technical differences reflect core philosophies: Bitcoin is stable and secure for digital money; Ethereum is adaptable and innovative for decentralized services. Both have driven blockchain's evolution in complementary ways. Key Bitcoin Features Bitcoin's architecture includes several core features that have fueled its success as the first decentralized digital currency. Blockchain Ledger: Bitcoin's blockchain is a decentralized ledger recording all transactions across a global network. Each block contains verified transactions added through a public, tamper-resistant process. This ensures security and independence from central authorities, reducing fraud and censorship risks. Mining Process: Bitcoin uses Proof of Work (PoW), where miners solve mathematical puzzles to validate transactions and secure the network. In return, they receive new bitcoins, introducing a predictable issuance schedule. Transaction Speed and Scalability: Bitcoin's base layer processes a block every ~10 minutes, handling 5–7 transactions per second. This limited throughput can lead to congestion and high fees. Upgrades like SegWit improved block efficiency, while the Lightning Network, a Layer-2 solution, enables instant, low-cost off-chain payments, which, by 2025, support microtransactions and advanced use cases. Ongoing Innovations: While cautious in its evolution, Bitcoin continues to advance. The 2021 Taproot upgrade enhanced privacy and flexibility through Schnorr signatures and Merkelized scripts. Projects like sidechains (Liquid, Rootstock) further expand Bitcoin's capabilities while maintaining its core value of minimizing trust. Key Ethereum Features Ethereum's architecture introduces key innovations that extend blockchain utility beyond simple transactions. Smart Contracts: Ethereum pioneered smart contracts, a self-executing code that automates agreements without intermediaries. A contract might release a loan when collateral is posted or reclaim it if terms aren't met. This logic powers decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, supply chains, and more, enabling transparent, autonomous applications. Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM): The EVM runs all smart contracts on Ethereum, acting as a global decentralized computer. Every node computes the same outcome for a given contract, ensuring consensus. Its developer-friendly design has made Ethereum the standard for decentralized app ( DAPP ) development, with many blockchains adopting EVM compatibility. Major Upgrades (The Merge and Beyond): Ethereum's 2022 transition to Proof of Stake (The Merge) slashed energy use and laid the groundwork for further scaling. Future upgrades aim to improve throughput and cost-efficiency while preserving Ethereum's programmability. Ecosystem and Token Standards: Ethereum's token standards; ERC-20 for fungible tokens and ERC-721 for NFTs, sparked major crypto trends like ICOs and digital collectibles. Ethereum hosts tokenized assets from stablecoins to securities, reinforcing its role as a flexible platform for digital value creation.

Bitcoin and Ethereum Core Differences Bitcoin and Ethereum's technological frameworks and future scalability plans highlight their unique positions and objectives within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The chart below highlights the core technical differences between the two cryptocurrencies: Feature Bitcoin Ethereum Creator(s) Satoshi Nakamoto Vitalik Buterin, Charles Hoskinson, Gavin Wood, Joseph Lubin, and Anthony Di Iorio Launch Date January 2009 July 2015 Currency vs. Platform A credible alternative to traditional fiat currencies (medium of exchange, potential store of value) A platform to run programmatic contracts and applications via Ether Consensus Algorithm Proof-of-Work (PoW) Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Block Time 10 minutes on average 12 seconds on average Transaction Throughput 7 transactions per second (TPS) 14 transactions per second (TPS) Supply Finite supply-capped at 21 million BTC Infinite supply Scalability Solutions SegWit, Lightning Network Ethereum 2.0, Sharding, Plasma Technological Frameworks Bitcoin is purpose-built for secure, decentralized value transfer. Its development is conservative, and changes like SegWit and Taproot are incremental and backward-compatible. Ethereum, by contrast, is a flexible platform designed to evolve. Originally PoW-based, it now runs on PoS and supports smart contracts, with ongoing upgrades proposed via EIPs. Bitcoin favors stability; Ethereum prioritizes adaptability. Scalability Approach Bitcoin scales via off-chain solutions like the Lightning Network, preserving its lean base layer and full-node accessibility. Ethereum uses both on-chain upgrades and Layer-2 solutions (e.g., Rollups), with sharding planned to expand base-layer capacity. Bitcoin's model keeps complexity low; Ethereum's boosts throughput with a more dynamic, modular architecture. Market Performance: Bitcoin Price vs Ethereum The market performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum provides a fascinating glimpse into the dynamics of cryptocurrency markets. Both have experienced significant price fluctuations over the years, shaped by various factors. Historical Price Trends Both Bitcoin and Ethereum saw notable volatility over the past year, but Bitcoin has clearly outperformed. Following the April 2024 halving, Bitcoin's price showed resilience, rising ~16% through March 2025, while Ethereum dropped ~50%. This changed in the past week as Ethereum rose over 50%. The halving and the launch of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETPs drew investor capital toward BTC and away from ETH. Ethereum has seen dramatic swings in recent months, while Bitcoin remained more stable. Part of this disparity stems from Bitcoin's singular role as a potential store of value, which appeals in uncertain markets. Ethereum, though critical to DeFi and smart contracts, has faced unique headwinds that continue to shape its outlook. Factors Influencing Price Several key factors influence the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum, including market demand, technological upgrades, and investor sentiment. Market Demand & Adoption: Bitcoin benefits from its reputation, gaining traction as a hedge against inflation and monetary instability, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty. Ethereum's demand is tied to its utility, with spikes in DeFi, NFTs, or broader blockchain use driving ETH usage and price. By 2025, rising global adoption from individuals to governments has contributed to the growing demand for both assets. Technological Upgrades & Innovations: Major protocol upgrades often influence prices. Bitcoin's halving events reduce new supply and have historically preceded bull runs. Technical improvements like SegWit or growing Lightning Network adoption also boost confidence. For Ethereum, milestones like The Merge and upcoming sharding plans increase scalability and reduce supply growth, often triggering positive sentiment. These upgrades enhance utility and signal progress, which can attract new investors. Investor Sentiment & Macro Trends: Sentiments, shaped by news, institutional moves, or macro events, have a strong short-term impact. ETP approvals, large corporate investments, or regulatory clarity can spark rallies. Conversely, hacks, restrictions, or economic fear can drive selloffs. Bitcoin often benefits from inflation concerns or distrust in fiat systems, while Ethereum gains when innovation in its ecosystem is strong. Bitcoin vs Ethereum Performance Source: Morningstar 2025.

Practical Uses: From Everyday Transactions to Smart Contracts Bitcoin and Ethereum differ in primary use cases, shaped by their core design philosophies. Bitcoin's Uses: Bitcoin functions as both digital money and a store of value. It's used for cross-border payments and remittances and as an alternative currency in regions with unstable economies. With tools like the Lightning Network, Bitcoin now supports fast, low-cost micro-transactions. However, by 2025, its dominant role will be as a potential store of value, a hedge against inflation held by investors, companies, and even nation-states. Its finite supply and resilience have cemented its status as a macro asset and financial reserve in the crypto ecosystem. Ethereum's Uses: Ethereum powers a broad array of decentralized applications. It's the foundation of DeFi platforms (like Uniswap and Aave), NFT marketplaces, and DAOs that govern projects via token-based voting. Beyond finance and art, Ethereum supports blockchain gaming, social platforms, and supply chain tracking. It also hosts most stablecoins (like USDC), facilitating global, near-instant digital dollar transfers. In the future, institutions plan to use Ethereum to tokenize real-world assets like bonds and funds, reinforcing its role as a general-purpose platform for programmable value and ownership. Community and Developer Ecosystem: Bitcoin vs Ethereum Bitcoin and Ethereum have vibrant, open-source ecosystems fueled by developers, entrepreneurs, investors, and enthusiasts, though each reflects its culture and priorities. Bitcoin's Community & Ecosystem: Bitcoin's community is pragmatic and security-focused. Development through Bitcoin Core is slow and deliberate, with changes like SegWit, Taproot, and Lightning focused on scalability and privacy without compromising the base layer. A network of exchanges, miners, custodians, and nonprofits (like Brink) supports its infrastructure. The Lightning Network, in particular, has attracted a subcommunity building wallets, payments, and even smart contract-like functions. Sidechains like Liquid and RSK show that while conservative, Bitcoin's developers still explore expanded use cases in ways that preserve Bitcoin's core principles of decentralization and resilience. Ethereum's Community & Ecosystem: Ethereum's community is innovation-driven and collaborative. The Ethereum Foundation and EIPs steer development, but independent projects, hackathons, and DAOs power the broader ecosystem. Its vibrant application layer spans DeFi, NFTs, gaming, identity, and social networks. Layer-2 teams like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon are integral to scaling efforts, and enterprise alliances (e.g., the EEA) show growing corporate interest. Ethereum embraces experimentation, which drives rapid evolution, sometimes with challenges like congestion or high fees, but also continuous progress. Collaboration and Bridging Traditional Finance: Both networks engage with traditional finance. Bitcoin's partnerships (e.g., Lightning integrations with fintech apps) are making BTC usable in real-world payments. Ethereum sees institutions using its network or stablecoins for settlements and asset tokenization. These collaborations reflect growing adoption and ecosystem maturity. Bitcoin's community is laser-focused on secure, decentralized money, while Ethereum's community pushes the boundaries of decentralized applications. Together, they represent complementary pillars of blockchain's future—deeply supported by passionate, global communities. Investment Perspectives: Bitcoin and Ethereum From an investment standpoint, Bitcoin and Ethereum offer distinct but complementary value propositions that both institutional and retail investors increasingly recognize. Bitcoin is widely viewed as a potential store of value, prized for its scarcity, resilience, and independence from centralized monetary policy. Its appeal as a hedge against inflation and macro uncertainty has grown, especially post-2024 halving and with the rise of regulated Bitcoin ETPs. Bitcoin's relatively low correlation to traditional assets adds portfolio diversification benefits, though its volatility demands prudent risk management. Today, a range of institutions, hedge funds, pensions, and retail platforms have integrated Bitcoin into portfolios, further legitimizing it as a long-term, accessible investment. Ethereum is seen as a bet on the decentralized internet and financial innovation. Its value stems from being the core infrastructure for DeFi, NFTs, and tokenized assets. With Proof of Stake, ETH holders can now earn staking rewards (4–6% annually), adding an income dimension. Fee-burning (via EIP-1559) introduces deflationary potential, enhancing ETH's appeal as both a utility asset and a potential store of value. Institutional interest is growing, evidenced by Ether ETPs, though Ethereum carries more complexity and execution risk than Bitcoin. Bitcoin vs Ethereum: Long-Term Outlooks Predictions for Bitcoin and Ethereum over the next 5–10 years are generally optimistic, though they acknowledge risks and volatility. Both have defied skeptics, and their futures will be shaped by tech upgrades, regulatory developments, and global macro trends. Bitcoin: Bitcoin's long-term outlook is relatively straightforward. Post-2024 halving, its reduced issuance, and strong stock-to-flow dynamics appeal to long-term holders. Institutional adoption via ETPs and treasury allocations supports its narrative as digital sound money. With a slow-moving, conservative development path, Bitcoin avoids the execution risks that Ethereum faces. Its continued success largely depends on increased adoption as a hedge or reserve asset. Ethereum: Ethereum's future is more complex. It leads in decentralized applications but must execute a challenging roadmap (e.g., rollups, sharding) to sustain growth. While upgrades like the Merge and Shanghai laid the groundwork, the transition to a rollup-centric model raises concerns, particularly around fee capture and Layer-1 value retention. Some worry that Ethereum's base layer risks becoming a \""commodity backbone\"" as more activity shifts to Layer-2s. Competition and Fragmentation: Ethereum also faces rising competition from newer Layer-1s, which offer faster throughput and different trade-offs. These rivals have chipped away at Ethereum's dominance, sparking debates on economic realignment (e.g., L2 revenue sharing). At the same time, Ethereum continues to evolve: the Pectra upgrade and falling fees in early 2025 signal ongoing innovation. Bitcoin's simplicity and scarcity give it a steady, low-risk profile. Ethereum offers broader potential but carries greater uncertainty. Its success now hinges on delivering upgrades while preserving ecosystem cohesion and value capture, challenges that define its near-term narrative. Conclusion: Navigating the Bitcoin and Ethereum Landscape Bitcoin and Ethereum each offer distinct yet complementary roles in shaping digital finance's future. Bitcoin stands as a secure, decentralized potential store of value, while Ethereum powers a dynamic ecosystem of decentralized applications and digital ownership. As of May 2025, both have matured significantly - Bitcoin with growing institutional adoption and Ethereum through major protocol upgrades and expanding use cases. BTC and ETH present unique opportunities for investors. Rather than an either/or decision, many portfolios include both to balance risk and utility. Despite volatility and evolving regulations, staying informed, patient, and engaged with the space has historically benefited long-term believers. Together, Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to redefine global finance and technology, cementing their roles as foundational pillars of the blockchain era.

In a new press release , the FBI states that it’s seeking those affected by the pig butchering scheme, which typically involves scammers gaining the trust of victims over time to convince them to invest digital assets into fraudulent websites that they control. Once the victims invest, they are further tricked by lucrative returns on their investment before ultimately being locked out of their accounts and losing access to their funds. Earlier this week, FUNNULL – a Philippines-based computer infrastructure firm – was sanctioned by the US Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). According to authorities, FUNNULL purchases data such as IP addresses in bulk and sells them to criminals to host fraudulent investment websites and other malicious content. It was found that the firm could have sold data to up to hundreds of thousands of websites that run these types of scams. The Treasury Department said at the time that the majority of crypto scams reported to the FBI were linked to FUNNULL and that US-based victims lost about a combined $200 million to these types of schemes, or $150,000 per individual affected. Sanctions were also placed on FUNNULL’s administrator, Chinese national Liu Lizhi, who allegedly was in possession of documents that tracked data on the firm’s employees, including ranking them based on performance.

2025-05-30T18:30:38.000Z,"21Shares Files Amended S-1 For Dogecoin ETF Bid","Asset manager 21Shares has filed an amendment for its Dogecoin ETFs, which it filed last month. This development comes just weeks after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) acknowledged the filing , which kickstarted the review process. 21Shares Files Amended Dogecoin ETF Application A SEC filing shows that 21Shares has amended its application to offer a Dogecoin ETF. The asset manager had initially filed the S-1 form for this fund on April 9, a move that showed its intention to offer institutional investors direct exposure to the top meme coin. Meanwhile, Nasdaq had filed the 19b-4 form to list and trade shares of this ETF, which officially began the approval process. In an X post , Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas noted that the amended filing makes things more interesting, as these amendments typically follow comments made by the SEC. As such, it suggests that the Commission is in communication with the asset manager, a development which provides optimism about an approval at some point. It is worth mentioning that the SEC recently delayed its decision on Grayscale’s Dogecoin ETF application while seeking more comments and rebuttals on the filing. The next deadline for the Commission to decide on this application is August 19. The fourth and final deadline is on October 18. Bitwise has also filed to offer a Dogecoin ETF, but the SEC delayed its decision on this filing following the first deadline, which came up on the first of this month. The next deadline for this filing is June 15, when the Commission is also likely to delay the application. The third and fourth deadlines are on September 13 and November 12, respectively. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart predicts that approval is unlikely to come until the early part of the fourth quarter. Odds Of An Approval This Year Polymarket data shows that there is a 69% chance of the SEC approving a Dogecoin ETF by December 31. Meanwhile, there is only a 15% chance that an approval will come by July 31. Bloomberg analysts Seyffart and Balchunas have also weighed in on the odds of an approval for a DOGE ETF this year. Balchunas shared a chart that showed there is an 80% chance that a Dogecoin ETF could be approved this year. They reached these odds based on the assumption that the SEC views DOGE as a commodity, as well as the fact that there is a regulated futures market for the meme coin. A futures market increases the chances of an approval since the court ruled in the Grayscale case that the spot and futures markets are similar.

2025-05-30T18:20:08.000Z,"Champions League Finalist PSG Adopts Bitcoin for Treasury Reserves","French football giant Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) has scored a historic first: It has become the inaugural major sports club in the world to allocate Bitcoin (BTC) to its treasury reserves. The move, announced by Pär Helgosson, Head of PSG Labs and Web3, at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas on May 29, signals a bold embrace of digital assets by a global sporting powerhouse. PSG Cements Bitcoin as Strategic Reserve According to Helgosson, PSG started quietly acquiring BTC in 2024 and has maintained those holdings since. “We put Bitcoin in our books. We took our fiat reserves and we actually allocated Bitcoin,” the executive stated. “We still have it… as one of the largest clubs in the world, we’re the largest player in the sports ecosystem to do that.” The club’s revelation comes just days before its showpiece UEFA Champions League final match against Italy’s Inter Milan, amplifying the visibility of this strategic shift. It also exceeds earlier crypto experiments like fan tokens, with Helgosson emphasizing the alignment with PSG’s youthful, tech-savvy 550 million strong fanbase, of whom approximately 80% are under age 34. “We’re about what’s next, just like Bitcoin,” he declared. The Ligue 1 champion is also doubling down on its focus on digital assets by supporting entrepreneurs and ventures in the space. “We will help you launch, list, and raise,” said Helgosson, signaling PSG’s intent to function as both an investor and a platform for crypto-native projects. BTC Treasury Wave Catching On The move places the football club alongside recent corporate entrants like GameStop, which revealed on May 28 that it had made its first Bitcoin treasury purchase of 4,710 BTC, worth over $500 million at the time, to become a top holder. It mirrors the relentless accumulation approach pioneered by Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which added another 4,020 BTC for $427 million on May 26, bringing its colossal holdings to 580,250 BTC. Other firms, such as KULR Technology and Japan’s Metaplanet, which formally established Bitcoin Treasury Operations as a core business line, have followed a similar path. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s price has struggled to maintain recent highs. At the time of this writing, the king cryptocurrency was trading at around $106,134, a slight 1.4% dip over the last 24 hours and a 4.54% decline across seven days. Consequently, it has pulled back by more than 5% from its all-time high of $111,814, which it hit last week.

2025-05-30T18:15:16.000Z,"Ripple CEO: XRP Was Designed by Engineers Who Recognized Bitcoin Flaws","Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has once again sparked waves across the digital asset space, this time addressing prominent figures at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Swiss National Bank. In a compelling video clip shared by XRP Avengers on X, Garlinghouse laid out a sharp, unflinching case for XRP’s superiority over Bitcoin, underscoring the intentional design choices that position XRP as a far more scalable and efficient alternative for global payments. Garlinghouse’s Case Against Bitcoin In the widely circulated clip, Garlinghouse confidently articulated the technological limitations of Bitcoin, highlighting its sluggish transaction speeds and high costs . According to the Ripple CEO, Bitcoin’s architecture, while revolutionary in its time, has become a bottleneck for practical use cases, especially in the realm of cross-border payments. Brad Garlinghouse DESTROYS Bitcoin in front of the IMF & Swiss National Bank, presenting the case for $XRP Brad Garlinghouse said “ #XRP was designed by engineers who recognized Bitcoin’s flaws, especially around scalability. XRP is 1,000x faster.” pic.twitter.com/xFL6D41HiM — XRP Avengers (@XRP_Avengers) May 29, 2025 Garlinghouse emphasized that XRP was designed by engineers who had studied Bitcoin’s shortcomings and sought to build something fundamentally better. Specifically, he noted that XRP offers transactions that are 1,000 times faster and 1,000 times cheaper compared to Bitcoin . For Garlinghouse, this distinction isn’t just technical; it’s pivotal to reshaping how the world moves money across borders, particularly for individuals and businesses that are currently sidelined by the inefficiencies of traditional banking systems. The End of Pre-Funding and the Rise of On-Demand Liquidity A central pillar of Ripple’s vision, Garlinghouse explained, is the idea of eliminating the need for pre-funding accounts in global financial transactions. Traditionally, international money movement relies on a web of nostro and vostro accounts, pre-funded holdings that financial institutions use to settle transactions across borders. This system is costly, slow, and often inaccessible to smaller players. Garlinghouse’s argument is clear: digital assets like XRP can provide global liquidity on demand, unlocking a more democratized and efficient payment infrastructure. By doing so, Ripple aims to level the playing field, not just for massive multinational corporations moving hundreds of millions of dollars, but also for the small freelancers and businesses scattered across the globe. He illustrated this point vividly by referencing the case of a freelancer in the Philippines, designing for a London-based company and expecting a modest payment. Under current systems, the freelancer’s payout often gets delayed until they accumulate at least $1,000 in their account, a hurdle that disproportionately affects smaller earners. Garlinghouse contends that Ripple’s technology stack can seamlessly enable such microtransactions, making the global economy more inclusive. Building the Internet of Value Drawing parallels to the foundational protocols of the internet, Garlinghouse likened Ripple’s ambitions to the role played by TCP/IP and HTTP in the rise of the Internet of Information. These early internet protocols revolutionized global communication by standardizing the flow of information across connected devices. According to Garlinghouse, Ripple envisions a similar transformation, but for value. Using blockchain technologies, particularly XRP and its associated open-source technology stack, Ripple aims to construct an Internet of Value where payments can move with the same speed, fluidity, and universality as data. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This vision, he argued, has profound implications for financial inclusion, enabling anyone, anywhere, to participate in the global economy without the burdens imposed by legacy financial systems. It’s not just about helping big banks and corporations; it’s about empowering everyday people and businesses who have long been underserved. XRP’s Technical Edge Over Bitcoin Garlinghouse’s takedown of Bitcoin at the IMF and Swiss National Bank wasn’t just a marketing pitch, it was a detailed exposition of why XRP’s technical architecture matters. Unlike Bitcoin’s proof-of-work system, which demands immense energy consumption and slows down as the network grows, XRP uses a consensus protocol that dramatically accelerates transactions while keeping costs minimal. This makes XRP better suited for high-volume, low-value payments, the kind of microtransactions that are increasingly vital in the digital age. Bitcoin’s design, while robust as a store of value, has struggled to scale effectively for these kinds of applications, leaving a wide opening for Ripple and XRP to step in. Brad Garlinghouse’s address, amplified by XRP Avengers’ viral post, underscores a defining moment in the evolving narrative between Bitcoin and XRP. While Bitcoin continues to hold its position as the pioneer and poster child of cryptocurrencies, Ripple’s CEO is making it clear that the future of cross-border payments requires something faster, cheaper, and more scalable. Ripple’s mission to build an Internet of Value, using XRP as its backbone, is more than just technological ambition; it’s a bid to reshape how money moves in a globalized world. With the support of a passionate community like XRP Avengers and the attention of financial heavyweights like the IMF and Swiss National Bank, Ripple is positioning XRP as not just an alternative to Bitcoin, but as the digital asset purpose-built for the next generation of global finance.

In a new post, crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 789,400 followers on the social media platform X that if Bitcoin can break through the resistance range between $106,500-$107,000, the flagship crypto asset will likely soar beyond its current all-time high of about $111,800. “Bitcoin has lost the crucial support level. However, the drop isn’t as severe as we might expect. This means, reclaim of $106,500-$107,000, that would be the party trigger sign for new all-time highs.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Bitcoin is trading for $105,694 at time of writing, down 1.5% in the last 24 hours. Next up, the analyst says that Ethereum ( ETH ) is likely still in an uptrend and gearing up for a massive breakout. “ETH did break through $2,700 and failed immediately. The thing is, that’s not the crucial level. The second thing is, it’s still building up for a big breakout. When does that happen? Above $2,850 is where the liquidity is and the longer it takes for a breakout to happen, the heavier it will be.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X He also says that ETH has been showing strength against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) for the past two months and may soon break out against the flagship crypto asset. “ETH has seen a strong upwards move in April and May, It has also retested the OB (order block) at 0.023 BTC and has held there. This means that we’re about to test the highs and continue the run.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X ETH/BTC is trading for 0.2461 BTC ($2,597), down slightly in the last 24 hours. Lastly, the analyst says he is turning bullish on Bittensor ( TAO ), a decentralized blockchain-based network that aims to be a marketplace for artificial intelligence (AI) models. “TAO looks great, as it’s fighting the final resistance. Ideally, sub-$400 is a steal for this one in which we continue to show an uptrend even if it drops south of that level. It’s the only one in my portfolio nicely holding up and I think we’ll be seeing $700-$800 soon.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X TAO is trading for $397 at time of writing, down 6.4% in the last 24 hours.

Moreover, the price dropped below the crucial support in the early trading hours and has failed to reclaim the lost levels, which indicates a tight bearish hold over the token. However, the market sentiments remain largely bullish, which suggests the BTC price could rise after the ongoing correction. The Bitcoin’s recent drop isn’t directly attributed to a court decision on tariffs but rather to President Donald Trump’s announcement of imposing tariffs on Canada and Mexico. This move sparked widespread volatility across the markets, causing Bitcoin to plummet below $91,000 and resulting in nearly a billion dollars in total liquidations. Meanwhile, a recent US federal court ruling blocking Trump’s $10 billion tariffs has sparked optimism for Bitcoin’s future. What’s Next- Will Bitcoin Rise to $120K or Drop to $100K? The BTC price recently experienced a significant bullish push, probably due to the Golden Cross, which may soon turn into a death cross. The rising scepticism around the network has made the perp whales optimistic, while the spot traders are preparing for the new BTC highs. As per the data from Binance , the perpetual whales are defending $100K with bids, while spot sellers are looking to sell at $120K. With this, the BTC price forecast remains hung with both the possibility of forming a new ATH at $120K or plunging back to $100K. As seen in the above chart, the BTC price has displayed a similar divergence to that displayed in the first few days of April; however, it is reversed now. On the other hand, the DMI has displayed a bearish crossover while the RSI maintains a steep descending trend. Therefore, the bearish reversal may soon be validated while the price could head to the local support at $102,153 at 0.786 FIB. Here, if the price fails to trigger a rebound, it may drop below $100K, otherwise, a rebound could push it within the resistance zone between $105,937 and $107,615. Now, all depends on the monthly close, which is required to be above the local support; else, the Bitcoin (BTC) price may witness a deeper correction.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-price-displays-a-similar-deviation-is-it-time-for-a-deeper-correction/,"BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

Detective Drove Victim to Kidnap Site, Reports Claim According to reports , both detectives in question were working as off-duty security for the alleged crypto criminal, though whether they received prior approval from the department is unknown. New: The NYPD stripped 2 detectives of their guns /badges & placed them on desk duty after the dept. learned they'd had been working security for William Duplessie & John Woeltz, the crypto investors recently arrested for allegedly kidnapping a man & torturing him. @CBSNewYork pic.twitter.com/BBsS9uVR2U — Tim McNicholas (@TimMcNicholas) May 29, 2025 One of the detectives, a veteran with nearly 20 years of experience, reportedly drove the Italian crypto kidnapping victim from the airport to the luxury SoHo apartment where he was eventually held captive. “Every city employee is expected to follow the law, including our officers, both on and off duty,” the mayor’s office said in a statement. “We are disturbed by these allegations, and as soon as it came to our attention, the officers were placed on modified duty.” Two Arrested in Shock Crypto Kidnapping News of the scandal comes just one week after the unidentified Italian businessman escaped the weeks-long crypto crime ordeal that saw him shocked, tortured and held at gunpoint. Crypto businessmen John Woeltz and William Duplessie allegedly lured the victim to New York City on May 6 after threatening to kill his family in a bid to gain access to his Bitcoin . The hostage escaped barefoot when Duplessie and Woeltz turned their backs on him shortly after he revealed his Bitcoin password. Reports indicate that the anonymous victim may have been a business partner of Duplessie and Woeltz, although this has not been confirmed. The family of Woeltz told The New York Post on Monday that the multimillionaire may have been “manipulated” into the crime himself. “He’s a kind, caring, loving person, so he was completely controlled by other people,” Woeltz’s relative told the media outlet.

2025-05-30T17:39:17.000Z,"BTC dip is opening doors for new investors, yet analysts favor RUVI for higher profits","Bitcoin, the king of cryptocurrencies, has experienced a decline that many see as an opportunity for new investors to join the crypto market at a lower cost. However, while Bitcoin’s entry point may seem appealing, analysts are increasingly directing attention toward Ruvi AI, an emerging cryptocurrency with exponential potential. With a record-breaking presale and significant partnerships, Ruvi AI is positioned to deliver stronger gains than the established Bitcoin. Here’s how Bitcoin’s dip compares to Ruvi AI’s rise and why it’s being hailed as the smarter investment choice. Bitcoin’s decline creates market entry opportunities Bitcoin’s recent downturn may appear disheartening to long-time investors but has opened the door for new market participants. Lower prices provide an opportunity to buy into a well-established cryptocurrency without the high costs associated with Bitcoin’s all-time highs. Bitcoin’s reputation as a decentralized digital asset and its wide acceptance in traditional and emerging markets make it a staple in the crypto world. However, price stagnation and high market cap have created limitations for Bitcoin’s future growth. Its dominance, while notable, has somewhat plateaued, providing modest returns for those entering now. While Bitcoin’s reputation as a high-value asset remains intact, its growth potential pales in comparison to opportunities in more dynamic, emerging cryptocurrencies. Ruvi AI’s utility and early-stage potential Unlike Bitcoin, Ruvi AI is rooted in utility and innovation, making it a compelling investment for those seeking substantial returns. By combining artificial intelligence and blockchain, Ruvi AI addresses real-world challenges in industries like healthcare, logistics, and finance. Industry applications driving growth Healthcare: Ruvi AI facilitates AI-powered solutions for diagnostics and improved patient care, streamlining medical processes. Logistics: Its advanced algorithms optimize supply chains, reducing inefficiencies and operational costs. Finance: Ruvi AI offers AI-driven tools for fraud detection and secure transactions, making it invaluable for financial institutions. Rather than relying solely on market trends like Bitcoin, Ruvi AI’s adoption in these scalable industries ensures consistent demand and long-term relevance. Enhancing accessibility with WEEX partnership Ruvi AI recently partnered with WEEX Exchange, a collaboration that enhances liquidity and ensures global access. This partnership allows investors from across the world to trade Ruvi AI tokens effortlessly, broadening the project’s user base and improving token usability. The WEEX partnership cements Ruvi AI’s vision of becoming a globally recognized and utility-driven cryptocurrency. Record-breaking presale and investment potential Ruvi AI’s early momentum has been hard to ignore. The project’s presale has already sold 125 million tokens, raising an impressive $1.4 million. With an entry price of $0.015 per token, even small-scale investors can participate in its planned growth. Its VIP bonus structure makes the investment even more attractive, offering scalable rewards: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment with 40% bonus): Total Tokens: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $1: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment with 60% bonus): Total Tokens: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $1: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment with 100% bonus): Total Tokens: 1,280,000 (double the base allocation). Value at $1: $1,280,000. With analysts projecting Ruvi AI to reach $1 by Q4 2025, the potential 100x return is far more exciting compared to Bitcoin’s current growth trajectory. Bitcoin vs Ruvi AI: the smarter investment While Bitcoin remains a trusted name in cryptocurrency, its growth potential is relatively limited due to its maturity and high market cap. Ruvi AI, by contrast, offers early-stage growth, practical utility, and groundbreaking technologies that align with industries demanding immediate solutions. Its affordable entry point, presale success, and global reach through partnerships like WEEX make it a standout choice for forward-thinking investors. Final thoughts Bitcoin’s decline may be a tempting opportunity, but for those seeking larger and faster returns, Ruvi AI presents a more exciting avenue. Its utility-driven roadmap, ongoing partnerships, and exponential ROI potential set it apart from traditional players in the crypto landscape. For investors looking to capitalize on the next wave of cryptocurrency innovation, Ruvi AI could very well be the smartest investment choice of 2025.

Bitcoin BTC is down 2.1% in the last 24 hours, trading just above $104,000 after briefly hitting a session low of $103,900. The CoinDesk 20 — an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, except for stablecoins, memecoins and exchange coins — slumped even further, by 4.2%. Smart contract platforms were particularly affected, with solana SOL, sui SUI and avalanche AVAX losing 6.3%, 7.8% and 7.3% respectively. Crypto stocks also took a hit, especially bitcoin mining firm Bitdeer (BTDR), down 8.3% on the day after a run-up that saw the stock rise 132% from April 16 to May 21. Strategy (MSTR) slid 2.7%, and Coinbase (COIN) 1.3%. The bleeding wasn’t contained to crypto. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are down 1% and 1.5% respectively, while gold lost 0.7%. U.S.-China tariff clash: Round 2? Behind the price action was the flare-up of U.S. trade tensions once again after an agreement was struck earlier this month. The concerns came after President Donald Trump accused China in a post on Truth Social of \""violating\"" the tariff truce between the countries. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a Fox News interview that talks had \""stalled\"" with the Chinese representatives.

Korea’s presidential race with a 96.8% chance on Polymarket. The June 3 election is pivotal for crypto policy; 36% of eligible S. Korean voters own crypto. Candidates propose pro-crypto measures like spot Bitcoin ETFs and improved bank access. Lee Jae-myung is emerging as a frontrunner for South Korea’s 2025 presidential election, according to trader sentiment on Polymarket.

Polymarket is a decentralized prediction market where users bet real money on future events. Each “Yes” share pays out $1 if the event occurs and nothing if it does not. The closer the price is to $1, the higher the market’s confidence in that outcome. Meanwhile, the pricing does not reflect polling or vote share. A common misconception is that a 97-cent “Yes” price equates to 97% of expected votes. In reality, the figure reflects the collective probability, as perceived by market participants, that Lee will win the election.

2025-05-30T17:20:23.000Z,"How to Do Cloud Mining in 2025: HashFly Review & Beginner’s Guide to Bitcoin Mining","Discover how to mine Bitcoin in 2025 with HashFly, the world’s leading cloud mining platform. Learn how to get started, earn daily crypto rewards, and explore flexible, eco-friendly mining contracts. Cloud mining has emerged as a compelling alternative for individuals seeking to profit from digital assets like Bitcoin without the complexities associated with traditional mining or trading. Platforms such as HashFly are at the forefront, offering accessible and potentially lucrative avenues for both novices and seasoned investors.​ The Appeal of Cloud Mining Cloud mining involves renting computing power from remote data centers to mine cryptocurrencies. This model eliminates the need for personal mining equipment, thereby reducing concerns related to hardware costs, maintenance, and energy consumption. In 2025, cloud mining has become particularly appealing due to several factors:​ Lower Upfront Costs: Traditional mining requires significant investment in hardware and infrastructure. Cloud mining allows users to participate without these substantial initial expenses. ​ Operational Efficiency: By outsourcing the technical aspects of mining to specialized providers, individuals can avoid the complexities of hardware setup and maintenance. ​ Accessibility: Cloud mining opens the door for those who may lack the technical expertise or resources to engage in traditional mining, democratizing access to cryptocurrency profits. ​ Regular Passive Income: Participants can earn a consistent stream of cryptocurrency rewards, providing a potential source of passive income. ​ Positive Outlook for the Cryptocurrency Market The cryptocurrency market in 2025 is experiencing transformative growth, bolstered by increased institutional adoption and regulatory clarity. Analysts predict that Bitcoin could reach between $190,000 and $210,000 by the end of the year, driven by its finite supply and rising institutional demand. Additionally, the global market for cryptocurrency trends is projected to grow from $2.1 billion in 2024 to $5 billion by 2030, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.4%. ​ Cloud Mining vs. Traditional Trading While traditional cryptocurrency trading involves buying and selling digital assets to capitalize on price fluctuations, it requires a deep understanding of market dynamics and can be highly volatile. Cloud mining offers a more stable and predictable alternative:​ Predictable Returns: Cloud mining contracts often provide fixed returns, offering a level of predictability not typically found in trading. ​ Reduced Risk Exposure: By participating in mining, individuals can earn cryptocurrency rewards without being directly exposed to market volatility. ​ Diversification: Engaging in cloud mining allows investors to diversify their cryptocurrency portfolio, balancing the risks associated with trading. Comparing Cloud Mining to Other Crypto Income Models In the broader context of earning through crypto, cloud mining offers an attractive alternative to other models like staking, yield farming, or day trading. Each method has its own risk-reward dynamics: Staking requires locking up assets for a period of time and is generally limited to proof-of-stake (PoS) cryptocurrencies. While it’s relatively low-risk, the returns can be modest compared to cloud mining. Yield Farming, largely driven by decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, is highly volatile and often exposed to smart contract risks, rug pulls, and impermanent loss. Day Trading, while potentially lucrative, demands constant monitoring, technical expertise, and a high tolerance for market volatility. Cloud mining , by contrast, provides a more passive and predictable income stream, especially for those who want exposure to the crypto economy without devoting full-time effort or technical know-how. And with platforms like HashFlyoffering contracts starting as low as $50, it also opens the door for low-risk experimentation. ​ HashFly: Leading the Way in Cloud Mining Founded in 2013, HashFly has established itself as a prominent player in the cloud mining industry, offering services for major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Litecoin (LTC).

2025-05-30T17:19:08.000Z,"European Central Bank Warns Banks Against Rushing Into Crypto","As traditional banks in Europe become more involved with cryptocurrencies, the European Central Bank (ECB) is growing concerned. On May 30, ECB policymaker and Governor of the Bank of Italy, Fabio Panetta, gave a severe warning. He said that banks working closely with crypto companies could risk customer trust, which, if lost, could cause the whole financial system to suffer. ECB Warns Crypto Losses Could Damage Trust in Banks Panetta shared his thoughts during the Bank of Italy’s annual report presentation. He explained that many people do not fully understand the risk associated with crypto assets. If banks start offering these assets, customers might believe they are as safe as regular savings or investment products. However, they are not. Digital currencies are risky and not protected in the same way as normal bank services. He explained that the concern is about individual losses and trust. If enough people lose confidence in banks because of crypto losses, it could harm the entire credit system. Panetta’s view on crypto aligns with that of Swiss National Bank (SNB) President Martin Schlegel. Schlegel said the bank will not hold Bitcoin as a reserve in April. He explained that Bitcoin’s well-known price swings made it unsuitable for the bank’s needs . Schlegel stated that stability is critical for any asset worthy of national reserve inclusion. Banks Are Moving Ahead With Crypto Plans Even with these warnings, some banks are already making moves in the crypto space. Earlier this year, Intesa Sanpaolo, one of Italy’s largest banks, bought €1 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC). The bank’s CEO, Carlo Messina, called this acquisition a “test.” On the other hand, it is also part of a larger plan. The bank now has its digital asset trading desk and handles crypto trades. In Spain, Santander is also preparing to enter the crypto market . According to reports, the bank is considering creating its stablecoin and offering crypto services through its digital app. Reportedly, top banks like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo are working together to launch a joint stablecoin project . These steps show that major banks are becoming more active in crypto. This is happening quickly, and some experts believe that regulations are not keeping up. ECB Calls for Caution It is important to note that Fabio Panetta is not against change. However, he believes that banks and regulators need to be more careful. He highlighted that the main problem is trust. Banks are seen as safe and reliable. If people lose money through crypto services offered by banks, that trust could break. He emphasized that rebuilding may be difficult to rebuild once it is broken.

While the US is leading in Bitcoin accumulation and hashrate distribution, the UAE is starting to develop into a rather big player in the global Bitcoin ecosystem, especially in the Middle East. Officially, the US holds the most Bitcoin with more than 207k in its fold, but some reports suggest that the UAE holds approximately 420k Bitcoin, valued at around $46 billion. However, there are no official sources to support the claim, as this is more of a rumor that’s been spreading around. Even Changpeng Zhao (former CEO of Binance) shared this news last year on X but eventually deleted that post, likely due to no solid evidence. Still, the UAE definitely holds some Bitcoin and the country is rapidly advancing its Bitcoin mining capabilities, with an estimated operational capacity of 400 megawatts last year.

2025-05-30T17:07:20.000Z,"Crypto Regulation Chaos: Trump Dinner, $2.5B Bitcoin Play, SEC Drops Binance Suit","It’s been a blockbuster week in U.S. crypto regulation, as power players in Washington and Wall Street grapple with digital assets, cybersecurity, and political influence. From Trump’s meme coin dinner to the SEC’s stunning reversal on Binance, a new era in crypto regulation may be dawning—and not without controversy. Trump’s Meme Coin Dinner Sparks Transparency Backlash On May 25, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson dodged pointed questions about a private meme coin dinner hosted by President Donald Trump at his Virginia golf club earlier in the week. Speaker Mike Johnson sidestepped transparency questions on Trump’s meme coin dinner, as Democrats call for a DOJ probe. #trump #memecoin https://t.co/IST3Gu2foM — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 26, 2025 The event, reportedly attended by top investors in the Trump-themed “TRUMP” meme coin, has raised red flags among Democrats, 35 of whom have called on the Department of Justice to investigate possible corruption and foreign influence. In a CNN interview, Johnson claimed ignorance of the May 22 event and refused to comment on whether the guest list should be released. With crypto now playing a visible role in campaign fundraising and narrative-building, critics argue that unchecked intersections between politics and digital assets pose serious ethical questions. Banking Lobby Pushes Back Against SEC Cyber Rule While political tensions flared, financial institutions were busy behind the scenes. On May 22, U.S. banking heavyweights—including the American Bankers Association, Bank Policy Institute, and SIFMA—petitioned the SEC to withdraw its controversial cybersecurity incident disclosure rule. The regulation, known as Item 1.05 in Form 8-K, mandates disclosure of material cyber incidents within four business days. However, industry groups warn that this requirement endangers national security, disrupts law enforcement efforts, and causes unnecessary panic. Their message: transparency shouldn’t come at the cost of an effective cybersecurity response. David Sacks Floats ‘Budget-Neutral’ Bitcoin Reserve Strategy In a more surprising development, David Sacks—a key White House adviser on crypto and artificial intelligence—proposed that the U.S. could begin acquiring Bitcoin without increasing the national debt. White House’s David Sacks Hints at Budget-Neutral Path for U.S. Bitcoin Purchases through asset reallocation rather than new spending. #Bitcoin #Bitcoin2025 https://t.co/xX9g1PBwWs — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 28, 2025 Speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas on May 27, Sacks hinted that Treasury assets could be reallocated to build a strategic Bitcoin reserve, suggesting a shift toward digital gold without new government spending. This “budget-neutral” strategy could become a foundational talking point if the next administration, potentially Trump-led, leans further into Bitcoin as a geopolitical hedge. Trump Media Bets $2.5 Billion on Bitcoin Treasury Strategy In tandem with the government’s speculative interest in Bitcoin, Trump Media & Technology Group is taking decisive action. The company behind Truth Social announced a private placement offering worth $2.5 billion to amass what could become one of the largest corporate Bitcoin treasuries in history. The funding, split between $1.5 billion in common stock and $1 billion in convertible notes, is expected to close by May 29. With the president’s brand directly tied to both political and crypto narratives, this move solidifies Trump’s role as an emerging Bitcoin maximalist, at least in the public eye. Departing CFTC Commissioner Warns of ‘Big Swings’ in Oversight Even as crypto gains institutional favor, regulatory instability looms. Christy Romero, outgoing commissioner of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), issued a cautionary note during her farewell remarks at the Brookings Institution. As she exits the CFTC, Christy Romero issues a warning: “big swings” in regulatory policies could crack the foundation of U.S. markets. #ChristyRomero #CFTC https://t.co/w1aSAb44E5 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 27, 2025 Romero warned that “big swings” between aggressive regulation and hands-off deregulation could jeopardize the integrity of U.S. financial markets. While she didn’t name names, the remarks are widely seen as a critique of the Trump administration’s shifting stance on digital assets and market oversight. Department of Labor Reverses 401(k) Crypto Ban Another reversal this week came from the U.S. Department of Labor. On May 28, it rescinded its 2022 guidance that discouraged cryptocurrency in workplace retirement plans. The prior policy had warned plan sponsors to exercise “extreme care” and triggered investigations into firms offering crypto options. U.S. Department of Labor Reverses Crypto Guidance, Opens Door for 401(k) Bitcoin Exposure, ending Biden-era restrictions. #Crypto #401k https://t.co/9Pw4USYtwS — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 28, 2025 Now, the reversal indicates a more neutral stance on crypto regulation, opening the door for Bitcoin to return as a viable 401(k) asset—a potentially transformative development for crypto adoption among retail investors. SEC Ends Lawsuit Against Binance, CZ In perhaps the week’s most jaw-dropping twist, the SEC dropped its high-profile lawsuit against Binance and its former CEO Changpeng Zhao. The case, filed in June 2023, accused the exchange of inflating volumes and mishandling customer funds. @SECGov and @binance legal clash ends as U.S. regulator drops landmark lawsuit. #binance #SEC https://t.co/Qlz11yoG4n — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 30, 2025 On May 29, both parties jointly signed a dismissal, bringing an end to a two-year saga that had cast a shadow over the global exchange. The sudden conclusion leaves observers wondering: Is the crypto industry’s biggest regulatory battle truly over or just entering a new phase? This week revealed a U.S. crypto sector at an inflection point. While Trump allies promote digital assets through political events and billion-dollar treasuries, regulators are struggling to keep pace—and often stepping back.

2025-05-30T17:00:36.000Z,"Analyst: Cardano To $10 In 2025? These 5 Catalysts Could Ignite ADA","Cardano staking pool operator (SPO) Sssebi (@Av_Sebastian) has ignited a debate by asserting that Cardano’s ADA could reach double-digit territory this year. In a thread that began, “These are the ingredients for $10 $ADA in 2025,” he listed five developments he believes will transform the eighth-largest cryptocurrency from a $0.70 token into a $10 asset. Each of those “ingredients” is now taking shape—and each comes with its own uncertainties. #1 Cardano Becomes Bitcoin’s DeFi Layer At the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Input Output (IO) stunned attendees by moving a live Bitcoin Ordinal across a new BitVM-based bridge to Cardano. IO called the demonstration “a preview of what is to come,” adding that the “Cardinal” protocol aims for full integration so BTC holders can lend, borrow and stake inside Cardano’s extended-UTxO environment. By transplanting Bitcoin liquidity onto a programmable ledger without wrapped custodial tokens, Cardano positions itself as a settlement layer for so-called BTCFi applications—an addressable market that today tops $1 trillion in dormant value. Related Reading: Cardano: Elliot Wave Predicts 50% Crash For ADA Price, Is It Time To Get Out #2 The Midnight “Glacier Drop” Airdrop Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson told Consensus 2025 in Toronto that Midnight, his privacy-focused sidechain, will airdrop both NIGHT governance tokens and DUST privacy tokens to “approximately 37 million wallets across eight major blockchains”—with “zero allocation to venture capitalists.” “Every Consensus there’s a new token saying, ‘my thing is better,’” he said. “We’re going to give this away and let users decide.” The sheer scale dwarfs recent airdrops and could seed tens of millions of new ADA-capable addresses once Midnight’s cross-chain fee model pushes traffic back to the base chain. #3 A US Listed Cardano Spot ETF In February NYSE Arca filed to convert the Grayscale Cardano Trust into a spot ETF. The Securities and Exchange Commission acknowledged the application on 24 February, starting a 240-day clock that now runs to 22 October 2025. The agency’s first-phase deadline of 29 May was pushed to 15 July, following the pattern that preceded January’s Bitcoin ETF approvals. Grayscale has argued that ADA’s on-chain transparency and staking mechanics make it “substantially resistant to manipulation,” echoing the language that ultimately persuaded regulators on Bitcoin. An approval would give traditional investors a regulated conduit to stake-enabled yield—something no US crypto ETF yet offers. Related Reading: Cardano Whale Activity Spikes – 80 Million ADA Added In 48 Hours #4 ADA In The US Strategic Reserve President Donald Trump’s March executive order created a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a US Digital Asset Stockpile to hold crypto seized in federal cases. A subsequent Truth Social post surprised markets by naming “XRP, Solana and Cardano” for inclusion alongside Bitcoin and Ether; ADA jumped more than 70% intraday. Though the order bars fresh purchases of altcoins, Treasury accounting shows roughly $493 million in non-Bitcoin assets—ADA among them—already earmarked. Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov called the move “a reputational boost, signaling the US. views digital assets as strategic.” Inclusion in a sovereign reserve legitimises ADA for conservative allocators and could ease the path for futures and options listings. #5 The Ouroboros Leios Upgrade Hoskinson labels Leios “the capstone of the entire Ouroboros agenda … the fastest cryptocurrency on the planet.” In a May 1 livestream he said simulations show “tens of thousands of transactions per second” without sacrificing decentralization. The upgrade introduces parallel input, ranking and endorsement blocks, allowing throughput to be dialed up as adoption demands. If main-net integration lands in H2 2025, Leios would coincide with Midnight’s launch and the ETF review window—an alignment bulls see as catalytic. ADA trades near $0.70 today, implying a market capitalization of roughly $25 billion. A jump to $10 would push valuation toward $350 billion, rivaling Ethereum’s 2024 peak.

2025-05-30T16:55:51.000Z,"US Authorities Sanction Philippines-Based Firm for Allegedly Providing Computer Infrastructure for Crypto Pig Butchering Scams","The U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is taking action against a Philippines-based company accused of facilitating a popular crypto investment scam. In a statement, the Treasury Department says that Funnull Technology Inc. is facing US sanctions for allegedly providing computer infrastructure to hundreds of thousands of websites engaged in pig butchering scams. Perpetrators of pig butchering scams use fake identities to build online relationships with unsuspecting individuals with the aim of introducing them to fraudulent cryptocurrency investment opportunities. Criminal organizations based in Southeast Asia largely carry out the scheme by exploiting victims of human trafficking. Funnull purportedly buys IP addresses from major cloud services companies and sells these to cybercriminals to host scam platforms and malicious websites. The company also provides services that make it easier for bad actors to impersonate trusted brands and allow them to quickly change to a different domain name and IP address when the legitimate providers attempt to take the websites down. In 2014, Funnull bought and altered a repository of codes used by web developers to redirect visitors of legitimate sites to scam and online gambling sites, some of which are associated with Chinese criminal money laundering operations. The Treasury Department says that Funnull has ties to the majority of the crypto investment scam websites that were reported to the FBI. US-based victims claim losing over $200 million to these schemes, or an average of $150,000 per individual. The OFAC is also imposing sanctions against Funnull’s administrator, Chinese national Liu Lizhi, who was in possession of documents that contain information about the company’s employees, including their performance and progress on tasks.
