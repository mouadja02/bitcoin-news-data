U.S. traders can now buy and sell BTC and ETH futures anytime. 24/7 XRP & SOL Futures To Launch Soon Now, it is planning to launch 24/7 trading for XRP and SOL futures, starting June 13. This will help bridge the gap between traditional U.S. hours and the global markets. Derivatives now make up over 75% of the global crypto trading. Coinbase aims to get a larger share. Starting June 13, we’re enabling 24×7 trading for $XRP and Solana ( $SOL ) futures, unlocking real-time access to U.S. traders, reflecting the always-on nature of crypto markets. — Coinbase Institutional (@CoinbaseInsto) May 29, 2025 “ The arrival of 24/7 CFTC-regulated markets is a game-changer for the industry ,” said Andy Sears, CEO of Coinbase Financial Markets. More Futures and Perpetual Contracts Coinbase rolled out Solana futures in February, followed by XRP and nano XRP futures last month. In Thursday’s trading, Nano Solana topped the charts with over 23,000 contracts traded. XRP futures also saw strong action, with more than 13,000 contracts traded across both standard and nano sizes. It is also now offering futures contracts for SOL, XRP, ADA, and HBAR. The exchange is also about to launch perpetual BTC and ETH futures in the U.S., a new way to trade crypto, which is designed to meet the high demand for crypto derivatives within a fully regulated setting. While Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the core of Coinbase’s derivatives, the strong early demand shows that traders are showing interest in altcoin futures, too.

2025-05-30T03:30:02.000Z,"Bitcoin Rally Stalls at $108K as Key Risk Metric Flashes Red, Is Correction Looming?","Bitcoin (BTC) has recently experienced a slight slowdown after its impressive upward run, trading at $108,012 at the time of writing. Over the past week, Bitcoin has recorded a 3.1% decline, indicating a moderate pullback from recent highs. However, despite this short-term downtrend, the asset continues to hold steady above significant support levels, suggesting minimal selling pressure from market participants. Amid the current pullback phase, analysts have started to express caution regarding Bitcoin’s immediate outlook. In particular, one CryptoQuant analyst known by the handle Crazzyblockk highlighted the emergence of an elevated market risk signal through the “Standardized 60-Day Realized Cap Volatility (RCV)” metric. This indicator, frequently monitored by investors to assess risk levels, has reportedly crossed a critical historical threshold. Related Reading: Bitcoin $106,800 Support Retest To Determine Next Move – Breakout Or Breakdown Ahead? Understanding the Elevated Risk Signal The 60-Day Standardized RCV, as explained by Crazzyblockk, measures the variance between Bitcoin’s realized capitalization, essentially the cumulative value at which all coins last moved, and its market capitalization. This metric is normalized to account for volatility, thus helping investors detect significant shifts in market sentiment. Currently, the Standardized RCV value has reached 1.9, surpassing the 1.5 threshold traditionally viewed as indicative of high market risk. Historically, when the 60-Day Standardized RCV exceeds values between 1.5 and 1.9, it has often preceded local market peaks or considerable corrections. According to the analyst, these elevated readings indicate periods when investor behavior, characterized by increased profit-taking and speculative activities, diverges notably from Bitcoin’s fundamental valuation. Implications for Bitcoin Investors The current Standardized RCV reading suggests that Bitcoin’s market might be approaching a point of heightened caution. Although this indicator alone is not a definitive sell signal, it does suggest investors should adopt a more conservative risk management approach, especially in regard to new positions or leveraged trades. This cautious stance aligns with historical data from other widely monitored metrics like the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio and the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), both of which currently reflect similarly heightened risk levels. For investors, the present scenario necessitates careful consideration of market conditions before making strategic moves. The Standardized RCV indicator serves as a precise gauge to navigate market volatility, advising investors to consider reducing exposure, tightening stop-losses, or potentially waiting for a clearer alignment of price with underlying fundamentals before making substantial commitments. Crazzyblockk noted: Now is a time for risk management, not euphoria. Investors may consider reducing exposure, tightening stops, or awaiting a retest of fundamentals before re-entry. Standardized RCV continues to be a precision tool in navigating crypto volatility.

2025-05-30T03:24:48.000Z,"Crypto Staking Doesn't Violate U.S. Securities Law, SEC Says","Crypto staking, under certain circumstances, does not appear to implicate U.S. securities law, a branch of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said late Thursday. The SEC's Division of Corporation Finance published a staff statement — the latest in a series from the regulator — spelling out how the regulator may evaluate proof-of-stake networks, mainly noting that covered activities do not \""involve the offer and sale of securities\"" — meaning the SEC won't sue any person or company participating in those activities. Node operators and validators, custodians, delegates, nominators and entities staking assets either on their own, staking directly with a third party or staking on behalf of an asset's owners fall into this bucket, the staff statement said. In this, the SEC seems to suggest that staking will be treated identically to mining, the consensus mechanism securing networks like Bitcoin BTC, which the SEC clarified also did not implicate securities laws in a similar staff statement last month. The SEC's staff statement was \""very clear for a subject that can be a little bit complicated,\"" said Lorien Gabel, the CEO of staking-focused crypto firm Figment. And its main upside appears to be saying that various activities U.S. companies might have shied away from in the past are okay now. \""They included some ancillary staking activities. For example, we provide insurance around slashing [and we also provide] modified unbonding periods ,\"" he said. \""And they said that actually doesn't mean that you're a manager of assets as a staking provider.\"" The SEC statement said companies that want to provide those types of services, or even pooled staking, can do so, he said. Thursday's statement is an incremental but important update from the regulator, said Alison Mangiero, the head of staking policy at the Crypto Council for Innovation. \""This reaffirms that there's going to be similar treatment for stakers that there is for miners. And I think it's especially important because, given under [former SEC Chair Gary] Gensler, there were so many enforcement actions that were focused on staking as a service … we saw a lot of those cases dismissed, and the Coinbase case dismissed with prejudice,\"" she said. \""We assumed that this would be the stance, but actually having a staff statement that asserts it, I think is crucially important.\"" The fact it came just days before the SEC faces a deadline on a number of applications to bring staking into spot ether ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is telling, she said. It's likely that the ETF providers would have received staking approvals regardless, but the SEC statement will likely start speeding up the process for securing those approvals, Gabel said. As with the SEC's previous staff statements, Thursday's included a footnote clarifying that it is very narrowly tailored and certain restrictions would apply. It is not a replacement for rulemaking done through the actual commissioners and \""has no legal force or effect,\"" the footnote said. \""This statement only addresses certain activities involving Covered Crypto Assets that do not have intrinsic economic properties or rights, such as generating a passive yield or conveying rights to future income, profits, or assets of a business enterprise,\"" another footnote said.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/news-analysis/2025/05/29/crypto-staking-doesnt-violate-us-securities-law-sec-says,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|REGULATION","News Analysis|SEC|Staking|Exclusive|News",cryptocompare

According to a Thursday announcement, Fastex will offer spot crypto trading services of tokens including bitcoin BTC, ether ETH, Cardano ADA, Solana SOL and its native utility token, Fasttoken FTN, to both retail and institutional investors in the U.S. Fastex’s American expansion comes as the U.S. continues to overhaul its approach to crypto regulation under President Donald Trump’s administration. Since Trump took office in January, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has retreated from the so-called regulation-by-enforcement approach to crypto it took under former Chair Gary Gensler, dropping a host of open investigations and closing ongoing litigation against crypto exchanges. In an interview with CoinDesk at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas, Fastex’s Chief Legal Officer and board member Vardan Khachatryan said that the SEC’s softened stance toward crypto regulation played a major role in the exchange’s decision to expand in the U.S., though he acknowledged that there is still no concrete legal framework for crypto in the country. “There has been enough of a policy change, at least in terms of [how the U.S. government is] viewing things, that allowed us to go for this,” Khachatryan said. “It’s still kind of a risk, but it’s a lower risk.” With a host of crypto companies returning to the U.S. due to the Trump Administration's crypto-friendly policies, cities like New York are hoping to attract companies expanding to the U.S. to set up shop in their jurisdictions. But, while Khachatryan said New York would be “the right place to be in terms of headquarters,” he said that, for now, the prospect of obtaining a BitLicense — the notoriously difficult-to-obtain crypto license issued by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) — is prohibitive. “I hope that things will change a bit,” Khachatryan said. New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who has branded himself the “Bitcoin Mayor” in an attempt to lure crypto companies to New York, called for the end to the BitLicense regime during a speech at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas on Wednesday.

The price is now correcting losses and might aim for a move above the $2.250 resistance. XRP price started a fresh decline below the $2.280 zone. The price is now trading below $2.270 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.270 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start another decline if it fails to clear the $2.2440 level. XRP Price Dips Further XRP price failed to clear the $0.3550 resistance and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . There was a move below the $0.3000 and $0.280 support levels.

2025-05-30T03:04:29.000Z,"XXRP: Volatility On Top Of Volatility","Summary XRP exposure is possible in the US via the Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP ETF, despite the absence of spot ETFs or CEFs for XRP. XXRP uses swaps to provide leveraged XRP exposure, but carries heightened risk and volatility compared to spot products. XRP is already more volatile than other digital assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum. So XXRP is volatility on top of volatility. Long-term investors should use the futures ETF or wait for spot XRP ETFs rather than holding leveraged products like XXRP. In my recent coverage of the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund ETF ( OTC:BITW ) for Seeking Alpha, I made note of how it was becoming increasingly possible to mimic the top holdings of that fund but through allocating to various ETFs and closed-end funds in a traditional a self-directed IRA. At 90% combined allocation between Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), spot ETFs are useful tools for self-directing asset weightings. Allocating the 3% exposure to Solana ( SOL-USD ) is also quite easy given the OTC market offers two different closed-end funds as well as a futures-based ETF. 5% of BITW assets are in XRP ( XRP-USD ). Despite the US market lacking spot ETFs or OTC market CEF shares, traders can get exposed to XRP through the Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP ETF ( XXRP ). In this article, we'll look at Teucrium's fund details, how it allocates XRP exposure, and why speculators with longer term time horizons should wait for spot ETFs rather than sitting in XXRP shares. Fund Details & Objective The objective of the Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP ETF is very simple; XXRP aims to double the return of XRP on a daily basis. To its credit, Teucrium is very overt about the fact that the fund will ultimately lag the performance of XRP over time. We'll detail that a bit more in the risks section later in this article. Believe it or not, XXRP is not the only 2x leveraged XRP ETF in the market today. In the time since my May 21st BITW article , we have seen a second 2x leveraged XRP fund begin trading, with the Volatility Shares 2x XRP ETF ( XRPT ) launching on May 22nd. Here's a straightforward comparison between the funds: Fund Comparison XXRP XRPT Issuer Teucrium Volatility Shares LLC Inception 04/07/2025 05/22/2025 Expense Ratio 1.89% 0.94% AUM $100.24M $1.70M Source: Seeking Alpha With respect to being first to market, the only real advantage XXRP has over XRPT at this point in time is liquidity. With just over $100 million in AUM against less than $2 million for XRPT, traders will likely have a far easier time executing orders at desirable prices through XXRP if they want to go the leveraged fund route. Since these funds are not to be held for longer than a few days or weeks (at most), the expense ratio likely doesn't matter as much as the liquidity difference. But it is worth pointing out that XXRP is roughly double the price of XRPT, purely by the fees associated with holding the funds. XRP Swaps Since there isn't a spot ETF for XRP yet in the US market, XXRP utilizes swap agreements with global financial institutions that allow Teucrium and its counter-parties to make payments based on XRP reference assets or benchmarks. Those could include the CME CF XRP-Dollar Reference Rate, the CME CF XRP-Dollar Real-Time Index, or a handful of European XRP ETPs that are listed below: 21Shares XRP ETP Bitwise Physical XRP ETP Virtune XRP ETP WisdomTree Physical XRP ETP CoinShares Physical XRP ETP In addition to these 'XRP Swaps,' Teucrium may also hold XRP futures contracts and/or XRP options. But the point is, XXRP doesn't actually provide speculators with direct exposure to XRP. Which is definitely a consideration that US buyers should keep in mind if they want to minimize third-party risk to the degree that they can. That said, for this type of product, that concern is likely minimal. The larger concern is long term decay. 2x Leveraged ETF Risks As is generally the case with every leveraged ETF product in the market today, funds like XXRP are designed for short-term holding rather than long-term investment. For those seeking a tactical trading tool, 2x funds like XXRP can be great. The advantage they have over taking positions with margin is the leveraged funds limit downside. Trading with margin can result in a call to pledge more collateral. However, with leveraged ETFs, a trader can only lose what is put into the position. Furthermore, unlike something like 0DTE options, there is no expiration on leveraged ETF positions. So holding time can be as long as the idea is winning, or the trader has an ability to endure pain. On the latter, Teucrium's prospectus makes it very clear that XXRP is not designed for long-term holding and will ultimately lag the return of XRP if held for too long: The return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of its return for each day compounded over the period. The Fund’s returns for periods longer than a single day will very likely differ in amount, and possibly even direction, from the Fund’s stated multiple (2x) times the return of daily changes in the price of XRP for the same period. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund will lose money if XRP’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Fund will lose money even if the price of XRP increases. As I've said in my numerous articles covering at least a dozen leveraged ETFs prior to this one, it is imperative that entries and exits in these types of products are timed properly. Sustained periods of chop or sideways action will not help XXRP holders. While the trading history for XXRP is admittedly small since inception in early-April, we can already see how sideways action is bad for the fund: Data by YCharts The chart above shows the price performances of XRP and XXRP since April 28th. The price or XRP is roughly flat at 0.79% over the last month, yet XXRP is down nearly 10%. Some of this is due to the added volatility that comes with a 2x leveraged ETF - that volatility is entirely by design. But the volatility is compounded because XRP itself is also highly volatile. XRP Volatility I've covered XRP based on network fundamentals a handful of times for SA and recently updated that view back in April: For me, the chain usage data is actually pretty encouraging. We see transactions up over time, DAAs making highs, and even fees have noticeably increased in recent months. Still, price is well ahead of all of this action. However, even if one holds the view that XRP is a buy based on their own fundamental framework, it's important to keep in mind that any position in XXRP should likely be expressing more of a technical bull setup than a fundamental one. Crypto is already a highly volatile sector of the market, and when you get into the altcoins that volatility can get more intense. Such is the case with XRP. Volatility XRP BTC ETH 30D 0.61 0.35 0.92 90D 1.08 0.54 0.94 1Yr 0.98 0.49 0.73 Source: Messari The table above shows the volatility metrics for XRP, BTC, and ETH over 30 Day, 90 day, and 1 year time frames. In all but one time frame, XRP is more volatile than ETH and XRP is more volatile than BTC in all three time frames shared. Closing Takeaways Essentially, XXRP is volatility on top of volatility. XRP is already a very volatile asset over just about any time frame that you look at. Factor in leverage from a fund like XXRP, and we're talking about a financial product that must be actively managed by the trader who holds it. This is not a product that should be held for longer than a few days, in my view. Thus, timing the buy properly is imperative. For investors who want exposure to XRP without leverage, they can consider the Volatility Shares XRP ETF ( XRPI ) as an alternative. That fund utilizes futures contracts without the leverage to mimic XRP returns and was launched the same day as XRPT.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4791075-xxrp-volatility-on-top-of-volatility?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","XRP-USD|XXRP",cryptocompare

The Act proposes comprehensive registration regimes to allow digital asset firms to operate legally within the U.S. market. Lawmakers emphasize the bill’s focus on consumer protection, innovation, and institutional clarity for investors and entrepreneurs. A long-awaited effort to bring order to the murky world of U.S. crypto regulation advanced on Thursday as Representative French Hill introduced the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025, also known as the CLARITY Act. The bill arrives with bipartisan support, including three Democratic co-sponsors, and seeks to finally resolve the jurisdictional tug-of-war between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The New Bipartisan Crypto Bill Seeks to End SEC-CFTC Turf War The 236-page bill is a successor to last year’s FIT21 legislation. While stablecoin regulation still leads the race to become the first comprehensive crypto law in the U.S., the CLARITY Act represents a major step forward in shaping broader crypto market structure rules. At its core, the bill gives the CFTC exclusive jurisdiction over digital commodity spot markets. These would be governed by new entities registered with the agency. Source: US Congress Crypto platforms would have the option to register with either the CFTC or the SEC, depending on whether they handle digital commodities like Bitcoin or securities, or both. “Our bill brings long-overdue clarity to the digital asset ecosystem and prioritizes consumer protection and American innovation,” said Representative Hill. “It builds off our work in the 118th Congress.” The legislation introduces comprehensive registration regimes, allowing crypto firms to legally operate in the U.S. It also lays out disclosure and compliance requirements for developers and intermediaries. These include detailed project disclosures, segregation of customer funds, and conflict-of-interest mitigation. “The CLARITY Act will deliver clear rules of the road that entrepreneurs, investors, and consumers deserve,” said Representative Ritchie Torres, one of the bill’s backers. Representative Dusty Johnson, who leads the agriculture subcommittee on digital assets, added: “America should be the global leader in the digital assets marketplace, but we can’t do that without establishing a clear regulatory framework.” U.S. Lawmakers Push Crypto Reform Bill Clarifying Custody, Stablecoin, and DeFi Oversight The bill covers long-disputed areas, including the regulation of custodians and decentralized finance (DeFi). It rejects the SEC’s prior attempt to require custody firms to hold customer assets on their own balance sheets. Instead, it sets a standard for “qualified digital asset custodians,” which would be defined by the CFTC based on federal, state, or foreign oversight. NEW: Chairman @RepFrenchHill today introduced the CLARITY Act, a bipartisan bill which would establish a regulatory framework for digital assets in the US. Read more https://t.co/fV7N7aXAdb pic.twitter.com/5ZIpFTcDDD — Financial Services GOP (@FinancialCmte) May 29, 2025 Some issues, like DeFi and NFTs, are deferred. The legislation tasks the SEC, CFTC, and the Treasury Department with studying these sectors and reporting back within a year. The Government Accountability Office is also directed to prepare reports on DeFi and NFTs. The bill explicitly exempts some decentralized wallet providers and DeFi platforms from SEC oversight. It also clarifies that payment stablecoins are not securities, placing regulatory authority with whichever agency already oversees the firm engaged in the activity. All told, the CLARITY Act sets a tight one-year timeline for regulators to write and implement the rules if the bill becomes law. That schedule is viewed by some as ambitious, especially given the complexities of financial regulation. Some provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act, passed in 2010, are still not finalized. NEW: US Digital Asset Market Structure bill, the CLARITY Act: 1. Clarifies CFTC vs. SEC (defining commodities & securities). 2. Unified federal licensing and registration regime. 3. Stablecoin and DeFI carve-outs. https://t.co/ZTosDCUudA pic.twitter.com/OTShEAebrn — Bitcoin Laws (@Bitcoin_Laws) May 29, 2025 Whether the House and Senate will align on crypto regulation is still unclear. The Senate is expected to resume debate next week on its stablecoin bill , which has made procedural progress but faces partisan concerns . Some lawmakers have floated the idea of combining the stablecoin and market structure bills , though such a move could complicate passage. President Donald Trump has pushed for both bills to reach his desk by the August congressional recess, but crypto insiders in Washington view that timeline as unlikely. For now, the bipartisan CLARITY Act gives lawmakers and regulators a new framework to work with and puts renewed pressure on Congress to end the longstanding confusion over crypto regulation in the United States.

The market is cooling off after weeks of upward momentum, and technical indicators like the Super Trend remain green but are starting to slow in bullish momentum. Ethereum Rejected at Resistance: Ethereum faced rejection from a major resistance zone once again, pulling its price down by over 3.6% in the past 24 hours to trade around $2,609. A slowing MACD on the 3-day timeframe also hints at weakening bullish momentum, raising concerns of a possible bearish crossover in the coming weeks. Altcoins Slip Into The Red Zone Solana (SOL) dropped by 4.79%, while Cardano (ADA) slipped 5.73%. Dogecoin (DOGE) also took a hit, falling 6.76%. BNB was down by 2.47%, and XRP declined by 3.37%. Even newer coins like Sui (SUI) weren’t spared, with a 4.06% dip.

2025-05-30T02:16:57.000Z,"Strategy Chair Michael Saylor Shares ‘21 Ways to Wealth’ in Vegas Keynote","LAS VEGAS, Nevada — Strategy (MSTR) Chair Michael Saylor waxed poetic about bitcoin in a keynote speech at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas on Thursday, laying out his guiding principles — his so-called “21 ways to wealth” — for a jam-packed audience of fans and conference-goers. “Satoshi started a fire in cyberspace, and while the fearful run from it and fools dance around it, the faithful feed the flame, dreaming of a better world, and bathe in the warm glow of cyberlight,” Saylor said. “What does that mean? It means that a lot of people that look at Bitcoin are going to be afraid of it. They'll never touch it. They'll never benefit from it. They'll be left behind. Then others will just juggle it. They will juggle the fire. They will make fireworks with the fire. They will create trinkets with the fire. They will create magic tricks with the fire. But those that truly understand it will feed the fire. How do you feed the fire? You feed the fire by buying Bitcoin. “ Saylor — who has taken on a near-mythic status in the bitcoin community for his leadership of Strategy, a publicly-traded technology company-turned-bitcoin treasury company, which holds approximately 3% of the total bitcoin supply — said that people should trade their other, inferior assets for bitcoin. “Take your fiat currency, trade it for bitcoin. Take your long term capital, trade it for bitcoin. Sell your bonds, trade [them] for Bitcoin. Sell your inferior equity, sell your inferior real estate property, buy bitcoin,” Saylor said. “Feed the fire, and what will come of that? An extraordinary explosion in the network and [in] the power of the network, and you will have bought your ticket to prosperity.” Thus was Saylor’s third way to wealth — courage — which he said meant that wealth “favors those who embrace intelligent monetary risk.” Bitcoin, like other assets, rises in price if more people buy it, though Saylor did not mention this effect during his speech. In addition to courage, Saylor advised the audience to have conviction in bitcoin’s potential, to stay committed to one cause, to cooperate with their families and children, to embrace artificial intelligence, to consider civility when engaging with the “natural power structures of the world,” and to remember to be generous. “When you are successful — and you will be successful — get up every morning and spread happiness, share security, and deliver hope to those less fortunate than you,” Saylor said. “You found the path first, you found the way first. You should spread good karma.”",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/29/strategy-chair-michael-saylor-shares-21-ways-to-wealth-in-vegas-keynote,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY","Markets|Michael Saylor|MicroStrategy|Strategy|News",cryptocompare

2025-05-30T02:05:42.000Z,"Bitcoin Receives Massive Strategic Boost as Tether Reinvests Billions","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Receives Massive Strategic Boost as Tether Reinvests Billions Get ready for some significant news from the stablecoin giant! Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin, USDT, is making waves with its investment strategy. The company’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, recently shared compelling details about how Tether is utilizing its substantial profits, and it involves a major focus on the leading cryptocurrency: Bitcoin . Tether’s Profitable Strategy: Reinvesting in Bitcoin Speaking at the highly anticipated Bitcoin 2025 conference, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino dropped a notable statistic: Tether has generated approximately $20 billion in profits over the past three years. This figure alone underscores the immense scale and success of Tether’s operations within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. What’s even more interesting is where these profits are going. According to reports from Odaily covering Ardoino’s comments, a surprisingly small portion—less than 5%—has been allocated to shareholder dividends. This indicates a strong preference for reinvestment back into the business and strategic assets rather than immediate payouts. The vast majority of these profits, the remaining 95%, are being channeled into two primary areas: Expanding Tether’s global distribution network Significant reinvestment in Bitcoin This clear emphasis on acquiring more Bitcoin with company profits signals a bullish stance from one of the most influential entities in the crypto market. It highlights Tether’s confidence not only in its own business model but also in the long-term value proposition of Bitcoin. Why is Tether Investing Heavily in Bitcoin ? Tether’s decision to allocate a large percentage of its profits towards Bitcoin isn’t entirely new, but the sheer scale revealed by Paolo Ardoino is noteworthy. Tether first publicly disclosed its Bitcoin holdings as part of its reserves in May 2023. At the time, they stated they would regularly allocate up to 15% of their net operating profits towards purchasing Bitcoin. This latest announcement suggests that the actual percentage of *total* profits (which would include operating profits, interest income from reserves, etc.) being directed into Bitcoin and growth initiatives is substantially higher than the previously stated 15% of *operating* profits. The $20 billion figure represents the total financial gain over three years. Several factors likely drive this strategy: Diversification: While Tether’s primary reserves back USDT and are largely held in safe, liquid assets like U.S. Treasury bills, allocating a portion of profits to Bitcoin adds a growth-oriented asset to their balance sheet. Potential Appreciation: Bitcoin has historically been a high-performing asset. Investing profits into BTC allows Tether to potentially grow its non-reserve holdings significantly if Bitcoin’s value increases. Alignment with the Crypto Ecosystem: As a cornerstone of the crypto market, holding Bitcoin aligns Tether with the broader digital asset landscape and demonstrates confidence in the technology it serves. Strategic Positioning: Large Bitcoin holdings can enhance Tether’s financial strength and strategic flexibility, separate from the assets specifically backing USDT redemptions. This approach allows Tether to benefit from Bitcoin’s potential upside while maintaining the stability and liquidity required to back the circulating supply of its stablecoin, USDT . Understanding Tether’s Profitability How does Tether generate such massive profits? The primary source of income for Tether comes from the interest earned on the reserves it holds to back the value of USDT . As the circulating supply of USDT has exploded, reaching tens of billions, the reserves have grown proportionally. A significant portion of these reserves is held in interest-bearing instruments, particularly short-term U.S. Treasury bills. With rising interest rates globally over the past few years, the income generated from these reserves has become substantial. This interest income forms a large part of the profits that Paolo Ardoino referenced. Additional revenue streams can include fees from minting/redeeming USDT, although interest income is typically the dominant factor. Here’s a simplified look at the profit allocation based on Ardoino’s statement: Profit Allocation (Past 3 Years) Approximate Amount (Based on $20B Total Profit) Percentage of Total Profit Shareholder Dividends Less than $1 billion Less than 5% Reinvestment (Global Distribution & Bitcoin ) More than $19 billion More than 95% This table clearly illustrates the strong bias towards reinvestment over immediate shareholder returns, a strategy that aligns with long-term growth objectives, including significant Crypto Investment . What Does This Mean for the Market and USDT Holders? Tether’s massive reinvestment strategy has several implications for the broader crypto market and for users of USDT : Potential Bitcoin Price Impact: Consistent, large-scale buying by an entity like Tether adds significant buying pressure to the Bitcoin market. While it’s difficult to isolate Tether’s exact impact, their accumulation is undoubtedly a bullish factor. Signal of Confidence: Tether’s willingness to hold substantial amounts of Bitcoin on its balance sheet sends a strong signal of confidence in Bitcoin’s future value and its role as a store of value. Tether’s Financial Strength: By reinvesting profits into potentially appreciating assets like Bitcoin, Tether can further strengthen its overall financial position, separate from the specific assets backing USDT . This could be seen as a positive for the long-term stability of the company, though it doesn’t directly impact the 1:1 peg of USDT, which is backed by specific reserve assets. Increased Scrutiny: Large holdings of volatile assets like Bitcoin, even if held separately from core reserves, may attract increased scrutiny from regulators, who are already focused on stablecoin reserves and operations. For holders of USDT , it’s crucial to remember that the assets backing the stablecoin’s peg are kept separate from Tether’s corporate profits and investments. The value of USDT remains tied to the stability and liquidity of its stated reserves, which are primarily in cash, cash equivalents, short-term deposits, and U.S. Treasury bills. The Bitcoin acquired with profits is part of Tether’s corporate treasury, not the direct backing for every USDT token. Challenges and Considerations While Tether’s aggressive Crypto Investment strategy, particularly into Bitcoin, highlights strong profitability and a bullish outlook, it’s not without potential challenges or points of consideration: Market Volatility: Holding large amounts of Bitcoin exposes Tether’s corporate treasury to the inherent volatility of the crypto market. While this doesn’t directly impact the USDT peg (as BTC is not a primary reserve asset for the peg), significant downturns could affect Tether’s overall financial statements and profitability in future periods. Transparency: While Tether has improved its reporting over the years, the exact timing and scale of their Bitcoin purchases from profits are not always immediately clear, which can lead to speculation. More detailed breakdowns of profit utilization could enhance transparency. Regulatory Environment: The regulatory landscape for stablecoins and crypto companies is constantly evolving. Tether’s significant market position and investment strategies are likely to remain under the microscope of regulators worldwide. Despite these points, the announcement from Paolo Ardoino underscores Tether’s position as a major financial force within the crypto space, capable of generating substantial profits and making significant strategic investments like buying billions in Bitcoin . Actionable Insights from Tether’s Crypto Investment What can investors take away from this news? Watch the Whales: Large entities like Tether making significant, consistent purchases of an asset like Bitcoin is often seen as a bullish indicator. Paying attention to the actions of major holders can provide insights into market sentiment and potential demand. Profitability in Crypto Infrastructure: Tether’s $20 billion profit figure over three years demonstrates the immense financial success achievable by companies providing essential infrastructure within the crypto market, like stablecoins. Diversification as a Strategy: Tether’s approach of diversifying a portion of its *profits* (separate from reserve assets) into growth assets like Bitcoin is a strategy employed by many corporations. While the specific assets differ, the principle of using excess capital for potential long-term growth is common. The Enduring Appeal of Bitcoin: Tether, an entity deeply embedded in the plumbing of crypto finance, continues to see Bitcoin as a valuable asset for its own balance sheet, reinforcing its perceived status as digital gold or a long-term store of value. This move solidifies Tether’s position not just as a stablecoin issuer but also as a significant corporate holder and accumulator of Bitcoin , actively using its financial success to strengthen its position and bet on the future of the leading cryptocurrency. Conclusion: Tether’s Big Bet on Bitcoin’s Future The revelation from Paolo Ardoino at Bitcoin 2025 that the bulk of Tether’s impressive $20 billion profits over the last three years is being plowed back into global expansion and, critically, into Bitcoin , is a major development. It signifies a deliberate and large-scale strategy by the world’s largest stablecoin issuer to deepen its holdings in the premier cryptocurrency. With only a small fraction going to dividends, the overwhelming focus is on growth and strategic asset accumulation. This substantial Crypto Investment by a key market player like Tether serves as a powerful signal, potentially influencing market sentiment and adding considerable buying pressure to Bitcoin. It underscores Tether’s robust profitability and its long-term confidence in Bitcoin’s enduring value, positioning them as a significant corporate whale in the BTC ocean.

2025-05-30T02:00:31.000Z,"Toncoin Open Interest Spikes 33%—Will History Repeat With A Pullback?","Data shows the Toncoin (TON) Open Interest has registered a spike in the past day. Here’s what could happen next, according to historical trends. Toncoin Open Interest Has Hit Its Highest Since February In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the latest trend in the Open Interest for Toncoin. The “Open Interest” here refers to a metric that keeps track of the total amount of perpetual futures positions related to TON (in USD) that are currently open on all derivatives platforms. When the value of this metric rises, it means the investors are opening up more positions related to the asset on the market. Generally, the total leverage in the sector goes up when new positions appear, so this kind of trend can lead to higher volatility for the cryptocurrency’s price. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Trapped Inside Triangle: 17% Move Incoming? On the other hand, the indicator going down suggests that investors are closing their own positions voluntarily or being forcibly liquidated by their exchange. Either way, the asset can behave in a more stable manner following such a trend due to the drop in leverage. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Toncoin Open Interest over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Toncoin Open Interest has just seen a very sharp spike, a sign that traders have opened up a large number of futures positions. More specifically, the metric’s value has gone up from $143 million to $190 million over the last 24 hours. From the chart, it’s visible that this quick 33% jump initially came as the coin’s price witnessed a rapid increase, but interestingly, it maintained its upward trajectory even as the asset saw a pullback. “Past spikes like this have often preceded corrections – worth watching closely,” notes Glassnode. The last time the Toncoin Open Interest formed this pattern was at the end of March/start of April. What followed back then was a price drawdown of about 32%. Related Reading: Ethereum May Be One Dip Away From Mass Losses—Data Warns TON isn’t the only digital asset that has seen an uptick in speculation recently. As the analytics firm has pointed out in its latest weekly report, Bitcoin has also been observing a major rise in its Open Interest. As is visible in the chart, the Bitcoin Open Interest fell to a low of $36.8 billion in April as the cryptocurrency’s price itself went down. Since then, however, the indicator has shot up by 51% alongside the bull rally, reaching the $55.6 billion mark. The report explains that this suggests “a build up of leverage is underway.” TON Price At the time of writing, Toncoin is trading around $3.34, up more than 11% in the last 24 hours.

2025-05-30T01:55:13.000Z,"Exclusive: Cantor Fitzgerald Unveils Revolutionary Bitcoin Fund with Gold Shield","BitcoinWorld Exclusive: Cantor Fitzgerald Unveils Revolutionary Bitcoin Fund with Gold Shield Exciting developments are unfolding in the world of institutional cryptocurrency adoption. Cantor Fitzgerald Asset Management, a major player in global financial services, is making a significant move with the planned launch of its first Bitcoin fund . This isn’t just any fund; it comes with a unique feature designed to appeal to cautious investors: downside protection linked to the price of gold. What Makes This Bitcoin Fund Unique? Cantor Fitzgerald’s approach stands out. While many funds offer direct exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements, this new five-year fund incorporates a protective mechanism. Here are the key features: Gold-Backed Protection: The fund offers 1-to-1 downside protection based on the price of gold. This means that for every dollar Bitcoin’s price might fall, the fund aims to offset that loss with a corresponding gain (or reduced loss) tied to gold’s performance. It’s important to note this isn’t physically backed by gold held by the fund, but rather uses financial instruments to achieve a correlation-based hedge. Upside Exposure: Investors still get exposure to the potential upside of Bitcoin’s price appreciation. No Cap on Gains: Unlike some structured products, the fund does not cap the potential profits from Bitcoin’s rise. Five-Year Term: It is structured as a five-year investment vehicle. Targeting Institutions: The fund is primarily aimed at institutional investors, reflecting the growing demand from this segment. This structure attempts to address one of the primary concerns investors have about Bitcoin: its volatility. By linking protection to gold, an asset traditionally seen as a safe haven and store of value, Cantor Fitzgerald is positioning this fund as a potentially less volatile way for institutions to gain crypto exposure. Expanding Institutional Access to Institutional Bitcoin Beyond the new fund, Cantor Fitzgerald is also significantly expanding its Bitcoin financing business. The firm reportedly has up to $2 billion available for institutional clients looking for financing solutions related to Bitcoin. This includes services like: Lending against Bitcoin holdings. Providing capital for Bitcoin-related businesses. Offering prime brokerage services for large crypto trades. This expansion signals Cantor Fitzgerald’s increasing commitment to the digital asset space and its belief in the long-term potential of institutional Bitcoin adoption. Providing robust financing options is crucial for institutions, as it allows them to manage liquidity, leverage positions, and execute complex strategies within the crypto market. Why the Interest in Gold-Backed Bitcoin ? The concept of pairing Bitcoin with gold might seem counterintuitive to some crypto enthusiasts who see Bitcoin as ‘digital gold.’ However, for traditional institutional investors, gold represents stability and a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty – qualities they are often seeking when diversifying portfolios. The inclusion of gold-backed Bitcoin protection in this fund is a strategic move by Cantor Fitzgerald to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the nascent crypto world. It offers a familiar concept (gold as a hedge) applied to a new, volatile asset (Bitcoin), potentially making it more palatable for risk-averse institutions or those bound by specific investment mandates. The correlation between Bitcoin and gold prices is not always consistent, and the effectiveness of this protection mechanism will depend on various market factors and the specific instruments used by the fund. However, the intent is clear: to mitigate the sharp downside risks associated with direct Bitcoin investment. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investment ? Cantor Fitzgerald’s move is another strong indicator of the maturing crypto investment landscape. As more reputable financial institutions like Cantor Fitzgerald enter the space with tailored products and services, it adds legitimacy and infrastructure necessary for broader institutional adoption. The availability of sophisticated financial products, like funds with built-in protection mechanisms and large-scale financing, lowers the barriers to entry for large firms previously hesitant due to volatility, regulatory uncertainty, or lack of infrastructure. This development could pave the way for other institutions to explore similar hybrid or protected crypto investment products. It highlights the demand for solutions that offer exposure to Bitcoin’s growth potential while addressing the inherent risks in ways that align with traditional finance risk management practices. While the fund is initially focused on institutions, the trend of established financial firms creating diverse crypto products ultimately benefits the entire ecosystem by increasing liquidity, improving market efficiency, and potentially leading to more accessible products for retail investors in the future. Looking Ahead: The Future of Institutional Crypto The actions of firms like Cantor Fitzgerald underscore a significant shift. We are moving beyond just buying and holding Bitcoin to building a comprehensive financial ecosystem around it. The availability of $2 billion in financing demonstrates the scale of capital now being directed towards the sector by major financial players. This infrastructure is vital for the next phase of growth, enabling everything from complex trading strategies to funding for innovation within the blockchain space. Challenges remain, including regulatory clarity and operational complexities. However, the commitment shown by firms like Cantor Fitzgerald suggests that institutions are actively working through these challenges to participate in what they see as a significant opportunity. The blend of traditional assets (like the gold link) with digital assets (Bitcoin) in new financial products is likely a trend we will see continue as the lines between traditional finance and decentralized finance (DeFi) continue to blur. Cantor Fitzgerald’s new fund and expanded financing are important steps in making crypto more accessible and manageable for large investors, potentially driving further capital into the market and solidifying Bitcoin’s position as a recognized asset class within the global financial system.

2025-05-30T01:53:34.000Z,"Silk Road Founder Ross Ulbricht to Bitcoiners: ‘Freedom is Worth the Struggle’","LAS VEGAS, Nevada — Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht has a message for the crypto community: if you want to maintain your freedom, you must remain unified and decentralized, and you must be prepared for a struggle. In a heart-felt keynote speech closing out Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas on Thursday, Ulbricht, addressing the public in-person for the first time since being released from prison in January, shared a story to illustrate his three guiding principles — freedom, decentralization and unity. Ulbricht explained that, in the early days of the Silk Road, he wanted to grow hallucinogenic mushrooms to stock the darknet marketplace with, so he rented a remote cabin. The cabin, he said, was infested with wasps. He set out to deal with the wasps, using a trick his father had taught him that involved trapping the wasps’ nests under a towel. “My heart was pounding,” Ulbricht said. “I selected the nest that was furthest from the others, because I didn’t know if the other nests would come and sting me, spread out the towel, got as close as I could — ready to flee if I had to — but when I wrapped up the nest, nothing happened. It was as if the other wasps didn’t even notice.” Ulbricht said that the wasps were strong because they were free: “It was impossible to keep track of so many individual wasps, a sting could come from any direction. They were strong because they were decentralized, across seven nests.\"" But, Ulbricht said, the wasps were ultimately weak because they were not unified, and did not react when their fellow wasps were taken down. “Had a single wasp dared to come sting me when I reached for that first nest, I would have fled … but they didn’t. Thank god you are not wasps,” Ulbricht said. Before being pardoned by U.S. President Donald Trump in January — the result of a promise Trump made on the campaign trail in 2024 — Ulbricht spent 12 years behind bars. His speech on Thursday marked the 10-year anniversary, to the day, of a New York judge sentencing the then-31-year-old Ulbricht to two life sentences, plus 40 years, for owning and operating the dark net marketplace. During his keynote speech, Ulbricht, who has been free for four months, still seemed buoyant with his newfound freedom. In a video montage ahead of his appearance on stage, clips of Ulbricht experiencing life outside prison — traveling, surfing, spending time with his wife — played on screen, each showing a beaming Ulbricht. “Winning your freedom feels as amazing as losing it feels awful,” Ulbricht said, crediting the crypto community for advocating for his release. “I’m free, and it’s because of you. You made this moment possible…Thank you, thank you, thank you.” After more than a decade behind bars, Ulbricht likened himself to Rip van Winkle, admitting that he was overwhelmed with all the technological advancements since he went to prison. “There are dozens of new cryptocurrencies and blockchains, each one fascinating in its own right, and thousands more I'll never have time to learn about. There's DeFi and Web3 and AI to help me navigate it all. It's nuts,” Ulbricht said. “I mean, just a few months ago, when I walked out of prison, I'd never seen a drone … It's all hitting me at once, freedom, the new technology, the fact that I have a future again.” Ulbricht closed by telling the audience about gangs and factions in prison, saying that he quickly came to understand that the prison wardens like inmates to be divided. “The only times I saw the wardens show respect to the prisoners was when we were united,” Ulbricht said. “Those that oppose decentralization and freedom love it when we’re divided, I promise you, so stay united. So long as we can agree that we deserve freedom, and that decentralization is how we secure it, then we can be united…stay true to these principles and the future is ours.”",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/05/29/silk-road-founder-ross-ulbricht-to-bitcoiners-freedom-is-worth-the-struggle,"BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY","Policy|Ross Ulbricht|News",cryptocompare
2025-05-30T01:45:20.000Z,"Critical Move: SEC’s Hester Peirce Suggests Meme Coin Regulatory Committee","BitcoinWorld Critical Move: SEC’s Hester Peirce Suggests Meme Coin Regulatory Committee The world of cryptocurrency is constantly evolving, bringing forth innovative, and sometimes perplexing, digital assets. Among the most talked-about recent phenomena are meme coins – cryptocurrencies often born from internet jokes, cultural trends, or community enthusiasm, rather than traditional business models or clear utility. Their explosive growth and unique characteristics have presented a significant challenge for existing financial regulations worldwide. This challenge was front and center at the recent Bitcoin 2025 Conference , where U.S. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce offered some intriguing insights and a potential path forward for navigating the complex landscape of SEC Meme Coin Regulation . Hester Peirce Crypto Insights: A Call for Clarity Known affectionately in the crypto community as “Crypto Mom” for her often more accommodating stance towards digital assets compared to some of her peers, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce has consistently advocated for clearer regulatory frameworks that foster innovation rather than stifle it. Her comments at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference underscored this perspective, specifically addressing the unique nature of meme coins. Peirce noted that meme coins, in many ways, resemble collectibles. Think of digital baseball cards, unique digital art pieces, or other items whose value is primarily driven by cultural significance, community sentiment, and scarcity rather than an underlying business venture or expectation of profit derived from the efforts of others (a key component of the Howey Test used to define a security in the U.S.). Her crucial point was that these assets, due to their nature, currently appear to fall outside the conventional protections offered by securities laws. This creates a significant gap, leaving investors potentially exposed without the disclosure requirements and anti-fraud provisions typically applied to securities. Why a Crypto Regulatory Committee for Meme Coins? The core of Commissioner Peirce’s suggestion is the establishment of a dedicated Crypto Regulatory Committee specifically focused on meme coins. But why is such a specialized body needed? Here are some reasons: Unique Characteristics: Meme coins often lack whitepapers, clear roadmaps, or identifiable development teams in the traditional sense. Their value is heavily reliant on community hype and social media trends. Investor Protection: Without securities law protections, investors are more vulnerable to pump-and-dump schemes, market manipulation, and misleading promotions. Regulatory Ambiguity: Applying existing securities frameworks, designed for traditional stocks and bonds, to assets like Dogecoin or Shiba Inu is challenging and can lead to uncertainty. Rapid Evolution: The meme coin space moves incredibly fast, with new tokens emerging daily. Regulators need a focused approach to keep pace. Global Nature: Meme coins trade on global platforms, requiring a coordinated or at least well-considered domestic approach that considers international implications. A dedicated committee could bring together experts to study these unique assets, understand their market dynamics, and propose tailored regulatory approaches that don’t necessarily fit the mold of traditional securities regulation. Navigating the Challenges of Meme Coin Regulation Regulating meme coins is no simple task. The proposed Meme Coin Regulation committee would face numerous hurdles: Defining ‘Meme Coin’: How do you legally define a meme coin versus other cryptocurrencies or digital assets? The line can be blurry. Decentralization: Many meme coins claim a degree of decentralization, making it hard to identify responsible parties for regulatory compliance. Valuation Challenges: Traditional valuation metrics don’t apply. Value is highly speculative and sentiment-driven. Balancing Innovation and Protection: Overly strict regulation could stifle the organic, community-driven innovation that characterizes this space, while insufficient rules leave investors exposed. Jurisdictional Issues: Trading is global, while regulation is typically national. The committee would need to grapple with these fundamental questions to develop effective and fair rules. Potential Structure and Focus of a Meme Coin Regulatory Committee While Commissioner Peirce’s suggestion was high-level, one can envision the potential structure and focus areas for such a committee. It might include representatives from: The SEC Other relevant financial regulatory bodies (CFTC, FinCEN) Academic experts in digital assets and economics Potentially, representatives from the crypto industry (though this could be controversial) Their work could involve: Area of Focus Potential Activities Classification Developing criteria to distinguish meme coins from securities or other asset classes. Disclosure Exploring alternative disclosure requirements suitable for assets without traditional financials. Market Integrity Studying mechanisms to detect and prevent manipulation specific to meme coin markets. Investor Education Developing resources to help potential investors understand the unique risks of meme coins. Enforcement Identifying clear triggers and methods for enforcement actions against fraudulent activities. The goal would be to create a framework that provides necessary investor protections without trying to fit a square peg into the round hole of existing securities law designed for different types of assets. The Broader Context: Crypto Regulation in the US Commissioner Peirce’s proposal comes at a time when the U.S. is actively debating the future of crypto regulation. The SEC, under Chair Gary Gensler, has largely pursued an enforcement-first approach, classifying many cryptocurrencies as securities and taking action against platforms and projects they deem non-compliant. This approach has drawn criticism from many in the industry, including Commissioner Peirce, who argue it lacks clarity and hinders innovation. The suggestion for a specific committee for meme coins highlights the difficulty in applying a one-size-fits-all approach to the diverse crypto ecosystem. It acknowledges that assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, utility tokens, stablecoins, and meme coins may require different regulatory considerations. The discussions at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference , a major gathering for the crypto community, provide a crucial platform for these ideas to be debated and potentially influence future policy directions. Peirce’s willingness to engage with the community and propose specific solutions like a Crypto Regulatory Committee is seen by many as a positive step towards finding pragmatic regulatory solutions. What Does This Mean for Investors and the Market? For investors, the prospect of clearer Meme Coin Regulation could bring both pros and cons. On the one hand, increased regulatory clarity and potential protections against fraud could boost confidence and potentially attract a wider range of participants to the market. On the other hand, any form of regulation could be seen by some as interfering with the free-wheeling, speculative nature that attracts many to meme coins in the first place. For the market as a whole, a dedicated committee could signal a more nuanced and thoughtful approach from regulators towards specific crypto asset classes. It could potentially pave the way for tailored rules that acknowledge the unique characteristics of meme coins rather than forcing them into unsuitable existing categories. Looking Ahead: The Future of Meme Coin Regulation Commissioner Peirce’s suggestion is just that – a suggestion. Whether a dedicated Crypto Regulatory Committee for meme coins is ultimately established remains to be seen. However, her comments at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference serve as a vital acknowledgment from within the SEC that meme coins present a unique regulatory challenge that needs a specific, thoughtful approach. Addressing the regulatory gap is essential for fostering a mature and safe digital asset market. Whether through a dedicated committee or other means, clearer guidance on how assets like meme coins are viewed and regulated in the U.S. is crucial for investors, developers, and the industry’s future growth. The conversation has been started, and the path towards effective SEC Meme Coin Regulation is likely to be a long and complex one. Summary At the Bitcoin 2025 Conference, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce highlighted that meme coins resemble collectibles and currently lack securities law protections. She proposed creating a dedicated Meme Coin Regulatory Committee to address this gap, acknowledging the unique challenges these assets pose. This suggestion signals a potential shift towards more tailored regulatory approaches for specific crypto categories, aiming to enhance investor protection and market clarity while navigating the complexities of these community-driven, often speculative assets. The path to effective meme coin regulation is challenging but necessary for the evolving digital asset landscape.

2025-05-30T01:42:14.000Z,"Crypto Market News: XRP Price Prediction Today","The post Crypto Market News: XRP Price Prediction Today appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As June 2025 approaches, XRP continues to show mixed signals in the market. The cryptocurrency has recently been in a short-term pullback, moving slightly lower after previous gains. This type of movement is common in crypto markets, especially since XRP often mirrors Bitcoin’s price action. Current Price Movement At the moment, XRP has dropped below a key support level between $2.30 and $2.34. This breakdown means the price could fall further towards the next major support zone around $2.10 to $2.15. If selling pressure increases, XRP might test even lower areas — but holding above these support levels would be a positive sign for the bulls. XRP has important support between $2.10 and $2.15. A drop below this could push the price down to $1.79, which is a very important level to hold. If it falls under $1.79, bigger losses could follow. On the other hand, XRP faces resistance between $2.30 and $2.34. If the price moves above this, the next hurdles are at $2.44, and then between $2.56 and $2.62. Possible Bullish Pattern Forming There’s a chance that XRP might be forming a classic chart pattern called an “inverse head and shoulders.” This is a bullish (positive) sign that often hints at a price rise. But right now, this pattern isn’t confirmed yet. For this pattern to become official, XRP’s price would need to bounce from its current levels, move up towards the $2.62 mark, and break through it. If that happens in the next couple of weeks, it could spark a strong upward move — maybe even towards new all-time highs. What Could Happen Next? In the short term (next few days to a week), experts expect XRP’s price to continue cooling off while Bitcoin remains quiet. The key is whether XRP can hold above $2.10 or especially $1.79, as dropping below these levels might bring more selling pressure. If bulls (buyers) step in soon, it might see a bounce back before XRP hits those lower levels. On the flip side, if sellers stay in control, the price could dip a little more before finding strong support.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/crypto-market-news-xrp-price-prediction-for-june-2025/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

2025-05-30T01:20:36.000Z,"US Court Ruling: Crucial Precedent from Trade Court Impacts Regulatory Environment","BitcoinWorld US Court Ruling: Crucial Precedent from Trade Court Impacts Regulatory Environment While headlines often focus on direct news within the cryptocurrency world – be it price movements, technological advancements, or specific regulatory actions targeting digital assets – it’s vital to remember that the broader legal and economic landscape significantly influences this nascent industry. A recent development, specifically a US Court Ruling in Washington, D.C., referencing a prior Trade Court Ruling , might seem distant from crypto at first glance, but it underscores principles of law, government action, and judicial oversight that are profoundly relevant to the Regulatory Environment crypto navigates. Let’s dive into why this seemingly unrelated court reference holds importance for anyone tracking the future of digital assets and regulated markets. Understanding the US Court Ruling and its Context According to reports, the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., made a notable reference to an earlier decision by the U.S. Court of International Trade. While specific details regarding the case before the Washington D.C. court remain largely undisclosed at this time, the reference points back to a significant legal challenge concerning Government Policy – specifically, the halting of a reciprocal tariff policy enacted by the previous administration. This reference is more than just a procedural note; it signifies how legal precedents set in one area of law can be considered and applied in others. The original Trade Court Ruling was a landmark decision that challenged the executive branch’s authority in implementing certain trade measures, asserting the judiciary’s role in reviewing such actions. The fact that a different U.S. District Court is now referencing this decision suggests its principles are being considered relevant in other legal contexts, potentially broadening its impact beyond international trade disputes. What Was the Original Trade Court Ruling About? To grasp the significance of the Washington D.C. court’s reference, we need to understand the original Trade Court Ruling . This decision stemmed from challenges against a specific tariff policy. Here are some key aspects, based on public reporting about the original case: The Policy: The case involved tariffs imposed under specific statutory authority, often related to national security or trade imbalances. The Challenge: Plaintiffs, typically importers or affected businesses, argued that the implementation of these tariffs exceeded the executive branch’s delegated authority or failed to follow proper legal procedures. The Ruling: The U.S. Court of International Trade sided with the plaintiffs, at least in part, ruling that the administration had overstepped its bounds or improperly applied the law in imposing the tariffs. This ruling effectively halted the implementation of the specific reciprocal tariff policy in question. The Principle: At its core, the ruling was an assertion of Judicial Review – the power of courts to review the constitutionality or legality of actions taken by the legislative and executive branches of government. This original ruling was a significant check on executive power in the realm of trade, demonstrating that even policies enacted under broad statutory language are subject to legal challenge and judicial oversight. Why Does This US Court Ruling Matter for the Regulatory Environment? Now, let’s connect these dots back to the Regulatory Environment , which is of paramount concern to the cryptocurrency community. The crypto space is currently grappling with significant uncertainty regarding how existing laws apply to digital assets and whether new regulations are needed. Various government agencies – from the SEC and CFTC to the Treasury and Congress – are actively discussing or pursuing different approaches to oversight. This US Court Ruling , by referencing a significant Trade Court Ruling on Government Policy , highlights several crucial points relevant to crypto: Judicial Review is a Check on Power: The principle of Judicial Review means that government agencies, including those regulating or seeking to regulate crypto, are not beyond the reach of the law. Their interpretations of statutes, the procedures they follow, and the scope of the rules they propose can all be challenged in court. Precedent Matters: Court decisions, especially those from federal courts, create precedents. While a ruling on trade tariffs isn’t directly about Bitcoin, the legal reasoning employed by the court regarding the limits of executive authority, the interpretation of statutes, or the requirements for administrative action can be cited in future cases involving other government policies, including those targeting digital assets. Clarity Through Litigation: Sometimes, the precise boundaries of Government Policy and regulatory authority are only truly defined through legal challenges. This is a path the crypto industry is already navigating, with ongoing lawsuits against regulatory bodies seeking clarity on whether certain tokens are securities, the scope of exchange oversight, and other critical issues. Impact on Market Certainty: Legal challenges and the potential for judicial intervention can introduce uncertainty, but they can also, over time, lead to greater clarity regarding the rules of the road. A clear Regulatory Environment is something the crypto market desperately needs to foster innovation and attract mainstream adoption. Rulings like the referenced Trade Court Ruling , even in a different sector, contribute to the overall body of law that defines how government interacts with industry. Think of it this way: If a court rules that a government agency overstepped its authority in imposing tariffs based on a certain interpretation of a law, that ruling’s reasoning might be relevant if another agency is accused of overstepping its authority in regulating crypto based on a similar broad interpretation of a different law. Navigating the Complexities: Challenges and Perspectives The interplay between Government Policy , the Regulatory Environment , and Judicial Review is complex. There are differing perspectives on the appropriate role of each branch of government: Advocates for Strong Executive/Agency Power: Argue that agencies have the necessary expertise and are best positioned to respond quickly to rapidly evolving areas like technology and finance. They may view extensive judicial intervention as hindering effective governance. Advocates for Judicial Oversight: Emphasize the importance of checks and balances. They believe courts play a crucial role in ensuring that government actions stay within the bounds set by statutes and the Constitution, protecting individuals and industries from arbitrary or unlawful power. Industry Perspective (including Crypto): Often seeks clear, predictable rules. While some in crypto may chafe under regulation, many recognize that a lack of clarity is detrimental. They watch court cases closely, hoping for decisions that provide certainty and fairness, ensuring that regulations are applied correctly and don’t stifle innovation unnecessarily. The Washington D.C. court’s reference to the Trade Court Ruling is a small piece of this larger puzzle, illustrating how judicial challenges to Government Policy are an ongoing feature of the U.S. legal system and contribute to shaping the overall Regulatory Environment . Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community Given the indirect but relevant implications of this US Court Ruling and the underlying Trade Court Ruling , what should those interested in crypto take away? 1. Pay Attention to Legal Precedents Beyond Crypto: Don’t limit your focus only to court cases explicitly involving Bitcoin or blockchain. Rulings in areas like administrative law, securities law (even outside of crypto), and challenges to government agency actions (like the tariff case) can set precedents or offer insights into legal arguments that may eventually be applied to digital assets. 2. Understand the Principle of Judicial Review: Recognize that legal challenges are a legitimate and important part of shaping the Regulatory Environment . Support for organizations or efforts that advocate for clear, fair regulation and are willing to pursue legal avenues when necessary can be impactful. 3. Stay Informed on Government Policy Trends: The tariff case is an example of how broad Government Policy can be subject to legal challenge. Keep an eye on proposed legislation and regulatory rules related to crypto, understanding that these too can be challenged in court. 4. Advocate for Clarity: Engage with policymakers and regulators where possible, stressing the need for a clear and consistent Regulatory Environment for digital assets. Highlight how legal uncertainty hinders legitimate activity while potentially pushing bad actors underground. 5. Recognize the Long Game: Establishing a stable and predictable Regulatory Environment for crypto will likely be a multi-year process involving legislative efforts, regulatory rulemaking, and significant court battles. Developments like this US Court Ruling are reminders that the legal system moves deliberately, but its decisions have lasting effects. Conclusion: Why Legal Watchfulness is Key While a US Court Ruling referencing a Trade Court Ruling on tariffs might not generate the same buzz as a Bitcoin price surge or a major exchange listing, it’s a critical reminder of the foundational legal principles that govern government action and shape the Regulatory Environment . The principle of Judicial Review , the power of legal precedent, and the constant negotiation between Government Policy and judicial oversight are all highly relevant to the ongoing development and regulation of the cryptocurrency industry. Staying informed about legal developments, even those outside the immediate crypto bubble, provides valuable context and helps anticipate potential challenges and pathways towards regulatory clarity. The reference by the Washington D.C. court serves as a small but significant signal that the legal principles tested in cases like the original Trade Court Ruling continue to resonate throughout the U.S. judicial system, influencing the legal landscape that industries like crypto must navigate.

2025-05-30T01:10:48.000Z,"Solana Treasury: Sol Strategies Makes Epic $100M Commitment","BitcoinWorld Solana Treasury: Sol Strategies Makes Epic $100M Commitment In a move that has captured significant attention within the cryptocurrency space, Sol Strategies recently announced a dramatic shift in its corporate treasury strategy. This isn’t just a minor adjustment; it’s a complete pivot, signaling strong conviction in the future of a specific blockchain ecosystem. The decision involves exiting a long-held position in one of crypto’s giants to go all-in on another. Understanding the Bold Solana Treasury Shift At the heart of the news is Sol Strategies’ decision to fully allocate its treasury assets to Solana (SOL). Previously holding a position in Bitcoin (BTC), the company has now liquidated its entire Bitcoin holdings to acquire a substantial amount of SOL. Specifically, Sol Strategies announced via a post on X (formerly Twitter) that it purchased 26,478 SOL for $4.7 million. This acquisition brings their total Solana treasury holdings to a staggering 420,355 SOL. To put this into perspective, based on recent market valuations, this Solana treasury is estimated to be worth approximately CAD $100 million. This isn’t pocket change; it represents a significant corporate asset base now solely tied to the performance and growth of the Solana network. Why the Bitcoin Exit? The decision to execute a complete Bitcoin exit from their treasury is perhaps as noteworthy as the move into Solana. For many companies holding crypto on their balance sheets, Bitcoin has been the default, perceived as the safest and most established digital asset. Sol Strategies’ departure from this common practice suggests a strategic re-evaluation of their long-term asset management goals and a potentially higher conviction in the growth trajectory and utility offered by the Solana ecosystem compared to Bitcoin for their specific objectives. Sol Strategies’ Vision: More Than Just a SOL Investment Sol Strategies explicitly stated that this massive SOL investment is not merely a speculative play on the price of Solana. The company articulated a clear rationale rooted in a long-term commitment to the Solana ecosystem . A key part of their strategy involves supporting validator growth within the network. By holding and potentially staking such a large amount of SOL, Sol Strategies can play a significant role in the network’s security, decentralization, and overall health. This suggests a belief in Solana’s technology, its development community, and its potential to scale and handle widespread adoption. Here’s a quick look at the key figures: Previous Treasury Asset: Bitcoin (BTC) New Treasury Asset: Solana (SOL) Recent Acquisition: 26,478 SOL Cost of Acquisition: $4.7 million Total SOL Holdings: 420,355 SOL Estimated Value of Treasury: ~CAD $100 million Stated Goal: Long-term commitment, support validator growth What Does This Mean for the Solana Ecosystem? A treasury move of this magnitude from a known entity like Sol Strategies can have several implications for the Solana ecosystem : Increased Confidence: It can signal strong institutional or corporate confidence in Solana’s technology and future prospects, potentially encouraging other investors. Validator Growth Support: By dedicating significant capital to SOL holdings, Sol Strategies can contribute to the network’s security and decentralization through staking, aligning their financial interests with the network’s operational success. Market Sentiment: Large, publicly announced purchases can positively influence market sentiment around SOL. Potential for Further Development: A company deeply invested in the ecosystem is more likely to participate in or fund further development and innovation on Solana. Is a Full Treasury Allocation Risky? While the move signals strong conviction, allocating an entire treasury to a single, volatile asset like SOL does come with inherent risks. Cryptocurrency markets are known for their price swings, and concentrating assets removes the diversification benefits that holding multiple assets (like Bitcoin and others) might offer. However, Sol Strategies’ focus on validator growth suggests they may be looking beyond short-term price movements and are focused on the yield and network participation benefits that come with staking. Looking Ahead: Sol Strategies and the Solana Treasury Sol Strategies’ decision is a bold statement in the evolving landscape of corporate crypto treasury management. It moves away from the more common diversified or Bitcoin-centric approaches and places a significant bet on Solana’s continued growth and success. The outcome of this strategy will be closely watched, not only by those interested in Sol Strategies’ performance but also by the broader crypto community keen to see how such a concentrated, ecosystem-focused treasury performs over the long term and what impact it has on the Solana ecosystem itself. This development highlights a growing trend where companies are not just holding crypto but are strategically aligning their assets with specific blockchain ecosystems they believe will drive future innovation and value.

2025-05-30T01:00:55.000Z,"Peter Schiff Bitcoin Claims: Is Gold Truly the Only Reserve Asset?","BitcoinWorld Peter Schiff Bitcoin Claims: Is Gold Truly the Only Reserve Asset? Veteran gold advocate and renowned Bitcoin skeptic, Peter Schiff, recently stirred the pot by attending the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. His presence alone was noteworthy, but it was his outspoken commentary that truly grabbed headlines, reigniting the fiery Peter Schiff Bitcoin debate. Schiff didn’t hold back, leveling sharp criticisms against the leading cryptocurrency and firmly reiterating his long-held belief that only gold holds the status of a true reserve asset. What Exactly Did Peter Schiff Claim About Bitcoin? Schiff, the CEO of Euro Pacific Capital, used the platform not to praise Bitcoin, but to dismantle its perceived value and purpose. His core arguments, as stated during or around the conference, were pointed and direct: No Intrinsic Value: Schiff asserted that Bitcoin is an asset devoid of intrinsic value. Unlike commodities or productive assets, he argues, Bitcoin doesn’t inherently produce anything or have a physical use case beyond speculation. This lack of inherent worth, in his view, means it cannot create real wealth in the traditional sense. A ‘Giant Cult’: Perhaps his most provocative claim was labeling the Bitcoin community a “giant cult.” This suggests a group bound by fervent, perhaps irrational, belief rather than fundamental value or logic. Not a Technological Innovation: Countering a common narrative, Schiff dismissed Bitcoin as a significant technological breakthrough, instead comparing its structure and market dynamics to that of a meme coin – assets often driven purely by hype and community sentiment rather than underlying technology or utility. Gold is the ONLY True Reserve Asset: Schiff doubled down on his stance that gold is the unparalleled store of value and the sole true reserve asset. He cited the continued purchasing of gold by central banks globally as evidence supporting this claim, contrasting it sharply with their lack of significant Bitcoin holdings. These statements underscore the fundamental divide between gold bugs like Schiff and the burgeoning cryptocurrency world. For Schiff, Bitcoin’s value is purely speculative, a bubble waiting to burst, while gold’s value is timeless, proven by millennia of history and its tangible nature. Exploring the Core of the Bitcoin Intrinsic Value Debate The concept of Bitcoin intrinsic value is a central point of contention. For traditional investors like Schiff, intrinsic value is often tied to physical properties, utility, or the ability to generate future cash flows (like a stock). Gold has industrial uses, serves as jewelry, and has a long history as a medium of exchange and store of value. Bitcoin proponents argue that its value isn’t ‘intrinsic’ in the traditional sense, but derived from other crucial factors: Decentralization: Its independence from central authorities makes it censorship-resistant and a hedge against traditional financial system risks. Scarcity: The hard cap of 21 million coins creates digital scarcity, a key driver of value, similar to how the limited supply of gold contributes to its value. Network Effect: The growing number of users, developers, and businesses built around Bitcoin increases its utility and security. Security: The robust proof-of-work mechanism makes the network incredibly secure against attacks. Utility as Digital Gold/Store of Value: In a digital age, Bitcoin offers a way to store and transfer value across borders without intermediaries, acting as a digital alternative to gold. While Bitcoin lacks physical form or industrial use, its value proposition lies in its unique digital properties and the robust network supporting it. The debate hinges on whether these digital attributes constitute a form of ‘intrinsic’ or fundamental value in the 21st century. Is the Bitcoin Community a ‘Giant Cult’? Addressing the Bitcoin Cult Claim Schiff’s description of the community as a Bitcoin cult is undoubtedly inflammatory. While the term ‘cult’ typically implies blind devotion, manipulative leadership, and isolation from reality, the Bitcoin community is characterized by passionate belief, strong evangelism, and a shared vision for a decentralized future. Similar to early adopters of any revolutionary technology or movement, Bitcoin enthusiasts often display deep conviction and are eager to convert others. They pore over technical details, debate economic theories, and actively participate in promoting adoption. This passion can sometimes be perceived as cult-like by outsiders, especially given the asset’s volatility and the strong conviction many holders have in its long-term success despite setbacks. However, comparing it directly to a harmful cult ignores the open, decentralized nature of the community, the lack of a single leader, and the fact that participation is voluntary and based on investment thesis or ideological alignment rather than coercive control. While pockets of extreme views or toxic behavior exist, labeling the entire global community a ‘cult’ is a broad generalization that many find unfair and dismissive. Bitcoin vs Gold: The Ultimate Reserve Asset Showdown The core of Schiff’s argument and a perpetual topic of discussion is the Bitcoin vs Gold comparison. For centuries, gold has been the go-to asset during times of economic uncertainty, held by individuals and nations alike as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. Its status as a Gold reserve asset is well-established. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a newcomer, only gaining prominence in the last decade. Its proponents argue it possesses properties that make it superior to gold in the digital age. Let’s look at a comparison: Feature Gold Bitcoin Intrinsic Value (Traditional View) Yes (Physical, Industrial, Jewelry) Debatable (Digital Utility, Network Effect) Scarcity Finite (Mining is difficult but supply increases) Absolutely Finite (Hard cap of 21 million) Portability Difficult (Heavy, requires security) Easy (Digital, can be sent anywhere instantly) Divisibility Difficult (Cutting/melting) Easy (Divisible up to 8 decimal places – satoshis) Verifiability Requires expertise/equipment Easy (Blockchain transparency) Storage Cost/Security Requires secure vaults, insurance Requires digital security (wallets, keys) Historical Precedent as Money/Store of Value Thousands of years ~15 years Central Bank Adoption as Reserve Asset Widespread and increasing Minimal (Some exploration/discussion) Volatility Relatively low High While gold has the advantage of history and stability, Bitcoin excels in areas like portability, divisibility, and transparency in the digital realm. The debate isn’t just about which is better, but whether Bitcoin can carve out its own role as a digital store of value or even a future reserve asset alongside, or perhaps eventually challenging, gold. Why Do Central Banks Still Prefer Gold? Schiff correctly points out that central banks are currently buying gold, not Bitcoin. This preference for Gold reserve asset status among national banks stems from several factors: History and Trust: Gold has been a trusted store of value and medium of exchange for millennia. Central banks have vast experience managing gold reserves. Stability and Liquidity: While not immune to price swings, gold is generally less volatile than Bitcoin and has deep, established global markets for trading. Regulatory Clarity: The legal and regulatory framework around holding and managing gold is well-defined internationally. Bitcoin, conversely, faces significant regulatory uncertainty in many jurisdictions. Physical Control: Central banks can physically hold and secure their gold reserves within their borders, offering a sense of direct control that differs from holding digital assets distributed globally. However, the landscape is slowly evolving. Some central banks and international bodies are exploring digital currencies (CBDCs) and the potential implications of decentralized cryptocurrencies. While mass adoption of Bitcoin as a central bank reserve asset isn’t imminent, the conversation is no longer entirely off the table for some forward-thinking institutions. Actionable Insights for Investors What should investors take away from the ongoing Peter Schiff Bitcoin vs. Gold debate? Do Your Own Research: Don’t rely solely on the opinions of one person, whether they are a gold bug or a Bitcoin maximalist. Understand the fundamentals of both assets. Consider Diversification: Many investors choose to hold both gold and Bitcoin as part of a diversified portfolio, leveraging the unique characteristics of each. Understand Your Risk Tolerance: Bitcoin is significantly more volatile than gold. Assess how much risk you are comfortable taking. Long-Term Perspective: Both gold and Bitcoin are often viewed as long-term stores of value. Consider your investment horizon. Schiff’s criticisms, while harsh, highlight legitimate questions about Bitcoin’s valuation and role. However, they often overlook the innovative aspects and growing adoption that make Bitcoin a compelling asset for many in the digital age. Conclusion: An Unending Debate Peter Schiff’s appearance at the Bitcoin 2025 conference and his subsequent remarks served as a stark reminder of the ideological chasm separating traditional finance advocates and the cryptocurrency world. His claims of Bitcoin having no Bitcoin intrinsic value , being a ‘giant cult,’ and his insistence on gold as the sole Gold reserve asset are consistent with his long-held views. While Schiff’s criticisms resonate with those skeptical of digital assets, they fail to fully capture the arguments for Bitcoin’s value derived from its decentralized network, absolute scarcity, and growing utility as a digital store of value. The Bitcoin vs Gold debate is far from over, reflecting differing views on what constitutes value and security in the modern economy. Ultimately, the choice between Bitcoin, gold, or a combination of both depends on an individual investor’s financial goals, risk appetite, and belief in the future trajectory of both traditional and digital assets. Schiff’s comments, though controversial, contribute to a necessary dialogue about the nature of money and value in the 21st century.

2025-05-30T01:00:52.000Z,"Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Lock In Gains: Data Suggests The Bull Trend Remains Intact","Bitcoin is approaching a pivotal moment as it consolidates just below the $110,000 mark, holding strong while flirting with the possibility of a breakout. After weeks of steady upward momentum, BTC is now facing a key resistance zone that could determine the next phase of its bull cycle. Despite rising macroeconomic uncertainty and global tensions—from trade conflicts to shifting interest rate expectations—Bitcoin appears to be thriving in this environment. As traditional markets show signs of stress, demand for hard digital assets like BTC continues to rise. On-chain data further supports the idea that investor confidence remains intact. According to new insights from CryptoQuant, the STH SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) 30-day moving average—a metric that tracks the average profit or loss realized by short-term holders—has recently hit a local high. This signals a noticeable increase in realized profits among recent buyers, typically a sign of strength in an uptrend. Crucially, this level of realized profit hasn’t yet reached the euphoric extremes seen during major market tops. That suggests the current profit-taking is healthy and not yet disruptive to the broader bullish structure . With momentum building, Bitcoin could be gearing up for its next big move. Bitcoin Flirts With Breakout As Global Market Dynamics Shift Bitcoin is once again testing critical resistance just below the $110,000 mark, hovering in a tight consolidation range as it flirts with the possibility of an impulsive breakout. Price structure remains bullish across multiple timeframes, but all eyes are on whether BTC can generate enough momentum to break through and reclaim price discovery. Meanwhile, global tensions are escalating, adding new variables to an already volatile macro landscape. A recent Federal court decision to strike down US President Trump’s tariffs on multiple countries has shaken market expectations, introducing a fresh wave of uncertainty across global trade and equity markets. While traditional assets digest the impact, Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies are quietly holding firm—if not thriving—under these tighter economic conditions. Both BTC and ETH have maintained strong price floors, signaling continued investor interest in digital assets as macro hedges. On-chain data further supports this resilience. According to analyst Axel Adler , the STH SOPR (30DMA)—which tracks the average profit or loss realized by short-term holders—has recently hit a local high. This means short-term investors are locking in noticeable profits. However, the metric has not yet reached the overheated, euphoric levels typically seen near cycle tops. Despite increased realized gains, demand for Bitcoin remains robust, suggesting the bull trend is still intact. This healthy profit-taking behavior, combined with strong holding patterns, paints a picture of a market that is gearing up, not cooling down. If resistance gives way, BTC could see a powerful continuation to the upside, potentially dragging the broader crypto market along with it. BTC Consolidates Below Critical Resistance Bitcoin is currently trading at $108,495 on the 4-hour chart, continuing to consolidate just below the key $109,300 resistance level. This zone has repeatedly rejected price advances over the past several sessions, creating a short-term ceiling that bulls have yet to break. Despite the resistance, BTC remains in a strong uptrend, supported by a series of higher lows and sustained buying pressure at key moving averages. The 34 EMA ($108,513) is now acting as dynamic support, while the 50 and 100 SMAs ($109,024 and $106,516, respectively) have helped contain previous pullbacks. A successful reclaim of the $109,300 resistance would likely trigger an impulsive move toward the previous all-time high near $112K. The volume remains relatively stable, and the price is holding above the broader support band between $ 106,000 and $103,600. This zone has served as a launchpad for recent rallies, and as long as BTC remains above it, the bullish structure remains intact.

2025-05-30T01:00:35.000Z,"Bitcoin Warning: Bull Trap Or $270,000 Rocket? Analyst Exposes What’s Coming","Crypto analyst Dr. Cat (@DoctorCatX) has issued a high-stakes warning about Bitcoin’s trajectory, suggesting the market now stands at a decisive technical crossroads. In a detailed post on X, Dr. Cat challenged the widespread optimism surrounding a casual correction to $90,000, dismissing the idea as “a fairy tale” unsupported by multi-timeframe Ichimoku data. Bitcoin $90,000 Dream Is A “Fairy Tale” “To make it clear,” the analyst wrote, “the idea to casually dip to 90K and resume the daily uptrend sounds like a fairy tale to me.” According to Dr. Cat, such a move would require Bitcoin to breach no fewer than four critical support levels on higher timeframes, which he considers “so unrealistic that… [it] may come only in the dreams of someone sidelined waiting for these prices.” Related Reading: US Set To Reign As ‘Bitcoin Superpower,’ Declares Trump’s Digital Assets Chief Instead, Dr. Cat identifies a narrow window of “imbalances” across the daily, 2-day, and 3-day Ichimoku indicators—most notably between $102,600 and $106,300—that remain untapped. “These are pending a touch,” he noted, pointing to the Kijun Sen and Tenkan Sen levels as crucial balance markers. The weekly Chikou Span (lagging span), a key indicator in Ichimoku theory, currently sits above prior candle closes—a historically bullish condition that suggests Bitcoin is still in a strong uptrend unless it closes below those support levels. Dr. Cat charted these historical supports using the 26-period look-back rule: approximately $103.600 for this week, rising to $108.300 by mid-June before dipping toward $99,000 by late June. “If CS has managed to keep above candles so well until now on the steepest past slope, it’s very unlikely to go below them,” he emphasized. However, the bullish case comes with a short fuse. A pivotal technical event—the bullish TK cross on the weekly chart—is expected on June 9. “But if [it’s] below ATH, it will be fake as Kijun Sen will be flat,” he warned. In plain terms: unless Bitcoin prints a new all-time high shortly after the TK cross, the signal will be invalidated. On the other hand, a new ATH post-cross would confirm what Dr. Cat calls a “super clear and bullish signal: very, very unlikely not to be followed immediately by a strong bullish continuation.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Explode On Bessent’s $250 Billion Deregulation Shock Notably, he flags a divergence between BTCUSD and BTCEUR, the latter of which is already showing the Chikou Span dipping into candle territory, a neutral-to-bearish signal. “BTCEUR… looks significantly worse than BTCUSD,” he observed. “This chart is simply neutral and can go either way: much higher than here, or as low as ~70K EUR.” He attributes some of the current BTCUSD bullishness to USD weakness, adding that mid-June will likely clarify whether this price strength is structurally sound or artificially inflated. Zooming out to the monthly chart, Dr. Cat unveiled his most aggressive forecast yet: $270,000 per BTC, based on Ichimoku Price Theory’s “4E model.” While he acknowledged this as a “wild guess,” he argued that the crypto market tends to defy consensus expectations. “Plenty of people seem to be skeptical of this bull run,” he said. “And even if they expect it to continue, they bet mostly on shy/moderate targets. My bet is on the latter [being surpassed].” The next two to three weeks will be decisive. A failure to break all-time highs in June—combined with Chikou Span weakness or daily trend breakdowns—could signal a prolonged cool-off into Q4. Until then, all eyes are on the weekly TK cross and the market’s reaction. At press time, BTC traded at $108,783.

2025-05-30T00:55:04.000Z,"Asia Morning Briefing: Cooling BTC Pushing Up Altcoin Volumes","Good Morning, Asia. Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Bitcoin (BTC) is trading above $105K as Asia begins its business day, down 1%. In a note, Paris-based digital assets trading firm Flowdesk wrote that the world's largest digital asset was moving into a tactical posture with price consolidation. \""As BTC consolidates near all-time highs, altcoin volumes and liquidity have seen a continued meaningful shift upwards,\"" Flowdesk wrote. Flowdesk notes that Bitcoin's volatility continues to decline despite looming macroeconomic events that typically shake up markets. With BTC consolidating near its all-time high, there's a noticeable rise in call overwriting, Flowdesk observed, as traders seek to monetize potential upside without giving up core bitcoin exposure. \""The altcoin rotation continues, ETF inflows are back, and vol positioning reflects a transition to more tactical, yield-generating strategies,\"" Flowdesk concluded. Meanwhile, CoinDesk's Market Insight bot reported that BTC faces downside risks after hitting strong resistance near $108.8K, but ongoing institutional interest may provide support. Unknown block type \""articleLink\"", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option House Republicans Unveil New Crypto Bill Giving CFTC Key Oversight Role U.S. House Republicans officially introduced the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, CoinDesk reported Thursday U.S. time , their latest push to regulate crypto markets. This 236-page bill, a successor to the earlier FIT21 Act, gives the Commodity Futures Trading Commission primary oversight of digital commodity markets, establishes clear guidelines for crypto exchanges, and exempts certain decentralized finance (DeFi) services from Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) oversight. Flowing parallel to this, the Senate remains focused on separate bipartisan stablecoin legislation, which is further along procedurally but faces ongoing debate. With committee hearings scheduled for next week, lawmakers will publicly discuss the new House bill, setting the stage for negotiations that could shape U.S. crypto regulation this session. 'Crypto Mom' Peirce Says Traders Need to Take Personal Responsibility Hester Peirce, chief of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's crypto task force, urged crypto investors at Bitcoin 2025 to take personal responsibility for their losses rather than seek government bailouts, CoinDesk reported Thursday from BTC Vegas. Peirce emphasized consistency among libertarian-minded crypto traders, arguing that those who demand freedom must also accept accountability for their financial outcomes, particularly when engaging in speculative ventures like memecoins. Peirce highlighted ongoing efforts under Republican leadership to clarify the SEC's jurisdiction, stating that most crypto tokens aren't securities and thus don't require SEC registration unless they are explicitly involved with securities. She remained neutral on companies holding digital assets on their balance sheets, provided proper disclosure. Despite the current strides in policymaking at the SEC, Peirce noted that establishing a federal crypto regulator for retail trading would necessitate clear legislative action from Congress. Blockchain Founders Fund Surpasses 200 Investments Blockchain Founders Fund (BFF), a Singapore-based venture capital firm focused on early-stage Web3 and blockchain startups, is set to announce Friday at Web Summit in Vancouver that it has surpassed 200 investments across more than 160 companies. Founded in 2018, the firm is known for supporting projects such as Shardeum, an Ethereum-compatible blockchain platform utilizing dynamic state sharding, and Validation Cloud, an infrastructure company merging traditional enterprises with blockchain and AI technologies. The fund announced in October that it had hit the 150 mark for investments. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin is trading at $105,713 as Asia begins its business day, having fluctuated between $105,682 and $108,927 over the last 24 hours, encountering resistance near the upper range and signaling potential bearish momentum.

2025-05-30T00:50:03.000Z,"Twenty One Secures $100M Boost, Advances Toward Pivotal SPAC Merger","BitcoinWorld Twenty One Secures $100M Boost, Advances Toward Pivotal SPAC Merger The world of digital assets is constantly evolving, marked by significant moves from institutional players. A recent development that has captured attention is the latest funding round for Twenty One , a prominent Bitcoin treasury firm. The company has successfully raised an additional $100 million, pushing its total capital raised to an impressive $685 million. This news comes as the firm makes significant strides towards a major SPAC merger , signaling growing confidence in the institutional adoption of digital assets and highlighting the potential for substantial Cryptocurrency Investment in structured financial products. Twenty One’s Funding Milestone: Reaching $685 Million The additional $100 million was secured through convertible senior secured notes. This type of financing allows investors to potentially convert their debt into equity at a later date, often under specific conditions. According to CoinDesk, this recent infusion of capital stems from existing investors and sponsors exercising options that were part of an earlier fundraising round in April. Key details of the financing include: Amount Raised: An additional $100 million. Financing Instrument: Convertible senior secured notes. Total Capital: Brings Twenty One’s total capital raised to $685 million. Source: Existing investors and sponsors exercising April options. Note Terms: 1% coupon rate, due in 2030. This substantial fundraising underscores strong investor belief in Twenty One’s strategy and future prospects, particularly as a leading Digital Asset Firm focused on treasury management involving Bitcoin . Navigating the Path to Public Markets: The SPAC Merger with CEP Beyond the funding news, Twenty One is actively progressing towards a merger with Nasdaq-listed Cantor Equity Partners (CEP). The chosen route for this significant corporate event is a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) merger structure. What is a SPAC merger? A SPAC, often called a “blank check company,” is a firm with no commercial operations that is formed solely to raise capital through an initial public offering (IPO) for the purpose of acquiring or merging with an existing company. For a private company like Twenty One, merging with a listed SPAC offers an alternative path to becoming a publicly traded entity compared to a traditional IPO. The strategic rationale behind this SPAC merger with a reputable financial institution like CEP is clear. It provides Twenty One with: Public Listing: Access to public capital markets. Enhanced Credibility: Association with a long-standing financial player like Cantor Equity Partners. Increased Visibility: Greater exposure to institutional and retail investors. This move is a significant step for a Digital Asset Firm seeking mainstream financial integration. Twenty One’s Strategy: A Focus on Bitcoin and Treasury Management Twenty One positions itself as a Bitcoin treasury firm. This implies a focus on holding and managing significant amounts of Bitcoin as part of its corporate treasury strategy, potentially similar to other public companies that have adopted Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Led by Brandon Lutnick, the firm’s actions suggest a strong conviction in Bitcoin as a long-term store of value and a strategic asset. This is further evidenced by their disclosed $458 million Bitcoin acquisition earlier this month. Such substantial acquisitions by institutional players are closely watched indicators of increasing institutional confidence and can influence overall sentiment around Cryptocurrency Investment . What Does This Mean for Cryptocurrency Investment and the Market? The developments surrounding Twenty One , its significant fundraising, and its impending SPAC merger with Cantor Equity Partners carry broader implications for the digital asset landscape and Cryptocurrency Investment : Institutional Validation: Large fundraising rounds and mergers involving established financial names signal growing institutional acceptance and integration of digital assets. M&A Trend: This highlights a potential trend of mergers and acquisitions as digital asset firms seek scale, regulatory clarity, and access to traditional financial markets. Maturation of the Space: The use of sophisticated financial instruments like convertible notes and structures like SPACs indicates the increasing maturity of the digital asset industry. Focus on Bitcoin: Twenty One’s clear focus on Bitcoin treasury management reinforces the narrative of Bitcoin as a potential corporate reserve asset. For investors interested in the institutional side of crypto, Twenty One’s journey provides a compelling case study of how a Digital Asset Firm is navigating growth and seeking integration with traditional finance. Conclusion Twenty One’s successful raising of an additional $100 million, bringing its total capital to $685 million, is a significant financial milestone. Coupled with the active progress towards a SPAC merger with Nasdaq-listed Cantor Equity Partners, these events underscore the firm’s ambitious growth trajectory and the increasing convergence of traditional finance and the digital asset world. As a dedicated Bitcoin treasury firm, Twenty One’s strategic moves, including its recent substantial Bitcoin acquisition, reflect a strong commitment to digital assets. This progression is a positive indicator for the broader landscape of institutional Cryptocurrency Investment and the continued evolution of the Digital Asset Firm ecosystem.

2025-05-30T00:45:05.000Z,"SHOCK: Hyperliquid Whale Faces Potential $5.4M Bitcoin Loss","BitcoinWorld SHOCK: Hyperliquid Whale Faces Potential $5.4M Bitcoin Loss The world of cryptocurrency trading is often characterized by high volatility and even higher stakes, especially for those employing significant leverage. Recently, attention has been drawn to a prominent Hyperliquid whale trader, identified as James Wynn, who is reportedly facing a substantial unrealized loss on a large Bitcoin position. What Happened to the Hyperliquid Whale’s Bitcoin Long? According to data shared by HypurrScan and cited by JinSe Finance, James Wynn, known for his significant trading activity on the Hyperliquid platform, holds a substantial Bitcoin long position. This position, however, is currently underwater, facing an unrealized loss estimated at a staggering $5.4 million. The details surrounding this specific trade highlight the inherent risks associated with high leverage: Trader: James Wynn (a known Hyperliquid whale) Platform: Hyperliquid Asset: Bitcoin (BTC) Position Type: Long (betting on price increase) Leverage: 40x Current Situation: Facing an unrealized loss of approximately $5.4 million An ‘unrealized loss’ means the position is currently losing money based on the market price, but the loss isn’t locked in unless the position is closed or, critically, liquidated. Understanding Leveraged Trading and Liquidation Price This situation brings the concepts of leveraged trading and the liquidation price into sharp focus. Leveraged trading allows traders to control a large position with a relatively small amount of capital. In this case, 40x leverage means James Wynn is trading a Bitcoin position 40 times larger than the initial margin (collateral) he put down. While leverage can significantly amplify profits if the market moves favorably, it equally magnifies losses when the market moves against the position. The higher the leverage, the smaller the price movement required to wipe out the initial margin. This is where the liquidation price becomes critical. The liquidation price is the specific market price at which a leveraged position is automatically closed by the exchange to prevent the trader’s losses from exceeding their margin. For James Wynn’s 40x Bitcoin long, the reported liquidation price is set at $106,340. This means if the price of Bitcoin were to drop to this level, Hyperliquid would automatically close his position, realizing the full loss and potentially more, depending on market conditions during liquidation. For a 40x long position, a relatively small percentage drop in the price of Bitcoin can lead to liquidation. Conversely, a 40x short position would face liquidation if the price rose significantly. Why Do Traders Use Such High Leverage? Given the immense risk, one might wonder why traders, especially large ones like a Hyperliquid whale , would use such high leverage like 40x. The primary reason is the potential for outsized returns. Consider this: Without leverage, a 1% increase in Bitcoin price yields a 1% profit on the invested capital. With 40x leverage, a mere 0.25% increase in Bitcoin price could theoretically yield a 10% profit on the initial margin (0.25% * 40 = 10%). This potential to generate significant profits from small price movements attracts aggressive traders. However, the flip side is equally true: a small adverse price movement can lead to rapid and substantial losses, including the loss of the entire initial margin upon reaching the liquidation price . The Implications of a Large Crypto Loss A potential crypto loss of $5.4 million is significant, even for a whale trader. While whales often have deep pockets and can withstand large losses, an event like this highlights the extreme volatility and risk present in the crypto markets, particularly on perpetual futures platforms like Hyperliquid. For the individual trader, reaching the liquidation price means their entire margin for that position is gone. For the platform and other traders, a large liquidation can sometimes add selling pressure to the market, although sophisticated platforms like Hyperliquid have mechanisms designed to minimize market impact. This situation serves as a stark reminder: High leverage is a double-edged sword. Market conditions can change rapidly, turning profitable positions into losing ones quickly. Liquidation is a real and present danger in leveraged trading. Lessons for Traders from This Hyperliquid Whale Situation While the scale of a Hyperliquid whale ‘s position is far beyond that of most retail traders, the principles and risks remain the same. This event offers valuable lessons: Understand Leverage: Never use leverage you don’t fully comprehend. Know the exact price point where your position will be liquidated. Risk Management is Key: Always trade with a stop-loss order to limit potential losses before the liquidation price is reached. Only risk a small percentage of your total trading capital on any single trade. Start Small: If you’re new to leveraged trading, begin with very low leverage (e.g., 2x-5x) to understand the dynamics before considering higher amounts. Volatility Matters: Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are highly volatile assets. High leverage combined with high volatility dramatically increases the risk of rapid liquidation. Don’t Blindly Follow Whales: While tracking large traders can offer insights, their risk tolerance and capital reserves are vastly different from yours. A loss they can absorb could be catastrophic for a smaller trader. The potential crypto loss faced by James Wynn underscores that even experienced, large-scale traders are not immune to the inherent risks of the market and the amplified dangers of high leverage. Conclusion: A Cautionary Tale of High Stakes Bitcoin Longs The situation involving the Hyperliquid whale James Wynn and his substantial unrealized loss on a 40x Bitcoin long serves as a powerful cautionary tale. It vividly illustrates the immense potential rewards and, more importantly, the catastrophic risks associated with high-stakes leveraged trading in the volatile cryptocurrency market. With a reported liquidation price of $106,340 looming, the outcome of this specific position remains uncertain. However, the event itself provides a crucial reminder for all traders: understand your tools, manage your risk diligently, and be acutely aware of the price points that could lead to a significant crypto loss .

2025-05-30T00:33:00.000Z,"圖表解讀系列：RSI：判斷市場是否超買或超賣最簡單的方法","歡迎回到「圖表解讀系列」，讓我們持續簡化技術分析，提煉出你真正需要的實用工具。 我們在前幾篇文章中介紹了 移動平均線 與 MACD 以協助你判斷趨勢與動量。接下來，我們將介紹幫助許多交易者更有信心地掌握交易時機的工具—— RSI 。 什麼是 RSI？ RSI 全名為「相對強弱指數」（Relative Strength Index）。它能幫助你判斷某種幣別近期是否被過度買入或拋售，以及是否可能出現逆轉。 它是一個在 0 到 100 之間波動的折線圖。根據圖表週期，大多數交易者會將 RSI 設定為 14 天、14 小時、甚至 14 分鐘。 與僅追蹤價格的指標不同，RSI 告訴你 最近買賣壓力的極端程度 ，讓你在市場發生逆轉前，提前察覺可能的變化。 如何解讀： RSI 高於 70 = 超買 → 市場可能即將修正 RSI 低於 30 = 超賣 → 市場可能即將反彈 RSI 介於 40至60 = 中性 → 無明確訊號 舉例說明： RSI（紫色區塊）：超買警示 RSI 位於 70 以上，顯示典型的 超買狀態 。 這可能代表BTC近期的多頭趨勢 正在放緩 ，或市場可能面臨回調。 交易者關注的重點： 若 RSI 回落至 70以下 ，可能代表回調已開始。 如果 BTC 保持強勢，RSI 可能會持續處於超買區。這在強勁多頭行情中很常見，但對於進場較晚的買家而言，風險也相對較高。 若 RSI 回落至70以下，可能代表回調已開始。 如果 BTC 保持強勢，RSI 可能會持續處於超買區。這在強勁多頭行情中很常見，但對於進場較晚的買家而言，風險也相對較高。 MACD : 多頭訊號，但動量放緩？ MACD 線（藍色）：4,142 訊號線（橘色）：3,536 柱狀圖 ：正值，但開始趨於平坦，暗示 動量可能正在減弱 。 MACD 持續呈現多頭格局，藍線位於橘線之上，顯示趨勢依然強勁。但需要特別注意柱狀圖的變化。若柱狀圖開始縮減，通常是多頭動能正在轉弱的第一個訊號。 移動平均線 ：BTC 是否過度延伸？ 50日 EMA（黃線）：92,570 200日 SMA（藍線）：91,673 現在的 BTC 價格遠高於這兩條關鍵的移動平均線，確認了當前上升趨勢的強度。 然而，也因此出現另一個提醒： 市場是否過度延伸？ 當價格與均線距離拉得過遠時，通常會出現 健康的回調 ，把價格帶回靠近 50日 EMA 。許多交易者視此位置為牛市中的動態支撐區。 最終重點：現在該出手還是觀望？ 目前趨勢： 整體多頭強勁，但可能已有過度延伸跡象。 RSI： 處於超買區，需保持謹慎。 MACD： 仍屬多頭訊號，但已有初步動量放緩的跡象。 策略： 若已有獲利，現在是考慮獲利了結或調整止損點的好時機。 若正在等待進場，建議觀察是否會 回調至 50日 EMA ，那可能是個更穩健、低風險的進場點。 RSI 實戰高手秘訣 RSI 雖然簡單易懂，但如何運用才是真正的關鍵。以下是專業交易者使用 RSI 的實戰技巧： 理解市場背景 RSI 在 盤整或區間震盪的市場 中能有效發揮功能，因為價格會在支撐與壓力之間反覆波動。但在強勁趨勢（例如牛市）中，RSI 可能會持續數週維持超買或超賣狀態。因此，切勿僅因 RSI 突破 70 就急於賣出，應先觀察整體市場走勢與大局。 搭配其他技術指標使用 RSI 單獨使用雖然有效，但搭配其他指標效果更佳。可以試著搭配以下工具： MACD ：檢查動量變化是否與 RSI 給出的訊號一致。 移動平均線（例如 50日 EMA） ：觀察價格是否偏離關鍵支撐位。 留意背離現象 當價格創下 新高 ，但 RSI 卻沒有同步跟上，反而走低？此謂「 頂背離 」，代表動量可能正在減弱。 當價格創下 新低 ，但 RSI 卻沒有同步跟上，反而上升？此謂「底背離」，市場可能即將反彈。 背離不一定會立刻發生作用，但它是專業交易者絕對不會忽略的重要訊號之一。 RSI 是提前預警工具，而非立即行動的指令 RSI 顯示超買或超賣訊號，並不代表你需要立即採取行動。它應被視為一種提前預警的工具，而不是恐慌性買入或賣出的依據。 善用不同的時間週期，優化您的交易策略 RSI的數據會根據你觀察的時間週期而有所不同 如果 日線 RSI 顯示超買 ，但 1 小時 RSI 開始回落 ，這通常代表市場正處於長期多頭趨勢中的短期回調階段。 聰明的交易者會利用此優勢，等短期 RSI 回落後再切入主趨勢。 這種做法有助於避免追高，並找到更好、更低風險的進場時機。 觀看 RSI 實際操作 下一篇圖表解讀系列文章： 布林通道 – 如何像專業交易者一樣操作波動性交易，敬請期待！ Bitfinex。歷史悠久的比特幣交易所。 The post 圖表解讀系列：RSI：判斷市場是否超買或超賣最簡單的方法 appeared first on Bitfinex blog .",bitfinexblog,https://blog.bitfinex.com/education/%e5%9c%96%e8%a1%a8%e8%a7%a3%e8%ae%80%e7%b3%bb%e5%88%97%ef%bc%9arsi%ef%bc%9a%e5%88%a4%e6%96%b7%e5%b8%82%e5%a0%b4%e6%98%af%e5%90%a6%e8%b6%85%e8%b2%b7%e6%88%96%e8%b6%85%e8%b3%a3%e6%9c%80%e7%b0%a1/,"BTC|EXCHANGE","Education",cryptocompare

2025-05-30T00:12:14.000Z,"House Republicans introduce digital asset market clarity act","House Republicans, led by Financial Services Committee Chairman French Hill (R-AR), have introduced the bipartisan Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act. Co-sponsored by eight other members of Congress—five Republicans and three Democrats—the legislation aims to establish a clear regulatory framework for digital assets in the United States. The CLARITY Act establishes how the United States should treat cryptocurrencies and digital assets. For years, the crypto industry has thrived in a legal gray zone. The absence of clear rules has confused and stifled innovation . This bill is meant to change that. It is a follow-up to last year’s Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), but it further lays out oversight duties. Representative Dusty Johnson said that America was poised to lead the world in the digital assets market but emphasized that this could not happen without a clear regulatory framework. The bill is long and is expected to be the focus of extensive negotiations among the two parties and chambers. In the meantime, it is a strong step forward for crypto legislation in Congress. Key provisions target market oversight The Clarity Act assigns most of the responsibility for supervising crypto trading markets to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The bill confers “exclusive regulatory jurisdiction” on the CFTC for digital commodity spot markets — the areas where commonly used assets such as Bitcoin trade. Meanwhile, the SEC will continue to oversee digital assets classified as securities —those you invest in with the expectation of profiting from the efforts of others. According to this structure, crypto firms would be free to register with the CFTC or the SEC, depending on the digital assets they work with. The bill tenures provisional registration for crypto firms to begin operating while agencies work out the regulations. It also requires platforms to follow anti-money laundering rules outlined in the Bank Secrecy Act. For example, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and wallet providers will be excluded from SEC oversight in some cases. The Clarity Act, if implemented, would allow regulators only 12 months to promulgate rules. That timeline is relatively short in the arcane realm of financial rule-making, which can frequently drag on for years. Congress sparks debate with Clarity Act introduction The Clarity Act comes at a moment of increasing political fascination with crypto and pressure to regulate. Whereas the stablecoin bill is considered further along the track, this latest attempt targets larger market structure issues. The measure is backed heavily by House Republicans, particularly those on the Financial Services and Agriculture Committees. But its future is uncertain. Democrats are divided. Some worry the bill is overly friendly to the crypto industry. Others worry about links between crypto firms and Donald Trump, who has recently re-emerged in the political world. Still, a handful of Democrats have backed clear crypto standards — particularly if they safeguard consumers. The crypto industry, beyond Congress, is paying close attention. The bill has won praise from the crypto advocacy group Stand with Crypto. They describe it as a “big step forward” when providing companies and developers the legal certainty they need to do business in the U.S. Some experts suspect the bill and stablecoin legislation could eventually be bundled into a single package. That would produce an even broader crypto law — possibly the first in the United States. President Trump has urged Congress to pass both bills by August, before the congressional recess. But inside sources say that’s a highly ambitious goal. There will be hearings on the new bill next week. Members of Congress will also have an opportunity to publicly debate what’s in it, amendments, and the way forward.

2025-05-30T00:10:59.000Z,"Jack Mallers aims for Saylor’s crown with billion-dollar Bitcoin bet","At the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Strike’s CEO, Jack Mallers, unveiled an ambitious strategy to rival Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin dominance. As the chief executive officer of one of the most talked-about ventures in digital assets — Twenty-One Capital Inc., Mallers aims to reshape corporate Bitcoin holdings and challenge Saylor’s firm, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), which currently holds over 580,000 BTC, valued at approximately $64 billion. Jack Mallers aims for Saylor’s crown with billion-dollar Bitcoin bet Twenty-One is supported by the investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald LP, stablecoin powerhouse Tether Holdings SA, and the Japanese investment firm SoftBank Group. The company is not simply following the ever-expanding list of businesses chasing after the opportunity to imitate Strategy , Michael Saylor’s software firm that has been transformed into a leveraged proxy for Bitcoin — it is trying to beat it. Twenty-One Capital, backed by notable entities including Tether and Cantor Fitzgerald, recently disclosed a $458 million Bitcoin acquisition. The firm plans to publish its Bitcoin addresses to verify its reserves, emphasizing transparency in its operations. In contrast, Michael Saylor’s Strategy continues its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation, recently purchasing an additional 4,020 BTC, bringing its total holdings to over 580,000 BTC. Mallers envisions Twenty-One Capital acquiring up to 5% of Bitcoin’s total supply, approximately 1 million BTC, signaling a bold ambition to rival Saylor. Many people outside the crypto community have recognized Jack Mallers mostly for being emotional in 2021 when he announced that Bitcoin would become legal tender in El Salvador at the biggest conference in Miami. How Mallers ended up as the leader of Twenty One may be as interesting as Mallers’s story about turning El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele onto Bitcoin. Mallers narrates his journey to explore Bitcoin Mallers explained that his path to Twenty-One went through Tether Holdings SA CEO Paolo Ardoino, who has known Mallers since his early days in Bitcoin. Mallers began revealing his exploration of Bitcoin. He explained that he grew up in and around traditional finance and was first exposed to Bitcoin in 2013 when his father co-founded and sold a discount futures brokerage. Apart from his father, his stepmother is deep in the crypto world, known as BitcoinMom on X. Mallers dropped out of college and founded Zap Solutions Inc., Strike’s parent company, when he was 23. Mallers also revealed that Tether’s sister company, Bitfinex, was the first major exchange to implement the Lightning Network. He continued by saying that he was one of the most vocal early developers of the Lightning Network, referring to the Bitcoin payment protocol. “And so Paolo and I would talk, and that was à la 2017,” the CEO of Strike concluded. In the meantime, Tether was establishing a deeper relationship with Cantor Fitzgerald, the investment bank that US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick led before he was recruited to work as part of President Donald Trump’s executive staff. Cantor helps oversee Tether’s reserves and holds a convertible bond with the largest Stablecoin operator. Lutnick has helped transform Tether, a firm formerly eyed with suspicion by Washington, into an unlikely ally of the president. Due to Cantor’s ties with Trump, Mallers mentioned that Tether is the only link between him and the bank and Lutnick, whose son Brandon currently manages the company. He admitted that he did not know Brandon well, but he was his banker. Crypto investors prefer Mallers to Saylor as a perfect choice for Twenty-One Mallers and Tether crossed each other’s paths over the years, including overlapping in El Salvador, where Strike and Tether now have headquarters. When Mallers launched Strike in El Salvador in 2021, it became the most downloaded app in the country. Strike first relied on Tether’s USDT stablecoin as a substitute for the dollar, but it quickly dumped USDT in favor of partnerships with banks in El Salvador. In 2023, Strike started adding Tether again to its platform. However, it was not until the end of last year when the concept for Twenty- One began to take shape, Mallers said. Mallers remembers meeting Tether and their team in November at a Plan B Forum, a conference co-hosted by the Swiss city of Lugano and Tether. “We had a smart conversation about the direction of the world, their plans, and my plans,” Mallers said. For many people, Mallers is an appealing choice to lead Twenty-One because he is so frank about his defense of Bitcoin. Whereas Saylor frequently appears as a serious businessperson, Mallers comes across with the “crypto bro” appeal that is quite attractive to retail crypto investors. Additionally, Mallers, like many online influencers, is active on his YouTube channel, where he uploads videos and hosts a weekly podcast about Bitcoin and the financial systems called The Jack Mallers Show. Mark Palmer, a senior analyst for fintech and digital assets at Benchmark, also stated that although Michael Saylor’s role as a promoter of Strategy and Bitcoin had been incredibly helpful, Jack Mallers, who is a charming person and famous in the crypto world, is a great choice to promote both Twenty-One Capital and Bitcoin.

According to market data from Coingecko, AVAX, which had a fully diluted valuation of about $10.2 billion and a 24 hour average trading volume of around $610 million, dropped nearly 4 percent in the past 24 hours to trade around $22.44 at the time of this writing. What Happened to Avalanche Fundamentals The Avalanche network has grown to a vibrant web3 ecosystem with more than $1.5 billion in total value locked (TVL) and nearly $2 billion in stablecoins market cap. The mainstream adoption of the Avalanche network by institutional investors has been bolstered by the notable development of its ecosystem’s tokenization technology. As a result, the Avalanche network has achieved more than 46k active daily on-chain users. Meanwhile, several fund managers – led by VamEck, and Grayscale Investments – are seeking to offer spot AVAX ETFs in the United States in the near future. AVAX Price Expectations In the weekly timeframe, AVAX price has been recovering from the 2022 crypto bear market. The utility-focuses altcoin has been forming a macro bullish continuation since March 2024, which is characterized by a falling symmetrical channel in the weekly timeframe. In the four hour timeframe, AVAX price has been forming a symmetric triangular pattern in the past four weeks. AVAX price has respected a rising logarithmic trend established since April 9, thus signaling a bullish continuation pattern. According to on-chain data , AVAX price has established a robust support level above $22.8, especially after 362k wallets accumulated more than 21.65 million AVAX coins. Consequently, a consistent close beyond the liquidity level above $25 will trigger a fresh rejuvenated rally toward the target range between $35 and $55.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/avalanche-avax-price-analysis-and-short-term-forecast/,"ALTCOIN|AVAX|BTC|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis|Altcoins",cryptocompare
2025-05-30T00:05:44.000Z,"Bitcoin: Explosive Upside Ahead? 5 Key Signals Pointing Higher","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin: Explosive Upside Ahead? 5 Key Signals Pointing Higher Is the stage set for the next big move in the Bitcoin price ? Recent analysis suggests several powerful forces are aligning, potentially driving the premier cryptocurrency to new heights. If you’re watching the crypto market , understanding these underlying dynamics is crucial. A deep dive into on-chain and technical data reveals five compelling signals that point towards continued upside potential for Bitcoin . These factors aren’t just isolated events; they represent shifts in market structure and investor behavior that have historically preceded significant price appreciation. Let’s break down what these signals are and why they matter for the future trajectory of Bitcoin . Signal 1: Sustained Whale Accumulation One of the most telling signs of smart money confidence is the behavior of large holders, often referred to as ‘whales’. These entities control vast amounts of Bitcoin and their movements can significantly influence market dynamics. Recent data indicates a sustained pattern of accumulation by these large wallets. What does this mean? Reduced Supply on Exchanges: When whales move Bitcoin off exchanges into cold storage, it signals an intent to hold for the long term, reducing the readily available supply for selling. Confidence in Future Price: Accumulation suggests these large players believe the current price is attractive and expect it to rise considerably in the future. They aren’t selling into strength; they’re buying dips or accumulating steadily. Market Strength: Sustained buying pressure from large players provides a strong foundation for price support. This consistent absorption of supply by whales is a fundamental bullish signal, suggesting strong hands are positioning for significant gains. Signal 2: Strong Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETF products, particularly in the United States, has been a game-changer for the crypto market . These vehicles provide traditional investors with an accessible and regulated way to gain exposure to Bitcoin . The inflows into these ETFs have been substantial and consistent. Here’s why this is bullish: New Capital Injection: ETFs bring significant new capital into the market that might otherwise not have directly invested in Bitcoin . This includes institutional funds, wealth managers, and retail investors using traditional brokerage accounts. Demand Exceeding Supply: The rate at which these ETFs are buying Bitcoin to back their shares often exceeds the rate at which new Bitcoin is mined daily. This creates a supply shock dynamic. Validation and Legitimacy: The success and adoption of Bitcoin ETF s lend further legitimacy to Bitcoin as an asset class, potentially attracting even more conservative investors over time. The sustained demand from the ETF sector is a powerful engine driving the Bitcoin price higher by absorbing available supply. Signal 3: Elevated Investor Sentiment Market psychology plays a significant role in price movements. While not a fundamental driver, elevated investor sentiment can fuel momentum and extend rallies. Various metrics, from social media trends to survey data and funding rates in derivatives markets, suggest sentiment remains broadly positive towards Bitcoin . Why is positive sentiment important? Increased Participation: Positive sentiment encourages more people to buy, from retail investors entering the market to existing holders increasing their positions. Reduced Selling Pressure: When sentiment is high, holders are less likely to sell on minor price dips, leading to more resilient price action. Self-Fulfilling Prophecy: In the short to medium term, widespread belief in a rising market can contribute to that rise as buying activity increases. While sentiment can be fickle, its current elevated state indicates a general bullish outlook across the crypto market , supporting the potential for continued price increases. Signal 4: Rising Open Interest Despite All-Time Highs Open interest refers to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts (like futures or options) that have not been settled. Typically, when an asset reaches new all-time highs, open interest might decline as traders take profits or close positions. However, in the current cycle, open interest in Bitcoin derivatives has remained elevated or continued to climb even as the price reaches record levels. What does this signal? New Money Entering: High open interest at highs suggests new positions are being opened, not just old ones being rolled over or closed. This indicates fresh capital and new market participants are entering the derivatives space, often with bullish bets. Confidence in Continuation: Traders are willing to take on leveraged positions even at high prices, implying confidence that the rally is not over. Potential for Volatility: While bullish, high open interest also increases the potential for large price swings due to liquidations if the market moves sharply in one direction. This metric, analyzed alongside funding rates, provides insight into the leverage and conviction within the market, and current readings suggest a strong belief in further upside. Signal 5: Potential Short Liquidations Above $111,000 The derivatives market isn’t just about bullish bets. Many traders take short positions, betting on the price to fall. Data on liquidation levels shows where these short positions would be forced to close if the price rises, potentially triggering a cascade of buying. Analysis points to significant clusters of short positions that could face liquidation if Bitcoin surpasses levels between $111,000 and $115,000. Why is this a bullish signal? Liquidation Cascades: When the price hits these levels, automated systems force short sellers to buy Bitcoin to cover their positions. This sudden buying pressure can rapidly accelerate the price increase. Fuel for the Rally: These forced buys act as fuel, pushing the price higher and potentially triggering further liquidations at even higher levels. Weakening Opposition: Liquidating short positions removes market participants betting against the price rise, reducing selling pressure. The presence of these potential liquidation zones above current price levels creates a technical setup where a move higher could gain rapid momentum, helping propel the Bitcoin price towards and potentially beyond these targets. Putting It All Together: A Broader Bull Cycle Individually, each of these five signals provides a piece of the puzzle. Taken together, as highlighted by the Cointelegraph analysis of on-chain data and technical indicators, they paint a compelling picture of a market structure geared for further appreciation. Sustained whale accumulation reduces supply, robust Bitcoin ETF inflows create consistent demand, elevated sentiment encourages participation, high open interest shows conviction, and potential short liquidations offer technical upside fuel. The report suggests this isn’t just a temporary bounce, but rather that Bitcoin is firmly entrenched in a broader bull cycle. This cycle is characterized by fundamental shifts in adoption, market infrastructure (like ETFs), and increasing confidence from both retail and institutional players. Price Targets: $120,000+ and Beyond? Based on these bullish signals and the broader market context, the analysis indicates a strong likelihood of Bitcoin surpassing the $120,000 mark in the first half of 2025. Furthermore, the potential exists for the price to reach as high as $200,000 by the end of 2025. It’s important to remember that price targets are projections based on current data and market conditions. The path to these levels is unlikely to be a straight line, and volatility is inherent in the crypto market . However, the confluence of these five bullish factors provides a data-driven basis for these optimistic forecasts. What Does This Mean for Investors? For those participating in or watching the crypto market , these signals offer valuable insights: Actionable Insights: Monitor On-Chain Data: Keep an eye on metrics like exchange reserves, whale wallet movements, and long-term holder behavior. Track ETF Flows: Watch weekly or monthly reports on Bitcoin ETF inflows to gauge institutional and traditional investor demand. Understand Sentiment: While not a primary driver, sentiment indicators can help understand market psychology and potential short-term swings. Be Aware of Liquidation Levels: Understanding where significant liquidation clusters lie can help anticipate potential areas of accelerated price movement. Consider Long-Term Perspective: The analysis points to a broader bull cycle, suggesting that focusing on the long-term trend rather than short-term volatility may be beneficial. Potential Benefits: Significant price appreciation for existing holders. Opportunities for new investors to participate in a potentially growing market. Further maturation and mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin as an asset class. Potential Challenges: Market volatility means significant price swings are possible. External factors (regulatory news, macroeconomic shifts) can impact the market. Reaching price targets is not guaranteed and depends on the continued strength of these signals and overall market conditions. Conclusion: A Bullish Outlook Supported by Data The convergence of sustained whale accumulation , strong Bitcoin ETF inflows, positive investor sentiment, rising open interest at highs, and technical liquidation zones above current levels presents a powerful case for continued upside in the Bitcoin price . These signals, derived from detailed on-chain data and technical analysis, suggest the current market environment is robust and poised for further growth. While no market move is guaranteed, the weight of evidence points towards a high probability that Bitcoin is set to climb higher, with targets of $120,000 and potentially $200,000 appearing increasingly plausible within the next year and a half. For anyone interested in the future of finance and digital assets, keeping a close watch on these key indicators is essential.

In January 2024, the crypto OTC infrastructure firm Finery Markets reported that institutional OTC volumes jumped 106% last year.Cointelegraph approached Hidden Road for comment regarding the estimated OTC volumes globally and in the US, but had not received a response by the time of publication.Rising institutional demandIn December 2024, Higgins highlighted a rising demand for institutional balance sheets from large institutions in an interview with Finance Magnates.“Servicing them [institutional investors] across traditional finance and digital asset ecosystems that have already converged presents a really unique opportunity for us in the marketplace.”Hidden Road’s OTC swap launch in the US marks one of the first products launched by the firm since the company entered a definitive agreement to be acquired by Ripple.Related: Taurus, Parfin partnership to provide crypto infrastructure to institutionsSoon after the deal was announced, Hidden Road received a broker-dealer license from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, a private US corporation and self-regulatory organization regulating member brokerage firms and exchange markets.Hidden Road is also known as one of the first companies to receive a Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) license in Europe, immediately after the framework entered into full force on Dec. 30, 2024.

2025-05-29T13:30:00.000Z,"How African innovators are using blockchain to solve real problems","While blockchain headlines in the West often focus on speculation and regulation, in Africa, it’s a different story, one rooted in necessity, innovation and grassroots adoption. The latest episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast explores this ground-up revolution with Kevin Imani, head of StarkWare’s Africa Venture Studio, who shares how communities across the continent are using blockchain to tackle real-world problems in finance, energy and connectivity.A student movement“Young students were using blockchain before it was mainstream,” Imani explained. From Kenya to Nigeria, local needs, not hype, drove early adoption. In many cases, it was students receiving digital currencies from abroad or freelancers getting paid in dollars and struggling to convert funds into local currency. With limited banking infrastructure or trust in government institutions, decentralized alternatives offered a lifeline.Imani highlighted how centralized systems like Kenya’s E-Mpesa changed access to finance, but still fall short for international payments or off-ramping digital assets. Related: Blockchain.com expands in Africa as local crypto rules take shape“You have to start becoming a trader almost,” he said, describing the convoluted process of converting stablecoins or crypto earnings into usable local funds. This trust gap has fueled peer-to-peer crypto usage. “These were kids holding stablecoins not to spend them, but to store value.” Even before regulators or startups built formal infrastructure, communities had already found use cases for blockchain.Blockchain beyond finance Beyond finance, African innovators are tapping blockchain to address energy insecurity. In rural Zambia, excess power from a mini hydro station could go to waste. Instead, residents can now use that surplus to mine Bitcoin, for example, generating revenue and creating a sustainable power loop. “It’s self-sustaining and reduces waste,” Imani said.Connectivity is another frontier. In areas where traditional internet providers fall short, decentralized WiFi hotspot networks are emerging. With blockchain, community members can share bandwidth and be compensated instantly and transparently. “You don’t need a middleman. It’s fair and trackable,” he said.Still, mainstream adoption remains cautious. Governments like those in Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa are in “standby mode,” focused more on consumer protection than full-scale implementation. But Imani remains optimistic: “The need is there. The technology is here. The only question is how we bridge that gap.”To hear the full conversation on The Clear Crypto Podcast, listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

2025-05-29T13:23:06.000Z,"Tim Berners-Lee says internet DNS should have been more decentralized","World Wide Web and hypertext markup language (HTML) inventor Tim Berners-Lee said that if he were building a domain name service (DNS) today, he would make it “more decentralized.”Speaking at ETH Prague on stage alongside Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, Berners-Lee reflected on early internet architecture decisions.“If I could go back […] I would make it more decentralized,“ he said.DNS was invented in 1983 by Paul Mockapetris, replacing the previous hosts.txt file-based system with a scalable, distributed system for naming IP addresses. Still, while Berners-Lee was not personally responsible for DNS development, he could have opted for a URL structure not tied to the DNS we know today, or he could have pushed for a decentralized alternative. Source: Mely.ethRelated: Decentralized naming could bring ‘next billion’ users to BitcoinCentralization of the DNSThe DNS system is highly centralized, particularly at its top levels of hierarchy. The root zone, which governs top-level domains such as .com and .org, is managed by the US-based nonprofit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).Furthermore, the most authoritative servers are operated by a handful of organizations, further centralizing the system. This allows for easy censorship and control by governments that can unilaterally seize or block domain names.This degree of centralization also makes outages due to centralized service disruption more likely. Control over root zones and domain policies is also concentrated in a few regions and among a select group of stakeholders.There are also concerns regarding privacy because centralized DNS queries can be monitored, logged and intercepted by internet service providers and other intermediaries.Related: Community split on ENS petition against Unstoppable Domains patentCrypto’s solution to the problemDecentralized alternatives to the DNS system are being developed. The most well-known is the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), which maps human-readable names to Ethereum addresses, content on the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS), or other data.Another alternative is Unstoppable Domains. Its system mints domains as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Ethereum and Polygon.ENS has seen a fair share of adoption. In late 2024, ENS Labs also partnered with PayPal and Venmo, sparking speculation about how this partnership is likely to boost mainstream adoption.IPFS runs on Ethereum smart contracts and aims to be user-owned and censorship-resistant. Currently, it is primarily used in Web3 applications, wallets and decentralized websites.Another alternative is Handshake (HNS), which aims to be a decentralized and permissionless naming protocol that is compatible with traditional DNS. A project with a similar aim is Namecoin (NMC), an early Bitcoin fork designed specifically to offer .bit domains and store DNS records onchain with censorship resistance.IPFS is also accompanied by its own Inter-Planetary Name System (IPNS), which enables mutable naming for IPFS addresses (hashes). URLs generated this way point to specific content, not servers.A non-crypto alternative to DNS is OpenNIC. This is a user-run project that offers non-ICANN domains, aiming to decentralize control through community governance.Magazine: Move to Portugal to become a crypto digital nomad — Everybody else is",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/tim-berners-lee-says-dns-should-have-been-more-decentralized?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

In a May 29 X post, Aave founder Stani Kulechov said the foundation borrowed $2 million in GHO tokens. “The EF is not only supplying ETH to Aave, but also borrowing from Aave,” Kulechov wrote, describing the development as “the full DeFi circle.”GHO is a decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin native to the Aave Protocol. Unlike centralized stablecoins, GHO is governed by Aave’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which oversees interest rates, collateral requirements and facilitator selection. The move highlights the EF’s growing engagement with the DeFi ecosystem, moving toward more sophisticated treasury strategies. The foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Source: Stani KulechovEthereum Foundation previously deployed $120 million in DeFiThe foundation’s move to borrow GHO follows a previous $120 million deployment into various protocols, signaling a shift in how it manages its crypto holdings. In February, the EF deployed 45,000 Ether (ETH) across different DeFi protocols, including Aave, Spark and Compound. At the time, the Ether was worth $120 million. Kulechov previously described the fund deployment as the foundation’s “biggest allocation in DeFi.” Because of the move, the Aave founder said that DeFi will win, expressing optimism as the EF added liquidity to the protocol.Apart from Kulechov, community members also celebrated the move, supporting the EF’s ETH holdings management shift. A community member said the development was a win, saying the foundation should “keep it up,” while an X user said it would be positive if the EF continued to use their funds this way. Related: Ethereum Foundation unveils security initiative to supplant legacy systemsCriticisms of the foundation selling Ether In January, Ethereum community members called on the foundation to explore alternatives to selling ETH for operational funding. The community suggested DeFi tools like staking and borrowing stablecoins against ETH. Eric Conner, co-author of EIP-1559, criticized the ETH selling, saying that the foundation’s primary use case seemed to be dumping its holdings. He called the practice “insane,” urging the EF to stake or use DeFi instead of selling. Anthony Sassano, host of The Daily Gwei, proposed that the EF stake part of its ETH and sell the staking rewards.

We’re re-architecting everything,” said Donut founder and CEO Chris Zhu. “We’re reconstructing the front end of the internet to be hyper-financialized for AI agents.”  Donut closes $7 million pre-seed round.

Mainstream browsers will also integrate agentic capabilities or build interoperability with purpose-built agentic browsers as AI becomes cheaper, according to Zhu.However, the most significant adoption will come within the next decade when onchain and offchain environments will be completely merged for internet users, Zhu said, adding:“Agentic browsers are poised to become the default entry point — much like smartphones replaced feature phones.”In the long term, Donut aims to support payments, gaming, content creation and social interaction, all within a single crypto-native browser. The company also plans to leverage advancements in decentralized identity and confidential computing to turn the browser into a personal “crypto CFO” for retail users.

SOL/ETH weekly price chart. Source: TradingViewFor SOL/ETH, this projects a downside target for July, near 0.038 ETH, representing a 40% decline from current levels.The 50-week exponential moving average (50-week EMA; the red wave) around 0.0628 ETH is offering interim support. A decisive weekly close below this level would likely confirm the bearish continuation toward the 0.038 ETH target.A bounce, on the other hand, could have SOL reclaim the wedge’s lower trendline as support, which may delay the breakdown scenario. Breaking above the wedge’s upper trendline will likely invalidate the 40% crash setup altogether.Cooling memecoin frenzy hints at SOL/ETH crashThe breakdown in SOL/ETH aligns with a visible decline in memecoin-driven activity on Solana. A key indicator is Pump.fun, the largest memecoin launch platform on the network, which shows a sharp drop in daily fee revenue since early April. Daily fees peaked in Q1 2025 but have since fallen to near-yearly lows, signaling reduced speculative activity on the chain, according to Dune Analytics.Pump.Fun fee and revenue chart.

During this period, total cumulative fees surged past 3 million SOL as retail traders flooded the network to launch and trade meme tokens. These metrics have crashed ever since, weakening one of Solana's primary value drivers.A May 27 report from Standard Chartered further reinforces the downside narrative.

The retail CBDC pilot is being conducted with select customers and merchants through participating banks, while the wholesale pilot is targeting use in the interbank market.Per the report, the retail pilot has reached 600,000 users across 17 banks.

SOC 2 Type 1 is a report assessing a company’s controls related to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality or privacy at a specific point in time. Such an audit verifies that the firm’s controls meet trust service criteria at the time of the check.SOC 1 Type 1 is a similar report focused on internal controls over financial reporting at a specific point in time.

2025-05-29T06:07:12.000Z,"Bitcoin $120K ‘epic mic drop’ rally set after US court blocks Trump tariffs","Bitcoin is poised to rally toward $120,000 after a US federal court blocked the majority of President Donald Trump’s tariffs, a crypto analyst says.“The trade court decision was an epic mic drop, and it’s going to intensify momentum behind Bitcoin,” Swyftx lead analyst Pav Hundal told Cointelegraph. The US Court of International Trade reportedly blocked Trump from imposing his tariffs on May 28, arguing that he overstepped his authority.Court “blows a hole in trade talks”Hundal said the decision would have a domino effect on Bitcoin’s price and believes “new all-time highs are imminent, and the momentum is largely irreversible at this stage.”Bitcoin’s (BTC) current all-time high of $111,970 was reached on May 22, but it has since fallen to trade around $107,750, according to CoinMarketCap data.Bitcoin is down 3.36% over the past seven days. Source: CoinMarketCapThe Trump administration has reportedly filed an appeal to the court’s decision and Hundal said that regardless of whether it presents a new justification for the tariffs, the market sentiment has already changed.“It blows a hole in trade talks either way, and that means we’re likely to witness a significant repositioning in the market.”On April 2, Trump signed an executive order and claimed emergency powers, levying so-called “reciprocal tariffs” on every country starting at 10%.Trump’s initial tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China, introduced in early February, were widely seen as the primary catalyst behind Bitcoin falling below $100,000 and staying under the psychological level until May 8, as broader macroeconomic uncertainty intensified.“The trade war likely delayed a meaningful greed, really — but it didn’t bury it. The trend is higher,” Hundal said. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes said, “Buy everything round dos.”Traders ponder “green candles” tomorrowCrypto analyst Bitcoin Ranchy said, “So Trump tariffs are illegal? Does that mean we get green candles all around tomorrow?”Hundal said “a wall of money” is coming into Bitcoin through corporations, spot Bitcoin ETFs and retail.

However, he added that the time he spent on DOGE wasn’t as significant as many believed, and he blamed media coverage for overrepresenting his involvement.“It’s not like I left the companies. It was just relative time allocation that probably was a little too high on the government side, and I’ve reduced that significantly in recent weeks.”When Musk announced in Tesla’s first quarter report that his time spent on DOGE would drop significantly in May, Tesla (TSLA) shares rose over 5% in after-hours trading, despite the company reporting an 80% drop in net income.As of March 31, Tesla still held 11,509 Bitcoin (BTC), currently valued at about $1.24 billion.Related: Musk confirms X Money beta testing ahead of planned 2025 launchTesla shares are still down 5.9% year to date, in part due to Musk diverting his attention away from the company and Tesla’s sales falling considerably in the first quarter.However, the fall is in line with other Big Tech firms, including Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG), which are also in the red in 2025.Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/elon-musk-leaves-doge-admit-tougher-than-expected?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Initial financing is secured and we are ready to accelerate from here!” he added in another post. The convertible loans total 45 million Swedish krona ($4.6 million), are interest-free and mature on June 30, 2028.

However, the altcoin has maintained a positive signal by closing above the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA) for three consecutive weeks. This critical level has historically acted as a catalyst for significant price rallies.Solana 1-week chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewIn late 2023, SOL broke through the 50-week and 100-week EMAs, solidifying its position above these levels before surging 515% by March 2024. The relative strength index or RSI on the weekly chart is currently at 52.60, indicating growing buying pressure. This setup mirrors past patterns where SOL broke above the 50-week EMA and rallied significantly. With current technicals aligning, SOL appears poised to retest the $300 level by late 2025, a key psychological and historical resistance.Using trend-based Fibonacci (FIB) extensions, SOL’s potential upside could be more compelling. The FIB extension, taken to the January highs of $295 from the recent swing lows near $95, outlines an immediate target of around $300, or a 70% increase.Solana Fibonacci trend extension analysis.

According to CoinGlass, Solana futures open interest (OI) stands at $7.5 billion — just $1 billion short of its Jan. 19, 2025, peak of $8.5 billion. Elevated OI levels typically signal heightened speculative interest and suggest that traders are positioning for significant price volatility.Solana futures open interest. Source: CoinGlassFunding rates across exchanges have also turned negative, indicating a tilt toward short positions as SOL struggles to reclaim the key $180 resistance. While this often reflects bearish sentiment, it also opens the door for a potential short squeeze. Crypto futures analyst Byzantine General pointed out that current market conditions — characterized by elevated OI, rising aggregated volume, and relatively muted cross-exchange funding — suggest that SOL price may be stabilizing. He noted this setup could catalyze a sharp upside move, with the possibility of a breakout toward the $300 level if momentum builds.Solana price, aggregated open interest, volume, and funding rate.
