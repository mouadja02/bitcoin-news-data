2025-05-30T10:56:06.000Z,"Crypto Could Shatter Public Trust in Banks, Warns European Central Bank Official","The post Crypto Could Shatter Public Trust in Banks, Warns European Central Bank Official appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As traditional banks grow more curious and increasingly involved in crypto, not everyone’s celebrating the shift. On Friday, European Central Bank (ECB) policymaker and Bank of Italy Governor Fabio Panetta raised a red flag. Panetta sees serious risk. His message was clear: banks diving into digital assets could end up paying a price in customer trust. And if that trust cracks, it’s not just crypto that takes the hit – it’s the entire financial system. So, what’s got the ECB sounding the alarm? And why now, when crypto adoption seems more mainstream than ever? Let’s break it down. The Confidence Risk Banks Can’t Ignore At the Bank of Italy’s annual report presentation, Panetta made his concerns public. He warned that as more banks strike deals with crypto firms, they risk confusing customers who might assume these products come with the same safeguards as traditional banking. “Crypto-asset holders might not fully understand their nature and conflate them with traditional banking products, with potentially negative repercussions for confidence in the credit system should losses occur,” Panetta said. To be fair, it’s not just a hypothetical problem. If people lose money thinking their bank-backed crypto is as safe as a savings account, the fallout could do real damage to public confidence. Europe’s Banks Are Already in Deep! Despite the risks, some of Europe’s biggest financial institutions are already in the game. Italy’s Intesa Sanpaolo made a splash earlier this year when it bought one million euros worth of Bitcoin. CEO Carlo Messina called it a “test,” but the move was just one step in a broader crypto strategy. The bank set up its own digital asset trading desk in 2023 and is now handling spot crypto trades. Meanwhile, over in Spain, Santander is reportedly planning a deeper crypto push. According to Bloomberg, the bank is considering launching a stablecoin and offering crypto access to retail users through its digital platform. These developments are exactly the kind Panetta is watching closely. They reflect the increasing integration between traditional banks and the crypto world – a shift that’s happening faster than regulators may be ready for. Something to think about. Stablecoins and Big Tech: A Bigger Threat? Panetta didn’t stop at crypto-assets. He also called out stablecoins, warning that their growth could undercut traditional payment systems especially if big tech firms decide to throw their weight behind them. “In the absence of adequate regulation, their suitability as a means of payment is doubtful, to say the least,” he said. His concern is that massive tech platforms could promote stablecoins on a global scale, sidelining central bank money in the process. Europe’s Strategy: Compete With Crypto, Not Ban It Still, Panetta isn’t calling for a crackdown. Instead, he sees the solution in catching up – not clamping down. That’s where the European Central Bank’s digital euro project comes in. “What is needed is a response that matches the ongoing technological transformation,” he said. “The digital euro project stems precisely from this need.” In short, Panetta’s message is this: crypto’s not going away. But if banks and regulators don’t move carefully and quickly public trust could take a hit.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/crypto-could-shatter-public-trust-in-banks-warns-european-central-bank-official/,"BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING","News",cryptocompare
2025-05-30T10:47:38.000Z,"Why Is Crypto Down Today? – May 30, 2025","The crypto market stays in the red as the market works to consolidate. All top 10 coins per market cap have seen their prices drop over the past 24 hours. At the same time, the cryptocurrency market capitalization has decreased by 4.5%, falling from $3.55 trillion to $3.45 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $130 billion, rising over the past two days. TLDR: Crypto market works to stabilize; BTC decreased to the $105,800 level; Analysts argue the market is likely seeing a correction rather than a bearish reversal; BTC may continue to trade within the current range; US spot BTC ETFs break the inflow streak; Any unexpected strength in inflation could introduce volatility and pressure crypto prices. Crypto Winners & Losers At the time of writing, all the top 10 coins per market capitalization are down. Bitcoin (BTC) has decreased by 2% to the price of $105,816 from yesterday’s price of $107,940. This is also down from the intraday high of $108,847. Ethereum (ETH) fell by 3.8%, now trading at $2,623. This is also a drop from the intraday high of $2,732. The highest drop in this category is Dogecoin (DOGE)’s 8.7%. The coin is currently changing hands at $0.2052. Of the top 100 coins, one is green today. LEO Token (LEO) appreciated 1.1% to the price of $9.14. Optimism (OP) recorded the highest decrease in this category, having dropped 12.7% to $0.6863. According to James Toledano, Chief Operating Officer at Unity Wallet , Bitcoin’s rally has already priced in bullish catalysts like institutional inflows and geopolitical uncertainty. The COO argues that, “With open interest still high and funding rates relatively neutral, this sideways movement suggests a temporary breather rather than a trend reversal.” Now, the liquidity is tightening ahead of key economic data, so “traders are likely adopting a wait-and-see approach,” Toledano says. “I see it as a stabilization and not a stall, reflecting a classic consolidation phase after strong gains earlier in the month.” ‘New Normal Created by Trump Threatens Economic Stability’ In a comment, Toledano opined that price compression at the current level may set the stage for a larger breakout or breakdown. This will depend on macro cues and risk sentiment. Notably, he highlights, “All bets are off as we brace for what might come out of President Trump’s administration next. This new normal potentially threatens any notion of economic stability and consistency.” Moreover, Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at crypto platform YouHodler , says that the recent activity seems to be a correction rather than a bearish reversal. For much of this year, he argues, BTC has traded within the $90,000–$110,000 range. This has become a key consolidation zone. “This area is saturated with market orders, suggesting strong trading interest and potential support. Given these dynamics, it is likely that BTC will continue to trade within this range for some time, potentially building a solid foundation for the next leg higher toward a new all-time high,” Lienkha says. $BTC options open interest recently hit an all-time high of $46.2B – up +$25.8B from the lows. This sharp growth outpaces futures and signals rising demand for more advanced hedging and strategy execution as market participants grow more sophisticated. pic.twitter.com/YXp24CRVfC — glassnode (@glassnode) May 29, 2025 Moreover, comparing BTC and ETH, Lienkha says the former is seen more as a portfolio diversifier, even if allocations remain relatively small. The latter, however, is “still perceived as a more niche or ‘exotic’ alternative, and broad institutional adoption is likely still some way off.” Nonetheless, due to its strong fundamentals, Ethereum is a popular portfolio diversifier among retail investors. Finally, Lienkha expects Bitcoin to maintain a correlation with US tech equity indices over the medium term, as both are sensitive to macroeconomic conditions such as interest rates and liquidity. However, this correlation may gradually weaken over time as Bitcoin matures as an asset class with distinct drivers. Levels & Events to Watch Next BTC is currently trading at $105,816, moving further away from its all-time high of $111,814, which it hit last Thursday. It’s down 5.5% since. It’s still up 1.6% in a week. The coin has largely been trading around the $106,000 level over the last few hours. However, it broke two support levels in two days. The next one is the $105,000 level, which traders will keep an eye on. Betideas.com spokesman Steven McQuillan commented that BTC grew $15,000 in value in May alone. Traders are predicting the trend will continue. “Our experts are saying there’s an 80% chance that we see a new all-time high in 2025,” he says. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: Tradingview Moreover, the Fear and Greed Index continues falling. It has decreased from 65 to 61 in a day. This is also down from 76 seen last Friday. This is still the greed zone, but it’s moving towards neutral. This suggests that fear is moving in and may potentially drive prices down. While this would mean a red market, it would also present buying opportunities. Source: CoinMarketCap Meanwhile, on 29 May, US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw their net inflow streak broken. It recorded $385.65 million in net outflows. BlackRock is the only one with an increase, recording $125.09 million. On the other hand, US ETH spot ETFs saw $91.93 million in net inflows, including BlackRock’s $50.45 million. Moreover, Unity Wallet’s Toledano noted that there could well be heightened volatility as markets digest the latest PCE inflation data, jobless claims, and Nvidia’s record-breaking $26 billion quarter. “The combination of potentially soft inflation, a cooling labor market, and positive tech earnings from a giant like Nvidia could create a supportive environment for Bitcoin [which often tracks tech-driven rallies],” Toledano says. “If the PCE data meets or undershoots expectations, it might reduce concerns about aggressive Federal Reserve policy, further benefiting Bitcoin. However, any unexpected strength in inflation could still introduce volatility and pressure crypto prices, despite Nvidia’s positive influence.” Quick FAQ Why did crypto move against stocks today? While the crypto market recorded a decrease, the stock market saw a slight uptick. The S&P 500 has increased by 0.4%, the Nasdaq-100 is up 0.21%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.28%. The stock market reacted well to Nvidia’s profits, but the gains were limited nonetheless. Investors are on high alert due to many judicial events related to Donald Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs. Is this dip sustainable? Analysts argue that the market is currently seeing a correction, rather than a bearish trend, getting ready for the next leg up. However, it’s still highly sensitive to macroeconomic conditions such as interest rates and liquidity.

2025-05-30T10:45:03.000Z,"AI could surpass Bitcoin mining in power consumption by 2026: Study","A study by PhD candidate Alex de Vries-Gao revealed that AI could soon surpass Bitcoin mining in energy consumption. The new analysis claimed that AI could use nearly half of all the power consumed by data centers globally by the end of 2025. De Vries-Gao’s study concluded that AI could be drawing as much electricity as some mid-sized European nations by the end of this year, and the numbers are only rising. AI already accounts for up to a fifth of the power used by data centers, but it is still tricky to pin down the exact figures without big tech companies sharing data on how much energy their AI models consume. In 2023 and 2024, the adoption of generative AI applications drew media attention to the increasing power demand for these applications. Tech companies faced a “power capacity crisis” in their efforts to expand data center capacity as power demand rose to support these applications. De Vries-Gao makes projections based on the ‘triangulation’ technique AI has a power problem. While tech giants pour billions into development, they're hitting a wall that has nothing to do with chips, algorithms, or talent. The problem is fundamental: the electrical grid can't handle what's coming. The latest Prinsights linked below details why. pic.twitter.com/0L4JXJgebV — Nomi Prins (@nomiprins) May 28, 2025 De Vries-Gao made projections based on the supply chain for specialized computer chips used for AI as he and other researchers tried to understand AI’s energy consumption. The researchers discovered that AI’s energy appetite is growing fast enough to warrant more scrutiny despite efficiency gains. To figure this out, De Vries-Gao used what he called a “triangulation” technique. The researcher turned to publicly available device details, analyst estimates, and companies’ earnings calls to estimate hardware production for AI and how much energy that hardware is likely to use. De Vries-Gao calculated how specialized AI equipment could be produced and compared that to information about how much electricity these devices consumed. He found that last year, they likely burned through as much electricity as his home country of the Netherlands . “That’s how we know that both Google’s and Microsoft’s carbon footprints have grown in recent years as they focus on AI. But companies usually don’t break down the data to show what’s attributable to AI specifically.” – Alex de Vries-Gao , the founder of Digiconomist Last week, a separate report from consulting firm ICF forecasted a 25% rise in energy demand in the U.S. by the end of the decade, largely thanks to AI, traditional data centers, and Bitcoin mining. Another article published in MIT Technology Review last week, with support from the Tarbell Center for AI Journalism, claimed that it is still hard to make blanket predictions about AI’s energy consumption and the resulting environmental impact. Meta plans to power a giant AI data center with gas Meta announced in mid-May that it is building a new AI data center so large in Louisiana that the local utility company planned to set up three new gas-fired power plants to provide it with enough energy. However, advocates and lawmakers pressed Meta for answers about how it would clean up pollution from the data center’s energy consumption. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) wrote a letter to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on May 14 demanding answers about how much energy the data center would use. He also sought answers about the greenhouse gas emissions that would be generated. The letter pointed out that the gas-powered new data center flew in the face of Meta’s climate commitments. Sen. Whitehouse also stated that Meta’s backslide from its own climate pledges in 2020 risks triggering broader economic harm at a time when corporate responsibility is urgently needed. Logan Burke, the Executive Director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, claimed it is hard to figure out whether a facility like Meta’s is good or bad for communities without understanding the possible impact on electrical systems, bills, and water. However, Meta maintained that it will continue matching its electricity use with support for renewable energy, including a commitment to help fund 1,500 megawatts of new solar and battery resources in Louisiana.

2025-05-30T10:42:58.000Z,"Bitcoin (BTC) Benefits from Bullish Bets, Altcoins Punish the Optimists","While the collective crypto market has witnessed significant recovery this month, there is a growing disconnect in risk appetite among market participants. Investors are correctly positioned for Bitcoin’s rally, but similar optimism in the altcoin space has resulted in heavy losses, shows a recent report. Trader Missteps in Altcoins Since the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, there has been a notable divergence has emerged in the liquidation patterns of BTC and altcoins. Data from Binance reveals that the largest cryptocurrency experienced a dominance of short liquidations totaling $190 million. This trend, according to a new analysis by CryptoQuant, suggests that traders betting against BTC during its price appreciation were consistently forced to exit their positions as the market moved higher. On the other hand, the same cannot be said for altcoins. During the same period, long liquidations in altcoins surged to nearly $1 billion, which was indicative of a continued downward pressure across the broader altcoin market and failed bets on a widespread recovery. As such, the report stated this as a clear sign of liquidation asymmetry. While BTC’s rally led to short squeezes and upward momentum, altcoins saw traders punished for attempting to preempt an “Altseason” that never materialized. Since December 2024, this pattern has intensified, with altcoin liquidations consistently outpacing those of BTC. CryptoQuant attributed this to excessive leverage and misaligned market sentiment, as altcoin bulls were increasingly forced to unwind losing positions. Few Altcoin Gems Emerge as Market Lags Despite the broader underperformance in the altcoin market, some assets stand out. According to analyst Rekt Fencer, increased stablecoin liquidity, a dip in Bitcoin dominance, and a recovering ETH/BTC ratio point to rising investor appetite for altcoins. He named five altcoins – GRASS, PENDLE, ONDO, ENA, and SEI – that he predicts could surge 50x-100x if market momentum continues. These tokens represent strong narratives, including decentralized infrastructure, tokenized yields, real-world asset exposure, synthetic dollars, and high-speed DeFi ecosystems. Meanwhile, other altcoins such as Tron (TRX) have shown resilience, and experts expect it to “multiply significantly in value,” potentially even quadrupling, if Bitcoin continues its bull run through the rest of the year. Sui (SUI) is yet another crypto that has witnessed the emergence of a bullish sentiment.

Analysts look at rising open interest as a signal of growing demand. It suggests another leg up is likely. However, with factors such as profit taking and overall market conditions to consider, there’s the possibility that a negative flip could be inbound.

2025-05-30T10:30:47.000Z,"Navigating the Crypto Fear and Greed Index: Market Sentiment Holds Strong in ‘Greed’","BitcoinWorld Navigating the Crypto Fear and Greed Index: Market Sentiment Holds Strong in ‘Greed’ Are you trying to get a pulse on the unpredictable crypto market sentiment ? One of the most popular tools investors and traders use is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index . This index provides a snapshot of the prevailing emotional state in the cryptocurrency space, offering clues as to whether market participants are feeling overly cautious (fear) or excessively confident (greed). Understanding the Crypto Fear and Greed Index The Crypto Fear and Greed Index , developed by Alternative.me, aims to quantify the emotional state of the crypto market . Why is this important? Because extreme fear can signal a potential buying opportunity (when investors are irrationally selling), while extreme greed can indicate the market is due for a correction (when investors might be getting overly enthusiastic). The index operates on a simple scale from 0 to 100: 0-24: Extreme Fear 25-49: Fear 50-74: Greed 75-100: Extreme Greed As of May 30th, the index registered a reading of 60. While this is a notable drop of 14 points from the previous day’s reading, it firmly keeps the index within the ‘Greed’ zone. This suggests that despite a recent pullback in sentiment, the overall feeling among crypto participants remains positive and optimistic. What Factors Influence the Index? The index isn’t based on just one metric. It aggregates data from six key factors, each weighted differently to provide a comprehensive view of crypto market sentiment : Volatility (25%): Measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average corresponding values over the last 30 and 90 days. Higher volatility often indicates fear. Market Momentum / Volume (25%): Compares the current volume and market momentum (specifically for Bitcoin) with average values over the last 30 and 90 days. High buying volume in a positive market pushes the index towards greed. Social Media (15%): Analyzes posts on social media platforms (like Twitter) for specific crypto-related hashtags and assesses the speed and number of interactions. High positive engagement can signal greed. Surveys (15%): (Currently paused by the provider) Historically involved weekly polls to gauge investor sentiment directly. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Measures Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market cap. An increasing Bitcoin dominance can indicate fear (as investors move from altcoins to the perceived safety of BTC), while decreasing dominance can signal greed (as investors rotate into riskier altcoins). Google Trends (10%): Analyzes search query data related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Rising search interest, especially for terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” or “Bitcoin bubble,” can indicate fear. Decoding the Current ‘Greed’ Reading (60) A reading of 60 means that the collective data points from the factors above indicate a generally positive and optimistic outlook in the crypto market . People are more inclined to buy, hold, and perhaps take on more risk than they would during periods of fear. This level of crypto greed suggests confidence is present, but it’s not yet at the extreme levels (75+) that often precede significant pullbacks. The 14-point drop from the previous day is also noteworthy. While still in ‘Greed’, this decline suggests a slight cooling off in sentiment. This could be attributed to various factors like minor price corrections, specific news events, or just natural market fluctuations. It’s a reminder that sentiment is dynamic and can shift quickly. Navigating the ‘Greed’ Zone: Actionable Insights Being in the ‘Greed’ zone doesn’t automatically mean a market crash is imminent, but it does warrant caution. Here’s what investors and traders might consider: Stay Alert: ‘Greed’ markets can be prone to sharper pullbacks. Avoid making impulsive decisions based solely on positive sentiment. Review Positions: If you’ve made significant gains, consider taking some profits or adjusting stop-loss orders to protect your capital. Avoid FOMO: The fear of missing out (FOMO) is strongest during ‘Greed’ phases. Avoid buying assets solely because they are pumping; always do your own research. Combine Indicators: The Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index (which heavily influences the overall index) is just one tool. Use it in conjunction with technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and broader market news. Understand the Nuance: A reading of 60 is different from a reading of 85. While both are ‘Greed’, the latter signifies a much higher level of potential irrational exuberance. Limitations of the Index While valuable, the index is not a crystal ball. It’s a lagging or concurrent indicator of sentiment, not a predictive tool for price movements. It tells you how people are feeling *now*, but not necessarily what will happen next. It also doesn’t explain *why* sentiment is changing, which requires deeper market analysis. Conclusion: Sentiment Holds, But Watchful Eyes Remain The latest reading of the Crypto Fear and Greed Index confirms that overall crypto market sentiment remains positive, sitting comfortably in the ‘Greed’ zone at 60. However, the recent 14-point dip serves as a valuable reminder that market emotions can shift rapidly. While ‘Greed’ can indicate healthy market momentum, it also calls for prudent decision-making and a cautious approach to avoid potential pitfalls associated with excessive optimism. Keep using the index as one piece of your overall market analysis puzzle.

The announcement, made during the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, marks the first time a global sports team has publicly declared a strategic Bitcoin treasury allocation. Bitcoin Magazine @BitcoinMagazine · Follow JUST IN: European soccer giant Paris Saint Germain announces they adopted a #Bitcoin treasury reserve 🇫🇷 Watch on Twitter View replies 12:05 AM · May 30, 2025 7.9K Reply Copy link Read 237 replies PSG, with a fanbase exceeding 550 million, is now part of a growing group of corporations adding cryptocurrency to their financial reserves in response to shifting global trends and digital asset policy developments. Bitcoin allocation began in 2024 as part of treasury diversification According to Pär Helgosson, head of PSG Labs, the French football giant began acquiring Bitcoin last year using part of its fiat reserves. While the exact amount of Bitcoin held by PSG has not been disclosed, the allocation remains on the club’s books heading into the UEFA Champions League final next week in Munich. The move aligns with broader demographic trends, as the club reports that 80% of its fanbase is under the age of 34—a group widely associated with higher rates of crypto adoption. The Bitcoin initiative is also part of PSG’s push to position itself at the forefront of digital innovation. The club’s involvement in NFTs and fan tokens through its partnership with Socios.com had already laid the groundwork for its crypto strategy. The new Bitcoin holding adds a layer of long-term financial diversification as the club seeks new ways to hedge currency risk and tap into digital-native communities. Football leads crypto sponsorships with 64% annual growth PSG’s move comes at a time when football is experiencing a surge in crypto and digital asset partnerships. According to SportQuake’s latest industry data, football accounts for 43% of all crypto sponsorships across sports for the 2024/25 season. This represents a 64% year-on-year rise in total crypto-related sponsorships, driven largely by European leagues. Notably, 44% of all crypto football sponsorship deals are concentrated within Europe’s top five leagues, including Ligue 1, where PSG currently reigns as champions. Brands continue to prioritise global reach and international audiences, with non-US crypto spend playing a major role amid uncertainty around regulatory direction in the US under President Trump’s administration. Matt House, CEO of SportQuake, noted that this international expansion in crypto sponsorships is being fuelled by delays in US crypto clarity, as companies shift their focus to European markets for faster adoption opportunities. This is particularly evident in the concentration of activity across UEFA leagues. Global corporates accelerate Bitcoin adoption amid ETF boom PSG’s strategy is part of a broader corporate trend toward Bitcoin adoption, accelerated by regulatory developments and the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in multiple markets. The shift from viewing Bitcoin as a speculative asset to a corporate treasury strategy is gaining traction, especially after President Trump’s directive encouraging US federal institutions to explore Bitcoin reserves. Dom Harz, co-founder of Build on Bitcoin (BOB), attributes much of the momentum to ETFs and the emerging perception of Bitcoin as a stable digital asset with passive yield potential. He also pointed to the growing appetite among companies to diversify beyond traditional markets, citing digital assets as a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty and inflation risk. In the case of sports franchises like PSG, the visibility of such moves may influence others to follow suit—especially in regions where crypto regulation is clearer and adoption is higher. While American sports leagues have been slower to engage with crypto on a treasury level, European clubs are increasingly leveraging their global branding power to lead on financial innovation.

2025-05-30T10:25:49.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: Strong Technicals and Institutional Confidence Drive Bullish Outlook","The post Bitcoin Price Analysis: Strong Technicals and Institutional Confidence Drive Bullish Outlook appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News On May 22 , Bitcoin reached a new all-time high , closing at $111,390 after briefly touching an intraday peak of $112,000 . Despite this milestone, market behavior suggests this may not be the euphoric top—capital is still flowing in at unprecedented levels. Investor Confidence Remains Unshaken: $1.8B Daily Inflows Match 2021 Peak According to on-chain analyst Axel Adler Jr. , Bitcoin is now averaging around $1.8 billion in daily net inflows , comparable to the peaks last seen in the November 2021 bull market, when BTC hit $64,000. Adler, known for his data-driven insights shared on platforms like X (formerly Twitter), emphasizes that this volume of inflow is a strong indicator of sustained investor confidence , even after setting new all-time highs. Axel Adler Jr. on X “Daily net inflows remain historically high—even surpassing peak 2021 levels at current price points.” Capital Flows Strongest at High Price Points—Not the Dip Notably, Adler’s data reveals that capital surged most aggressively during price spikes—not dips. At $73,000 , Bitcoin saw $3.6 billion in daily inflows, while the figure jumped to $4.5 billion per day when BTC was around $92,000 . This is a significant shift from past market behavior where buying typically intensified during pullbacks. The current cycle shows growing comfort among investors to buy at higher levels, possibly reflecting institutional conviction rather than short-term speculation. Market Structure: A Breakout Followed by Consolidatio At the beginning of May, Bitcoin hovered around $94,181 , trading sideways in a narrow band. A sharp 6.42% surge on May 8 broke that pattern, launching a new phase of bullish momentum. From May 18 to May 22 , Bitcoin spiked over 8.3% , reaching its new high. However, a brief pullback followed: since May 23 , BTC has dropped approximately 5.8% , now trading at $105,171.54 . The retracement suggests a period of healthy consolidation rather than panic selling, especially considering broader macroeconomic stability and continued crypto ETF interest . Technical Indicators Show Ongoing Strength RSI (Relative Strength Index) : Currently at 53.58 , suggesting neutral momentum. It has held between 50 and 70 since late May, indicating consolidation without immediate overbought conditions. Golden Cross : On May 22 , the 50-day MA crossed above the 200-day MA —a bullish signal. The moving averages now stand at $97,776.48 and $94,668.91 respectively, with the gap widening, affirming strong trend momentum. ADX (Average Directional Index) : At 25.88 , it indicates a sustained trend strength. Since late April, the ADX has stayed above 25, further validating the current upward momentum. Looking Ahead: Beyond the ATH While the 5% weekly drop may seem alarming in isolation, zooming out reveals a 30-day gain of 11.1% . The volume of capital inflows, even at elevated price levels, underlines a shift in market psychology. Long-term investors appear increasingly comfortable entering the market at higher valuations, perhaps viewing Bitcoin as a macro-hedge rather than a volatile asset. Final Takeaway The new all-time high for Bitcoin is notable—but what matters more is the context behind it. Historical levels of capital inflow, strong technical signals, and a maturing investor base all point to a market that is evolving , not overheating. In the words of analyst Axel Adler Jr. , this may be the “ most structurally sound bull cycle yet .” .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-30T10:20:29.000Z,"Bitcoin Options Expiry: Gigantic $9.8B Event Looms for Crypto Market","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Options Expiry: Gigantic $9.8B Event Looms for Crypto Market Get ready, crypto traders! A significant event is on the horizon that could potentially inject some volatility into the market. We’re talking about the massive expiry of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) options contracts, set to happen on May 30th. This isn’t just a small blip; we’re looking at billions of dollars worth of contracts reaching their maturity date. Understanding what this means is crucial for anyone navigating the digital asset space right now. What is Happening with the Bitcoin Options Expiry? According to data from leading crypto options exchange Deribit, a staggering $9.8 billion worth of Bitcoin options contracts are scheduled to expire. This event is pegged for May 30th at 08:00 UTC. Options contracts give traders the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a specific price (the strike price) on or before a certain date (the expiry date). When this date arrives, the contracts either expire worthless, are exercised, or are settled based on the price of the underlying asset. The sheer scale of this Bitcoin options expiry is noteworthy. Nearly $10 billion in notional value represents a substantial portion of the open interest in the BTC options market. Large expiries like this are often watched closely by traders and analysts, as they can sometimes coincide with increased market activity or shifts in sentiment. Understanding the Put Call Ratio Crypto A key metric analysts look at ahead of an options expiry is the put/call ratio. This ratio compares the number of outstanding put options (bets on price going down) to the number of outstanding call options (bets on price going up). For the upcoming Bitcoin options expiry, the put/call ratio stands at 0.89. What does this tell us? A ratio below 1 indicates that there are more call options (bullish bets) than put options (bearish bets) outstanding. A ratio above 1 indicates more put options than call options. A ratio close to 1 suggests a relatively balanced market sentiment between bullish and bearish outlooks. The 0.89 ratio for BTC suggests a slight lean towards bullish sentiment among options traders for these specific contracts, though it’s still relatively close to parity, indicating a somewhat balanced positioning overall. Similarly, for the Ethereum options expiring on the same day, the put/call ratio is 0.82. This also indicates a slight preference for call options over put options among ETH options traders ahead of the expiry. Exploring the Max Pain Price Crypto Another fascinating concept tied to options expiry is the max pain price crypto . This is the strike price at which the largest number of options contracts (both puts and calls) will expire worthless. The theory behind max pain is that market makers and large participants who are on the other side of many of these contracts might have an incentive to manipulate the market price towards the max pain point as the expiry approaches, thereby maximizing their profits or minimizing their losses. For the $9.8 billion Bitcoin options expiry, the max pain price is currently calculated at a striking $100,000 . This is significantly higher than Bitcoin’s current trading price. For the $1.65 billion ETH options expiry, the max pain price is $2,300 , which is considerably lower than Ethereum’s current market value. It’s important to understand that the max pain theory is just one perspective and its influence is debated. The market is influenced by countless factors, and the price doesn’t always gravitate towards max pain. However, it remains a data point that options traders monitor. The ETH Options Expiry: A Concurrent Event While the focus is often on Bitcoin due to its market cap and the sheer volume of the expiry, it’s crucial not to overlook the concurrent Ethereum options expiry. Also happening on May 30th at 08:00 UTC, $1.65 billion worth of ETH options will mature. While smaller than the BTC expiry, this is still a substantial amount and represents significant open interest in Ethereum derivatives. As mentioned, the ETH put/call ratio is 0.82, indicating a slightly more pronounced bullish bias among ETH options holders compared to BTC. The max pain price for ETH is $2,300. This lower max pain price compared to the current market price suggests that, according to the max pain theory, significant value in ETH put options would expire worthless if the price were near $2,300, while many call options would also be out-of-the-money. Potential Impact on the Crypto Options Market and Beyond So, what could these massive expiries mean for the broader crypto options market and the spot prices of BTC and ETH? The impact is often a subject of much debate among analysts. Here are a few potential scenarios or considerations: Volatility Spike: Large expiries can sometimes lead to increased volatility in the hours leading up to and immediately following the event. Traders holding large positions might adjust their spot positions to hedge their options exposure, or market makers might rebalance their books. This activity can amplify price movements. Reduced Open Interest: Post-expiry, the total open interest in Bitcoin and Ethereum options will significantly decrease. This can sometimes lead to a temporary decrease in market depth or liquidity in the options market until new positions are opened. Max Pain Influence (Debated): As discussed, some believe the price might feel pressure towards the max pain point. Given the high max pain for BTC ($100k) and the low max pain for ETH ($2.3k) relative to current prices, this theory would imply different pressures, though the validity of this influence is highly contested, especially when max pain is far from the current price. Sentiment Reset: The expiry clears out existing options positions, allowing traders to open new contracts based on fresh market outlooks. This can sometimes lead to a ‘reset’ in market sentiment as reflected in the open interest and put/call ratios of the newly dominant contracts. Hedging Activities: Large holders of options contracts, particularly institutional players, often hedge their options positions with corresponding spot market trades. As options approach expiry, these hedges may be unwound or adjusted, potentially causing ripples in the spot market. It’s crucial to remember that the crypto market is influenced by a multitude of factors, including macroeconomic news, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and overall market sentiment. While a large options expiry is a notable event, it is just one piece of the complex puzzle. Key Takeaways for Traders and Investors Here’s a quick summary of the key points regarding the May 30th options expiry: Scale: $9.8B in BTC options and $1.65B in ETH options expiring is a significant event. Timing: May 30th at 08:00 UTC is the critical time. Sentiment (P/C Ratio): Slightly more calls than puts for both BTC (0.89) and ETH (0.82), indicating a mild bullish lean among options holders for these contracts. Max Pain: $100,000 for BTC and $2,300 for ETH. This is a theoretical price point and its influence is debated. Potential Impact: Could lead to increased volatility, especially around the expiry time. For those active in the market, staying informed and being prepared for potential price swings is always wise. Don’t rely solely on the max pain price or the expiry date as definitive market predictors. Instead, view this event as one of several factors influencing market dynamics. Conclusion: Watching the Clock on May 30th The upcoming May 30th expiry of nearly $10 billion in Bitcoin options and over $1.6 billion in Ethereum options is undoubtedly a major event on the crypto calendar. While the exact impact on price is always uncertain and subject to broader market conditions, the sheer size of the expiry, coupled with the insights from the put/call ratios and max pain prices, provides valuable data points for market participants. Traders will be watching closely to see how the market reacts as these significant contracts reach their conclusion. As always, exercising caution and managing risk are paramount in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies.

2025-05-30T10:17:09.000Z,"Panama City Proposes Bitcoin Payments for Priority Passage Through Panama Canal","Panama City Mayor Mayer Mizrachi has proposed an idea that could bring Bitcoin into one of the world’s most important trade routes. Speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas on May 29, Mizrachi floated the possibility of allowing cargo ships to pay in Bitcoin for faster passage through the Panama Canal. Panama Canal Could Accept Bitcoin for Priority Passage, Says Mayor Mizrachi spoke about the proposal during a panel discussion alongside El Salvador Bitcoin advisors Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert. AMAZING PANEL WITH MAX, STACY, MIKE, & PANAMA CITY MAYOR MIZRACHI pic.twitter.com/E5sqqHbZkJ — The Bitcoin Conference (@TheBitcoinConf) May 29, 2025 The session was moderated by Mike Peterson, director of Bitcoin Beach in El Salvador. “We have a canal — what if you get a perk for paying in Bitcoin, get your ship to go quicker if you pay in Bitcoin,” The Panama Canal is a critical shipping corridor that connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. It handles around 5% of all global maritime trade and saves ships from weeks of travel around South America. Nearly 10,000 vessels passed through the canal in the last fiscal year, transporting over 423 million tons of goods. The canal generated around $5 billion in revenue for Panama between October 2023 and September 2024, according to the Panama Canal website. The idea of accepting Bitcoin for canal fees comes amid growing political attention on the waterway. In December 2024, U.S. President Donald Trump proposed reclaiming control of the Panama Canal, citing concerns over Chinese influence and alleging unfair treatment of U.S. ships. Mizrachi’s comments reflect his broader push for Bitcoin adoption in public services. He has recently advocated for creating a Bitcoin reserve for Panama City and urged lawmakers to support a more open stance on crypto. Rather than rush into regulation, Mizrachi warned legislators to avoid interfering too soon with the growing crypto sector. “Don’t touch it, don’t get near it, don’t even look at it, let it operate, let it function,” he said. “Then decide what it needs. Do you want to restrict it or do you want to promote it?” The mayor also claimed that Bitcoin use in Panama is more widespread than it appears, estimating over $5 billion in annual transactions. But much of the activity, he said, happens quietly due to fear and lack of public support. Mizrachi’s Bitcoin-for-passage proposal is still conceptual, but it indicates Panama City’s growing interest in blockchain innovation and financial alternatives in global trade. Panama City Eyes Bitcoin Reserve Amid Growing Ties with El Salvador Following Panama City’s move to propose Bitcoin payments for priority canal passage, the city’s pro-Bitcoin stance appears to be deepening. Mayor Mayer Mizrachi has hinted at the possibility of creating a Bitcoin reserve after meeting with Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert, two key figures behind El Salvador’s Bitcoin strategy. Panama City Mayor @Mayer has sparked speculation about creating a Bitcoin reserve after meeting with two of El Salvador’s Bitcoin strategists. #Panama #Bitcoin https://t.co/rNM6EM37pz — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 17, 2025 Shortly after their May 16 meeting, Mizrachi posted “Bitcoin Reserve” on X, fueling speculation. Though no official proposal has been introduced, the timing aligns with his upcoming appearance at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas. Panama City has already made crypto history this year, allowing residents to pay taxes and municipal fees in BTC, ETH, USDT, and USDC since April. The city instantly converts these payments into USD through a local bank. Mizrachi has drawn comparisons to cities like Lugano and states like Colorado, signaling his ambition to align Panama City with other crypto-forward regions. However, any move to establish a formal Bitcoin reserve would require legislative approval from the National Assembly. Keiser noted their discussions touched on mining, financial education, and Panama’s hydroelectric potential. Herbert added that Panama City will integrate El Salvador’s “What is Money?” Bitcoin textbook into its online public library system.

Here's the Amount of XRP They Will Buy!","Despite the bans on Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies in China, interest in BTC and altcoins remains high. At this point, an important move came from a Chinese company. Webus International Limited, a China-based company that provides AI-powered mobility solutions, will raise up to $300 million to create a Ripple (XRP) reserve for global payments. According to the official statement, Webus announced that it plans to raise up to $300 million in non-capital financing to create an XRP reserve. The company also said it has renewed its partnership with Tongcheng Travel Holdings Ltd., one of China's largest online travel platforms. The $300 million funding strategy for the XRP reserve will consist of a mix of existing cash reserves, bank loans, shareholder guarantees, and institutional credit support from traditional banks. However, the company did not specify a timeline for the XRP purchase. Nan Zheng, Chief Executive Officer of Webus, said: “These strategic developments have the potential to create strong synergies between our domestic and international operations, “While our renewed partnership with Tongcheng strengthens our China network infrastructure, an XRP integration has the potential to revolutionize the way we handle cross-border payments for both partners and travelers worldwide.” Webus’ statement comes a day after Nasdaq-listed energy company VivoPower International announced its $121 million strategy to establish its own XRP treasury.

Jamie Raskin Demands Guest List of $TRUMP Coin Dinner appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A heated controversy is brewing in Washington as Rep. Jamie Raskin pushes President Donald Trump to reveal the full list of guests who attended a private dinner after purchasing $TRUMP memecoins. These attendees reportedly spent close to $400 million just to get access. This demand comes during the Bitcoin 2025 Conference in Las Vegas , where major crypto figures like Vice President JD Vance, Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, the Winklevoss twins, and pardoned Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht are promoting the administration’s strong pro-crypto stance. Jamie Raskin Calls for Transparency: Who Bought Their Way In? In a letter sent Thursday, Raskin pressed President Trump to disclose the names of all 220 buyers who used $TRUMP coins to secure a spot at the private dinner. He pointed out that many of these buyers appear to be foreign nationals who only purchased the coins after the event was announced. “These 220 buyers…collectively spent hundreds of millions of dollars — $394 million by one account,” said Raskin, noting that “we deserve to know who is paying for access to our president.” He also expressed serious concerns that the event may break laws regarding foreign government payments, known as emoluments laws. Raskin demanded full disclosure of the sources of funds each attendee used to purchase the coins and set a deadline of June 4, 2025, for this information. The Focus on Justin Sun and Potential Foreign Influence One high-profile figure in the spotlight is Chinese-born crypto investor Justin Sun. He reportedly spent $23 million on $TRUMP coins. Sun has previously faced investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for his connections to a Trump-related crypto firm. Raskin warned that some of the funds may come from illegal sources or foreign governments, raising red flags about possible foreign influence through cryptocurrency. He was clear about what the public should know: beyond “virtually worthless memecoins,” what exactly are these buyers getting in return for their millions? Crypto, Politics, and a Growing Scrutiny This controversy unfolds at a critical moment for cryptocurrency in the U.S. The Trump administration’s aggressive push to embrace crypto, showcased at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference, marks a significant shift in policy.

With Bitcoin recently soaring past $110,000 and hitting a new all-time high, one big question is circling the crypto market: when will altcoins finally catch up? ? Historically, every time Bitcoin leads the charge, it eventually sparks a wave of activity across altcoins — and many believe that moment is approaching fast. However, the mood in the market has shifted over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin and several major altcoins slipped into the red following fresh tariff-related uncertainty in the US.

2025-05-30T09:44:12.000Z,"Panama city eyes Bitcoin fees for canal ships","Panama City Mayor Mayer Mizrachi has proposed granting priority access to ships that pay transit fees using Bitcoin. This initiative aims to integrate cryptocurrency into the canal’s operations, potentially offering a more efficient payment method for expedited passage. Mizrachi shared this idea on May 29 while speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas alongside other Bitcoin supporters from El Salvador. Panama City Mayor proposes Bitcoin payments for priority canal transit Mizrachi spoke on the panel alongside Bitcoin advocates, El Salvador government advisors Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert, and moderator Mike Peterson from Bitcoin Beach. He suggested that cargo ships waiting to pass through the Panama Canal can pay their transit fees in Bitcoin and get priority access. The mayor pointed out that this idea could position Panama as a leading digital finance and technology center and bring Bitcoin deeper into the country’s economy. The Panama Canal saves cargo ships weeks of travel time that they would have to spend if they sailed around the southern tip of South America because it links the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. The canal handles about 5% of all global maritime commerce, and nearly 10,000 ships passed through it between October 2023 and September 2024, carrying more than 423 million tons of cargo and generating almost $5 billion in revenue for Panama. Mizrachi’s idea comes at a time of political tension since President Donald Trump publicly demanded that the United States take back control of the Panama Canal in December 2024. Trump criticized the toll system by claiming that U.S. ships pay higher fees than ships from other countries and argued that China’s growing influence over the canal threatens American interests. The mayor’s idea to accept Bitcoin payments for faster canal transit in this complicated situation supports Panama’s digital growth goals. It makes the canal more competitive and efficient on the international trade stage. Panama City embraces Bitcoin for tax payments and proposes City-level crypto reserve Panama City approved a new rule that allows people and businesses to pay their municipal taxes, fines, and fees using Bitcoin and other digital currencies. This move shows that the city trusts digital currency and wants to give people more flexible ways to meet their financial obligations to the government. Mayor Mizrachi also proposed to create a dedicated Bitcoin reserve for Panama City to help stabilize its finances and attract new investment opportunities since the city contributes more than half of the country’s gross domestic product. He also said he could set up the reserve at the city level without waiting for the national legislature to pass any new laws. The mayor used strong language to warn lawmakers to avoid rushing into new rules that could slow progress or scare away innovation. He said, “Don’t touch it, don’t get near it, don’t even look at it,” emphasizing that the government should give Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies the space to grow naturally. Mizrachi told lawmakers to watch how people use Bitcoin over time and only bring rules that protect users or improve systems. Mizrachi said the country transacts over $5 billion in Bitcoin annually, but most of it remains hidden because many fear the legal or social risks of being open about their involvement with crypto. The mayor believes that making the system more open, transparent, and officially supported will encourage more people and businesses to come forward. The decision to adopt Bitcoin also comes amidst social and economic tension. Panama declared a state of emergency in the Bocas del Toro province following news that a well-known banana company, Chiquita, was laying off over 5,000 workers. Those employees were demonstrating for additional social security guarantees and improved working conditions.

After years of uncertainty, the government is preparing to release a discussion paper on crypto regulation in June. For a country that’s gone from heavy taxes to long periods of silence, this could be a defining moment. With the global market heating up and Bitcoin recently touching a new all-time high above $111,900, India’s timing is interesting. What’s in the paper? Will it invite public opinion? Could this be the start of a more structured approach to crypto in India? Let’s unpack what we know so far. Supreme Court Steps In: Silence is No Longer an Option The pressure isn’t just coming from the markets. India’s Supreme Court has strongly called out the government’s delay in addressing crypto regulation. It warned that the ongoing legal vacuum is creating space for misuse and made it clear that banning crypto isn’t the solution. A bench led by Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh questioned why, while other global economies are moving ahead with their own regulatory frameworks, India is yet to make a clear decision. This paper appears to be a direct response. According to reports, the government’s upcoming proposal will draw heavily from the IMF and Financial Stability Board’s recent synthesis report. There are also signs that it might open the floor for public input, giving stakeholders a chance to contribute to the process. India’s Journey So Far: Tax First, Clarity Later India’s crypto story has had its share of growing pains. The 2023 budget introduced a 30% tax on crypto profits, which pushed many users and exchanges to rethink their presence in the country. While firms were required to register with the Financial Intelligence Unit, the sector still lacks formal recognition. The Reserve Bank of India has remained cautious, often highlighting risks like money laundering and terror financing. At the same time, it has continued to promote its central bank digital currency as a safer alternative to private crypto assets. According to a recent report by think tank Esya Centre , nearly 90% of Indian crypto trading has moved offshore, largely in response to existing policies. Industry voices have warned that the current setup limits innovation and drives users toward unregulated platforms. Global Momentum Is Building – Can India Keep Pace? While India works through its roadmap, global powers are setting the tone. In the US, President Donald Trump has shifted the country’s stance with a bold pro-crypto approach. His administration has pardoned several digital asset leaders, backed a strategic bitcoin reserve, and seen the Senate pass stablecoin-focused legislation. Meanwhile, the European Union is already rolling out its MiCA regulation, setting clear rules for digital asset firms operating across its member states. A Defining Moment for India One senior Indian official noted that the country would approach crypto decisions with the national interest in mind, and avoid “knee-jerk” reactions. That could be key, especially in a market known for sudden shifts and global ripple effects.

2025-05-30T09:30:28.000Z,"Bitcoin Profit Taking Explodes: 12x More Gains Than Losses Hitting Exchanges","On-chain data shows the ratio between the Bitcoin profit and loss being sent to exchanges is approaching euphoric bull market levels. Bitcoin Exchange Realized Profit/Loss Ratio Has Shot Up Recently In its latest weekly report, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the Bitcoin transaction activity related to the centralized exchanges. While other modes of trading exist for BTC like over-the-counter (OTC) desks, the exchanges still act as the primary means of trade and speculation in the market. Given this, the volume related to these platforms can be looked at as a measure of the demand for participating in trading activity that exists among the investors. As the analytics firm explains, The volume of deposits and withdrawals to exchanges can be compared to the total volume settled on-chain, providing a tool for assessing the appetite of investors to trade Bitcoin. Below is a chart that shows the trend in this volume dominance of the exchange deposits and withdrawals relative to the rest of the network. As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin volume dominance of the exchanges has been witnessing an increase recently as the cryptocurrency has gone through its rally to a new all-time high , suggesting the demand for trading activity has been rising among the investors. At the moment, the exchange volume is making up for 33% of all transactions occurring on the BTC network. This level is higher than the peak from early 2025, but lower than the surge from Q1 2024. Clearly, investors are participating in a lot of trading currently, but what’s the nature of this activity? For the deposit side of things specifically, holder behavior can be broken down by separating between profit and loss transactions. Glassnode has done this by referring to on-chain data to check what price the coins involved in these transactions were moved at prior to this. The difference between this price and the exchange deposit price tells us about the amount of profit/loss realized with the move. Here is a chart that shows the data related to the average amount of profit/loss involved with exchange deposits on the Bitcoin network: From the chart, it’s apparent that spending behavior among Bitcoin investors has largely been profit-driven recently, with the profitable transactions involving an average realized gain of $9,300, far outweighing the $780 dollar in loss that the average loss coin is realizing in its deposits to exchanges. “This places the average profit at 12x larger than losses, which is pushing the ratio between the two near the extremes often seen in the most energetic stages of prior bull markets,” notes the analytics firm.

Bitcoin MVRV Ratio Yet To Surpass +1 SD Line In its latest weekly report, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how Bitcoin is currently looking from the perspective of the MVRV Ratio. The “MVRV Ratio” is a popular indicator that, in short, tells us about how the value held by the investors as a whole compares against their initial investment. Related Reading: Toncoin Open Interest Spikes 33%—Will History Repeat With A Pullback? When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means the holders are carrying more than they put in. In other words, they are in a state of net profit. On the other hand, the indicator being under the threshold suggests the overall network is underwater. The analytics firm has used the MVRV Ratio to define pricing bands that correspond to extreme deviations from the average investor profitability (that is, the mean value of the MVRV Ratio). These bands help point out periods where investor profits/losses are unusually high. Below is the chart shared by Glassnode in the report that shows the trend in these pricing bands for Bitcoin over the last few years. As displayed in the graph, the Bitcoin price has been trading above the mean level of this model since a while now. Recently, the asset has also broken above the +0.5 standard deviations (SD) line. This line corresponds to the price at which the MVRV Ratio attains a value that’s 0.5 standard deviations above the all-time mean. At present, the level is situated around $100,200. The level that BTC is yet to surpass in this latest rally is the +1 SD one, located at $119,400. From the chart, it’s visible that the cryptocurrency breaking above this line has generally led to a top for its price. The explanation behind this pattern lies in the fact that the larger investor profits grow, the more tempted holders become to take them. At extreme deviations of the MVRV Ratio, selling pressure from holders giving in to this temptation becomes significant, hence why the asset approaches a long-term top. In the current cycle, Bitcoin has breached the +1 SD level of the model on two occasions, ending up with the formations of the March 2024 and December 2024 peaks. For now, the current rally is still below this level, but above the +0.5 SD that also corresponds to a significant level of gains.

This liquidation was triggered by bitcoin’s dip below $105,000 early Friday. According to data from Arkham Intelligence, Wynn has been liquidated on four positions so far, totaling 1,134 BTC (over $118.8 million). He still has an open position with 40x leverage on the decentralized exchange (DEX) Hyperliquid, which is sitting on an unrealized loss of $4.7 million at the time of writing. $1B Bitcoin Bet Backfires CryptoPotato reported last week that Wynn built his 40x leverage long Bitcoin position from $390 million to $1.1 billion within seven days. Well-known as a high-risk leverage trader and meme coin maxi, the whale continued to increase his bets as bitcoin’s price kept rising. As BTC hit an all-time high (ATH) of $111,970 on May 22, the bet increased to $1.14 billion with an unrealized profit of over $39 million. By May 24, Wynn had pumped the bet to $1.25 billion, even as BTC had slipped from its ATH and was consolidating around $108,000 to $109,000.

Buying and Holding is Better: Wynn While Wynn took profits from his big BTC bet, he believed the asset could hit the $115,000 to $118,000 target this week. Unfortunately, the opposite is true. Bitcoin is down 2.5% in the past 24 hours and was trading around $105,093 at writing time. Due to bitcoin’s decline over the last few hours, Wynn has been liquidated in four positions holding 91 BTC ($9.7 million), 527 BTC ($55.3 million), 421 BTC ($43.9 million), and 95 BTC ($10 million). Data from the Hyperliquid analytics platform, Hypurrscan, shows that the liquidations were triggered when BTC hit $106,330, $104,950, $104,150, and $104,620, respectively. Addressing his liquidation on X, Wynn tweeted that his bets have exposed the corruption in the crypto market. He insisted it is better to buy and hold BTC in cold storage rather than follow his investment strategy. One thing for sure is that I have exposed just how corrupt these markets are. Guess it’s better to just buy and hold $BTC on spot / cold storage it. — James Wynn (@JamesWynnReal) May 30, 2025 The post Crypto Whale Wynn Who Bet $1B on BTC Gets Liquidated for $118M Amid Price Dip appeared first on CryptoPotato .",cryptopotato,https://cryptopotato.com/crypto-whale-wynn-who-bet-1b-on-btc-gets-liquidated-for-118m-amid-price-dip/,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|ARKM","AA News|BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|Bitcoin Whales",cryptocompare

Woo tells his 1.2 million followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin’s risk signal is trending downwards, an indication that the market risk is falling. According to the widely followed analyst, there’s an increase in liquidity from buyers, a fact which could push up the price of the crypto king. “We are setting up for another solid run on the long time frame.” Source: Willy Woo/X Woo, however, says that the strength of Bitcoin’s recent bullish run from the price of $75,000 reached around April 6th to the price of $112,000 recorded on May 22nd is beginning to weaken. Over the short term, the widely followed analyst says , “This week is absolutely critical, if we do not get follow through, then we will be up for another consolidation period.” Woo further says , “In the short term, my main concern are the late-comer speculators taking long positions while an immense amount of potential profit-taking is ready to dump (SOPR). This week’s spot buying will strongly influence the next 1-2 months of price action. We are in a pivot zone.” The SOPR, an acronym for the Spent Output Profit Ratio, is an on-chain metric used to determine market sentiment by revealing whether the Bitcoin that is moving is being sold at a loss or profit.

Payments-focused XRP dipped below the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) for the first time since April 10, indicating a strengthening of downward momentum. Prices fell below $2.20, registering 4.6% losses on a 24-hour basis, according to data source TradingView. The decline followed reports of increasing demand for XRP as a corporate Treasury asset. Prices for BTC, the premier digital asset by market value, briefly fell below $105,000 during European hours, extending overnight losses to trade nearly 3% lower on a 24-hour basis. BTC's losses followed a $358 million net outflow from the 11 spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) Thursday, their first since May 13 and highest single-day tally since March 11, according to data source SoSoValue . Renewed trade war fears also weighed over the sentiment.

The core PCE, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is forecast to have risen 0.12% on a monthly basis and 2.5% on an annual basis.

2025-05-30T09:06:56.000Z,"Bitcoin (BTC) ready for Next Surge, But Major Hurdle ahead","All short-term momentum indicators up to the daily timeframe are now in an oversold condition. This would suggest that Bitcoin (BTC) is about to make its next upside move. Nevertheless, a major hurdle is on the horizon in the form of the weekly Stochastic RSI, posturing a swing back down in the indicators that can potentially bring some future heavy downside price momentum. Caution is required. Keeping it simple in trading In the field of technical analysis there are countless charts and indicators that can point a price in one direction or another, and often, at any particular point in time. Therefore, one strategy that tends to iron out the often perverse market fluctuations over time is that of keeping things very simple. There are a small number of indicators for Bitcoin, that if used over the longer time frames, will generally help to show the main trend that $BTC is following, and give pointers as to when we need to sit up and take notice that a trend break is about to occur. The Stochastic RSI is one of the most reliable indicators in this respect. It is used to measure momentum and identify overbought or oversold conditions. On the higher, weekly time frame, the Stochastic RSI is exhibiting an overbought condition - thus the cause for concern. Before looking at the bigger picture, the shorter time frames are currently looking bullish. They are suggesting that there could be a nice upside surge that could develop into the weekend. Correction from all-time high still taking place Source: TradingView In the 4-hour time frame it can be seen that the correction from last week’s all-time high is still taking place. The bears were able to force the price below the important $106,000 support, and $BTC is now at the $105,000 support level. There is the possibility that the price could drop through here, but it isn’t expected. If it does, the furthest dip to the downside would likely be to the $102,500 horizontal support. What is more likely is that the price will start to bounce from here, and could then gain momentum from all the short time frame Stochastic RSI indicators crossing up from the bottom. The targets would be to break back above $106,000, pierce up through the descending trendline, make a higher high, and then have the possibility of getting back to the all-time high. 3-day chart shows concerns are beginning Source: TradingView The 3-day chart shows that concerns are beginning. The ascending trendline is in the process of being broken, and should the current red candle still be on the wrong side of this trendline by the end of Friday, the breakdown will be confirmed. Having said that, the horizontal supports are very important, and a close above $106,000 would be seen as a victory for the bulls. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI on this time frame is looking ominous, with the indicator lines shaping to fall back down through the 80.00 level, and by doing so, bringing downside price momentum with them. Weekly Stochastic RSI signals a potential cross-down Source: TradingView As already mentioned, the weekly time frame is potentially the most problematic at this point in time. While it can be seen that the price is starting to roll over, it’s at the bottom of the chart where things are starting to become a little worrying. The Stochastic RSI has the blue indicator clearly angled down, and it is posturing to cross over the red indicator line. However, it’s not all doom and gloom quite yet. If the expected rally does take place into the last part of this week, the indicator lines could just end up flatlining along the top, much as they did in a 3-week period at the end of 2024. That said, they will have to come down at some point, putting an end to the upside price momentum. Is there still time in this bull market cycle for the indicator lines to drop all the way back to the bottom and then come back up for one last hurrah into Q4? Yes there is. Also, the indicator lines could bounce along the top for an extended period of time. The main take away here is that when the weekly Stochastic RSI indicators are at the top it signals caution to long-term traders, whereas when they are at the bottom, buys are signalled.

2025-05-30T09:01:29.000Z,"Court flip-flop on tariffs rattles investors","Markets woke up rattled on Friday as the chaos surrounding President Donald Trump’s tariff decisions continued to wear down investor confidence. According to data from CNBC, futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 31 points in early morning trading, while S&P 500 futures slipped 0.16%, and Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 0.21%. This came after a wave of uncertainty on Thursday when a federal court first blocked and then reinstated the majority of the president’s tariffs, triggering confusion across global trade desks. The legal drama unfolded late Wednesday night when the Court of International Trade decided to freeze most of the current tariffs imposed by the administration. But by Thursday afternoon, that same court reversed course, putting a temporary hold on its own order. Stocks recoil as legal chaos deepens This constant policy flip-flop is throwing both markets and global trade partners into a loop. The S&P 500, which was up nearly 0.9% during early Thursday trading, turned south fast after the Trump administration hinted at a possible appeal. The issue isn’t just whether the tariffs are good or bad, it’s that nobody knows when they’re real. That’s paralyzing for companies trying to plan shipments and for countries negotiating trade deals. Even with the turbulence, stocks have had a solid May. The S&P 500 is still up more than 6% this month, the Nasdaq Composite has jumped 10%, and the Dow has added about 4%. For this week alone, the S&P has risen 2%, the Dow gained 1.4%, and the Nasdaq is up 2.3%. Traders are also watching closely for inflation data. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index for April is expected to show annual inflation at 2.2%, with a monthly increase of 0.1%. The core PCE, which cuts out food and energy, is projected to come in at 2.6% for the year, also rising 0.1% month over month. Crypto drops as investors brace for inflation Crypto markets weren’t spared either. Bitcoin dropped 2.8% and now trades at $105,430. Ether fell 4% to $2,617, XRP dropped 4.4% to $2.19, and Solana (SOL) tumbled 6%, now sitting at $162. The declines come as traders try to make sense of global economic signals that are increasingly impossible to predict. Source: TradingView But interestingly enough, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is currently at 60, which is strongly Greed. Retail investors aren’t feeling good about any of it. The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) said bearish sentiment jumped to 41.9% this week, up from 36.7% last week. That’s higher than the long-term average of 31%, and this marks the 26th time in 28 weeks that pessimism has outpaced the norm. On the flip side, bullish sentiment dropped to 32.9%, down from 37.7%, and sits below the historical average of 37.5% for the 16th time in 17 weeks. In a special question, 64% of respondents said that the tariffs, along with the economy and inflation, are the top reasons they expect markets to drop in the next six months. Only 11% pointed to corporate earnings, 10% to valuations, and 9% to monetary policy or interest rates.

Most cryptocurrencies are trading lower today as market uncertainty grows following a U.S. court’s decision to strike down President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs. The global crypto market cap has fallen 2.56% to $3.35 trillion, though investor sentiment remains in the “Greed” zone with a score of 61 on the Fear & Greed Index. The market jitters stem from a recent U.S. trade court ruling that deemed Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs illegal. This development raised fresh concerns about the stability of the U.S. trade policy and whether $16 billion in collected tariffs might have to be refunded. However, in a quick turn of events, a federal appeals court has temporarily paused the lower court’s ruling, allowing Trump’s tariffs to stay in effect for now.

As per local media reports , during a recent meeting official meeting on Finance and Revenue, Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal clarified that although the prime minister has established a Crypto Council, led by the finance minister through an executive order to explore digital asset policy, the country’s cryptocurrency ban remains firmly in place under regulations set by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) The central bank issued a directive in 2024 declaring Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies illegal, a position that remains unchanged. Pakistan’s Crypto Council CEO Bilal Bin Saqib, who was recently named as PM’s assistant on crypto and blockchain , announced at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas that the country is moving ahead with a Bitcoin reserve . Officials Highlight Crypto Policy Inconsistency Committee members voiced concern over the government’s inconsistency in regards to crypto policy, questioning why the public was being encouraged to invest in crypto despite its legal ban, warning that such actions could expose investors to serious risks. Recently Pakistan’s government announced to allocate 2,000 megawatts of electricity to power Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence (AI) data centres. Committee members raised questions about whether the bitcoin mining would be in government or private sector hands, and noted that illegal hawala channels would likely be replaced by unregulated digital transfers.

In response, Saylor drew an analogy to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), stating, “GBTC is a closed-end trust… a corporate entity that has no operational flexibility to manage its capital structure.” He emphasized that unlike GBTC, Strategy is an operating business with the ability to take on debt and manage its capital dynamically. Saylor argued that “for any company to fall down to below 1 mNAV, the shareholders have lost faith in the management structure of the business.” If Strategy’s stock “went to $1 tomorrow,” he said, the company would respond by selling its preferred stock or fixed income instruments STRK and STRF and use the proceeds to repurchase common stock, thereby recapitalizing the company. Highlighting the importance of flexibility, Saylor stated, “To create value, you need to create option value to generate as much optionality as possible. The more options, the greater the value.” He concluded by asserting, “The thing that makes our company a monster is having multiple at-the-market offerings (ATMs) in multiple capital markets,” underscoring Strategy’s multi-channel access to liquidity and financial resilience.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/30/michael-saylor-outlines-strategys-bear-market-playbook-at-bitcoin-vegas,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|STRK","Markets|Bitcoin|MicroStrategy|News",cryptocompare
2025-05-30T08:48:07.000Z,"Bitcoin Trader Loses Nearly $100 Million in Hyperliquid Long Bet Liquidation","James Wynn, a high-stakes trader on Hyperliquid , has suffered a near-$100 million loss after a series of leveraged long positions on Bitcoin were liquidated during a sudden market dip. Wynn, known for his aggressive trading strategies, saw his bold bets collapse on May 30 as Bitcoin’s price fell sharply below $105,000. Nearly 1,000 BTC Liquidated in Hours According to on-chain data from analytics platform Hypurrscan, two of Wynn’s largest positions were closed in quick succession. The first, a 527.29 BTC long valued at $55.3 million, was liquidated when Bitcoin dropped to $104,950. Moments later, another 421.8 BTC worth $43.9 million was wiped out as Bitcoin slid further to $104,150. These losses came on the heels of another 94 BTC ($10 million) liquidation on May 29 at $106,330. In total, Wynn lost 949 BTC — equating to approximately $99.3 million. Data from Lookonchain confirmed Wynn’s total losses over the past week hover just below the $100 million mark. Bitcoin reached to $105,000 on May 30, with some platforms reporting even deeper lows. Wynn’s positions were exposed to massive downside risk, as he had increased his 40x leveraged bet to $1.25 billion just days earlier, on May 24. That gamble backfired when the market reacted to geopolitical uncertainty and renewed tariff rhetoric from U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump. Wynn: “I Stand to Lose Everything” Following the dramatic liquidations, Wynn responded on X with a cryptic screenshot from The Matrix showing Neo stopping bullets — a subtle nod to the pressure he faced. Despite the losses, one of Wynn’s massive positions remains open: a 40x leveraged long contract entered at $107,993. According to Hypurrscan, it is currently showing an unrealized loss of $3.4 million. Wynn, who rose to fame after turning memecoin investments — particularly Pepe — into multi-million-dollar wins, appears unfazed by the volatility. A day before the liquidation, he described himself as an “extreme degenerate” and admitted to ignoring risk management. “I do not follow proper risk management… I’m effectively gambling. And I stand to lose everything,” Wynn warned — a candid reflection of the high-risk world of crypto leverage trading.

2025-05-30T08:46:25.000Z,"Bitcoin ETF Inflow Streak Ends After $347M Outflow Day","This latest outflow was the largest single-day outflow since March and ended a 10-day inflow streak. Fidelity’s FBTC and Grayscale’s GBTC led the outflows, while BlackRock’s IBIT stood out with a $125 million net inflow—its 34th straight day of gains. Meanwhile, spot Ether ETFs were able to stay resilient by drawing $92 million in inflows despite many holders being underwater due to ETH’s price decline. However, recent court decisions easing trade tensions revived sentiment. BlackRock has also been quietly increasing Bitcoin exposure via internal bond portfolios. Bitcoin Price Drop Triggers ETF Outflows US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded their first collective outflow in over two weeks on May 29, snapping a ten-day streak of net inflows. This was also the largest single-day outflow since March. The total net outflow amounted to $347 million, according to data from Farside Investors. This reflected the shift in market sentiment after Bitcoin’s price dropped by more than 3.5% during the day. The sharp price decline saw BTC fall from an intraday high of $108,850 to briefly dip below $105,000. Bitcoin ETF flow (Source: Farside Investors ) Among the ETFs, the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) registered the largest outflow after losing $166 million. This was followed by the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which shed $107.5 million. Other funds managed by Bitwise, Ark 21Shares, Invesco, Franklin Templeton, and VanEck also saw net outflows. However, funds like Grayscale’s mini Bitcoin trust, CoinShares, and WisdomTree experienced no flows. The only ETF to defy the trend was BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which attracted a net inflow of $125 million on the day. This was the fund’s 34th consecutive trading day of inflows, a streak that began after its last outflow on April 9. With nearly $4 billion in net inflows over the past two weeks alone, IBIT’s total inflows now stand at $49 billion, and its assets under management have surpassed $70 billion. ETF Store President Nate Geraci pointed out the divergence between crypto and traditional asset flows, and explained that more than $9 billion has entered spot Bitcoin ETFs in the past five weeks while nearly $3 billion exited gold ETFs during the same period. Meanwhile, spot Ether ETFs were more resilient during the Bitcoin pullback by posting a net inflow of $92 million on May 29. This extended their own inflow streak to ten consecutive trading days. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) led the charge with $50 million in net inflows, raising its total to $4.5 billion since its launch in July of 2024. Ethereum ETF flow (Source: Farside Investors ) Ether ETF Investors Deep in the Red Most investors in spot Ether ETFs launched by BlackRock and Fidelity are currently sitting on big unrealized losses. This is according to a new report from crypto analytics firm Glassnode. The report from May 29 found that the average investor in BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust and Fidelity’s Ethereum ETF is now down around 21%, with cost bases of $3,300 and $3,500 respectively. Ether is currently trading at approximately $2,610, which is well below these entry points. The decline in ETH’s price is partially attributed to macroeconomic pressures, particularly after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order imposing tariffs on imports from China, Canada, and Mexico. Ether last traded above $3,000 on Feb. 2, before entering a prolonged downtrend. The downturn intensified in April when the crypto hit a yearly low of $1,472 on April 9. This was the same day Trump’s global tariff package took effect. Glassnode’s analysis mentioned that outflows from Ether ETFs tended to accelerate when the asset dropped below the average investor’s cost basis, particularly during price declines in August of 2024, January, and March of 2025. However, a recent recovery provided some relief. ETH rebounded more than 44% over the past month, driven in part by easing fears around the trade war. On May 28, a US federal court blocked most of Trump’s tariffs, fueling optimism and contributing to nine consecutive days of inflows into Ether ETFs. ETH’s price action over the past month (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Since their US debut in July 2024, spot Ether ETFs have attracted close to $2.94 billion in inflows. At the time of their launch on July 23, Ether was trading around $3,536. Despite this capital influx, Glassnode noticed that the ETFs have had only a modest effect on Ethereum’s spot price. Initially, they accounted for just 1.5% of spot market trading volume. That figure rose to 2.5% in November 2024, coinciding with Trump’s re-election and a broader rally across the crypto market that briefly pushed ETH to $4,007 on Dec. 8. Since then, the ETFs’ market share slid back toward 1.5%. BlackRock Quietly Boosts Bitcoin ETF Holdings BlackRock has been steadily increasing its exposure to Bitcoin through internal portfolio allocations. According to recent filings with the US SEC, BlackRock’s Strategic Income Opportunities Portfolio held 2,123,592 shares of its own iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as of March 31, 2025. The position was valued at $99.4 million, which is a big increase from the 1,691,143 shares it held at the end of 2024. This move proved that Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a component of diversified return strategies, even in traditionally bond-heavy portfolios. The iShares Bitcoin Trust was launched in January of 2024 after the SEC’s approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs. It also very quickly became the dominant fund in its category. It currently manages over $70 billion in net assets, far outpacing its nearest competitor, Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), which trails by $50 billion. The Strategic Income Opportunities Portfolio is primarily focused on bonds but includes a mandate for seeking higher returns through exposure to a broad array of markets, including digital assets like Bitcoin. Institutional demand for Bitcoin ETFs are quite strong, with 2025 on track to mirror the explosive growth that was seen during the products’ first year. May has been particularly impressive, with spot Bitcoin ETFs attracting over $1.5 billion in net inflows in just two days. BlackRock’s IBIT played a central role in this trend by consistently recording sizable inflows since April 9. (Source: Bitwise ) Looking ahead, Bitwise Asset Management sees continued upside. In a recent report , its analysts projected that Bitcoin ETF inflows could reach $120 billion this year and potentially rise to $300 billion by 2026. Despite this robust growth, a major opportunity remains untapped. Bitwise shared that many traditional wealth management platforms and large wirehouses have not embraced Bitcoin ETFs just yet, which leaves a lot of room for even more institutional adoption in the coming years.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9373/bitcoin-etf-inflow-streak-ends-after-347-m-outflow-day,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

Bitcoin, the biggest crypto, smashed its new ATH of over $111,900 on May 22 before retracing back to the $105K levels. India to unveil crypto plan soon According to reports, the paper, which is expected to be released by India, will pull heavily from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) synthesis report. It might open the door for public input on how the country should handle the practices adopted by other jurisdictions. India’s take on crypto has been in the grey zone, as the Financial Year 23 budget imposed a harsh 30% tax on crypto gains, it stopped short of giving the sector legal recognition. Regulators have since forced exchanges to register with India’s Financial Intelligence Unit. Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of India has repeatedly flagged risks like money laundering and terror financing and even pushed its own CBDC as the safer option. The report mentioned that a senior government official said India will make its crypto decisions based on national interest, avoiding any “knee-jerk” reactions given the sector’s massive implications. Earlier, the Supreme Court of India slammed the central government for its long silence on crypto regulation. It warned that this legal vacuum is turning into a breeding ground for misuse. The court even grilled the government over when the biggest global economies are pushing forward with regulatory frameworks and India still hasn’t introduced any clear rules. A new report from think tank Esya Centre estimates that nearly 90% of Indian crypto trading has shifted offshore as a direct result of these regulations. It has eroded India’s foothold in the fast-expanding global crypto economy. Industry leaders warn that the current tax structure stifles innovation, pushes users toward unregulated markets. India’s top court demands crypto rules The US is doing some major reforms for the crypto community. Once a vocal crypto skeptic under Biden, Trump’s administration has pardoned several digital assets industry leaders and launched a strategic bitcoin reserve, and is pushing Congress to pass pro-crypto laws. Recently, Trump’s Senate passed stablecoin legislation; on the other hand, the EU’s MiCA regulation is already rolling out in real time. Against this backdrop, India’s Supreme Court said that it’s no longer acceptable to keep dodging the issue. A bench led by Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh highlighted that banning crypto isn’t the answer, but regulation is urgently needed. The cumulative crypto market cap registered a drop of more than 3% on Friday morning to stand at $3.31 trillion. Its 24-hour trading volume stood at $142.3 billion. After a brief rally, the Bitcoin price has stayed down by 5% over the past 7 days. One of the biggest gainers of the year, Ripple’s XRP price dropped by a huge 10% in the same period.

2025-05-30T08:44:19.000Z,"Samourai Wallet Files to Dismiss DOJ Case, Citing FinCEN Guidance","The co-founders of Bitcoin privacy app Samourai Wallet pushed back against the U.S. government’s criminal charges, arguing in a new court filing that the Department of Justice’s case should be thrown out because it breaks with years of Treasury Department policy and threatens to criminalize open-source software. Keonne Rodriguez and William Hill, charged with operating an unlicensed money transmitting business and conspiracy to commit money laundering, filed a joint motion asking a federal judge in Manhattan to dismiss the indictment. The pair's lawyers say Samourai Wallet never handled user funds and shouldn’t be considered a financial institution or a money transmitter under federal law. At the heart of the dispute is the distinction between custodial services, which take control of customer assets, and non-custodial tools like Samourai, which merely help users obscure blockchain transactions using a method called CoinJoin. According to the motion, Samourai users always retained control of their crypto, and the app simply coordinated privacy-enhancing transactions among them. The developers’ defense cited longstanding guidance from the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), that anonymizing software providers are not subject to money transmitter rules. “FinCEN never maintained that it was a money transmitting business that must be licensed. To the contrary, FinCEN consistently advised that companies and software apps that did not “accept” or “transmit” funds were not “money transmitting” businesses,” the filing reads. The defense argues that the Department of Justice’s charges mark a sharp and unprecedented break from that interpretation “in an apparent regulatory power struggle with FinCEN.” To them, the DOJ’s conduct is akin to “charging a shovel manufacturer because it may know murderers use shovels to bury victims” or “charging a burner phone manufacturer because it may know some customers use the phones to facilitate drug crimes.” In the motion, the lawyers warned that the DOJ’s theory could implicate a wide range of developers building privacy tools. Several crypto advocacy groups, including Coin Center and the DeFi Education Fund, have signaled interest in filing amicus briefs in support of the motion, warning that the case could chill innovation and infringe on civil liberties if allowed to proceed. The court is scheduled to hear arguments on July 22.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/05/30/samourai-wallet-files-to-dismiss-doj-case-citing-fincen-guidance,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY","Policy|Samourai Wallet|DOJ|lawsuits|US|News",cryptocompare

While altcoins like Dogecoin, Cardano, and Sui reflected the downbeat mood with substantial price dips, FTT remained in the spotlight as the defunct FTX exchange started distributing over $5 billion to creditors today. Whale Insider @WhaleInsider · Follow JUST IN: FTX to begin distributing over $5 billion in stablecoins to creditors today, with the process expected to start around 9:00 AM ET. 10:56 AM · May 30, 2025 161 Reply Copy link Read 66 replies The native token opened the day with a bullish note, rallying from $1.2196 to a 24-hour peak of $1.3074. FTT had tested the $1,30 mark several times in mid-May. Consequently, it formed a double-top setup, which indicates $1.30 – $1.35 as a crucial resistance. Bulls have failed to crack the obstacle again, and FTT retraced to hover at $1.22 during this publication. Its trading volume has declined by nearly 3% in the past 24 hours, indicating dwindled trader interest in FTX’s native coin. A new dawn for FTX and its creditors The bankruptcy crypto exchange is entering a crucial phase in its recovery process. FTX will start compensating its creditors stablecoins worth over $5 billion today, May 30. The payout is among the highest compensations in crypto history and will target institutional investors, retail users, and creditors who incurred substantial losses after the FTX empire collapsed in November 2022. The $5 billion release grabbed attention as among the top crypto events this week . First and foremost, it brings a sense of closure and relief, even as the future of the exchange and its native token remains blurred. Moreover, the massive payout will likely influence investor behavior, exchange flows, and liquidity in the near term. FTT price outlook FTX’s native token trades at $1.22, with its price performance reflecting uncertainty. Chart by Coinamrketcap The altcoin anticipates surged volatility amidst creditor payments. Meanwhile, bears appear to dominate short-term trends. Extended dips might send FTT toward the support barrier at $1.05 – $0.95. This region could attract buyers and trigger recoveries. However, FTT’s fate depends on how the recipients act after receiving their assets. Immediate selling would magnify the alt’s bearish outlook, possibly opening the downward path to $0.75. That would translate to a nearly 40% decline from the current market price. However, the altcoin can absorb prevailing bearishness if individuals opt to hodling. Overpowering the hurdle at $1.30 – $1.35 will likely propel FTT to the latest peak at $1.50, beyond which it will confirm solid short-term recoveries. Keep in mind that the native asset lacks use cases following FTX’s collapse. Therefore, some creditors might dump the assets and quit the market entirely. The upside path boasts multiple challenges for FTT. The altcoin’s short-lived recoveries indicate investor uncertainty about FTX and FTT’s future.

2025-05-30T08:22:34.000Z,"Best crypto to buy right now: Bitcoin Pepe closing as J.D Vance predicts 100M BTC users in US","The crypto market has been hot over the past months, with Bitcoin’s latest all-time high attracting global attention. With US Vice President J.D Vance forecasting continued BTC adoption in the United States, everyone seems interested in joining the craze. While institutions lead BTC adoption, viral Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) promises retail participants a chance to capitalize on the bellwether crypto’s growth, and with its official listing on May 31, its timing couldn’t be better. Bitcoin Pepe attracted investor attention since it introduced the first meme initial coin offering (ICO) on Bitcoin. The project has raised close to $12.4 million as investors intensify accumulation before BPEP hits exchanges after its debut. Source – Bitcoin Pepe US VP backs Bitcoin: users to double soon The Las Vegas Bitcoin Conference was among the most-watched market developments this week . Meanwhile, J.D. Vance stunned digital assets enthusiasts with his speech. The Vice President openly supported decentralized finance (DeFi) and Bitcoin. Vance praised Bitcoin for promoting innovation, privacy, and financial freedom while expecting more Americans to embrace crypto. He said : 50 million Americans own Bitcoin, and I believe that’s going to be 100 million before too long. Maestro @GoMaestroOrg · Follow 🇺🇸 Vice President JD Vance says, “50 million Americans own #Bitcoin — and I believe that’ll be 100 million before long.” 👏 Watch on Twitter View replies 11:49 PM · May 29, 2025 13 Reply Copy link Read 2 replies The remarks signal continued crypto adoption in the nation, matching Donald Trump’s vision of making the US a global hub for digital currencies. Moreover, he commented on crypto’s decentralization and an inflation hedge. That validates what the community believes, and the VP’s confirmation has likely bolstered confidence. Meanwhile, these statements indicate trust in Bitcoin’s potential growth in the upcoming years. Let us check how Bitcoin Pepe allows users to capitalize on BTC’s growth with diversified investment opportunities. Nothing stopping Bitcoin Pepe – CEX listing rumors swirl Bitcoin Pepe has been among the top crypto presales this year. Besides its meme appeal, the project stood out due to its trend, timing, and focus on utility. Thus, it remains a hot topic as its ICO nears the end. Insiders are already speculating potential centralized exchange listings after BPEP’s official debut. Though without confirmations, early signs show leading platforms are watching the altcoin due to its virility, fast-paced presale, and connection to Bitcoin. BPEP is not looking to rival Bitcoin. The low-cap asset tries to define what comes next. While projects like Ethereum and Solana have enriched their ecosystems with speculative activities such as staking, meme trading, and DeFi, BTC has stood as a store of wealth. Bitcoin Pepe wants to change that by unlocking BTC’s over $2 trillion dormant capital through speculative undertakings. The revolutionary project promises Solana-like features, with its PEP 20 standards allowing anyone to launch meme assets on the Bitcoin ecosystem. User-friendly exchanges such as OKX and Bybit could rush to list BPEP. That will open Bitcoin Pepe to a massive audience and possibly attract listing on other platforms like Coinbase and Binance. BPEP trades at $0.0377 and eyes a 1,000X rally after its official listing. Source – Bitcoin Pepe You can learn more about Bitcoin Pepe here .

2025-05-30T08:15:16.000Z,"BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Reaches Record Low Volatility, Draws Billions in Flows","BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust exchange-traded fund (IBIT) is experiencing record-low volatility, according to Senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas , which is attracting more interest from larger investors looking for a \""digital gold\"" rather than speculative tech-like behavior. The 90-day rolling volatility of 47.64 is the lowest since the ETF was introduced in January 2024, Balchunas posted on X, a degree of stability that can be self-reinforcing. As volatility drops, larger and more risk-averse investors tend to enter, which in turn further suppresses volatility. \""The thing with volatility is it can become self-fulfilling,\"" Balchunas said in his post. \""The lower the volatility gets, the more bigger investors will bite who will help lower volatility even more. The same 'should' happen with correlation too. This is a direct result of the ‘suitcoiners.’” The trend is already underway, Balchunas said, citing IBIT’s outsized inflows in recent weeks. Since its debut, IBIT has pulled in $49 billion in net inflows, more than four times the amount invested into the second-ranked Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), which has attracted less than $12 billion, data from Farside Investors show. In contrast, Strategy (MSTR), the software company that has made buying bitcoin BTC a strategic priority, operates on a different appeal. MSTR attracts speculators and options traders who thrive on higher implied volatility (IV). However, even MSTR’s IV has dipped recently to 60%, with historical volatility at 49%, contributing to its muted price action .",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/30/blackrocks-bitcoin-etf-reaches-record-low-volatility-draws-billions-in-flows,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY","Markets|Bitcoin|Bitcoin ETF|Volatility|BlackRock|News",cryptocompare
2025-05-30T08:15:00.000Z,"Bitcoin price prediction 2025-2031: Will BTC hit $150k soon?","Key takeaways : Bitcoin price faces bearish correction toward $105K Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction.

BTC price analysis 1-day chart: Bitcoin price hovers below $106K Analyzing the daily Bitcoin price chart, we see that BTC faced a surge toward $109K.

The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC’s price holds momentum above $108,944, it will fuel a bullish rally to $112,255. BTC/USDT Chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $104,718, beginning a bearish trend to $102,183. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin down today? Bitcoin faced a surge in bearish pressure after the price peaked at $109K. This triggered short-term holders to exit their positions, resulting in the recent decline. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price recently broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $100K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Following the US, Pakistan announced its first government-backed strategic bitcoin reserve, marking a notable step towards adding crypto assets into its financial strategy. Bitcoin price prediction May 2025 Bitcoin’s Q1 2025 performance was notably weak, with a 12.5% loss, as per CoinGlass data, marking the worst first quarter since 2018. In the last few weeks of April, the price of Bitcoin recovered smoothly and touched a high around $95K. Will Bitcoin continue its recovery rally in May? Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $91,000 and be pushed further, at least $108,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $85,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction May 2025 $85,000 $91,000 $108,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history | Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October.

In January 2024, the crypto OTC infrastructure firm Finery Markets reported that institutional OTC volumes jumped 106% last year.Cointelegraph approached Hidden Road for comment regarding the estimated OTC volumes globally and in the US, but had not received a response by the time of publication.Rising institutional demandIn December 2024, Higgins highlighted a rising demand for institutional balance sheets from large institutions in an interview with Finance Magnates.“Servicing them [institutional investors] across traditional finance and digital asset ecosystems that have already converged presents a really unique opportunity for us in the marketplace.”Hidden Road’s OTC swap launch in the US marks one of the first products launched by the firm since the company entered a definitive agreement to be acquired by Ripple.Related: Taurus, Parfin partnership to provide crypto infrastructure to institutionsSoon after the deal was announced, Hidden Road received a broker-dealer license from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, a private US corporation and self-regulatory organization regulating member brokerage firms and exchange markets.Hidden Road is also known as one of the first companies to receive a Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) license in Europe, immediately after the framework entered into full force on Dec. 30, 2024.

2025-05-29T13:30:00.000Z,"How African innovators are using blockchain to solve real problems","While blockchain headlines in the West often focus on speculation and regulation, in Africa, it’s a different story, one rooted in necessity, innovation and grassroots adoption. The latest episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast explores this ground-up revolution with Kevin Imani, head of StarkWare’s Africa Venture Studio, who shares how communities across the continent are using blockchain to tackle real-world problems in finance, energy and connectivity.A student movement“Young students were using blockchain before it was mainstream,” Imani explained. From Kenya to Nigeria, local needs, not hype, drove early adoption. In many cases, it was students receiving digital currencies from abroad or freelancers getting paid in dollars and struggling to convert funds into local currency. With limited banking infrastructure or trust in government institutions, decentralized alternatives offered a lifeline.Imani highlighted how centralized systems like Kenya’s E-Mpesa changed access to finance, but still fall short for international payments or off-ramping digital assets. Related: Blockchain.com expands in Africa as local crypto rules take shape“You have to start becoming a trader almost,” he said, describing the convoluted process of converting stablecoins or crypto earnings into usable local funds. This trust gap has fueled peer-to-peer crypto usage. “These were kids holding stablecoins not to spend them, but to store value.” Even before regulators or startups built formal infrastructure, communities had already found use cases for blockchain.Blockchain beyond finance Beyond finance, African innovators are tapping blockchain to address energy insecurity. In rural Zambia, excess power from a mini hydro station could go to waste. Instead, residents can now use that surplus to mine Bitcoin, for example, generating revenue and creating a sustainable power loop. “It’s self-sustaining and reduces waste,” Imani said.Connectivity is another frontier. In areas where traditional internet providers fall short, decentralized WiFi hotspot networks are emerging. With blockchain, community members can share bandwidth and be compensated instantly and transparently. “You don’t need a middleman. It’s fair and trackable,” he said.Still, mainstream adoption remains cautious. Governments like those in Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa are in “standby mode,” focused more on consumer protection than full-scale implementation. But Imani remains optimistic: “The need is there. The technology is here. The only question is how we bridge that gap.”To hear the full conversation on The Clear Crypto Podcast, listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

Sustaining this index in the “greed” zone since May 6 strongly indicates the positive sentiment the market players have for the wider crypto market.This pattern in market sentiment has been a precursor to price rallies in the past and could be an indicator of an upcoming bull run. Interestingly, the index is significantly lower than 82 in March 2024 and 94 in December 2024, marking the local tops. This suggests that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index could still rise into the “extreme greed” zone beyond 85, possibly pushing Bitcoin price toward new highs. Related: Bitcoin price will reach $130K or even $1.5M, top bulls sayBitcoin’s OI remains high post-ATHsOpen interest (OI) for Bitcoin futures contracts has seen marked growth since the sub-$74,000 local low in April, expanding to a record high of $80.5 billion on May 23 from $50.8 billion on April 8, according to CoinGlass data.The IO is currently at $78.4 billion, reflecting a $27.6 billion or a 54% increase over the last 50 days alone, suggesting a buildup of leverage ​​often accompanying bullish environments.Bitcoin futures aggregate open interest, USD.

2025-05-29T13:23:06.000Z,"Tim Berners-Lee says internet DNS should have been more decentralized","World Wide Web and hypertext markup language (HTML) inventor Tim Berners-Lee said that if he were building a domain name service (DNS) today, he would make it “more decentralized.”Speaking at ETH Prague on stage alongside Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, Berners-Lee reflected on early internet architecture decisions.“If I could go back […] I would make it more decentralized,“ he said.DNS was invented in 1983 by Paul Mockapetris, replacing the previous hosts.txt file-based system with a scalable, distributed system for naming IP addresses. Still, while Berners-Lee was not personally responsible for DNS development, he could have opted for a URL structure not tied to the DNS we know today, or he could have pushed for a decentralized alternative. Source: Mely.ethRelated: Decentralized naming could bring ‘next billion’ users to BitcoinCentralization of the DNSThe DNS system is highly centralized, particularly at its top levels of hierarchy. The root zone, which governs top-level domains such as .com and .org, is managed by the US-based nonprofit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).Furthermore, the most authoritative servers are operated by a handful of organizations, further centralizing the system. This allows for easy censorship and control by governments that can unilaterally seize or block domain names.This degree of centralization also makes outages due to centralized service disruption more likely. Control over root zones and domain policies is also concentrated in a few regions and among a select group of stakeholders.There are also concerns regarding privacy because centralized DNS queries can be monitored, logged and intercepted by internet service providers and other intermediaries.Related: Community split on ENS petition against Unstoppable Domains patentCrypto’s solution to the problemDecentralized alternatives to the DNS system are being developed. The most well-known is the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), which maps human-readable names to Ethereum addresses, content on the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS), or other data.Another alternative is Unstoppable Domains. Its system mints domains as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Ethereum and Polygon.ENS has seen a fair share of adoption. In late 2024, ENS Labs also partnered with PayPal and Venmo, sparking speculation about how this partnership is likely to boost mainstream adoption.IPFS runs on Ethereum smart contracts and aims to be user-owned and censorship-resistant. Currently, it is primarily used in Web3 applications, wallets and decentralized websites.Another alternative is Handshake (HNS), which aims to be a decentralized and permissionless naming protocol that is compatible with traditional DNS. A project with a similar aim is Namecoin (NMC), an early Bitcoin fork designed specifically to offer .bit domains and store DNS records onchain with censorship resistance.IPFS is also accompanied by its own Inter-Planetary Name System (IPNS), which enables mutable naming for IPFS addresses (hashes). URLs generated this way point to specific content, not servers.A non-crypto alternative to DNS is OpenNIC. This is a user-run project that offers non-ICANN domains, aiming to decentralize control through community governance.Magazine: Move to Portugal to become a crypto digital nomad — Everybody else is",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/tim-berners-lee-says-dns-should-have-been-more-decentralized?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-29T12:38:54.000Z,"No more ETH dumps? Ethereum Foundation turns to DeFi for cash","The Ethereum Foundation (EF) has borrowed $2 million in GHO, a decentralized stablecoin developed by Aave, in a move signaling deeper engagement with decentralized finance (DeFi) strategies.  In a May 29 X post, Aave founder Stani Kulechov said the foundation borrowed $2 million in GHO tokens. “The EF is not only supplying ETH to Aave, but also borrowing from Aave,” Kulechov wrote, describing the development as “the full DeFi circle.”GHO is a decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin native to the Aave Protocol. Unlike centralized stablecoins, GHO is governed by Aave’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which oversees interest rates, collateral requirements and facilitator selection. The move highlights the EF’s growing engagement with the DeFi ecosystem, moving toward more sophisticated treasury strategies. The foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Source: Stani KulechovEthereum Foundation previously deployed $120 million in DeFiThe foundation’s move to borrow GHO follows a previous $120 million deployment into various protocols, signaling a shift in how it manages its crypto holdings. In February, the EF deployed 45,000 Ether (ETH) across different DeFi protocols, including Aave, Spark and Compound. At the time, the Ether was worth $120 million. Kulechov previously described the fund deployment as the foundation’s “biggest allocation in DeFi.” Because of the move, the Aave founder said that DeFi will win, expressing optimism as the EF added liquidity to the protocol.Apart from Kulechov, community members also celebrated the move, supporting the EF’s ETH holdings management shift. A community member said the development was a win, saying the foundation should “keep it up,” while an X user said it would be positive if the EF continued to use their funds this way. Related: Ethereum Foundation unveils security initiative to supplant legacy systemsCriticisms of the foundation selling Ether In January, Ethereum community members called on the foundation to explore alternatives to selling ETH for operational funding. The community suggested DeFi tools like staking and borrowing stablecoins against ETH. Eric Conner, co-author of EIP-1559, criticized the ETH selling, saying that the foundation’s primary use case seemed to be dumping its holdings. He called the practice “insane,” urging the EF to stake or use DeFi instead of selling. Anthony Sassano, host of The Daily Gwei, proposed that the EF stake part of its ETH and sell the staking rewards. The community member also floated the idea of using Aave to borrow stablecoins against its holdings. Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-foundation-borrows-gho-defi-strategy?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-29T12:30:00.000Z,"Donut Labs raises $7M to launch first ‘agentic’ crypto browser","New York-based Donut Labs has raised $7 million in a pre-seed funding round to build what it claims is the world’s first “agentic” crypto browser — a tool designed to help users interact with blockchain-based applications using artificial intelligence.The round was led by Sequoia, Bitkraft and HackVC, with participation from angel investors including Solana and other ecosystem leaders, such as Matrix Partners, Sky9 Ventures, Makers Fund and SonicSVM.The $7 million will support the development of Donut, an executable crypto browser powered by artificial intelligence agents, with a native cryptocurrency wallet and decentralized exchange integration, decentralized network access and onchain execution.Unlike traditional web browsers, Donut’s AI algorithms understand page context and user intent, helping it autonomously execute blockchain-based operations.“The traditional browser hasn’t changed for more than 30 years. We’re re-architecting everything,” said Donut founder and CEO Chris Zhu. “We’re reconstructing the front end of the internet to be hyper-financialized for AI agents.”  Donut closes $7 million pre-seed round. Source: DonutRelated: Metaplanet’s Bitcoin ‘premium’ nears $600K per BTCDonut’s users will gain access to an array of decentralized tools and crypto services under a single agentic interface, which could make digital asset transactions safer.“Architecturally isolated signing environments and AI-powered risk screening secure every transaction while optimizing execution for speed and cost,” said Zhu, adding that “AI translates opaque calldata into plain English and assigns safety grades.”Donut’s AI agents can trade or swap tokens, place bets, or earn passive yield on digital assets.Related: Polygon-backed, high-yield blockchain launches for institutional adoptionAgentic browsers could reshape internet in next decadeWhile Donut’s earliest adopters will likely be crypto traders, builders or decentralized finance (DeFi) users, agentic browsers may explode into the mainstream during the next decade.Within the next five years, Ethereum layer-2 (L2) networks will use agentic browsers to cut settlement costs. Mainstream browsers will also integrate agentic capabilities or build interoperability with purpose-built agentic browsers as AI becomes cheaper, according to Zhu.However, the most significant adoption will come within the next decade when onchain and offchain environments will be completely merged for internet users, Zhu said, adding:“Agentic browsers are poised to become the default entry point — much like smartphones replaced feature phones.”In the long term, Donut aims to support payments, gaming, content creation and social interaction, all within a single crypto-native browser. The company also plans to leverage advancements in decentralized identity and confidential computing to turn the browser into a personal “crypto CFO” for retail users.

SOL/ETH weekly price chart. Source: TradingViewFor SOL/ETH, this projects a downside target for July, near 0.038 ETH, representing a 40% decline from current levels.The 50-week exponential moving average (50-week EMA; the red wave) around 0.0628 ETH is offering interim support. A decisive weekly close below this level would likely confirm the bearish continuation toward the 0.038 ETH target.A bounce, on the other hand, could have SOL reclaim the wedge’s lower trendline as support, which may delay the breakdown scenario. Breaking above the wedge’s upper trendline will likely invalidate the 40% crash setup altogether.Cooling memecoin frenzy hints at SOL/ETH crashThe breakdown in SOL/ETH aligns with a visible decline in memecoin-driven activity on Solana. A key indicator is Pump.fun, the largest memecoin launch platform on the network, which shows a sharp drop in daily fee revenue since early April. Daily fees peaked in Q1 2025 but have since fallen to near-yearly lows, signaling reduced speculative activity on the chain, according to Dune Analytics.Pump.Fun fee and revenue chart.

During this period, total cumulative fees surged past 3 million SOL as retail traders flooded the network to launch and trade meme tokens. These metrics have crashed ever since, weakening one of Solana's primary value drivers.A May 27 report from Standard Chartered further reinforces the downside narrative.
