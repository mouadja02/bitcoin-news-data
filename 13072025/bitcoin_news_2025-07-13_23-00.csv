This comes after Strategy raised $4.2 billion in capital, an indication of sustained trust in BTC during short-term accumulation pauses. “Some weeks, you don’t just HODL,” Saylor tweeted Sunday, referencing the return of aggressive buying since the record 12-week buying spree in BTC ran out last week. Largest Corporate BTC Holder Vouches for Its Commitment Strategy’s latest Bitcoin purchase was on June 30, when 4,980 BTC were purchased at a cost of $532 million. The corporation’s holdings were then at 597,325 BTC, which is now worth over $70.9 billion. The firm remains the largest corporate owner of Bitcoin and still finances purchases with debt and equity instruments – a bold strategy that makes it the leader of Bitcoin treasury companies. Treasury Demand Outstrips BTC Mining Supply BitcoinTreasuries data shows that BTC treasury companies bought 159,107 BTC in Q2 2025 – more than double the approximately 13,500 per month mined. Strategy alone has accumulated 379,800 BTC in the past six months, or about 2,087 BTC per day. “The company is effectively halving Bitcoin,” wrote Adam Livingston, author of The Great Harvest. “Strategy is rapidly passing miners and may become an economic superpower soon.” Market Impact and Sustainability Concerns Strategy’s speed of rapid acquisitions is reshaping the Bitcoin market. With miners taking out about 450 BTC every day, and big firms buying at a higher rate, experts warn of a potential supply shock. While this would drive prices up, the debt-financed nature of such purchases raises long-term sustainability concerns. Nevertheless, investor demand is still present. Strategy stocks are up more than 16% this month, trading at about $434 – though still well short of the November 2024 peak of $543.",btcpulse,https://btc-pulse.com/michael-saylor-hints-at-new-bitcoin-buy-as/,"BTC|REGULATION|MARKET|BUSINESS|MINING","Bitcoin|Regulation",cryptocompare

2025-07-13T20:00:14,"Macro Guru Luke Gromen Predicts US Dollar Devaluation, Says Government Will ‘Sacrifice’ USD Amid High Debt Levels","Macro strategist Luke Gromen warns that the US dollar will keep losing value amid a ballooning $36.60 trillion national debt. In a new YouTube update, Gromen says the US, with its record-level national debt, is now forced to choose between sacrificing the bond market or letting the dollar fall to maintain financial and economic stability. According to the macro expert, the US government will ultimately resort to debasing the dollar by printing more money to manage its debt, rather than allowing Treasury yields to soar in an effort to attract investors. “What we’re seeing in these bond markets, US and more importantly for the moment Japan and the UK, is a choice. You got to sacrifice your currency or you to sacrifice your bond market. And our view, really the base underpinning of our view why gold and Bitcoin are trading where they are trading, is they always choose to sacrifice the currency… Because if they sacrifice the bond market and let rates just go up and up and up, given their debt levels, they ultimately end up sacrificing both: the currency and the bond market because higher rates drive receipts down and interest up and that means interest quickly goes above your receipts. And when that happens, that drives essentially hyperinflation of the currency. Either they can’t pay the bonds and the bonds back the currency or more likely, they print the money just to pay the interest and drive a version of hyperinflation. So they always choose to sacrifice the currency over sacrificing the bond market when debt levels are high as they are and that’s why, because sacrificing the bond market only buys them a little bit of time, and they ultimately end up sacrificing both.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-13T19:49:40,"STELLAR PRICE ANALYSIS & PREDICTION (July 12) – XLM Advances Bullishly Despite Slight Pause in Buying, Adds Another 30% Daily Gain","While buying pressure slowed down across the crypto space since yesterday, XLM defied odds and continued to explode daily. It has seen a slight rejection today, but remains highly bullish on the day. This month started relatively calm for XLM after undergoing a major retracement for straight five weeks. But things later turned out positive as the price began to increase at the start of the week. Although few altcoins have taken a brief break in bullish as Bitcoin tapped a new all-time high on Thursday. Instead, it continues to gain traction and even exploded to a new multi-week high today. Facing twice rejections on the way up, it slowly approaches a key monthly resistance level, where a major rally is likely to take place. A clear break there should set the stage for a huge upward movement in the short term. Technically, the bears are currently off the market as demand outweighs supply. An increase in the supply level could lure the bears back in the market. But for now, there’s no sign of a drop. Having mirrored XRP’s price movement in the past few days, XLM is now looking super bullish again as it signals a trend shift with a double-bottom formation on the daily chart. XLM’s Key Levels to Watch Source: Tradingview Now that the price approaches the $0.444 resistance level, we can anticipate a surge to the $0.51 level, followed by the $0.647 level in the future. A strong rejection under the mentioned resistance level could trigger a pull back to the $0.334 level before resuming the rally. Lower pullback levels to watch are $0.285 and $0.25. Holding the monthly $0.217 low as support, $0.15 is the next level to Watch in case of a dip. Key Resistance Levels: $0.444, $0.51, $0.647 Key Support Levels: $0.334, $0.285, $0.25 Spot Price: $0.4 Trend: Bullish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

GameSquare’s Offering In a July 8 press release , the company announced it has priced an underwritten public offering of 8,421,054 shares of its common stock at $0.95 per share. The offering is expected to raise approximately $8 million in gross proceeds before deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and other offering expenses. The Minneapolis-based firm said the funds will be used to kickstart a $100 million Ethereum treasury strategy. The initiative is aiming for yields between 8% and 14%, which is higher than the current 3% to 4% returns offered by regular ETH staking. “Today’s announcement reflects the confidence of a proven group of high-quality investors and leaders in decentralized finance,” said GameSquare CEO Justin Kenna. He expounded that the plan will increase the company’s financial flexibility and support a clear capital allocation plan focused on acquiring more ETH, funding potential share repurchases, and reinvesting in growth initiatives. GameSquare’s ETH treasury will be supported by a strategic alliance with Dialectic, a crypto-native capital management firm. This platform uses machine learning, strong risk controls, and automated optimization to deliver better risk-adjusted returns. Lucid Capital Markets is also serving as the sole underwriter for the plan. “We’ve partnered with one of the world’s top crypto investment firms to generate real, on-chain yield while deepening our expertise in decentralized finance, pursuing new revenue streams, and strengthening our balance sheet,” explained Kenna. The next-gen media and entertainment platform also said that its treasury may include other yield-generating strategies in the Ethereum ecosystem, including using stablecoins and NFTs to increase and diversify returns. Following the announcement, its share price jumped by nearly 60%. According to Google Finance data , the stock opened at $0.99, surged to a year-high of $1.69, before closing at $1.54. More Firms Shift to Ethereum The GameSquare news came as SharpLink Gaming, the largest corporate holder of ETH, added 7,689 ETH worth $19.2 million to its portfolio. The company now has a total of 205,634 ETH in its reserves, which it previously said is committed to staking and restaking protocols. Sharplink has also introduced a new performance metric, ETH Concentration, which increased by 19% over the past three weeks. Several other companies are now adopting Ethereum-based strategies. Bit Digital recently revealed it had transitioned its treasury to Ethereum, accumulating over 100,000 ETH. This move followed a $172 million public equity raise and the sale of 280 BTC. CEO Sam Tabar said the move shows a long-term belief in the cryptocurrency’s programmable features and staking yield model, calling it the future of digital assets.

2025-07-13T19:30:25,"Bitcoin Stalls After Rally: Will It Blast Through $125,000 Or Slip Back To $110K?","After a powerful breakout last week that pushed Bitcoin into a new all-time high of $118,667, the world’s leading cryptocurrency appears to be taking a breather. As of the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $117,953, slightly below its recent peak. The move followed a string of consecutive daily gains as bullish momentum swept across the crypto industry. In a technical analysis shared on the TradingView platform, crypto analyst RLinda pointed out two scenarios that may play out over the coming days and weeks, depending on how Bitcoin reacts to nearby resistance and support levels. Related Reading: Don’t Hold Back—Expert Recommends Full Stake In XRP Support Zones Could Affect Bitcoin’s Next Big Move RLinda’s technical analysis begins with identifying the significance of Bitcoin’s recent all-time high. Although Bitcoin has entered what seems to be a consolidation phase, there’s no confirmed top just yet. The market structure still favors bullish continuation, especially considering Bitcoin is just coming out of a prolonged two-month consolidation zone and entering a realization phase. According to the 1-hour candlestick price chart, Bitcoin is currently trading just above a support area below $117,500. If Bitcoin fails to hold this zone, the leading cryptocurrency could kick off a cascade of corrections that could drive the price to $115,500, then potentially to $114,300, and even back to the previous all-time high of $111,800. Below that, the 0.5 and 0.705 Fibonacci levels around $113,031 and $111,960 respectively may act as temporary cushions. The last major defensive buy zone is around $110,400, where bulls may step in for a bounce. Basically, what this means is that if Bitcoin loses the support level at $115,500, it could slip back to $110,000 before encountering another strong buy support zone. Image From TradingView: RLinda Bitcoin To $125K, But It Must Breach Resistance First On the other hand, Bitcoin can still push above $118,000 and increase to $125,000, but only under certain conditions. The condition of the rally’s continuation depends primarily on Bitcoin registering a decisive daily close above $118,400 and $118,900. In her words, a daily close above these price levels would hint at a “breakout of structure.” This, in turn, would confirm a transition from consolidation into another impulsive phase upward. In essence, both the bearish and bullish outlooks depend on how Bitcoin reacts at any of the important zones, either support at $116,700 or resistance above $118,400 before making a directional move. However, it is important to note that the consolidation after last week’s rally could last for weeks or even months, much like we’ve seen in previous rallies this cycle. According to the Long-Term Holder Net Unrealized Profit and Loss (NUPL) metric from Glassnode, Bitcoin’s current level of long-term profitability sentiment is at 0.69. This is notably below the 0.75 mark associated with euphoric market conditions, despite Bitcoin having just printed a new all-time high. Image From X: Glassnode Related Reading: Analyst Sounds The Alarm: Shiba Inu Primed For Over 1,500% Breakout Bitcoin spent around 228 days above the 0.75 euphoria threshold in the previous bull market cycle. In contrast, this current cycle has only seen about 30 days above that level, which suggests long-term holders have not yet fully exited into profit and the leading cryptocurrency hasn’t reached overheated conditions.

Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solana-price-prediction/,"SOL|TRADING|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET","Crypto Price Predictions|Solana",cryptocompare

Zero Hash provides the backend infrastructure that enables banks, brokerages and fintech companies offer cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and other digital assets to their customers. Citing sources familiar with the matter, Fortune reports that Zero Hash is poised to raise about $100 million at a nearly $1 billion valuation in a new funding round spearheaded by Interactive Brokers. In 2022, the startup raised $105 million in a Series D round that saw the participation of the private investment firm Bain Capital, American hedge fund Point72 Ventures and fintech venture capital firm Nyca. Citing data from PitchBook, Fortune reports that Zero Hash was valued at $340 million after the Series D capital raise. The latest push to raise additional capital comes amid the growing popularity of stablecoins – cryptocurrencies which are pegged to another asset such as the US dollar or commodities. In 2022, the payment processing company Stripe tapped Zero Hash’s infrastructure to launch an embeddable and customizable fiat-to-crypto on-ramp solution. And in 2024, Zero Hash teamed up with Securitize, a real-world asset tokenization platform, to allow qualified institutions to convert the USDC stablecoin into US dollars.

2025-07-13T18:30:22,"Bitcoin May Land On 36 More Company Balance Sheets This Year, Blockchain Firm Says","Public firms around the globe have been piling into Bitcoin this year. According to Blockware Intelligence, the number of public companies holding Bitcoin jumped by 120% in 2025. That surge brought the total to 141 firms. And by the end of 2025, at least 36 more are expected to add Bitcoin to their balance sheets. That would represent a 25% boost from today’s numbers. Rising Tide Of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Based on reports from Blockware’s Q3 2025 market update , three dozen new entrants could join the so‑called “Bitcoin Treasury Companies” over the next six months. These firms act as a bridge between traditional markets and the crypto world. In the first half of the year, companies big and small added more than 159,107 BTC to their books, setting a new record for corporate crypto purchases. Big Names Still Lead The Pack The top spot remains with US President Donald Trump’s favorite crypto advocate Michael Saylor’s Strategy , which holds a staggering 597,325 BTC. That figure is roughly 12 times what second‑place MARA Holdings owns, at about 50,000 BTC. Those two alone account for most of the Bitcoin held by public companies. Some Players May Be Taking A Risk Blockware points out that many newcomers are either brand new companies or ones that face tough business challenges. For firms with low growth or shrinking markets, parking cash in Bitcoin at an estimated 40 to 50% compound annual growth rate can look more appealing than running a struggling operation. But that choice comes with its own risks. Corporate Bitcoin Growth Faces Warning Signs Glassnode’s lead analyst James Check sounded an alarm on July 4, warning that the easy upside might already be gone for latecomers. Venture firm Breed outlined a “death spiral” risk for companies trading close to net asset value. Some crypto traders echoed that view, saying these firms will be tested in the next bear market, especially if NAV premiums start to slip. For now, the move toward Bitcoin is very real. Larger, well‑capitalized companies may weather the ups and downs better than smaller players. Investors and analysts will be watching how these treasuries perform when markets cool off. If premiums hold, new entrants could keep the momentum going. If not, some balance sheets may face a rough ride.

2025-07-13T18:24:27,"Chart of the Week: 'Hyperbitcoinization' May Not Be Just Maximalist Fantasy Anymore",""" Hyperbitcoinization "" — an almost apocalyptic term evoking end-of-days fiat collapse and bitcoin’s parabolic rise to global reserve status — is increasingly being discussed in more serious circles. For hardcore bitcoin maximalists, it's long been the ultimate scenario: a financial utopia where individuals, institutions and even nations are all-in on a bitcoin-only system as the fiat-based economy collapses. While we aren't there yet, the recent events might suggest something is brewing. Bitcoin is trading at record highs above $119,000 . The market cap of bitcoin is near that of the tech giants . The U.S. dollar is continuing its slow bleed in real purchasing power. Major institutions are allocating capital to BTC with the same risk-adjusted lens they apply to traditional assets. If hyperbitcoinization once sounded like ideological fiction, it’s now likely approaching early-stage reality. ""In prior BTC bull markets, the hyperbitcoinization thesis would have been limited to crypto enthusiasts. More recently, hyperbitcoinization-adjacent conversations have become much more palatable for the broader public,"" FRNT Capital said in an emailed note. From trenches to the front line Just a few years ago, no one thought the likes of BlackRock would be creating an exchange-traded fund for the masses to buy billions in bitcoin. Today, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is a juggernaut with 706,008 bitcoin under its belt, worth $82 billion, according to BitcoinTreasuries.Net data . Large companies are raising funds to buy bitcoin for their balance sheets. Political leaders, including a pro-crypto U.S. president, are floating the idea of national bitcoin reserves (whether that will come to fruition is still up for debate). Even a U.S. housing regulator is considering whether crypto holdings could be considered for mortgage applications — a potential signal that digital assets are becoming part of core financial infrastructure, or at least that those currently in power would like to see that happen. And of course, Wall Street has already claimed bitcoin with ""Tradification"" of the digital assets. The ownership shift The chart below makes an interesting observation about a potential ""hyperbitcoinization"" that may already be well underway. From 2014 till at least 2020, bitcoin has been held by mostly individuals. But fast forward to today, a massive number of companies, funds and even governments, as opposed to individual crypto enthusiasts, are holders of bitcoin while prices continue to rally to new highs. This shift in wallet distribution suggests that hyperbitcoinization, while not fully realized, is progressing from an ideological thesis to a potential observable market behavior. In a market that is increasingly driven by narrative momentum and liquidity rotation, hyperbitcoinization may not just be a theme — it might become the trade. ""Conceivably, as the hyperbitcoinization thesis is validated in practice and gains further mainstream attention, more BTC investors will be motivated to HODL. This does not apply just to individuals, but to institutions and nations alike,"" said FRNT.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/13/chart-of-the-week-hyperbitcoinization-may-not-be-just-maximalist-fantasy-anymore,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|FIAT|BUSINESS","Markets|Bitcoin|Maximalist|market analysis|News",cryptocompare

Since November 18, 2022, the government has purchased 1 BTC a day, bringing the total to 969 Bitcoin. The $54.15 million investment is now worth $115.18 million. BTC purchased at an average price of $55,886 currently represents an unrealized profit of 113%. The government's total Bitcoin holdings have reached 6,236 BTC, worth approximately $740 million. El Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele continues to defend his country's cryptocurrency policies and downplay criticism. He has recently targeted the “El Salvador Accountability Act of 2025,” a bill introduced by US Democratic Senators Tim Kaine, Chris Van Hollen, and Alex Padilla. Related News: Bitcoin's Weekend Breakout: Price Breaks All-Time High Record Again - Here's What We Know The bill aims to investigate whether the Salvadoran government is using cryptocurrencies as a “tool of regime corruption” and freeze the country's assets if necessary. Bukele responded to the proposal with a sarcastic post on the social media platform X. Bukele has previously targeted numerous authorities on social media, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Venezuelan government. This time, he targeted US senators and didn't hold back from belittling those who criticized his policies. Bukele's responses aren't limited to social media. His recent rapprochement with former US President Donald Trump is also noteworthy. Trump supported the detention of some deportees from the US in El Salvador's mega-prison. This development suggests a new shift in Bukele's foreign policy stance. *This is not investment advice.

According to his tweet on July 11, he purchased another Bitcoin at $110,000. Related Reading: Analyst Sounds The Alarm: Shiba Inu Primed For Over 1,500% Breakout Based on reports, he’s betting that today’s price will look cheap if Bitcoin ever hits $1 million. His choice puts him in what analyst Raoul Pal calls the “Banana Zone,” where fear of missing out drives latecomers to buy at the top and then suffer losses. Bitcoin Betting At High Prices Kiyosaki used his “PIGs Get Fat. HOGs Get Slaughtered” rule to explain why he bought at such a high level. He plans to hold until less disciplined investors push prices even higher and then sell when they panic. He warned that FOMO is like a disease that spreads fast through crowded markets.

He said he waited too long to learn about modern money before jumping in. That lesson stuck. He’s open about past mistakes and uses them to guide current moves. He figures that if Bitcoin reaches $1 million, he’ll regret not adding more at $110,000. Learning From Past Mistakes Kiyosaki recognized he “could be wrong and a sucker” after buying another Bitcoin, yet he added that he’d “rather be a sucker than a LOSER if Bitcoin does go to $1 million.” He noted that he can handle a $100,000 loss thanks to his past work and savings. That safety net gives him room to ride out sharp drops—dips of 30–50% happen in crypto all the time. Advice For Small Investors He urged readers to pick up bits of Bitcoin however they can. “Even if you can afford only one Satoshi today, buy it,” he said. A Satoshi is one hundred millionth of a Bitcoin. Based on those remarks, he expects newcomers to look back and wish they’d snapped up every chance to buy.

2025-07-13T17:57:20,"AI predicts XLM price for July 31 after 85% spike","Stellar ( XLM ) is breaking out alongside the broader cryptocurrency market , with an artificial intelligence (AI) model forecasting a potential push past the $0.50 resistance level by the end of July. As of press time, XLM was trading at $0.46, up 20% in the past 24 hours and 86% over the last week. XLM one-week price chart. Source: Finbold Amid the rally, Finbold consulted OpenAI’s ChatGPT model, which outlined several possible price scenarios for the cross-border payment token. In a bullish case, driven by continued market strength or positive project developments, XLM could climb to between $0.55 and $0.62. A neutral scenario might see the price consolidate between $0.42 and $0.48, potentially retesting the support level. However, ChatGPT noted that if momentum fades due to a Bitcoin ( BTC ) cooldown or profit-taking, XLM could retreat to the $0.35 and $0.40 range. The AI model’s base case assumes Bitcoin remains above the $115,000 to $119,000 range and that altcoin sentiment stays strong. Under these conditions, XLM could reach $0.55 to $0.58 by the end of the month. If Bitcoin’s dominance rises or investor risk appetite weakens, XLM may struggle to maintain its current levels and drop toward $0.40. Technically, the AI model noted that support lies between $0.35 and $0.38, a zone that previously acted as resistance. On the upside, $0.50 remains a key psychological barrier, with further resistance at $0.60 to $0.65 levels last seen in early 2022. ChatGPT XLM price prediction for July 31. Source: ChatGPT Drivers of XLM rally Overall, XLM’s ongoing strength has been fueled by Bitcoin’s record-breaking surge above $119,000 and renewed interest in altcoins. Beyond the broader rally, a key catalyst was PayPal’s announcement to integrate its stablecoin PYUSD on the Stellar network, pending regulatory approval. The July 11 announcement triggered a 20.5% intraday volatility spike, pushing XLM from $0.345 to $0.416 as traders priced in future demand and liquidity. Despite the bullish momentum, the AI model cautions that XLM’s sharp 86% weekly gain could prompt a short-term correction if not supported by strong fundamentals and sustained volume.

2025-07-13T17:12:53,"Expert Says XRP Is Peeking Out of the Bull Flag. Here’s the Significance","XRP is once again commanding attention as it flashes a powerful bullish signal on the 4-hour chart. Prominent analyst XRPunkie pointed out that XRP is “peeking out of the bull flag”—a classic continuation pattern often seen just before a major upward move. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.83, marking a significant push higher after a brief period of consolidation. Bull Flag Breakout Suggests a Strong Continuation The bull flag is one of the most reliable chart patterns in technical analysis. It forms when an asset rallies sharply, then enters a downward-sloping consolidation range, creating the “flag”, before breaking out in the direction of the initial trend. XRP has followed this exact structure. After surging from below $2.50 earlier this month, the price entered a tight flag pattern. Now, as XRP breaks above the upper boundary of this flag around $2.78, momentum is clearly shifting back in favor of the bulls. Ooooooo……. $XRP on the 4hourly candle is peeking out of the bull flag…. pic.twitter.com/nOZtrHWqyq — XRPunkie (@Shawnmark7899) July 13, 2025 This breakout is more than just a technical nuance, it reflects growing market strength. As noted by XRPunkie, the breakout signals that buyers are stepping back in, likely setting the stage for another leg up. If momentum continues, XRP could soon retest the upper resistance zone between $2.90 and $3.00. Key Levels to Watch XRP’s climb from below $2.50 to its current price of $2.83 represents a rally of more than 13% in under two weeks. This latest breakout places XRP in a critical zone. The immediate resistance lies near $2.90, followed by the psychologically important $3.00 mark. A strong close above $3.00 could open the door to a longer-term breakout and much higher targets. On the downside, the $2.78 level, where the flag breakout occurred—now acts as near-term support. If XRP remains above this level, it would further validate the bullish setup. However, if the price slips back below $2.70, it could signal a failed breakout and further consolidation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Conditions Support the Rally XRP’s breakout isn’t happening in isolation. The broader crypto market is flashing strength, with Bitcoin trading above $118,000 and altcoins showing renewed momentum. XRP’s bullish structure is also backed by positive fundamentals. Whale accumulation is growing, exchange balances are dropping, and wallet activity is on the rise , all pointing to increased demand and long-term holding. Additionally, excitement is building around the upcoming ProShares XRP Futures ETF, which is scheduled to launch on July 18. This development could drive further institutional interest, adding fuel to XRP’s recent rally. XRP’s breakout from the bull flag pattern is a strong technical signal that the uptrend is likely to continue. As emphasized by XRPunkie, the move out of consolidation marks a turning point for XRP on the lower timeframes. With the price now holding at $2.83 and momentum building, all eyes are on the key resistance zone between $2.90 and $3.00. If this level is cleared, XRP could be on the verge of a major breakout, one that finally propels it beyond the shadow of past highs and into a new bullish phase.

Cuban national Michel Duarte Suarez has pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and mail fraud and one count of aggravated identity theft after stealing about $803,000 from his victim’s bank account over a four-month period. Court documents show that Suarez told a confidential informant in March 2022 that he had access to the account of an 82-year-old victim. While living in Panama at the time, the scammer wrote and sent checks to South Florida with instructions to his co-conspirators to encash the checks and wire 50% of the funds to Suarez’s Miami-based firm, Online Electronics. Authorities say that Suarez forged the checks to resemble the signature of the victim displayed on their signature card for the same bank account. Suarez was arrested in January 2025 in Panama and was extradited to South Florida to face the charges. For his crimes, he could spend 30 years behind bars plus a mandatory consecutive two-year sentence to any imprisonment term handed down by a judge. The fraudster is slated for sentencing on September 29th, 2025, in Miami before United States District Court Judge Kathleen M. Williams.

The new high in bitcoin price comes as President Donald Trump said late Friday on Truth Social that the U.S. will impose 30% tariffs against imports from the EU and Mexico The new tariff headlines didn't stop some bulls from already calling for much higher prices by the year-end. In a recent interview on CNBC, Fundstrat Capital CIO Thomas Lee said that the demand versus supply imbalance for BTC meant that its price could easily reach anywhere from $150,000 to $250,000 by the end of this year. As of 4:11 p.m. UTC, bitcoin is trading at around $118,882, having risen 1.38% in the past 24 hours.

XLM's performance, although highly impressive, was not a huge shock since on Saturday, it surged 6% to $0.3880, outperforming the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap. As for HBAR, its intraday high of $0.2516 was reached at 3:10 p.m. UTC, but it is currently trading at around $0.2439, up 27% in the past 24 hours, which makes it right now today's top percentage gainer among the top 20 cryptocurrencies.

The pseudonymous analyst also pointed out that a modest 2.5% dip in bitcoin’s market dominance has already fueled strong rallies across many altcoins. He noted that if such a small decline can trigger outsized altcoin moves, a more substantial drop in dominance — into double-digit territory —could significantly accelerate capital rotation into the altcoin market.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/13/bitcoin-breaks-usd119k-but-xlm-and-hbar-aren-t-impressed-by-its-meager-percentage-gain,"BTC|TRADING|XLM|ALTCOIN|HBAR","Markets|Bitcoin|btc|XLM|hbar|News",cryptocompare

Currently, BTC is testing a cluster of upper trendlines, signaling strong resistance overhead. A breakout above the $120,000 level could open the door to further gains, targeting the $135,000 and $140,000 range, which aligns with the next set of power law bands. Conversely, a rejection at this level could lead to a short-term pullback to the $114,000 and $115,000 zone, which aligns with mid-range support.

As per the update from the Memorandum of Understanding MoU, Animoca will allocate $100 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC) to DDC for management. Strategic Expansion of Bitcoin Treasury Adoption Notably, DDC will manage Animoca’s Bitcoin holding while generating yield from its reserves. The development is a significant event in institutional adoption and Bitcoin treasury management. It adds to the growing trend of traditional companies embracing Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and a preferred store of value. Interestingly, in May, DDC signaled it was embracing the Bitcoin treasury route with plans to accumulate 5,000 BTC over the next three years. After the announcement, DDC made an initial 21 BTC purchase as it began its quest to protect its assets amid global financial uncertainty. Under the management deal with Animoca, Yat Siu, the co-founder and Executive Chairman, will join DCC’s Bitcoin Visionary Council. Siu will be there to provide both leadership and steer the Bitcoin treasury operations. The goal is to ensure that the budding firm aligns with standards obtainable in the sector. Crypto Finance Meets Traditional Industries Speaking on the development, Norma Chu, founder and CEO of DCC, maintained that Siu’s addition to the team at Bitcoin Visionary Council was invaluable. She stated that Siu’s excellent experience will ensure strategic decisions on the BTC initiative. Chu emphasized that together, they hope to build a disciplined risk management system that would ensure they maximize Bitcoin’s full potential as a contemporary asset of value. This marks another bold partnership in the crypto sector. In the first quarter of 2025, Animoca Brands also partnered with Standard Chartered Bank, Hong Kong. The move saw the duo launch a Hong Kong dollar-backed stablecoin . Animoca Considers U.S. Public Listing Meanwhile , Animoca Brands is considering a public listing in the U.S . given the shift in regulatory climate after President Donald Trump assumed office for a second term. Siu says the decision to launch an IPO is strategic as there appear to be fewer regulatory obstacles to deal with. The broader crypto community remains keen on seeing how the partnership turns out.

After this historic high, the price has retreated somewhat and is currently trading at $118,979.14. Bitcoin, which has gained 9.22% over the past seven days, has once again attracted investor attention. In the last 24 hours, the cryptocurrency market saw a total of $205.37 million in liquidations. $83.77 million of these liquidations came from long positions and $121.59 million from short positions. The assets that saw the most liquidations were as follows: BTC: $41.13 million ETH: $35.06 million XRP: $15.32 million XLM: $10.69 million Altcoins like PENGU, DOGE, SOL, and HBAR also saw liquidations worth millions of dollars. Related News: Exchange Wars: Binance Founder CZ Accuses Rival Exchange of Sabotage “Bitcoin has historically been highly correlated with tech stocks, and that trend continues,” said Nic Puckrin, crypto analyst and founder of Coin Bureau. Bitcoin, which has risen around 21% since the beginning of 2025, has also been supported by the Trump administration's crypto-friendly policies, including the creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve and the expansion of digital asset holdings. Pepperstone research strategist Dilin Wu stated that the underlying reason for this rally is the ongoing structural inflows from institutional investors. Wu also emphasized that companies continue to accumulate Bitcoin, noting that firms like MicroStrategy (MSTR) and GameStop (GME) are adding BTC to their balance sheets. Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) reportedly filed an application this week requesting approval to launch a “Crypto Blue Chip ETF” with approximately 70% of its portfolio comprised of Bitcoin. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-13T14:59:03,"Best Currency Exchange in Mississauga: Rates & Top Picks","I got ripped off exchanging currency at Toronto Pearson last month. $500 USD turned into $580 CAD. Should've been $640. Never again. So I went on a mission. Visited every currency exchange in Mississauga. Compared exchange rates. Timed the waits. Asked the dumb questions. Here's what I found. The Winner Is Obvious ChicksX destroys the competition. Not even close. They're the only place doing both regular currency exchange AND crypto. Need to exchange money from USD to CAD? Done. Want to throw some into Bitcoin? Also done. Their exchange rate? Best I found. Their foreign exchange rates beat banks by 3-5%. But here's the kicker: they're open 8 AM to 10 PM. Every. Single. Day. Quick Currency Exchange Comparison Before I dive into the full list, here's how the top currency exchange services stack up: Feature ChicksX Money Exchange World MONEY MONEY Banks Airport Exchange Rate Best rates Good Good Bad Terrible Hours 8 AM-10 PM daily 10 AM-7 PM (M-F) 10 AM-5 PM (M-SAT) 9 AM-5 PM 24/7 Foreign Currencies Available 200+ 50+ 40+ 20+ Limited Crypto Exchange Yes No No No No Wait Time 5-10 min 10-15 min 15-20 min 30-45 min 5 min Online Currency Options Yes Limited No Yes No Money Transfers Yes Yes (Western Union) Yes Yes No Large Transaction Support Yes Yes Yes Sometimes No Best Currency Exchange Services in Mississauga 1. ChicksX - The Clear Winner Location: 2275 Britannia Rd W Unit # 3, Mississauga, ON L5M 2G6, Canada ChicksX is the best currency exchange in Mississauga and it's not even a debate. Why? They give you the mid-market exchange rate minus a tiny fee. Banks? They hide their profit in terrible rates. I exchanged $1,000 USD here. Got $1,340 CAD. Bank of Montreal offered me $1,295. That's $45 saved. Plus they handle foreign currencies nobody else touches. Malaysian Ringgit? Yep. Random crypto? Also yep. Their currency exchange service works both ways too. Need to convert CAD back to USD before heading to the states? They'll buy it back at decent rates. 2. Money Exchange World Location: 700 Burnhamthorpe Rd W #4 Solid for regular currency exchange Mississauga needs. They do money transfers through Western Union if you need to send money abroad. Exchange rates are fair. Not amazing. But fair. They handle most major foreign currencies. Euro, pound, yen: the usual suspects. 3. MONEY MONEY Exchange Location: 3355 Hurontario St #3 These guys specialize in large transactions. International students use them for tuition. Business owners for imports. Their foreign exchange rates get better with bigger amounts. Exchange $100? Meh. Exchange $10,000? Now we're talking. 4. Currency Exchange Xpert Location: 4099 Erin Mills Pkwy Perfect 5-star rating but only 16 reviews. Take that how you will. They offer competitive rates but nothing special. Good if you're already in the area. Why Not Banks or Airport Currency Exchange? Airport Exchange (Toronto Pearson) Only if you hate money. Their exchange rate includes a 10-15% markup. That $100 USD? You'll get maybe $120 CAD. Should be $134. Your Local Bank Banks make money on terrible foreign exchange rates. They'll tell you there's no fee. Lie. The fee is hidden in the rate. You're paying 3-5% extra every time. Plus the wait. And the paperwork. And them treating you like you're asking for their firstborn. How Currency Exchange Actually Works It's stupid simple: Check the mid-market rate online Call for a quote on your currency exchange rates Bring ID and cash Get your receipt Walk out with new currency Some places let you order foreign currency online. ChicksX has online currency exchange options. Book ahead, lock in rates. For transfers over $3,000, most places need advance notice. They don't keep $50,000 in Thai Baht lying around. Exchange Rates Change - Here's What Matters The exchange rate for your currency moves every second. But here's what actually matters: Mid-market exchange rate: What banks trade at. Your benchmark. Retail rate: What you get. Should be within 1-2% of mid-market. Airport/hotel rate: 10-15% markup. Avoid. I check rates on my phone before going. Takes 2 seconds. Saves real money. Foreign Currencies Available Most places in Mississauga handle the basics: USD (US dollars) EUR (Euro) GBP (British Pound) CAD (if you're exchanging out) But if you need: Chinese Yuan Filipino Peso Malaysian Ringgit Indian Rupee Call first. Not everyone stocks these. ChicksX has 200+ currencies. Never seen them not have something. Tips From Someone Who's Been Burned Never exchange at hotels. Ever. Their rates are worse than airports. ATMs abroad? Your debit card charges 3-5% plus ATM fees. Adds up fast. Credit cards? They'll say ""pay in your home currency"" at shops. Don't. That's a 4% markup. Pay in local currency. Get the best exchange by comparing 2-3 places. Takes 10 minutes. Saves 3-5%. Travel money? Exchange 70% here, keep 30% for emergencies. Diversify. When You're Visiting Canada Need CAD? Don't wait till you land at Toronto airport. Foreign exchange in Mississauga gives way better deals. Especially if you're staying in the GTA. The best currency exchange rates are always away from tourist spots. Shocking, right? Safety Stuff Nobody Talks About Good currency exchange services give proper receipts. Keep them. They verify ID. That's good. Means they're legit. Your transaction gets recorded. If something goes wrong, there's a paper trail. Money transfers especially, always get confirmation. Email, text, whatever. Bottom Line on Currency Exchange Mississauga Stop getting screwed by banks and airports. Find a real foreign currency exchange. Compare rates. Save money. I use ChicksX because they've got the best rates, longest hours, and handle both regular and crypto exchange. But even using the second-best place beats banks by miles. Your money. Your choice. Just stop throwing it away on garbage exchange rates. And seriously, that airport currency exchange? Only in emergencies. And I mean real emergencies.

The latest price surge came after Strategy’s former CEO hinted about another purchase, while the author of Rich Dad, Poor Dad said he is going to buy more asap. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView The new peak came minutes ago when BTC jumped to the aforementioned level of $119,400 after slipping back down to $117,000 yesterday. Today’s surge seems somewhat unexpected, at least when viewed from a macroeconomic point of view. After all, the US imposed a new set of tariffs against the EU and Mexico yesterday, at a rate of 30%. Similar instances in the past resulted in price declines, not new peaks. However, bitcoin seems immune to Trump’s global policy at the moment. The cryptocurrency added more than $11,000 since Wednesday, when it stood calmly at $108,000. In the following days, the asset broke into uncharted territory on multiple occasions, including the Friday peak of almost $119,000. You can check some of the possible reasons behind this impressive conclusion of the entire week here . Earlier today, Michael Saylor, the co-founder and bitcoin champion of Startegy, hinted that the company had made another purchase recently after failing to announce a new buy last Monday (which is a rare occasion).

JPMorgan Chase has informed fintech companies such as PayPal, Venmo and Coinbase that they will need to begin paying to access their customers’ bank account information, Bloomberg reports . The companies use the information to make it easier for their customers to send, receive and trade money. JPMorgan is reportedly poised to collect hundreds of millions of dollars in fees for the service. A spokesperson for the bank told Bloomberg that JPMorgan has invested a significant amount of resources in creating a secure system that protects consumer data. “We’ve had productive conversations and are working with the entire ecosystem to ensure we’re all making the necessary investments in the infrastructure that keeps our customers safe.” In his annual letter to shareholders, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon touched on the issue, saying that more guardrails needed to be in place if companies were to continue accessing the banks’ client data. “Third parties want full access to banks’ customer data so they can exploit it for their own purposes and profits. Contrary to what you may read, we have no problem with data sharing but only if it is done properly: It must be authorized by the customer – the customer should know exactly what data is shared and when and how it is used; third parties should pay for accessing the banking system and payment rails; third parties should be restricted from using the customers’ data for purposes beyond what the customer authorized, and they should be liable for the risks they create when accessing and using that data. When banks utilize third-party data, they will be, and in most cases already are, subject to these same obligations. Banks provide fantastic services, and it’s time to defend ourselves – in the public realm or in court if need be.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-13T14:22:08,"Czech central bank adds Coinbase to its portfolio","The Czech National Bank (CNB) has arrived on the crypto scene according to its latest U.S. regulatory filing. The central bank of the European nation added a new position in Coinbase during the second quarter of 2025, marking a rare publicly recorded exposure to a crypto-related equity. The move came alongside an increase in the CNB’s existing stake in Palantir. It reflects a growing appetite for high-growth, high-volatility U.S. tech stocks among institutional allocators. Czech central bank adds Coinbase to its portfolio The Czech central bank’s latest investment was disclosed in a Form 13F filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It revealed that it purchased 51,732 shares of Coinbase Global. At the time of the filing, those shares were worth over $18 million. Coinbase has had a strong 2025 so far. Its stock rose more than 40% in the first half of the year, riding a wave of renewed institutional interest in digital assets and increased regulatory clarity in the U.S. that started with the long-awaited approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2024. Coinbase stock chart. Source: Google Finance The central bank’s filing also showed an additional 49,135 shares purchased in Palantir, a software and artificial intelligence company with ties to the U.S. military, bringing its total holdings to 519,950 shares. The CNB’s move appears to be rooted in passive index-tracking strategies rather than speculative intent. Coinbase joined the S&P 500 in May 2025, and Palantir debuted on the index in September 2024. Palantir and Coinbase are market up-and-comers Central banks usually invest in highly liquid, dollar-denominated securities to diversify reserves and maintain returns in line with benchmark indices. In this case, the CNB’s purchase of Coinbase may be less about a bold bet on crypto and more about staying aligned with the U.S. stock market makeup. Spotting Palantir and Coinbase in the CNB’s portfolio adds to the growing institutional appetite for disruptive tech sectors. Palantir has been a favorite among AI-focused investors looking to reap gains from its data analytics and government contracts. Its PLTR stock rose 80% in the first half of 2025, far outpacing the S&P 500’s modest 5.5% return during the same period. Coinbase has maintained a strong institutional profile. Since its addition to the S&P 500, the company has benefited from increased ETF adoption, new exchange-traded products, and a sharp uptick in spot trading volume across Bitcoin and Ethereum markets. The CNB’s timing may prove fortunate, as Coinbase has added roughly 10% more in Q3.
