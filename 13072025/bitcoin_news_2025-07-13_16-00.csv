Wallace claimed that Coinbase was the “anonymous” source behind the negative press about US President Donald Trump’s crypto project World Liberty Financial and Binance. Wallace used the following expressions in his post: “Evidence is emerging that Coinbase is the anonymous source behind President Trump’s smear campaign against World Liberty Financial and Binance.” Related News: Major Bitcoin Bull Michael Saylor Responds to the Question of ‘Whether He Will Sell Bitcoin’ Coinbase executives were allegedly concerned about a potential presidential pardon for CZ and the possibility of Binance returning to the US with legal status. Given Coinbase's high transaction fees and poor customer service, it's believed that Binance could lose significant market share if it re-enters the US market. “Binance is the world's No. 1 crypto exchange. Returning to the US with legal status would immediately shrink Coinbase's market share and severely damage its revenue. Most shockingly, Coinbase is targeting President Trump to undermine its own competition. This is un-American,” Wallace said. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-13T13:30:21,"Bitcoin Price Outlook for 2025: $250,000 Possible While Ozak AI Remains the Talk of Presale Markets","Optimism is rising within the crypto market—particularly in terms of the two ends of the spectrum: Bitcoin, the project blue-chip asset, and Ozak AI , a rising presale-level token generating extreme buzz. While Bitcoin bulls eye a potential surge to $250,000 subsidized by means of growing institutional adoption and international macro traits, Ozak AI keeps to benefit traction as one of the maximum discussed early-stage altcoins with its integration of artificial intelligence and decentralized records infrastructure. Bitcoin Targeting a $250K Breakout Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading above $117,000 and stays the undisputed leader of the crypto market. With the following bull cycle underway and broader popularity of BTC as a digital store of value, many analysts believe a target of $250,000 in 2025 is within reach. Factors just like the current Bitcoin ETF approvals, growing company holdings, and growing interest from institutional buyers have drastically boosted demand. The key to Bitcoin’s boom lies in its growing legitimacy amongst traditional finance players. Major asset managers now maintain exposure to BTC, and a few governments are even exploring Bitcoin-based total funding strategies. While it is able to no longer supply the equal exponential gains as smaller-cap altcoins, Bitcoin gives a level of security and predictability that many buyers nonetheless find attractive—particularly those with large portfolios searching for hedge-like belongings at some stage in financial uncertainty. Ozak AI: The $0.005 Token Targeting $1 While Bitcoin sets its sights on a potential 2x to 3x return, Ozak AI is capturing attention with its far more ambitious projection: a 200x move from its current presale price of $0.005 to $1. What sets Ozak AI apart from many other presale tokens is its real-world use case. Built around predictive AI, decentralized data vaults, and scalable infrastructure, Ozak AI is creating a platform for advanced data analytics tailored to financial markets. Its ecosystem includes the Ozak Stream Network (OSN) for real-time data flow, Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) for secure processing, and highly customizable AI agents that users can train to fit specific data analysis needs. As more institutions and traders look for competitive AI tools to enhance their decision-making, Ozak AI aims to fill that gap, offering a utility that could generate sustainable demand over time. The project has already raised over $1.3 million and is currently in Stage 4 of its presale, with growing community support and early listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. With such a low entry point, even modest adoption could push Ozak AI toward its $1 target in the coming cycle. Bitcoin and Ozak AI represent two very different investment strategies going into 2025. Bitcoin may appeal to those looking for a relatively safer store of value with a high ceiling, while Ozak AI is designed for high-risk, high-reward investors betting on disruptive innovation in the AI and crypto space. If Bitcoin does reach $250,000, it will solidify its status as a long-term global asset. But if Ozak AI hits $1, it could become one of the most legendary ROI stories of this bull run. About Ozak AI Ozak AI is a blockchain-based crypto task that provides an innovative platform that focuses on predictive AI and advanced data analytics for financial markets. Through machine learning algorithms and decentralized community technologies, Ozak AI enables real-time, accurate, and actionable insights to help crypto lovers and corporations make the perfect choices.

2025-07-13T13:24:23,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Steady Around $118,000 As Rally Takes A Breather","Bitcoin (BTC) looks to be taking a bit of a breather as its rally paused over the weekend. The flagship cryptocurrency’s unprecedented rally sent it to record levels, with the price peaking at $118,856 on Friday. BTC raced to a new all-time high on Friday and is marginally up over the past 24 hours, trading around $117,903. The price had dipped to a low of $117,101 early on Monday before recovering and moving to current levels. Bitcoin (BTC) Investors Look Ahead To Crucial Week Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto investors head into the week betting on a slew of crucial wins for the industry that could bring new investment and capital into the asset class. The US House of Representatives is set to debate several crypto bills that could provide the crypto industry with the regulatory framework it has demanded. President Trump has promised to support the crypto industry and urged lawmakers to draft favorable policies and rules for the sector. The President himself is involved in several crypto ventures, including World Liberty Financial, run by his sons Eric and Don Jr. Congress will vote on the GENIUS Act, the CLARITY Act, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, as the industry’s recently strained ties with Washington continue to thaw. Jag Kooner, head of derivatives at crypto exchange Bitfinex, stated, “Even if final passage stalls, the optics of legislative engagement are bullish.” Bitcoin’s rally triggered a broader uptick in the market, with several altcoins crossing key levels. Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, stated, “Investors are racing to take positions ahead of the extra publicity this event could attract.” Robert Kiyosaki Planning Another Bitcoin Buy Robert Kiyosaki, author of the best-selling Rich Dad Poor Dad, has reiterated one of his classic lessons about investor behavior and market timing, especially in terms of Bitcoin . Kiyosaki took to X to discuss investor psychology, stating, “Pigs get fat. Hogs get slaughtered. I state this lesson because I bought my latest bitcoin at $110K.” The best-selling author noted he was entering what investors call the “Banana Zone,” an explosive phase of upward price action driven by retail frenzy. The author contrasted the two types of market participants, stating, “Being a fat pig with enough bitcoin… I will wait for the coming hog slaughter. After the hogs stop squealing and selling and blaming bitcoin for their losses, my fellow pigs and I will buy more bitcoin on sale.” Kiyosaki is well-known for emphasizing long-term thinking and smart entry points when it comes to investing. The latest post emphasizes his philosophy that true gains come from patient and informed investing decisions. Retail Traders Missing Bitcoin (BTC) hit consecutive highs this week. However, retail investors are visibly absent, hesitant to jump back into the market. Despite this, demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs is surging, with Thursday and Friday recording inflows of over $1 billion, indicating that the rally is being driven by institutional investors. Bitwise head of research Andre Dragosch stated, “Bitcoin is at new all-time highs, but retail is almost nowhere to be found. Latest leg up is mostly driven by institutions.” Some market watchers speculate that retail investors believe they may have missed the boat and perceive the current price as too high to enter the market. Bitcoin commentator Lindsay Stamp stated, “I think a lot of retail folks find out the price of one Bitcoin is 117k and think, nahhh I missed the boat, and don’t even give it a second thought.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin’s (BTC) unprecedented rally has taken a breather over the weekend, as the price consolidates between $117,000 and $118,000. The flagship cryptocurrency set consecutive records this week, racing to a high of $116,393 on Thursday and $118,856 on Friday. The rally is part of a broader trend of investors embracing risk assets thanks to growing institutional interest and acceptance of digital assets like Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Inflows and market trends pushed BTC past $118,000, with over $1.4 billion in short positions liquidated. Major industry figures have predicted further upside, stability, and more institutional buying as Bitcoin treasury companies snap up the asset. Analysts expect bullish momentum to continue, with BTC continuing to push higher. Favorable macroeconomic developments next week could drive the price beyond $120,000. BTC registered a substantial increase on Wednesday (July 2), rising nearly 3% to $108,845. The price continued pushing higher on Thursday, reaching an intraday high of $110,583 before settling at $109,637. However, it was back in the red on Friday, dropping 1.41% to $108,097. BTC recovered over the weekend, registering a marginal increase on Saturday and then rising almost 1% on Sunday to settle at $109,231. Despite the positive weekend, BTC was back in the red on Monday, dropping nearly 1% to $108,273. Source: TradingView The price recovered on Tuesday, rising almost 1% to $108,942.

2025-07-13T13:15:00,"Bitcoin: Lightning Strikes Twice (Technical Analysis) (Rating Upgrade)","Summary Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, touching $119K as of July 11th, 2025. Congrats, Bitcoin! This milestone highlights Bitcoin's continued strength alongside the broader stock market rally. However, stocks were flat while BTC rallied 8% this week. I break down the 1 year and 1 month charts for BTC, including trends, support and resistance levels, and momentum and strength indicators. There are bearish signals in one chart and bullish signals in the other, confirming a pattern I am seeing form across high-beta and risk-on assets. I consider it very bullish. Consider not only if and at what price one should enter the trade, but also how — we have many tools available to use now in how to hold BTC. I discuss several options (including options). Introduction We are once again at a new historic moment for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). Alongside the stock market, BTC is reaching new highs, breaking $119,000 on July 11th, 2025, even if for just a moment. This marks Bitcoin's new all-time high, and rounds out a 25% gain YTD for BTC, and an even larger change from the bottom Bitcoin found in April. Data by YCharts This comes after a killer near 8% week, and a rally in Bitcoin that came on the heels of the passage of the Big Beautiful Bill from the week prior. Interestingly enough, this breakout from Bitcoin didn't follow US markets, which were flat over the same time. Actually, Bitcoin has been decoupling a lot lately, though it was still very correlated in the crash back in April. It has its moments. Data by YCharts The decoupling of Bitcoin from markets is a great sign, as it frees up Bitcoin to keep moving in its own direction in the coming weeks. Even if markets stay flat, or even fall, could Bitcoin keep this momentum up? Let's see what the charts say. Bitcoin Technical Analysis First, it should be of note that I've been seeing the same pattern in many charts lately , due to the correlation between high-beta assets. While Bitcoin can decouple from time to time, it overall has kept up with beta overall this past year. So I won't be talking about the inverse head and shoulders pattern I see, but you can read about that in the article linked above. I see it more in the Nasdaq 100 chart than I do here, anyway. Bitcoin didn't get the same volume boost at the breakout, but it did get the breakout. That's what brought us here, to our new all-time high. BTC One-Year Chart Here's the one-year chart I'm looking at, legend at the top of the image: Barchart There are a few things that stand out to me here: Trend since April low has been clearly upwards. Confirmed by higher highs and higher lows. Here is April-July in daily candles. Barchart We saw our first breakout in November, following the election hype. 200 EMA (maroon line) mostly held during March and April lows, indicating strong structural support around that level. Mid-June showed us the breakout cleanly above the psychological $100K barrier. Momentum gauges like RSI, MACD, and PPO are all bullish currently, showing some of the strongest momentum since Q4 2024. Barchart Here are the current support levels we can chart out: Level Type Note $119,000 Resistance Psychological, ATH $116,000 Support Last resistance $109,700 Support 20 EMA $105,500 Support 50 EMA $100,300 Strong Support 100 EMA $92,200 Strong Support 200 EMA This is a classic breakout happening, which is bullish, especially when confirmed with strong momentum and not-overbought conditions on the RSI (yet), MACD, and PPO. That being said, we could still see some short-term pullbacks, but I expected these levels to hold barring a large market correction that could bring down Bitcoin in sympathy. Otherwise, the chart says we may have $116,000, the last technical resistance that we broke out of to hit these new highs, as a new support level for midday trading noise. Traders looking to enter Bitcoin may consider looking around these various support levels, especially if we drop to the 100 EMA, around the $100K mark. That would be a psychological battle for price that could determine bullish or bearish sentiment moving forward. However, I don't expect us to test those levels soon, and certainly not without a negative catalyst. BTC One-Month Chart Looking back just at the past month shows us a different story, one that is far more exhausted than the one-year looks. This is where that ""short term pullback"" could come from. Barchart This is a consolidation pattern, which is common following a breakout, especially with a movement as forceful and strong as this last one was. See how fast the MACD and PPO lines jumped on July 10th-11th. That's one of the ways we can see the strength of a rally, although these indicators can tend to lag at times. Most of the movement that caused them to jump started on July 9th. Zoom in on the most recent ticks; remember that these are hour candles on a one-month chart. Note how we fell firmly below the 20 EMA, which is now acting as a resistance level. Next support is at the 50 EMA, which is down at $116,300. Barchart We could easily fall to $112,000 before resuming the upward trend, but it will depend on volume. Current volume hasn't changed much since the breakout, and if anything is a bit lower since then. Momentum indicators are bearish, and the RSI is reflecting close-to oversold conditions, but still has room to fall if consolidation continues. Barchart The positives about this chart is that it is showing us a very small bull flag around the consolidation, and this may be a textbook case of ""refueling,"" or buyer demand falling off after a breakout. That is usually a bullish signal to buy now, though I am hesitant to ever recommend buying anything at all-time highs. Bitcoin Investment Strategy For those holding BTC outright or through ETFs like IBIT, I would suggest continuing to hold. This may be a great opportunity, but I don't know if I add here. Personally, I am not adding to my position in Bitcoin because I am happy with my current allocation. This take doesn't mean I'm not bullish, and so I am still giving Bitcoin a buy rating here, but I just happened to have already bought (long) before I wrote this piece. I am right-sized currently, and suggest others consider their risk tolerance carefully, as Bitcoin is incredibly volatile. For those looking to buy in now, entry point matters. I would look for a pullback to the $110k-105k region, testing the 20 EMA and the 50 EMA. This may come on the back of the short-term weakness I see in the one-month chart, and I expect us to see increased intraday volatility as we test new highs. Those trading days will likely provide some solid entry points. For options traders, this breakout is likely to come with volatility, and we're already seeing IV push up. Long calls are risky due to currently high IV, as a prolonged pullback from here could deflate IV and crush options pricing. Short puts far OTM, with strikes below 100 EMA (~$100k or equivalent in ETF pricing) may be attractive, but cap upside participation if the breakout is sustained as I expect. For example, here is the IBIT Dec 31st 65C (a way cheaper way to buy options on Bitcoin). Notice the elevated implied volatility (purple line) relative to the inflated price, which we should expect either way since the underlying asset has run up to all-time highs. If IV falls back to where it was even just a few days ago, the call could rapidly lose value even if the asset stays at its current level. This phenomenon would be advantageous for options sellers, which is why I would recommend OTM short puts instead of long calls. OptionStrat How I Own BTC Personally, I don't own any actual Bitcoins anymore, as I got rid of most of the collection I had over the 2021 cycle when I felt like the bubble behavior had gotten too bad (NFTs, etc.), and the rest has become dust sitting across various wallets. It's no longer worth it to collect that, at least for now. I don't include that meaningfully in my Bitcoin allocation. Since the rise of access to derivatives and commodity-based ETFs over the last few years has changed the way people access BTC, I no longer feel the need to store them physically or with a custodian like Coinbase ( COIN ). I own them through my brokerage account now. I own Bitcoin two ways: The iShares IBIT ETF The Simplify MAXI ETF Income investors should also check out Roundhill's YBTC and NEOS' BTCI ; they're both great covered call funds covering BTC. Conclusion Ultimately, I see the possibility for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) to continue to impress, even after hitting a new all-time high on Friday. Risk-on assets are in vogue, and high beta instruments like Bitcoin are riding a generally positive wave. However, Bitcoin decoupled from stocks, which were flat last week, to run up almost 8% and set a new record. Technical analysis shows us a positive setup for Bitcoin, with the one-year chart looking far more bullish than the one-month chart. This falls in line with the general trend and pattern I am seeing, where BTC is consolidating after its breakout this past week. Consolidations may test new technical support levels, offering attractive entry points for bullish investors. I see the potential for more pain ahead, especially if stocks and other high-beta assets consolidate in the coming days, down to $110,000. However, there are several smaller barriers before then, and trading may be choppy through the summer. Long-term bullishness and short-term bearishness historically benefits buyers. Look out for opportunities, and be patient if necessary. Remember that position sizing is often more important than security selection.

2025-07-13T12:45:56,"Bank Insider Allegedly Obtains Customers’ Debit Card PINs, Drains $440,000 From Their Accounts in Just Two Months: DOJ","An associate banker at a large national bank is accused of stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars from customers in a span of just two months. According to the Northern District of California’s U.S. Attorney’s Office, Sixto Christopher Porras allegedly stole approximately $440,000 from two retail bank customers while stationed in San Francisco. In each of the cases, Porras managed to drain the bank accounts using the customer’s existing debit cards or replacements. The first incident occurred in August of 2023 after a customer walked into the bank to conduct a wire transfer, according to the Northern District of California’s U.S. Attorney’s Office. “As the transfer was processed, Porras obtained from the customer the security personal identification number associated with the customer’s debit card. Unbeknownst to the customer, Porras kept the customer’s debit card. Porras allegedly proceeded to use the debit card to embezzle approximately $100,000 from the customer’s account.” The second incident took place about a month later. “In or about September 2023, another retail bank customer visited the branch to address a fraudulent charge. As Porras assisted the customer, he obtained the security PIN associated with the customer’s debit card. Porras then caused the customer’s debit card to be reissued and sent to Porras’ San Francisco residence. Porras allegedly proceeded to use the debit card to embezzle approximately $340,000 from the customer’s accounts.” Porras, who currently no longer works with the unnamed bank, is now facing charges of embezzlement of bank funds and access device fraud. For the embezzlement charge, Porras could get a maximum of up to 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine if convicted. The access device fraud charge carries a maximum of 15 years in prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted.

2025-07-13T12:30:51,"Ethereum ETFs Register $907 Million Inflows, Set New Weekly Record – Details","The US spot Ethereum ETFs have logged another bullish week, attracting over $900 million in inflows and extending their winning streak to nine consecutive weeks. This development comes amidst the general crypto price rally during which Ethereum (ETH) prices surged to over $2,800. Ethereum ETFs Hit Highest Weekly Netflows In the past week, Ethereum registered a remarkable weekly gain of 16.22%. During this period, data from the ETF tracking site SoSoValue shows the Ethereum ETFs registered net deposits of $907.99 million, representing their largest weekly inflows since their launch in July 2024. Before this development, the highest inflows stood at $854.85 registered in the second week of December 2024 amidst the popular crypto bull run. Of the ATH weekly inflows, BlackRock’s ETHA attracted a resounding $675 million, reflecting an unrivalled market dominance similar to its Bitcoin counterpart. ETHA now boasts $6.14 billion in assets under management, representing 45.38% of the total net assets of spot Ethereum ETFs. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s FETH and Grayscale’s duo – ETH and ETHE, also recorded significant net deposits valued at $87.04 million, $73.53 million, and $36.64 million, respectively. On the other hand, Bitwise’s ETHW, VanEck’s ETHV, 21 Shares’ CEZT, and Franklin Templeton’s EZET all saw modest inflows ranging between $5 million – $16 million. However, Invesco’s QETH saw another week of negative netflows as this particular continues to suffer an epileptic performance. Following this week, the cumulative inflows of spot Ethereum ETFs now stand at $5.13 billion, despite ETHA’s singular inflows of $6.47 billion due to significant withdrawals valued at $4.26 billion from the Grayscale ETHA. In addition, the total net assets of these ETFs are now valued $13.53 billion, representing a 24.93% increase from the previous week. Interestingly, these figures indicate that the spot Ethereum ETFs now account for 3.77% of the total Ethereum market cap. Meanwhile, Ethereum continues to trade at $2,964 following a 0.11% decline in the past day. Altcoins ETF Race Underway In other news, other prominent altcoins aside from Ethereum are likely to soon debut in the US Spot ETF market. Notably, asset managers have submitted a host of altcoin-affiliated ETF applications to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), looking to replicate the success of the Ethereum and Bitcoin ETFs, in attracting a weighty institutional interest to the crypto market. Presently, there are over 70 crypto ETF filings looking to grant investors access to Solana , Dogecoin, XRP, Cardano , Litecoin, among other cryptocurrencies. It is likely the SEC will keep issuing a delay on its responses till the final deadline, most of which comes around October.

2025-07-13T12:30:00,"LATAM crypto news: El Salvador doubles down on Bitcoin as Argentina leads lithium tokenization","Latin America’s crypto scene continues to evolve, with new products and regional expansions highlighting its rapid growth. This week’s most notable news is that Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, trading above $116,000, which has pushed El Salvador’s holdings to over $722 million, peaking at $726 million at one point. Argentina, on the other hand, continues to move forward with its plans to tokenise assets such as lithium reserves in San Juan, using the Cardano blockchain. El Salvador doubles down on Bitcoin amid new all-time high Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, trading above $116,000, which has pushed El Salvador’s holdings to over $722 million, peaking at $726 million at one point. Despite strong criticism from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which has urged the country to reduce its BTC purchases in exchange for a $1.4 billion loan agreement, El Salvador continues to expand its Bitcoin portfolio. Holding 6,234 BTC, the government sees the cryptocurrency as more than an investment—it’s a tool for financial inclusion and independence from traditional banking systems. Since making Bitcoin legal tender in 2021, El Salvador has adopted the cryptocurrency to reduce remittance costs, increase economic autonomy, and protect its citizens from inflation. While the policy remains contentious, particularly among institutions such as the IMF, the Bukele administration is steadfast in its confidence that Bitcoin will drive the country’s economic destiny. As Bitcoin’s bullish trend continues, El Salvador’s holdings may climb higher, cementing the country’s pioneering role in global cryptocurrency adoption. Argentina leads lithium tokenisation with blockchain innovation In a ground-breaking move, Paraguayan firm Atómico3 and Taiwan’s Hua Lian Mining have collaborated to tokenise lithium reserves in San Juan, Argentina, via the Cardano blockchain. This endeavour represents a significant step toward combining traditional mining and blockchain technology, allowing lithium assets to be represented as digital currencies. These coins will be available to both institutional and retail investors, enhancing transparency, traceability, and access to funding for renewable energy projects. Argentina has established itself as a mining-tech pioneer in Latin America by converting physical lithium reserves into digital assets. The tokenisation process comprises reserve certification, smart contract implementation, and blockchain connectivity to provide security and transparency. This strategy not only permits global investment but also promotes sustainability and decentralised governance, paving the way for other lithium-rich countries such as Chile, Peru, and Bolivia. USDC expands B2B reach with new partnerships in Brazil Circle, the firm behind the USDC stablecoin, has announced a cooperation with HiFi Bridge to facilitate cross-border B2B transfers between the United States, Brazil, and Hong Kong. HiFi, an API platform meant to ease company payments, has been integrated into the Circle Payments Network. This move follows a similar attempt in June when Coinbase collaborated with Brazilian fintech Matera to offer USDC transactions via PIX, signalling the early adoption of digital payments in the region. In 2024, the worldwide B2B payments sector generated more than $905 billion, with the United States contributing $160 billion to Latin America. Brazil alone got $330 million in remittances in May 2025. Visa has also joined the field with Kob Visa, reporting 30x transaction growth and an estimated $85 trillion B2B market. Meanwhile, Drex, Brazil’s digital currency experiment, shows promise in real estate tokenisation, with authorities praising its ability to improve efficiency and transparency.

In a new interview with CNBC Television, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan says that blue-chip institutions having increasing demand for BTC mixed with its limited supply could push the value of Bitcoin by about 70% from current prices. “There’s unrelenting demand from corporations and institutional investors, and that’s colliding with severely limited supply. You know the Bitcoin network only produces 450 Bitcoin per day. Yesterday alone, Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) bought 10,000 Bitcoin. This institutional investment into Bitcoin is a one-time event. It’s going to take years to play out. But I think over the course of those years, there’s going to be this persistent bid where there’s more demand than there is supply. And the natural response to that is what we’re seeing in the market, which is Bitcoin’s price goes higher. I think it has a long way to go. I think it could end the year closer to $200,000. So I would get used to this story of new all-time highs.” Hougan adds that interest in Bitcoin’s use cases is growing, particularly amid rising geopolitical uncertainty. “Bitcoin provides a service which is the ability to store wealth in a digital format without relying on a bank. The vibes are definitely part of it. Vibes influence stocks. They influence bonds, but the underlying driver for the rise is more people want this service that Bitcoin provides. In this uncertain world, where there are tariffs and geopolitical tensions, people want to be able to own their wealth in a digital format.” Bitcoin is trading for $117,470 at time of writing, a marginal decrease on the day.

2025-07-13T11:45:00,"Animoca Brands Partners with DayDayCook to Manage $100M Bitcoin Treasury","Web3 powerhouse Animoca Brands has entered a strategic partnership with DayDayCook (DDC) Enterprise, a packaged food and meal-prep company, to oversee Animoca’s Bitcoin holdings and generate yield from its reserves. Key Takeaways: Animoca Brands partners with DayDayCook to manage up to $100 million in Bitcoin reserves. Companies increasingly use Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and a long-term store of value. Institutional Bitcoin holdings surged in Q2 2025. The agreement, a non-binding memorandum of understanding (MOU) announced Thursday , marks a significant step in the growing trend of corporate Bitcoin treasury management. Under the deal, Animoca plans to allocate up to $100 million worth of Bitcoin to DDC for management. Animoca Brands Partnership Comes as Bitcoin Gains Ground as Treasury The partnership reflects an emerging wave of companies integrating Bitcoin into their treasury strategies as a hedge against inflation and a long-term store of value. DayDayCook first revealed its Bitcoin treasury ambitions in May, announcing a target purchase of 5,000 BTC over three years. The company made an initial move by acquiring 21 BTC for its corporate treasury in the same month. This aligns with a broader corporate shift toward Bitcoin adoption, as firms seek to diversify and protect their assets amid economic uncertainty. While the rise of Bitcoin treasury companies signals growing mainstream acceptance, it has also sparked debate among investors. Some see these entities as critical drivers for wider adoption, while others warn of the risks posed by overleveraged firms that could exacerbate market downturns. Food group DDC Enterprise ($DDC) is partnering with #Web3 firm Animoca Brands to boost its new #Bitcoin treasury strategy! Animoca will commit up to $100M in $BTC , and co-founder Yat Siu will join DDC's Bitcoin council. DDC already holds 368 BTC, up 48.3% since mid-June pic.twitter.com/xoUJsNuymy — Crypto Rose Channel (@rosycutee2) July 13, 2025 Data from BitcoinTreasuries shows 268 institutions currently hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets, spanning public companies, private firms, government bodies, asset managers, and crypto-focused enterprises. Public companies make up the largest segment, accounting for 147 of these holders. The second quarter of 2025 saw these treasury companies add 159,107 BTC, valued at over $18.7 billion, marking a 23% increase in acquisitions from the previous quarter. Blockstream CEO Adam Back described this trend as a “new altseason ,” urging traders to shift investments into Bitcoin or Bitcoin treasuries. Analysts Warn of Risks Ahead for Bitcoin Treasury Companies However, despite the enthusiasm, caution persists. Analysts warn many treasury companies may falter when Bitcoin prices fall or when access to affordable corporate financing tightens, potentially leading to significant market corrections. Last week, Glassnode lead analyst James Check raised concerns over the longevity of the corporate Bitcoin treasury strategy, arguing the easy gains might already be gone for new entrants as the market matures. The warning echoes recent comments from Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, who has voiced concerns over the Bitcoin treasury strategies adopted by some publicly traded firms. Sigel singled out the use of at-the-market (ATM) share issuance programs, arguing that these can become dilutive if a company’s stock price nears its Bitcoin net asset value (NAV). Meanwhile, New York law firm Pomerantz LLP has filed a class action lawsuit against Michael Saylor’s Strategy, accusing the Bitcoin-focused firm of misleading investors about the profitability and risks of its crypto investment strategy.

2025-07-13T11:36:07,"‘We’ll see a monster move’ in altcoins next week, says expert","Economist Henrik Zeberg has predicted a surge across altcoins in the coming week, citing technical patterns that point to a bullish momentum. It’s worth noting that the cryptocurrency market has been anticipating an altcoin season following sustained Bitcoin ( BTC ) dominance, which culminated in the maiden digital currency trading at a high of $118,000. Zeberg based his projection on the development of “wave III of wave 3 of wave C” in most altcoins, he said in an X post on July 12. I think we will see a monster move in wide range of Alts this coming week. We got wave iii of wave 3 of wave C developing in various Alts. Let's see how this tweet will age 😉 — Henrik Zeberg (@HenrikZeberg) July 12, 2025 The waves reference Elliott Wave Theory, which traders use to analyze market psychology and price trends. In this framework, Wave 3 is typically the strongest, with Wave iii representing an especially powerful sub-phase of acceleration. Ethereum to lead altcoin rally He also noted that Ethereum ( ETH ) is already showing the expected breakout and is likely to lead the broader altcoin rally. This behavior is typical of altcoin seasons, when capital rotates out of Bitcoin into smaller cryptocurrencies, amplifying gains across the market. To this end, the expert expects Ethereum to rise further before a summer lull, a period when crypto trading often slows. However, he warned that the rally could be followed by a sharp pullback later in the season, suggesting traders should prepare for significant volatility. At press time, the second-ranked cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading at $2,955, down 0.6% in the last 24 hours. In the past week, ETH has rallied 17%. Meanwhile, cryptocurrency trading expert Michaël van de Poppe observed in a July 12 X post that Bitcoin dominance is weakening, with a clear bearish divergence emerging. Historically, such patterns have signaled short-term reversals and triggered rallies in altcoins. Altcoin market analysis chart. Source: TradingView Key support around 54% to 55% is now in focus, and a confirmed drop below this level could drive a rotation into altcoins over the next one to two weeks, as traders seek higher returns outside of Bitcoin. Altcoin market cap flashing bullish signals Additionally, pseudonymous analyst El_crypto_prof, in an X post on July 13, highlighted growing altcoin optimism, noting that the TOTAL3 index (which tracks the altcoin market cap excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum) is flashing a bullish signal. In this case, the weekly MACD has made a bullish cross, a move that has historically marked the start of strong altcoin rallies. Altcoin market analysis chart. Source: TradingView His analysis indicates that the market is breaking out of a descending broadening wedge, a bullish pattern. A similar breakout in November 2024 led to a powerful altcoin rally, and the current setup in July 2025 appears to mirror that move.

2025-07-13T11:30:22,"Complacent markets get a jolt with Trump’s latest 30% tariff threats","Contrary to investor expectations, Trump announced a 30% tariff rate on the European Union and Mexico, set to take effect on August 1. Markets had started growing complacent to Trump’s threats, but his latest revelations could change that. Trump insists he will implement more levies on Japan, South Korea, Canada, Brazil, Algeria, and other trading partners, calling on them to negotiate deals. Trump warns that any retaliation will lead to higher levies Bankers and executives, including JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, cautioned against the growing market complacency. However, investors remained adamant, believing the US president would back down on the levies as he had done previously. Meanwhile, Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management, has told investors not to count on Trump dropping his 30% tariff threat on the EU. He called the tariffs “punitive” but claimed they would harm the EU more than the US, hinting that Trump may not necessarily stop them . So far, Mexico’s government has called the levies unfair and stressed its independence and sovereignty as a country. On the other hand, the EU Commission’s chief, Ursula von der Leyen, responded with a warning of reciprocal action . Despite the mounting tensions, both remain open to further negotiations with Washington. In a letter addressed Friday to the European Commission President, he detailed that despite years of dialogue, the US-EU trade relationship remains unbalanced, defined by persistent deficits. While addressing Mexico, President Trump acknowledged their cooperation on border security but remarked, “Mexico has been helping me secure the border. BUT, what Mexico has done is not enough,” hence the 30% tariffs. In both correspondences, however, he clarified that retaliatory actions would prompt the US to raise tariffs even further. Meanwhile, speaking in a Fox News segment that aired on Saturday, the US President noted that several countries were enraged with his decision, but defended the tariffs, claiming they were bringing vast sums of revenue into the country. The EU has been a target for Trump’s tariffs since April. He initially proposed a 20% levy on goods from the bloc and other trade partners, before later threatening to increase it to 50% as negotiations broke down. Investors react differently compared to when Trump announced his April tariffs Major cryptocurrencies have fallen slightly since Trump’s tariff announcement. Bitcoin , the top crypto asset by market capitalization, slipped 0.6% from its European session peak of $118,200. Ether (ETH) also declined, trading 1% lower on the day at $2,930 (UTC), while Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE) dropped over 2%. Moreover, the BNB token fell 0.7%. Only XRP gained close to 2% among leading crypto assets after the announcement. Despite the crypto losses, Wall Street investors are proving hard to scare. In Trump’s tariff notices to his trading allies, he reportedly left room for adjustments that could reduce the rates, and urged his allies to negotiate for better deals. According to Jacobsen, this has calmed some of the investors’ concerns about the tariff situation. He commented, “As usual, there are many conditions and clauses that can get these rates reduced. That’s probably why the market might not like the tariff talk, but it’s not panicking about it either.” When Trump announced the first batch of reciprocal tariffs in April, the market reacted frantically by selling some of their assets and US treasuries. However, with this round of tariffs, they seem more relaxed, as the president paused all his earlier levies, and they strongly believe he will do the same this time round. Trump’s setting of the deadline for negotiation on August 1 has not even deterred the markets. However, stocks dwindled marginally on Friday when Trump increased his trade offensive.

2025-07-13T11:23:35,"CONL Displays Substantial Exposure To Bitcoin","Summary CONL offers 2x daily leveraged exposure to Coinbase via swaps, amplifying both gains and losses for active traders. CONL may provide traders with exceptional exposure to bitcoin due to Coinbase's brokerage and lending operations. The ETF is highly liquid with over $1 billion AUM and robust trading volume, creating a viable vehicle for active traders. Given strong historical performance and minimal value decay, I rate CONL a BUY for traders seeking aggressive, short-term COIN exposure. The GraniteShares 2x Long COIN Daily ETF ( CONL ) is a leveraged trading strategy designed to provide traders with 2x the daily performance of Coinbase Global ( COIN ). COIN share performance is relatively correlated to the performance of bitcoin, given the significant exposure to bitcoin transactions Coinbase inherently holds. TradingView In short, Coinbase offers a variety of financial services as a cryptocurrency brokerage platform, including bitcoin collateralized loans. These features may create a certain leveraged-like revenue stream for Coinbase, resulting in substantial relative performance to bitcoin over a long holding period. TradingView CONL does not directly invest in COIN shares, but rather, provides exposure entirely through the use of swap contracts. As a swap payer , CONL receives the daily performance of COIN while paying a fixed rate, providing leveraged exposure to the underlying stock. CONL holds a 200% position by weight in COIN swaps. Because of the daily settlement of the swap options, CONL performance will reflect that of the swaps and reset daily, resulting in the 2x target performance only being applicable to daily performance. Longer holding periods may result in a compounding effect for CONL investors, potentially resulting in excess gains or losses to the performance of COIN shares. Comparing the 1-month performance between CONL and COIN shares, CONL’s performance has exceeded the 2x daily target, exhibiting the compounding effect to the upside. TradingView Downside risk can also be amplified during extended holding periods tied to the downside performance of the underlying stock. Investors must remain cautious if seeking to hold CONL for an extended period, as consecutive days of downside risk can result in substantial losses to a position in CONL. TradingView Looking at performance since inception, CONL does not exhibit a substantial level of value decay often realized across the leveraged ETF space. Though past performance shouldn’t be indicative of the future, I believe the market depth and underlying performance of COIN shares have supported relative strength in CONL. TradingView Looking at the ETF components, CONL provides substantial depth for traders to actively manage a position. CONL has $1.02b in assets under management with an average of 7.64mm shares trading hands on a daily basis. This should provide traders with a liquid market for entering and exiting a position, minimizing cost-in/cost-out risk. CONL has a relatively high fee when compared to peer leveraged ETFs of 110bps. It is typical for leveraged strategies to command higher fees and given the market depth, I do not believe a few extra basis points on the fee should be a determining factor for trading this strategy. Seeking Alpha Risks Related to Leveraged Strategies There are inherent risks in investing in leveraged strategies. Because these strategies are meant to achieve their stated multiple over the underlying index on a daily basis, holding these strategies beyond a single day can lead to skewed performance, especially following consecutive days of upside or downside risk. This can lead to a compounding effect as well as value decay as a result of the daily reset in the derivatives positions. Leveraged strategies also add an extra layer of risk to amplified downside potential. For example, if the underlying index were to appreciate by 2% in a single day, a 3x strategy would appreciate by 6%, meaning that an investment of $100 would increase to $106. If the following day results in a -2% decline in the underlying index, or a -6% decline in the leveraged strategy, the investment will decline to $99.64. Holding leveraged strategies for longer than a single day can lead to a compounding effect on one’s position, potentially leading to significant skews from the intended multiplier. During multiple days of downside risk, an investor can experience significant value decay, potentially resulting in the inability to recover losses. Liquidity must be considered prior to investing in a leveraged fund strategy. Given that these funds are designed to be traded daily, trading volumes must be considered to ensure that cost-in/cost-out isn’t deteriorated by spreads. Traders must also consider additional taxes on short-term capital gains as well as trading fees prior to considering a leveraged trading strategy. You can review additional risks here . Before making a trading or investment decision in leveraged strategies, be sure to fully understand your risk profile and set a trading mandate to manage these risks. I believe preemptively setting parameters for selling out of a position is prudent in ensuring that an investor appropriately manages downside risk. Final Thoughts CONL provides traders with an appealing wrapper for amplifying returns on COIN shares on a daily basis. Taking into consideration historical performance and minimal deviation from the target multiple over COIN shares, I believe CONL may be an appealing ETF for those seeking higher risk exposure. I am recommending CONL with a BUY rating.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4800919-conl-displays-substantial-exposure-to-bitcoin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET","COIN|CONL",cryptocompare

The $1.6 trillion banking giant’s “Cross-Asset Winners & Losers” report, released July 9, revealed Bitcoin’s impressive 18.2% year-to-date gain, decisively outpacing traditional safe-haven currencies including the Swedish krona, Swiss franc, and euro. Source: Cointelegraph on X Meanwhile, the US dollar has plummeted 10.1% since January, claiming last place among the 14 tracked asset classes. This institutional endorsement arrives as Bitcoin climbed multiple all-time highs, surging past $118,856 amid massive buying pressure from spot ETFs and corporate treasuries. US-based Bitcoin ETFs recorded over $1 billion in daily inflows for two consecutive days, a first since their January 2024 launch. US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded over $1 billion in inflows for two straight days, a first since their launch in January 2024. #Bitcoin #ETFs https://t.co/O32A2zt4ry — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 12, 2025 BlackRock’s IBIT alone attracted $953 million on Friday, helping push total ETF assets above $140 billion. The surge coincided with President Trump’s social media declaration that crypto is going “through the roof,” triggering massive institutional repositioning. Because of these institutional validations and growing demand, Bitcoin has positioned itself for continued parabolic growth toward $150,000 and beyond. Institutional Cup and Handle Formation Points to $150,000 Target Bitcoin’s technical structure reveals compelling evidence of massive institutional accumulation through multiple cup and handle patterns across different timeframes. Source: Coinvo on X The weekly chart shows Bitcoin completing what could be the largest cup and handle formation in its history, with the current pattern forming across the $60,000-$110,000 range. Previous cup formations in the $25,000-$30,000 and $50,000-$70,000 ranges led to explosive breakouts toward $70,000 and $100,000, respectively. Taking it even further, the gold versus Bitcoin comparison chart reveals similarities in institutional accumulation patterns. Gold’s prolonged sideways trading around $2,100 created cup-shaped accumulation zones before breaking into a rally reaching $3,354, representing a 60% increase. Bitcoin currently mirrors this exact pattern, having tested and retested resistance around $106,500 before breaking above $118,000. Indirectly, the methodical nature of this accumulation indicates institutional players are gradually building positions without disrupting market movement. Furthermore, exchange reserves data provides fundamental confirmation of the supply shock driving prices higher. Bitcoin held on exchanges declined dramatically from 3.25 million to 2.55 million BTC, removing nearly 700,000 BTC from readily available trading inventory. This represents 3.3% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply being withdrawn for long-term storage. The trajectory suggests reserves could decline to 2.0-2.2 million BTC, reaching the lowest levels since early 2018. The RSI climbing to 73.56 indicates overbought conditions similar to late May when Bitcoin stalled near $110,000. However, institutional accumulation creates different market dynamics than retail-driven rallies. The persistent buying pressure from ETFs, corporate treasuries, and sovereign entities suggests any pullbacks to $110,000-$111,000 would be quickly absorbed, creating launching pads for moves toward $120,000-$125,000. Elliott Wave Analysis Signals Sovereign Adoption Supercycle Bitcoin’s complete cycle chart shows the cryptocurrency in Wave 5 of a larger supercycle driven by institutional and sovereign adoption rather than retail speculation. Unlike previous waves fueled by halving events and retail FOMO, the current phase involves strategic allocation models from entities planning minimum 20-year holding periods. This fundamental shift creates more persistent demand patterns that could sustain higher prices for extended periods. The chart annotations reference countries potentially using Bitcoin to address national debt, indicating sovereign wealth funds and central banks entering the market. These represent the largest capital pools globally, and their participation would dwarf previous institutional adoption waves. Polymarket odds now suggest close to 80% probability of Bitcoin reaching $120,000 by month-end, with 92% likelihood of hitting this level before year-end. BTC strike prices on Polymarket? Oh heck yeah! But it's not even mid-July and we already hit $118,000 $120,000 seems easy $999,969 programed HIGHER pic.twitter.com/DchAgWQ5Tw — Wendy O (@CryptoWendyO) July 12, 2025 Particularly, President Trump’s proposal for a historic 300 basis point interest rate cut creates ideal conditions for Bitcoin’s continued ascent. The massive monetary expansion would trigger massive dollar debasement while driving institutional money into non-sovereign assets. Historical analysis projects dramatic asset price inflation, with the dollar’s weakness positioning Bitcoin as a primary beneficiary of continued currency depreciation. These policy tailwinds and accelerating institutional adoption suggest Bitcoin could reach $150,000 – $200,000 as traditional resistance levels become irrelevant in pure price discovery mode. BTC Hyper: Unlocking Bitcoin’s DeFi Potential During the Bull Run As Bitcoin reaches new heights, limitations around transaction speed and fees become increasingly apparent for investors seeking to maximize their holdings’ utility. BTC Hyper emerges as a compelling solution, offering a Layer-2 scaling platform built on the Solana Virtual Machine that makes Bitcoin transactions instant and cost-effective while unlocking DeFi opportunities previously unavailable to BTC holders. The $HYPER token presale has already raised over $2.5 million, offering early investors high APY staking rewards ahead of the Q3/Q4 2025 mainnet launch. Unlike traditional Bitcoin investments that remain static, BTC Hyper enables users to bridge their BTC holdings and access DeFi platforms, NFT marketplaces, and gaming dApps. The wrapped Bitcoin functionality allows seamless movement between the Bitcoin mainnet and the Hyper network without KYC requirements for core features. With mainnet deployment scheduled for late 2025, BTC Hyper positions itself perfectly for Bitcoin’s institutional adoption wave. Early adopters can purchase $HYPER tokens using ETH, USDT, or BNB through platforms like Best Wallet, with major exchange listings planned post-mainnet launch.

Flutter, which owns gambling sites Betfair and Paddy Power, disclosed that up to 800,000 customers have had their personal information exposed due to a third-party breach, the Irish Times reports . In an email to customers in Ireland and Britain, Flutter said it had “recently detected that an unauthorised third party [gained access] to limited betting account information” relating to some of its customers. The breach involved customers’ usernames, email addresses and IP addresses, but in certain cases, address details were also exposed. Flutter told customers that the hack involved “details of some recent activity on your account and technical data like your device ID and IP address”. “The nature of this incident means that regrettably, some of your personal information has been impacted.” A spokesperson for the company told the Irish Times that no passwords, ID documents or usuable card or parment details were impacted. The company now says that “the unauthorised access has been removed and the incident contained” and that an investigation found that the “affected information was isolated to limited betting account information”. Flutter also promises a full investigation and to examine how to prevent any similar breaches from occurring in the future.

2025-07-13T10:36:08,"Bitcoin's anonymous creator, Nakamoto climbs to 11th richest spot with Bitcoin wealth","Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous creator of Bitcoin, is the 11th richest man in the world. His fortune of 1.096 million BTC currently equates to $129.23 billion based on data from Arkham Intelligence. Although Forbes’s real-time billionaire tracker doesn’t officially include Satoshi Nakamoto, its data would place him in 11th position. In that spot, he’d surpass Michael Dell, whose net worth is $125.1 billion. Sergey Brin currently holds 10th place with $140.3 billion. In order for Satoshi Nakamoto to become the richest man in the world and take Elon Musk’s spot, the price of a single Bitcoin needs to be around $366,241. This will make his Bitcoin holdings of 1.095 million BTC equivalent to roughly $401.0 billion. To reach that valuation, each Bitcoin would need to rally by more than 180% from its present price. Analyst predicts Bitcoin at $400,000 Months ago, anonymous crypto trader apsk32 predicted that Bitcoin would hit the $400,000 price point. His prediction is based on a mathematical model of network growth. The analyst created a model that consists of three plots. The first plot shows historical gold prices in US dollars per ounce. The second plot shows Bitcoin’s market capitalization against the price of gold. Apsk32 stated that BTC is following the path of gold, which hit an all-time high of $3,500.05 per ounce. He explained that modeling Bitcoin’s price against the US dollar doesn’t make sense, as the Federal Reserve will continue to print money. Bitcoin’s gold normalized market cap based on power law. Source: apsk32 via X. The growth of Bitcoin’s market capitalization measured in gold ounces follows a straight line, which is clear in the top-left plot. This straight line suggests that Bitcoin follows a power law, aligning with Metcalfe’s Law of network growth. The analyst then calculated Bitcoin’s implied prices in US dollars based on BTC’s supply at every point in time and gold’s historical data. In the third plot, he created a log plot like Bitcoin’s famous Rainbow price chart, but added Bitcoin’s implied prices over the past 16 years. In terms of support bands, he added a blue band named “years-ahead.” The support bands “years-ahead” range from 0 through 5 years ahead of the underlying implied BTC price or power line. According to historical data, Bitcoin’s price has stayed below the five-years-ahead line, even during previous bubbles. This framework identifies realistic BTC price ranges and shows that, for this cycle, the one-year-ahead band lines up at around $400,000. Reaching that BTC price target would make Satoshi Nakamoto the richest person on Earth. In the past 7 days, Bitcoin has gained over 9.6%, jumping from $108,301 to its all-time high of $118,667 based on CoinGecko data. Currently, Bitcoin trades at $117,934 with a 24-hour trading volume of $19.8 billion. The crypto king has a market capitalization of $2.343 trillion with 19,891,615 coins in circulation.

2025-07-13T10:30:49,"Who Flipped The Switch? Bitcoin STHs Accumulate While LTHs Take Profit","Over the last month, Bitcoin ranged within the $100,000 — $110,000 price region until its recent breakout to reach a new all-time high. On-chain data show that a shift in BTC holder behavior may have played a significant role in the flagship cryptocurrency’s recent price action. LTHs Begin Distributing, But STHs Accumulate In a July 12 post on the X platform, on-chain analyst Boris explained how a shift in Bitcoin holder activity has affected the market over the past months. This explanation was based on indicators measuring the Accumulation Vs Distribution of Long-Term Holders (LTH) and Short-Term Holders (STH). For these two holder categories, the metric tracks and analyzes wallet behavior to determine whether they are increasing or decreasing their Bitcoin holdings over time. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks Records: What Miners and Leverage Traders Are Doing Behind the Scenes For the long-term holders, the chart above shows how accumulation grew from the later days of May to the end of June. This is represented by the growing green graphs over the red. Within the same timeframe, the chart below shows short-term holders were represented more by the red graphs than the green, indicating more distribution than accumulation in the past month. Boris credited the LTHs for Bitcoin’s survival above the $100,000 support zone. “Despite heavy STH distribution and retail selling pressure, BTC defended the 100K support — a clear sign of structural accumulation led by LTH wallets,” the on-chain analyst said. According to Boris, the short-term holders were observed to have sold more than 563,000 BTC as Bitcoin continued to range. As this happened, the Long-Term holders steadily accumulated Bitcoin, and this absorbed most of the selling pressure from STHs. However, this dynamic seems to have reversed very recently. The online pundit reported that the Long-Term Holders started distributing their Bitcoin holdings. This sell-off from the LTHs may be a result of profit-taking, as the cryptocurrency’s upward drift would necessitate. On the other hand, the short-term holders have started to accumulate Bitcoin. This trend seen with this reactive group of investors indicates renewed retail interest or speculative entry amidst the current bullish rally. Boris further inferred that this handover from LTH support to STH support must have fuelled Bitcoin’s latest breakout, as short-term momentum is injected into the market. What’s Next For Bitcoin? While this rotation of supply between holder classes may not be strange in crypto market cycles, the scale and timing of this switch suggest that Bitcoin’s price action holds more interesting rallies in the near future. However, if the short-term buying pressure should taper, the absence of long-term support may cause a lower support to be retested. As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at $117,300, reflecting no significant movement in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Bitcoin Soars Past $118,800—Breakout Or Brutal Bull Trap?

Former Merrill Lynch employee Isaiah Thomas Williams is now banned from the securities industry after being accused of stealing $2.58 million from the account of retired NFL player Reshad Jones, reports WPLG Local 10. Williams allegedly stole $1.58 million from Jones’ account in 133 wire transfers while acting as his financial advisor from January 2022 to March 2024. Police also accuse Williams of laundering $1.03 million from Jones’ account with the aid of 37-year-old Dallas resident Octavia Monique Graham. According to the police, Williams received $435,000 from Graham’s checking account between October 2019 and September 2021. Williams also allegedly received $184,000 from Graham via 88 Zelle transfers. Court documents reveal that Williams used the former Miami Dolphin safety’s money to pay off his credit card bills and fund an extravagant lifestyle that included first-class airline tickets, shopping sprees abroad, hotel accommodations and nightclub trips. He also used Jones’ money to purchase luxury items such as high-end clothes and jewelry, as well as pay for child support and legal fees. Williams was arrested on June 25th and released on July 2nd after posting a $1 million bail. Says Bank of America, “Whenever we learn of potential wrongdoing, we promptly investigate, fully cooperate with regulators and law enforcement, and work with the client to compensate them for any harm caused by an employee.

In a new interview with David Rubenstein, Dalio addresses the US dollar’s big decline against major currencies this year, saying that it could be foreshadowing an incoming phase of stagflation, which refers to a time of high inflation, high unemployment, and low economic growth. Dalio says in the end, while the dollar may underperform other currencies, those currencies also won’t be doing well relative to hard assets like gold. “I think the picture would be some version very similar to the 70s… And the 70s was a period in which there was stagflation. The thing we have to worry about is a stagflationary environment, because all the currencies went down. So when you were looking at ‘diversification,’ the problems that we’re talking about are not just American problems. We have a significant problem, but they’re European problems, they’re Japanese problems. There are Chinese problems. We’ve lived on promises, to be able to take that debt asset and convert it into money. And now there’s not enough money to go around, so I would say that when you ask the question, does it devalue in relation to other currencies? Probably, but the other currencies won’t see much of an appreciation. So that’s why I’m saying something like gold will be the better-performing currency.” The hedge fund legend recently warned that in order to address a looming fiscal crisis, the US government would need to cut spending and raise taxes to lower the annual deficit to gross domestic product (GDP) ratio. “This printing and devaluing is not good for those holding bonds as a storehold of wealth, and what’s bad for bonds and US credit markets is bad for everyone because the US Treasury market is the backbone of all capital markets, which are the backbones of our economic and social conditions. Unless this path is soon rectified to bring the budget deficit from roughly 7% of GDP to about 3% by making adjustments to spending, taxes, and interest rates, big, painful disruptions will likely occur.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

At press time, the token traded at $2.80, up 1.5% in the past 24 hours. Earlier today, it even hit $2.90 before easing back. Traders haven’t seen XRP at these levels since the first week of March, and chatter is growing across trading desks and social channels.

Still, only 28 out of the top 100 non‑stablecoin tokens have outpaced Bitcoin over the past 90 days, keeping the Altcoin Season Index at just 28/100.

Don’t be surprised if you wake up randomly this week and $XRP is $4+ — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) July 12, 2025 XRP Finds Path To $4 Based on reports, crypto educator Edoardo Farina tweeted that seeing XRP north of $4 “as early as this week” wouldn’t be a shock. Pushing past $4 would mean a 50% jump from current levels and clear the old all‑time high of $3.85 set in January 2018. Such a move could come in a fast burst rather than a slow grind, driven by sudden FOMO among buyers chasing new peaks. Ripple Partnerships And ETF Push Ripple has been busy on the partnership front. In early July, the company teamed up with BNY Mellon to custody its RLUSD stablecoin, the 8th‑largest stablecoin by market cap, aiming to draw in big institutions. Meanwhile, futures‑based XRP ETFs from ProShares and others launched in July, and more than 10 spot‑XRP ETF applications are now under SEC review. Any green light on a spot ETF could send demand—and price—higher. XRP Price Prediction According to the latest price prediction, XRP is expected to slip by 0.62% and reach $2.75 by August 12, 2025. Technical indicators still lean bullish, and the Fear & Greed Index sits at 74 (Greed). Over the last 30 days, XRP posted 18/30 green days with 6.88% price swings, data from CoinCodex shows.

Bo Hines, who leads the White House’s focus on crypto, recently made a headline-grabbing statement, saying it is time to make America the leader in this space. This comes as Bitcoin holds its rally, Ethereum pushes above $3,000, and all other top altcoins have also managed to make impressive weekly gains, reflecting strong confidence across the market. JUST IN: 🇺🇸 US Director of Digital Assets says ""huge week ahead… time to make America the crypto capital of the world."" — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) July 11, 2025 But price moves are only part of the story. Congress is about to examine key legislation, including the CLARITY Act and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, aimed at creating a clear legal structure for digital assets as well, during the period that has been officially termed by the entity as “ Crypto Week ”. At the same time, the Federal Reserve faces its own storm: reports suggest Chair Jerome Powell may soon step down, and many expect interest rate cuts as early as next month. This combination of regulatory progress and economic change is drawing attention from across the financial world. JUST NOW: The Chairman of the board of Fannie & Freddie says he is encouraged that Fed Chair Jerome Powell is considering to resign. We have no confirmed reports on Powell saying he’s considering this.Trump can’t fire him, but if Powell does leave on his own…Oh boy. pic.twitter.com/eh5MlwIN79 — amit (@amitisinvesting) July 11, 2025 For investors, this moment offers more than just a fast-moving market and presents a window to focus on cryptocurrencies and platforms with meaningful purpose and the tools to succeed. With momentum across price action, policy, and institutional involvement, this period stands out as one of the most promising for careful and forward-looking crypto investment. Best Crypto to Buy Now As the Next Few Weeks Look Bullish for Quality Projects Buying and stocking up on high-quality cryptos right now may be a great idea, especially with the developments happening across the crypto space. From popularity to concept, some projects lead the space right now and are thus worthy of considering as well. Top options include: Snorter Snorter has steadily become one of the most interesting tools for crypto users who rely on Telegram for managing their activity. It is not just another bot that delivers price alerts or surface-level updates. Instead, Snorter offers a deeper layer of functionality: AI-powered portfolio tracking, predictive analytics, and advanced market data, all within the simplicity of Telegram’s interface. This makes it valuable not only for experienced traders but also for newer participants who want better insights without being overwhelmed by multiple platforms. At a time when optimism is returning to crypto markets, tools like Snorter become even more relevant. Bitcoin’s surge has reignited interest across the board, and with Federal Reserve rate cuts expected, there is a renewed sense that altcoins and niche platforms may have months of opportunity ahead. Snorter is seen as a gateway for users to handle this fast-moving environment more effectively. Its capabilities and potential for growth were discussed by ClayBro in one of his videos on YouTube, which has furthered the demand for SNORT as well. Its AI models offer users data-backed perspectives, helping them track wallet performance, assess token movement, and explore market patterns, all while staying in one place. This helps avoid the friction of navigating between apps, giving users a smoother experience. As regulatory developments in the U.S. begin to create a clearer playing field, Snorter is the type of tool that is set to benefit: practical, adaptable, and focused on delivering real value to people looking to make smarter moves in a maturing crypto space. Token 6900 Token 6900 has built its name not as just another meme coin but as a community-powered project that runs on humor, unpredictability, and collective energy. While it began as a playful experiment, it has grown into something with its own economy, where holders engage directly in decisions, liquidity activities, and creative initiatives. Token 6900’s approach is unconventional, but that is exactly what has given it staying power. It does not rely on marketing stunts or polished campaigns; instead, it thrives on the strength and creativity of its holders, who continuously bring fresh life to the project. In today’s environment, where Bitcoin’s rise and major U.S. policy steps are creating stronger interest in crypto, Token 6900 offers something that sets it apart from more typical assets. It has proven it can hold the attention of its community over time without needing to fit into a predictable mold. That kind of resilience matters, especially as the market prepares for changes in regulation and financial conditions, including the anticipated rate cuts. What makes Token 6900 worth watching now is not just its culture, but its ability to translate that culture into action. With an active user base and ongoing participation in shaping its direction, it represents a project that can continue to evolve on its own terms. For those looking for projects with spirit, independence, and a real base of support, Token 6900 offers a rare combination that has already shown it can last beyond temporary market excitement. Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper is designed to address one of the oldest challenges in crypto: Bitcoin’s limitations as a transaction network. While Bitcoin has always been a powerful store of value, its scalability issues have made it less practical for everyday use. Bitcoin Hyper steps in here, offering a Layer 2 solution that supports faster transactions, lower costs, and a more flexible environment for applications like micropayments and smart contracts. Rather than competing with Bitcoin, it strengthens its potential by building a support layer that expands what the network can handle. In the current climate, where Bitcoin’s surge has reignited worldwide attention and the U.S. is moving toward more structured regulation, platforms like Bitcoin Hyper stand to play an important role. The upcoming discussions in Congress on key crypto legislation, combined with the likelihood of Federal Reserve rate cuts, have created a moment where innovation matters as much as price. Bitcoin Hyper offers something tangible: it makes Bitcoin more useful for a wider range of use cases, from merchants needing fast settlement to developers creating decentralized applications. As institutional players and policymakers align around the idea of advancing digital assets, Bitcoin Hyper is positioned as a critical part of Bitcoin’s evolution. For investors looking to focus on projects that offer practical solutions and long-term relevance, Bitcoin Hyper delivers a clear value proposition, not by promising to replace Bitcoin, but by helping it meet the demands of a changing global financial landscape.

The likely rate cuts in the coming months add another dimension, as easier liquidity often brings waves of new retail participants into the market. In that environment, wallets that can handle not just storage but also engagement with the broader crypto ecosystem are poised to play a crucial role. Best Wallet offers that combination: a secure foundation paired with access to the expanding world of decentralized finance, giving users both protection and opportunity in one place. Conclusion Bitcoin’s surge past its all-time high has not only lifted market sentiment but has also renewed attention across the entire sector. With the U.S. preparing meaningful legislation, the Federal Reserve indicating possible rate cuts, and institutional voices entering the discussion, the environment is shifting toward one that supports growth and innovation in digital assets. This makes it an excellent time to look at projects like the ones discussed above. They are not only relevant because of market hype but because they bring forward real ideas, real tools, and real communities. In a market where both sentiment and substance matter, such projects are well placed to benefit from the positive momentum. For those seeking smart entry points into crypto, the current landscape offers a rare balance of excitement and depth, making now a promising moment to consider adding strong, utility-focused assets to the portfolio.
