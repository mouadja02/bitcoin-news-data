Despite President Trump’s trade war, BofA strategists including Savita Subramanian and Jill Carey Hall predict that the S&P 500 will hit 6,300 by the end of the year and skyrocket to 6,600 in 12 months, reports Bloomberg. BofA strategists say America’s economic engine remains resilient. “Despite tentative trade deals, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and receding recession risks, policy uncertainty is near all-time highs and sovereign yields are at multi-decade highs. But corporate transparency has remained intact… Volatility in currency, inflation and rates have failed to rattle S&P 500 margins since Covid – corporates either adapted or dropped out of the index.” BofA’s bullish stance comes as one wealth advisory firm says investors are becoming increasingly optimistic about the trajectory of the S&P 500. In a new CNBC interview, Payne Capital Management senior wealth advisor Courtney Garcia says tariff headlines are no longer rattling investor confidence, as markets grow accustomed to Trump’s threats being delayed or dialed back. “I think what the market is starting to realize is that these are just getting pushed down the line… There are no really tariff deadlines that are coming. They just keep getting pushed out indefinitely, and that’s where markets are saying, ‘Okay, this isn’t probably as bad as we expected,’ at least in the first week of April, which markets have already moved past. I think at this point, markets are more focused on almost a Goldilocks scenario, that interest rates are probably coming down later this year, growth is actually still strong, inflation is starting to come down. I think that’s what the market is pricing in.” Payne Capital Management is a New York-based registered investment advisor that oversees $1.06 billion in assets.

2025-07-13T08:06:17,"XLM, HBAR Extend Massive Gains as BTC Stands Still Despite Trump’s New Tariffs: Weekend Watch","Bitcoin’s muted price actions during the weekend continued in the past 24 hours as the asset calmed following the explosive rally observed from Wednesday to Friday. In the meantime, many altcoins have extended their gains, with XLM, HBAR, and BONK emerging as today’s top performers. BTC Stalls at $118K Recall that bitcoin’s price volatility had largely disappeared since the start of the month, as the asset was confined within a relatively tight range between $105,000 and $110,000. Following a few unsuccessful attempts for a breakout, though, came Wednesday evening when the bulls took full control of the market. During the first wave north, they pushed the cryptocurrency beyond $110,000 and all the way up to $112,000, which set a new all-time high. While bitcoin retraced slightly on the next day, its rally couldn’t be contained yet, and it shot up to $116,000 on Thursday. Friday saw another impressive leg up that drove the primary digital asset ot almost $119,000 , which became its latest all-time high. This meant that BTC had added over ten grand in less than 48 hours to set a new record. You can check some of the possible reasons behind this mindblowing surge here . Saturday saw little to no action, even though Trump slapped the EU and Mexico with 30% tariffs and warned there would be more if they responded. BTC slipped slightly to $117,500 but has managed to recover the losses and is back to $118,000 as of press time now. Its market cap remains close to $2.350 trillion, making bitcoin the sixth-largest global asset . BTCUSD. Source: TradingView These Alts Keep Rocking Most altcoins have stalled similar to BTC over the past day or so, but XLM and HBAR stand in a league of their own. The former has added another 17.5% in the past day, extending its weekly gains to over 85%. HBAR has surged by nearly 15% daily and almost 50% weekly, which has pushed its price well beyond $0.22. BONK completes the double-digit price pump club, with a 12% surge of its own. Other big gainers from the larger-cap alts include ALGO, IMX, and MNT, but their increases are noticeably smaller. The cumulative market cap of all crypto assets has gained around $20 billion overnight and is up to $3.760 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

2025-07-13T07:31:10,"6 Reasons Behind Bitcoin’s Surge to Uncharted Territory: Can They Push BTC Even Higher?","Bitcoin’s price revival at the end of the business week caught many short traders off guard as the asset skyrocketed to a new all-time high of almost $119,000 following an extended period of muted movements. Although there was not one single big announcement that could have been related to the explosive rally, there are several reasons that were building up for weeks, which could be attributed to the new peak. Overall Accumulation The following reasons will be combined into one category of “overall accumulation,” even though they may vary by investor type, different moments of purchases, etc. We will start with the ETFs as they’re the freshest. As reported yesterday, the spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US attracted more than $2.7 billion within the past five trading days alone. In addition, they have seen only one day in net outflows since June 9. Both of these factors can drive the underlying asset’s price north, especially when investors spend more than $2 billion to accumulate ETF shares in two consecutive days (July 10 and 11). Next, we will list the accumulation by large companies. Strategy, which admittedly failed to announce a purchase last week, has spent billions in the past few months to acquire more BTC. Its example has been followed to a smaller extent by other companies that now hold bitcoin as a reserve asset, such as Metaplanet , GameStop , and Semler Scientific . Although these purchases might not impact the asset’s price immediately, their continuous efforts certainly play a role as they reduce the immediate selling pressure. The accumulation trend expands well beyond institutions and large companies. Glassnode reported recently that smaller investors, categorized as shrimps, crabs, and fish (wallets holding less than 100 BTC), have been acquiring more than 19,000 BTC per month. In comparison, miner issuance stands at just 13,400 BTC per month. Looking at accumulation by wallet size: Shrimps, Crabs, and Fish – wallets with $BTC – are accumulating ~19.3k BTC/month, while miner issuance stands at 13.4k BTC/month. Persistent net absorption across a wide base of holders is creating measurable supply-side tightening. pic.twitter.com/ajut5hlpqv — glassnode (@glassnode) July 12, 2025 The aforementioned purchases from various types of investors, most of whom are transferring their BTC holdings out of exchanges, lead us to the next reason (yes, they are related). According to CryptoQuant, the amount of BTC stored on trading platforms has declined to the lowest level in a decade, another signal that investors are looking for the long term. Macroeconomic Reasons The reasons above paint a clear picture that investors are accumulating. Now, let’s get down to why they might be doing so. Although Trump bombarded numerous nations and entire Unions with new sets of tariffs in the past few weeks, including on Saturday, the effect is nowhere near as devastating to BTC as it was back in April. At the time, bitcoin’s price collapsed to a five-month low, while now, the tariffs are somehow considered beneficial for the cryptocurrency. As analysts from QCP put it: “Will Trump delay implementation once again? That remains to be seen. But repeated cycles of tariff threats and postponements have contributed to positive uncertainty. Business sentiment and manufacturing indices have remained firmly in expansion territory.” BREAKING: President Trump sends out more “tariff letters” with the following tariff rates now announced: 1. Brazil: 50% 2. Myanmar: 40% 3. Laos: 40% 4. Cambodia: 36% 5. Thailand: 36% 6. Bangladesh: 35% 7. Canada: 35% 8. Serbia: 35% 9. Indonesia: 32% 10. European Union: 30% 11.… — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) July 12, 2025 In the meantime, we will conclude our reasoning with the declining US dollar index. Experts have long predicted a massive parabolic move for BTC once the greenback loses traction. This is because investors tend to jump into store-of-value assets, such as gold and bitcoin, in times when the dollar is weak. Nicolai Sondergaard, Research Analyst at Nansen, told CryptoPotato that although he didn’t believe this rally was mostly driven by macro events, he thinks certain US policies have attributed to it. “Recent U.S. policy developments such as fiscal expansion and expectations of further monetary easing have created a backdrop that is undeniably favorable for Bitcoin.” Will BTC Keep Surging? The big question now is whether these reasons will continue to push the cryptocurrency higher. In a memo to CryptoPotato , analysts from Bitfinex seemed optimistic. “Unless ETF inflows collapse or macro takes a sharp turn, the structure remains intact. Bitcoin has flipped $111k–$114k into support, and as long as that holds, the trend is higher. For traders, the message is simple: respect the flows, watch for funding dislocations, and stay tactical around round-number resistance levels for Bitcoin.” Nevertheless, they warned that “no rally goes up in a straight line.” The analysts added that BTC could be due for a correction first, as they have already started to “see some signs of temporary exhaustion.” Nansen’s Sondergaard also weighed in on whether bitcoin has the strength to keep marching forward: “Bitcoin recently broke through key liquidation levels and managed to hold above them, which I believe signaled there was more room for upside. On the technical side, Bitcoin’s daily RSI has climbed above 70, which is typical in strong momentum phases. It’s not inherently bearish; RSI rising during price rallies is normal. However, if price continues to rise while RSI starts to diverge or decline, that could be an early signal of fading momentum and the potential for a correction.” The post 6 Reasons Behind Bitcoin’s Surge to Uncharted Territory: Can They Push BTC Even Higher? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",cryptopotato,https://cryptopotato.com/6-reasons-behind-bitcoins-surge-to-uncharted-territory-can-they-push-btc-even-higher/,"BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|FIAT|EXCHANGE","BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|featured1|Bitcoin (BTC) Price",cryptocompare
2025-07-13T07:04:30,"Fold CEO Warns Altcoins To Remain Speculative, Says Bitcoin’s Market Dominance ‘Something That Can’t Be Reversed’","The chief executive of Bitcoin ( BTC ) financial services firm Fold is issuing a warning about altcoins, saying that the crypto king’s market dominance isn’t something that will backtrack. In a new interview with CNBC Television, Fold CEO Will Reeves says that the top crypto asset by market cap’s recent new all-time high was due to a combination of high institutional demand and low supply. “This is what happens when massive demand meets the finite supply of Bitcoin. And what we’re seeing right now is the supply shock in motion. So I’d certainly say what we are seeing is the fundamentals of Bitcoin in play… What we’ve seen recently with the rise of Bitcoin treasury companies, the ETFs (exchange-traded funds) is that entirely new classes of capital are able to invest in the asset. What we’re seeing is what happens when trillions of dollars start knocking on the door – the price tends to go up.” According to Reeves, the market’s appetite for BTC will cause its dominance levels to irreversibly rise – a trend that would leave countless altcoins competing for capital. “Frankly, I think [altcoins] will remain speculative. Bitcoin dominance is at 60% and rising. I think what we’re seeing is an inevitable trend towards the signal, the apex asset. The issue is that Bitcoin is the only credibly neutral digital asset that is in issuance. All the other tokens are still proving extraordinarily speculative use cases without the track record of Bitcoin. And so what we are seeing today is the continued march of Bitcoin dominating this entire market… Ultimately, what we’ve seen is something that can’t be reversed.” Bitcoin is trading for $117,613 at time of writing, a sideways move on the day. Meanwhile, Bitcoin dominance, which measures how much of the total crypto market cap belongs to BTC, stands at 64.58%.

A popular crypto analyst with almost 140,000 followers on X believes this could be just the beginning and envisioned a further surge to and beyond $1 if ADA breaks through a key resistance level, which is being tested now. Cardano $ADA is breaking through a key resistance level, opening the door for a rally to $0.90–$1.20! pic.twitter.com/4dj8jQfJFN — Ali (@ali_charts) July 13, 2025 This important resistance that could hinder ADA’s progress is situated somewhere around $0.74, a level the asset is very familiar with, as it managed to contain its price ascent earlier this year. ADA managed to breach it briefly during the Friday price surge that drove it to a two-and-a-half-month high of almost $0.78, but the bears quickly regrouped and didn’t allow a decisive closure above it. In fact, the last time Cardano’s token traded sustainably above $0.74 was in mid-May. Since then, the asset underwent a substantial correction that drove it down to $0.5 at one point. Nevertheless, ADA is still the top performer on a weekly scale from the 12 largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, having gained almost 30%. Thus, it has increased more than XRP (26%) and HYPE (22%). This impressive price surge comes just a few weeks after IOG proposed that the treasury would trade $100 million worth of ADA for BTC and stablecoins to enhance the blockchain’s DeFi ecosystem. The move met immediate resistance from some members, who claimed that it could lead to a more painful sell-off and price declines. Charles Hoskinson was quick to mock the naysayers after ADA surged past $0.7 and became a top performer. Remember when we were told that a 100 million dollar trade of ada would collapse the price? https://t.co/kYm5CKw97O pic.twitter.com/tPZiROv37i — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) July 11, 2025 The post ADA Is Breaking Out: Will Cardano Surge Past $1 Next? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",cryptopotato,https://cryptopotato.com/ada-is-breaking-out-will-cardano-surge-past-1-next/,"ADA|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET","ADABTC|ADAUSD|Crypto Bits|Crypto News|Cardano (ADA) Price",cryptocompare

Searching for Wynn’s old username, “JamesWynnReal,” on X now returns an error message that says, “This account doesn’t exist.” Right before he deactivated his account, Wynn changed his profile description to “broke.” Wynn’s old X username returns an account error.

Due to this, Wynn received a lot of attention and scrutiny from fellow traders. His strategy relied on making high-leverage bets on Hyperliquid while enjoying the benefits of the resulting social media engagement. More often than not, the trader watched the market react opposite to his bet. Wynn lost hundreds of millions betting on BTC futures During May, Wynn’s position in BTC stood to lose roughly $100 million when Bitcoin’s price slipped below $105k. That triggered liquidations of 949 BTC, effectively erasing his long-BTC holdings. In a post he later removed, Wynn said, “I do not follow proper risk management, nor do I claim to be a professional; if anything, I claim to be lucky. I’m effectively gambling, and I stand to lose everything. I strongly advise people against what I’m doing.” Instead of slowing down, Wynn once again opened a $100 million bet days later. Wynn claimed that market makers were intentionally targeting his positions to force a liquidation. Seeking relief, he asked the community for help. Up to 24 unique wallet addresses sent donation funds to his account. Shortly after receiving those donations, Wynn sold 240 BTC to push down his liquidation price on his remaining positions. Still, the trader couldn’t save his position and ultimately lost over 99 percent of the second $100 million position. $198.68 million got liquidated from the broader crypto market in 24 hours Meanwhile, the broader crypto futures market saw massive liquidations over the last 24 hours. Liquidation data from CoinGlass at press time shows a total of $198.68 million wiped out in perpetual futures. Long positions accounted for $132.75 million of that total, while shorts made up $65.93 million. Ethereum traders felt the pinch as well, with $30.84 million in positions closed out. Of that, $21.14 million were longs and $9.26 million were shorts. XRP followed, tallying $16.89 million in liquidations, $13.27 million on the long side, and $3.62 million short.

2025-07-13T06:00:42,"Dogecoin Replicates Bullish Wave From Nov. 2024 — Why Price Can Rocket Above $1","Dogecoin (DOGE) is predicted to be on the edge of a fresh breakout as its price action replicates the same bullish wave that preceded its explosive rally in late 2024. After months of sideways movement and bearish pressure, the number one meme coin is showing renewed strength, hinting at the start of a significant upward cycle that could propel its price beyond the long-anticipated $1 target . Dogecoin Predicted To Surge 591% To $1 According to a freshly released analysis by TradingView analyst Master Ananda, Dogecoin is exhibiting strong technical patterns that closely mirror its last major bullish breakout from November 2024 . The analysis shows that it’s been over 217 days since the meme coin last delivered a powerful rally, yet it now stands at the brink of another explosive move . The projected Fibonacci extension targets place DOGE as high as $1.168, which would represent a 591% increase from current levels. Notably, after the prolonged bear market that began following Dogecoin’s 2021 all-time high , the meme coin showed signs of life in early 2024, but the real momentum arrived late in 2024. This same setup is reemerging in mid-2025 in the current cycle. Since March, Master Ananda revealed that Dogecoin’s price action has entered a quiet phase with no significant gains but also no deep corrections, establishing a relatively stable foundation. Notably, between May and June, the meme coin faced over eight weeks of bearish pressure , yet it maintained a critical mid-term higher low, signaling strength and accumulation. Over the last three consecutive weeks, Master Ananda’s chart shows that Dogecoin has printed green candles, and this week’s full-bodied green candle at the top signals that a breakout may be imminent. The chart analysis draws clear parallels to October 2024 and early 2021—periods of low volatility that preceded parabolic rallies. If history repeats , Dogecoin could once again deliver astonishing returns, with predictions suggesting a rise to and beyond $1 . Key Fibonacci resistance levels have been spotted around $0.212, $0.313, and finally, $0.394. Dogecoin Targets $0.349 After Breaks Above EMA89 In a subsequent analysis report, Master Ananda revealed that Dogecoin has confirmed the start of a long-term bullish trend after successfully closing above the EMA89, signaling fresh growth and a shifting market structure in favor of bulls . Notably, this critical resistance level has been represented by the blue-dotted line on the daily chart. The TradingView analyst has noted that the next key level to watch is the EMA233, which, once broken with a daily close, will further confirm sustained upward momentum and a complete transition into a long-term bullish phase. Dogecoin is currently trading around $0.2, with near-term targets set at $0.265 and $0.349. Both of these targets align with significant Fibonacci resistance zones and recent structural highs.

The Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric—used to assess whether long-term holders are selling—has returned to a relatively low average despite the rise in price. This suggests that experienced holders are not offloading their positions, but instead continuing to hold through the rally. With long-term holders largely inactive and momentum accelerating, Bitcoin appears to be entering a decisive phase. As macroeconomic conditions remain favorable for risk assets, and with institutional demand rising, all eyes are now on how BTC behaves at these new highs—and whether the rest of the crypto market will follow its lead. Bitcoin Prepares For A Massive Surge Bitcoin continues to trade above key psychological and technical levels, signaling that the market is entering an expansion phase with the potential for a massive surge. After clearing its previous all-time high and consolidating around $117,000, Bitcoin’s structure looks increasingly bullish. Analysts and traders are closely watching on-chain indicators to confirm whether long-term holders are beginning to exit, but so far, the data suggests they are not. Top analyst Darkfost shared relevant insights regarding the Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric, a key tool used to assess long-term holder activity. CDD calculates how long a Bitcoin stays unmoved before a transfer, revealing long-term participants’ behavior. Recently, the metric saw a sharp spike, raising initial concerns about possible distribution. However, it was later confirmed that the move involved 80,000 BTC in an internal transfer — no actual selling occurred. Since that event, the CDD has returned to its previous low range, especially when compared to Bitcoin’s soaring price. This signals that long-term holders are still sitting tight, showing no urgency to sell into strength. Their conviction reflects growing expectations of higher prices ahead, supported by macro conditions, increasing adoption, and rising institutional interest. With strong hands holding firm and momentum building, Bitcoin appears poised for continuation. As long as key support levels are maintained and long-term holders remain inactive, the setup favors an explosive move that could redefine price discovery in this cycle.

Thursday’s candle closed firmly above the former record cluster at $109,300, opening the door for a vertical push that carried price to $118,800 on the very next print. The candle body towers well above the 50‑period SMA, while the 100‑ and 200‑period averages slope higher beneath, confirming a bullish long‑term structure. The old resistance band between $105,000 and $109,300 now flips into first demand; any orderly retest that wicks into that zone would likely attract sidelined buyers. Below it, $103,600—the mid‑range support that capped drawdowns all spring—remains the line in the sand for the current trend.

Momentum oscillators on medium time‑frames are stretched but not at extreme levels, suggesting room for continuation before a cooling period becomes necessary.

2025-07-13T05:51:50,"Retail Investors Sit Out Bitcoin Rally as Institutions Drive ETF Surge","Despite Bitcoin hitting new all-time highs last week, retail investors have been notably absent from the action, according to market analysts. Meanwhile, institutional interest has surged, particularly in the form of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which saw more than $1 billion in inflows on both Thursday and Friday — a back-to-back milestone never previously achieved. Institutional Surge Behind Latest Price Move Bitwise head of research André Dragosch observed in a Friday post that although Bitcoin is soaring, mainstream interest has yet to catch up. “Bitcoin is at new all-time highs but retail is almost nowhere to be found,” he wrote, referencing data showing weak Google search trends for the term “Bitcoin.” This suggests the current rally is primarily fueled by institutions, not individual investors. Search Trends Fail to Reflect Price Surge Google Trends data supports this narrative. Between June 29–July 5 and July 6–12, global searches for “Bitcoin” increased by just 8%, even as Bitcoin’s price broke past its previous all-time high of $111,970 and continued climbing to $118,780 by Friday. This subdued retail interest contrasts sharply with the surge seen in November 2024, when search interest peaked following Donald Trump’s election win. At that time, retail engagement helped propel Bitcoin past the $100,000 mark for the first time. Retail Sentiment: “Missed the Boat” Some crypto commentators believe that retail investors are sitting out because they feel priced out of the market. “I think a lot of retail folks find out the price of one Bitcoin is 117k and think, nahhh I missed the boat and don’t even give it a second thought,” said Bitcoin analyst Lindsay Stamp. Cedric Youngelman, host of the Bitcoin Matrix podcast, shared a similar sentiment, asking his followers, “At what Bitcoin price do you think retail wakes up? I’ll go first. I don’t think they’re coming for a long time.” Analysts Say Rally Still Has Momentum Despite low retail participation, market experts believe the current rally has more room to run. Bitcoin on-chain analyst Willy Woo commented, “This run has plenty of legs left in it.” The continued interest from institutional players suggests that Bitcoin’s momentum is far from over. Spot ETFs Remain the Main Driver Spot Bitcoin ETFs had an exceptionally strong week, pulling in a total of $2.72 billion over five trading days, according to Farside data. This wave of capital suggests institutional demand remains robust. However, the trend has raised questions about how to measure actual retail interest in the current market landscape. Cointelegraph recently noted that if the ultimate holders of Bitcoin ETF shares are retail investors, then interpreting on-chain data could become more complex. Conclusion While Bitcoin continues to scale new heights, the retail crowd appears hesitant to reenter the market. Whether due to price anxiety or market fatigue, their absence is notable — especially in contrast to the flood of institutional capital pouring into ETFs. As the rally unfolds, attention now turns to whether retail investors will follow — or continue to watch from the sidelines.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/retail-investors-sit-out-bitcoin-rally-as-institutions-drive-etf-surge/,"BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET|RESEARCH","Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence",cryptocompare

2025-07-13T04:50:28,"Crypto price predictions: Bonk, Alpaca Finance, Kyber Network","The crypto market held steady during the weekend as the recent bull market paused. Bitcoin was trading at $118,000, while some altcoins like Bonk, Alpaca Finance (ALPACA), Kyber Network Crystal (KNC), and Phoenix (PHB) surged by double digits. Bonk price prediction Bonk, the biggest Solana meme coin, has done well in the past few days, moving from a low of $0.000011 to the current $0.00002590, its highest level since May 12. This surge happened in a high-volume environment, with its daily volume soaring to over $1.2 billion, higher than Trump Coin, Pugy Penguins, and Fartcoin, combined. Bonk price has moved above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) and the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level at $0.00002080. The MACD indicator and other oscillators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) have all pointed upwards. Therefore, the token will likely keep rising as bulls target the 50% Fibonacci Retracement level at $0.00003440. A drop below the support at $0.00002080, the 23.6% retracement level will invalidate the bullish Bonk price forecast. Bonk price chart | Source: TradingView Alpaca Finance price forecast One notable thing that happens during a crypto bull run is that some small altcoins jump sharply for no reason. One of those that did that was Alpaca Finance, a decentralized finance (DeFi) product for leveraged products. Alpaca Finance is a crypto project offering leveraged yield farming products. It helps lenders earn safe and stable yields and offers undercollateralized loans for leveraged yield farming positions. Alpaca Finance recently announced that it would shut down its platform following the delisting from Binance. Alpaca Finance 🦙δ0 @AlpacaFinance · Follow After extensive internal deliberation and a thorough evaluation of possible paths forward, we have made the incredibly difficult decision to begin sunsetting Alpaca Finance and all of its products. This choice wasn’t made lightly, but we believe it is the most responsible course 5:42 PM · May 26, 2025 381 Reply Copy link Read 249 replies The daily chart shows that the ALPACA price bottomed at $0.0138 this year, and then rebounded to $0.084. This surge was likely because of the Wyckoff Theory, in which it has now moved into the markup phase. The MACD indicator is about to do a bullish crossover, while the Relative Strength Index has moved to the overbought level. Therefore, the ALPACA price will likely resume the downtrend as the network’s final days arrive. Alpaca price chart | Source: TradingView Kyber Network Crystal price forecast Kyber Network is a platform that describes itself as the liquidity hub for crypto trading. It is a top player in decentralized finance that has handled over $20 billion in volume over time. Kyber Network recently launched KyberSwap Crosschain, a platform that enables swaps across multiple protocols. The daily chart shows that the KNC price went through a short-squeeze, surging from a low of $0.2684 on July 1 to $0.7686, its highest level since December 9. The surge happened after the token formed a falling wedge pattern, a popular bullish reversal pattern. This rally, which happened without any catalyst, will likely be short-lived, which may see it drop to the key support at $0.4265, its highest point on May 12.

2025-07-13T04:11:34,"Bitcoin Miner Bosses Are Raking in Millions – And Investors Are Furious","Executives at US-listed Bitcoin mining firms are taking home pay packages far larger than their peers in energy and IT. Equity-heavy compensation structures are driving up totals and drawing increasing shareholder resistance, according to new findings from VanEck. Miner CEOs Outpace Tech and Energy Peers Across eight miners that VanEck reviewed – Bit Digital, Cipher Mining, CleanSpark, Core Scientific, Hut 8, Marathon Digital, Riot Platforms, and TeraWulf – executive pay averaged $14.4 million in 2024. This is more than double the previous year’s $6.6 million, and significantly above averages in the energy and technology sectors. Such a surge has occurred even as base salaries for mining executives remain broadly in line with other industries, averaging $474,000 in 2023. The primary driver is the sector’s reliance on stock-based compensation, which accounted for 89% of miner executive pay in 2024, compared to lower allocations in comparable sectors. While stock-based incentives can align management with investors, VanEck’s analysis indicates many miners continue to structure these awards with short- to medium-term vesting, limited performance gating, and dilution risks that erode shareholder value. Shareholders appear to be pushing back. Across broader corporate America, nearly 99% of executive pay proposals passed during the 2024 proxy season, while S&P 500 and Russell 3000 companies typically witness 90% or higher support rates. By contrast, Bitcoin miners saw an average support rate of just 64%. Six of the eight miners, including Riot, Core Scientific, Hut 8, Cipher, TeraWulf, and Marathon, have expanded the use of performance stock units (PSUs). These typically vest over multiple years, tied to share price or total shareholder return benchmarks. Marathon has transitioned fully to PSUs in 2025, and Cipher now uses a 50/50 split between restricted stock units and PSUs. Core Scientific reintroduced its long-term incentive plan with performance-linked stock after reorganization. These changes indicate a move away from purely time-based vesting and toward longer-term alignment, although not all firms have fully adopted these practices. CleanSpark, for one, has not implemented PSUs. The same is true for Bit Digital as well. Despite authorizing them, it has yet to issue them according to its latest filings. Pay-for-Performance Misalignment The question of whether these pay structures are delivering value remains. VanEck’s comparison of total executive pay with each miner’s 2024 market-cap growth shows stark contrasts. At TeraWulf and Core Scientific, executive pay amounted to around 2% of the firms’ market-cap increases. This pointed to relatively efficient pay-for-performance alignment. On the other hand, Riot’s executives received $230 million, which is equivalent to 73% of the company’s 2024 market-cap gains, while Marathon’s executive pay was 18% of its market-cap growth. Such disparities have drawn scrutiny, particularly given Riot’s history of shareholder pushback on pay proposals and concerns over dilution tied to expanding equity compensation plans.

In fact, CryptoRank revealed that funding reached $10 billion, making this year its strongest showing since early 2022. The stats come amidst rising Bitcoin prices and a thaw in risk appetite, which encouraged investors to re-engage with the sector. Crypto VC Roars Back According to the report shared by CryptoRank, the recovery was driven heavily by June’s $5.14 billion haul. This period witnessed the highest monthly tally since January 2022, following a long period of sluggish deal activity. The sharp uptick aligns with Bitcoin’s rally above $100,000. During the quarter, major players like Strive Funds, founded by Vivek Ramaswamy, pulled in $750 million for Bitcoin-focused alpha strategies in May. Next up were TwentyOneCapital, which raised $585 million in April, and Securitize, which managed to secure $400 million. Other notable raises included Kalshi, Auradine, ZenMEV, and Digital Asset, which raked in $185 million, $153 million, $140 million, and $135 million, respectively. The venture capital arm of Coinbase, Coinbase Ventures, emerged as the most active investor. It executed 25 deals in Q2, ahead of Pantera Capital, Animoca Brands, and Andreessen Horowitz. Meanwhile, Paradigm led in the number of lead investments, while Galaxy Digital closed its first external venture fund at $175 million, surpassing its initial target to back high-growth crypto subsectors, including stablecoins, tokenization, and payment rails. Amsterdam’s Theta Capital also added over $175 million to its fund-of-funds to support early-stage blockchain startups. Other Trends CryptoRank’s data also shows that while seed-stage deals still command the largest slice of activity at nearly 19%, strategic and Series A rounds are steadily growing with 14% and 6% respectively. Interest in M&A is also picking up as distressed opportunities continue to emerge in the sector, with a share of around 10%. The rebound in venture funding comes amid muted memecoin investment trends. In addition to that, monthly crypto fundraising throughout April, May, and June was led by blockchain services, consistently outpacing DeFi and CeFi.

This asset class raked in $907 million in weekly inflows this past week and marked their best week ever. It is worth noting that the milestone coincided with the period when ETH recorded a 17% weekly gain. Three Consecutive Days of Ethereum ETF Inflows Ethereum ETFs were launched in July 2024, and since that time, it has faced some challenges in hitting a breakthrough. Its inflows have not been as productive as those of Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs. All of a sudden, the Ethereum ETFs registered their best weekly inflows. According to SoSoValue, investors plunged $907.99 million into Ethereum ETFs in the past week alone. E ven crypto market expert Nate Geraci acknowledged the inflows on X , citing that these inflows include three of the top 10 inflow days overall. Markedly, the most significant daily inflows for the week were recorded on July 10, when these funds took in $383.10 million. In addition to July 10, July 9 and 11 were days when the funds recorded top inflow this week. Specifically, the ETFs recorded net inflows of $211.32 million and $204.82 million, respectively, on these days. Ethereum Price Performance and Outlook Meanwhile, Ethereum price has recorded some uptick this week with Bitcoin price climbing to a new All-time-high (ATH) above $117,000. The largest altcoin by market capitalization went above the $3,000 level in the process. The rally ran past 17%, but the coin has since seen some fluctuations. At press time, Ethereum was trading at $2,923.59, corresponding with a 1.51% drop within the last 24 hours. Its market capitalization has also dropped to $353.11 billion, and the 24-hour trading volume has reduced by 53.59% to $20.88 billion. SharpLink Acquired 10,000 ETH to Reinforce its Position Apart from the rally in ETH price, the coin gained attention from an acquisition by SharpLink . Notably, the company purchased 10,000 ETH in exchange for $25,723,680, pegging a unit of ETH at $2,572.37. The acquisition deepens the company’s association with the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. SharpLink’s Ethereum holding has now moved from 205,634 ETH, which was previously disclosed, to about 215,634 ETH.

2025-07-12T21:00:41,"Bitcoin Bulls In Cloud 9? Analyst Identifies Where Risk Lies","After a near-excellent start to the month of July, Bitcoin has performed even more impressively over the past few days. The premier cryptocurrency, after a brief period of sideways momentum earlier this week, has attained a new all-time-high valuation at a price close to $119,000. Unsurprisingly, the Bitcoin market is experiencing a wave of optimism — an inference still heavily backed by the latest on-chain revelation. Bitcoin Market Sentiment Shifts Bullish In a July 11 post on social media platform X, cryptocurrency analytics firm Alphractal delved into the current price action of Bitcoin, offering insights into the cryptocurrency’s future trajectory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Soars Past $118,800—Breakout Or Brutal Bull Trap? The firm’s on-chain observation revolves around the Aggregated Liquidation Levels Heatmap (7 Days) metric, which visualizes price zones with high concentrations of long or short liquidations over a span of 7 days, and the Aggregated Liquidation Levels Heatmap (1 month) which does the same, except that this covers a monthly timeframe. After the most recent Bitcoin price rally to a new all-time high, all of the overleveraged bears had their market positions wiped out. Aided by the short squeeze, which usually follows such large liquidation events, the flagship cryptocurrency still retains its strong bullish momentum and continues to surge. According to Alphractal, the aggregation liquidation levels across different timeframes now show that most current leveraged positions are betting on the Bitcoin price. As the market continues to ascend the charts, investor optimism will turn more positive, which may further push more traders to open long positions in the BTC futures market. However, Alphractal warned against the inclination to be recklessly involved in the current bullish market. “If, for any reason, the price drops $10,000 back to the $107,000 zone, it could be the bulls’ turn to face massive liquidations,” the analytics firm said. The firm went further, explaining that a Bitcoin price drop of that magnitude would have a negative impact on the market optimism. On the bright side, Alphractal also mentioned that such an occurrence could offer new accumulation opportunities in the near future. Still on market optimism, a drop in Bitcoin’s value by $10,000 might lead to a phenomenon referred to as a Long squeeze, where the price of Bitcoin continues to plummet with increased momentum. A long squeeze typically occurs when the falling price of a cryptocurrency (in this case, Bitcoin) forces traders with long positions to sell their assets either to cut losses or to break even. This contributes to the already present bearish momentum and sends the BTC price further south. Amidst Bitcoin’s current rally, Alphractal ultimately advised that traders leverage wisely and with caution, as the market’s next action stands at an unpredictable zone. Bitcoin Price At A Glance Still showing signs of healthy bullish momentum, Bitcoin, as of press time, is valued at around $118,145. Data from CoinGecko shows that the flagship cryptocurrency has jumped by more than 3.34% in the last 24 hours.

2025-07-12T20:45:00,"Bitcoin Momentum Rebuilds — TON and SUI Hit Technical Buy Zones","Bitcoin has officially reclaimed center stage, crossing the $118,000 mark for the first time in history. Fueled by a record-setting short squeeze and ETF inflows, the breakout is triggering capital shifts across the market. SUI and Toncoin are showing signs of strength—but it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE, a decentralized political memecoin, that’s quietly entering buy-zone discussions among early-stage investors looking for high-conviction narratives in the next altcoin wave. Bitcoin’s Breakout Powered by Short Squeeze and ETF Inflows The Bitcoin rally has been nothing short of historic. Between July 10–11, over $1 billion in short positions were liquidated, marking the largest forced buyback event since January. Spot ETF inflows continue to accelerate, bringing institutional demand and long-term price pressure. Bitcoin 7-Days price chart from CoinGecko Market sentiment is bullish, with open interest now clustering at the $120K and $140K strike levels. U.S. legislators are also preparing pro-crypto bills as part of an upcoming “Crypto Week,” reinforcing optimism heading into Q3. But the more telling trend? Altcoin rotations are already underway—particularly toward early narratives and low-cap bets. SUI Holds Above $3.50 as DeFi Integrations Fuel Speculation SUI is emerging as one of the most technically robust altcoins this week. After integrating tBTC—a synthetic Bitcoin asset—into its DeFi ecosystem, SUI soared above $3.50 and confirmed its inverse head-and-shoulders breakout pattern. Analysts now point to $3.89 as the next resistance target, with institutional accumulation growing and daily volume tracking higher. It’s a clear indicator that DeFi-aligned narratives are back in focus, especially those with cross-asset bridges and liquidity inflows. But SUI’s surge is also creating spillover attention for projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE—those operating in entirely different lanes but benefiting from renewed risk appetite. TON Rebounds Near $2.97 After Visa Controversy Cools Down Toncoin (TON) is stabilizing near $2.97 after weathering a wave of investor uncertainty related to its failed “golden visa” pilot in the UAE. The TON Foundation clarified its limited role in the proposal, and traders are once again watching the charts. TON’s symmetrical triangle setup signals a potential volatility breakout. Support at $2.81 has held, and sentiment is slowly improving, although technical indicators remain mixed. Analysts caution that TON needs a clean break past $3.00 to resume its previous trend. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Political Altcoin Narrative Enters Buy-Zone Phase While BTC, SUI, and TON dominate headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is making noise where it matters—wallets, volume, and forums. The meme-powered altcoin recently passed $11.2 million raised with over 5,234 verified holders. But what’s attracting fresh attention is the breakout behavior: weekly volume is up 320%, and 1,500+ new wallets were created in under 48 hours. MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t riding ETF news or protocol upgrades—it’s leading with ideological clarity. As a decentralized political memecoin, its zero-tax model, HashEx-audited contract, and capped 170B supply structure offer a scarcity play built on anti-centralization values. Early discussions suggest listing momentum could follow if current community traction continues. Traders who missed early SHIB or DOGE waves are calling MAGACOIN “the politically aligned altcoin for this cycle.” Final Thoughts Bitcoin is climbing. SUI is strengthening. TON is stabilizing. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging—fast. As traders look for early-stage opportunities beyond hype cycles, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s mix of community governance, transparent supply, and political identity makes it a serious contender in the next meme altcoin breakout. For a market driven by narratives and timing, this decentralized political memecoin checks both boxes.

2025-07-12T20:26:00,"Cardano price prediction 2025-2031: Will ADA recover to $3 soon?","Key takeaways : Cardano’s price is expected to surpass $0.7827 in 2025. By 2028, ADA/USD could decline and reach $2.63. By 2031, Cardano might reach a maximum price of $8.61 Cardano is a third-generation blockchain platform launched in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson. Designed for decentralized applications and smart contracts, it uses Ouroboros—a unique, energy-efficient Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. Cardano’s two-layer architecture separates transactions from smart contracts, enhancing scalability and flexibility. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is used for transaction fees, staking, and governance, allowing holders to influence the platform’s future. Emphasizing a research-driven, peer-reviewed development approach, Cardano aims to tackle blockchain challenges like scalability and sustainability, making it a strong alternative to platforms like Ethereum. Perhaps you’re wondering: with its innovative technology, can Cardano’s ADA reach new all-time highs soon? Let’s uncover what the future holds for Cardano. Overview Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $0.7066 Market Cap $21 Billion Trading Volume (24-hour) $677 Million Circulating Supply 45 Billion ADA All-time High $3.10 on Sept 02, 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on Oct 01, 2017 24-hour High $0.7427 24-hour Low $0.6902 Cardano price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 8.23% 50-day SMA $ 0.669534 14-Day RSI 47.74 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 74 (Greed) Green Days 14/30 (47%) Cardano ADA recovers slightly ADA price analysis 1-day chart ADAUSD chart by TradingView Cardano (ADA) has shown a strong bullish rebound on the 1-day chart on. J, climbing to approximately $0.71. The RSI stands at 66.28, suggesting increasing bullish momentum but also approaching the overbought threshold, which often precedes short-term consolidation. The MACD remains positive, with the MACD line above the signal line, indicating sustained upward pressure. Bollinger Bands have widened with the price testing the upper band, reinforcing a volatile breakout move. If ADA maintains this strength, it could challenge the next resistance near $0.75 to $0.80. However, any pullback might retest the $0.68 zone as support before continuation or correction. ADA price analysis 4-hour chart ADAUSD chart by TradingView Based on the 4-hour chart of Cardano (ADA), the price has demonstrated a strong recovery, trading near $0.705. The Bollinger Bands show expansion with ADA testing the upper band, signaling bullish volatility. The Balance of Power (0.83) favors buyers, suggesting dominance of bullish sentiment. However, the MACD histogram reveals some waning momentum as the MACD line dips slightly below the signal line, hinting at short-term indecision. Despite this, the overall structure supports a continuation of the uptrend if ADA holds above $0.68. Failure to maintain momentum could trigger a correction toward the middle Bollinger Band near $0.67 for support. ADA technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 $ 0.591013 SELL SMA 5 $ 0.604081 SELL SMA 10 $ 0.586336 SELL SMA 21 $ 0.598662 SELL SMA 50 $ 0.669534 SELL SMA 100 $ 0.677483 SELL SMA 200 $ 0.612612 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 $ 0.611091 SELL EMA 5 $ 0.635019 SELL EMA 10 $ 0.654165 SELL EMA 21 $ 0.669998 SELL EMA 50 $ 0.710588 SELL EMA 100 $ 0.747892 SELL EMA 200 $ 0.722727 SELL What to expect from Cardano price analysis next Based on both the 4-hour and 1-day charts, Cardano (ADA) is showing signs of bullish continuation with strong momentum building. On the 1-day chart, ADA has reclaimed the $0.70 zone and broken through the upper Bollinger Band, signaling heightened volatility and buyer strength. The RSI at 66.28 suggests ADA is approaching overbought territory but still has room to run. On the 4-hour chart, buyers remain in control, supported by a high Balance of Power (0.83) and expanding Bollinger Bands. If bulls sustain pressure above $0.68, ADA may target $0.75 next. A break below $0.68 could invite consolidation or retracement. Is Cardano a good investment? Cardano (ADA) presents a mixed investment opportunity. It is a third-generation blockchain that aims to solve scalability issues and enhance security through its Proof-of-Stake mechanism. While some analysts predict significant price increases by 2030, others caution that it remains a high-risk investment due to the volatile nature of the crypto market. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and research before investing, as Cardano’s future performance is uncertain and contingent on market conditions and technological advancements. What will Cardano be worth in 2025? ADA might reach a maximum price of $5.97, with an average trading price of about $5.17 and a minimum price of $5.03. What will Cardano be worth in 2030? In 2030, ADA’s average forecast price could be $5.82. Its minimum and maximum trading price is expected to be $5.63 and $6.75, respectively. What is the Cardano forecast for 2040? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2040 is highly speculative as it depends on multiple factors, including adoption, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and macroeconomic conditions. However, if Cardano continues its development in smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and blockchain efficiency, it could see widespread adoption, driving its price higher. Some optimistic projections suggest that ADA could reach double-digit prices, possibly ranging from $10 to $50 or more, if the cryptocurrency market continues to expand and Cardano establishes itself as a leader in blockchain technology. However, in a bearish scenario, where regulatory hurdles and competition slow its progress, ADA could struggle to maintain high valuations. What will be the future price of Cardano in 2050? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2050 is highly speculative, but if blockchain adoption continues to grow and Cardano successfully scales its smart contract ecosystem, its price could see significant appreciation. In a bullish scenario, ADA could reach $50 to $100 or even higher if it becomes a dominant blockchain platform with real-world utility in finance, governance, and enterprise solutions. However, in a bearish scenario where adoption stagnates or regulations hinder growth, ADA could remain below $10. The price will depend on mass adoption, technological advancements, global regulations, and overall cryptocurrency market trends over the coming decades. Will Cardano recover? Cardano’s recovery potential depends on market sentiment and adoption. Despite past challenges, its projected price increase in 2025, potentially reaching $1, has significantly bolstered confidence in the coin’s future. Will Cardano reach $5? Based on our analysis, Cardano will reach $5 by 2030, with a forecasted range of around $5.97. This projection is driven by Cardano’s continued technological advancements, growing adoption, strategic partnerships, and increasing market confidence, indicating a positive long-term growth trajectory for the cryptocurrency market. Will Cardano reach $10? ADA is predicted to reach $7.33 by 2031. By this time, the coin is expected to attain a maximum price of $8.61. Will Cardano reach $50? Cardano is trading around $0.5823, with an all-time high of $2.80 in early 2021. While not impossible, reaching $50 in the next few years is highly uncertain. Does Cardano have a good long-term future? Cardano (ADA) has the potential for a positive long-term future, primarily driven by its technological advancements and growing ecosystem. Predictions indicate that by 2030, Cardano could see significant growth, with estimates suggesting a rise to around $6.75. The platform’s unique features, such as its focus on scalability and partnerships with various institutions, position it well for future adoption. However, its success will depend on overcoming regulatory scrutiny and developer engagement challenges.

The report notes active DRep participation, a 30% rise in stablecoin market cap, a 13% increase in DeFi diversity score, and a 5% growth in treasury balance (ADA).
