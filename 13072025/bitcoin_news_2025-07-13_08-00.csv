2025-07-13T04:50:28,"Crypto price predictions: Bonk, Alpaca Finance, Kyber Network","The crypto market held steady during the weekend as the recent bull market paused. Bitcoin was trading at $118,000, while some altcoins like Bonk, Alpaca Finance (ALPACA), Kyber Network Crystal (KNC), and Phoenix (PHB) surged by double digits. Bonk price prediction Bonk, the biggest Solana meme coin, has done well in the past few days, moving from a low of $0.000011 to the current $0.00002590, its highest level since May 12. This surge happened in a high-volume environment, with its daily volume soaring to over $1.2 billion, higher than Trump Coin, Pugy Penguins, and Fartcoin, combined. Bonk price has moved above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) and the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level at $0.00002080. The MACD indicator and other oscillators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) have all pointed upwards. Therefore, the token will likely keep rising as bulls target the 50% Fibonacci Retracement level at $0.00003440. A drop below the support at $0.00002080, the 23.6% retracement level will invalidate the bullish Bonk price forecast. Bonk price chart | Source: TradingView Alpaca Finance price forecast One notable thing that happens during a crypto bull run is that some small altcoins jump sharply for no reason. One of those that did that was Alpaca Finance, a decentralized finance (DeFi) product for leveraged products. Alpaca Finance is a crypto project offering leveraged yield farming products. It helps lenders earn safe and stable yields and offers undercollateralized loans for leveraged yield farming positions. Alpaca Finance recently announced that it would shut down its platform following the delisting from Binance. Alpaca Finance 🦙δ0 @AlpacaFinance · Follow After extensive internal deliberation and a thorough evaluation of possible paths forward, we have made the incredibly difficult decision to begin sunsetting Alpaca Finance and all of its products. This choice wasn’t made lightly, but we believe it is the most responsible course 5:42 PM · May 26, 2025 381 Reply Copy link Read 249 replies The daily chart shows that the ALPACA price bottomed at $0.0138 this year, and then rebounded to $0.084. This surge was likely because of the Wyckoff Theory, in which it has now moved into the markup phase. The MACD indicator is about to do a bullish crossover, while the Relative Strength Index has moved to the overbought level. Therefore, the ALPACA price will likely resume the downtrend as the network’s final days arrive. Alpaca price chart | Source: TradingView Kyber Network Crystal price forecast Kyber Network is a platform that describes itself as the liquidity hub for crypto trading. It is a top player in decentralized finance that has handled over $20 billion in volume over time. Kyber Network recently launched KyberSwap Crosschain, a platform that enables swaps across multiple protocols. The daily chart shows that the KNC price went through a short-squeeze, surging from a low of $0.2684 on July 1 to $0.7686, its highest level since December 9. The surge happened after the token formed a falling wedge pattern, a popular bullish reversal pattern. This rally, which happened without any catalyst, will likely be short-lived, which may see it drop to the key support at $0.4265, its highest point on May 12.

2025-07-13T04:30:16,"Indicted Crypto Founder Seeks Pardon From US President Trump","According to the latest report, Anatoly Legkodymov, co-founder of crypto platform Bitzlato, has officially requested a pardon from United States President Donald Trump. Legkodymov, a Russian national, was arrested and charged with operating an unlicensed money transmitting business through his cryptocurrency platform, Bitzlato. After his arrest in January 2023, Legkodymov submitted a guilty plea to one charge of running an unlicensed money-transmitting business in December 2023. On July 18, 2024, a US Judge sentenced the defunct crypto exchange co-founder to time served after spending 18 months in detention at Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Centre (MDC). Co-Founder Seeks Pardon To Avoid French Extradition? In a July 11 report by a Russian media outlet , Ivan Melnikov, vice president of the Russian branch of the International Committee for Human Rights, revealed that Legkodymov has officially asked Trump for a federal pardon. According to Melnikov, this move comes as the French authorities try to extradite the Bitzlato co-founder to France. Reports suggest that the French authorities are trying to extradite Legkodymov to face similar charges of operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business. The Russian engineer faces up to 20 years in France for allowing the transfer of significant funds connected to cyber crimes and attacks. Melnikov told the Russian outlet: Anatoly is not a criminal; he became a target in a political campaign against the crypto market and talented Russian programmers. His decision to ask for a pardon is based on the hope that the US will return to a more balanced and fair approach to digital finance, and that the US and Russia will gradually build dialogue. This request might be more strategic than random, considering that Trump has issued roughly 58 presidential pardons since taking the Oval Office in January. Notably, the US President pardoned the Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht, who was facing two life sentences in federal prison. Has Crypto Completely Won Trump’s Heart? Ross Ulbricht is only one of numerous crypto figures to have received federal pardons from Trump in the past few months. Four former executives of crypto exchange BitMEX, namely Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo, Gregory Dwyer, and Samuel Reed, also received pardons from the president. Earlier in May, former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao revealed that he applied for a pardon from Trump after serving jail time as part of his plea deal with the US Department of Justice. Recent reports suggest that the CEO of the now-defunct FTX exchange Sam Bankman-Fried is also trying to secure a federal pardon from the US President.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/indicted-crypto-founder-seeks-pardon-from-us/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","Crypto News|Bitzlato|Changpeng “CZ” Zhao|French authortity|Sam Bankman-Fried|US President Donald Trump",cryptocompare

2025-07-13T04:11:34,"Bitcoin Miner Bosses Are Raking in Millions – And Investors Are Furious","Executives at US-listed Bitcoin mining firms are taking home pay packages far larger than their peers in energy and IT. Equity-heavy compensation structures are driving up totals and drawing increasing shareholder resistance, according to new findings from VanEck. Miner CEOs Outpace Tech and Energy Peers Across eight miners that VanEck reviewed – Bit Digital, Cipher Mining, CleanSpark, Core Scientific, Hut 8, Marathon Digital, Riot Platforms, and TeraWulf – executive pay averaged $14.4 million in 2024. This is more than double the previous year’s $6.6 million, and significantly above averages in the energy and technology sectors. Such a surge has occurred even as base salaries for mining executives remain broadly in line with other industries, averaging $474,000 in 2023. The primary driver is the sector’s reliance on stock-based compensation, which accounted for 89% of miner executive pay in 2024, compared to lower allocations in comparable sectors. While stock-based incentives can align management with investors, VanEck’s analysis indicates many miners continue to structure these awards with short- to medium-term vesting, limited performance gating, and dilution risks that erode shareholder value. Shareholders appear to be pushing back. Across broader corporate America, nearly 99% of executive pay proposals passed during the 2024 proxy season, while S&P 500 and Russell 3000 companies typically witness 90% or higher support rates. By contrast, Bitcoin miners saw an average support rate of just 64%. Six of the eight miners, including Riot, Core Scientific, Hut 8, Cipher, TeraWulf, and Marathon, have expanded the use of performance stock units (PSUs). These typically vest over multiple years, tied to share price or total shareholder return benchmarks. Marathon has transitioned fully to PSUs in 2025, and Cipher now uses a 50/50 split between restricted stock units and PSUs. Core Scientific reintroduced its long-term incentive plan with performance-linked stock after reorganization. These changes indicate a move away from purely time-based vesting and toward longer-term alignment, although not all firms have fully adopted these practices. CleanSpark, for one, has not implemented PSUs. The same is true for Bit Digital as well. Despite authorizing them, it has yet to issue them according to its latest filings. Pay-for-Performance Misalignment The question of whether these pay structures are delivering value remains. VanEck’s comparison of total executive pay with each miner’s 2024 market-cap growth shows stark contrasts. At TeraWulf and Core Scientific, executive pay amounted to around 2% of the firms’ market-cap increases. This pointed to relatively efficient pay-for-performance alignment. On the other hand, Riot’s executives received $230 million, which is equivalent to 73% of the company’s 2024 market-cap gains, while Marathon’s executive pay was 18% of its market-cap growth. Such disparities have drawn scrutiny, particularly given Riot’s history of shareholder pushback on pay proposals and concerns over dilution tied to expanding equity compensation plans.

2025-07-12T22:08:59,"Bitcoin Surge Ignites $10 Billion Crypto VC Boom: Biggest Funding Quarter Since 2022","Venture capital funding activity picked up sharply in Q2 2025. In fact, CryptoRank revealed that funding reached $10 billion, making this year its strongest showing since early 2022. The stats come amidst rising Bitcoin prices and a thaw in risk appetite, which encouraged investors to re-engage with the sector. Crypto VC Roars Back According to the report shared by CryptoRank, the recovery was driven heavily by June’s $5.14 billion haul. This period witnessed the highest monthly tally since January 2022, following a long period of sluggish deal activity. The sharp uptick aligns with Bitcoin’s rally above $100,000. During the quarter, major players like Strive Funds, founded by Vivek Ramaswamy, pulled in $750 million for Bitcoin-focused alpha strategies in May. Next up were TwentyOneCapital, which raised $585 million in April, and Securitize, which managed to secure $400 million. Other notable raises included Kalshi, Auradine, ZenMEV, and Digital Asset, which raked in $185 million, $153 million, $140 million, and $135 million, respectively. The venture capital arm of Coinbase, Coinbase Ventures, emerged as the most active investor. It executed 25 deals in Q2, ahead of Pantera Capital, Animoca Brands, and Andreessen Horowitz. Meanwhile, Paradigm led in the number of lead investments, while Galaxy Digital closed its first external venture fund at $175 million, surpassing its initial target to back high-growth crypto subsectors, including stablecoins, tokenization, and payment rails. Amsterdam’s Theta Capital also added over $175 million to its fund-of-funds to support early-stage blockchain startups. Other Trends CryptoRank’s data also shows that while seed-stage deals still command the largest slice of activity at nearly 19%, strategic and Series A rounds are steadily growing with 14% and 6% respectively. Interest in M&A is also picking up as distressed opportunities continue to emerge in the sector, with a share of around 10%. The rebound in venture funding comes amid muted memecoin investment trends. In addition to that, monthly crypto fundraising throughout April, May, and June was led by blockchain services, consistently outpacing DeFi and CeFi.

This asset class raked in $907 million in weekly inflows this past week and marked their best week ever. It is worth noting that the milestone coincided with the period when ETH recorded a 17% weekly gain. Three Consecutive Days of Ethereum ETF Inflows Ethereum ETFs were launched in July 2024, and since that time, it has faced some challenges in hitting a breakthrough. Its inflows have not been as productive as those of Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs. All of a sudden, the Ethereum ETFs registered their best weekly inflows. According to SoSoValue, investors plunged $907.99 million into Ethereum ETFs in the past week alone. E ven crypto market expert Nate Geraci acknowledged the inflows on X , citing that these inflows include three of the top 10 inflow days overall. Markedly, the most significant daily inflows for the week were recorded on July 10, when these funds took in $383.10 million. In addition to July 10, July 9 and 11 were days when the funds recorded top inflow this week. Specifically, the ETFs recorded net inflows of $211.32 million and $204.82 million, respectively, on these days. Ethereum Price Performance and Outlook Meanwhile, Ethereum price has recorded some uptick this week with Bitcoin price climbing to a new All-time-high (ATH) above $117,000. The largest altcoin by market capitalization went above the $3,000 level in the process. The rally ran past 17%, but the coin has since seen some fluctuations. At press time, Ethereum was trading at $2,923.59, corresponding with a 1.51% drop within the last 24 hours. Its market capitalization has also dropped to $353.11 billion, and the 24-hour trading volume has reduced by 53.59% to $20.88 billion. SharpLink Acquired 10,000 ETH to Reinforce its Position Apart from the rally in ETH price, the coin gained attention from an acquisition by SharpLink . Notably, the company purchased 10,000 ETH in exchange for $25,723,680, pegging a unit of ETH at $2,572.37. The acquisition deepens the company’s association with the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. SharpLink’s Ethereum holding has now moved from 205,634 ETH, which was previously disclosed, to about 215,634 ETH.

2025-07-12T21:00:41,"Bitcoin Bulls In Cloud 9? Analyst Identifies Where Risk Lies","After a near-excellent start to the month of July, Bitcoin has performed even more impressively over the past few days. The premier cryptocurrency, after a brief period of sideways momentum earlier this week, has attained a new all-time-high valuation at a price close to $119,000. Unsurprisingly, the Bitcoin market is experiencing a wave of optimism — an inference still heavily backed by the latest on-chain revelation. Bitcoin Market Sentiment Shifts Bullish In a July 11 post on social media platform X, cryptocurrency analytics firm Alphractal delved into the current price action of Bitcoin, offering insights into the cryptocurrency’s future trajectory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Soars Past $118,800—Breakout Or Brutal Bull Trap? The firm’s on-chain observation revolves around the Aggregated Liquidation Levels Heatmap (7 Days) metric, which visualizes price zones with high concentrations of long or short liquidations over a span of 7 days, and the Aggregated Liquidation Levels Heatmap (1 month) which does the same, except that this covers a monthly timeframe. After the most recent Bitcoin price rally to a new all-time high, all of the overleveraged bears had their market positions wiped out. Aided by the short squeeze, which usually follows such large liquidation events, the flagship cryptocurrency still retains its strong bullish momentum and continues to surge. According to Alphractal, the aggregation liquidation levels across different timeframes now show that most current leveraged positions are betting on the Bitcoin price. As the market continues to ascend the charts, investor optimism will turn more positive, which may further push more traders to open long positions in the BTC futures market. However, Alphractal warned against the inclination to be recklessly involved in the current bullish market. “If, for any reason, the price drops $10,000 back to the $107,000 zone, it could be the bulls’ turn to face massive liquidations,” the analytics firm said. The firm went further, explaining that a Bitcoin price drop of that magnitude would have a negative impact on the market optimism. On the bright side, Alphractal also mentioned that such an occurrence could offer new accumulation opportunities in the near future. Still on market optimism, a drop in Bitcoin’s value by $10,000 might lead to a phenomenon referred to as a Long squeeze, where the price of Bitcoin continues to plummet with increased momentum. A long squeeze typically occurs when the falling price of a cryptocurrency (in this case, Bitcoin) forces traders with long positions to sell their assets either to cut losses or to break even. This contributes to the already present bearish momentum and sends the BTC price further south. Amidst Bitcoin’s current rally, Alphractal ultimately advised that traders leverage wisely and with caution, as the market’s next action stands at an unpredictable zone. Bitcoin Price At A Glance Still showing signs of healthy bullish momentum, Bitcoin, as of press time, is valued at around $118,145. Data from CoinGecko shows that the flagship cryptocurrency has jumped by more than 3.34% in the last 24 hours.

2025-07-12T20:45:00,"Bitcoin Momentum Rebuilds — TON and SUI Hit Technical Buy Zones","Bitcoin has officially reclaimed center stage, crossing the $118,000 mark for the first time in history. Fueled by a record-setting short squeeze and ETF inflows, the breakout is triggering capital shifts across the market. SUI and Toncoin are showing signs of strength—but it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE, a decentralized political memecoin, that’s quietly entering buy-zone discussions among early-stage investors looking for high-conviction narratives in the next altcoin wave. Bitcoin’s Breakout Powered by Short Squeeze and ETF Inflows The Bitcoin rally has been nothing short of historic. Between July 10–11, over $1 billion in short positions were liquidated, marking the largest forced buyback event since January. Spot ETF inflows continue to accelerate, bringing institutional demand and long-term price pressure. Bitcoin 7-Days price chart from CoinGecko Market sentiment is bullish, with open interest now clustering at the $120K and $140K strike levels. U.S. legislators are also preparing pro-crypto bills as part of an upcoming “Crypto Week,” reinforcing optimism heading into Q3. But the more telling trend? Altcoin rotations are already underway—particularly toward early narratives and low-cap bets. SUI Holds Above $3.50 as DeFi Integrations Fuel Speculation SUI is emerging as one of the most technically robust altcoins this week. After integrating tBTC—a synthetic Bitcoin asset—into its DeFi ecosystem, SUI soared above $3.50 and confirmed its inverse head-and-shoulders breakout pattern. Analysts now point to $3.89 as the next resistance target, with institutional accumulation growing and daily volume tracking higher. It’s a clear indicator that DeFi-aligned narratives are back in focus, especially those with cross-asset bridges and liquidity inflows. But SUI’s surge is also creating spillover attention for projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE—those operating in entirely different lanes but benefiting from renewed risk appetite. TON Rebounds Near $2.97 After Visa Controversy Cools Down Toncoin (TON) is stabilizing near $2.97 after weathering a wave of investor uncertainty related to its failed “golden visa” pilot in the UAE. The TON Foundation clarified its limited role in the proposal, and traders are once again watching the charts. TON’s symmetrical triangle setup signals a potential volatility breakout. Support at $2.81 has held, and sentiment is slowly improving, although technical indicators remain mixed. Analysts caution that TON needs a clean break past $3.00 to resume its previous trend. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Political Altcoin Narrative Enters Buy-Zone Phase While BTC, SUI, and TON dominate headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is making noise where it matters—wallets, volume, and forums. The meme-powered altcoin recently passed $11.2 million raised with over 5,234 verified holders. But what’s attracting fresh attention is the breakout behavior: weekly volume is up 320%, and 1,500+ new wallets were created in under 48 hours. MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t riding ETF news or protocol upgrades—it’s leading with ideological clarity. As a decentralized political memecoin, its zero-tax model, HashEx-audited contract, and capped 170B supply structure offer a scarcity play built on anti-centralization values. Early discussions suggest listing momentum could follow if current community traction continues. Traders who missed early SHIB or DOGE waves are calling MAGACOIN “the politically aligned altcoin for this cycle.” Final Thoughts Bitcoin is climbing. SUI is strengthening. TON is stabilizing. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging—fast. As traders look for early-stage opportunities beyond hype cycles, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s mix of community governance, transparent supply, and political identity makes it a serious contender in the next meme altcoin breakout. For a market driven by narratives and timing, this decentralized political memecoin checks both boxes.

2025-07-12T20:26:00,"Cardano price prediction 2025-2031: Will ADA recover to $3 soon?","Key takeaways : Cardano’s price is expected to surpass $0.7827 in 2025. By 2028, ADA/USD could decline and reach $2.63. By 2031, Cardano might reach a maximum price of $8.61 Cardano is a third-generation blockchain platform launched in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson. Designed for decentralized applications and smart contracts, it uses Ouroboros—a unique, energy-efficient Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. Cardano’s two-layer architecture separates transactions from smart contracts, enhancing scalability and flexibility. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is used for transaction fees, staking, and governance, allowing holders to influence the platform’s future. Emphasizing a research-driven, peer-reviewed development approach, Cardano aims to tackle blockchain challenges like scalability and sustainability, making it a strong alternative to platforms like Ethereum. Perhaps you’re wondering: with its innovative technology, can Cardano’s ADA reach new all-time highs soon? Let’s uncover what the future holds for Cardano. Overview Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $0.7066 Market Cap $21 Billion Trading Volume (24-hour) $677 Million Circulating Supply 45 Billion ADA All-time High $3.10 on Sept 02, 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on Oct 01, 2017 24-hour High $0.7427 24-hour Low $0.6902 Cardano price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 8.23% 50-day SMA $ 0.669534 14-Day RSI 47.74 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 74 (Greed) Green Days 14/30 (47%) Cardano ADA recovers slightly ADA price analysis 1-day chart ADAUSD chart by TradingView Cardano (ADA) has shown a strong bullish rebound on the 1-day chart on. J, climbing to approximately $0.71. The RSI stands at 66.28, suggesting increasing bullish momentum but also approaching the overbought threshold, which often precedes short-term consolidation. The MACD remains positive, with the MACD line above the signal line, indicating sustained upward pressure. Bollinger Bands have widened with the price testing the upper band, reinforcing a volatile breakout move. If ADA maintains this strength, it could challenge the next resistance near $0.75 to $0.80. However, any pullback might retest the $0.68 zone as support before continuation or correction. ADA price analysis 4-hour chart ADAUSD chart by TradingView Based on the 4-hour chart of Cardano (ADA), the price has demonstrated a strong recovery, trading near $0.705. The Bollinger Bands show expansion with ADA testing the upper band, signaling bullish volatility. The Balance of Power (0.83) favors buyers, suggesting dominance of bullish sentiment. However, the MACD histogram reveals some waning momentum as the MACD line dips slightly below the signal line, hinting at short-term indecision. Despite this, the overall structure supports a continuation of the uptrend if ADA holds above $0.68. Failure to maintain momentum could trigger a correction toward the middle Bollinger Band near $0.67 for support. ADA technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 $ 0.591013 SELL SMA 5 $ 0.604081 SELL SMA 10 $ 0.586336 SELL SMA 21 $ 0.598662 SELL SMA 50 $ 0.669534 SELL SMA 100 $ 0.677483 SELL SMA 200 $ 0.612612 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 $ 0.611091 SELL EMA 5 $ 0.635019 SELL EMA 10 $ 0.654165 SELL EMA 21 $ 0.669998 SELL EMA 50 $ 0.710588 SELL EMA 100 $ 0.747892 SELL EMA 200 $ 0.722727 SELL What to expect from Cardano price analysis next Based on both the 4-hour and 1-day charts, Cardano (ADA) is showing signs of bullish continuation with strong momentum building. On the 1-day chart, ADA has reclaimed the $0.70 zone and broken through the upper Bollinger Band, signaling heightened volatility and buyer strength. The RSI at 66.28 suggests ADA is approaching overbought territory but still has room to run. On the 4-hour chart, buyers remain in control, supported by a high Balance of Power (0.83) and expanding Bollinger Bands. If bulls sustain pressure above $0.68, ADA may target $0.75 next. A break below $0.68 could invite consolidation or retracement. Is Cardano a good investment? Cardano (ADA) presents a mixed investment opportunity. It is a third-generation blockchain that aims to solve scalability issues and enhance security through its Proof-of-Stake mechanism. While some analysts predict significant price increases by 2030, others caution that it remains a high-risk investment due to the volatile nature of the crypto market. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and research before investing, as Cardano’s future performance is uncertain and contingent on market conditions and technological advancements. What will Cardano be worth in 2025? ADA might reach a maximum price of $5.97, with an average trading price of about $5.17 and a minimum price of $5.03. What will Cardano be worth in 2030? In 2030, ADA’s average forecast price could be $5.82. Its minimum and maximum trading price is expected to be $5.63 and $6.75, respectively. What is the Cardano forecast for 2040? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2040 is highly speculative as it depends on multiple factors, including adoption, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and macroeconomic conditions. However, if Cardano continues its development in smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and blockchain efficiency, it could see widespread adoption, driving its price higher. Some optimistic projections suggest that ADA could reach double-digit prices, possibly ranging from $10 to $50 or more, if the cryptocurrency market continues to expand and Cardano establishes itself as a leader in blockchain technology. However, in a bearish scenario, where regulatory hurdles and competition slow its progress, ADA could struggle to maintain high valuations. What will be the future price of Cardano in 2050? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2050 is highly speculative, but if blockchain adoption continues to grow and Cardano successfully scales its smart contract ecosystem, its price could see significant appreciation. In a bullish scenario, ADA could reach $50 to $100 or even higher if it becomes a dominant blockchain platform with real-world utility in finance, governance, and enterprise solutions. However, in a bearish scenario where adoption stagnates or regulations hinder growth, ADA could remain below $10. The price will depend on mass adoption, technological advancements, global regulations, and overall cryptocurrency market trends over the coming decades. Will Cardano recover? Cardano’s recovery potential depends on market sentiment and adoption. Despite past challenges, its projected price increase in 2025, potentially reaching $1, has significantly bolstered confidence in the coin’s future. Will Cardano reach $5? Based on our analysis, Cardano will reach $5 by 2030, with a forecasted range of around $5.97. This projection is driven by Cardano’s continued technological advancements, growing adoption, strategic partnerships, and increasing market confidence, indicating a positive long-term growth trajectory for the cryptocurrency market. Will Cardano reach $10? ADA is predicted to reach $7.33 by 2031. By this time, the coin is expected to attain a maximum price of $8.61. Will Cardano reach $50? Cardano is trading around $0.5823, with an all-time high of $2.80 in early 2021. While not impossible, reaching $50 in the next few years is highly uncertain. Does Cardano have a good long-term future? Cardano (ADA) has the potential for a positive long-term future, primarily driven by its technological advancements and growing ecosystem. Predictions indicate that by 2030, Cardano could see significant growth, with estimates suggesting a rise to around $6.75. The platform’s unique features, such as its focus on scalability and partnerships with various institutions, position it well for future adoption. However, its success will depend on overcoming regulatory scrutiny and developer engagement challenges.

Despite consensus expectations of a rate cut in the coming months, Dimon said in a speech in Ireland on Thursday that he thinks the market is underestimating the potential impact of inflation on the Fed’s policymaking, Reuters reports . “I think the possibility of those higher rates (is) higher than anybody else… The market is pricing a 20% chance. I would price in a 40-50% chance. I would put that as a cause for concern.” Dimon says the US government’s tariffs, immigration policies and budget deficit could all have inflationary impacts. Other voices in the financial sector have predicted the opposite for Fed policy. Goldman Sachs Research economists recently estimated there’s more than a 50% chance of the Fed cutting rates at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in September, three months earlier than their previous prediction. The Goldman economists predict 25-basis-point cuts in September, October, and December, and March and June of 2026. The CME FedWatch Tool estimates there’s a 93.3% chance the Fed will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4.25-4.5% at the FOMC meeting in July. The tool, which generates probabilities using the 30-day Fed Funds futures prices, estimates there’s a 59.7% chance the Fed will cut the rate by 25 basis points at the FOMC meeting in September. FedWatch estimates a 0% chance of a rate hike this month or in September.

Mutuum Finance could go past $2 post launch. Bitcoin (BTC) Outlook Amid $120K Buzz Bitcoin is currently trading around $111,271, firmly above $110K after clearing its June high near $110,524.

Institutional inflows remain robust, with over $45B in monthly ETF investments and continued accumulation by whale wallets and long-tenured holders emerging from dormancy. Key support now lies around $105K–$108K, while a sustained breakout above $114K could pave the way for a push toward $120K+.

2025-07-12T19:28:41,"Top Meme Coins Following Bitcoin's Rally: Which Joke Tokens Could Deliver Serious Returns?","Bitcoin's recent surge has stirred excitement across the crypto world, and meme coins are catching the wave. With their playful nature, these tokens often hide potential beneath the humor. This article explores which of these joke coins might offer real gains amidst the buzz, uncovering the ones poised for significant growth. Dogecoin's Shifting Momentum Amid Volatility and Key Levels DOGE price movement over the past month showed a modest increase of about 4%, while the half-year performance reveals a significant decline of nearly 40%. Recent trends indicate a positive spike in the last week, suggesting a short-term bounce as longer-term pressure persists. Current prices range between $0.14 and $0.20, with immediate support at $0.11 and resistance at $0.23. A further resistance level stands at $0.30, while additional support is observed at $0.05. Positive indicators, such as a modest Awesome Oscillator reading of 0.015 and a Relative Strength Index at 66.55, suggest that bulls are gaining momentum. The price remains contained by these technical levels, making a clear trend hard to define. Traders might consider buying near the lower support while preparing for potential corrections as the price reaches the resistance area. SPX6900: Steady Surge Amid Key Price Levels SPX6900 experienced a solid increase of 29.46% in the past week but faced a moderate decline of 2.98% in the last month. Over the previous six months, the coin saw a remarkable growth of 56.76%, indicating a strong upward trend. The trading range has fluctuated between $0.83 and $1.65, suggesting consolidation before potential new highs. Although minor pullbacks occurred monthly, the overall market sentiment remains positive, evidenced by the significant six-month gain. Technical indicators, such as a momentum of 0.33 and an RSI of 61.52, reinforce the positive trend in SPX6900's price behavior. SPX6900 is currently navigating key price levels, testing the range between $0.83 and $1.65, with strong support at $0.46 and resistance near $2.11. Bulls dominate as indicated by recent momentum, but the one-month decline suggests bears still have an impact on short-term price action. The mix of technical signals, including an RSI close to 61.52, highlights a lack of a clear trend, enabling strategic trading within these levels. Traders may consider buying near the support area for potential moderate gains toward the first resistance. A sustained move above $2.11 could indicate a breakout, while failure to hold current levels may lead to further declines. Careful risk management is advised while waiting for clearer price direction. PEPE Market Update: Trends and Key Support-Resistance Levels PEPE experienced a significant surge of 26.18% over the past week, but it slipped 2.24% in the last month and fell 31.40% over the previous six months. This reflects a volatile period where sharp weekly gains contrast with sustained declines, suggesting that rapid recoveries may not reverse the deeper bearish trend established over half a year. The market shows short-term optimism but remains overshadowed by long-term weakness. Current prices are confined within a range where buyers and sellers contest each level. The coin trades between $0.0000075 and $0.0000128, with support at $0.0000053 and resistance at $0.0000159. If prices surpass the main resistance, traders may see momentum toward $0.0000211. An RSI of about 62.98 indicates bullish pressure, but oscillators suggest possible reversals. The market lacks a clear trend, prompting traders to consider buying near support while maintaining tight stops or seeking shorting opportunities near resistance. Monitoring volume and market reactions at these levels is crucial for adjusting strategies effectively. Conclusion DOGE , SPX , and PEPE have shown potential to follow Bitcoin's recent surge. These meme coins have captured public attention and investor interest. DOGE remains a favorite due to its strong community. SPX and PEPE are gaining traction with unique themes and growing awareness. Though risky, they could offer notable returns if trends continue. Keep an eye on these tokens as market dynamics evolve. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-07-12T19:26:00,"Ordinals price prediction 2025 – 2031: Can ORDI surge 100X?","Key Takeaways: Our Ordinals price prediction anticipates a high of $29.81 in 2025. In 2027, it will range between $50.88 and $59.50, with an average price of $52.31. In 2030, it will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. In December 2023, ORDI became the first BRC-20 token to breach $1 billion in market capitalization. Following this achievement, ORDI gained attention from DeFi enthusiasts for its role in innovation. The Ordinals protocol allows data to be embedded directly on Bitcoin’s smallest unit—the Satoshi. ORDI was the first token inscribed on the Ordinals protocol; like Bitcoin, it has a maximum supply of 21,000,000 coins. Currently trading at the $48 mark, investors can’t help but speculate on Ordi’s price trajectory. How high will ORDI go? Can ORDI surge 100x? What will the price of ORDI be in 2030? Let’s explore the ORDI price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ordinals Symbol ORDI Current price $9.11 Market cap $191.46M 24-hour trading volume $90.53M Circulating supply 21M All-time high $96.17 on Mar 5, 2024 All-time low $2.86 on Sep 11, 2023 24-hour high $10.24 24-hour low $8.93 ORDI price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility (30-day variation) 8.41% 50-day SMA $8.46 200-day SMA $16.24 Sentiment Neutral Green days 14/30 (47%) ORDI price analysis On the day of writing (July 12), ORDI’s price dropped by 9.33% in 24 hours and 18.07% in the last thirty days. Its trading volume dropped by 40.35% in 24 hours, as more traders positioned themselves in the market. ORDI/USD 1-day chart ORDIUSD chart by TradingView The Ordinal daily chart shows that ORDI trades above the William alligator trendlines, signaling a bullish market sentiment. The coin has registered positive momentum over the last two weeks. The signal and MACD lines of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator are above zero, signaling a bearish market. At the same time, the relative strength index is in neutral territory at 60. It is overbought when the RSI rises above 70. ORDI/USD 4-hour chart ORDIUSD chart by TradingView Technical analysis of the 4-hour chart shows that ORDI is correcting from a recent high at $9.38. The MACD histogram shows rising negative momentum.

ORDI is indecisive at current levels, with the fear and greed index showing greed among investors. On the charts, it is dropping lower from the recent high after facing resistance at $10. Recent news: Ordinals can now bridge to Cardano Cardano has continued to advance as a venue for Bitcoin Defi, facilitating a transfer of Ordinals to its mainnet. The transaction between Bitcoin and Cardano was facilitated by BitVMX, an interoperability protocol built using the BitVM programming language and unveiled at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. Why is ORDI down? ORDI is in a bear run this year. The drop in the ORDI value could be attributed to the market’s correction from the bull run in the last quarter of 2024. Will ORDI recover? ORDI is trading at its lowest this year and is ripe for a reversal. It should recover in the coming months. Will ORDI reach $50? Yes, ORDI should rise above $50 in 2027. The move will come as the market recovers to previous highs. Will ORDI reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, ORDI will reach $100 in 2029 and reach a maximum price of $130.84. Will ORDI reach $1,000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely that ORDI will get to $1,000 before 2030. What is the prediction for Ordi in 2030? According to the 2030 Ordinals price prediction, they will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. What is the Sats ordinal price prediction for 2050? When we extrapolate Ordi’s price predictions, we find that it is likely to reach a high of $421 in 2050. Does ORDI have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, ORDI will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is ORDI a good investment? ORDI had the first-mover advantage on the Ordinals protocol. ORDI, like Bitcoin, has a capped supply of 21 million coins and should, therefore, become scarce over time. Our Cryptopolitan Price Prediction shows how the coin will gain value in the years to come. Ordinals price prediction July 2025 The Ordinals forecast for July is a maximum price of $9.01 and a minimum price of $6.25. The average trading price will be $7.22.

ORDI’s historic price sentiment ORDI price history by CoinGecko According to CoinMarketCap, ORDi started trading in May 2023 at $25.3466. It later fell, reaching its lowest value of $2.86 in September 2023. Binance listed ORDI on November 17, 2023. However, due to a lack of clear information from Binance, there needed to be more clarity, leading many to mistakenly believe that ORDI was a direct product of the Ordinals protocol. This misunderstanding contributed to ORDI’s dramatic market performance. The meme coin saw a 40% increase in value within a single day, culminating in a 100% rise over four days. Despite these fluctuations, ORDI’s popularity surged, and by the end of 2023, its price had climbed above $50. ORDI peaked in March 2024, hitting an all-time high of $96.17. It later moved into a bear run, and by April, it had already dropped by 50%. It started recovering in November, rising above the $35 mark, and $48 in December. In 2025, the trend quickly reversed and fell below $12 in February and $8 in May. In July, it was trading below $10.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ordinals-price-prediction/,"BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|ICO|ORDI|ZRX|BTC|MARKET","Crypto Price Predictions|ORDI",cryptocompare

According to Wedson, the most interesting Bitcoin Power Law model suggests that the resistance zone lies in the $118.9k to $120k range. Wedson argued that for Bitcoin to break above these levels, it would need to break through a threshold previously identified as the “Alpha Price,” which was previously stated to be above $119,300. According to the analyst, breaking above this level is only possible after a period of consolidation and the elimination of overly optimistic investors from the market. Related News: A Signal for Big Accumulation in 18 Altcoins: Whales Withdrawing Huge Amounts to Cold Wallets from Binance “Once that happens, the doors to higher levels will be wide open,” Wedson said, noting that the potential peak level for this cycle could be in the $143,000 to $146,000 range. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $117,598, up 8.89% in the past week.

In a new interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box, Robinhood CIO Stephanie Guild says that she believes the S&P 500 may close the year at around 6,200, though a move to 6,500 is on the table. “I started [the year] at 6,500. When tariffs hit, I said GDP could come down and that could impact earnings. Usually, a 1% hit on GDP is about a 4% hit on earnings. We’ve seen earnings expectations come down. I said there was risk to 5,800, but I never went there. And now I think there’s risk to 6,500 – obviously we’re over my target. But with the pumping up of potential tariffs now I’m just sort of waiting to see what happens… This is all driven by tariffs, but is driven by our president, who also cares about the economy and wants the economy to grow… If [the Fed] cut, then you definitely get 6,500…because then it just like reaffirms what the market has been hoping for.” Guild also says that ahead of next week’s bank earnings, she believes regional banks will outperform the big banks in the coming months. “I’m more bullish on the regionals than the large [banks]…I think they’ll just benefit more from deregulation. And if we do get some rate cuts this year, which I think we should, but obviously there are reasons why they haven’t been cut yet, then I think you do get a steeper [yield] curve and then that does help [regional banks] as well.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The DOJ says it has identified 324 defendants in an alleged $14.6 billion fraud scheme comprising of several different scam tactics targeting Americans. In one scheme that targeted vulnerable elderly patients – some of whom were in hospices – defendants are accused of applying medically unnecessary amniotic allografts to the patients’ wounds, and then receiving millions of dollars worth of illegal kickbacks from a fraudulent billing scheme. In another alleged fraud, 74 defendants, including 44 licensed medical professionals, are accused of illegally peddling 15 million pills of prescription opioids and other controlled substances. Another charge was filed in the Northern District of Illinois against five defendants, including two owners and executives at Pakistani marketing companies, whose alleged fraud involved a $703 million Medicare scam. The DOJ says victims of the scheme had their identification numbers and other confidential health information stolen through theft and deceptive marketing. As part of the investigation, the DOJ seized $245 million worth of cash, luxury vehicles, cryptocurrency and other assets, “demonstrating the significant return on investment that results from health care fraud enforcement efforts.” Says Robert Murphy of the DEA, “Health care fraud isn’t just theft — it’s trafficking in trust. Today’s announcement shows that when doctors become drug dealers and treatment centers become profit-driven fraud rings, DEA will act… We’re targeting the entire ecosystem of fraud — from pill mills in Texas to kickback clinics exploiting Native communities.
