2025-07-13T11:45:29,"Bitwise CIO Says ‚ÄòUnrelenting Demand‚Äô for Bitcoin Could Boost BTC Closer to $200,000 by End of 2025","The chief investment officer of the crypto asset management firm Bitwise says that aggressive demand for Bitcoin ( BTC ) could boost the crypto king‚Äôs price much higher by the end of the year. In a new interview with CNBC Television, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan says that blue-chip institutions having increasing demand for BTC mixed with its limited supply could push the value of Bitcoin by about 70% from current prices. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs unrelenting demand from corporations and institutional investors, and that‚Äôs colliding with severely limited supply. You know the Bitcoin network only produces 450 Bitcoin per day. Yesterday alone, Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) bought 10,000 Bitcoin. This institutional investment into Bitcoin is a one-time event. It‚Äôs going to take years to play out. But I think over the course of those years, there‚Äôs going to be this persistent bid where there‚Äôs more demand than there is supply. And the natural response to that is what we‚Äôre seeing in the market, which is Bitcoin‚Äôs price goes higher. I think it has a long way to go. I think it could end the year closer to $200,000. So I would get used to this story of new all-time highs.‚Äù Hougan adds that interest in Bitcoin‚Äôs use cases is growing, particularly amid rising geopolitical uncertainty. ‚ÄúBitcoin provides a service which is the ability to store wealth in a digital format without relying on a bank. The vibes are definitely part of it. Vibes influence stocks. They influence bonds, but the underlying driver for the rise is more people want this service that Bitcoin provides. In this uncertain world, where there are tariffs and geopolitical tensions, people want to be able to own their wealth in a digital format.‚Äù Bitcoin is trading for $117,470 at time of writing, a marginal decrease on the day.

2025-07-13T11:45:00,"Animoca Brands Partners with DayDayCook to Manage $100M Bitcoin Treasury","Web3 powerhouse Animoca Brands has entered a strategic partnership with DayDayCook (DDC) Enterprise, a packaged food and meal-prep company, to oversee Animoca‚Äôs Bitcoin holdings and generate yield from its reserves. Key Takeaways: Animoca Brands partners with DayDayCook to manage up to $100 million in Bitcoin reserves. Companies increasingly use Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and a long-term store of value. Institutional Bitcoin holdings surged in Q2 2025. The agreement, a non-binding memorandum of understanding (MOU) announced Thursday , marks a significant step in the growing trend of corporate Bitcoin treasury management. Under the deal, Animoca plans to allocate up to $100 million worth of Bitcoin to DDC for management. Animoca Brands Partnership Comes as Bitcoin Gains Ground as Treasury The partnership reflects an emerging wave of companies integrating Bitcoin into their treasury strategies as a hedge against inflation and a long-term store of value. DayDayCook first revealed its Bitcoin treasury ambitions in May, announcing a target purchase of 5,000 BTC over three years. The company made an initial move by acquiring 21 BTC for its corporate treasury in the same month. This aligns with a broader corporate shift toward Bitcoin adoption, as firms seek to diversify and protect their assets amid economic uncertainty. While the rise of Bitcoin treasury companies signals growing mainstream acceptance, it has also sparked debate among investors. Some see these entities as critical drivers for wider adoption, while others warn of the risks posed by overleveraged firms that could exacerbate market downturns. Food group DDC Enterprise ($DDC) is partnering with #Web3 firm Animoca Brands to boost its new #Bitcoin treasury strategy! Animoca will commit up to $100M in $BTC , and co-founder Yat Siu will join DDC's Bitcoin council. DDC already holds 368 BTC, up 48.3% since mid-June pic.twitter.com/xoUJsNuymy ‚Äî Crypto Rose Channel (@rosycutee2) July 13, 2025 Data from BitcoinTreasuries shows 268 institutions currently hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets, spanning public companies, private firms, government bodies, asset managers, and crypto-focused enterprises. Public companies make up the largest segment, accounting for 147 of these holders. The second quarter of 2025 saw these treasury companies add 159,107 BTC, valued at over $18.7 billion, marking a 23% increase in acquisitions from the previous quarter. Blockstream CEO Adam Back described this trend as a ‚Äúnew altseason ,‚Äù urging traders to shift investments into Bitcoin or Bitcoin treasuries. Analysts Warn of Risks Ahead for Bitcoin Treasury Companies However, despite the enthusiasm, caution persists. Analysts warn many treasury companies may falter when Bitcoin prices fall or when access to affordable corporate financing tightens, potentially leading to significant market corrections. Last week, Glassnode lead analyst James Check raised concerns over the longevity of the corporate Bitcoin treasury strategy, arguing the easy gains might already be gone for new entrants as the market matures. The warning echoes recent comments from Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, who has voiced concerns over the Bitcoin treasury strategies adopted by some publicly traded firms. Sigel singled out the use of at-the-market (ATM) share issuance programs, arguing that these can become dilutive if a company‚Äôs stock price nears its Bitcoin net asset value (NAV). Meanwhile, New York law firm Pomerantz LLP has filed a class action lawsuit against Michael Saylor‚Äôs Strategy, accusing the Bitcoin-focused firm of misleading investors about the profitability and risks of its crypto investment strategy.

2025-07-13T11:36:07,"‚ÄòWe‚Äôll see a monster move‚Äô in altcoins next week, says expert","Economist Henrik Zeberg has predicted a surge across altcoins in the coming week, citing technical patterns that point to a bullish momentum. It‚Äôs worth noting that the cryptocurrency market has been anticipating an altcoin season following sustained Bitcoin ( BTC ) dominance, which culminated in the maiden digital currency trading at a high of $118,000. Zeberg based his projection on the development of ‚Äúwave III of wave 3 of wave C‚Äù in most altcoins, he said in an X post on July 12. I think we will see a monster move in wide range of Alts this coming week. We got wave iii of wave 3 of wave C developing in various Alts. Let's see how this tweet will age üòâ ‚Äî Henrik Zeberg (@HenrikZeberg) July 12, 2025 The waves reference Elliott Wave Theory, which traders use to analyze market psychology and price trends. In this framework, Wave 3 is typically the strongest, with Wave iii representing an especially powerful sub-phase of acceleration. Ethereum to lead altcoin rally He also noted that Ethereum ( ETH ) is already showing the expected breakout and is likely to lead the broader altcoin rally. This behavior is typical of altcoin seasons, when capital rotates out of Bitcoin into smaller cryptocurrencies, amplifying gains across the market. To this end, the expert expects Ethereum to rise further before a summer lull, a period when crypto trading often slows. However, he warned that the rally could be followed by a sharp pullback later in the season, suggesting traders should prepare for significant volatility. At press time, the second-ranked cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading at $2,955, down 0.6% in the last 24 hours. In the past week, ETH has rallied 17%. Meanwhile, cryptocurrency trading expert Micha√´l van de Poppe observed in a July 12 X post that Bitcoin dominance is weakening, with a clear bearish divergence emerging. Historically, such patterns have signaled short-term reversals and triggered rallies in altcoins. Altcoin market analysis chart. Source: TradingView Key support around 54% to 55% is now in focus, and a confirmed drop below this level could drive a rotation into altcoins over the next one to two weeks, as traders seek higher returns outside of Bitcoin. Altcoin market cap flashing bullish signals Additionally, pseudonymous analyst El_crypto_prof, in an X post on July 13, highlighted growing altcoin optimism, noting that the TOTAL3 index (which tracks the altcoin market cap excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum) is flashing a bullish signal. In this case, the weekly MACD has made a bullish cross, a move that has historically marked the start of strong altcoin rallies. Altcoin market analysis chart. Source: TradingView His analysis indicates that the market is breaking out of a descending broadening wedge, a bullish pattern. A similar breakout in November 2024 led to a powerful altcoin rally, and the current setup in July 2025 appears to mirror that move.

2025-07-13T11:30:22,"Complacent markets get a jolt with Trump‚Äôs latest 30% tariff threats","Contrary to investor expectations, Trump announced a 30% tariff rate on the European Union and Mexico, set to take effect on August 1. Markets had started growing complacent to Trump‚Äôs threats, but his latest revelations could change that. Trump insists he will¬†implement¬†more levies on Japan, South Korea, Canada, Brazil, Algeria, and other trading partners, calling on them to negotiate deals. Trump warns that any retaliation will lead to higher levies Bankers and executives, including JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, cautioned against the growing market complacency. However, investors remained adamant, believing the US president would back down on the levies as he had done previously. Meanwhile, Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management, has told investors not to count on Trump dropping his 30% tariff threat on the EU. He called the tariffs ‚Äúpunitive‚Äù but claimed they would harm the EU more than the US, hinting that Trump may not necessarily stop them . So far, Mexico‚Äôs government has called the levies unfair and stressed its independence and sovereignty as a country. On the other hand, the EU Commission‚Äôs chief, Ursula von der Leyen, responded with a warning of reciprocal action . Despite the mounting tensions, both remain open to further negotiations with Washington. In a letter addressed Friday to the European Commission President, he detailed that despite years of dialogue, the US-EU trade relationship remains unbalanced, defined by persistent deficits. While addressing Mexico, President Trump acknowledged their cooperation on border security but remarked, ‚ÄúMexico has been helping me secure the border. BUT, what Mexico has done is not enough,‚Äù hence the 30% tariffs. In both correspondences, however, he clarified that retaliatory actions would prompt the US to raise tariffs even further. Meanwhile, speaking in a Fox News segment that aired on Saturday, the US President noted that several countries were enraged with his decision, but defended the tariffs, claiming they were bringing vast sums of revenue into the country. The EU has been a target for Trump‚Äôs tariffs since April. He initially proposed a 20% levy on goods from the bloc and other trade partners, before later threatening to increase it to 50% as negotiations broke down. Investors react differently compared to when Trump announced his April tariffs Major cryptocurrencies have fallen slightly since Trump‚Äôs tariff announcement. Bitcoin , the top crypto asset by market capitalization, slipped 0.6% from its European session peak of $118,200. Ether (ETH) also declined, trading 1% lower on the day at $2,930 (UTC), while Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE) dropped over 2%. Moreover, the BNB token fell 0.7%. Only XRP gained close to 2% among leading crypto assets after the announcement. Despite the crypto losses, Wall Street investors are proving hard to scare. In Trump‚Äôs tariff notices to his trading allies, he reportedly left room for adjustments that could reduce the rates, and urged his allies to negotiate for better deals. According to Jacobsen, this has calmed some of the investors‚Äô concerns about the tariff situation. He commented, ‚ÄúAs usual, there are many conditions and clauses that can get these rates reduced. That‚Äôs probably why the market might not like the tariff talk, but it‚Äôs not panicking about it either.‚Äù When Trump announced the first batch of reciprocal tariffs in April, the market reacted frantically by selling some of their assets and US treasuries. However, with this round of tariffs, they seem more relaxed, as the president paused all his earlier levies, and they strongly believe he will do the same this time round. Trump‚Äôs setting of the deadline for negotiation on August 1 has not even deterred the markets. However, stocks dwindled marginally on Friday when Trump increased his trade offensive.

2025-07-13T11:23:35,"CONL Displays Substantial Exposure To Bitcoin","Summary CONL offers 2x daily leveraged exposure to Coinbase via swaps, amplifying both gains and losses for active traders. CONL may provide traders with exceptional exposure to bitcoin due to Coinbase's brokerage and lending operations. The ETF is highly liquid with over $1 billion AUM and robust trading volume, creating a viable vehicle for active traders. Given strong historical performance and minimal value decay, I rate CONL a BUY for traders seeking aggressive, short-term COIN exposure. The GraniteShares 2x Long COIN Daily ETF ( CONL ) is a leveraged trading strategy designed to provide traders with 2x the daily performance of Coinbase Global ( COIN ). COIN share performance is relatively correlated to the performance of bitcoin, given the significant exposure to bitcoin transactions Coinbase inherently holds. TradingView In short, Coinbase offers a variety of financial services as a cryptocurrency brokerage platform, including bitcoin collateralized loans. These features may create a certain leveraged-like revenue stream for Coinbase, resulting in substantial relative performance to bitcoin over a long holding period. TradingView CONL does not directly invest in COIN shares, but rather, provides exposure entirely through the use of swap contracts. As a swap payer , CONL receives the daily performance of COIN while paying a fixed rate, providing leveraged exposure to the underlying stock. CONL holds a 200% position by weight in COIN swaps. Because of the daily settlement of the swap options, CONL performance will reflect that of the swaps and reset daily, resulting in the 2x target performance only being applicable to daily performance. Longer holding periods may result in a compounding effect for CONL investors, potentially resulting in excess gains or losses to the performance of COIN shares. Comparing the 1-month performance between CONL and COIN shares, CONL‚Äôs performance has exceeded the 2x daily target, exhibiting the compounding effect to the upside. TradingView Downside risk can also be amplified during extended holding periods tied to the downside performance of the underlying stock. Investors must remain cautious if seeking to hold CONL for an extended period, as consecutive days of downside risk can result in substantial losses to a position in CONL. TradingView Looking at performance since inception, CONL does not exhibit a substantial level of value decay often realized across the leveraged ETF space. Though past performance shouldn‚Äôt be indicative of the future, I believe the market depth and underlying performance of COIN shares have supported relative strength in CONL. TradingView Looking at the ETF components, CONL provides substantial depth for traders to actively manage a position. CONL has $1.02b in assets under management with an average of 7.64mm shares trading hands on a daily basis. This should provide traders with a liquid market for entering and exiting a position, minimizing cost-in/cost-out risk. CONL has a relatively high fee when compared to peer leveraged ETFs of 110bps. It is typical for leveraged strategies to command higher fees and given the market depth, I do not believe a few extra basis points on the fee should be a determining factor for trading this strategy. Seeking Alpha Risks Related to Leveraged Strategies There are inherent risks in investing in leveraged strategies. Because these strategies are meant to achieve their stated multiple over the underlying index on a daily basis, holding these strategies beyond a single day can lead to skewed performance, especially following consecutive days of upside or downside risk. This can lead to a compounding effect as well as value decay as a result of the daily reset in the derivatives positions. Leveraged strategies also add an extra layer of risk to amplified downside potential. For example, if the underlying index were to appreciate by 2% in a single day, a 3x strategy would appreciate by 6%, meaning that an investment of $100 would increase to $106. If the following day results in a -2% decline in the underlying index, or a -6% decline in the leveraged strategy, the investment will decline to $99.64. Holding leveraged strategies for longer than a single day can lead to a compounding effect on one‚Äôs position, potentially leading to significant skews from the intended multiplier. During multiple days of downside risk, an investor can experience significant value decay, potentially resulting in the inability to recover losses. Liquidity must be considered prior to investing in a leveraged fund strategy. Given that these funds are designed to be traded daily, trading volumes must be considered to ensure that cost-in/cost-out isn‚Äôt deteriorated by spreads. Traders must also consider additional taxes on short-term capital gains as well as trading fees prior to considering a leveraged trading strategy. You can review additional risks here . Before making a trading or investment decision in leveraged strategies, be sure to fully understand your risk profile and set a trading mandate to manage these risks. I believe preemptively setting parameters for selling out of a position is prudent in ensuring that an investor appropriately manages downside risk. Final Thoughts CONL provides traders with an appealing wrapper for amplifying returns on COIN shares on a daily basis. Taking into consideration historical performance and minimal deviation from the target multiple over COIN shares, I believe CONL may be an appealing ETF for those seeking higher risk exposure. I am recommending CONL with a BUY rating.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4800919-conl-displays-substantial-exposure-to-bitcoin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET","COIN|CONL",cryptocompare

2025-07-13T11:00:22,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Bank of America Names BTC Best Currency ‚Äì Is Institutional Accumulation Accelerating?","Bank of America has officially crowned Bitcoin as the best-performing currency of 2025, marking a historic milestone in cryptocurrency‚Äôs journey toward mainstream financial acceptance, as Wall Street can‚Äôt ignore it anymore. The $1.6 trillion banking giant‚Äôs ‚ÄúCross-Asset Winners & Losers‚Äù report, released July 9, revealed Bitcoin‚Äôs impressive 18.2% year-to-date gain, decisively outpacing traditional safe-haven currencies including the Swedish krona, Swiss franc, and euro. Source: Cointelegraph on X Meanwhile, the US dollar has plummeted 10.1% since January, claiming last place among the 14 tracked asset classes. This institutional endorsement arrives as Bitcoin climbed multiple all-time highs, surging past $118,856 amid massive buying pressure from spot ETFs and corporate treasuries. US-based Bitcoin ETFs recorded over $1 billion in daily inflows for two consecutive days, a first since their January 2024 launch. US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded over $1 billion in inflows for two straight days, a first since their launch in January 2024. #Bitcoin #ETFs https://t.co/O32A2zt4ry ‚Äî Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 12, 2025 BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT alone attracted $953 million on Friday, helping push total ETF assets above $140 billion. The surge coincided with President Trump‚Äôs social media declaration that crypto is going ‚Äúthrough the roof,‚Äù triggering massive institutional repositioning. Because of these institutional validations and growing demand, Bitcoin has positioned itself for continued parabolic growth toward $150,000 and beyond. Institutional Cup and Handle Formation Points to $150,000 Target Bitcoin‚Äôs technical structure reveals compelling evidence of massive institutional accumulation through multiple cup and handle patterns across different timeframes. Source: Coinvo on X The weekly chart shows Bitcoin completing what could be the largest cup and handle formation in its history, with the current pattern forming across the $60,000-$110,000 range. Previous cup formations in the $25,000-$30,000 and $50,000-$70,000 ranges led to explosive breakouts toward $70,000 and $100,000, respectively. Taking it even further, the gold versus Bitcoin comparison chart reveals similarities in institutional accumulation patterns. Gold‚Äôs prolonged sideways trading around $2,100 created cup-shaped accumulation zones before breaking into a rally reaching $3,354, representing a 60% increase. Bitcoin currently mirrors this exact pattern, having tested and retested resistance around $106,500 before breaking above $118,000. Indirectly, the methodical nature of this accumulation indicates institutional players are gradually building positions without disrupting market movement. Furthermore, exchange reserves data provides fundamental confirmation of the supply shock driving prices higher. Bitcoin held on exchanges declined dramatically from 3.25 million to 2.55 million BTC, removing nearly 700,000 BTC from readily available trading inventory. This represents 3.3% of Bitcoin‚Äôs circulating supply being withdrawn for long-term storage. The trajectory suggests reserves could decline to 2.0-2.2 million BTC, reaching the lowest levels since early 2018. The RSI climbing to 73.56 indicates overbought conditions similar to late May when Bitcoin stalled near $110,000. However, institutional accumulation creates different market dynamics than retail-driven rallies. The persistent buying pressure from ETFs, corporate treasuries, and sovereign entities suggests any pullbacks to $110,000-$111,000 would be quickly absorbed, creating launching pads for moves toward $120,000-$125,000. Elliott Wave Analysis Signals Sovereign Adoption Supercycle Bitcoin‚Äôs complete cycle chart shows the cryptocurrency in Wave 5 of a larger supercycle driven by institutional and sovereign adoption rather than retail speculation. Unlike previous waves fueled by halving events and retail FOMO, the current phase involves strategic allocation models from entities planning minimum 20-year holding periods. This fundamental shift creates more persistent demand patterns that could sustain higher prices for extended periods. The chart annotations reference countries potentially using Bitcoin to address national debt, indicating sovereign wealth funds and central banks entering the market. These represent the largest capital pools globally, and their participation would dwarf previous institutional adoption waves. Polymarket odds now suggest close to 80% probability of Bitcoin reaching $120,000 by month-end, with 92% likelihood of hitting this level before year-end. BTC strike prices on Polymarket? Oh heck yeah! But it's not even mid-July and we already hit $118,000 $120,000 seems easy $999,969 programed HIGHER pic.twitter.com/DchAgWQ5Tw ‚Äî Wendy O (@CryptoWendyO) July 12, 2025 Particularly, President Trump‚Äôs proposal for a historic 300 basis point interest rate cut creates ideal conditions for Bitcoin‚Äôs continued ascent. The massive monetary expansion would trigger massive dollar debasement while driving institutional money into non-sovereign assets. Historical analysis projects dramatic asset price inflation, with the dollar‚Äôs weakness positioning Bitcoin as a primary beneficiary of continued currency depreciation. These policy tailwinds and accelerating institutional adoption suggest Bitcoin could reach $150,000 ‚Äì $200,000 as traditional resistance levels become irrelevant in pure price discovery mode. BTC Hyper: Unlocking Bitcoin‚Äôs DeFi Potential During the Bull Run As Bitcoin reaches new heights, limitations around transaction speed and fees become increasingly apparent for investors seeking to maximize their holdings‚Äô utility. BTC Hyper emerges as a compelling solution, offering a Layer-2 scaling platform built on the Solana Virtual Machine that makes Bitcoin transactions instant and cost-effective while unlocking DeFi opportunities previously unavailable to BTC holders. The $HYPER token presale has already raised over $2.5 million, offering early investors high APY staking rewards ahead of the Q3/Q4 2025 mainnet launch. Unlike traditional Bitcoin investments that remain static, BTC Hyper enables users to bridge their BTC holdings and access DeFi platforms, NFT marketplaces, and gaming dApps. The wrapped Bitcoin functionality allows seamless movement between the Bitcoin mainnet and the Hyper network without KYC requirements for core features. With mainnet deployment scheduled for late 2025, BTC Hyper positions itself perfectly for Bitcoin‚Äôs institutional adoption wave.

The crypto market surged significantly last week as Bitcoin achieved a new all-time high while most top altcoins returned massive gains. However, upcoming economic data due in the US by early next week could affect the market conditions. Most analysts expect increased volatility in the crypto market to follow the outcome of US economic reports. Top among the economic indicators expected this coming Tuesday are the US CPI and Core CPI data.

2025-07-13T10:36:08,"Bitcoin's anonymous creator, Nakamoto climbs to 11th richest spot with Bitcoin wealth","Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous creator of Bitcoin, is the 11th richest man in the world. His fortune of 1.096 million BTC currently equates to $129.23 billion based on data from Arkham Intelligence. Although Forbes‚Äôs real-time billionaire tracker doesn‚Äôt officially include Satoshi Nakamoto, its data would place him in 11th position. In that spot, he‚Äôd surpass Michael Dell, whose net worth is $125.1 billion. Sergey Brin currently holds 10th place with $140.3 billion. In order for Satoshi Nakamoto to become the richest man in the world and take Elon Musk‚Äôs spot, the price of a single Bitcoin needs to be around $366,241. This will make his Bitcoin holdings of 1.095 million BTC equivalent to roughly $401.0 billion. To reach that valuation, each Bitcoin would need to rally by more than 180% from its present price. Analyst predicts Bitcoin at $400,000 Months ago, anonymous crypto trader apsk32 predicted that Bitcoin would hit the $400,000 price point. His prediction is based on a mathematical model of network growth. The analyst created a model that consists of three plots. The first plot shows historical gold prices in US dollars per ounce. The second plot shows Bitcoin‚Äôs market capitalization against the price of gold. Apsk32 stated that BTC is following the path of gold, which hit an all-time high of $3,500.05 per ounce. He explained that modeling Bitcoin‚Äôs price against the US dollar doesn‚Äôt make sense, as the Federal Reserve will continue to print money. Bitcoin‚Äôs gold normalized market cap based on power law. Source: apsk32 via X. The growth of Bitcoin‚Äôs market capitalization measured in gold ounces follows a straight line, which is clear in the top-left plot. This straight line suggests that Bitcoin follows a power law, aligning with Metcalfe‚Äôs Law of network growth. The analyst then calculated Bitcoin‚Äôs implied prices in US dollars based on BTC‚Äôs supply at every point in time and gold‚Äôs historical data. In the third plot, he created a log plot like Bitcoin‚Äôs famous Rainbow price chart, but added Bitcoin‚Äôs implied prices over the past 16 years. In terms of support bands, he added a blue band named ‚Äúyears-ahead.‚Äù The support bands ‚Äúyears-ahead‚Äù range from 0 through 5 years ahead of the underlying implied BTC price or power line. According to historical data, Bitcoin‚Äôs price has stayed below the five-years-ahead line, even during previous bubbles. This framework identifies realistic BTC price ranges and shows that, for this cycle, the one-year-ahead band lines up at around $400,000. Reaching that BTC price target would make Satoshi Nakamoto the richest person on Earth. In the past 7 days, Bitcoin has gained over 9.6%, jumping from $108,301 to its all-time high of $118,667 based on CoinGecko data. Currently, Bitcoin trades at $117,934 with a 24-hour trading volume of $19.8 billion. The crypto king has a market capitalization of $2.343 trillion with 19,891,615 coins in circulation.

2025-07-13T10:30:49,"Who Flipped The Switch? Bitcoin STHs Accumulate While LTHs Take Profit","Over the last month, Bitcoin ranged within the $100,000 ‚Äî $110,000 price region until its recent breakout to reach a new all-time high. On-chain data show that a shift in BTC holder behavior may have played a significant role in the flagship cryptocurrency‚Äôs recent price action. LTHs Begin Distributing, But STHs Accumulate In a July 12 post on the X platform, on-chain analyst Boris explained how a shift in Bitcoin holder activity has affected the market over the past months. This explanation was based on indicators measuring the Accumulation Vs Distribution of Long-Term Holders (LTH) and Short-Term Holders (STH). For these two holder categories, the metric tracks and analyzes wallet behavior to determine whether they are increasing or decreasing their Bitcoin holdings over time. Related Reading:¬†Bitcoin Breaks Records: What Miners and Leverage Traders Are Doing Behind the Scenes For the long-term holders, the chart above shows how accumulation grew from the later days of May to the end of June. This is represented by the growing green graphs over the red. Within the same timeframe, the chart below shows short-term holders were represented more by the red graphs than the green, indicating more distribution than accumulation in the past month. Boris credited the LTHs for Bitcoin‚Äôs survival above the $100,000 support zone. ‚ÄúDespite heavy STH distribution and retail selling pressure, BTC defended the 100K support ‚Äî a clear sign of structural accumulation led by LTH wallets,‚Äù the on-chain analyst said. According to Boris, the short-term holders were observed to have sold more than 563,000 BTC as Bitcoin continued to range. As this happened, the Long-Term holders steadily accumulated Bitcoin, and this absorbed most of the selling pressure from STHs. However, this dynamic seems to have reversed very recently. The online pundit reported that the Long-Term Holders started distributing their Bitcoin holdings. This sell-off from the LTHs may be a result of profit-taking, as the cryptocurrency‚Äôs upward drift would necessitate. On the other hand, the short-term holders have started to accumulate Bitcoin. This trend seen with this reactive group of investors indicates renewed retail interest or speculative entry amidst the current bullish rally. Boris further inferred that this handover from LTH support to STH support must have fuelled Bitcoin‚Äôs latest breakout, as short-term momentum is injected into the market. What‚Äôs Next For Bitcoin? While this rotation of supply between holder classes may not be strange in crypto market cycles, the scale and timing of this switch suggest that Bitcoin‚Äôs price action holds more interesting rallies in the near future. However, if the short-term buying pressure should taper, the absence of long-term support may cause a lower support to be retested. As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at $117,300, reflecting no significant movement in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Bitcoin Soars Past $118,800‚ÄîBreakout Or Brutal Bull Trap?

Former Merrill Lynch employee Isaiah Thomas Williams is now banned from the securities industry after being accused of stealing $2.58 million from the account of retired NFL player Reshad Jones, reports WPLG Local 10. Williams allegedly stole $1.58 million from Jones‚Äô account in 133 wire transfers while acting as his financial advisor from January 2022 to March 2024. Police also accuse Williams of laundering $1.03 million from Jones‚Äô account with the aid of 37-year-old Dallas resident Octavia Monique Graham. According to the police, Williams received $435,000 from Graham‚Äôs checking account between October 2019 and September 2021. Williams also allegedly received $184,000 from Graham via 88 Zelle transfers. Court documents reveal that Williams used the former Miami Dolphin safety‚Äôs money to pay off his credit card bills and fund an extravagant lifestyle that included first-class airline tickets, shopping sprees abroad, hotel accommodations and nightclub trips. He also used Jones‚Äô money to purchase luxury items such as high-end clothes and jewelry, as well as pay for child support and legal fees. Williams was arrested on June 25th and released on July 2nd after posting a $1 million bail. Says Bank of America, ‚ÄúWhenever we learn of potential wrongdoing, we promptly investigate, fully cooperate with regulators and law enforcement, and work with the client to compensate them for any harm caused by an employee.

In a new interview with David Rubenstein, Dalio addresses the US dollar‚Äôs big decline against major currencies this year, saying that it could be foreshadowing an incoming phase of stagflation, which refers to a time of high inflation, high unemployment, and low economic growth. Dalio says in the end, while the dollar may underperform other currencies, those currencies also won‚Äôt be doing well relative to hard assets like gold. ‚ÄúI think the picture would be some version very similar to the 70s‚Ä¶ And the 70s was a period in which there was stagflation. The thing we have to worry about is a stagflationary environment, because all the currencies went down. So when you were looking at ‚Äòdiversification,‚Äô the problems that we‚Äôre talking about are not just American problems. We have a significant problem, but they‚Äôre European problems, they‚Äôre Japanese problems. There are Chinese problems. We‚Äôve lived on promises, to be able to take that debt asset and convert it into money. And now there‚Äôs not enough money to go around, so I would say that when you ask the question, does it devalue in relation to other currencies? Probably, but the other currencies won‚Äôt see much of an appreciation. So that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm saying something like gold will be the better-performing currency.‚Äù The hedge fund legend recently warned that in order to address a looming fiscal crisis, the US government would need to cut spending and raise taxes to lower the annual deficit to gross domestic product (GDP) ratio. ‚ÄúThis printing and devaluing is not good for those holding bonds as a storehold of wealth, and what‚Äôs bad for bonds and US credit markets is bad for everyone because the US Treasury market is the backbone of all capital markets, which are the backbones of our economic and social conditions. Unless this path is soon rectified to bring the budget deficit from roughly 7% of GDP to about 3% by making adjustments to spending, taxes, and interest rates, big, painful disruptions will likely occur.‚Äù Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat ‚Äì Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

With the price holding firm above $118,000 and many now eyeing the $125,000 level, this seems to carry serious weight. What makes this phase even more important is the surrounding environment. The possibility of Federal Reserve rate cuts combined with strong moves inside U.S. regulatory circles has set the stage for a market that could run higher for months.

Bo Hines, who leads the White House‚Äôs focus on crypto, recently made a headline-grabbing statement, saying it is time to make America the leader in this space.

With momentum across price action, policy, and institutional involvement, this period stands out as one of the most promising for careful and forward-looking crypto investment. Best Crypto to Buy Now As the Next Few Weeks Look Bullish for Quality Projects Buying and stocking up on high-quality cryptos right now may be a great idea, especially with the developments happening across the crypto space.

Snorter is seen as a gateway for users to handle this fast-moving environment more effectively.

Bitcoin Hyper steps in here, offering a Layer 2 solution that supports faster transactions, lower costs, and a more flexible environment for applications like micropayments and smart contracts. Rather than competing with Bitcoin, it strengthens its potential by building a support layer that expands what the network can handle. In the current climate, where Bitcoin‚Äôs surge has reignited worldwide attention and the U.S. is moving toward more structured regulation, platforms like Bitcoin Hyper stand to play an important role. The upcoming discussions in Congress on key crypto legislation, combined with the likelihood of Federal Reserve rate cuts, have created a moment where innovation matters as much as price. Bitcoin Hyper offers something tangible: it makes Bitcoin more useful for a wider range of use cases, from merchants needing fast settlement to developers creating decentralized applications. As institutional players and policymakers align around the idea of advancing digital assets, Bitcoin Hyper is positioned as a critical part of Bitcoin‚Äôs evolution. For investors looking to focus on projects that offer practical solutions and long-term relevance, Bitcoin Hyper delivers a clear value proposition, not by promising to replace Bitcoin, but by helping it meet the demands of a changing global financial landscape.

In the meantime, many altcoins have extended their gains, with XLM, HBAR, and BONK emerging as today‚Äôs top performers. BTC Stalls at $118K Recall that bitcoin‚Äôs price volatility had largely disappeared since the start of the month, as the asset was confined within a relatively tight range between $105,000 and $110,000. Following a few unsuccessful attempts for a breakout, though, came Wednesday evening when the bulls took full control of the market. During the first wave north, they pushed the cryptocurrency beyond $110,000 and all the way up to $112,000, which set a new all-time high. While bitcoin retraced slightly on the next day, its rally couldn‚Äôt be contained yet, and it shot up to $116,000 on Thursday. Friday saw another impressive leg up that drove the primary digital asset ot almost $119,000 , which became its latest all-time high. This meant that BTC had added over ten grand in less than 48 hours to set a new record. You can check some of the possible reasons behind this mindblowing surge here . Saturday saw little to no action, even though Trump slapped the EU and Mexico with 30% tariffs and warned there would be more if they responded. BTC slipped slightly to $117,500 but has managed to recover the losses and is back to $118,000 as of press time now. Its market cap remains close to $2.350 trillion, making bitcoin the sixth-largest global asset . BTCUSD. Source: TradingView These Alts Keep Rocking Most altcoins have stalled similar to BTC over the past day or so, but XLM and HBAR stand in a league of their own. The former has added another 17.5% in the past day, extending its weekly gains to over 85%. HBAR has surged by nearly 15% daily and almost 50% weekly, which has pushed its price well beyond $0.22. BONK completes the double-digit price pump club, with a 12% surge of its own. Other big gainers from the larger-cap alts include ALGO, IMX, and MNT, but their increases are noticeably smaller.

As such, the crypto-linked investment products have witnessed a significant influx of capital in recent weeks. The Bitcoin ETFs, however, witnessed the inflow of an unprecedented amount of capital to close the past week. This significant investor activity came as the price of the premier cryptocurrency forged multiple new all-time highs in the space of a few days. Bitcoin ETFs Record $2.72 Billion In Past Week: Report According to the latest market data , the Bitcoin ETFs in the United States posted a total net inflow of $1.03 billion on Friday, July 11. This outstanding performance marked the second straight day of a 10-figure capital influx for the crypto-based investment vehicles. Unsurprisingly, BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Bitcoin Trust (with the ticker IBIT) witnessed the largest net inflow, adding $953.52 million in value to close the week. This strong performance emphasizes the asset manager‚Äôs growing dominance in the crypto ETFs industry ‚Äî as IBIT also recently became the fastest ETF to hit $80 billion in assets under management. ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) came in second place, registering a net inflow of $23.51 million on Friday. Grayscale‚Äôs Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) and VanEck‚Äôs Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (HODL) also managed to post eight-figure inflows, with $20.93 million and $20.01 million, respectively. Bitwise‚Äôs Bitcoin ETF (BITB) and Invesco‚Äôs fund (BTCO) were the only other funds to record positive inflows to close the week. BITB and BTCO posted $6.41 million and $5.3 million, respectively, on the day. It is worth noting that the other Bitcoin ETFs didn‚Äôt witness any net activity. As earlier mentioned, the US Bitcoin ETFs registered over a billion-dollar net inflow for the second consecutive day ‚Äî for the first time since launching in January 2024. These performances in the past two days pushed the weekly record to around $2.72 billion, the fifth-largest weekly inflow. Bitcoin Price Overview The direct relationship between the Bitcoin price and the US Bitcoin ETFs‚Äô inflows continued in the past week. On both days when the funds witnessed a billion-dollar capital influx, the price of BTC experienced a significant price surge, reaching a new all-time high of around $118,700. As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin sits around $117,332, reflecting a 0.3% decline in the past 24 hours.

2025-07-13T07:31:10,"6 Reasons Behind Bitcoin‚Äôs Surge to Uncharted Territory: Can They Push BTC Even Higher?","Bitcoin‚Äôs price revival at the end of the business week caught many short traders off guard as the asset skyrocketed to a new all-time high of almost $119,000 following an extended period of muted movements. Although there was not one single big announcement that could have been related to the explosive rally, there are several reasons that were building up for weeks, which could be attributed to the new peak. Overall Accumulation The following reasons will be combined into one category of ‚Äúoverall accumulation,‚Äù even though they may vary by investor type, different moments of purchases, etc. We will start with the ETFs as they‚Äôre the freshest. As reported yesterday, the spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US attracted more than $2.7 billion within the past five trading days alone. In addition, they have seen only one day in net outflows since June 9. Both of these factors can drive the underlying asset‚Äôs price north, especially when investors spend more than $2 billion to accumulate ETF shares in two consecutive days (July 10 and 11). Next, we will list the accumulation by large companies. Strategy, which admittedly failed to announce a purchase last week, has spent billions in the past few months to acquire more BTC. Its example has been followed to a smaller extent by other companies that now hold bitcoin as a reserve asset, such as Metaplanet , GameStop , and Semler Scientific . Although these purchases might not impact the asset‚Äôs price immediately, their continuous efforts certainly play a role as they reduce the immediate selling pressure. The accumulation trend expands well beyond institutions and large companies. Glassnode reported recently that smaller investors, categorized as shrimps, crabs, and fish (wallets holding less than 100 BTC), have been acquiring more than 19,000 BTC per month. In comparison, miner issuance stands at just 13,400 BTC per month. Looking at accumulation by wallet size: Shrimps, Crabs, and Fish ‚Äì wallets with $BTC ‚Äì are accumulating ~19.3k BTC/month, while miner issuance stands at 13.4k BTC/month. Persistent net absorption across a wide base of holders is creating measurable supply-side tightening. pic.twitter.com/ajut5hlpqv ‚Äî glassnode (@glassnode) July 12, 2025 The aforementioned purchases from various types of investors, most of whom are transferring their BTC holdings out of exchanges, lead us to the next reason (yes, they are related). According to CryptoQuant, the amount of BTC stored on trading platforms has declined to the lowest level in a decade, another signal that investors are looking for the long term. Macroeconomic Reasons The reasons above paint a clear picture that investors are accumulating. Now, let‚Äôs get down to why they might be doing so. Although Trump bombarded numerous nations and entire Unions with new sets of tariffs in the past few weeks, including on Saturday, the effect is nowhere near as devastating to BTC as it was back in April. At the time, bitcoin‚Äôs price collapsed to a five-month low, while now, the tariffs are somehow considered beneficial for the cryptocurrency. As analysts from QCP put it: ‚ÄúWill Trump delay implementation once again? That remains to be seen. But repeated cycles of tariff threats and postponements have contributed to positive uncertainty. Business sentiment and manufacturing indices have remained firmly in expansion territory.‚Äù BREAKING: President Trump sends out more ‚Äútariff letters‚Äù with the following tariff rates now announced: 1. Brazil: 50% 2. Myanmar: 40% 3. Laos: 40% 4. Cambodia: 36% 5. Thailand: 36% 6. Bangladesh: 35% 7. Canada: 35% 8. Serbia: 35% 9. Indonesia: 32% 10. European Union: 30% 11.‚Ä¶ ‚Äî The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) July 12, 2025 In the meantime, we will conclude our reasoning with the declining US dollar index. Experts have long predicted a massive parabolic move for BTC once the greenback loses traction. This is because investors tend to jump into store-of-value assets, such as gold and bitcoin, in times when the dollar is weak. Nicolai Sondergaard, Research Analyst at Nansen, told CryptoPotato that although he didn‚Äôt believe this rally was mostly driven by macro events, he thinks certain US policies have attributed to it. ‚ÄúRecent U.S. policy developments such as fiscal expansion and expectations of further monetary easing have created a backdrop that is undeniably favorable for Bitcoin.‚Äù Will BTC Keep Surging? The big question now is whether these reasons will continue to push the cryptocurrency higher. In a memo to CryptoPotato , analysts from Bitfinex seemed optimistic. ‚ÄúUnless ETF inflows collapse or macro takes a sharp turn, the structure remains intact. Bitcoin has flipped $111k‚Äì$114k into support, and as long as that holds, the trend is higher. For traders, the message is simple: respect the flows, watch for funding dislocations, and stay tactical around round-number resistance levels for Bitcoin.‚Äù Nevertheless, they warned that ‚Äúno rally goes up in a straight line.‚Äù The analysts added that BTC could be due for a correction first, as they have already started to ‚Äúsee some signs of temporary exhaustion.‚Äù Nansen‚Äôs Sondergaard also weighed in on whether bitcoin has the strength to keep marching forward: ‚ÄúBitcoin recently broke through key liquidation levels and managed to hold above them, which I believe signaled there was more room for upside. On the technical side, Bitcoin‚Äôs daily RSI has climbed above 70, which is typical in strong momentum phases. It‚Äôs not inherently bearish; RSI rising during price rallies is normal. However, if price continues to rise while RSI starts to diverge or decline, that could be an early signal of fading momentum and the potential for a correction.‚Äù The post 6 Reasons Behind Bitcoin‚Äôs Surge to Uncharted Territory: Can They Push BTC Even Higher? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",cryptopotato,https://cryptopotato.com/6-reasons-behind-bitcoins-surge-to-uncharted-territory-can-they-push-btc-even-higher/,"BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|FIAT|EXCHANGE","BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|featured1|Bitcoin (BTC) Price",cryptocompare
2025-07-13T07:30:17,"Bitcoin Price Could Soar To $146K In The Next Leg Up ‚Äî Analyst Explains How","After going on an impressive run to close the week, the Bitcoin price has become relatively steady over this weekend. The premier cryptocurrency has shown some signs of indecision and continued to move sideways within the $117,000 and $118,000 range. According to a prominent online pundit, the Bitcoin price might be at a critical juncture that could decide its future over the next few weeks. Insights from a technical analysis model suggest that the price of BTC might run up to an unprecedented high of $143,000 once it overcomes the next resistance level. BTC Needs To Break This Resistance Level To Continue Rally In a July 12 post on social media platform X, Alphractal founder & CEO Joao Wedson revealed that the Bitcoin price faces significant resistance between $118,900 and $120,000. This price evaluation is based on the Bitcoin Power Law model, which provides a mathematical description of BTC‚Äôs historical price trends. Related Reading: Bitcoin SOPR Signals More Gains Ahead Despite New ATH ‚Äì Analyst The Bitcoin Power Law model estimates the network effect and adoption curve without speculation. Using this framework, the pricing model provides long-term support and resistance levels or ‚Äúbands‚Äù on the Bitcoin price chart. Wedson revealed that the Power Law model indicates that the Bitcoin price faces significant resistance between the $118,900 and $120,000 region. According to the on-chain analyst, the market needs to breach the Alpha Price ‚Äî which lies somewhere around $119,300. For context, the Alpha Price refers to a major inflection point in the Power Law model and a level that the Bitcoin price needs to break and stay above to enter the next significant phase of the bull cycle. In essence, the BTC price must witness a sustained break above $119,300 to continue its rally. Wedson mentioned that the price of BTC will need to show resilience in order to breach the psychological $120,000 level. However, it might need to consolidate first and perhaps take some long traders out of the market before overcoming the $120,000 level, the on-chain analyst noted. According to Wedson, a sustained breach of the $120,000 level¬†will signal the beginning of an even much bigger rally for the market leader. The on-chain analyst put the target for this rally at between $143,000 and $146,000, marking the Bitcoin price top in this cycle. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $117,530, reflecting no significant movement in the past 24 hours. Nevertheless, the flagship cryptocurrency is up by nearly 9% on the weekly timeframe.

2025-07-13T07:04:30,"Fold CEO Warns Altcoins To Remain Speculative, Says Bitcoin‚Äôs Market Dominance ‚ÄòSomething That Can‚Äôt Be Reversed‚Äô","The chief executive of Bitcoin ( BTC ) financial services firm Fold is issuing a warning about altcoins, saying that the crypto king‚Äôs market dominance isn‚Äôt something that will backtrack. In a new interview with CNBC Television, Fold CEO Will Reeves says that the top crypto asset by market cap‚Äôs recent new all-time high was due to a combination of high institutional demand and low supply. ‚ÄúThis is what happens when massive demand meets the finite supply of Bitcoin. And what we‚Äôre seeing right now is the supply shock in motion. So I‚Äôd certainly say what we are seeing is the fundamentals of Bitcoin in play‚Ä¶ What we‚Äôve seen recently with the rise of Bitcoin treasury companies, the ETFs (exchange-traded funds) is that entirely new classes of capital are able to invest in the asset. What we‚Äôre seeing is what happens when trillions of dollars start knocking on the door ‚Äì the price tends to go up.‚Äù According to Reeves, the market‚Äôs appetite for BTC will cause its dominance levels to irreversibly rise ‚Äì a trend that would leave countless altcoins competing for capital. ‚ÄúFrankly, I think [altcoins] will remain speculative. Bitcoin dominance is at 60% and rising. I think what we‚Äôre seeing is an inevitable trend towards the signal, the apex asset. The issue is that Bitcoin is the only credibly neutral digital asset that is in issuance. All the other tokens are still proving extraordinarily speculative use cases without the track record of Bitcoin. And so what we are seeing today is the continued march of Bitcoin dominating this entire market‚Ä¶ Ultimately, what we‚Äôve seen is something that can‚Äôt be reversed.‚Äù Bitcoin is trading for $117,613 at time of writing, a sideways move on the day. Meanwhile, Bitcoin dominance, which measures how much of the total crypto market cap belongs to BTC, stands at 64.58%.

A popular crypto analyst with almost 140,000 followers on X believes this could be just the beginning and envisioned a further surge to and beyond $1 if ADA breaks through a key resistance level, which is being tested now. Cardano $ADA is breaking through a key resistance level, opening the door for a rally to $0.90‚Äì$1.20! pic.twitter.com/4dj8jQfJFN ‚Äî Ali (@ali_charts) July 13, 2025 This important resistance that could hinder ADA‚Äôs progress is situated somewhere around $0.74, a level the asset is very familiar with, as it managed to contain its price ascent earlier this year. ADA managed to breach it briefly during the Friday price surge that drove it to a two-and-a-half-month high of almost $0.78, but the bears quickly regrouped and didn‚Äôt allow a decisive closure above it. In fact, the last time Cardano‚Äôs token traded sustainably above $0.74 was in mid-May. Since then, the asset underwent a substantial correction that drove it down to $0.5 at one point. Nevertheless, ADA is still the top performer on a weekly scale from the 12 largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, having gained almost 30%. Thus, it has increased more than XRP (26%) and HYPE (22%). This impressive price surge comes just a few weeks after IOG proposed that the treasury would trade $100 million worth of ADA for BTC and stablecoins to enhance the blockchain‚Äôs DeFi ecosystem. The move met immediate resistance from some members, who claimed that it could lead to a more painful sell-off and price declines. Charles Hoskinson was quick to mock the naysayers after ADA surged past $0.7 and became a top performer.

Due to this, Wynn received a lot of attention and scrutiny from fellow traders. His strategy relied on making high-leverage bets on Hyperliquid while enjoying the benefits of the resulting social media engagement. More often than not, the trader watched the market react opposite to his bet. Wynn lost hundreds of millions betting on BTC futures During May, Wynn‚Äôs position in BTC stood to lose roughly $100 million when Bitcoin‚Äôs price slipped below $105k. That triggered liquidations of 949 BTC, effectively erasing his long-BTC holdings. In a post he later removed, Wynn said, ‚ÄúI do not follow proper risk management, nor do I claim to be a professional; if anything, I claim to be lucky. I‚Äôm effectively gambling, and I stand to lose everything. I strongly advise people against what I‚Äôm doing.‚Äù Instead of slowing down, Wynn once again opened a $100 million bet days later. Wynn claimed that market makers were intentionally targeting his positions to force a liquidation. Seeking relief, he asked the community for help. Up to 24 unique wallet addresses sent donation funds to his account. Shortly after receiving those donations, Wynn sold 240 BTC to push down his liquidation price on his remaining positions. Still, the trader couldn‚Äôt save his position and ultimately lost over 99 percent of the second $100 million position. $198.68 million got liquidated from the broader crypto market in 24 hours Meanwhile, the broader crypto futures market saw massive liquidations over the last 24 hours. Liquidation data from CoinGlass at press time shows a total of $198.68 million wiped out in perpetual futures.

2025-07-13T06:00:26,"Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Remain Steady As CDD Normalizes After False Alarm","Bitcoin is testing uncharted territory after breaking past its previous all-time high of $112,000 last Thursday, igniting a powerful new phase in the bull market. With the price currently hovering above $117,000, bulls are firmly in control as optimism spreads across the crypto market. The breakout comes after weeks of tight consolidation, signaling renewed confidence among investors and traders. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Continues Historic Climb ‚Äì Altcoins Struggle To Gain Ground On-chain data from CryptoQuant adds further support to the bullish narrative. The Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric‚Äîused to assess whether long-term holders are selling‚Äîhas returned to a relatively low average despite the rise in price. This suggests that experienced holders are not offloading their positions, but instead continuing to hold through the rally. With long-term holders largely inactive and momentum accelerating, Bitcoin appears to be entering a decisive phase. As macroeconomic conditions remain favorable for risk assets, and with institutional demand rising, all eyes are now on how BTC behaves at these new highs‚Äîand whether the rest of the crypto market will follow its lead. Bitcoin Prepares For A Massive Surge Bitcoin continues to trade above key psychological and technical levels, signaling that the market is entering an expansion phase with the potential for a massive surge. After clearing its previous all-time high and consolidating around $117,000, Bitcoin‚Äôs structure looks increasingly bullish. Analysts and traders are closely watching on-chain indicators to confirm whether long-term holders are beginning to exit, but so far, the data suggests they are not. Top analyst Darkfost shared relevant insights regarding the Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric, a key tool used to assess long-term holder activity. CDD calculates how long a Bitcoin stays unmoved before a transfer, revealing long-term participants‚Äô behavior. Recently, the metric saw a sharp spike, raising initial concerns about possible distribution. However, it was later confirmed that the move involved 80,000 BTC in an internal transfer ‚Äî no actual selling occurred. Since that event, the CDD has returned to its previous low range, especially when compared to Bitcoin‚Äôs soaring price. This signals that long-term holders are still sitting tight, showing no urgency to sell into strength. Their conviction reflects growing expectations of higher prices ahead, supported by macro conditions, increasing adoption, and rising institutional interest. With strong hands holding firm and momentum building, Bitcoin appears poised for continuation. As long as key support levels are maintained and long-term holders remain inactive, the setup favors an explosive move that could redefine price discovery in this cycle. Related Reading: Crypto Founder Pushes Ethereum As ‚ÄòWorld Reserve Asset‚Äô ‚Äì Details Price Discovery Kicks In: Momentum Accelerates Bitcoin‚Äôs three‚Äëday chart shows a textbook breakout from eight weeks of compression. Thursday‚Äôs candle closed firmly above the former record cluster at‚ÄØ$109,300, opening the door for a vertical push that carried price to $118,800 on the very next print. The candle body towers well above the 50‚Äëperiod SMA, while the 100‚Äë and 200‚Äëperiod averages slope higher beneath, confirming a bullish long‚Äëterm structure. The old resistance band between $105,000 and $109,300 now flips into first demand; any orderly retest that wicks into that zone would likely attract sidelined buyers. Below it, $103,600‚Äîthe mid‚Äërange support that capped drawdowns all spring‚Äîremains the line in the sand for the current trend. Related Reading: Ethereum Targets Liquidity Above $3,000 ‚Äì Price Magnet Forming Upside projections derive from the height of the year‚Äëlong range (~$15‚ÄØk). Adding that measure to the breakout point targets $124‚Äì125‚ÄØk as the next logical objective, with the psychological $120‚ÄØk round number a potential interim stall area. Momentum oscillators on medium time‚Äëframes are stretched but not at extreme levels, suggesting room for continuation before a cooling period becomes necessary.

2025-07-13T05:51:50,"Retail Investors Sit Out Bitcoin Rally as Institutions Drive ETF Surge","Despite Bitcoin hitting new all-time highs last week, retail investors have been notably absent from the action, according to market analysts. Meanwhile, institutional interest has surged, particularly in the form of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which saw more than $1 billion in inflows on both Thursday and Friday ‚Äî a back-to-back milestone never previously achieved. Institutional Surge Behind Latest Price Move Bitwise head of research Andr√© Dragosch observed in a Friday post that although Bitcoin is soaring, mainstream interest has yet to catch up. ‚ÄúBitcoin is at new all-time highs but retail is almost nowhere to be found,‚Äù he wrote, referencing data showing weak Google search trends for the term ‚ÄúBitcoin.‚Äù This suggests the current rally is primarily fueled by institutions, not individual investors. Search Trends Fail to Reflect Price Surge Google Trends data supports this narrative. Between June 29‚ÄìJuly 5 and July 6‚Äì12, global searches for ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äù increased by just 8%, even as Bitcoin‚Äôs price broke past its previous all-time high of $111,970 and continued climbing to $118,780 by Friday. This subdued retail interest contrasts sharply with the surge seen in November 2024, when search interest peaked following Donald Trump‚Äôs election win. At that time, retail engagement helped propel Bitcoin past the $100,000 mark for the first time. Retail Sentiment: ‚ÄúMissed the Boat‚Äù Some crypto commentators believe that retail investors are sitting out because they feel priced out of the market. ‚ÄúI think a lot of retail folks find out the price of one Bitcoin is 117k and think, nahhh I missed the boat and don‚Äôt even give it a second thought,‚Äù said Bitcoin analyst Lindsay Stamp. Cedric Youngelman, host of the Bitcoin Matrix podcast, shared a similar sentiment, asking his followers, ‚ÄúAt what Bitcoin price do you think retail wakes up? I‚Äôll go first. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre coming for a long time.‚Äù Analysts Say Rally Still Has Momentum Despite low retail participation, market experts believe the current rally has more room to run. Bitcoin on-chain analyst Willy Woo commented, ‚ÄúThis run has plenty of legs left in it.‚Äù The continued interest from institutional players suggests that Bitcoin‚Äôs momentum is far from over. Spot ETFs Remain the Main Driver Spot Bitcoin ETFs had an exceptionally strong week, pulling in a total of $2.72 billion over five trading days, according to Farside data. This wave of capital suggests institutional demand remains robust. However, the trend has raised questions about how to measure actual retail interest in the current market landscape. Cointelegraph recently noted that if the ultimate holders of Bitcoin ETF shares are retail investors, then interpreting on-chain data could become more complex. Conclusion While Bitcoin continues to scale new heights, the retail crowd appears hesitant to reenter the market. Whether due to price anxiety or market fatigue, their absence is notable ‚Äî especially in contrast to the flood of institutional capital pouring into ETFs. As the rally unfolds, attention now turns to whether retail investors will follow ‚Äî or continue to watch from the sidelines.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/retail-investors-sit-out-bitcoin-rally-as-institutions-drive-etf-surge/,"BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET|RESEARCH","Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence",cryptocompare
