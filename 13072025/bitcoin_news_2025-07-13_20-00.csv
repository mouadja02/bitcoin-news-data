2025-07-13T17:57:20,"AI predicts XLM price for July 31 after 85% spike","Stellar ( XLM ) is breaking out alongside the broader cryptocurrency market , with an artificial intelligence (AI) model forecasting a potential push past the $0.50 resistance level by the end of July. As of press time, XLM was trading at $0.46, up 20% in the past 24 hours and 86% over the last week. XLM one-week price chart. Source: Finbold Amid the rally, Finbold consulted OpenAI’s ChatGPT model, which outlined several possible price scenarios for the cross-border payment token. In a bullish case, driven by continued market strength or positive project developments, XLM could climb to between $0.55 and $0.62. A neutral scenario might see the price consolidate between $0.42 and $0.48, potentially retesting the support level. However, ChatGPT noted that if momentum fades due to a Bitcoin ( BTC ) cooldown or profit-taking, XLM could retreat to the $0.35 and $0.40 range. The AI model’s base case assumes Bitcoin remains above the $115,000 to $119,000 range and that altcoin sentiment stays strong. Under these conditions, XLM could reach $0.55 to $0.58 by the end of the month. If Bitcoin’s dominance rises or investor risk appetite weakens, XLM may struggle to maintain its current levels and drop toward $0.40. Technically, the AI model noted that support lies between $0.35 and $0.38, a zone that previously acted as resistance. On the upside, $0.50 remains a key psychological barrier, with further resistance at $0.60 to $0.65 levels last seen in early 2022. ChatGPT XLM price prediction for July 31. Source: ChatGPT Drivers of XLM rally Overall, XLM’s ongoing strength has been fueled by Bitcoin’s record-breaking surge above $119,000 and renewed interest in altcoins. Beyond the broader rally, a key catalyst was PayPal’s announcement to integrate its stablecoin PYUSD on the Stellar network, pending regulatory approval. The July 11 announcement triggered a 20.5% intraday volatility spike, pushing XLM from $0.345 to $0.416 as traders priced in future demand and liquidity. Despite the bullish momentum, the AI model cautions that XLM’s sharp 86% weekly gain could prompt a short-term correction if not supported by strong fundamentals and sustained volume.

2025-07-13T17:12:53,"Expert Says XRP Is Peeking Out of the Bull Flag. Here’s the Significance","XRP is once again commanding attention as it flashes a powerful bullish signal on the 4-hour chart. Prominent analyst XRPunkie pointed out that XRP is “peeking out of the bull flag”—a classic continuation pattern often seen just before a major upward move. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.83, marking a significant push higher after a brief period of consolidation. Bull Flag Breakout Suggests a Strong Continuation The bull flag is one of the most reliable chart patterns in technical analysis. It forms when an asset rallies sharply, then enters a downward-sloping consolidation range, creating the “flag”, before breaking out in the direction of the initial trend. XRP has followed this exact structure. After surging from below $2.50 earlier this month, the price entered a tight flag pattern. Now, as XRP breaks above the upper boundary of this flag around $2.78, momentum is clearly shifting back in favor of the bulls. Ooooooo……. $XRP on the 4hourly candle is peeking out of the bull flag…. pic.twitter.com/nOZtrHWqyq — XRPunkie (@Shawnmark7899) July 13, 2025 This breakout is more than just a technical nuance, it reflects growing market strength. As noted by XRPunkie, the breakout signals that buyers are stepping back in, likely setting the stage for another leg up. If momentum continues, XRP could soon retest the upper resistance zone between $2.90 and $3.00. Key Levels to Watch XRP’s climb from below $2.50 to its current price of $2.83 represents a rally of more than 13% in under two weeks. This latest breakout places XRP in a critical zone. The immediate resistance lies near $2.90, followed by the psychologically important $3.00 mark. A strong close above $3.00 could open the door to a longer-term breakout and much higher targets. On the downside, the $2.78 level, where the flag breakout occurred—now acts as near-term support. If XRP remains above this level, it would further validate the bullish setup. However, if the price slips back below $2.70, it could signal a failed breakout and further consolidation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Conditions Support the Rally XRP’s breakout isn’t happening in isolation. The broader crypto market is flashing strength, with Bitcoin trading above $118,000 and altcoins showing renewed momentum. XRP’s bullish structure is also backed by positive fundamentals. Whale accumulation is growing, exchange balances are dropping, and wallet activity is on the rise , all pointing to increased demand and long-term holding. Additionally, excitement is building around the upcoming ProShares XRP Futures ETF, which is scheduled to launch on July 18. This development could drive further institutional interest, adding fuel to XRP’s recent rally. XRP’s breakout from the bull flag pattern is a strong technical signal that the uptrend is likely to continue. As emphasized by XRPunkie, the move out of consolidation marks a turning point for XRP on the lower timeframes. With the price now holding at $2.83 and momentum building, all eyes are on the key resistance zone between $2.90 and $3.00. If this level is cleared, XRP could be on the verge of a major breakout, one that finally propels it beyond the shadow of past highs and into a new bullish phase.

Cuban national Michel Duarte Suarez has pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and mail fraud and one count of aggravated identity theft after stealing about $803,000 from his victim’s bank account over a four-month period. Court documents show that Suarez told a confidential informant in March 2022 that he had access to the account of an 82-year-old victim. While living in Panama at the time, the scammer wrote and sent checks to South Florida with instructions to his co-conspirators to encash the checks and wire 50% of the funds to Suarez’s Miami-based firm, Online Electronics. Authorities say that Suarez forged the checks to resemble the signature of the victim displayed on their signature card for the same bank account. Suarez was arrested in January 2025 in Panama and was extradited to South Florida to face the charges. For his crimes, he could spend 30 years behind bars plus a mandatory consecutive two-year sentence to any imprisonment term handed down by a judge. The fraudster is slated for sentencing on September 29th, 2025, in Miami before United States District Court Judge Kathleen M. Williams.

2025-07-13T16:23:28,"Bitcoin Breaks $119, While XLM and HBAR Lead Altcoin Rally","According to CoinDesk Data price information , at 2:20 p.m. UTC on Sunday, the bitcoin (BTC) price set a new all-time high of $119, 308, up 1.4% in the past 24-hour period. Bitcoin's achievement was a little bit surprising because the crypto market was waiting for the U.S. stock market to open on Monday to discover the reaction to the 30% tariffs against imports from the EU and Mexico that Trump announced late Friday on Truth Social. Analysts expect the bitcoin price to reach as high as $250,000 by year-end. For example, in a recent interview on CNBC, Fundstrat Capital CIO Thomas Lee said that the demand versus supply imbalance for BTC meant that its price could easily reach anywhere from $150,000 to $250,000 by the end of this year. As of 4:11 p.m. UTC, bitcoin is trading at around $118,882, which is a gain of 1.38% in the past 24-hour period. Meanwhile, on the same day, XLM got as high $0.4815 (at 3:20 p.m. UTC), but currently it is trading at $0.4578, up 22% in the past 24 hours. XLM's performance, although highly impressive, was not a huge shock since on Saturday, it surged 6% to $0.3880, making it the top performer by percent change among the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap. As for HBAR, its intraday high of $0.2516 was reached at 3:10 p.m. UTC, but it is currently trading at around $0.2439, up 27% in the past 24 hours, which makes it right now today's top percentage gainer among the top 20 cryptocurrencies. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital noted on X that HBAR’s recent 62% surge aligns closely with its 2021 price cycle, suggesting the token could be setting up for a similar breakout pattern. According to the analyst, HBAR has been tracking the 2021 structure ""almost perfectly,"" and any near-term pullback should be viewed as a potential retest with the goal of breaking above the current lower high resistance level. The pseudonymous analyst also pointed out that a modest 2.5% dip in bitcoin’s market dominance has already fueled strong rallies across many altcoins. He noted that if such a small decline can trigger outsized altcoin moves, a more substantial drop in dominance — into double-digit territory —could significantly accelerate capital rotation into the altcoin market.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/13/bitcoin-breaks-usd119k-but-xlm-and-hbar-aren-t-impressed-by-its-meager-percentage-gain,"BTC|TRADING|XLM|ALTCOIN|HBAR","Markets|Bitcoin|btc|XLM|hbar|News",cryptocompare

Total cryptocurrency liquidation. Source: Coinglass The liquidations were driven by a short squeeze, as Bitcoin’s breakout above key resistance levels forced short sellers to cover their positions. High leverage on platforms like Binance and Bybit amplified the losses, with even minor price moves wiping out positions. What next for Bitcoin Currently, the market remains uncertain about Bitcoin’s next move, with some analysts predicting a potential retracement near its current highs. For instance, pseudonymous cryptocurrency analyst Niels noted in a July 13 X post that the long-term Power Law Analysis chart identifies the $119,000 to $120,000 zone as a critical resistance level. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: Alpractal He shared a chart, plotted on a log-log scale, that tracks Bitcoin’s historical price action against power law trendlines that have shaped its long-term growth trajectory. Currently, BTC is testing a cluster of upper trendlines, signaling strong resistance overhead. A breakout above the $120,000 level could open the door to further gains, targeting the $135,000 and $140,000 range, which aligns with the next set of power law bands. Conversely, a rejection at this level could lead to a short-term pullback to the $114,000 and $115,000 zone, which aligns with mid-range support. Such a move would remain within the broader long-term bullish framework outlined in the chart.

As per the update from the Memorandum of Understanding MoU, Animoca will allocate $100 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC) to DDC for management. Strategic Expansion of Bitcoin Treasury Adoption Notably, DDC will manage Animoca’s Bitcoin holding while generating yield from its reserves. The development is a significant event in institutional adoption and Bitcoin treasury management. It adds to the growing trend of traditional companies embracing Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and a preferred store of value. Interestingly, in May, DDC signaled it was embracing the Bitcoin treasury route with plans to accumulate 5,000 BTC over the next three years. After the announcement, DDC made an initial 21 BTC purchase as it began its quest to protect its assets amid global financial uncertainty. Under the management deal with Animoca, Yat Siu, the co-founder and Executive Chairman, will join DCC’s Bitcoin Visionary Council. Siu will be there to provide both leadership and steer the Bitcoin treasury operations. The goal is to ensure that the budding firm aligns with standards obtainable in the sector. Crypto Finance Meets Traditional Industries Speaking on the development, Norma Chu, founder and CEO of DCC, maintained that Siu’s addition to the team at Bitcoin Visionary Council was invaluable. She stated that Siu’s excellent experience will ensure strategic decisions on the BTC initiative. Chu emphasized that together, they hope to build a disciplined risk management system that would ensure they maximize Bitcoin’s full potential as a contemporary asset of value. This marks another bold partnership in the crypto sector. In the first quarter of 2025, Animoca Brands also partnered with Standard Chartered Bank, Hong Kong. The move saw the duo launch a Hong Kong dollar-backed stablecoin . Animoca Considers U.S. Public Listing Meanwhile , Animoca Brands is considering a public listing in the U.S . given the shift in regulatory climate after President Donald Trump assumed office for a second term. Siu says the decision to launch an IPO is strategic as there appear to be fewer regulatory obstacles to deal with. The broader crypto community remains keen on seeing how the partnership turns out. It will also be interesting to see how the Bitcoin accumulation progresses amid the rising value of the digital asset.

Bitcoin, which has risen around 21% since the beginning of 2025, has also been supported by the Trump administration's crypto-friendly policies, including the creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve and the expansion of digital asset holdings. Pepperstone research strategist Dilin Wu stated that the underlying reason for this rally is the ongoing structural inflows from institutional investors. Wu also emphasized that companies continue to accumulate Bitcoin, noting that firms like MicroStrategy (MSTR) and GameStop (GME) are adding BTC to their balance sheets.

2025-07-13T15:30:14,"Bitcoin Boom Pushes Satoshi Nakamoto Into Top 11 Wealthiest, At $130  Billion","Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous creator of Bitcoin , ranks as the 11th richest person on earth if you count his unspent coins as a liquid fortune. He holds about 1.096 million BTC, which works out to roughly $129 billion based on figures from Arkham Intelligence . That would edge him just ahead of Michael Dell’s $125 billion and leave him trailing Sergey Brin’s $140 billion. Satoshi’s Fortune In Figures According to Arkham Intelligence, those 1.096 million BTC have not moved since they were mined in Bitcoin’s early days. At today’s price, they sit at about $129.23 billion. For context, that sum would slot Satoshi above Dell and below Brin on a real‑time billionaire list. That list doesn’t officially include Satoshi, but plugging his holdings into Forbes’s tracker paints a clear picture of where he’d fall. Bitcoin’s price has hovered near $118,000 in recent sessions. If it stays there, Satoshi’s stake remains paper wealth—there’s no sign he plans to sell. Oiling those coins into the market could crash prices, so his fortune may stay stuck at the top of a ledger rather than in a bank. Price Target At $400,000 Based on reports from an anonymous trader known as apsk32, Bitcoin could climb to $400,000. That call comes from a three‑plot model comparing Bitcoin’s market cap to gold’s history. Gold once peaked at $3,500 an ounce, and apsk32 argues Bitcoin follows a similar pattern when you measure both in units of gold. The first plot in the model traces gold’s price per ounce over time. The second shows Bitcoin’s market cap plotted against those gold‑based values. A straight trend line emerges, which apsk32 ties to Metcalfe’s Law—a theory that network value grows roughly with the square of its users. The third plot is a log chart, similar to Bitcoin’s well‑known Rainbow chart, but it layers on “years‑ahead” support bands from zero to five years ahead of the implied price line. Model And Market Caveats According to that framework, Bitcoin has never pierced the five‑years‑ahead band, even in past bubbles. Right now, the one‑year‑ahead line sits near $400,000. If history holds, BTC could respect that band as a ceiling or floor, depending on market mood and macro factors like Federal Reserve policy or global demand. Even if Bitcoin did hit $400,000, that jump represents more than a 200 % rise from today’s levels. Forecasts are guesses dressed up in charts.

2025-07-13T14:59:03,"Best Currency Exchange in Mississauga: Rates & Top Picks","I got ripped off exchanging currency at Toronto Pearson last month. $500 USD turned into $580 CAD. Should've been $640. Never again. So I went on a mission. Visited every currency exchange in Mississauga. Compared exchange rates. Timed the waits. Asked the dumb questions. Here's what I found. The Winner Is Obvious ChicksX destroys the competition. Not even close. They're the only place doing both regular currency exchange AND crypto. Need to exchange money from USD to CAD? Done. Want to throw some into Bitcoin? Also done. Their exchange rate? Best I found. Their foreign exchange rates beat banks by 3-5%. But here's the kicker: they're open 8 AM to 10 PM. Every. Single. Day. Quick Currency Exchange Comparison Before I dive into the full list, here's how the top currency exchange services stack up: Feature ChicksX Money Exchange World MONEY MONEY Banks Airport Exchange Rate Best rates Good Good Bad Terrible Hours 8 AM-10 PM daily 10 AM-7 PM (M-F) 10 AM-5 PM (M-SAT) 9 AM-5 PM 24/7 Foreign Currencies Available 200+ 50+ 40+ 20+ Limited Crypto Exchange Yes No No No No Wait Time 5-10 min 10-15 min 15-20 min 30-45 min 5 min Online Currency Options Yes Limited No Yes No Money Transfers Yes Yes (Western Union) Yes Yes No Large Transaction Support Yes Yes Yes Sometimes No Best Currency Exchange Services in Mississauga 1. ChicksX - The Clear Winner Location: 2275 Britannia Rd W Unit # 3, Mississauga, ON L5M 2G6, Canada ChicksX is the best currency exchange in Mississauga and it's not even a debate. Why? They give you the mid-market exchange rate minus a tiny fee. Banks? They hide their profit in terrible rates. I exchanged $1,000 USD here. Got $1,340 CAD. Bank of Montreal offered me $1,295. That's $45 saved. Plus they handle foreign currencies nobody else touches. Malaysian Ringgit? Yep. Random crypto? Also yep. Their currency exchange service works both ways too. Need to convert CAD back to USD before heading to the states? They'll buy it back at decent rates. 2. Money Exchange World Location: 700 Burnhamthorpe Rd W #4 Solid for regular currency exchange Mississauga needs. They do money transfers through Western Union if you need to send money abroad. Exchange rates are fair. Not amazing. But fair. They handle most major foreign currencies. Euro, pound, yen: the usual suspects. 3. MONEY MONEY Exchange Location: 3355 Hurontario St #3 These guys specialize in large transactions. International students use them for tuition. Business owners for imports. Their foreign exchange rates get better with bigger amounts. Exchange $100? Meh. Exchange $10,000? Now we're talking. 4. Currency Exchange Xpert Location: 4099 Erin Mills Pkwy Perfect 5-star rating but only 16 reviews. Take that how you will. They offer competitive rates but nothing special. Good if you're already in the area. Why Not Banks or Airport Currency Exchange? Airport Exchange (Toronto Pearson) Only if you hate money. Their exchange rate includes a 10-15% markup. That $100 USD? You'll get maybe $120 CAD. Should be $134. Your Local Bank Banks make money on terrible foreign exchange rates. They'll tell you there's no fee. Lie. The fee is hidden in the rate. You're paying 3-5% extra every time. Plus the wait. And the paperwork. And them treating you like you're asking for their firstborn. How Currency Exchange Actually Works It's stupid simple: Check the mid-market rate online Call for a quote on your currency exchange rates Bring ID and cash Get your receipt Walk out with new currency Some places let you order foreign currency online. ChicksX has online currency exchange options. Book ahead, lock in rates. For transfers over $3,000, most places need advance notice. They don't keep $50,000 in Thai Baht lying around. Exchange Rates Change - Here's What Matters The exchange rate for your currency moves every second. But here's what actually matters: Mid-market exchange rate: What banks trade at. Your benchmark. Retail rate: What you get. Should be within 1-2% of mid-market. Airport/hotel rate: 10-15% markup. Avoid. I check rates on my phone before going. Takes 2 seconds. Saves real money. Foreign Currencies Available Most places in Mississauga handle the basics: USD (US dollars) EUR (Euro) GBP (British Pound) CAD (if you're exchanging out) But if you need: Chinese Yuan Filipino Peso Malaysian Ringgit Indian Rupee Call first. Not everyone stocks these. ChicksX has 200+ currencies. Never seen them not have something. Tips From Someone Who's Been Burned Never exchange at hotels. Ever. Their rates are worse than airports. ATMs abroad? Your debit card charges 3-5% plus ATM fees. Adds up fast. Credit cards? They'll say ""pay in your home currency"" at shops. Don't. That's a 4% markup. Pay in local currency. Get the best exchange by comparing 2-3 places. Takes 10 minutes. Saves 3-5%. Travel money? Exchange 70% here, keep 30% for emergencies. Diversify. When You're Visiting Canada Need CAD? Don't wait till you land at Toronto airport. Foreign exchange in Mississauga gives way better deals. Especially if you're staying in the GTA. The best currency exchange rates are always away from tourist spots. Shocking, right? Safety Stuff Nobody Talks About Good currency exchange services give proper receipts. Keep them. They verify ID. That's good. Means they're legit. Your transaction gets recorded. If something goes wrong, there's a paper trail. Money transfers especially, always get confirmation. Email, text, whatever. Bottom Line on Currency Exchange Mississauga Stop getting screwed by banks and airports. Find a real foreign currency exchange. Compare rates. Save money. I use ChicksX because they've got the best rates, longest hours, and handle both regular and crypto exchange. But even using the second-best place beats banks by miles. Your money. Your choice. Just stop throwing it away on garbage exchange rates. And seriously, that airport currency exchange? Only in emergencies. And I mean real emergencies.

The latest price surge came after Strategy’s former CEO hinted about another purchase, while the author of Rich Dad, Poor Dad said he is going to buy more asap. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView The new peak came minutes ago when BTC jumped to the aforementioned level of $119,400 after slipping back down to $117,000 yesterday. Today’s surge seems somewhat unexpected, at least when viewed from a macroeconomic point of view. After all, the US imposed a new set of tariffs against the EU and Mexico yesterday, at a rate of 30%. Similar instances in the past resulted in price declines, not new peaks. However, bitcoin seems immune to Trump’s global policy at the moment. The cryptocurrency added more than $11,000 since Wednesday, when it stood calmly at $108,000. In the following days, the asset broke into uncharted territory on multiple occasions, including the Friday peak of almost $119,000. You can check some of the possible reasons behind this impressive conclusion of the entire week here . Earlier today, Michael Saylor, the co-founder and bitcoin champion of Startegy, hinted that the company had made another purchase recently after failing to announce a new buy last Monday (which is a rare occasion).

JPMorgan Chase has informed fintech companies such as PayPal, Venmo and Coinbase that they will need to begin paying to access their customers’ bank account information, Bloomberg reports . The companies use the information to make it easier for their customers to send, receive and trade money. JPMorgan is reportedly poised to collect hundreds of millions of dollars in fees for the service. A spokesperson for the bank told Bloomberg that JPMorgan has invested a significant amount of resources in creating a secure system that protects consumer data. “We’ve had productive conversations and are working with the entire ecosystem to ensure we’re all making the necessary investments in the infrastructure that keeps our customers safe.” In his annual letter to shareholders, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon touched on the issue, saying that more guardrails needed to be in place if companies were to continue accessing the banks’ client data. “Third parties want full access to banks’ customer data so they can exploit it for their own purposes and profits. Contrary to what you may read, we have no problem with data sharing but only if it is done properly: It must be authorized by the customer – the customer should know exactly what data is shared and when and how it is used; third parties should pay for accessing the banking system and payment rails; third parties should be restricted from using the customers’ data for purposes beyond what the customer authorized, and they should be liable for the risks they create when accessing and using that data. When banks utilize third-party data, they will be, and in most cases already are, subject to these same obligations. Banks provide fantastic services, and it’s time to defend ourselves – in the public realm or in court if need be.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-13T14:22:08,"Czech central bank adds Coinbase to its portfolio","The Czech National Bank (CNB) has arrived on the crypto scene according to its latest U.S. regulatory filing. The central bank of the European nation added a new position in Coinbase during the second quarter of 2025, marking a rare publicly recorded exposure to a crypto-related equity. The move came alongside an increase in the CNB’s existing stake in Palantir. It reflects a growing appetite for high-growth, high-volatility U.S. tech stocks among institutional allocators. Czech central bank adds Coinbase to its portfolio The Czech central bank’s latest investment was disclosed in a Form 13F filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It revealed that it purchased 51,732 shares of Coinbase Global. At the time of the filing, those shares were worth over $18 million. Coinbase has had a strong 2025 so far. Its stock rose more than 40% in the first half of the year, riding a wave of renewed institutional interest in digital assets and increased regulatory clarity in the U.S. that started with the long-awaited approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2024. Coinbase stock chart. Source: Google Finance The central bank’s filing also showed an additional 49,135 shares purchased in Palantir, a software and artificial intelligence company with ties to the U.S. military, bringing its total holdings to 519,950 shares. The CNB’s move appears to be rooted in passive index-tracking strategies rather than speculative intent. Coinbase joined the S&P 500 in May 2025, and Palantir debuted on the index in September 2024. Palantir and Coinbase are market up-and-comers Central banks usually invest in highly liquid, dollar-denominated securities to diversify reserves and maintain returns in line with benchmark indices. In this case, the CNB’s purchase of Coinbase may be less about a bold bet on crypto and more about staying aligned with the U.S. stock market makeup. Spotting Palantir and Coinbase in the CNB’s portfolio adds to the growing institutional appetite for disruptive tech sectors. Palantir has been a favorite among AI-focused investors looking to reap gains from its data analytics and government contracts. Its PLTR stock rose 80% in the first half of 2025, far outpacing the S&P 500’s modest 5.5% return during the same period. Coinbase has maintained a strong institutional profile. Since its addition to the S&P 500, the company has benefited from increased ETF adoption, new exchange-traded products, and a sharp uptick in spot trading volume across Bitcoin and Ethereum markets. The CNB’s timing may prove fortunate, as Coinbase has added roughly 10% more in Q3.

Key Takeaways: James Wynn deleted his X account after suffering nine-figure losses from risky, high-leverage crypto trades. His Bitcoin positions on Hyperliquid were liquidated multiple times, wiping out nearly all his holdings. Wynn’s dramatic downfall serves as a warning against aggressive speculation in volatile markets. His former handle, “ JamesWynnReal ,” now leads to a message stating, “This account doesn’t exist. Try searching for another.” According to blockchain data aggregated by Arkham Intelligence and Hypurrscan, Wynn’s wallets currently hold just over $10,000, a dramatic fall from his previous positions. James Wynn Changes Bio to ‘Broke’ Before Deleting Account Prior to deleting his account, Wynn updated his profile bio to a single word: “broke.” Wynn earned notoriety within crypto circles for consistently taking high-risk, high-leverage positions that often ran counter to market trends. His aggressive trading style led to losses totaling hundreds of millions. He gained particular attention for his activity on the Hyperliquid platform, where he placed some of his biggest bets. In May 2025, Wynn’s $100 million long position on Bitcoin was liquidated after the price slipped below $105,000. The wipeout resulted in the loss of 949 BTC from his holdings. Just before this collapse, Wynn admitted publicly that his approach resembled gambling more than disciplined trading, warning others not to follow his risky strategy. Despite this setback, Wynn opened another $100 million Bitcoin position days later. He claimed his positions were under attack by market makers aiming to trigger his liquidation. In a rare plea, Wynn requested donations from the crypto community to bolster his account, receiving funds from at least 24 addresses. Shortly after, Wynn liquidated 240 BTC, valued at around $25 million then, in an attempt to reduce his liquidation risk. He made $100,000,000 in unrealized profit. Lost everything. Begged for donations to avoid liquidation. Today his account got suspended. The downfall of James Wynn (1/9) pic.twitter.com/lMFKIiuc1V — StarPlatinum (@StarPlatinumSOL) July 12, 2025 Nevertheless, his efforts failed to save the remaining positions, which lost over 99% of their value. Wynn’s downfall has sparked debate among crypto investors, with many pointing to his losses as a cautionary tale. Wynn first rose to prominence by turning a $7,000 position in PEPE into $25 million. In March, Wynn began trading perpetual futures for the first time and quickly transformed a $3 million position into $100 million through aggressive high-leverage plays. Hyperliquid Hits $248 Billion Monthly Volume In May, Hyperliquid surged to a record $248 billion in trading volume, marking a 51.5% increase from April’s $187.5 billion. The growth came amid heightened market activity during the “James Wynn” trading frenzy. Year-over-year, Hyperliquid’s volume soared by 843%, jumping from $26.3 billion last May to this year’s record-breaking figure. The platform combines centralized exchange (CEX)-level user experience with non-custodial onchain infrastructure, attracting traders who want both performance and crypto-native operations. Hyperliquid’s expanding footprint is evident in its growing market share relative to Binance, the industry giant. In May, Hyperliquid accounted for 10.54% of Binance’s perpetual futures volume, up from 9.76% in April, signaling a shift in dominance within the sector. Decentralized exchange (DEX) perpetual futures also saw gains, capturing 6.84% of global perp flows in May, a rise from under 2% in 2022.

2025-07-13T13:30:21,"Bitcoin Price Outlook for 2025: $250,000 Possible While Ozak AI Remains the Talk of Presale Markets","Optimism is rising within the crypto market—particularly in terms of the two ends of the spectrum: Bitcoin, the project blue-chip asset, and Ozak AI , a rising presale-level token generating extreme buzz. While Bitcoin bulls eye a potential surge to $250,000 subsidized by means of growing institutional adoption and international macro traits, Ozak AI keeps to benefit traction as one of the maximum discussed early-stage altcoins with its integration of artificial intelligence and decentralized records infrastructure. Bitcoin Targeting a $250K Breakout Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading above $117,000 and stays the undisputed leader of the crypto market. With the following bull cycle underway and broader popularity of BTC as a digital store of value, many analysts believe a target of $250,000 in 2025 is within reach. Factors just like the current Bitcoin ETF approvals, growing company holdings, and growing interest from institutional buyers have drastically boosted demand. The key to Bitcoin’s boom lies in its growing legitimacy amongst traditional finance players. Major asset managers now maintain exposure to BTC, and a few governments are even exploring Bitcoin-based total funding strategies. While it is able to no longer supply the equal exponential gains as smaller-cap altcoins, Bitcoin gives a level of security and predictability that many buyers nonetheless find attractive—particularly those with large portfolios searching for hedge-like belongings at some stage in financial uncertainty. Ozak AI: The $0.005 Token Targeting $1 While Bitcoin sets its sights on a potential 2x to 3x return, Ozak AI is capturing attention with its far more ambitious projection: a 200x move from its current presale price of $0.005 to $1. What sets Ozak AI apart from many other presale tokens is its real-world use case. Built around predictive AI, decentralized data vaults, and scalable infrastructure, Ozak AI is creating a platform for advanced data analytics tailored to financial markets. Its ecosystem includes the Ozak Stream Network (OSN) for real-time data flow, Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) for secure processing, and highly customizable AI agents that users can train to fit specific data analysis needs. As more institutions and traders look for competitive AI tools to enhance their decision-making, Ozak AI aims to fill that gap, offering a utility that could generate sustainable demand over time. The project has already raised over $1.3 million and is currently in Stage 4 of its presale, with growing community support and early listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. With such a low entry point, even modest adoption could push Ozak AI toward its $1 target in the coming cycle. Bitcoin and Ozak AI represent two very different investment strategies going into 2025. Bitcoin may appeal to those looking for a relatively safer store of value with a high ceiling, while Ozak AI is designed for high-risk, high-reward investors betting on disruptive innovation in the AI and crypto space. If Bitcoin does reach $250,000, it will solidify its status as a long-term global asset. But if Ozak AI hits $1, it could become one of the most legendary ROI stories of this bull run. About Ozak AI Ozak AI is a blockchain-based crypto task that provides an innovative platform that focuses on predictive AI and advanced data analytics for financial markets. Through machine learning algorithms and decentralized community technologies, Ozak AI enables real-time, accurate, and actionable insights to help crypto lovers and corporations make the perfect choices.

2025-07-13T13:24:23,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Steady Around $118,000 As Rally Takes A Breather","Bitcoin (BTC) looks to be taking a bit of a breather as its rally paused over the weekend. The flagship cryptocurrency’s unprecedented rally sent it to record levels, with the price peaking at $118,856 on Friday. BTC raced to a new all-time high on Friday and is marginally up over the past 24 hours, trading around $117,903. The price had dipped to a low of $117,101 early on Monday before recovering and moving to current levels. Bitcoin (BTC) Investors Look Ahead To Crucial Week Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto investors head into the week betting on a slew of crucial wins for the industry that could bring new investment and capital into the asset class. The US House of Representatives is set to debate several crypto bills that could provide the crypto industry with the regulatory framework it has demanded. President Trump has promised to support the crypto industry and urged lawmakers to draft favorable policies and rules for the sector. The President himself is involved in several crypto ventures, including World Liberty Financial, run by his sons Eric and Don Jr. Congress will vote on the GENIUS Act, the CLARITY Act, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, as the industry’s recently strained ties with Washington continue to thaw. Jag Kooner, head of derivatives at crypto exchange Bitfinex, stated, “Even if final passage stalls, the optics of legislative engagement are bullish.” Bitcoin’s rally triggered a broader uptick in the market, with several altcoins crossing key levels. Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, stated, “Investors are racing to take positions ahead of the extra publicity this event could attract.” Robert Kiyosaki Planning Another Bitcoin Buy Robert Kiyosaki, author of the best-selling Rich Dad Poor Dad, has reiterated one of his classic lessons about investor behavior and market timing, especially in terms of Bitcoin . Kiyosaki took to X to discuss investor psychology, stating, “Pigs get fat. Hogs get slaughtered. I state this lesson because I bought my latest bitcoin at $110K.” The best-selling author noted he was entering what investors call the “Banana Zone,” an explosive phase of upward price action driven by retail frenzy. The author contrasted the two types of market participants, stating, “Being a fat pig with enough bitcoin… I will wait for the coming hog slaughter. After the hogs stop squealing and selling and blaming bitcoin for their losses, my fellow pigs and I will buy more bitcoin on sale.” Kiyosaki is well-known for emphasizing long-term thinking and smart entry points when it comes to investing. The latest post emphasizes his philosophy that true gains come from patient and informed investing decisions. Retail Traders Missing Bitcoin (BTC) hit consecutive highs this week. However, retail investors are visibly absent, hesitant to jump back into the market. Despite this, demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs is surging, with Thursday and Friday recording inflows of over $1 billion, indicating that the rally is being driven by institutional investors. Bitwise head of research Andre Dragosch stated, “Bitcoin is at new all-time highs, but retail is almost nowhere to be found. Latest leg up is mostly driven by institutions.” Some market watchers speculate that retail investors believe they may have missed the boat and perceive the current price as too high to enter the market. Bitcoin commentator Lindsay Stamp stated, “I think a lot of retail folks find out the price of one Bitcoin is 117k and think, nahhh I missed the boat, and don’t even give it a second thought.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin’s (BTC) unprecedented rally has taken a breather over the weekend, as the price consolidates between $117,000 and $118,000. The flagship cryptocurrency set consecutive records this week, racing to a high of $116,393 on Thursday and $118,856 on Friday. The rally is part of a broader trend of investors embracing risk assets thanks to growing institutional interest and acceptance of digital assets like Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Inflows and market trends pushed BTC past $118,000, with over $1.4 billion in short positions liquidated. Major industry figures have predicted further upside, stability, and more institutional buying as Bitcoin treasury companies snap up the asset. Analysts expect bullish momentum to continue, with BTC continuing to push higher. Favorable macroeconomic developments next week could drive the price beyond $120,000. BTC registered a substantial increase on Wednesday (July 2), rising nearly 3% to $108,845. The price continued pushing higher on Thursday, reaching an intraday high of $110,583 before settling at $109,637. However, it was back in the red on Friday, dropping 1.41% to $108,097. BTC recovered over the weekend, registering a marginal increase on Saturday and then rising almost 1% on Sunday to settle at $109,231. Despite the positive weekend, BTC was back in the red on Monday, dropping nearly 1% to $108,273. Source: TradingView The price recovered on Tuesday, rising almost 1% to $108,942. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as BTC rose over 2% to cross $111,000 and settle at $111,255.

2025-07-13T13:15:00,"Bitcoin: Lightning Strikes Twice (Technical Analysis) (Rating Upgrade)","Summary Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, touching $119K as of July 11th, 2025. Congrats, Bitcoin! This milestone highlights Bitcoin's continued strength alongside the broader stock market rally. However, stocks were flat while BTC rallied 8% this week. I break down the 1 year and 1 month charts for BTC, including trends, support and resistance levels, and momentum and strength indicators. There are bearish signals in one chart and bullish signals in the other, confirming a pattern I am seeing form across high-beta and risk-on assets. I consider it very bullish. Consider not only if and at what price one should enter the trade, but also how — we have many tools available to use now in how to hold BTC. I discuss several options (including options). Introduction We are once again at a new historic moment for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). Alongside the stock market, BTC is reaching new highs, breaking $119,000 on July 11th, 2025, even if for just a moment. This marks Bitcoin's new all-time high, and rounds out a 25% gain YTD for BTC, and an even larger change from the bottom Bitcoin found in April. Data by YCharts This comes after a killer near 8% week, and a rally in Bitcoin that came on the heels of the passage of the Big Beautiful Bill from the week prior. Interestingly enough, this breakout from Bitcoin didn't follow US markets, which were flat over the same time. Actually, Bitcoin has been decoupling a lot lately, though it was still very correlated in the crash back in April. It has its moments. Data by YCharts The decoupling of Bitcoin from markets is a great sign, as it frees up Bitcoin to keep moving in its own direction in the coming weeks. Even if markets stay flat, or even fall, could Bitcoin keep this momentum up? Let's see what the charts say. Bitcoin Technical Analysis First, it should be of note that I've been seeing the same pattern in many charts lately , due to the correlation between high-beta assets. While Bitcoin can decouple from time to time, it overall has kept up with beta overall this past year. So I won't be talking about the inverse head and shoulders pattern I see, but you can read about that in the article linked above. I see it more in the Nasdaq 100 chart than I do here, anyway. Bitcoin didn't get the same volume boost at the breakout, but it did get the breakout. That's what brought us here, to our new all-time high. BTC One-Year Chart Here's the one-year chart I'm looking at, legend at the top of the image: Barchart There are a few things that stand out to me here: Trend since April low has been clearly upwards. Confirmed by higher highs and higher lows. Here is April-July in daily candles. Barchart We saw our first breakout in November, following the election hype. 200 EMA (maroon line) mostly held during March and April lows, indicating strong structural support around that level. Mid-June showed us the breakout cleanly above the psychological $100K barrier. Momentum gauges like RSI, MACD, and PPO are all bullish currently, showing some of the strongest momentum since Q4 2024. Barchart Here are the current support levels we can chart out: Level Type Note $119,000 Resistance Psychological, ATH $116,000 Support Last resistance $109,700 Support 20 EMA $105,500 Support 50 EMA $100,300 Strong Support 100 EMA $92,200 Strong Support 200 EMA This is a classic breakout happening, which is bullish, especially when confirmed with strong momentum and not-overbought conditions on the RSI (yet), MACD, and PPO. That being said, we could still see some short-term pullbacks, but I expected these levels to hold barring a large market correction that could bring down Bitcoin in sympathy. Otherwise, the chart says we may have $116,000, the last technical resistance that we broke out of to hit these new highs, as a new support level for midday trading noise. Traders looking to enter Bitcoin may consider looking around these various support levels, especially if we drop to the 100 EMA, around the $100K mark. That would be a psychological battle for price that could determine bullish or bearish sentiment moving forward. However, I don't expect us to test those levels soon, and certainly not without a negative catalyst. BTC One-Month Chart Looking back just at the past month shows us a different story, one that is far more exhausted than the one-year looks. This is where that ""short term pullback"" could come from. Barchart This is a consolidation pattern, which is common following a breakout, especially with a movement as forceful and strong as this last one was. See how fast the MACD and PPO lines jumped on July 10th-11th. That's one of the ways we can see the strength of a rally, although these indicators can tend to lag at times. Most of the movement that caused them to jump started on July 9th. Zoom in on the most recent ticks; remember that these are hour candles on a one-month chart. Note how we fell firmly below the 20 EMA, which is now acting as a resistance level. Next support is at the 50 EMA, which is down at $116,300. Barchart We could easily fall to $112,000 before resuming the upward trend, but it will depend on volume. Current volume hasn't changed much since the breakout, and if anything is a bit lower since then. Momentum indicators are bearish, and the RSI is reflecting close-to oversold conditions, but still has room to fall if consolidation continues. Barchart The positives about this chart is that it is showing us a very small bull flag around the consolidation, and this may be a textbook case of ""refueling,"" or buyer demand falling off after a breakout. That is usually a bullish signal to buy now, though I am hesitant to ever recommend buying anything at all-time highs. Bitcoin Investment Strategy For those holding BTC outright or through ETFs like IBIT, I would suggest continuing to hold. This may be a great opportunity, but I don't know if I add here. Personally, I am not adding to my position in Bitcoin because I am happy with my current allocation. This take doesn't mean I'm not bullish, and so I am still giving Bitcoin a buy rating here, but I just happened to have already bought (long) before I wrote this piece. I am right-sized currently, and suggest others consider their risk tolerance carefully, as Bitcoin is incredibly volatile. For those looking to buy in now, entry point matters. I would look for a pullback to the $110k-105k region, testing the 20 EMA and the 50 EMA. This may come on the back of the short-term weakness I see in the one-month chart, and I expect us to see increased intraday volatility as we test new highs. Those trading days will likely provide some solid entry points. For options traders, this breakout is likely to come with volatility, and we're already seeing IV push up. Long calls are risky due to currently high IV, as a prolonged pullback from here could deflate IV and crush options pricing. Short puts far OTM, with strikes below 100 EMA (~$100k or equivalent in ETF pricing) may be attractive, but cap upside participation if the breakout is sustained as I expect. For example, here is the IBIT Dec 31st 65C (a way cheaper way to buy options on Bitcoin). Notice the elevated implied volatility (purple line) relative to the inflated price, which we should expect either way since the underlying asset has run up to all-time highs. If IV falls back to where it was even just a few days ago, the call could rapidly lose value even if the asset stays at its current level. This phenomenon would be advantageous for options sellers, which is why I would recommend OTM short puts instead of long calls. OptionStrat How I Own BTC Personally, I don't own any actual Bitcoins anymore, as I got rid of most of the collection I had over the 2021 cycle when I felt like the bubble behavior had gotten too bad (NFTs, etc.), and the rest has become dust sitting across various wallets. It's no longer worth it to collect that, at least for now. I don't include that meaningfully in my Bitcoin allocation. Since the rise of access to derivatives and commodity-based ETFs over the last few years has changed the way people access BTC, I no longer feel the need to store them physically or with a custodian like Coinbase ( COIN ). I own them through my brokerage account now. I own Bitcoin two ways: The iShares IBIT ETF The Simplify MAXI ETF Income investors should also check out Roundhill's YBTC and NEOS' BTCI ; they're both great covered call funds covering BTC. Conclusion Ultimately, I see the possibility for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) to continue to impress, even after hitting a new all-time high on Friday. Risk-on assets are in vogue, and high beta instruments like Bitcoin are riding a generally positive wave. However, Bitcoin decoupled from stocks, which were flat last week, to run up almost 8% and set a new record. Technical analysis shows us a positive setup for Bitcoin, with the one-year chart looking far more bullish than the one-month chart. This falls in line with the general trend and pattern I am seeing, where BTC is consolidating after its breakout this past week. Consolidations may test new technical support levels, offering attractive entry points for bullish investors. I see the potential for more pain ahead, especially if stocks and other high-beta assets consolidate in the coming days, down to $110,000. However, there are several smaller barriers before then, and trading may be choppy through the summer. Long-term bullishness and short-term bearishness historically benefits buyers. Look out for opportunities, and be patient if necessary. Remember that position sizing is often more important than security selection.

2025-07-13T12:45:56,"Bank Insider Allegedly Obtains Customers’ Debit Card PINs, Drains $440,000 From Their Accounts in Just Two Months: DOJ","An associate banker at a large national bank is accused of stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars from customers in a span of just two months. According to the Northern District of California’s U.S. Attorney’s Office, Sixto Christopher Porras allegedly stole approximately $440,000 from two retail bank customers while stationed in San Francisco. In each of the cases, Porras managed to drain the bank accounts using the customer’s existing debit cards or replacements. The first incident occurred in August of 2023 after a customer walked into the bank to conduct a wire transfer, according to the Northern District of California’s U.S. Attorney’s Office. “As the transfer was processed, Porras obtained from the customer the security personal identification number associated with the customer’s debit card. Unbeknownst to the customer, Porras kept the customer’s debit card. Porras allegedly proceeded to use the debit card to embezzle approximately $100,000 from the customer’s account.” The second incident took place about a month later. “In or about September 2023, another retail bank customer visited the branch to address a fraudulent charge. As Porras assisted the customer, he obtained the security PIN associated with the customer’s debit card. Porras then caused the customer’s debit card to be reissued and sent to Porras’ San Francisco residence. Porras allegedly proceeded to use the debit card to embezzle approximately $340,000 from the customer’s accounts.” Porras, who currently no longer works with the unnamed bank, is now facing charges of embezzlement of bank funds and access device fraud. For the embezzlement charge, Porras could get a maximum of up to 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine if convicted. The access device fraud charge carries a maximum of 15 years in prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted.

This week’s most notable news is that Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, trading above $116,000, which has pushed El Salvador’s holdings to over $722 million, peaking at $726 million at one point. Argentina, on the other hand, continues to move forward with its plans to tokenise assets such as lithium reserves in San Juan, using the Cardano blockchain. El Salvador doubles down on Bitcoin amid new all-time high Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, trading above $116,000, which has pushed El Salvador’s holdings to over $722 million, peaking at $726 million at one point. Despite strong criticism from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which has urged the country to reduce its BTC purchases in exchange for a $1.4 billion loan agreement, El Salvador continues to expand its Bitcoin portfolio. Holding 6,234 BTC, the government sees the cryptocurrency as more than an investment—it’s a tool for financial inclusion and independence from traditional banking systems. Since making Bitcoin legal tender in 2021, El Salvador has adopted the cryptocurrency to reduce remittance costs, increase economic autonomy, and protect its citizens from inflation. While the policy remains contentious, particularly among institutions such as the IMF, the Bukele administration is steadfast in its confidence that Bitcoin will drive the country’s economic destiny. As Bitcoin’s bullish trend continues, El Salvador’s holdings may climb higher, cementing the country’s pioneering role in global cryptocurrency adoption. Argentina leads lithium tokenisation with blockchain innovation In a ground-breaking move, Paraguayan firm Atómico3 and Taiwan’s Hua Lian Mining have collaborated to tokenise lithium reserves in San Juan, Argentina, via the Cardano blockchain. This endeavour represents a significant step toward combining traditional mining and blockchain technology, allowing lithium assets to be represented as digital currencies. These coins will be available to both institutional and retail investors, enhancing transparency, traceability, and access to funding for renewable energy projects. Argentina has established itself as a mining-tech pioneer in Latin America by converting physical lithium reserves into digital assets. The tokenisation process comprises reserve certification, smart contract implementation, and blockchain connectivity to provide security and transparency. This strategy not only permits global investment but also promotes sustainability and decentralised governance, paving the way for other lithium-rich countries such as Chile, Peru, and Bolivia. USDC expands B2B reach with new partnerships in Brazil Circle, the firm behind the USDC stablecoin, has announced a cooperation with HiFi Bridge to facilitate cross-border B2B transfers between the United States, Brazil, and Hong Kong. HiFi, an API platform meant to ease company payments, has been integrated into the Circle Payments Network. This move follows a similar attempt in June when Coinbase collaborated with Brazilian fintech Matera to offer USDC transactions via PIX, signalling the early adoption of digital payments in the region. In 2024, the worldwide B2B payments sector generated more than $905 billion, with the United States contributing $160 billion to Latin America. Brazil alone got $330 million in remittances in May 2025. Visa has also joined the field with Kob Visa, reporting 30x transaction growth and an estimated $85 trillion B2B market. Meanwhile, Drex, Brazil’s digital currency experiment, shows promise in real estate tokenisation, with authorities praising its ability to improve efficiency and transparency.

2025-07-13T11:45:29,"Bitwise CIO Says ‘Unrelenting Demand’ for Bitcoin Could Boost BTC Closer to $200,000 by End of 2025","The chief investment officer of the crypto asset management firm Bitwise says that aggressive demand for Bitcoin ( BTC ) could boost the crypto king’s price much higher by the end of the year. In a new interview with CNBC Television, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan says that blue-chip institutions having increasing demand for BTC mixed with its limited supply could push the value of Bitcoin by about 70% from current prices. “There’s unrelenting demand from corporations and institutional investors, and that’s colliding with severely limited supply. You know the Bitcoin network only produces 450 Bitcoin per day. Yesterday alone, Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) bought 10,000 Bitcoin. This institutional investment into Bitcoin is a one-time event. It’s going to take years to play out. But I think over the course of those years, there’s going to be this persistent bid where there’s more demand than there is supply. And the natural response to that is what we’re seeing in the market, which is Bitcoin’s price goes higher. I think it has a long way to go. I think it could end the year closer to $200,000. So I would get used to this story of new all-time highs.” Hougan adds that interest in Bitcoin’s use cases is growing, particularly amid rising geopolitical uncertainty. “Bitcoin provides a service which is the ability to store wealth in a digital format without relying on a bank. The vibes are definitely part of it. Vibes influence stocks. They influence bonds, but the underlying driver for the rise is more people want this service that Bitcoin provides. In this uncertain world, where there are tariffs and geopolitical tensions, people want to be able to own their wealth in a digital format.” Bitcoin is trading for $117,470 at time of writing, a marginal decrease on the day.

Under the deal, Animoca plans to allocate up to $100 million worth of Bitcoin to DDC for management. Animoca Brands Partnership Comes as Bitcoin Gains Ground as Treasury The partnership reflects an emerging wave of companies integrating Bitcoin into their treasury strategies as a hedge against inflation and a long-term store of value. DayDayCook first revealed its Bitcoin treasury ambitions in May, announcing a target purchase of 5,000 BTC over three years. The company made an initial move by acquiring 21 BTC for its corporate treasury in the same month. This aligns with a broader corporate shift toward Bitcoin adoption, as firms seek to diversify and protect their assets amid economic uncertainty. While the rise of Bitcoin treasury companies signals growing mainstream acceptance, it has also sparked debate among investors. Some see these entities as critical drivers for wider adoption, while others warn of the risks posed by overleveraged firms that could exacerbate market downturns. Food group DDC Enterprise ($DDC) is partnering with #Web3 firm Animoca Brands to boost its new #Bitcoin treasury strategy! Animoca will commit up to $100M in $BTC , and co-founder Yat Siu will join DDC's Bitcoin council. DDC already holds 368 BTC, up 48.3% since mid-June pic.twitter.com/xoUJsNuymy — Crypto Rose Channel (@rosycutee2) July 13, 2025 Data from BitcoinTreasuries shows 268 institutions currently hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets, spanning public companies, private firms, government bodies, asset managers, and crypto-focused enterprises. Public companies make up the largest segment, accounting for 147 of these holders. The second quarter of 2025 saw these treasury companies add 159,107 BTC, valued at over $18.7 billion, marking a 23% increase in acquisitions from the previous quarter. Blockstream CEO Adam Back described this trend as a “new altseason ,” urging traders to shift investments into Bitcoin or Bitcoin treasuries. Analysts Warn of Risks Ahead for Bitcoin Treasury Companies However, despite the enthusiasm, caution persists. Analysts warn many treasury companies may falter when Bitcoin prices fall or when access to affordable corporate financing tightens, potentially leading to significant market corrections. Last week, Glassnode lead analyst James Check raised concerns over the longevity of the corporate Bitcoin treasury strategy, arguing the easy gains might already be gone for new entrants as the market matures. The warning echoes recent comments from Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, who has voiced concerns over the Bitcoin treasury strategies adopted by some publicly traded firms. Sigel singled out the use of at-the-market (ATM) share issuance programs, arguing that these can become dilutive if a company’s stock price nears its Bitcoin net asset value (NAV). Meanwhile, New York law firm Pomerantz LLP has filed a class action lawsuit against Michael Saylor’s Strategy, accusing the Bitcoin-focused firm of misleading investors about the profitability and risks of its crypto investment strategy.
