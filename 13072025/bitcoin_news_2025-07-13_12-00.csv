2025-07-13T09:15:27,"Billionaire Ray Dalio Warns of Potential 1970s-Style Stagflation, Says There‚Äôs ‚ÄòNot Enough Money To Go Around‚Äô","Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio says that a period of stagflation similar to the one witnessed in the 1970s could be approaching. In a new interview with David Rubenstein, Dalio addresses the US dollar‚Äôs big decline against major currencies this year, saying that it could be foreshadowing an incoming phase of stagflation, which refers to a time of high inflation, high unemployment, and low economic growth. Dalio says in the end, while the dollar may underperform other currencies, those currencies also won‚Äôt be doing well relative to hard assets like gold. ‚ÄúI think the picture would be some version very similar to the 70s‚Ä¶ And the 70s was a period in which there was stagflation. The thing we have to worry about is a stagflationary environment, because all the currencies went down. So when you were looking at ‚Äòdiversification,‚Äô the problems that we‚Äôre talking about are not just American problems. We have a significant problem, but they‚Äôre European problems, they‚Äôre Japanese problems. There are Chinese problems. We‚Äôve lived on promises, to be able to take that debt asset and convert it into money. And now there‚Äôs not enough money to go around, so I would say that when you ask the question, does it devalue in relation to other currencies? Probably, but the other currencies won‚Äôt see much of an appreciation. So that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm saying something like gold will be the better-performing currency.‚Äù The hedge fund legend recently warned that in order to address a looming fiscal crisis, the US government would need to cut spending and raise taxes to lower the annual deficit to gross domestic product (GDP) ratio. ‚ÄúThis printing and devaluing is not good for those holding bonds as a storehold of wealth, and what‚Äôs bad for bonds and US credit markets is bad for everyone because the US Treasury market is the backbone of all capital markets, which are the backbones of our economic and social conditions. Unless this path is soon rectified to bring the budget deficit from roughly 7% of GDP to about 3% by making adjustments to spending, taxes, and interest rates, big, painful disruptions will likely occur.‚Äù Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat ‚Äì Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

With the price holding firm above $118,000 and many now eyeing the $125,000 level, this seems to carry serious weight. What makes this phase even more important is the surrounding environment. The possibility of Federal Reserve rate cuts combined with strong moves inside U.S. regulatory circles has set the stage for a market that could run higher for months. With America‚Äôs top officials speaking openly about advancing crypto‚Äôs future, it is no longer just traders who are excited, as institutional and policy attention has entered the conversation. For anyone looking at crypto now, it is becoming harder to ignore the potential in well-designed projects with true utility. Crypto Week, Federal Policy, and Why Crypto Looks Poised for Growth The U.S. is preparing for what may become a defining moment in the world of digital assets. Bo Hines, who leads the White House‚Äôs focus on crypto, recently made a headline-grabbing statement, saying it is time to make America the leader in this space. This comes as Bitcoin holds its rally, Ethereum pushes above $3,000, and all other top altcoins have also managed to make impressive weekly gains, reflecting strong confidence across the market. JUST IN: üá∫üá∏ US Director of Digital Assets says ""huge week ahead‚Ä¶ time to make America the crypto capital of the world."" ‚Äî Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) July 11, 2025 But price moves are only part of the story. Congress is about to examine key legislation, including the CLARITY Act and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, aimed at creating a clear legal structure for digital assets as well, during the period that has been officially termed by the entity as ‚Äú Crypto Week ‚Äù. At the same time, the Federal Reserve faces its own storm: reports suggest Chair Jerome Powell may soon step down, and many expect interest rate cuts as early as next month. This combination of regulatory progress and economic change is drawing attention from across the financial world. JUST NOW: The Chairman of the board of Fannie & Freddie says he is encouraged that Fed Chair Jerome Powell is considering to resign.

With momentum across price action, policy, and institutional involvement, this period stands out as one of the most promising for careful and forward-looking crypto investment. Best Crypto to Buy Now As the Next Few Weeks Look Bullish for Quality Projects Buying and stocking up on high-quality cryptos right now may be a great idea, especially with the developments happening across the crypto space. From popularity to concept, some projects lead the space right now and are thus worthy of considering as well. Top options include: Snorter Snorter has steadily become one of the most interesting tools for crypto users who rely on Telegram for managing their activity. It is not just another bot that delivers price alerts or surface-level updates. Instead, Snorter offers a deeper layer of functionality: AI-powered portfolio tracking, predictive analytics, and advanced market data, all within the simplicity of Telegram‚Äôs interface. This makes it valuable not only for experienced traders but also for newer participants who want better insights without being overwhelmed by multiple platforms. At a time when optimism is returning to crypto markets, tools like Snorter become even more relevant. Bitcoin‚Äôs surge has reignited interest across the board, and with Federal Reserve rate cuts expected, there is a renewed sense that altcoins and niche platforms may have months of opportunity ahead. Snorter is seen as a gateway for users to handle this fast-moving environment more effectively. Its capabilities and potential for growth were discussed by ClayBro in one of his videos on YouTube, which has furthered the demand for SNORT as well. Its AI models offer users data-backed perspectives, helping them track wallet performance, assess token movement, and explore market patterns, all while staying in one place.

While it began as a playful experiment, it has grown into something with its own economy, where holders engage directly in decisions, liquidity activities, and creative initiatives. Token 6900‚Äôs approach is unconventional, but that is exactly what has given it staying power. It does not rely on marketing stunts or polished campaigns; instead, it thrives on the strength and creativity of its holders, who continuously bring fresh life to the project. In today‚Äôs environment, where Bitcoin‚Äôs rise and major U.S. policy steps are creating stronger interest in crypto, Token 6900 offers something that sets it apart from more typical assets. It has proven it can hold the attention of its community over time without needing to fit into a predictable mold. That kind of resilience matters, especially as the market prepares for changes in regulation and financial conditions, including the anticipated rate cuts.

Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper is designed to address one of the oldest challenges in crypto: Bitcoin‚Äôs limitations as a transaction network. While Bitcoin has always been a powerful store of value, its scalability issues have made it less practical for everyday use. Bitcoin Hyper steps in here, offering a Layer 2 solution that supports faster transactions, lower costs, and a more flexible environment for applications like micropayments and smart contracts. Rather than competing with Bitcoin, it strengthens its potential by building a support layer that expands what the network can handle. In the current climate, where Bitcoin‚Äôs surge has reignited worldwide attention and the U.S. is moving toward more structured regulation, platforms like Bitcoin Hyper stand to play an important role. The upcoming discussions in Congress on key crypto legislation, combined with the likelihood of Federal Reserve rate cuts, have created a moment where innovation matters as much as price. Bitcoin Hyper offers something tangible: it makes Bitcoin more useful for a wider range of use cases, from merchants needing fast settlement to developers creating decentralized applications. As institutional players and policymakers align around the idea of advancing digital assets, Bitcoin Hyper is positioned as a critical part of Bitcoin‚Äôs evolution. For investors looking to focus on projects that offer practical solutions and long-term relevance, Bitcoin Hyper delivers a clear value proposition, not by promising to replace Bitcoin, but by helping it meet the demands of a changing global financial landscape.

In the meantime, many altcoins have extended their gains, with XLM, HBAR, and BONK emerging as today‚Äôs top performers. BTC Stalls at $118K Recall that bitcoin‚Äôs price volatility had largely disappeared since the start of the month, as the asset was confined within a relatively tight range between $105,000 and $110,000. Following a few unsuccessful attempts for a breakout, though, came Wednesday evening when the bulls took full control of the market. During the first wave north, they pushed the cryptocurrency beyond $110,000 and all the way up to $112,000, which set a new all-time high. While bitcoin retraced slightly on the next day, its rally couldn‚Äôt be contained yet, and it shot up to $116,000 on Thursday. Friday saw another impressive leg up that drove the primary digital asset ot almost $119,000 , which became its latest all-time high. This meant that BTC had added over ten grand in less than 48 hours to set a new record. You can check some of the possible reasons behind this mindblowing surge here . Saturday saw little to no action, even though Trump slapped the EU and Mexico with 30% tariffs and warned there would be more if they responded.

The former has added another 17.5% in the past day, extending its weekly gains to over 85%. HBAR has surged by nearly 15% daily and almost 50% weekly, which has pushed its price well beyond $0.22. BONK completes the double-digit price pump club, with a 12% surge of its own. Other big gainers from the larger-cap alts include ALGO, IMX, and MNT, but their increases are noticeably smaller.

As such, the crypto-linked investment products have witnessed a significant influx of capital in recent weeks. The Bitcoin ETFs, however, witnessed the inflow of an unprecedented amount of capital to close the past week. This significant investor activity came as the price of the premier cryptocurrency forged multiple new all-time highs in the space of a few days. Bitcoin ETFs Record $2.72 Billion In Past Week: Report According to the latest market data , the Bitcoin ETFs in the United States posted a total net inflow of $1.03 billion on Friday, July 11. This outstanding performance marked the second straight day of a 10-figure capital influx for the crypto-based investment vehicles. Unsurprisingly, BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Bitcoin Trust (with the ticker IBIT) witnessed the largest net inflow, adding $953.52 million in value to close the week. This strong performance emphasizes the asset manager‚Äôs growing dominance in the crypto ETFs industry ‚Äî as IBIT also recently became the fastest ETF to hit $80 billion in assets under management. ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) came in second place, registering a net inflow of $23.51 million on Friday. Grayscale‚Äôs Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) and VanEck‚Äôs Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (HODL) also managed to post eight-figure inflows, with $20.93 million and $20.01 million, respectively. Bitwise‚Äôs Bitcoin ETF (BITB) and Invesco‚Äôs fund (BTCO) were the only other funds to record positive inflows to close the week. BITB and BTCO posted $6.41 million and $5.3 million, respectively, on the day. It is worth noting that the other Bitcoin ETFs didn‚Äôt witness any net activity. As earlier mentioned, the US Bitcoin ETFs registered over a billion-dollar net inflow for the second consecutive day ‚Äî for the first time since launching in January 2024. These performances in the past two days pushed the weekly record to around $2.72 billion, the fifth-largest weekly inflow. Bitcoin Price Overview The direct relationship between the Bitcoin price and the US Bitcoin ETFs‚Äô inflows continued in the past week. On both days when the funds witnessed a billion-dollar capital influx, the price of BTC experienced a significant price surge, reaching a new all-time high of around $118,700. As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin sits around $117,332, reflecting a 0.3% decline in the past 24 hours.

2025-07-13T07:31:10,"6 Reasons Behind Bitcoin‚Äôs Surge to Uncharted Territory: Can They Push BTC Even Higher?","Bitcoin‚Äôs price revival at the end of the business week caught many short traders off guard as the asset skyrocketed to a new all-time high of almost $119,000 following an extended period of muted movements. Although there was not one single big announcement that could have been related to the explosive rally, there are several reasons that were building up for weeks, which could be attributed to the new peak. Overall Accumulation The following reasons will be combined into one category of ‚Äúoverall accumulation,‚Äù even though they may vary by investor type, different moments of purchases, etc. We will start with the ETFs as they‚Äôre the freshest. As reported yesterday, the spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US attracted more than $2.7 billion within the past five trading days alone. In addition, they have seen only one day in net outflows since June 9. Both of these factors can drive the underlying asset‚Äôs price north, especially when investors spend more than $2 billion to accumulate ETF shares in two consecutive days (July 10 and 11). Next, we will list the accumulation by large companies. Strategy, which admittedly failed to announce a purchase last week, has spent billions in the past few months to acquire more BTC. Its example has been followed to a smaller extent by other companies that now hold bitcoin as a reserve asset, such as Metaplanet , GameStop , and Semler Scientific . Although these purchases might not impact the asset‚Äôs price immediately, their continuous efforts certainly play a role as they reduce the immediate selling pressure. The accumulation trend expands well beyond institutions and large companies. Glassnode reported recently that smaller investors, categorized as shrimps, crabs, and fish (wallets holding less than 100 BTC), have been acquiring more than 19,000 BTC per month. In comparison, miner issuance stands at just 13,400 BTC per month. Looking at accumulation by wallet size: Shrimps, Crabs, and Fish ‚Äì wallets with $BTC ‚Äì are accumulating ~19.3k BTC/month, while miner issuance stands at 13.4k BTC/month. Persistent net absorption across a wide base of holders is creating measurable supply-side tightening. pic.twitter.com/ajut5hlpqv ‚Äî glassnode (@glassnode) July 12, 2025 The aforementioned purchases from various types of investors, most of whom are transferring their BTC holdings out of exchanges, lead us to the next reason (yes, they are related). According to CryptoQuant, the amount of BTC stored on trading platforms has declined to the lowest level in a decade, another signal that investors are looking for the long term. Macroeconomic Reasons The reasons above paint a clear picture that investors are accumulating. Now, let‚Äôs get down to why they might be doing so. Although Trump bombarded numerous nations and entire Unions with new sets of tariffs in the past few weeks, including on Saturday, the effect is nowhere near as devastating to BTC as it was back in April. At the time, bitcoin‚Äôs price collapsed to a five-month low, while now, the tariffs are somehow considered beneficial for the cryptocurrency. As analysts from QCP put it: ‚ÄúWill Trump delay implementation once again? That remains to be seen. But repeated cycles of tariff threats and postponements have contributed to positive uncertainty. Business sentiment and manufacturing indices have remained firmly in expansion territory.‚Äù BREAKING: President Trump sends out more ‚Äútariff letters‚Äù with the following tariff rates now announced: 1. Brazil: 50% 2. Myanmar: 40% 3. Laos: 40% 4. Cambodia: 36% 5. Thailand: 36% 6. Bangladesh: 35% 7. Canada: 35% 8. Serbia: 35% 9. Indonesia: 32% 10. European Union: 30% 11.‚Ä¶ ‚Äî The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) July 12, 2025 In the meantime, we will conclude our reasoning with the declining US dollar index. Experts have long predicted a massive parabolic move for BTC once the greenback loses traction. This is because investors tend to jump into store-of-value assets, such as gold and bitcoin, in times when the dollar is weak. Nicolai Sondergaard, Research Analyst at Nansen, told CryptoPotato that although he didn‚Äôt believe this rally was mostly driven by macro events, he thinks certain US policies have attributed to it. ‚ÄúRecent U.S. policy developments such as fiscal expansion and expectations of further monetary easing have created a backdrop that is undeniably favorable for Bitcoin.‚Äù Will BTC Keep Surging? The big question now is whether these reasons will continue to push the cryptocurrency higher. In a memo to CryptoPotato , analysts from Bitfinex seemed optimistic. ‚ÄúUnless ETF inflows collapse or macro takes a sharp turn, the structure remains intact. Bitcoin has flipped $111k‚Äì$114k into support, and as long as that holds, the trend is higher. For traders, the message is simple: respect the flows, watch for funding dislocations, and stay tactical around round-number resistance levels for Bitcoin.‚Äù Nevertheless, they warned that ‚Äúno rally goes up in a straight line.‚Äù The analysts added that BTC could be due for a correction first, as they have already started to ‚Äúsee some signs of temporary exhaustion.‚Äù Nansen‚Äôs Sondergaard also weighed in on whether bitcoin has the strength to keep marching forward: ‚ÄúBitcoin recently broke through key liquidation levels and managed to hold above them, which I believe signaled there was more room for upside. On the technical side, Bitcoin‚Äôs daily RSI has climbed above 70, which is typical in strong momentum phases. It‚Äôs not inherently bearish; RSI rising during price rallies is normal. However, if price continues to rise while RSI starts to diverge or decline, that could be an early signal of fading momentum and the potential for a correction.‚Äù The post 6 Reasons Behind Bitcoin‚Äôs Surge to Uncharted Territory: Can They Push BTC Even Higher? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",cryptopotato,https://cryptopotato.com/6-reasons-behind-bitcoins-surge-to-uncharted-territory-can-they-push-btc-even-higher/,"BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|FIAT|EXCHANGE","BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|featured1|Bitcoin (BTC) Price",cryptocompare
2025-07-13T07:30:17,"Bitcoin Price Could Soar To $146K In The Next Leg Up ‚Äî Analyst Explains How","After going on an impressive run to close the week, the Bitcoin price has become relatively steady over this weekend. The premier cryptocurrency has shown some signs of indecision and continued to move sideways within the $117,000 and $118,000 range. According to a prominent online pundit, the Bitcoin price might be at a critical juncture that could decide its future over the next few weeks. Insights from a technical analysis model suggest that the price of BTC might run up to an unprecedented high of $143,000 once it overcomes the next resistance level. BTC Needs To Break This Resistance Level To Continue Rally In a July 12 post on social media platform X, Alphractal founder & CEO Joao Wedson revealed that the Bitcoin price faces significant resistance between $118,900 and $120,000. This price evaluation is based on the Bitcoin Power Law model, which provides a mathematical description of BTC‚Äôs historical price trends. Related Reading: Bitcoin SOPR Signals More Gains Ahead Despite New ATH ‚Äì Analyst The Bitcoin Power Law model estimates the network effect and adoption curve without speculation. Using this framework, the pricing model provides long-term support and resistance levels or ‚Äúbands‚Äù on the Bitcoin price chart. Wedson revealed that the Power Law model indicates that the Bitcoin price faces significant resistance between the $118,900 and $120,000 region. According to the on-chain analyst, the market needs to breach the Alpha Price ‚Äî which lies somewhere around $119,300. For context, the Alpha Price refers to a major inflection point in the Power Law model and a level that the Bitcoin price needs to break and stay above to enter the next significant phase of the bull cycle. In essence, the BTC price must witness a sustained break above $119,300 to continue its rally. Wedson mentioned that the price of BTC will need to show resilience in order to breach the psychological $120,000 level. However, it might need to consolidate first and perhaps take some long traders out of the market before overcoming the $120,000 level, the on-chain analyst noted. According to Wedson, a sustained breach of the $120,000 level¬†will signal the beginning of an even much bigger rally for the market leader. The on-chain analyst put the target for this rally at between $143,000 and $146,000, marking the Bitcoin price top in this cycle. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $117,530, reflecting no significant movement in the past 24 hours. Nevertheless, the flagship cryptocurrency is up by nearly 9% on the weekly timeframe.

2025-07-13T07:04:30,"Fold CEO Warns Altcoins To Remain Speculative, Says Bitcoin‚Äôs Market Dominance ‚ÄòSomething That Can‚Äôt Be Reversed‚Äô","The chief executive of Bitcoin ( BTC ) financial services firm Fold is issuing a warning about altcoins, saying that the crypto king‚Äôs market dominance isn‚Äôt something that will backtrack. In a new interview with CNBC Television, Fold CEO Will Reeves says that the top crypto asset by market cap‚Äôs recent new all-time high was due to a combination of high institutional demand and low supply. ‚ÄúThis is what happens when massive demand meets the finite supply of Bitcoin. And what we‚Äôre seeing right now is the supply shock in motion. So I‚Äôd certainly say what we are seeing is the fundamentals of Bitcoin in play‚Ä¶ What we‚Äôve seen recently with the rise of Bitcoin treasury companies, the ETFs (exchange-traded funds) is that entirely new classes of capital are able to invest in the asset. What we‚Äôre seeing is what happens when trillions of dollars start knocking on the door ‚Äì the price tends to go up.‚Äù According to Reeves, the market‚Äôs appetite for BTC will cause its dominance levels to irreversibly rise ‚Äì a trend that would leave countless altcoins competing for capital. ‚ÄúFrankly, I think [altcoins] will remain speculative. Bitcoin dominance is at 60% and rising. I think what we‚Äôre seeing is an inevitable trend towards the signal, the apex asset. The issue is that Bitcoin is the only credibly neutral digital asset that is in issuance. All the other tokens are still proving extraordinarily speculative use cases without the track record of Bitcoin. And so what we are seeing today is the continued march of Bitcoin dominating this entire market‚Ä¶ Ultimately, what we‚Äôve seen is something that can‚Äôt be reversed.‚Äù Bitcoin is trading for $117,613 at time of writing, a sideways move on the day. Meanwhile, Bitcoin dominance, which measures how much of the total crypto market cap belongs to BTC, stands at 64.58%.

A popular crypto analyst with almost 140,000 followers on X believes this could be just the beginning and envisioned a further surge to and beyond $1 if ADA breaks through a key resistance level, which is being tested now. Cardano $ADA is breaking through a key resistance level, opening the door for a rally to $0.90‚Äì$1.20! pic.twitter.com/4dj8jQfJFN ‚Äî Ali (@ali_charts) July 13, 2025 This important resistance that could hinder ADA‚Äôs progress is situated somewhere around $0.74, a level the asset is very familiar with, as it managed to contain its price ascent earlier this year. ADA managed to breach it briefly during the Friday price surge that drove it to a two-and-a-half-month high of almost $0.78, but the bears quickly regrouped and didn‚Äôt allow a decisive closure above it. In fact, the last time Cardano‚Äôs token traded sustainably above $0.74 was in mid-May. Since then, the asset underwent a substantial correction that drove it down to $0.5 at one point. Nevertheless, ADA is still the top performer on a weekly scale from the 12 largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, having gained almost 30%. Thus, it has increased more than XRP (26%) and HYPE (22%). This impressive price surge comes just a few weeks after IOG proposed that the treasury would trade $100 million worth of ADA for BTC and stablecoins to enhance the blockchain‚Äôs DeFi ecosystem. The move met immediate resistance from some members, who claimed that it could lead to a more painful sell-off and price declines. Charles Hoskinson was quick to mock the naysayers after ADA surged past $0.7 and became a top performer. Remember when we were told that a 100 million dollar trade of ada would collapse the price? https://t.co/kYm5CKw97O pic.twitter.com/tPZiROv37i ‚Äî Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) July 11, 2025 The post ADA Is Breaking Out: Will Cardano Surge Past $1 Next? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",cryptopotato,https://cryptopotato.com/ada-is-breaking-out-will-cardano-surge-past-1-next/,"ADA|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET","ADABTC|ADAUSD|Crypto Bits|Crypto News|Cardano (ADA) Price",cryptocompare

For now, it looks like the high-risk trader finally crashed out, as his personal X account has been deactivated. Searching for Wynn‚Äôs old username, ‚ÄúJamesWynnReal,‚Äù on X now returns an error message that says, ‚ÄúThis account doesn‚Äôt exist.‚Äù Right before he deactivated his account, Wynn changed his profile description to ‚Äúbroke.‚Äù Wynn‚Äôs old X username returns an account error.

Due to this, Wynn received a lot of attention and scrutiny from fellow traders. His strategy relied on making high-leverage bets on Hyperliquid while enjoying the benefits of the resulting social media engagement. More often than not, the trader watched the market react opposite to his bet. Wynn lost hundreds of millions betting on BTC futures During May, Wynn‚Äôs position in BTC stood to lose roughly $100 million when Bitcoin‚Äôs price slipped below $105k. That triggered liquidations of 949 BTC, effectively erasing his long-BTC holdings. In a post he later removed, Wynn said, ‚ÄúI do not follow proper risk management, nor do I claim to be a professional; if anything, I claim to be lucky. I‚Äôm effectively gambling, and I stand to lose everything. I strongly advise people against what I‚Äôm doing.‚Äù Instead of slowing down, Wynn once again opened a $100 million bet days later. Wynn claimed that market makers were intentionally targeting his positions to force a liquidation. Seeking relief, he asked the community for help. Up to 24 unique wallet addresses sent donation funds to his account. Shortly after receiving those donations, Wynn sold 240 BTC to push down his liquidation price on his remaining positions. Still, the trader couldn‚Äôt save his position and ultimately lost over 99 percent of the second $100 million position. $198.68 million got liquidated from the broader crypto market in 24 hours Meanwhile, the broader crypto futures market saw massive liquidations over the last 24 hours. Liquidation data from CoinGlass at press time shows a total of $198.68 million wiped out in perpetual futures. Long positions accounted for $132.75 million of that total, while shorts made up $65.93 million. Ethereum traders felt the pinch as well, with $30.84 million in positions closed out. Of that, $21.14 million were longs and $9.26 million were shorts. XRP followed, tallying $16.89 million in liquidations, $13.27 million on the long side, and $3.62 million short.

2025-07-13T06:00:26,"Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Remain Steady As CDD Normalizes After False Alarm","Bitcoin is testing uncharted territory after breaking past its previous all-time high of $112,000 last Thursday, igniting a powerful new phase in the bull market. With the price currently hovering above $117,000, bulls are firmly in control as optimism spreads across the crypto market. The breakout comes after weeks of tight consolidation, signaling renewed confidence among investors and traders. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Continues Historic Climb ‚Äì Altcoins Struggle To Gain Ground On-chain data from CryptoQuant adds further support to the bullish narrative. The Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric‚Äîused to assess whether long-term holders are selling‚Äîhas returned to a relatively low average despite the rise in price. This suggests that experienced holders are not offloading their positions, but instead continuing to hold through the rally. With long-term holders largely inactive and momentum accelerating, Bitcoin appears to be entering a decisive phase. As macroeconomic conditions remain favorable for risk assets, and with institutional demand rising, all eyes are now on how BTC behaves at these new highs‚Äîand whether the rest of the crypto market will follow its lead. Bitcoin Prepares For A Massive Surge Bitcoin continues to trade above key psychological and technical levels, signaling that the market is entering an expansion phase with the potential for a massive surge. After clearing its previous all-time high and consolidating around $117,000, Bitcoin‚Äôs structure looks increasingly bullish. Analysts and traders are closely watching on-chain indicators to confirm whether long-term holders are beginning to exit, but so far, the data suggests they are not. Top analyst Darkfost shared relevant insights regarding the Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric, a key tool used to assess long-term holder activity. CDD calculates how long a Bitcoin stays unmoved before a transfer, revealing long-term participants‚Äô behavior. Recently, the metric saw a sharp spike, raising initial concerns about possible distribution. However, it was later confirmed that the move involved 80,000 BTC in an internal transfer ‚Äî no actual selling occurred. Since that event, the CDD has returned to its previous low range, especially when compared to Bitcoin‚Äôs soaring price. This signals that long-term holders are still sitting tight, showing no urgency to sell into strength. Their conviction reflects growing expectations of higher prices ahead, supported by macro conditions, increasing adoption, and rising institutional interest. With strong hands holding firm and momentum building, Bitcoin appears poised for continuation. As long as key support levels are maintained and long-term holders remain inactive, the setup favors an explosive move that could redefine price discovery in this cycle. Related Reading: Crypto Founder Pushes Ethereum As ‚ÄòWorld Reserve Asset‚Äô ‚Äì Details Price Discovery Kicks In: Momentum Accelerates Bitcoin‚Äôs three‚Äëday chart shows a textbook breakout from eight weeks of compression.

The candle body towers well above the 50‚Äëperiod SMA, while the 100‚Äë and 200‚Äëperiod averages slope higher beneath, confirming a bullish long‚Äëterm structure. The old resistance band between $105,000 and $109,300 now flips into first demand; any orderly retest that wicks into that zone would likely attract sidelined buyers.

2025-07-13T05:51:50,"Retail Investors Sit Out Bitcoin Rally as Institutions Drive ETF Surge","Despite Bitcoin hitting new all-time highs last week, retail investors have been notably absent from the action, according to market analysts. Meanwhile, institutional interest has surged, particularly in the form of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which saw more than $1 billion in inflows on both Thursday and Friday ‚Äî a back-to-back milestone never previously achieved. Institutional Surge Behind Latest Price Move Bitwise head of research Andr√© Dragosch observed in a Friday post that although Bitcoin is soaring, mainstream interest has yet to catch up. ‚ÄúBitcoin is at new all-time highs but retail is almost nowhere to be found,‚Äù he wrote, referencing data showing weak Google search trends for the term ‚ÄúBitcoin.‚Äù This suggests the current rally is primarily fueled by institutions, not individual investors. Search Trends Fail to Reflect Price Surge Google Trends data supports this narrative. Between June 29‚ÄìJuly 5 and July 6‚Äì12, global searches for ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äù increased by just 8%, even as Bitcoin‚Äôs price broke past its previous all-time high of $111,970 and continued climbing to $118,780 by Friday. This subdued retail interest contrasts sharply with the surge seen in November 2024, when search interest peaked following Donald Trump‚Äôs election win. At that time, retail engagement helped propel Bitcoin past the $100,000 mark for the first time. Retail Sentiment: ‚ÄúMissed the Boat‚Äù Some crypto commentators believe that retail investors are sitting out because they feel priced out of the market. ‚ÄúI think a lot of retail folks find out the price of one Bitcoin is 117k and think, nahhh I missed the boat and don‚Äôt even give it a second thought,‚Äù said Bitcoin analyst Lindsay Stamp. Cedric Youngelman, host of the Bitcoin Matrix podcast, shared a similar sentiment, asking his followers, ‚ÄúAt what Bitcoin price do you think retail wakes up? I‚Äôll go first. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre coming for a long time.‚Äù Analysts Say Rally Still Has Momentum Despite low retail participation, market experts believe the current rally has more room to run. Bitcoin on-chain analyst Willy Woo commented, ‚ÄúThis run has plenty of legs left in it.‚Äù The continued interest from institutional players suggests that Bitcoin‚Äôs momentum is far from over. Spot ETFs Remain the Main Driver Spot Bitcoin ETFs had an exceptionally strong week, pulling in a total of $2.72 billion over five trading days, according to Farside data. This wave of capital suggests institutional demand remains robust. However, the trend has raised questions about how to measure actual retail interest in the current market landscape. Cointelegraph recently noted that if the ultimate holders of Bitcoin ETF shares are retail investors, then interpreting on-chain data could become more complex. Conclusion While Bitcoin continues to scale new heights, the retail crowd appears hesitant to reenter the market. Whether due to price anxiety or market fatigue, their absence is notable ‚Äî especially in contrast to the flood of institutional capital pouring into ETFs. As the rally unfolds, attention now turns to whether retail investors will follow ‚Äî or continue to watch from the sidelines.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/retail-investors-sit-out-bitcoin-rally-as-institutions-drive-etf-surge/,"BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET|RESEARCH","Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence",cryptocompare

Bitcoin was trading at $118,000, while some altcoins like Bonk, Alpaca Finance (ALPACA), Kyber Network Crystal (KNC), and Phoenix (PHB) surged by double digits. Bonk price prediction Bonk, the biggest Solana meme coin, has done well in the past few days, moving from a low of $0.000011 to the current $0.00002590, its highest level since May 12. This surge happened in a high-volume environment, with its daily volume soaring to over $1.2 billion, higher than Trump Coin, Pugy Penguins, and Fartcoin, combined. Bonk price has moved above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) and the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level at $0.00002080. The MACD indicator and other oscillators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) have all pointed upwards. Therefore, the token will likely keep rising as bulls target the 50% Fibonacci Retracement level at $0.00003440. A drop below the support at $0.00002080, the 23.6% retracement level will invalidate the bullish Bonk price forecast. Bonk price chart | Source: TradingView Alpaca Finance price forecast One notable thing that happens during a crypto bull run is that some small altcoins jump sharply for no reason. One of those that did that was Alpaca Finance, a decentralized finance (DeFi) product for leveraged products. Alpaca Finance is a crypto project offering leveraged yield farming products. It helps lenders earn safe and stable yields and offers undercollateralized loans for leveraged yield farming positions. Alpaca Finance recently announced that it would shut down its platform following the delisting from Binance.

This surge was likely because of the Wyckoff Theory, in which it has now moved into the markup phase. The MACD indicator is about to do a bullish crossover, while the Relative Strength Index has moved to the overbought level. Therefore, the ALPACA price will likely resume the downtrend as the network‚Äôs final days arrive.

It is a top player in decentralized finance that has handled over $20 billion in volume over time.

The daily chart shows that the KNC price went through a short-squeeze, surging from a low of $0.2684 on July 1 to $0.7686, its highest level since December 9. The surge happened after the token formed a falling wedge pattern, a popular bullish reversal pattern.

2025-07-13T04:11:34,"Bitcoin Miner Bosses Are Raking in Millions ‚Äì And Investors Are Furious","Executives at US-listed Bitcoin mining firms are taking home pay packages far larger than their peers in energy and IT. Equity-heavy compensation structures are driving up totals and drawing increasing shareholder resistance, according to new findings from VanEck. Miner CEOs Outpace Tech and Energy Peers Across eight miners that VanEck reviewed ‚Äì Bit Digital, Cipher Mining, CleanSpark, Core Scientific, Hut 8, Marathon Digital, Riot Platforms, and TeraWulf ‚Äì executive pay averaged $14.4 million in 2024. This is more than double the previous year‚Äôs $6.6 million, and significantly above averages in the energy and technology sectors. Such a surge has occurred even as base salaries for mining executives remain broadly in line with other industries, averaging $474,000 in 2023. The primary driver is the sector‚Äôs reliance on stock-based compensation, which accounted for 89% of miner executive pay in 2024, compared to lower allocations in comparable sectors. While stock-based incentives can align management with investors, VanEck‚Äôs analysis indicates many miners continue to structure these awards with short- to medium-term vesting, limited performance gating, and dilution risks that erode shareholder value. Shareholders appear to be pushing back. Across broader corporate America, nearly 99% of executive pay proposals passed during the 2024 proxy season, while S&P 500 and Russell 3000 companies typically witness 90% or higher support rates. By contrast, Bitcoin miners saw an average support rate of just 64%. Six of the eight miners, including Riot, Core Scientific, Hut 8, Cipher, TeraWulf, and Marathon, have expanded the use of performance stock units (PSUs). These typically vest over multiple years, tied to share price or total shareholder return benchmarks. Marathon has transitioned fully to PSUs in 2025, and Cipher now uses a 50/50 split between restricted stock units and PSUs. Core Scientific reintroduced its long-term incentive plan with performance-linked stock after reorganization. These changes indicate a move away from purely time-based vesting and toward longer-term alignment, although not all firms have fully adopted these practices. CleanSpark, for one, has not implemented PSUs. The same is true for Bit Digital as well. Despite authorizing them, it has yet to issue them according to its latest filings. Pay-for-Performance Misalignment The question of whether these pay structures are delivering value remains. VanEck‚Äôs comparison of total executive pay with each miner‚Äôs 2024 market-cap growth shows stark contrasts. At TeraWulf and Core Scientific, executive pay amounted to around 2% of the firms‚Äô market-cap increases. This pointed to relatively efficient pay-for-performance alignment. On the other hand, Riot‚Äôs executives received $230 million, which is equivalent to 73% of the company‚Äôs 2024 market-cap gains, while Marathon‚Äôs executive pay was 18% of its market-cap growth. Such disparities have drawn scrutiny, particularly given Riot‚Äôs history of shareholder pushback on pay proposals and concerns over dilution tied to expanding equity compensation plans.

2025-07-12T22:08:59,"Bitcoin Surge Ignites $10 Billion Crypto VC Boom: Biggest Funding Quarter Since 2022","Venture capital funding activity picked up sharply in Q2 2025. In fact, CryptoRank revealed that funding reached $10 billion, making this year its strongest showing since early 2022. The stats come amidst rising Bitcoin prices and a thaw in risk appetite, which encouraged investors to re-engage with the sector. Crypto VC Roars Back According to the report shared by CryptoRank, the recovery was driven heavily by June‚Äôs $5.14 billion haul. This period witnessed the highest monthly tally since January 2022, following a long period of sluggish deal activity. The sharp uptick aligns with Bitcoin‚Äôs rally above $100,000. During the quarter, major players like Strive Funds, founded by Vivek Ramaswamy, pulled in $750 million for Bitcoin-focused alpha strategies in May. Next up were TwentyOneCapital, which raised $585 million in April, and Securitize, which managed to secure $400 million. Other notable raises included Kalshi, Auradine, ZenMEV, and Digital Asset, which raked in $185 million, $153 million, $140 million, and $135 million, respectively. The venture capital arm of Coinbase, Coinbase Ventures, emerged as the most active investor. It executed 25 deals in Q2, ahead of Pantera Capital, Animoca Brands, and Andreessen Horowitz. Meanwhile, Paradigm led in the number of lead investments, while Galaxy Digital closed its first external venture fund at $175 million, surpassing its initial target to back high-growth crypto subsectors, including stablecoins, tokenization, and payment rails. Amsterdam‚Äôs Theta Capital also added over $175 million to its fund-of-funds to support early-stage blockchain startups. Other Trends CryptoRank‚Äôs data also shows that while seed-stage deals still command the largest slice of activity at nearly 19%, strategic and Series A rounds are steadily growing with 14% and 6% respectively. Interest in M&A is also picking up as distressed opportunities continue to emerge in the sector, with a share of around 10%. The rebound in venture funding comes amid muted memecoin investment trends. In addition to that, monthly crypto fundraising throughout April, May, and June was led by blockchain services, consistently outpacing DeFi and CeFi.
