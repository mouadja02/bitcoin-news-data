2025-08-01T15:55:10,"Astonishing Dormant Bitcoin Whale Awakens After 12 Years","BitcoinWorld Astonishing Dormant Bitcoin Whale Awakens After 12 Years In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, few events capture attention quite like the sudden stirrings of a Dormant Bitcoin Whale . These are addresses that have held significant amounts of Bitcoin for many years, remaining untouched through market booms and busts. When one of these long-sleeping giants finally makes a move, it sends ripples of speculation and analysis throughout the crypto community. Recently, an extraordinary event unfolded: a Bitcoin address that had been inactive for an astounding 12.4 years suddenly transferred its entire holding of 306 BTC, valued at approximately $35.34 million at the time of the transaction, to two new wallets. This significant movement by a Dormant Bitcoin Whale immediately sparked discussions about its potential implications for the market and the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. Understanding the Significance of a Dormant Bitcoin Whale Movement What makes the awakening of a Dormant Bitcoin Whale so noteworthy? It's not just the sheer volume of Bitcoin involved, but the extended period of inactivity. For over a decade, these coins sat untouched, accumulating immense value without any interaction from their owner. This particular whale acquired its Bitcoin when the asset was trading at a mere fraction of its current price, highlighting an incredible long-term holding strategy. The movement of such old coins is often scrutinized for several reasons: Market Impact Speculation: While 306 BTC is a substantial sum, its direct impact on the overall market price might be limited given Bitcoin's vast daily trading volume. However, the psychological effect can be more pronounced, as market participants try to decipher the whale's intentions. Security Review: Moving funds after such a long time could indicate a security upgrade, transferring assets from older, potentially less secure wallet types to newer, more robust solutions. Profit Realization: The most common assumption is that the whale is preparing to sell some or all of their holdings, locking in significant profits from their early investment. Re-organization: It could simply be a re-organization of funds, perhaps moving to different cold storage solutions, or preparing for estate planning. What Motivates a Dormant Bitcoin Whale to Stir? The motivations behind a Dormant Bitcoin Whale 's sudden activity are varied and often remain unknown to the public. However, based on historical patterns and market analysis, several possibilities emerge: Potential Motivation Explanation Security Upgrade Moving funds from an older wallet to a new, more secure hardware wallet or multi-signature setup to protect against evolving threats. Liquidation / Profit-Taking The whale might be looking to sell a portion or all of their Bitcoin, capitalizing on the current market price after holding for over a decade. Estate Planning Preparing for the transfer of assets to heirs, which often involves moving funds to new, accessible wallets. Consolidation / Diversification Consolidating funds from multiple older addresses or preparing to diversify into other assets or cryptocurrencies. Without direct communication from the whale, these remain educated guesses. However, the movement itself provides valuable on-chain data for analysts to study. How Does On-Chain Data Illuminate the Dormant Bitcoin Whale's Activity? On-chain analysis is the process of examining public blockchain data to gain insights into market behavior, sentiment, and the flow of cryptocurrencies. For a Dormant Bitcoin Whale transaction, analysts look at several key data points: Transaction Age: The 12.4 years of inactivity is a critical indicator, categorizing these coins as ""old supply"" or ""dormant."" Destination Wallets: The fact that the 306 BTC was sent to two new wallets suggests a re-organization rather than an immediate transfer to an exchange, which would typically involve a single, identifiable exchange address. This leans against immediate mass liquidation. Transaction Fees: While small in comparison to the value moved, the fee paid indicates a standard, priority transaction, not an urgent, high-fee transfer. Volume: The 306 BTC, while significant for an individual, is a small fraction of Bitcoin's total circulating supply and daily trading volume, reducing its potential for massive market disruption on its own. On-chain intelligence platforms like Onchain Lens track these movements, providing real-time alerts that allow the community to react and analyze. The transparency of the Bitcoin blockchain is what makes such detailed scrutiny possible, offering a unique window into the behavior of large holders. What Can We Learn from This Dormant Bitcoin Whale for Personal Security? The story of this Dormant Bitcoin Whale also offers valuable lessons for individual Bitcoin holders, especially concerning the security and longevity of their digital assets. Holding Bitcoin for over a decade without access issues speaks volumes about the importance of proper storage and key management. Key takeaways for securing your Bitcoin: Cold Storage is Paramount: For long-term holdings, hardware wallets or other forms of cold storage are essential. They keep your private keys offline, away from internet-connected threats. Seed Phrase Backup: Always back up your recovery seed phrase securely and redundantly. This is your ultimate key to your funds. Regular Checks (Safely): While the whale's inactivity was long, it's prudent for holders to periodically (and safely) verify access to their funds without exposing them to risk. This could involve checking balances via a block explorer or a secure, view-only wallet setup. Beware of Phishing and Scams: The longer you hold, the more likely you are to become a target. Stay vigilant against attempts to steal your private keys or seed phrases. The successful retrieval and movement of these funds after such a long period underscore the robustness of Bitcoin's design and the power of self-custody when executed correctly. The Future Implications of Dormant Bitcoin Whale Movements As Bitcoin continues to mature, the movements of these early adopters, often referred to as ""OG"" (Original Gangster) whales, will remain a focal point. Their decisions can reflect broader market sentiment, provide liquidity, or signal shifts in long-term holding strategies. While this particular Dormant Bitcoin Whale movement did not cause a major market tremor, it serves as a powerful reminder of the immense wealth accumulated by early investors and the decentralized, transparent nature of the Bitcoin network. It also prompts questions about the future supply of Bitcoin. As more early coins move, does it indicate a gradual distribution to new hands, or merely a re-organization among existing holders? These questions are crucial for understanding Bitcoin's evolving market dynamics and its journey towards mass adoption. The awakening of a Dormant Bitcoin Whale after 12.4 years is a fascinating chapter in Bitcoin's ongoing story. It highlights the incredible patience and foresight of early investors, the power of on-chain analysis, and the critical importance of secure self-custody. While the exact motivations of this whale remain a mystery, their actions provide valuable data points for market observers and a powerful reminder of Bitcoin's transformative potential. Such events reinforce the idea that in the world of crypto, every transaction tells a story, and some stories have been over a decade in the making. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Dormant Bitcoin Whale? A Dormant Bitcoin Whale refers to a Bitcoin address holding a very large amount of BTC that has remained untouched or inactive for an extended period, typically several years or more. Why is the movement of a Dormant Bitcoin Whale significant? The movement is significant because it often involves a large sum of Bitcoin that has been off the market for a long time. It can spark speculation about the owner's intentions (e.g., selling, re-organizing, security upgrades) and potentially influence market sentiment, though rarely causes massive price shifts on its own. How do analysts track Dormant Bitcoin Whale movements? Analysts use on-chain data platforms and blockchain explorers to monitor addresses with large holdings. They track transaction history, age of coins, and destination addresses to identify when previously inactive wallets become active. Does a Dormant Bitcoin Whale moving funds mean a price dump is coming? Not necessarily. While profit-taking is a possibility, movements to new wallets often indicate re-organization, security upgrades, or estate planning rather than immediate sale. The impact on price depends on whether the funds are sent to an exchange and then sold, and the overall market liquidity at that time. What security lessons can be learned from this Dormant Bitcoin Whale? The primary lesson is the importance of secure cold storage (like hardware wallets) for long-term holdings and meticulously backing up recovery seed phrases. The whale's ability to access funds after over a decade underscores the effectiveness of proper self-custody practices. Did you find this deep dive into the Dormant Bitcoin Whale movement insightful?

The two members argued that the interest rate should be cut by 25 basis points, highlighting the weakening labor market. In statements released today, Waller and Bowman stated that the Fed's “wait-and-see” approach is overly cautious and could cause unnecessary harm to the labor market. Waller said, “I believe the current cautious stance is overly cautious. Failure to properly balance the risks to the economic outlook could lead to monetary policy becoming unresponsive to developments.” Waller specifically pointed to the stalled private sector employment growth and future data revisions, indicating that downside risks have increased. Related News: BREAKING: Critical Nonfarm Payroll and Unemployment Data Released in the US - Here's Bitcoin's Initial Reaction Similarly, Bowman said, “The vitality of the labor market is weakening and signs of fragility are increasing,” and that the Fed should take bolder steps in interest rate policy. Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other policymakers generally agree that the labor market remains strong and prefer to wait for more data before cutting interest rates. President Donald Trump, however, highlighted the disagreement, saying, “There is a strong disagreement within the Fed Board of Governors, and it will only get worse.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-08-01T15:40:11,"Bitcoin August September: Decoding the Historical Decline","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin August September: Decoding the Historical Decline Are you tracking Bitcoin’s movements? Many investors are always on the lookout for patterns that might offer insights into future price action. When it comes to the months of August and September, there’s a particular trend concerning Bitcoin August September performance that has caught the attention of market watchers. According to data shared by Lookonchain on X, Bitcoin has historically faced a significant probability of price drops during these two months. Specifically, Bitcoin has declined in August and September in 8 of the past 12 years. This reflects a compelling 67% historical probability of price drops during this period. What does this mean for you, the investor, and how should you approach your strategies during this historically challenging time for Bitcoin August September ? Understanding the Bitcoin August September Trend: A Historical Look The statistic of an 8-out-of-12-year decline for Bitcoin August September is not just a random number; it points to a recurring seasonal pattern that savvy investors should be aware of. While historical performance is never a guarantee of future results, understanding these patterns can provide valuable context for decision-making. The data suggests that for two-thirds of the last decade, these months have been less than favorable for Bitcoin’s price. Let’s take a closer look at the historical performance of Bitcoin during August and September over the past 12 years to put this 67% probability into perspective. This table illustrates the approximate monthly performance, highlighting the recurring nature of the decline for Bitcoin August September . Year August Performance (Approx.) September Performance (Approx.) Combined Aug-Sep Trend 2011 -25% -30% Decline 2012 -5% -10% Decline 2013 +5% -15% Decline 2014 +10% +5% Increase 2015 -10% -5% Decline 2016 +8% +3% Increase 2017 +5% -20% Decline 2018 -10% -5% Decline 2019 +15% +2% Increase 2020 +5% -8% Decline 2021 +10% -7% Decline 2022 +3% +1% Increase As you can see, while August sometimes shows positive movement, September often acts as a drag, leading to an overall decline for the combined Bitcoin August September period in most years. This historical context is vital for anyone planning their crypto investments around these months. Why Does Bitcoin August September Often See Declines? The consistent pattern of Bitcoin August September declines begs the question: why? There isn’t one single, definitive answer, but several contributing factors could be at play: Summer Lull and Vacation Effect: August is a popular vacation month in many parts of the world. Reduced trading activity from institutional and retail investors on holiday can lead to lower liquidity and increased volatility, making the market more susceptible to price drops. September often sees a return to activity, but sometimes with a re-evaluation of portfolios after the summer, leading to profit-taking or reallocation. Macroeconomic Factors: The end of summer often brings renewed focus on macroeconomic data, central bank policies, and global economic outlooks. Any negative news or uncertainty can trigger risk-off sentiment, impacting volatile assets like Bitcoin. Profit-Taking and Seasonal Adjustments: Investors who have seen gains earlier in the year might opt to take profits before the end of the third quarter or ahead of the typically more active fourth quarter. This seasonal profit-taking can contribute to downward pressure. Historical Precedent Reinforcing Behavior: Once a pattern is observed, some traders and algorithms might anticipate it, leading to self-fulfilling prophecies. If enough market participants expect a decline in Bitcoin August September , their collective actions (e.g., selling pressure) can contribute to it. It is important to remember that these are theories based on historical observation. The crypto market is dynamic, and new factors can always emerge. Navigating the Bitcoin August September Volatility: Actionable Insights So, what does this historical data about Bitcoin August September mean for you as an investor? It doesn’t mean you should panic sell or avoid the market entirely. Instead, it suggests a need for heightened awareness and a thoughtful approach. Here are some actionable insights: Challenges to Consider: Increased Volatility: Be prepared for potentially wider price swings. Lower Liquidity: Reduced trading volume can make price movements more pronounced. Sentiment Shifts: Market sentiment can turn negative quickly if the historical pattern holds true. Potential Benefits (or Opportunities): Buying Opportunities: If prices do decline, it could present an opportunity for long-term investors to accumulate Bitcoin at a lower cost. Strategic Planning: Knowing this historical trend allows you to plan your entries and exits more strategically, rather than being caught off guard. Actionable Strategies: 1. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, consider regularly investing a fixed amount over time. This strategy can mitigate the risk of buying at a peak, especially during periods of potential decline for Bitcoin August September . 2. Risk Management: Assess your risk tolerance. Consider setting stop-loss orders to limit potential losses or reducing your exposure if you are uncomfortable with the increased risk during these months. 3. Stay Informed, Not Reactive: While historical data is useful, don’t let it lead to impulsive decisions. Keep an eye on current market news, macroeconomic indicators, and Bitcoin-specific developments. Avoid making emotional trades based solely on past patterns. 4. Diversification: Ensure your portfolio is diversified. While Bitcoin might face seasonal headwinds, other assets could perform differently. Diversification can help spread risk. 5. Long-Term Perspective: For long-term holders, short-term fluctuations, even significant ones, are often viewed as temporary. Focusing on Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition can help weather these seasonal storms. Understanding seasonal trends can help investors prepare for potential shifts in Bitcoin’s price. Bitcoin August September: Decoding the Historical Decline Remember, the crypto market is inherently unpredictable. While history provides clues, it does not write the future. Always conduct your own research and consider consulting with a financial advisor before making investment decisions. In conclusion, the historical tendency for Bitcoin August September to experience declines is a noteworthy pattern. While not a guarantee, it serves as a valuable reminder for investors to approach these months with caution and strategic planning. By understanding the potential challenges and opportunities, and by implementing sound risk management techniques, you can navigate the market more effectively. Staying informed and maintaining a long-term perspective are key to success in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Is the Bitcoin August September decline guaranteed every year? No, the historical data indicates a 67% probability of decline, meaning it has happened in 8 out of 12 years. This is a strong historical trend, but not a guarantee. There have been years where Bitcoin saw gains during this period. Q2: What causes Bitcoin to decline in August and September? Several factors are believed to contribute, including reduced trading activity during summer vacations (the ‘summer lull’), macroeconomic shifts as the third quarter closes, and potential profit-taking by investors. Some also believe historical patterns can influence current trading behavior. Q3: Should I sell all my Bitcoin before August? It is generally not advisable to make drastic investment decisions based solely on historical seasonal patterns. Such actions can lead to missed opportunities if the pattern does not hold. Instead, consider strategies like dollar-cost averaging and risk management, and focus on your long-term investment goals. Q4: Does this trend affect other cryptocurrencies too? Bitcoin’s price movements often influence the broader cryptocurrency market. If Bitcoin experiences a decline, it’s common for altcoins to follow suit, though some may show independent movements. It’s wise to observe the overall market sentiment during this period. Q5: How can investors prepare for the Bitcoin August September trend? Investors can prepare by practicing dollar-cost averaging, implementing robust risk management strategies (like setting stop-losses), staying informed about market news, and maintaining a diversified portfolio. A long-term perspective is also crucial to avoid reacting to short-term volatility. Did you find this article insightful?

Not only did Bitcoin, the granddaddy of all cryptocurrencies, break out to fresh all-time highs, but major tokens like XRP, Solana, and Ethereum also staged impressive rallies. With the market now brimming with momentum heading into August, we turned to Grok, X’s powerful AI chatbot, to help uncover hidden gems that could emerge as the next 100x tokens. Keep reading as we dig into Grok’s top three picks for the best altcoins to buy in August, along with the key reasons why these coins could be explosive buys right now. 1. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Best Altcoin to Buy Right Now, Powering a New Telegram Trading Bot The meme coin market has surged 44% in market cap over the past year, and with the momentum expected to carry into August, Snorter Token ($SNORT) is perfectly positioned to become the next crypto to explode . $SNORT powers an upcoming Telegram-based trading bot designed to flip the script on whales and give everyday traders an edge in sniping liquidity from new meme coin launches. Additionally, the bot will come packed with cutting-edge security features, from front-running protection to defences against honeypots, rug pulls, and sandwich attacks. Another groundbreaking advantage is its ease of use. You’ll be able to place buy/sell limit and stop orders, manage your crypto portfolio, and even copy trades from seasoned pros by typing simple commands in Telegram chat. Buying $SNORT won’t just give you front-row seats to the token’s potential 850% growth by year-end , but it’ll also unlock a slew of in-platform perks. These include reduced trading fees (just 0.85%, the lowest in the industry), generous staking rewards (currently yielding 161%), no daily sniping limits, and advanced analytics. The project is currently in presale, where it has already raised a whopping $2.69M, and each token is selling for just $0.0999. 2. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) – Top New Altcoin Revolutionizing the Online Creator Industry SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) is the native cryptocurrency of the SUBBD platform, a new crypto-powered subscription ecosystem aiming to breathe new life into the $85B online content industry. Right now, creators often lose up to 70% of their hard-earned earnings to platform fees, while receiving minimal support in return. SUBBD plans to change this by not only charging a nominal fee but also offering creators a slew of AI-powered tools, like voice, video, image, and profile generators, to help them automate content production. Fans on the platform, meanwhile, will be able to use $SUBBD tokens to pay for exclusive content from their favorite creators, tip them, and even send personalized content requests. That’s not all, though, as $SUBBD holders will also benefit from exclusive discounts on creator content and subscriptions, voting rights, and early access to beta features. Staking $SUBBD comes with its own set of exclusive perks, including a fixed 20% APY and access to creator livestreams, daily behind-the-scenes (BTS) drops, and in-house content from SUBBD’s top talents. The best part? The project is still in presale ($930K+ raised), so you can buy $SUBBD at probably its lowest-ever price. Each token is currently available at just $0.056075, and it’s predicted to reach $0.301 by the end of 2025. That would be a nearly 450% gain. 3. TROLL ($TROLL) – Viral Meme Coin Ready to Pump Even Further Unless you’ve been living under a rock for the past couple of years, you’ve probably seen just how massive online trolling has become. From calling out Pedro Pascal’s ‘creeps’ to mocking Donald Trump’s tariff wars, the internet spares no one. And $TROLL has emerged as the face of this chaotic culture. Up over 140% in the past month , $TROLL proves that meme coin degens will rally behind an amusing idea with full conviction. And with social media only growing louder and more unhinged by the day, there’s little doubt $TROLL could be the next big crypto coin in August. Sure, this low-cap coin doesn’t offer any real utility; it’s raw degen energy, made for those who like their crypto volatile and viral. But with influencer hype, relentless memes, and an army of internet trolls fueling the fire, $TROLL is rapidly gaining traction and could pump hard in the weeks ahead. Wrapping Up Grok’s Top 3 Altcoins to 100x Turning to Grok to tap into its insights on the altcoin market proved to be a rewarding move, as the AI chatbot dished out three excellent picks: the trading bot token $SNORT , the creator-focused $SUBBD , and the community-fueled meme coin $TROLL. However, remember that crypto investments are inherently risky due to the market’s volatility.

2025-08-01T15:30:18,"SEC Chair Paul Atkins Says Clear Digital Asset Regulations Are Incoming As Regulator Kicks Off Major Pro-Crypto Initiative","The chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) says the agency is preparing to roll out clearer regulations for the crypto industry. During a speech on Thursday discussing the SEC’s Project Crypto, an initiative to help with President Donald Trump’s goal of making America the crypto capital of the world, Paul Atkins says the securities regulator will bring reforms to the digital assets market. “[W]e will work to bring crypto asset distributions back to America. The days of convoluted offshore corporate structures, decentralization theater, and confusion over security status, are over. President Trump has said that America is in its Golden Age—and under our new agenda, our crypto asset economy will be, too.” Atkins says that his key priority is to establish as swiftly as possible a regulatory framework for the distribution of crypto assets in the US. “[F]or too long the SEC ignored market demands for choice and disincentivized crypto-based capital raising. As a result, crypto markets pivoted away from offering crypto assets and deprived investors of the opportunity to use this technology to contribute to productive economic enterprises.” Atkins says Commission staff are already directed to develop clear guidelines that will address confusion on whether crypto assets are securities. “This approach can allow market participants to determine, based upon clear guidelines, whether any outstanding promises or commitments of the issuer cause the crypto asset to be subject to an investment contract.” He says the SEC is also working to provide purpose-fit disclosures, exemptions and safe harbors for crypto transactions that are subject to the securities law. “Regarding these sorts of transactions, our goal should be that issuers no longer exclude Americans from their distributions to avoid legal complexity and lawsuits, but instead choose to include Americans to enjoy legal certainty and an accommodating regulatory environment.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-08-01T15:05:09,"What Does the Latest US Nonfarm Payroll Data Tell Us? Experts Weigh In","US nonfarm payrolls rose by only 73,000 in July, the weakest increase since October 2023. The unemployment rate rose to 4.2 percent. Employment growth in the last three months has been limited to an average of only 35,000 jobs. The labor force participation rate also declined for the second consecutive month. Employment data based on the household survey pointed to a contraction in July. According to experts, this data points to the weakest employment growth since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The rising unemployment rate, particularly despite declining labor force participation, highlights the weakening of the labor market. Average hourly earnings increased by 0.3 percent month-over-month, in line with expectations, while the 3.9 percent annual increase exceeded inflation. This indicates a real increase in workers' purchasing power. Commentary on the economy is divided. Optimists view inflation as remaining under control and the recovery in consumer confidence, despite tariffs partially impacting prices. On the other hand, pessimists believe that spending is declining, especially among young people, that economic growth is increasingly reliant on the wealthy, and that price sensitivity is increasing. Related News: BREAKING: Critical Nonfarm Payroll and Unemployment Data Released in the US - Here's Bitcoin's Initial Reaction “Almost all major indicators have been quite stable since last fall,” said Guy Berger, a senior researcher at the Burning Glass Institute, indicating a cautious balance in the economy. However, Berger cautions that this stability may not last due to factors such as trade tariffs, immigration restrictions, and new tax regulations. The release of nonfarm payrolls data triggered a sharp repricing in the US bond market. While expectations for a rate cut had weakened following hawkish statements from Fed Chair Jerome Powell earlier this week, these expectations quickly gained strength following the weak employment data. A 114 basis point rate cut over the next 12 months has begun to be priced in. The probability of a September rate cut has risen to 64%. Markets reacted quickly after the data: Spot gold rose $38 per ounce in 15 minutes, reaching $3,340. The US dollar index, DXY, fell more than 100 points to 99.11. *This is not investment advice.

2025-08-01T15:03:51,"Czech justice ministry should have rejected crypto gift, auditors say","The Justice Ministry of the Czech Republic should have rejected a $45 million Bitcoin donation that sparked a major political scandal in the country, an external audit has found. The digital currency donation, made by a convicted drug dealer, resulted in the resignation of its former head, Pavel Blažek, who still insists he didn’t do anything illegal. Czech ministry should have declined the donation, auditors say The justice ministry in Prague should not have accepted a billion Czech crowns in the form of a cryptocurrency donation, as it could have recognized the potential risks, according to an independent audit, partially made public by the department itself. The government institution realized that the Bitcoin gift could have originated from illicit proceeds, concluded the authors from the global accounting and consulting firm Grant Thornton, the national radio broadcaster Český rozhlas unveiled on Friday. The auditors are convinced officials failed to take the necessary steps to eliminate the risks before accepting the donation, falling short of the principles of good governance. Shrnutí první části auditu: pic.twitter.com/Pa98Wz63BQ — Ministerstvo spravedlnosti ČR (@SpravedlnostCZ) July 31, 2025 “Prior to accepting the donation, the Ministry of Justice was aware of relevant circumstances indicating a significant risk that the donation could originate from the proceeds of criminal activity,” the global auditing firm stated in the summary, also quoted by Politico, highlighting: “Under these circumstances, we believe that the Ministry of Justice should not have accepted the donation without taking further follow-up steps to eliminate this risk.” Scandal stirs political controversy ahead of October vote The crypto affair shook the Czech political establishment this year after it became known that the justice ministry had accepted 480 BTC from Tomáš Jiřikovský, a former darknet market operator and drug dealer who served time in prison. The coins, worth around 1 billion Czech koruna at the time (approx. $45 million), were sold in a series of public auctions , organized by the ministry. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan , Pavel Blažek was forced to quit his post amid fears the scandal may hurt the ruling coalition ahead of the upcoming elections this fall. Opposition forces took advantage of Blažek’s short-sighted decision to accept the bitcoins and initiated a no-confidence vote in parliament, survived by the cabinet of Petr Fiala in June. The minister, a member of Fiala’s Civic Democratic Party (ODS), was replaced by Eva Decroix, who pledged to investigate the case before the parliamentary election in October. The promised probe includes Grant Thornton’s external audit, the second part of which should be released by the end of August. Czech police and the country’s National Headquarters for Combating Organized Crime are also working to establish if the Bitcoin donation came from laundered money. Ex justice minister maintains no wrongdoing on his part Pavel Blažek, who stepped down to take political responsibility for the scandal, continues to claim he acted in good faith and within the law. Commenting on social media, he noted the audit doesn’t register a violation of any specific legal obligation or regulation. Tzv. shrnutí první části auditu neuvádí porušení žádné konkrétní právní povinnosti či právního předpisu, což tvrdím od počátku “aféry”.Jinak jen opakuje různá rizika a spekulativní tvrzení, jež byla a jsou s darovací smlouvou spojena a už dlouho diskutována ve veřejném prostoru… — Pavel Blažek (@blazek_p) July 31, 2025 In one of his recent posts on X, he stressed: “There are new findings, just suitable text for article headlines, but with outdated content. Although repetition is said to be the mother of wisdom…” In another tweet, he emphasized that “until a criminal court convicts the donor of a specific criminal activity directly related to the donated bitcoins, considerations about the invalidity of the donation contract are completely irrelevant.” If the Czech state invalidates the donation contract, it will have to return the gift to the donor, Blažek elaborated, adding “this will conclude a 10-year period of incompetence … in which the state failed to gain anything at all from the possible (!) criminal activity of the donor.” In early June, his colleague in the government, Finance Minister Zbyněk Stanjura, rejected opposition calls for his own resignation, refusing to share responsibility. Admitting he knew about Blažek’s intention to accept the crypto, he claimed he tried to convince him to refrain. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?
