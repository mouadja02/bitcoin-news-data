2025-07-31T21:55:11,"Urgent Alert: Bitcoin Price Faces Critical Weakness Ahead of August Downturn","BitcoinWorld Urgent Alert: Bitcoin Price Faces Critical Weakness Ahead of August Downturn The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic beast, constantly shifting and evolving. Just when you think you’ve got a handle on its movements, a new report emerges, urging caution. Recently, 10x Research, a prominent name in crypto analytics, issued a significant warning that has caught the attention of investors worldwide: the Bitcoin price might be heading for a period of notable weakness, particularly as we approach the historically challenging month of August. This isn’t just a speculative guess; it’s backed by seasonal trends and a closer look at on-chain capital flows, painting a nuanced picture of what could be ahead for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Is the Bitcoin Price Headed for a Summer Slump? Markus Thielen, the astute lead analyst at 10x Research, has highlighted a compelling historical pattern concerning the Bitcoin price in August. His research indicates that this particular month has, more often than not, been Bitcoin’s weakest performer. We’re talking about significant pullbacks, with most years experiencing losses ranging from 5% to a substantial 20%. This isn’t just a recent phenomenon; it’s a recurring theme in Bitcoin’s volatile history. While the crypto market is known for its unpredictable swings, understanding these seasonal tendencies can provide investors with a valuable edge. What makes August so challenging for the Bitcoin price ? While no single factor is definitive, several theories exist. Historically, August falls within the summer holiday period in many parts of the world, leading to decreased trading activity and potentially lower liquidity. This ‘summer lull’ can make the market more susceptible to larger price movements on lower volume. Additionally, institutional investors and whales might reduce their activity, contributing to less buying pressure. Thielen’s analysis reinforces the idea that ignoring these historical patterns could be a costly mistake for those invested in Bitcoin. Unpacking the On-Chain Inflow Puzzle: What Does it Mean for Bitcoin Price? Beyond seasonal trends, 10x Research’s report delves into another critical metric: on-chain capital flows. These flows represent the movement of funds into and out of the Bitcoin network, offering insights into investor sentiment and demand. Alarmingly, the report points to a decline in these inflows. The 30-day rolling average of capital flows has dipped from $62.4 billion to $59.3 billion. This reduction isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it signals a potential shift in market dynamics, suggesting that the influx of new capital, which typically fuels upward price momentum, is slowing down. CoinDesk reported on these findings, emphasizing that a decline in on-chain inflows often precedes or accompanies a consolidation phase for the Bitcoin price . While Bitcoin has seen impressive total inflows, exceeding $1 trillion, with a significant $206 billion flowing in during 2024 alone, Thielen notes that the price impact has been ""surprisingly muted."" This observation raises a crucial question: if such massive capital is entering the ecosystem, why isn’t the Bitcoin price reacting with the explosive gains many expect? This disconnect could indicate that existing holders are selling into strength, or that the new capital is being absorbed without creating significant upward pressure, casting shadows of doubt on immediate further upside potential. Navigating Potential Support Levels: Where Could the Bitcoin Price Find Stability? Understanding potential downside risks is crucial for risk management. The 10x Research report doesn’t just warn of weakness; it also provides specific price targets for potential support levels, offering a roadmap for investors to consider. According to Thielen’s projections, a breakdown below the $117,000 mark for the Bitcoin price could trigger further declines. Should this level fail to hold, the next significant support is identified around $112,000. For a deeper correction, the report suggests a range between $106,000 and $110,000 as a potential consolidation zone. These levels are not arbitrary; they often correspond to previous areas of significant trading activity, psychological barriers, or technical indicators. Investors and traders typically watch these support zones closely, as they can represent opportunities for accumulation or areas where selling pressure might temporarily abate. Preparing for these scenarios allows market participants to make informed decisions rather than reacting impulsively to market volatility. Historical Resilience: Can Bitcoin Price Defy August’s Curse? Despite the ominous warnings, there’s a silver lining that bulls might cling to. Markus Thielen himself acknowledged that August hasn’t always been a losing month for the Bitcoin price , especially during post-halving bull markets. He specifically pointed to years like 2013, 2017, and 2021, which saw notable gains in August following a Bitcoin halving event. These periods were characterized by strong underlying bullish momentum, often driven by renewed investor interest, technological advancements, or broader market euphoria. The key question then becomes: are current market conditions similar enough to these historically positive post-halving Augusts? While Bitcoin did experience its latest halving in April 2024, the broader economic landscape, regulatory environment, and institutional adoption narrative are constantly evolving. Investors must weigh the current macro factors and on-chain data against these historical precedents. While history doesn’t repeat itself exactly, it often rhymes. Understanding these nuances is vital for forming a balanced outlook on the future trajectory of the Bitcoin price . Actionable Strategies for Navigating Bitcoin Price Volatility Given the mixed signals and potential for heightened volatility, what can investors do to protect their portfolios and potentially capitalize on market movements? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Continuously monitor reports from reputable research firms like 10x Research and news outlets like CoinDesk. Market sentiment can shift rapidly, and staying updated on the latest analysis is paramount. Risk Management is Key: Implement robust risk management strategies. This includes setting stop-loss orders to limit potential losses, diversifying your crypto portfolio beyond just Bitcoin, and only investing what you can afford to lose. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of attempting to time the market, consider a DCA strategy. This involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the Bitcoin price . This approach helps average out your purchase price over time and can mitigate the impact of short-term volatility. Monitor On-Chain Metrics: Pay attention to on-chain data beyond just price. Metrics like exchange inflows/outflows, active addresses, and mining difficulty can offer deeper insights into the underlying health and demand for Bitcoin. Prepare for Both Scenarios: While the warning points to weakness, the market is unpredictable. Have a plan for both a downside correction and a potential rebound. Identify your entry and exit points for various scenarios. The current market outlook for the Bitcoin price is undeniably complex. While 10x Research’s warning about seasonal weakness and declining on-chain inflows presents a cautious near-term view, it’s essential to remember Bitcoin’s historical resilience, especially during post-halving periods. The market is a constant interplay of fear and greed, data and sentiment. By staying informed, understanding the underlying dynamics, and employing sound investment strategies, you can navigate these challenging waters with greater confidence. The coming weeks will be crucial in determining whether Bitcoin succumbs to historical patterns or defies expectations once again. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is 10x Research’s main concern about the Bitcoin price? 10x Research is primarily concerned about potential Bitcoin price weakness in August, citing historical seasonal downturns and a noticeable decline in on-chain capital inflows as key indicators. Q2: Why is August historically considered a weak month for Bitcoin? Historically, August has shown a pattern of negative returns for Bitcoin, with losses often ranging from 5% to 20%. This could be attributed to factors like reduced trading activity during summer holidays and lower market liquidity. Q3: What do declining on-chain inflows suggest for the Bitcoin price? Declining on-chain inflows, as reported by 10x Research, suggest a slowdown in new capital entering the Bitcoin ecosystem. This can indicate a potential consolidation phase or a lack of strong buying pressure, which may lead to muted price action or even downward pressure on the Bitcoin price . Q4: What are the key support levels for Bitcoin identified in the report? The report projects a potential breakdown below $117,000, with key support levels identified at $112,000 and a deeper range between $106,000 and $110,000. Q5: Are there any historical precedents for Bitcoin gaining in August despite the general weakness? Yes, Markus Thielen noted that Bitcoin has seen gains in August during post-halving bull markets, specifically in 2013, 2017, and 2021. These instances offer a glimmer of hope for bulls, suggesting that strong underlying market momentum can sometimes override seasonal trends. Q6: How can investors prepare for potential Bitcoin price volatility? Investors can prepare by staying informed, implementing strong risk management strategies like stop-loss orders, considering dollar-cost averaging (DCA), monitoring on-chain metrics, and having a plan for both upward and downward market movements.

2025-07-31T21:45:30,"Algorand Foundation releases its roadmap for 2025 and 2026","Algorand Foundation has released its roadmap for 2025 onwards with plans to launch new infrastructural products in the coming years. The foundation stated that the roadmap is part of its efforts to boost real-world blockchain adoption. According to the press release from the foundation, its new roadmap will focus on four key areas, including simplifying user experience and accelerating innovation to deliver constant upgrades to the network. It noted that part of the innovation will focus on enabling use cases that support stablecoins, tokenizations, and AI agents while improving the network security and privacy standards to be quantum-resistant. Speaking on its plans, Algorand Foundation CEO Staci Warden noted the new roadmap is all about Algorand building the right infrastructure for the future on-chain economy. She said: “This roadmap lays the groundwork to onboard a new generation of people and enterprises that need the blockchain-based products of the future, but that don’t need to know what a blockchain is or how it works under the hood.” Meanwhile, the Foundation’s principal engineer, Bruno Martins, noted that the roadmap focuses on developers and builders. According to him, the core goal is to make it easy to deploy and use projects on the Algorand network, and he expects more builders to launch on the protocol. Algorand plans major product releases for 2025 and 2026 Interestingly, Algorand already has a slate of products set for release between Q3 of 2025 and Q4 of 2026. According to the foundation, these products will address its core goals for the next few years. One such product is xGov Governance, an on-chain community governance framework set to launch by Q3 of 2024. The framework is expected to be used for allocations of grants on the network, starting with an xGov council before full implementation in 2026. Beyond that, the foundation plans to improve developers’ experience by launching AlgoKit 4.0 in the first half of 2026. This software development kit (SDK) is expected to enable easy deployment on Algorand with new SDKs for programming languages such as Kotlin, Swift, and Rust, in addition to Python and Typescript, which Algorand already supports. Other planned products include a self-custody wallet, Rocca Wallet, set for full launch in the first half of 2026, and Agentic Security and Identity Framework that will allow AI agents to execute on-chain transactions on Algorand. The foundation added that it will further beef up institutional compatibility by launching Intermezzo, a custodial solution for businesses integrating blockchain technology. With the tool, released in Q3 of 2025, enterprises can use Algorand for treasuries, loyalty programs, and other business models. WorldChess has already adopted it for its on-chain loyalty program. ALGO sinks further Meanwhile, the roadmap release has not had much impact on the Algorand native token ALGO’s performance. While many people were excited about the roadmap ahead of its release, ALGO is down almost 1% in the last 24 hours and has lost 6% of its value in the past week. Its price decline today coincides with the general market struggles, with Bitcoin falling to $116,500 range after trading as high as above $118,900 earlier in the day. With BTC’s decline, almost all other major cap assets have also fallen in value, with ETH and SOL down by around 1% each. However, ALGO struggles extend beyond today’s performance, given that the token, which is trading at $0.25, is down by 33.36% year-to-date. Its poor performance is more pronounced when compared with its peak price of $3.56 back in 2019, showing it is 93% down from its all-time high. The poor performance of ALGO is likely connected to the decline in activity on Algorand. The blockchain network has slowly lost relevance compared to competitors such as Ethereum, Solana, BNB Smart Chain, Sui, Aptos, or Layer-2 networks. Per Defillama data, it has a total value locked (TVL) of $79.91 million, putting it at 49th on the list of networks with the biggest TVL, showing just how little DeFi activity happens on it. With the new roadmap, investors in ALGO will be hoping to see the Layer-1 network record a resurgence. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-07-31T21:41:36,"Strategy Bets Big: $4.2B STRC Offering Targets Massive Bitcoin Purchase","Bitcoin heavyweight Strategy has launched a fresh $4.2 billion at-the-market (ATM) equity program for its STRC preferred shares, deepening its commitment to an aggressive equity-to-Bitcoin acquisition strategy. The filing , submitted to the SEC and announced late Thursday, follows the company’s strongest quarterly performance on record and comes amid a sharp expansion of its Bitcoin treasury. Strategy Announces $4.2 Billion STRC At-The-Market Program https://t.co/4wOYjw8B2u — Michael Saylor (@saylor) July 31, 2025 The STRC program, designed for Variable Rate Series A Perpetual Stretch Preferred Stock, provides Strategy with the flexibility to raise capital over time, depending on market conditions. Proceeds from the offering are expected to be channeled into general corporate purposes, including working capital and dividends on previously issued preferred shares. However, consistent with Strategy’s stated objectives, a major portion is anticipated to be allocated directly to purchasing additional Bitcoin . The move builds on the momentum of four other ATM programs already in operation. Each has allowed Strategy to convert investor capital into digital assets, reinforcing CEO Michael Saylor’s long-standing belief in Bitcoin as a superior corporate treasury asset. The firm’s filing indicates its intent to continue leveraging equity markets to support its expanding crypto strategy, which now spans multiple asset classes and preferred share structures. Saylor’s Strategy: Profits, BTC, and Scalable Capital Programs Amid Soaring Equity Demand Strategy’s second-quarter earnings report , released just after the STRC announcement, showed a sharp rise in profitability. Net income surged to over $2.3 billion, driven by unrealized gains on Bitcoin holdings during a quarter when the price of BTC soared above $110,000. This represented a nearly 140% increase from Q1, indicating the material impact of the company’s digital asset position on its bottom line. Source: Strategy Its Bitcoin holdings, which stood at 628,212 BTC as of July 29, are currently valued at roughly $69.4 billion. This includes a recent purchase of 14,620 BTC disclosed earlier this week, acquired using proceeds raised through existing ATM equity programs. SEC filings show that between July 14 and July 20, Strategy raised over $740 million by selling multiple classes of shares, a mix of common and preferred. Strategy’s momentum is also visible in its capital markets activity, which has generated more than $10.5 billion in gross proceeds in just the last four months. Between April and the end of June, the company secured $6.8 billion through multiple stock issuance programs. An additional $3.7 billion was raised between July 1 and July 29 across both public offerings and ATM facilities. A sizable portion of that capital is already being recycled into Bitcoin. The largest tranche came from Strategy’s Common Stock ATM Program, which brought in over $6.3 billion during that time frame through the issuance of nearly 16.7 million shares. Even after those sales, $17 billion remains authorized under its May 2025 common equity program. In addition to common equity, Strategy is leveraging preferred shares across several new products. Its STRK ATM program generated over $518 million during the same period, while the STRF ATM program raised approximately $219 million. The company’s May IPO of STRD stock added $979 million, and its follow-up STRD ATM launch in July has raised $17.9 million so far, with $4.2 billion still available. @MicroStrategy doubles down, acquiring 21,021 #Bitcoin after closing the largest U.S. IPO of 2025 worth $2.52B with its new STRC preferred stock. #Startegy #Bitcoin https://t.co/BNc5V6UfhF — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 29, 2025 STRC itself also saw a strong cash infusion even before the ATM program was announced. Strategy raised $2.5 billion in its initial STRC stock offering , selling over 28 million shares at $90 each. The preferred stock includes a variable monthly dividend, with the first $0.80 payout declared on July 31 and scheduled to be paid on August 31 to shareholders of record as of August 15.

2025-07-31T21:30:55,"MicroStrategy Bitcoin: Unveiling the Astounding $10 Billion Q2 Profit and Bold Acquisition Plan","BitcoinWorld MicroStrategy Bitcoin: Unveiling the Astounding $10 Billion Q2 Profit and Bold Acquisition Plan Imagine a company that, in a single quarter, pulls in a staggering $10 billion in net income, primarily from its strategic bet on a digital asset. This isn’t a fantasy; it’s the latest reality for Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy. Their audacious commitment to Bitcoin continues to yield remarkable results, positioning them as a unique player in both the corporate and cryptocurrency landscapes. The firm’s recent Q2 2025 report highlights an astounding period of growth, largely fueled by the surging value of its MicroStrategy Bitcoin holdings. This isn’t just about profit; it’s about a pioneering corporate treasury strategy that is redefining how companies view their balance sheets. The Astounding Success of MicroStrategy Bitcoin Holdings According to a recent report by Wu Blockchain on X, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) has reported an eye-popping $10 billion in net income for Q2 2025. This colossal figure underscores the profound impact that Bitcoin’s price appreciation has had on the company’s financial health. For a firm primarily known for its business intelligence software, this pivot to becoming a de facto Bitcoin holding company has paid off handsomely, demonstrating an unprecedented level of conviction in the world’s leading cryptocurrency. This isn’t just a one-off gain; it’s the culmination of a deliberate and consistent strategy initiated years ago. Strategy’s decision to adopt Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset was, at the time, seen by many as highly unconventional, even risky. Yet, under the guidance of its visionary leadership, the company has steadfastly accumulated Bitcoin, transforming its balance sheet and delivering substantial value to shareholders. The Q2 profit is a testament to the long-term potential of a bold MicroStrategy Bitcoin investment strategy. Why is MicroStrategy Investing So Heavily in Bitcoin? The question on many minds remains: why such an unwavering commitment to Bitcoin? Strategy’s rationale is multifaceted and deeply rooted in a macroeconomic outlook that sees traditional fiat currencies depreciating over time. Here are the core reasons driving their aggressive MicroStrategy Bitcoin accumulation: Inflation Hedge: The company views Bitcoin as a superior store of value, a digital gold that can protect corporate assets from inflationary pressures and currency debasement. Long-Term Value Appreciation: Strategy believes Bitcoin is in its early stages of adoption and will continue to appreciate significantly as it becomes a global reserve asset and a primary means of wealth transfer. Capital Allocation Efficiency: Rather than holding cash that loses purchasing power, the company opts to convert excess capital into a scarce, decentralized asset with perceived long-term growth potential. Pioneering Institutional Adoption: By being the first publicly traded company to make such a significant commitment, Strategy aims to set a precedent and encourage other corporations to consider Bitcoin for their treasury reserves. This strategic foresight has not only propelled their own growth but has also played a crucial role in legitimizing Bitcoin as a serious asset class for institutional investors worldwide. Their transparent and consistent approach to acquiring MicroStrategy Bitcoin has made them a bellwether for corporate crypto adoption. Understanding MicroStrategy’s Bold $4.2 Billion Raise The firm’s commitment isn’t just about holding existing assets; it’s about active expansion. Strategy has announced plans to raise an additional $4.2 billion through the issuance of STRC perpetual preferred stock. The explicit purpose of this massive capital raise? To buy more Bitcoin. This move signals an incredibly bullish outlook on Bitcoin’s future price trajectory and reinforces their ‘Bitcoin maximalist’ stance. The scale of their ambition is evident in their recent acquisition spree. In Q2 alone, Strategy significantly expanded its Bitcoin portfolio: Start of Q2 Holdings: Approximately 499,000 BTC End of Q2 Holdings: Approximately 597,000 BTC Total Holdings (Post-Q2 acquisitions mentioned): An astounding 628,800 BTC To put this into perspective, Strategy’s total holdings of 628,800 BTC represent roughly 3% of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply. This makes them, by far, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, dwarfing even some institutional funds. The planned $4.2 billion raise will only solidify their position as the leading corporate proponent of MicroStrategy Bitcoin adoption. What Does This Mean for the Future of MicroStrategy and Bitcoin? Strategy’s ongoing Bitcoin strategy has profound implications for both the company itself and the broader cryptocurrency market. For Strategy, its stock performance has become increasingly correlated with Bitcoin’s price movements, effectively transforming it into a proxy for Bitcoin exposure in traditional equity markets. This unique positioning attracts a specific type of investor looking for a publicly traded vehicle to gain exposure to digital assets. For Bitcoin, Strategy’s continued accumulation and public advocacy lend significant credibility. Each new purchase, especially one as large as the planned $4.2 billion raise, sends a strong signal to the market about institutional confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value. It highlights a growing trend of corporations exploring digital assets as legitimate components of their financial strategy. This relentless pursuit of MicroStrategy Bitcoin holdings contributes to Bitcoin’s scarcity narrative and strengthens its position as a global macro asset. Navigating the Risks and Rewards of MicroStrategy Bitcoin Strategy While the recent profit figures are compelling, it’s essential to consider both the rewards and potential challenges associated with Strategy’s high-conviction MicroStrategy Bitcoin strategy. Potential Rewards: Exponential Growth Potential: If Bitcoin continues its long-term upward trajectory, Strategy’s holdings could lead to immense shareholder value. Pioneering Market Position: The company has carved out a unique niche, attracting investors specifically interested in Bitcoin exposure through a traditional stock. Inflation Hedging: A strong defense against the erosion of purchasing power for corporate treasury assets. Potential Challenges: Bitcoin Price Volatility: While beneficial during bull runs, significant price drops could lead to substantial unrealized losses, impacting financial reports and investor sentiment. Concentration Risk: A large portion of the company’s value is tied to a single, volatile asset, increasing overall risk. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies could introduce unforeseen challenges. Dilution Risk: Issuing new stock, even preferred stock, can dilute existing shareholder value if not managed effectively against the appreciation of the underlying asset. For investors, Strategy’s journey offers valuable insights into high-conviction investing. It demonstrates the potential rewards of a long-term, patient approach to assets believed to have transformative potential, but also highlights the importance of understanding and accepting significant volatility. Strategy’s Q2 2025 financial report is more than just numbers; it’s a powerful affirmation of their pioneering MicroStrategy Bitcoin strategy. The $10 billion profit, largely attributable to Bitcoin’s performance, coupled with the ambitious $4.2 billion raise for further acquisitions, solidifies their position as a leading corporate evangelist for digital assets. This bold approach not only generates significant returns but also pushes the boundaries of corporate finance, signaling a new era where Bitcoin plays an increasingly central role in global treasury management. As the firm continues its journey, the world watches to see how this unprecedented bet on Bitcoin will reshape both corporate balance sheets and the future of finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Strategy’s primary business? Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, is primarily a business intelligence, mobile software, and cloud-based services company. However, in recent years, it has become widely recognized for its corporate treasury strategy centered on accumulating Bitcoin. How much Bitcoin does MicroStrategy own? As of the end of Q2 2025, and including subsequent acquisitions mentioned, Strategy’s total MicroStrategy Bitcoin holdings reached approximately 628,800 BTC. Why is Strategy raising $4.2 billion? Strategy plans to raise $4.2 billion through the issuance of STRC perpetual preferred stock specifically to acquire more Bitcoin, further increasing its already substantial holdings. What is STRC perpetual preferred stock? STRC perpetual preferred stock is a type of equity security issued by Strategy. ‘Perpetual’ means it has no maturity date, and ‘preferred’ typically means it pays fixed dividends and has priority over common stock in claims on assets and earnings. How does MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy impact its stock price? Strategy’s stock price (MSTR) has shown a strong correlation with Bitcoin’s price movements. Investors often view MSTR as a way to gain exposure to Bitcoin through a publicly traded company, making its stock performance highly sensitive to BTC’s value. Is MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy risky? While the strategy has yielded significant profits, it carries inherent risks due to Bitcoin’s price volatility, regulatory uncertainties, and the concentration of a large portion of the company’s assets in a single, albeit transformative, digital asset.

2025-07-31T21:07:53,"Strategy reports $14.03B in Q2 operating income and $10.02B in net income","Strategy posted its biggest quarterly earnings ever in Q2 2025, and the reason is crystal clear: it’s sitting on a mountain of Bitcoin. The company, which now identifies as a Bitcoin treasury firm, reported $14.03 billion in operating income, a record-setting figure driven by crypto gains. This number shows a 7,106.4% increase from the same quarter last year, when the firm posted a $200 million operating loss. Strategy’s stock MSTR has surged by 2% after hours. According to Strategy’s official statement , this turnaround is directly tied to the company’s decision to value its crypto assets at fair market price under new accounting rules. The company also logged $10.02 billion in net income, up from a $102.6 million net loss the year prior. Diluted earnings per share reached $32.60, blowing past all historical performance. Strategy’s total Bitcoin holding stood at 628,791 BTC, bought at a cost of $46.07 billion. The average cost per coin sits around $73,277, and the company’s BTC is now worth far more than that based on current market prices. Bitcoin lifts income and updated yearly targets Phong Le, Strategy’s President and CEO, confirmed the numbers are a direct result of the firm’s aggressive crypto accumulation. “We expanded our bitcoin holdings to 628,791 bitcoins, raised over $10 billion through our ATM programs and IPOs, and saw growing institutional and retail demand for our securities,” Phong said. He added that Strategy’s Bitcoin per Share (BPS) climbed 25% year-to-date, prompting the firm to revise its BTC Yield target from 25% to 30%, and its BTC $ Gain projection from $15 billion to $20 billion by year’s end. He explained that fair value gains from Bitcoin pushed Q2 operating income to $14 billion and that the firm expects $34 billion in operating income and $24 billion in net income for the full year. The company is also forecasting $80 in EPS, predicting that Bitcoin reaches $150,000 by December. The crypto gain for Q2 alone stood at $9.5 billion, with the company holding 597,325 bitcoin as of June 30. These were valued at $64.4 billion, with a cost basis of $42.4 billion. An additional 31,466 BTC was acquired between July 1 and July 29. Strategy said it booked a $14 billion fair value gain in Q2, compared to a $180 million impairment loss using the old cost-based accounting system last year. Capital programs boost liquidity for Bitcoin buys Strategy brought in over $10.5 billion in fresh cash in Q2 and July through stock sales, with nearly half of it raised via its common stock ATM program. The company sold 14.2 million shares between April and June, raising $5.2 billion, and another 2.4 million shares in July for $1.1 billion. As of July 29, there’s still $17 billion worth of shares that can be sold under this program. The firm also leaned heavily on four preferred stock instruments: STRK, STRF, STRD, and STRC. It raised $446.9 million from selling STRK shares in Q2 and another $71.8 million in July. For STRF, the numbers were $163.1 million in Q2 and $55.8 million in July. The IPO of STRD in May pulled in $979.7 million, and another $17.9 million came in through the STRD ATM in July. In total, the STRD ATM still has $4.2 billion left unissued. Then in July, the company launched STRC and raised $2.5 billion through its IPO. Outside of crypto, Strategy’s software business reported $114.5 million in total revenue for Q2, a 2.7% increase from last year. The biggest growth came from subscription services, which climbed 69.5% year-over-year to $40.8 million. Gross profit for the quarter was $78.7 million, giving the segment a 68.8% gross margin, slightly below last year’s 72.2%. Strategy closed Q2 with $50.1 million in cash, up from $38.1 million at the end of 2024. For the rest of 2025, Strategy said it expects to hit its revised Bitcoin goals through a mix of preferred stock offerings and common stock issuance, guided by mNAV thresholds. The company said this approach would grow its bitcoin wallet without exposing shareholders to unnecessary dilution. Strategy also noted that because of its large crypto holdings and the use of fair value accounting, its earnings are highly sensitive to Bitcoin’s market price. The firm closed by stating it will not update its guidance unless required by law.

2025-07-31T21:00:07,"Bitcoin Sees Rising New Investor Dominance, Old Holders Yet To Capitulate","As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to consolidate slightly below the $120,000 level, the dominance of new investors is steadily rising. However, on-chain data shows that BTC is still far from overheating, suggesting the premier cryptocurrency may have more room to run before a significant correction sets in. Bitcoin May Still Have Some Room To Run According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor AxelAdlerJr, new investor dominance in Bitcoin is gradually increasing – currently hovering around 30%, which is only halfway to the historical “overheated” threshold. Related Reading: Bitcoin Overheating Signals Easing – Is A Second-Half Rally Ahead? The analyst shared the following chart, which highlights two past instances – marked in orange – when new investor dominance reached overheated levels and coincided with BTC local price tops. The first instance occurred in March 2024 when the metric hit 64%, and the second in December 2024 when it peaked at 72%. In both cases, BTC experienced a significant pullback, leading to the formation of local bottoms. Notably, as the influx of new liquidity dried up during these phases, long-term holders began actively taking profits. This added further pressure on BTC’s price. Currently, while new investor dominance is trending higher, it remains well below the euphoria zone – typically between 60% and 70% – suggesting more upside potential in BTC’s bullish momentum before exhaustion. Meanwhile, older holders continue to sell moderately. The chart indicates a coefficient of 0.3, showing that the supply of three-year-old BTC is still absorbing fresh demand without sharp disruptions. From a long-term perspective, the market remains balanced, and the risk of large-scale capitulation from veteran wallets appears low. AxelAdlerJr concluded: If the indicator’s growth accelerates and approaches the historical corridor of 0.6-0.7, one should expect intensified profit-taking and, consequently, a correction. For now, the supply/demand structure remains in a healthy late bull cycle phase, when new money is coming in but old players have not yet transitioned to mass selling. Is BTC Price About To Stall? While the data above suggests that Bitcoin still has room to grow, other indicators point to waning momentum. One such signal is the recent decline in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap, which has broken its long streak of positive values. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Rally Might Be Running on Fumes, Analyst Warns of August Turning Point Fellow CryptoQuant analyst ArabChain confirmed this development in their analysis. They noted that US investor enthusiasm for BTC appears to be cooling at current price levels. That said, positive macroeconomic factors – such as BTC’s historical correlation with global M2 money supply expansion – could still lead the digital asset to new all-time highs in the near term. At press time, BTC trades at $118,371, up 0.6% in the past 24 hours.
