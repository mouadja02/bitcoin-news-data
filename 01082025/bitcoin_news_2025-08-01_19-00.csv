2025-08-01T16:55:10,"Trump Threatens India With Additional Tariffs Over BRICS Membership, Claims Economic Alliance Is an ‚ÄòAttack on the Dollar‚Äô","US President Donald Trump has threatened to slap an additional ‚Äúpenalty‚Äù on India due to the country‚Äôs involvement in the BRICS economic alliance. Trump took to Truth Social on Wednesday to announce a 25% tariff on Indian goods to balance out a trade deficit with the South Asian nation. He also said India would pay an additional ‚Äúpenalty‚Äù due to its relationship with Russia, later adding in a press conference that he plans to add the unspecified levy in part due to the country‚Äôs membership in BRICS. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre negotiating right now ‚Äì and it‚Äôs also BRICS. They have BRICS, which is basically a group of countries that are anti the United States, and India is a member of that, if you can believe it. It‚Äôs an attack on the dollar, and we‚Äôre not going to let anybody attack the dollar, so it‚Äôs partially BRICS and partially the trade situation, this deficit.‚Äù BRICS held its first summit in 2009 and was originally known as BRIC, representing its four founding members: Brazil, Russia, India, and China. The acronym became BRICS after South Africa joined the group in 2010. In 2024, it expanded membership to other nations, including Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates. Indonesia joined in early 2025. Brazil, the current president of the group, also claims that Saudi Arabia is part of the bloc, but the Middle Eastern country has reportedly eschewed formal membership in the intercontinental economic alliance to avoid antagonizing the US. The bloc also includes 10 ‚Äúpartner countries,‚Äù including Belarus, Bolivia, Kazakhstan, Cuba, Malaysia, Nigeria, Thailand, Uganda, Uzbekistan and Vietnam. Partner countries aren‚Äôt full-fledged members but are invited to participate in the BRICS summit and can endorse the alliance‚Äôs declarations. Brazil says current BRICS priorities include ‚Äúfacilitating economic transactions between bloc countries, such as the use of local currencies; the development of international payment platforms; cooperation in government procurement; and the promotion of trade facilitation measures, among others.‚Äù In 2023, the alliance reportedly began working on creating a common currency backed by gold and potentially additional precious metals and assets to circumvent international reliance on the US dollar, though officials from several of the bloc‚Äôs member countries claimed earlier this year that they weren‚Äôt pushing for de-dollarization.

2025-08-01T16:46:02,"Ethereum Price Prediction: $5.4 Billion in ETF Inflows ‚Äì Big Institutions Are Buying ETH Fast","The Ethereum price has plunged 6% in the past 24 hours, dropping to $3,625 after President Donald Trump announced sweeping new tariffs , including a 35% duty on Canadian imports. The move rattled global markets and disrupted recent crypto momentum. ETH is now down 1% over the past week but remains up 48% in the last 30 days and 14.5% over the past year. While the tariff news has paused Ethereum‚Äôs rally, its medium-term outlook remains strong. Institutional demand continues to rise, with Ethereum ETFs pulling in $5.38 billion in inflows over the past 19 days. This matches their best-ever streak and supports a very bullish long-term Ethereum price prediction . Ethereum Price Prediction: $5.4 Billion in ETF Inflows ‚Äì Big Institutions Are Buying ETH Fast While the introduction of tariffs has spooked the markets, the past couple of weeks have been very productive for Ethereum, which has seen massive inflows from institutions. Data from the Block shows that ETH ETFs have attracted $5.38 billion in net inflows since July 3 , which has been the major factor in Ethereum‚Äôs recent gains. The past week has also been particularly strong for Ethereum ETFs, which in the seven days to July 28 saw $1.6 billion in inflows , compared to $175 million in outflows for Bitcoin. WOWW!!! ETHEREUM SPOT ETFS SAW $5.41B IN NET INFLOWS IN JULY ALONE. EXCEEDING THE $4.21B TOTAL FROM ALL PREVIOUS MONTHS COMBINED SINCE LAUNCH. pic.twitter.com/njh6dqG56s ‚Äî Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) July 30, 2025 While inflows have slowed down today amid the market‚Äôs correction, it‚Äôs clear that institutions have finally discovered Ethereum, which had been in an underpriced position for much of this year. However, yesterday witnessed a very modest inflow total for ETH ETFs, at around $20 million, so it seems as though there may be a slowdown over the next few days. As shown in the chart, Ethereum appears to be entering a healthy consolidation phase after its recent rally, with technical indicators suggesting a short-term correction may still be in play. The RSI has cooled to around 45.64 , down from its overbought peak near 80 in mid-July, indicating that bullish momentum has faded but not reversed entirely. A dip toward the 40 level could mark a local bottom before renewed buying interest kicks in. Meanwhile, the MACD histogram is also weakening, reflecting a slowdown in upward momentum and supporting the case for a pullback. Based on the current structure, Ethereum may retest support around the $3,200 to $3,400 zone , which aligns with the rising trendline visible on the chart. If that level holds, Ethereum could rebound and climb toward the $4,000‚Äì$4,200 range by the end of August. Looking further out, sustained ETF inflows and macro tailwinds could help ETH push toward $5,000 by year-end, with a possible rally to $6,000 in early 2026 if the uptrend continues. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Pushes to $6.3 Million As Excitement for Layer Two Project Grows As strong as Ethereum is likely to remain for the foreseeable future, traders may want to consider diversifying their portfolios into newer tokens, since these can show more upwards volatility. This is particularly the case with recently launched and presale coins, the latter of which can often rally hard when listing for the first time, especially when their sales have been big. One coin enjoying a big sale right now is Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), a layer-two network for Bitcoin that has now raised $6.3 million in its ICO. Making use of Solana‚Äôs Virtual Machine (SVM) and zero-knowledge rollups, Bitcoin Hyper is aiming to become an ultra-fast sidechain that will help tap into the enormous value of the Bitcoin network. It will offer lower fees and faster confirmation times to Bitcoin holders, who can instantly bridge their BTC to the L2‚Äôs network. As an L2, Bitcoin Hyper will develop an ecosystem of DeFi apps and DEXes, so that traders can use their Bitcoin to make even more profits. Its native token, HYPER, will have a max supply of 21 billion, and holders of the coin will be able to stake the token, earning themselves passive income. They can buy it now, as part of its presale, by going to the Bitcoin Hyper website , where it currently costs $0.012475. This price will rise later today, so interested parties should act sooner rather than later.

2025-08-01T16:30:01,"Bitcoin Advanced Sentiment Index Reaches Bearish Levels: Futures Traders Show Caution","Bitcoin has broken down from the two-week consolidation range that held the market between $115,724 and $122,077, reaching a new local low near $114,000. The drop confirms a shift in short-term momentum, putting bulls on the defensive. The $117,000 level‚Äîpreviously a key support zone‚Äînow serves as the immediate resistance that must be reclaimed to signal a possible reversal. Related Reading: Bitcoin New Investor Dominance Rises ‚Äì No Signs of Mass Profit-Taking Yet The breakdown comes at a critical time, as sentiment across the market begins to shift. According to fresh data from CryptoQuant, futures sentiment turned bearish today, falling sharply before bouncing back slightly to 48%. While still close to neutral, any reading below 50% signals bearish dominance in positioning. This adds pressure to an already fragile technical structure and suggests traders are bracing for more downside. Unless bulls can recover $117K quickly and close with strength, Bitcoin risks entering a deeper correction phase. With long-term support levels still intact, the broader bull trend remains in place‚Äîbut this breakdown marks the first significant loss of momentum in weeks. The coming sessions will be critical in determining whether this is just a shakeout or the start of a larger trend reversal. Bitcoin Advanced Sentiment Index Signals Rising Bearish Pressure Top analyst Axel Adler has shared new insights into the Bitcoin Advanced Sentiment Index, a key metric used to gauge futures market positioning and broader investor mood. According to Adler, the index recently dropped to 40%‚Äîa sharp decline that reflected growing risk aversion and bearish positioning. Although the metric has since rebounded to 48%, it remains below the critical 50% threshold, which separates bullish from bearish territory. This rebound signals a temporary pause in negative sentiment, but the broader trend shows a shift from bullish caution to bearish fear. Adler notes that as long as the index remains below 50%, the market lacks the confidence needed to sustain upward momentum. Traders are growing increasingly defensive, reducing long exposure and bracing for further downside. If momentum continues to deteriorate, BTC could test the $112,000 level‚Äîthe previous all-time high set in May. This zone may act as psychological and technical support, but failure to hold it could trigger a deeper correction. With the Advanced Sentiment Index stuck in bearish territory and price action weakening, the market appears to be entering a riskier phase. While this doesn‚Äôt yet signal a full trend reversal, it does reflect growing uncertainty. Until sentiment and price reclaim higher ground, caution is warranted. The next move will likely depend on whether bulls can defend $112K‚Äîor if bears gain full control of the trend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Heat Macro Phase Signals Market Sits Between Accumulation And Distribution BTC Loses Key Support After Breakdown Bitcoin has officially broken down from its two-week consolidation range, losing the critical $115,724 support level highlighted in the chart. The price reached a new local low at $114,116 before recovering slightly to the $115,100 zone, where it‚Äôs currently attempting to find footing. This marks a significant shift in momentum, as bulls failed to defend the lower boundary of the range, which held firm throughout July. The 12-hour chart shows rising volume accompanying this breakdown, adding weight to the bearish move. BTC now trades below the 50-day SMA ($116,981), confirming weakness in short-term structure. The next major support sits around $112,000‚Äîthe prior all-time high set in May‚Äîwhich could act as a psychological and technical floor.

2025-08-01T16:24:35,"FCA to Unlock Crypto ETNs for UK Retail Investors in Major Policy Shift","The UK‚Äôs financial watchdog is preparing to lift restrictions on crypto exchange-traded notes (cETNs) for everyday investors, expanding access beyond institutional players for the first time. On Friday, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced it will soon allow retail investors in the UK to buy and trade crypto ETNs, a financial product previously available only to institutional investors. The regulator said the decision reflects the growing mainstream adoption and understanding of crypto-backed financial instruments.In a public statement , David Geale, Executive Director of Payments and Digital Finance at the FCA, noted that the market has changed since retail access to cETNs was restricted. He said that greater transparency and oversight now make it possible to give consumers more options, without compromising essential protections.A Move Toward Global HarmonizationWith this policy update, the UK joins countries like the United States, Canada, Hong Kong, and members of the European Union in opening up crypto-linked investment options to non-professional traders. However, only crypto ETNs listed on recognized investment exchanges (RIEs) approved by the FCA will qualify for retail access.Unlike spot crypto ETFs in the U.S., which hold actual digital assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum, crypto ETNs do not. Instead, they are structured as debt obligations. Rather than owning the asset itself, the issuer promises to deliver returns that closely track the asset‚Äôs price, minus any associated costs. As a result, ETNs offer a way to gain exposure without directly holding the crypto.Risk Warnings and Regulatory SafeguardsWhile the FCA's decision introduces new opportunities for everyday investors, the agency has emphasized the need for caution. Crypto ETNs will not be covered under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), meaning consumers won‚Äôt have protection in the event of issuer failure.Firms selling these products must comply with the FCA‚Äôs Consumer Duty rules. This means they must ensure that marketing and product design serve the best interests of customers. Additionally, financial promotion rules will remain in force, requiring clear, non-misleading disclosures about the risks involved.Crypto Derivatives Ban RemainsDespite the updated stance on crypto ETNs, the FCA has reaffirmed its ban on retail trading of crypto derivatives, citing high risk and market volatility. The agency stated that it will continue to monitor the space and adjust its approach to high-risk products when necessary.Over the years, the FCA has gradually eased its hardline stance on digital assets . Since January 2021, it has barred retail access to both crypto ETNs and derivatives. In March 2024, it began allowing professional investors to access regulated cETNs listed on UK exchanges. Among these are products launched on the London Stock Exchange by 21Shares, WisdomTree, and Invesco.While these products attracted modest trading volumes, analysts have predicted that retail access could significantly boost interest and liquidity.¬†Broader Crypto Oversight in the WorksThe UK government seeks to make the country a global hub for crypto innovation, and the FCA is playing a central role in this strategy. To support this effort, a comprehensive regulatory framework covering stablecoins, staking, lending, custody, and trading platforms is currently under consultation. Its implementation will be by 2026.Notably, the FCA has stated that the rollout for retail access to crypto ETNs will be by October this year.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/08/01/fca-to-unlock-crypto-etns-for-uk-retail-investors-in-major-policy-shift/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=fca-to-unlock-crypto-etns-for-uk-retail-investors-in-major-policy-shift,"BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|ASIA|BTC","Market",cryptocompare

Notably, STRC represents the newest addition to MicroStrategy‚Äôs expanding portfolio of perpetual preferred securities designed to fund Bitcoin acquisitions. The series includes Strike (STRK), a convertible instrument with an 8% fixed dividend; Strife (STRF), a non-convertible option featuring a 10% cumulative yield; and Stride (STRD), which distributes a 10% non-cumulative dividend. This strategic positioning coincides with MicroStrategy‚Äôs announcement of record quarterly earnings totaling $10 billion , primarily fueled by Bitcoin‚Äôs appreciation from $77,000 in Q1 to above $111,000 in Q2. The Virginia-headquartered corporation, previously operating as MicroStrategy, established the blueprint for corporate Bitcoin treasury adoption and currently maintains 628,791 BTC valued at over $72.6 billion, representing approximately 3% of Bitcoin‚Äôs total supply. Source: Saylor/X MicroStrategy‚Äôs retirement plan initiative aligns with broader momentum toward incorporating Bitcoin into 401(k) investment options. U.S Government Greenlights Bitcoin-Backed Retirement Plans in Crypto 401(k)s Policy Change Notably, the U.S. Department of Labor withdrew its 2022 guidance discouraging cryptocurrency inclusion in workplace 401(k) programs this July. This regulatory reversal is expected to rekindle enthusiasm for cryptocurrency investment vehicles within retirement and mortgage savings frameworks. Similarly, Bitcoin adoption in retirement portfolios appears to be accelerating across multiple fronts. In May 2024, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB), America‚Äôs ninth-largest pension fund, allocated $99 million to Bitcoin purchases, while Florida‚Äôs Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis advocated for Bitcoin inclusion in the state‚Äôs pension system. International adoption is already underway, with UK retirement schemes dedicating up to 3% of their portfolios to Bitcoin , anticipating superior returns for beneficiaries. These pension investments received guidance from Cartwright, a firm specializing in defined benefit scheme management that provides employees with guaranteed monthly retirement income based on service duration and salary levels. Performance data indicates that Cartwright-managed pension fund Bitcoin investments have generated over 60% returns in less than twelve months, significantly outpacing traditional assets, including bonds, gold, and the S&P 500. Cartwright Pension Trusts is seeing rising interest from its clients after helping a UK pension fund allocate 3% to Bitcoin in 2024, yielding a 60% in November 2024‚Äîand according to Nasri, it secured a 60% return on investment in under 12 months pic.twitter.com/dhgIuST0Yi ‚Äî The Crypto Utility Guy (@UtilityGuy7) July 2, 2025 Cartwright has also published specialized research targeting corporate treasurers, defined benefit administrators, and institutional investors, focusing on Bitcoin‚Äôs practical applications, volatility characteristics, and expanding macroeconomic significance.

On Thursday, five dormant miner wallets from 2010 transferred 250 BTC, valued at nearly $29.6 million, after 15.3 years of inactivity, according to Arkham Intelligence. These wallets were part of Bitcoin‚Äôs earliest mining era, each receiving a 50 BTC reward when the asset was worth just $0.003 per coin. 5 dormant miner wallets wake up after 15 years! 250 #BTC ($29.6M) transferred out just 1 hour ago Each wallet earned 50 BTC from mining on Apr 26, 2010 #Bitcoin #CryptoNews #BTC #Crypto #Investing #CryptoMarket pic.twitter.com/F6fjTCpaPV ‚Äî Crypto News Hunters (@CryptoNewsHntrs) July 31, 2025 Back then, the cost of mining a block was measured in cents. Consumer-grade CPUs performed hashing operations using about 95 watts of power, and U.S. residential electricity averaged 11.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. Mining was more about luck and access than efficiency. Fast-forward to 2025, and those same coins now represent a life-changing windfall. The original ‚Äú1‚Äù prefix wallet addresses have now moved their BTC into newer ‚Äúbc1q‚Äù SegWit addresses, an upgrade that enhances transaction efficiency and error handling. Analysts from Lookonchain and Spotonchain suggest these moves may reflect shifting custody strategies rather than immediate selling intent. Supply-Side Pressure or Just Spring Cleaning? This isn‚Äôt an isolated incident. July has seen a wave of Satoshi-era wallets awaken, transferring thousands of BTC amid rising institutional accumulation and retail speculation. So far, the market has digested these supply-side jolts relatively well. Bitcoin remains up 27% year-to-date, peaking at $118,480, just 4% below its all-time high of $122,838. But what‚Äôs driving these wallet awakenings? Some analysts see them as a way for long-term holders to shift funds into secure custody or to capitalize on Bitcoin‚Äôs recent strength. Others fear these could foreshadow future sell-offs, especially if market sentiment sours or macro uncertainty increases. While the short-term price impact has been muted, the sudden movement of old coins often precedes volatility. Traders are keeping a close watch on wallet activity, especially in periods of low liquidity, where whale movements can disproportionately affect price. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Price Outlook: Bearish Momentum Builds From a technical perspective, Bitcoin price prediction is showing signs of exhaustion. BTC has broken below the symmetrical triangle that confined price action for much of July, as well as key support at $116,872 and the 50-SMA ($117,713). Bitcoin Price Chart ‚Äì Source: Tradingview Current Price: $115,295 Key Supports: $114,563, $112,901, $110,587 Resistance Levels: $116,800, $117,713, $118,878 RSI: 32 (approaching oversold) The ‚Äúthree black crows‚Äù candlestick pattern has appeared on the 4H chart, signaling strong bearish sentiment. Meanwhile, the RSI hovers below 35 with no visible bullish divergence, confirming fading momentum. Trade Idea: If BTC fails to reclaim $117,000, traders may consider a short entry near $116,000‚Äì$116,500, with a stop-loss above $118,800 and targets near $114,500 and $112,900. Risk remains elevated due to potential fakeouts, so wait for confirmation on any retest of broken support. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Over $6M as Price Rise Nears Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), has raised over $6 million in its public presale, with $6,098,717 out of a $7,004,929 target.

2025-08-01T16:02:36,"SEC Chair Paul Atkins‚Äô ‚ÄòProject Crypto‚Äô Sets the Stage for the Next Cryptos to Explode","Yesterday, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Paul Atkins announced ‚ÄòProject Crypto‚Äô ‚Äì a bold new initiative he describes as ‚Äòthe SEC‚Äôs north star in aiding President Trump in his historic efforts to make America the crypto capital of the world.‚Äô Ultimately, it aims to modernize US financial regulations and bring crypto innovation onshore by establishing clear, supportive rules for digital assets. In fact, it‚Äôs already creating a more favorable crypto environment, as evidenced by $BTC‚Äôs trading volume surging by over 28% to $90B since the news broke. And when the market leader ‚Äì currently trading near $115K ‚Äì performs well, smaller coins often follow. Because of this, now might be the perfect time to look at the next cryptos to explode before their prices likely soar. SEC Plans to Reform Securities Law & Tokenized Assets Project Crypto is a landmark initiative from the US SEC, spearheaded by Atkins and supported by Commissioner Hester Peirce. It‚Äôs meant to update outdated securities laws to favor blockchain innovation. And such regulatory clarity has been a long time coming. Major crypto companies ‚Äì including Ripple , Coinbase , Binance and Kraken ‚Äì have all faced SEC lawsuits over allegedly offering or facilitating the trade of unregistered securities. These lawsuits, however, arose under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler. An aggressive enforcement-first approach in the absence of clear crypto rules characterized his tenure. ‚ÄòCrypto President‚Äô Donald Trump was quick to replace him to promote a more supportive US crypto market under new SEC leadership. And that‚Äôs exactly what‚Äôs happening now. Beyond establishing clear categories for securities, stablecoins, and collectibles, another benefit mentioned in the Project Crypto speech includes enabling ‚Äòsuper apps‚Äô to combine trading, custody, and staking under a single license. Additionally, Atkins mentioned supporting tokenized securities and stablecoins under frameworks like the GENIUS Act . Crypto firms are already aligning themselves with this vision. Coinbase, for instance, is preparing to launch ‚Äò Everything Exchange .‚Äô Once launched to US users in the coming months, it promises to support tokenized stocks, crypto assets, derivatives, prediction markets, and early-stage tokens. Interestingly, the announcement comes on the heels of Trump‚Äôs Working Group on Digital Assets unveiling a comprehensive crypto report yesterday. Dubbed ‚Äò Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology ,‚Äô the blueprint expresses the US‚Äôs desire to lead global crypto innovation through clear rules, tax reform, and supportive regulation. Each of these documents signify a turning point for crypto projects, as they should soon be able to operate in a transparent, well-regulated environment that fosters growth. It‚Äôs also likely to attract more mainstream investors, further indicating a bright future for potentially top cryptocurrencies to buy now , like Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , Snorter Token ($SNORT) , and LUKSO ($LYX) ‚Äì especially when exploring their unique use cases. 1. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) ‚Äì Unlock First Dibs on Crypto Presales & Low Gas Fees As US crypto regulations loosen and the industry attracts more attention, there might not be a better time to buy Best Wallet Token ($BEST) . The reason is that it‚Äôs the backbone of the Best Wallet app , a non-custodial crypto wallet that‚Äôs the first of its kind to give direct access to the best crypto presales . This alone is a major benefit. It gives you easy access to new crypto projects while their prices are still low-cap, before they reach top crypto exchanges and their prices likely increase. But it‚Äôs not just the newest cryptos that it supports. You can buy, sell, and manage over 1,000 digital assets directly on the mobile app, including meme coins like $SHIB and $DOGE and major currencies like $BTC and $ETH. And what better time to start investing in such coins than now? It supports major chains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon. Soon, however, it will support over 60 networks, allowing you to explore more cross-chain opportunities. And it doesn‚Äôt stop there. The project‚Äôs roadmap has many exciting new features, from Best Card (its own crypto debit card) to an NFT gallery and market intelligence analytics. By purchasing $BEST , you can also enjoy lower gas fees, governance rights, and staking rewards (currently at a 94% APY). $BEST is available on presale for just $0.025415. But act fast; its upcoming new developments are poised to push its price to $0.072 (a whopping 183% increase!). 2. Snorter Token ($SNORT) ‚Äì Enjoy Low Fees on Novel Multi-Chain Telegram Trading Bot Snorter Token ($SNORT) is the backbone of Snorter Bot, a novel Telegram-trading app set to launch this quarter. And it has already raised over $2.6M on presale as a consequence. And its debut possibly couldn‚Äôt arrive at a better time. As the crypto market heats up with pro-crypto regulations, it‚Äôs time to find more effective ways to profit from the surge. Snorter Bot allows you to do exactly that. It provides automated sniping, limit orders, copy trading, and quick swaps through its sleek interface. With multi-chain support and ultra-low fees (the lowest on Solana at just 0.85%), it‚Äôs built to give you an edge in the often volatile market. You can also relax knowing that security is a top priority. It‚Äôs designed with MEV protection and includes scam-detection tools that flag and block honeypots and rug pulls to avoid common and costly mistakes. Within the Snorter Bot ecosystem, $SNORT grants access to premium features, advanced analytics, DAO voting rights, and staking rewards at a 161% APY (at the time of writing). You can buy $SNORT on presale for just $0.0999. Investor curiosity is anticipated to catapult its price to $0.94 this year, making now a good time to join for possible returns surpassing 841%. 3. LUKSO ($LYX) ‚Äì Powers a Blockchain Network Built for the Creator Economy $LYX is the native token of LUKSO, a cutting-edge blockchain built for the ‚Äònew digital lifestyle.‚ÄôCreated by Fabian Vogelsteller (the former Ethereum developer behind ERC20, ERC725, and web3.js), it aims to bridge industries like fashion, gaming, social media, and design. Its ultimate aim is for these sectors to fully embrace blockchain tech. It does this by providing them with the necessary tools to build decentralized identities, manage digital assets, and foster tokenized communities. And given that Project Crypto emphasized clear guidelines for tokenized assets, LUKSO is perfectly positioned to thrive from this regulatory direction. It might even be the reason that its native token, $LYX, has nearly doubled in price since Atkins unveiled his Project Crypto speech yesterday. Like $ETH on Ethereum, $LYX is used to pay gas fees on the LUKSO network. Anytime you interact with smart contracts on the platform or update your profile, you pay in $LYX. $LYX is currently available on top crypto exchanges ‚Äì like MEXC ‚Äì for just $1.20. Notably, its trading volume has spiked by over 346% to $3.81M since yesterday, signaling that now‚Äôs a strategic entry point before even broader adoption takes hold. Verdict ‚Äì New US Crypto Era to Send Top Cryptos Flying From the SEC‚Äôs unveiling of Project Crypto, Trump‚Äôs Working Group on Digital Assets releasing the crypto report, and Coinbase‚Äôs upcoming launch, one thing‚Äôs clear: the US is determined to lead DeFi to new heights. It‚Äôs precisely the news that ambitious projects like $BEST , $SNORT , and $LYX have been waiting for. All three are building exactly what the new US crypto era is calling for ‚Äì easy access to new tokens, rising on-chain trading tools, and tokenized assets. This makes them hot picks right now with high profit potential. However, this isn‚Äôt investment advice. Always do your own research and never invest more than you‚Äôre willing to lose.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/next-cryptos-to-explode-alongside-project-crypto/,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK|AIRDROP|XLM|LTC|CFX|FLOKI|MX|COMMODITY|ONDO|ENA|GALA|BTG|MATIC|LINK","Crypto News",cryptocompare
2025-08-01T16:00:12,"Bitcoin to Exchanges: Urgent Warning as 21,000 BTC Floods Markets","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin to Exchanges: Urgent Warning as 21,000 BTC Floods Markets The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with a recent development that has caught the attention of many market observers. A significant amount of Bitcoin, specifically 21,400 BTC, has been sent to exchanges within the past 24 hours. This notable movement, highlighted by CryptoQuant contributor J.A. Maartunn on X, involves Bitcoin held by short-term holders. When such large volumes of Bitcoin to exchanges occur, it is often interpreted as a potential indicator of selling pressure. What does this mean for the market, and how should investors react? What Does This Significant Bitcoin to Exchanges Movement Signify? In the dynamic realm of cryptocurrency, on-chain data provides valuable insights into market sentiment and potential future price movements. The transfer of a substantial amount of Bitcoin to exchanges is a key metric that analysts closely monitor. Generally, when coins are moved from private wallets to exchange platforms, it suggests that holders intend to sell, trade, or potentially use them for other purposes that require exchange liquidity. The fact that these 21,400 BTC originate from short-term holders adds another layer of interpretation. Short-term holders are typically more reactive to price fluctuations, often seeking to realize quick profits or cut losses. Unlike long-term holders, who are generally committed to holding their assets for extended periods regardless of short-term volatility, short-term holders are more prone to engage in active trading. This distinction is crucial for understanding the immediate implications of such a large influx of Bitcoin to exchanges . Holder Type Typical Holding Period Likelihood of Sending Bitcoin to Exchanges Short-Term Holders (STH) Less than 155 days High (for profit-taking or loss-cutting) Long-Term Holders (LTH) More than 155 days Low (focused on long-term appreciation) How Have Past Bitcoin to Exchanges Surges Played Out? Historically, large movements of Bitcoin to exchanges have often preceded periods of increased market volatility or price corrections. While not every deposit leads to an immediate sell-off, a significant increase in exchange balances indicates an elevated supply available for sale, which can exert downward pressure on prices if demand does not match the increased supply. For instance, during bull market peaks, large inflows can signal profit-taking by early investors. Conversely, during bearish trends, such inflows might indicate capitulation or stop-loss triggers. It is important to consider the broader market context. If the overall market sentiment is strong and there is robust buying demand, even large inflows can be absorbed without a drastic price drop. However, in a fragile market, such a substantial deposit can trigger a cascade of selling as other traders react to the perceived bearish signal. Understanding these historical patterns helps investors contextualize the current movement of Bitcoin to exchanges . Understanding Short-Term Holders: Why Are They Sending Bitcoin to Exchanges? Short-term holders, as defined by their holding period of less than 155 days, are typically more sensitive to market news, FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt), and FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). Their decision to move Bitcoin to exchanges can stem from several motivations: Profit-Taking: If Bitcoin has seen a recent price surge, short-term holders might be looking to lock in profits. Loss-Cutting: In a declining market, they might be moving their Bitcoin to exchanges to sell and minimize further losses. Arbitrage Opportunities: Traders might move Bitcoin between exchanges to capitalize on minor price differences. Reaction to News: Macroeconomic news, regulatory announcements, or even rumors can prompt short-term holders to adjust their positions quickly. Their collective actions can significantly influence short-term market dynamics, making their recent deposit of 21,400 BTC a focal point for market watchers. What are the Potential Market Impacts of Bitcoin to Exchanges? The immediate concern following a large influx of Bitcoin to exchanges is the potential for increased selling pressure. When more Bitcoin becomes readily available on exchanges, it increases the potential supply in the market. If this supply outweighs the demand, the price of Bitcoin could experience a downturn. Here are some potential impacts: Increased Volatility: The market may become more volatile as traders react to the increased supply, leading to rapid price swings. Temporary Price Correction: A significant sell-off could lead to a short-term price dip as sellers offload their holdings. Liquidity Shift: While the Bitcoin is on exchanges, it contributes to the overall liquidity, making it easier for large trades to occur, both buying and selling. Sentiment Shift: The news itself can create a bearish sentiment, prompting other holders to consider selling, even if the initial deposits do not immediately result in sales. However, it is also important to remember that not all deposits lead to immediate sales. Some Bitcoin might be moved for staking, lending, or even for setting up complex trading strategies that do not involve immediate liquidation. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights for Investors Amidst Bitcoin to Exchanges Given the recent movement of Bitcoin to exchanges , investors should approach the market with informed caution. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor On-Chain Data: Beyond just exchange inflows, keep an eye on other on-chain metrics such as stablecoin inflows (indicating potential buying power), miner outflows, and whale movements. Diversify Your Portfolio: Do not put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification across different cryptocurrencies and asset classes can help mitigate risks during volatile periods. Implement Risk Management: Consider setting stop-loss orders to protect your investments from sudden downturns. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Stay Informed: Follow reputable crypto news sources and analysts. Understand the fundamental factors driving Bitcoin‚Äôs price, not just short-term market movements. Avoid Emotional Decisions: Market fluctuations can trigger strong emotions. Base your decisions on research and a clear investment strategy, rather than fear or greed. While the influx of Bitcoin to exchanges is a notable event, it is one piece of a larger puzzle. A holistic view of market indicators and a disciplined approach are key to navigating the complexities of the cryptocurrency market. The movement of 21,400 Bitcoin from short-term holders to exchanges within 24 hours is undoubtedly a development that warrants attention from anyone involved in the crypto market. While such an event is often interpreted as a precursor to increased selling pressure and potential volatility, it is crucial to consider the broader context and other market dynamics. History shows that while these inflows can lead to price corrections, the market‚Äôs ability to absorb supply also plays a significant role. For investors, this moment serves as a reminder to remain vigilant, conduct thorough research, and employ sound risk management strategies. The crypto market is inherently volatile, and understanding the nuances of on-chain data, like the recent Bitcoin to exchanges movement, is vital for making informed decisions and navigating potential shifts effectively. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does it mean when Bitcoin is sent to exchanges? When Bitcoin is sent to exchanges, it generally means that the holder intends to sell, trade, or use the Bitcoin for activities that require it to be on an exchange platform. It increases the available supply on exchanges, which can potentially lead to increased selling pressure if not met with sufficient buying demand. Q2: Are all Bitcoin deposits to exchanges immediately sold? No, not all Bitcoin deposited to exchanges is immediately sold. While a significant portion might be intended for sale, some could be moved for arbitrage, staking, lending, or to participate in specific exchange-based trading strategies that do not involve immediate liquidation. Q3: Who are short-term Bitcoin holders? Short-term Bitcoin holders are typically defined as entities that have held their Bitcoin for less than 155 days. They are often more reactive to market fluctuations, aiming to take profits quickly or cut losses, as opposed to long-term holders who hold for extended periods. Q4: How does this Bitcoin to exchanges movement affect Bitcoin‚Äôs price? A large movement of Bitcoin to exchanges can increase the potential supply available for sale, which might exert downward pressure on Bitcoin‚Äôs price if buying demand does not keep pace. It can also increase market volatility as traders react to the perceived increase in selling potential. Q5: What should investors do in response to this news? Investors should remain informed, monitor other on-chain metrics, and consider their risk management strategies. Diversifying portfolios, setting stop-loss orders, and avoiding emotional decisions are prudent steps. It is important to view this movement as one data point among many when assessing market conditions. Did you find this article insightful?
