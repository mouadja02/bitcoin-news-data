2025-08-01T05:30:12,"Will Markets Tank Further When $5.7B Bitcoin Options Expire Today?","Around 48,600 Bitcoin options contracts will expire on Friday, August 1, and they have a notional value of roughly $5.7 billion. This one is around half of last week‚Äôs large end-of-quarter expiry event , so it is unlikely to be enough to influence spot markets, which have started to tank in the wake of Donald Trump‚Äôs trade tariff executive order. ‚ÄúInstitutions are stepping in, long-term holders are taking profits, and Ethereum‚Äôs at the center of the stablecoin shift sparked by the GENIUS Act,‚Äù commented Deribit. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week‚Äôs big batch of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 0.75, meaning that there are more calls expiring than put contracts. There is also a max pain point of $116,000, pretty close to current spot prices, which is where most losses will be made on contract expiry. Open interest (OI), or the value or number of BTC options contracts yet to expire, is highest at $140,000, which has surged to almost $3 billion at this strike price. There is also more than $2 billion OI at $120,000 strike price as the bull speculators load up on contracts. Options Expiry Alert Tomorrow, over $7B in BTC and ETH options are set to expire on Deribit. $BTC : $5.72B notional | Put/Call: 0.74 | Max Pain: $116K $ETH : $1.35B notional | Put/Call: 0.97 | Max Pain: $3,500 BTC positions are wide, but price is holding right above max‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/rHwqvBakWY ‚Äî Deribit (@DeribitOfficial) July 31, 2025 The bears in the Greeks Live group were gradually shifting stance, but still not fully convinced. ‚ÄúThe group shows clear division on market direction, with traders split between calling the bottom and expecting further downside,‚Äù they said in a weekly update. ‚ÄúKey levels being watched include $116k as critical support and $118k as potential resistance, with disagreement on whether the recent dip represents a buying opportunity or the start of a deeper correction.‚Äù The crypto derivatives provider also noted that the community expressed concern that without this institutional flow (Strategy buying 21,021 BTC), price could have easily dropped to $115,000 or lower, ‚Äúhighlighting the market‚Äôs current dependence on corporate treasury flows.‚Äù In addition to today‚Äôs batch of Bitcoin options, there are around 350,000 Ethereum contracts that are also expiring, with a notional value of $1.35 billion, a max pain point of $3,500, and a put/call ratio of 0.96. This brings Friday‚Äôs combined crypto options expiry notional value to around $7 billion. Crypto Markets Tank Crypto markets have dumped more than $100 billion over the past 24 hours in a 6% total capitalization decline to $3.86 trillion. The move was triggered by the US President unleashing a wave of tariffs before his Aug. 1 deadline. Many countries that failed to make a deal with him were facing steep tariffs, which rattled markets. Bitcoin tanked to a three-week low below $115,000 during the Friday morning Asian trading session as it clings to support levels within its rangebound channel. Ethereum fared a little better, dipping to $3,650 before rebounding to reclaim $3,700 at the time of writing. The altcoins were getting hammered as usual, with larger losses for Solana, Dogecoin, Cardano, Sui, and Chainlink.

2025-08-01T05:30:00,"Jamie Dimon Warms Up to Blockchain and Stablecoins","During the interview, Dimon made it clear that JPMorgan‚Äôs increasing involvement in the crypto space‚Äîlike plans for a deposit coin, a stablecoin expansion, and a new partnership with Coinbase‚Äîis driven by customer demand rather than personal enthusiasm. This evolving outlook is very similar to industry trends, with Visa also deepening its stablecoin integration. Visa now supports more stablecoins like USDG, PYUSD, and EURC, and new blockchains like Stellar and Avalanche. The company hopes that this will help it modernize global payments. Both companies‚Äô moves suggest that there is growing institutional interest, clearer US regulation, and a recognition that stablecoins may redefine the future of finance. JPMorgan CEO Softens Crypto Stance Jamie Dimon, the longtime CEO of JPMorgan, suggested that he made a huge shift in his stance toward digital assets during a CNBC interview on Tuesday. He openly expressed support for stablecoins and acknowledged the value of blockchain technology. While still maintaining a cautious tone, Dimon explained that the bank‚Äôs expanding crypto strategy is primarily a response to customer demand rather than personal conviction. He said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs what the customer wants, not what JPMorgan wants.‚Äù He also placed emphasis on the fact that financial innovation inevitably comes with risk, and ‚Äúthere‚Äôs never been a new financial product that didn‚Äôt entail risk.‚Äù This moderated tone is a major departure from Dimon‚Äôs comments over the years . In 2017, he famously called Bitcoin a ‚Äúfraud‚Äù and dismissed it as worse than the speculative tulip bubble of the 17th century. He even threatened to fire any trader at JPMorgan who engaged with the asset. Over time, while maintaining skepticism about Bitcoin‚Äôs use cases, particularly its role in illicit activity, Dimon increasingly acknowledged the potential of blockchain. As recently as January 2025, he reiterated concerns over Bitcoin being used for criminal activity but continued to support blockchain innovations. JPMorgan‚Äôs actions reflect this evolving outlook. In July, Dimon confirmed that the bank plans to issue a deposit coin and broader stablecoin offerings as part of its plan to better understand and compete in the digital asset space. On Wednesday, JPMorgan also announced a new partnership with Coinbase , which will allow Chase credit card holders to purchase digital assets through the platform starting this fall. Additionally, users will be able to redeem Chase Ultimate Rewards points for the USDC stablecoin. The bank is also reportedly exploring offering direct loans backed by Bitcoin as collateral, with a potential launch as early as 2026. Overall, Dimon‚Äôs gradual softening may be a combination of market realities and strategic adaptation. Visa Expands Stablecoin Support JP Morgan is not the only company taking note of the growth in stablecoins. Visa took another major step toward integrating blockchain technology into mainstream finance by expanding its stablecoin settlement platform. The payments giant announced support for three new stablecoins‚ÄîGlobal Dollar (USDG), PayPal USD (PYUSD), and Euro Coin (EURC)‚Äîalong with the integration of two additional blockchain networks, Stellar and Avalanche. This development will make it possible for users to send and receive stablecoin payments or convert them into traditional fiat currencies across a broader range of networks. It also forms part of Visa‚Äôs main goal of modernizing its financial infrastructure. Visa press release Previously, Visa supported only Circle‚Äôs USD Coin (USDC) on Ethereum and Solana. With the addition of Stellar and Avalanche, Visa is widening its scope to offer faster and more efficient cross-border payments and settlements, a feature that appeals to institutions and international businesses. Additionally, tThe move aligns with the rising institutional interest in stablecoins, which was spurred on even more by the recent passing of the GENIUS stablecoin bill in the United States. This legislation provides clearer regulatory guidelines, which prompted banks, tech companies, and retailers to explore stablecoin use cases more seriously. Visa‚Äôs expansion is also happening at a time of intensifying competition in the stablecoin sector. Mastercard, its closest rival, already tokenized 30% of its transactions and is working with crypto companies to integrate stablecoin and digital asset payment rails. Meanwhile, JPMorgan‚Äôs recent partnership with Coinbase allows Chase users to convert rewards points into USDC, which serves as great proof that traditional banking and digital assets are converging. Big-name retailers like Amazon and Walmart are also reportedly investigating the launch of proprietary stablecoins to facilitate lower-cost, instant international payments. Bank of America even teased similar ambitions, and stablecoin infrastructure is being recognized as a disruptive force in the legacy payments industry. According to Alchemy's head of engineering Noam Hurwitz , on-chain stablecoin transaction volumes have already surpassed those of Visa and Mastercard, which could potentially position stablecoins as the internet‚Äôs new default settlement layer. Visa‚Äôs latest integration suggests that the company is preparing for a future where blockchain-based assets play a central role in the global financial system.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/10293/jamie-dimon-warms-up-to-blockchain-and-stablecoins,"BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|PYUSD|BTC|SPONSORED","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

By 2028, SOL is expected to reach a new high of $666.41, driven by mainstream adoption of its dApps. Solana‚Äôs price could surpass the $1,000 mark, potentially reaching $1,543.45 or higher by 2031. Despite occasional challenges for Solana ecosystem, including network congestion and competition from other blockchain platforms, the current sentiment shows that Solana demonstrates resilience and adaptability, despite the current price fluctuations, positioning itself as a leading player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 landscape. Overall, the prevailing sentiment within the Solana community reflects the current sentiment of confidence and excitement among investors , driven by the growing interest in Solana with stakeholders eagerly anticipating the platform‚Äôs continued evolution and impact on the broader crypto ecosystem. While uncertainties persist, Solana‚Äôs innovative approach and robust infrastructure instill optimism for its future price trajectory, as indicated by the technical analysis, solana price forecast and market dominance, particularly when evaluated against momentum indicators. How high can SOL go in 2025 and beyond? Overview Cryptocurrency Solana Token SOL Price $177.55 (+0.64%) Market Cap $95.65 Billion Trading Volume 24-hour $5.66 Billion Circulating Supply 538.17 Million SOL All-time High $294.33 Jan 19, 2025 All-time Low $0.5052, May 11, 2020 24-hour High $186.49 24-hour Low $178.57 Solana price prediction: Technical analysis Sentiment Bullish 50-Day SMA $160.26 200-Day SMA $162.96 Price Prediction $388.49¬†(118.42%) F & G Index 40.85¬†(fear) Green Days 15/30 (50%) 14-Day RSI 60.54 Solana price analysis: SOL faces bearish pressure below $180 TL;DR Breakdown: Solana price analysis shows bearish pressure below $180. Resistance for SOL is at $200 Support for SOL/USD is at $180 The price analysis of Solana for July 31 shows that SOL faced resistance at $185 that triggered a decline toward $175. Solana price analysis 1-day chart: SOL declines below $180 Solana faced selling pressure as buyers defended immediate Fib levels. Current technical suggests a trend correction that pushed the price below $180. Currently, the price is holding momentum around $177, as the bears seek a breakdown towards the $170 level. SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 52.6, showing that the retracement has put the trend back in the healthy zone but shows room for further volatility across the daily charts. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line declines rapidly, suggesting rising selling pressure. Additionally, the MACD candles show rising bearish momentum in the market. SOL/USD 4-hour price chart: Bearish momentum continues to challenge buyers The 4-hour chart for Solana revealed a steady decline as the bears aimed to hold below the $180 price level. The recent rejection plunged the SOL price toward $175 support line. SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview From a technical perspective, the MACD shows rising bearish momentum at -0.84, with the indicator showing rising selling demand with recent candles. This suggests that SOL is yet to find a support at the $180 level. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) dropped to 40.8, indicating that Solana still has room for further movement in the downward direction across the short term and SOL needs to defend the $175 level to prevent a breakdown towards $170. Solana technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $‚ÄØ157.38 BUY SMA 5 $‚ÄØ173.42 BUY SMA 10 $‚ÄØ183.01 SELL SMA 21 $‚ÄØ177.18 BUY SMA 50 $‚ÄØ161.78 BUY SMA 100 $‚ÄØ161.66 BUY SMA 200 $‚ÄØ154.20 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $‚ÄØ173.28 BUY EMA 5 $‚ÄØ167.10 BUY EMA 10 $‚ÄØ157.82 BUY EMA 21 $‚ÄØ147.55 BUY EMA 50 $‚ÄØ147.13 BUY EMA 100 $‚ÄØ159.64 BUY EMA 200 $‚ÄØ167.68 BUY What to expect from Solana price analysis? SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview The Solana price analysis across the daily and 1-hour chart indicates minor resistance around $190. The chart suggests a correction before the bulls can continue upwards. As the price falls back towards $185, SOL can be expected to hold at $180, a key level that has been defended previously. However, if the price falls below the $175 level, SOL may fall to the $168 mark. Is SOL a good investment? Solana is a high-performance blockchain platform known for its scalability and speed, boasting a substantial Total Value Locked ( TVL ). The network continues to hit key development milestones. Despite a challenging month, price predictions indicate a more positive outlook, suggesting the potential for future growth. Why is SOL down? As bulls failed to push the SOL price above $190 resistance, it triggered a decline toward the low of $175 level. Currently, price holds above $175 but the mounting bearish pressure might make that consolidation short-lived. What is Solana going to be worth in 2025? The Solana (SOL) price prediction for 2025 suggests a minimum value of $150.06 with an average price of $331.81. The price could reach a maximum of $367.80 during the year. Will SOL reach $1,000? The price forecasts indicate that SOL could reach the $1000 mark by 2030. Given the bullish scenario and the projected positive market sentiment and growth trend, SOL might reach $1,000 within the next five years. Can Solana reach $5,000? Reaching $5,000 is plausible but would likely take several years beyond the current forecast period. However, a snowball in the asset‚Äôs adoption might bring the moment sooner. Does SOL have a good long-term future? Yes, Solana has a good long-term future, with a promising market capitalization and exciting potential roi due to its high scalability, low transaction costs, robust ecosystem, and increasing institutional interest. Its growing adoption, strong developer community, and strategic partnerships further enhance Solana‚Äôs forecast of its potential for sustained growth.

Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth¬†with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana‚Äôs (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solana-price-prediction/,"SOL|TRADING|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET","Crypto Price Predictions|Solana",cryptocompare

2025-08-01T05:00:10,"Crypto Leverage Under Fire: South Korea Set to Tighten Lending Rules","South Korean financial regulators are preparing new guidelines to address cryptocurrency lending services, particularly those offering high leverage to retail investors. The initiative, announced on Thursday, comes amid growing concerns about investor protection and potential risks tied to volatile market conditions. According to reports from Yonhap News Agency (YNA), the Financial Services Commission (FSC) and Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) have established a joint task force to develop a regulatory framework targeting crypto lending practices. The move follows recent offerings by major domestic exchanges, such as Bithumb and Upbit, which introduced high-risk lending options allowing users to borrow significant amounts relative to their collateral. Joint Task Force to Draft New Lending Guidelines The task force will include members from the FSC, FSS, and the Digital Asset eXchange Alliance (DAXA), a self-regulatory body composed of five leading South Korean exchanges: Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and Gopax. The primary goal of the group is to establish clear rules governing leveraged lending products, which have recently seen increased adoption without standardized investor safeguards. As noted in YNA‚Äôs report, Bithumb has allowed users to borrow up to four times their deposited collateral, while Upbit provided loans amounting to 80% of users‚Äô asset values. Regulators fear that such high leverage could expose retail investors to rapid and severe losses during market swings. The forthcoming guidelines are expected to address leverage limits, asset and user eligibility criteria, mandatory risk disclosures, and enhanced transparency for digital asset lending activities. The regulators have also urged crypto exchanges to proactively review services that pose high risk or lack legal clarity. This includes offerings with excessive leverage and those enabling fiat-based lending , which may fall into regulatory grey areas. According to the FSC, the goal is to create a structured approach that can serve as a foundation for broader digital asset legislation in the future. Part of a Broader Push for Crypto Oversight The establishment of the lending task force aligns with South Korea‚Äôs wider efforts to strengthen oversight in the digital asset sector. Earlier this year, the Bank of Korea announced the formation of a Virtual Asset Team by integrating its central bank digital currency (CBDC) research division with a broader mandate to monitor stablecoins and other crypto-related developments. The team will collaborate with government agencies during the upcoming legislative process for cryptocurrencies. Global regulators have also been paying closer attention to crypto lending following high-profile collapses of platforms like Celsius and BlockFi in 2022, which left many investors facing significant losses. South Korea‚Äôs proposed rules aim to prevent similar events by setting clearer boundaries on lending practices within the country‚Äôs growing digital asset market. The draft guidelines are expected to be released next month, with industry stakeholders anticipating stricter requirements on how crypto exchanges manage leveraged lending services.
