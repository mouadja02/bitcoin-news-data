2025-08-01T13:58:09,"Key Catalysts for Bitcoin's New Rise Becoming Clear, According to Crypto Financial Services Platform Matrixport! Here Are the Details","According to the latest report published by crypto financial services platform Matrixport, the key catalysts that will allow Bitcoin to enter a new bullish cycle are becoming increasingly clear. Matrixport: Key Catalysts for Bitcoin's New Uptrend Becoming Clear The report notes that despite positive developments such as strong capital inflows into Ethereum ETFs, growing institutional investor interest, and the potential approval of a staking mechanism by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), market enthusiasm has yet to fully manifest. This is supported by the fact that funding rates have only reached 15%. Historically, August and September have been among the weakest-performing periods of the year for Bitcoin, according to Matrixport analysis. Following the last US Federal Reserve (FOMC) meeting at the end of July, there are no clear policy catalysts in the market in the short term, with the next meeting scheduled for September 17. This means investors may be on the lookout and Bitcoin could trade sideways. However, the report notes that uncertainties in US fiscal policy remain a key support factor for assets like Bitcoin. In particular, former President Donald Trump's proposed $5 trillion debt limit increase plan caused the US Treasury debt stock to increase by more than 10% recently. Matrixport emphasizes that Bitcoin stands out as a hedge against such macroeconomic developments, while underlining that capital movements should be closely monitored in future pricing decisions. *This is not investment advice.

Despite consistently positive funding rates in perpetual futures markets, short-term BTC and ETH options are flashing early bearish signals, suggesting growing caution among traders amid a dip in spot prices. Key Insights: Bearish Divergence in Derivatives: Short-tenor options on both BTC and ETH have moved toward volatility premiums for out-of-the-money (OTM) puts, pointing to a bearish-to-neutral stance. This contrasts with the bullish bias seen in perpetual swaps, where funding rates have remained positive since early July across BTC, ETH, DOGE, and XRP. BTC Faces Resistance at $120K: BTC has remained range-bound between $115K–$120K, briefly touching the lower bound on July 25 after a major sell-off of 80,000 bitcoins linked to a Satoshi-era wallet. Open interest in BTC and altcoin perpetuals surged past $15.5B on the same day, underscoring heightened trading activity. ETH Holds Ground as Options Bullishness Cools: ETH continues to outperform BTC in spot markets, gaining 3.5% over the past week and hovering just below $3,800. While options volume remains strong at over $120M, the market is showing signs of cooling—implied volatility has compressed to 64%, and the skew on 7-day options has shifted to -3.6%, hinting at tempered bullishness.

2025-08-01T13:46:19,"Did the IMF Just Formally Recognize Bitcoin? Here Are the Top Cryptos to Buy in August","Sometimes it takes only a few words to mark a major policy shift. For all the attention given to recent US crypto legislation, including the GENIUS Act and CLARITY Act, the International Monetary Fund and United Nations Statistical Commission may have done just as much for crypto adoption in a couple brief sentences. The UN just published a revised version of the System of National Accounts (SNA) , which formally incorporates Bitcoin and other qualified crypto‑assets into national wealth statistics. It may not seem like much, but recognition on this level from the UN should do wonders for crypto adoption long-term. Recognizing Bitcoin as a Balance Sheet Asset (But Not GDP Contributor) The last edition of the SNA was published in 2008, before even Bitcoin had made its appearance. The emergence of a nearly $4T market in under two decades is bound to make waves, and it made sense to expect that the new SNA would account for it somehow. But the devil’s in the details, and it remained to be seen how the SNA would class Bitcoin and crypto assets. Guidance is provided on the treatment of crypto assets and non-fungible tokens. In particular, crypto assets without a corresponding liability designed to act as a general medium of exchange, such as bitcoin, are treated as non-produced non-financial assets, classified as a separate category. Crypto assets with a corresponding liability are treated as financial instruments. —System of National Accounts, International Monetary Fund and United Nations Statistical Commission The wording ‘non‑produced non-financial assets’ is significant. It allows crypto to be recorded on national balance sheets as components of sovereign wealth and institutional holdings, while still being excluded from GDP calculations. A Softer Regulatory Posture Toward Crypto The clarification marks a clear softening of the global regulatory stance toward digital assets. Historically cautious, regulators are now acknowledging the increasing macroeconomic and fiscal relevance of crypto in national economies and public ledgers. The new classifications enhance governments’ ability to track and report on institutional and sovereign crypto holdings. Countries like El Salvador, which maintain public Bitcoin reserves, can now incorporate these figures into official reporting; so will the US, as it builds out its own crypto reserves. This shift lends support to efforts in financial oversight and tax compliance, as well as simply clarifying how to manage crypto assets in international accounts. The move also touches on a separate but related trend – the revision to the SNA is part of a broader initiative to modernize economic data structures. The updated framework includes guidance on measuring digital platforms, cloud computing, and AI technologies to ensure that official statistics better reflect evolving economic realities. In the short-term, those few simple sentences should generate a number of positives for crypto: Substantive shift: Crypto gains formal recognition as a national wealth component. Policy boost: Better reporting, oversight, taxation and stability monitoring. Statistics aligned with innovation: Reinforces global accounting frameworks in the digital age. With the SNA now clarified, these cryptos could tap into the energy of a rejuvenated global market. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Better, Faster Bitcoin Layer 2 to Profit from New SNA Nothing will ever beat Bitcoin; it’s the original, the best store of value, the largest market cap. But not even Bitcoin is perfect. It can’t take advantage of the full range of blockchain technology – there’s no DeFi, no native on-chain staking, and transaction speeds are far lower than more modern chains. That’s where Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) comes in. As a planned Bitcoin Layer 2, the project leverages a Bitcoin Canonical Bridge and the architecture of the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to unlock staking, zero-knowledge proofs, and more for Bitcoin. Through the SVM, Bitcoin Hyper delivers lightning-fast transaction speeds; even swapping tokens between Bitcoin and the $HYPER Layer 2 boasts near-instantaneous finality. Staking doesn’t have to wait till the full Layer 2 launch, however. Purchase your $HYPER tokens for the current price of $0.012475 and earn 165% APY. The presale has already raised over $6.3M. Check out the Bitcoin Hyper presale page to learn more. Tron ($TRX) – dApps and Stablecoins on Top-10 Blockchain TRON ($TRX) is a decentralized proof‑of‑stake platform supporting smart contracts and DApps. Managed by the TRON Foundation (now a DAO), the network enables developers decentralized applications with an emphasis on high transaction throughput and low cost. TRON uses a Delegated Proof‑of‑Stake (DPoS) consensus model. $TRX is TRON’s native token, and ranks among the top 10 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Notably, Tron also supports over $80B $USDT on the Tron network; that’s more $USDT on Tron than on Ethereum, its native blockchain. It highlights Tron’s use case as a cross-border payments network. With stablecoin adoption growing – even Visa’s getting into the game – the future looks bright for a blockchain with native stablecoin support. Maxi Doge Token (MAXI) – Where Big Doges Play for Big Gains Maxi Doge ($MAXI) brings max energy to the meme coin world with a Dogecoin successor. Maxi Doge only plays for big gains; there’s no utility here other than a fund designed to provide up to 1000x leverage for key $MAXI plays. Maxi turns the marketing up to the highest setting with an aggressive, catchy vibe. This Doge eats, lifts, and trades memes – sleep optional. The presale has been a high‑voltage success, raising over $178K within the first three days. Tokens are currently priced at $0.00025, making this the best time to get in on the ground floor of the project. MAXI supports staking with daily smart‑contract rewards and a staking APY of 1,352%. There’s also a strong community vibe to the project, with more $MAXI tokens for traders who spot the best ROI opportunities for Maxi Doge plays. To get a better feel for the energy $MAXI brings, check out the Maxi Doge presale page . IMF Recognition Just the Beginning for Bitcoin, Crypto Adoption The IMF and UN’s formal recognition of Bitcoin and crypto assets as components of national wealth signals a clear shift in global financial policy.

2025-08-01T13:37:48,"Fed Holds Rates, Trump Strikes With New Tariffs as Bitcoin and Alts React: Your Weekly Crypto Recap","Another important, volatile, and eventful week passed by. It had traders and investors looking out for the latest Federal Reserve meeting, which took place a few days ago. But before it, bitcoin’s price had recovered from last week’s plunge below $115,000 on Friday and had returned to its familiar trading range between $117,000 and $119,000. The asset traded between those two lines for days ahead of the Wednesday FOMC meeting, with little to no volatility and success when it comes to breaching either side. Hours before the central bank announced its policy decision, the US GDP report for Q2 went out, which was better than expected, showing a significant economic increase of 3%. US President Trump immediately used this opportunity to urge Fed Chair Jerome Powell to cut the rates, but to no avail. To the surprise of almost no one, the US central bank left the rates unchanged for the fifth consecutive time. BTC’s price reaction was immediate as the asset slipped from nearly $119,000 to under $116,000. However, it managed to recover the losses by Thursday when it neared the upper boundary of this channel once again. Nevertheless, the bears were persistent, and, after getting some assistance from Trump’s latest set of tariffs against numerous countries, rejected bitcoin at that level. Within hours, the cryptocurrency’s price tumbled to a three-week low of $114,000, charted earlier today. Still, BTC managed to mark its highest monthly closure at roughly $115,000 yesterday evening, even though it’s 2.5% down on the week. The altcoins, though, have charted even more notable price declines compared to last Friday’s valuations. ETH and XRP have slumped by 5% each, while SOL, DOGE, ADA, HYPE, XLM, SUI, LINK, HBAR, and many others have seen losses of up to 10%.

Another major news that came out earlier this week was the long-anticipated Digital Asset report from the US White House. Interestingly, it mentioned different industry initiatives like stablecoins and DeFi, but failed to provide any details about the country’s strategic Bitcoin reserve. Ethereum Turns 10: What Will Define the Next Decade? It’s a week for anniversaries in the cryptocurrency space, with Shiba Inu and Ethereum standing out for their fifth and tenth birthdays, respectively. Here are some of Ethereum’s massive achievements since 2015 and what might lie ahead. Ethereum ETF Inflows Soar in July, Outpacing Last 11 Months Combined . Speaking of Ethereum, its underlying asset has been on fire for the past few months, driven to a large extent by the substantial inflows into the spot ETH ETFs. In fact, July saw more net inflows into those financial vehicles than the previous 11 months combined. Strategy Tops IPO Charts in 2025 With $2.52B Raise—More Bitcoin Bought . Although it didn’t announce a bitcoin purchase on Monday, as usual, the Saylor-spearheaded company held an IPO for 28 million shares for STRC and raised over $2.5 billion. Naturally, it used a large portion of this stash to accumulate 21,021 BTC. Bitcoin Whales Seize 68% of Supply After Adding 218,570 BTC . Reports emerged after BTC’s latest correction that retail investors had begun offloading sizeable portions of the asset. At the same time, though, whales have been on a buying spree and now hold 68% of the cryptocurrency’s supply. Altseason in Full Swing? These CryptoQuant Charts Point to Yes . Whether or not this cycle will go through an altseason continues to be a heated discussion within the community.

2025-08-01T13:27:08,"Bitcoin Mining Profitability Last Month Hit Highest Level Since the Halving: JPMorgan","Bitcoin (BTC) miners enjoyed another strong month in July, with profitability reaching the highest level since the last halving event, Wall Street bank JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report Friday. ""Bitcoin miners earned an average of $57,400 per EH/s in daily block reward revenue in July, up 4% from June, representing the highest level since the halving,"" analysts Reginald Smith and Charles Pearce wrote. Still, ""daily revenue and gross profit per EH/S are still 43% and 50% below pre-halving levels, respectively,"" the authors wrote. The Bitcoin halving is a quadrennial event where the reward for mining new blocks is halved. The most recent halving was in April 2024, reducing the reward from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC per block. The monthly average network hashrate , a proxy for competition in the industry and mining difficulty, rose 4% to 899 exahashes per second (EH/s) in July, after a decline in June in response to warmer temperatures, the analysts wrote. Mining difficulty was 9% higher at the end of last month, and 48% higher than before the last halving event, the report said. Ten of the thirteen U.S.-listed miners that the bank tracks outperformed bitcoin in July. In terms of stock performance, Argo Blockchain (ARBK) outperformed with a 66% gain, while Core Scientific (CORZ) underperformed the group with a 21% decline, the report added.

2025-08-01T13:25:10,"Bitcoin Price Skyrockets: Decoding the Astounding Ascent Above $116,000","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Skyrockets: Decoding the Astounding Ascent Above $116,000 The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with excitement as Bitcoin, the pioneering digital asset, has achieved a significant milestone, soaring past the $116,000 mark. This remarkable surge in Bitcoin price has captured the attention of investors, analysts, and enthusiasts alike, signaling a potentially new chapter in its dynamic journey. As the market continues to evolve, understanding the forces behind such movements becomes crucial for anyone navigating the digital asset landscape. Let us delve into what this latest price action signifies and what it could mean for the future of cryptocurrencies. What’s Driving the Astounding Bitcoin Price Surge? The recent rally in Bitcoin price is not an isolated event but rather the culmination of several interconnected factors influencing the broader crypto market. Understanding these drivers is key to comprehending Bitcoin’s current momentum and its potential trajectory. Here are some of the primary catalysts: Institutional Adoption: A growing number of traditional financial institutions are showing increased interest and participation in the Bitcoin market. This includes major investment firms, corporations, and even sovereign wealth funds allocating portions of their portfolios to digital assets. Such institutional inflows bring substantial capital and lend greater legitimacy to Bitcoin as a serious asset class. Supply Dynamics: Bitcoin’s design incorporates a finite supply, with only 21 million coins ever to be minted. Furthermore, ‘halving’ events, which reduce the rate at which new Bitcoins are created, periodically constrict supply. The most recent halving event, coupled with long-term holding by existing investors, contributes to a scarcity effect, which can push prices upward when demand increases. Macroeconomic Landscape: In an era of global economic uncertainty, high inflation, and unconventional monetary policies, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a hedge against traditional financial instability. Its decentralized nature and limited supply make it an attractive alternative asset for investors seeking protection against currency devaluation and economic volatility. Technological Advancements and Ecosystem Growth: Continuous development within the Bitcoin ecosystem, including improvements in scalability solutions, security protocols, and wider integration into payment systems, enhances its utility and appeal. A robust and expanding infrastructure supports greater adoption and confidence in the asset. These factors combine to create a compelling narrative for Bitcoin’s continued ascent, attracting both new and seasoned investors to the market. How Does Current Bitcoin Price Compare to Past Cycles? Bitcoin’s journey has been marked by periods of significant volatility, with dramatic peaks and troughs. Analyzing the current Bitcoin price surge in the context of its historical performance offers valuable insights into its cyclical nature and resilience. Unlike traditional assets, Bitcoin has shown a pattern of rapid growth followed by corrections, only to recover and set new highs. Consider the following comparison of market influences: Market Cycle Phase Key Influences on Bitcoin Price Typical Investor Sentiment Early Adoption (Pre-2017) Tech enthusiasts, early evangelists, niche interest Skepticism, curiosity Major Bull Runs (e.g., 2017, 2021) Retail FOMO, initial institutional interest, halving impact Euphoria, rapid speculation Correction/Bear Markets Regulatory concerns, profit-taking, macro headwinds Fear, capitulation Current Ascent (Above $116,000) Institutional adoption, ETF approvals, macro hedge, supply shock Renewed optimism, long-term conviction This historical perspective suggests that while volatility remains a characteristic, each cycle often sees Bitcoin reaching higher peaks, driven by expanding adoption and evolving market dynamics. The current surge above $116,000 appears to be driven by more fundamental shifts, particularly the mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset. What Are the Opportunities and Challenges Presented by the Current Bitcoin Price ? The impressive rise in Bitcoin price naturally opens up a range of opportunities for various stakeholders, but it also comes with inherent challenges that require careful consideration. Navigating this dynamic environment requires a balanced understanding of both aspects. Opportunities: Wealth Creation: For early investors, the surge in Bitcoin price translates into significant unrealized and realized gains, showcasing its potential as a high-growth asset. Increased Market Liquidity: Higher prices and increased trading volume often lead to greater market liquidity, making it easier for large transactions to occur without significant price impact. Innovation and Development: A strong Bitcoin price often fuels further investment into the ecosystem, encouraging developers to build new applications, services, and infrastructure around the network, thus expanding its utility. Mainstream Acceptance: As Bitcoin achieves new price milestones, it garners more attention from traditional finance and the general public, accelerating its journey towards mainstream acceptance and integration into daily economic activities. Challenges: Volatility Risk: Despite its growth, Bitcoin remains a highly volatile asset. Sharp price corrections can occur, leading to potential losses for investors who enter at peak valuations or are not prepared for market fluctuations. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Changes in regulations, or lack thereof in some regions, can introduce uncertainty and impact market sentiment. Security Concerns: While the Bitcoin network itself is robust, individual investors face risks related to secure storage of their assets, potential scams, and cyberattacks if proper precautions are not taken. Market Manipulation: The cryptocurrency market, while maturing, can still be susceptible to large-scale market manipulation, given its relatively smaller size compared to traditional financial markets. Investors must weigh these opportunities against the challenges, conducting thorough research and understanding their risk tolerance before making any investment decisions. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Current Bitcoin Price Environment For those looking to engage with the cryptocurrency market amidst this exciting period for Bitcoin price , a strategic approach is essential. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Conduct Thorough Research: Before investing, dedicate time to understand Bitcoin’s technology, its underlying principles, and the market dynamics. Knowledge is your strongest tool. Diversify Your Portfolio: While Bitcoin is a leading asset, consider diversifying your crypto holdings across different reputable cryptocurrencies and traditional assets to mitigate risk. Understand Risk Tolerance: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Bitcoin’s volatility means that significant price swings are possible, and capital is at risk. Secure Your Assets: Use reputable exchanges and consider hardware wallets for long-term storage of your Bitcoin to protect against theft and hacking. Stay Informed: The crypto market moves rapidly. Keep abreast of market news, technological developments, and regulatory changes to make informed decisions. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of a single large investment, consider investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of the price. This strategy can help mitigate the impact of volatility over time. Adopting these practices can help individuals navigate the complexities of the crypto market more effectively and responsibly. The surge in Bitcoin price above $116,000 is a testament to its enduring appeal and growing importance in the global financial landscape. While the journey of digital assets remains dynamic and subject to fluctuations, Bitcoin’s ability to consistently recover and achieve new milestones underscores its foundational strength and increasing acceptance. For investors and enthusiasts, this period presents both significant opportunities and the necessity for diligent research and cautious participation. As Bitcoin continues to carve its path, its role as a transformative technology and a compelling investment asset only solidifies. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does the rise in Bitcoin price above $116,000 signify? The rise signifies strong market confidence, increased institutional adoption, and a growing perception of Bitcoin as a valuable digital asset and a potential hedge against traditional economic instability. It marks a significant milestone in its price discovery journey. Is it too late to invest in Bitcoin now that its price is so high? The decision to invest depends on individual financial goals and risk tolerance. While the price is high, many analysts believe Bitcoin has long-term growth potential due to its finite supply and increasing utility. However, it is crucial to conduct thorough research and consider the inherent volatility. What factors could cause the Bitcoin price to drop? Potential factors include increased regulatory scrutiny, significant market corrections from profit-taking, negative macroeconomic news, security breaches on exchanges, or a decline in institutional interest. Bitcoin’s price is highly sensitive to market sentiment and global events. How does institutional adoption affect Bitcoin price? Institutional adoption significantly boosts Bitcoin price by introducing large capital inflows, enhancing its legitimacy as an asset class, and increasing demand. When major financial players and corporations invest, it signals a broader acceptance and reduces perceived risk. What is the role of Bitcoin halving events in its price movement? Bitcoin halving events reduce the rate at which new Bitcoins are created, effectively cutting the supply of new coins entering the market. Historically, these events have been followed by significant price increases due to the principle of reduced supply meeting sustained or increased demand. Where can I monitor the live Bitcoin price? You can monitor the live Bitcoin price on various cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, or through financial news websites and dedicated crypto market tracking platforms that provide real-time data.

Here are the details","Tokyo-based publicly traded Bitcoin treasury firm Metaplanet announced that it has applied to issue 555 billion Japanese yen (approximately $3.7 billion) worth of stock to fund its strategy of accumulating Bitcoin until 2027. Metaplanet Plans to Issue $3.7 Billion in Bitcoin Purchases by 2027 This shelf registration, valid from August 9, 2025, to August 8, 2027, will allow Metaplanet to issue these securities in increments, depending on market conditions. The company stated that this move aims to strengthen its previously announced goal of accumulating 210,000 BTC by 2027. This new capital increase plan represents approximately 75% of the company's current market capitalization of 729.45 billion yen and has the potential to significantly change Metaplanet's future direction. However, the company emphasized that it currently has no plans for a private share issue, announcing that the plan has not yet been finalized. Furthermore, for the issuance to proceed, a proposal to increase the number of authorized shares from the current 1.61 billion to 2.723 billion must be approved at the Extraordinary General Assembly (EGM) on September 1st. If approved, the company will be able to issue two new types of perpetual preferred stock: “Class A” and “Class B.” These shares, each expected to be worth 277.5 billion yen, will receive dividends of up to 6%, prioritizing ordinary shareholders, and the proceeds will be used directly to purchase bitcoin. Currently, Metaplanet holds a total of 17,132 BTC, including its most recent purchase of 780 BTC on July 28. Based on Bitcoin's current market price of $114,396, the company's total assets are worth approximately $1.95 billion. *This is not investment advice.

2025-08-01T13:16:01,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Troubles Just Getting Started After 3% Daily Decline?","Bitcoin is showing clear signs of weakness, with increasing selling pressure driving the price lower. The asset has now approached a decisive multi-month support zone, with a confirmed breakdown triggering a sharp decline toward the $111K threshold. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart After an extended period of sideways movement within the $116K to $123K range, Bitcoin has now turned downward, breaching the lower threshold. This drop signals a rise in distribution and selling interest, with the asset now testing a major support near $114K, coinciding with the lower boundary of its long-standing price channel. This region marks a critical battleground between buyers and sellers. A break below this level would likely trigger a new wave of sell orders, setting the stage for a deeper correction toward the $111K zone. The reaction at this pivotal level is expected to play a key role in shaping Bitcoin’s mid-term trajectory. The 4-Hour Chart Zooming in, the price was recently rejected from the upper boundary of a rising flag near $118K, signaling strong selling pressure. The recent drop has taken Bitcoin back toward the lower end of the flag structure, around $114K, which also aligns with the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level. This confluence creates a strong area of support. A confirmed break below this level could lead to a long-squeeze scenario, pushing the price even lower. However, if demand picks up and buyers regain control, a bounce toward the $118K zone remains possible in the short term. On-chain Analysis By ShayanMarkets The Binance BTC/USDT liquidation heatmap highlights a tense standoff within the current market structure, with Bitcoin’s price caught between two significant liquidity pockets, one concentrated above the $120K level and another below $114K. These zones mark areas of high leveraged exposure, making them key magnets for institutional players and liquidity-driven moves. As the price hovers near the $114K threshold, the probability of a downward breakout increases. A drop below this level could trigger a chain reaction of stop-outs and liquidations, driving sharp downside momentum. Traders should monitor these zones closely, as any decisive move could unleash rapid and volatile price swings.

2025-08-01T13:10:01,"Coinbase: Q2 Disappointment Highlights Crypto Retail-To-Institution Transition","Summary Coinbase's Q2 report disappointed investors with weaker sales in key segments and lower trading volumes despite a rise in Bitcoin. Coinbase's future is increasingly tied to institutional flows within a more regulated market, offsetting retail weakness but raising questions about long-term crypto fundamentals. COIN's valuation remains stretched around that of traditional exchanges, with high growth expectations offset by greater risks given the youth and volatility of the crypto market. Short term, I see no strong bearish case, but I remain skeptical of crypto's long-term viability and would not buy COIN at current levels, expecting an eventual reversal. COIN's Q3 outlook improves with Ethereum's surge, but I expect retail investors will shift toward lower-cost crypto ETFs over the next year. Coinbase ( COIN ) announced Q2 earnings Thursday evening, disappointing investors with an adjusted EPS of $0.12, significantly below the $1.49 analyst consensus. Its net revenue came in at $1.42B, about 11% lower than expected. Losses were seen in most segments, with lower subscription and services sales, transaction revenue, and trading volumes. Its operating expenses also rose sharply to $1.52B, up ~37% from Q2 2024. The report sent shares around 12% lower overnight, implying a significant miss. CEO Brian Armstrong focused on the continued expansion of new crypto assets and the integration of decentralized exchanges onto its app, with 24/7 trading of derivatives contracts on BTC and ETH. Its Q3 guidance remained strong, expecting expansion of its subscription and services segment, benefiting from the rebound in crypto prices, particularly the recent surge in Ethereum ( ETH-USD ). Coinbase is one of my best and worst-performing analyses. I saw it as a bullish discount opportunity in early 2023 when it was worth around a tenth of its current price. However, I last covered it with a bearish outlook in the May 2024 article, "" Coinbase: Cryptocurrencies Moving From 'New Paradigm' To Denial (Rating Downgrade) ."" Since then, it has risen by a staggering 68%, violating my bearish thesis. So what went wrong? Most obviously, Bitcoin rose from around $60K to roughly $112K today, rising roughly as much as COIN. Although my bearish outlook has been, thus far, proven wrong, I stated: Because enthusiasm remains strong, I would not be surprised to see Bitcoin hit $100K or more in 2024. I will not make that bet, but I would avoid betting against it or COIN as the apparent ""cryptocurrency collective consciousness"" seems quite eager to see a breakout. I understood the futility of betting against the herd of cryptocurrency bulls. Enthusiasm became parabolic after Trump's election, viewing him as creating pro-crypto policies, pushing Bitcoin to $100K by year's end as anticipated. My view on Coinbase was long-term and not actionable on the short side for that reason. That said, I incorrectly thought that Bitcoin momentum was slow; it did continue to fall briefly after May but surged, most notably after the election. My bearish thesis rested on my view that Bitcoin is fundamentally not a viable currency or a wealth-store hedge against inflation. I also believed that COIN's valuation required unrealistic income growth and that a true fiat currency devaluation (that many believe would benefit Bitcoin) would operationally harm Coinbase and drive competition into lower-cost platforms. On the back of its disappointing Q2 earnings report, I believe it is an ideal time to reconsider my previous views and take an updated outlook on the company and the cryptocurrency backdrop. Retail Slowing as Institutions See Legitimacy Bitcoin and other major cryptos drive COIN's immediate performance. The stock's price is highly correlated to Bitcoin as well as its revenue. See below: Data by YCharts (This data precedes the aftermath of the Q2 report.) Any outlook on Coinbase requires analysis of both the company and the cryptocurrency market. Higher crypto prices usually coincide with more trading activity, inflows from new accounts, higher transaction commissions, and more investor interest in the crypto landscape. The fact that Coinbase's segment revenues fell in Q2 despite a rebound in Bitcoin is notable. Of course, the non-Bitcoin cryptos did not perform as well until Q3 began. In the past, I've noted that Bitcoin's performance is usually inversely correlated to individual investor cash allocation levels. This index is measured by the American Association of Individual Investors as representing the higher-wealth segment of retail investors, not necessarily representing those buying Bitcoin; however, it is a decent proxy. Over the past decade, Bitcoin's peaks and troughs usually align with the opposite in cash allocation levels: Data by YCharts My bearish take on Bitcoin last year was based on relatively low cash allocation levels . In my view, Bitcoin and most cryptos act as sinks for excess liquidity. People with spare cash and sufficient equity exposure (or uninterested in equities) park some money into cryptocurrencies. When people have more cash, they have greater crypto buying power. Of course, despite lower cash allocations in 2024, Bitcoin has had tremendous performance. We were starting to see negative pressure around last fall, as I expected, but that quickly reversed after the November election. I did not appreciate how much Trump's cryptocurrency alignment mattered to Bitcoin investors. In general, I've viewed the Trump-crypto trade as a ""buy the rumor, sell the news"" trend. Trump has pursued a handful of orders and legislation that have arguably benefited the crypto market. In January, he issued an order to promote dollar-backed stablecoins while prohibiting agencies from creating CBDCs. He later created the much-speculated Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, promising not to sell confiscated Bitcoin. This month, we've seen the GENIUS Act , creating a law for stablecoins and providing clearer market structure rules for exchanges like Coinbase. Trump has also appointed a number of pro-crypto leaders to agencies, such as the SEC. On Wednesday, Trump issued a 160-page document that outlines regulatory needs, supporting Trump's goal to make the US the ""crypto capital of the world."" On one hand, I've argued that these policies do not directly benefit Bitcoin by pushing significant liquidity into the market, as many had hoped. I've also seen increased regulation as delegitimizing Bitcoin's status as a ""decentralized alternative currency"" free from government regulation and oversight, which was its original purpose. However, by enacting regulatory frameworks, Trump has legitimized Bitcoin for larger institutional investors like banks. With that, we've also seen tremendous growth in the cryptocurrency ETF market. Liquidity fundamentals remain potentially supportive. AAII cash allocation levels are declining, implying cash is flowing into risk assets ( bond allocations are also falling). The US dollar is weakening due to a higher rate cut probability and a potential Fed chair replacement. The US monetary base, or the total amount of currency (physical and Fed-created), is also rising as the Fed quietly winds down its tightening schedule . To a degree, a weaker dollar and higher monetary base are historically bullish for BTC: Data by YCharts Monetary conditions are potentially bullish for Bitcoin. Liquidity was somewhat tight last year, yet Bitcoin still rose. In my view, it benefited dramatically from higher inflows through ETFs and improved institutional support through regulation. We can visualize this by looking at the units outstanding for, by far, the largest Bitcoin ETF ( IBIT ). IBIT's flows were very strong post-election, slowing during the spring correction, with a sharp uptrend during the recovery. See below: Data by YCharts IBIT's flows today are slowing compared to the May to mid-July trend. That could be a bearish signal, but it is quite early and may reverse. Bitcoin has also been pinned under $120K since mid-July, potentially as recent crypto legislation proves to be a ""buy the rumor, sell the news"" trade. Although liquidity conditions are comparatively positive and may be fueling a ""melt-up"" in most risk assets, they are offset by weak economic conditions for median households. As detailed in a few recent articles , since late 2022, consumer trends have been weakening for the median American consumer. Savings levels are chronically low, confidence is weak, and hiring is abysmal . Home prices are also potentially falling . That said, although median data is weak, mean data is decent; average wage growth is good, but the median is not . The United States is the largest market for Bitcoin , but it is a global asset. To that end, a weaker US dollar should benefit it, though that may depend on whether or not the falling dollar coincides with a recession. In my view, if we assume economic strength is fading in the US, that is likely to be seen in most other high-income countries. Some may argue that an economic slowdown will not harm Bitcoin. That may be true in the long run, particularly if a recession fuels excessive rate cuts and quantitative easing. However, in most cases, Bitcoin and COIN decline with risky assets such as equities. I do not have an outlook on Bitcoin and think it should remain ""sticky"" around the $100K level. Some monetary/liquidity factors may push it higher; however, lower inflows into IBIT, Trump's volatile political stock , and seemingly underappreciated economic risks (weaker household savings fundamentals) give me a somewhat bearish long-term outlook. Coinbase's Regulatory Moat Expands Compared to last year, I argue that Coinbase faces greater competitive pressure from cryptocurrency ETFs. Spot BTC funds typically have near-zero trading costs and expense ratios well under 50 bps. For long-term buy-and-hold investors, I think IBIT makes more sense than Coinbase's fees, which can be over 2% round-trip. IBIT is huge, with an AUM of over $86B. Coinbase may be around $330B, but the growth rate is stronger for the crypto ETFs. Now, IBIT and others are not direct competitors because they often pay Coinbase to be custodians. Its latest investor call noted it powers over 80% of the custody for crypto ETF issuers, as well as a partner to over 150 government agencies looking to manage crypto assets. Coinbase receives a ~ 0.2% fee for this , something, but far less than it receives from retail transactions. Coinbase has shifted its focus toward ""Crypto-as-a-service,"" seeing some success in Coinbase One, the USDC stablecoin, the layer 2 network , which aims to make Bitcoin more scalable (potentially solving the transaction and energy issue), and a derivatives market. The expansion of these products has led to more people seeing Coinbase as the central backbone of the cryptocurrency market. With the GENIUS Act and other orders/legislation providing a more robust regulatory framework, I see that Coinbase is ideally positioned for this. Its market capitalization gives it vast acquisition buying power, allowing it to acquire firms like Deribit easily. Banks that once scoffed at cryptocurrencies and mocked Coinbase are now becoming close partners. On Wednesday, Coinbase and JPMorgan ( JPM ) announced a deal to make crypto purchases easier for JP Morgan customers, using Chase credit cards on that platform, or transferring Chase reward points. We saw a similar deal with PNC Bank ( PNC ) earlier in July. Crypto ETF proliferation may cut into Coinbase's revenue from retail trading, but altogether, we see a transition from a retail focus toward an institutional one. Ultimately, there is far more liquidity potential from institutions than from retail investors. This gives Coinbase strong growth avenues and a tremendous moat over its competitors. Despite that, I find the centralized institutional support and regulatory framework that benefits Coinbase problematic. I first heard of Bitcoin around 2015, seeing its popularity surge as a decentralized alternative technology that would end government control of currency. I argue that although Trump's efforts benefit many cryptos and Coinbase, they go directly against the original mission of Bitcoin. Borrowing from the White House press release: The GENIUS Act prioritizes consumer protection, strengthens the U.S. dollar’s reserve currency status, and bolsters our national security. Fundamentally, these policies are aimed at strengthening the fiat currency's position within a cryptocurrency market. Years ago, there was a clear divide between government/institutions viewing cryptocurrency as a potential threat and people buying Bitcoin as a rebellious hedge against fiat money volatility. In my opinion, there is a legitimate risk that the fundamental bull case behind cryptocurrencies is broken by excessive regulatory oversight. Retail investors may sell as a result, and it is unclear if institutional support is strong enough to provide ""exit liquidity"". In the short term, new regulations are supportive of Bitcoin and secure Coinbase's competitive moat, but I continue to doubt its long-term viability. The Bottom Line My outlook for Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies is neutral. Specifically, I see a bearish bias among data relevant to retail crypto flows, relevant to Coinbase in the short term, offset by supportive trends for institutional flows. The latter includes improved regulation, a shift back toward pro-inflation/liquidity monetary policies, and altogether improved legitimacy for banks and investment funds. It is unclear if that tailwind offsets the seemingly weaker investment savings capacity for median-income people and potentially low sideline cash that could go into cryptocurrencies. Retail investor cash allocations are lower, but are still falling—implying retail inflows are still available, but not for long. The recent stagnation in major crypto ETF inflows also supports that. My view on Coinbase is similar. I expect the company may see more pressure on its retail trading fee segment with lower account growth, but its deals with institutions may provide superior verticals/niches. Still, its valuation is extremely high. The company is worth about as much as CME Group ( CME ) and Intercontinental Exchange ( ICE ). Its forward ""P/E"" is much higher at 67X, with CME at about 25X and ICE ~27X; however, its forward price-to-sales is between the two: Data by YCharts Although Coinbase's valuation is extremely high, it is generally reasonable compared to that of CME and ICE. I argue that COIN is overvalued because its risks are greater, given that CME and ICE operate markets that have existed since the 17th century, while COIN is around fifteen years old. The counterargument is that Coinbase's revenue has more growth potential because of its youth, and Coinbase has a stronger competitive moat. I remain skeptical that the cryptocurrency market is little more than a glorified gambling industry benefiting from excessive liquidity generation through quantitative easing. I think it is far from its roots as a decentralized currency alternative. In my experience, most people who buy it seem to do so to speculate on a higher price, not out of a genuine desire to hedge against fiat currency risks. I would not buy COIN today, and suspect it will eventually decline further. However, in the short run, we have a small discount after its Q2 disappointment. My bearish view is long-term, expecting a fall within years, but not necessarily months. Its short-term performance is driven by BTC, which I feel is futile to predict. At this point, Q3 is likely to show improvement, given that Bitcoin is up while Ethereum is nearly 50% higher. I suspect its Q2 weakness may be due to lower retail buying power and a shift in flows toward ETFs. This is likely its greatest risk in Q3, offset by its significant expansion efforts and widening range of services and institutional partnerships.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4807534-coinbase-q2-disappointment-highlights-crypto-retail-to-institution-transition?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|EXCHANGE|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET","COIN",cryptocompare
2025-08-01T13:00:27,"XRP‑Dedicated Analyst Accused of Being Paid By Ripple, Then Makes This Demand","A sarcastic jab by prominent XRP analyst Egrag Crypto has gone viral on X after he was accused of being a paid promoter for Ripple. In a humorous response, Egrag wrote: “Can someone tell Ripple to pay me please,” after a user named Johan (@johnnypretor) claimed all XRP influencers were scammers likely being paid by Ripple to promote what he called a “scam coin.” Egrag’s mock demand wasn’t a serious request; it was sarcasm aimed at the growing trend of Bitcoin maximalists discrediting XRP supporters by accusing them of shilling for Ripple. He followed up with a playful poll: “Should I block him? Vote yes or no in the comments.” The post quickly gained attention and became a flashpoint in the never-ending ideological battle between the XRP Army and Bitcoin purists. The Accusation That Sparked It Johan’s comment came as a direct reply to one of Egrag’s XRP analyses, claiming: “All these influencers are a bunch of scammers. Probably getting paid by Ripple to keep promoting their scam coin.” The accusation isn’t new; critics have long alleged Ripple is secretly funding a network of social media influencers to create artificial hype around XRP. But these claims remain unproven. Can some one tell @Ripple to pay me please because @johnnypretor decided I am being paid by #Ripple . You tell me if I should block him or no. Vote by yes or no in the comments. pic.twitter.com/Cgxi45jYG5 — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) August 1, 2025 Egrag, like many in the XRP community, insists his support is rooted in research, utility, and belief in the XRPL ecosystem , not in compensation. His sarcastic tone pokes fun at the baselessness of the accusation. Ripple and the Paid Influencer Narrative Ripple has consistently denied claims of paying influencers to promote XRP. CEO Brad Garlinghouse addressed the topic directly earlier this year, clarifying that while Ripple engages in public relations and education, it does not fund social media personalities to boost XRP’s reputation. Likewise, legal analysts such as Bill Morgan and Mr. Huber have dismissed these conspiracy theories as a distraction from real discussions about crypto regulation and innovation. They’ve pointed out that XRP’s community is one of the most organically engaged in the space, driven not by payouts but by conviction in its long-term value. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ideological Warfare: Maxis vs. Utility-Driven Projects This skirmish is just one chapter in a larger ideological war. Bitcoin maximalists often believe Bitcoin is the only legitimate cryptocurrency, viewing all altcoins, especially those associated with corporations, as scams or threats to decentralization. XRP, developed by Ripple and focused on institutional payments, is frequently their top target. In contrast, XRP supporters highlight the coin’s fast transaction speeds, low costs, and global adoption as proof of its real-world use. For them, XRP is not just a speculative asset, but a tool with utility. Egrag’s tongue-in-cheek demand for Ripple to “pay him” was a satirical way of pushing back against yet another unfounded accusation. While the crypto space thrives on debate, this episode reveals how quickly criticism can spiral into personal attacks. Whether Egrag ends up blocking Johan or not, the broader conversation remains: in a tribal industry like crypto, even the loudest voices of conviction are often mistaken for shills.

2025-08-01T13:00:12,"US Jobs Report Shocks Markets: Unpacking the Surprising Decline","BitcoinWorld US Jobs Report Shocks Markets: Unpacking the Surprising Decline The economic landscape often feels like a complex puzzle, with various pieces constantly shifting. For those navigating the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, understanding these shifts is not just an academic exercise; it is crucial for informed decision-making. Recently, the latest US Jobs Report delivered a significant piece of that puzzle, revealing a surprising slowdown in job creation that has sent ripples across traditional and digital asset markets alike. This unexpected turn in the US Jobs Report highlights the interconnectedness of global economies and the crypto sphere. What is the US Jobs Report and Why Does it Matter for Crypto? The US Jobs Report , officially known as the Employment Situation Summary, is one of the most closely watched economic indicators released monthly by the U.S. Department of Labor. It provides a comprehensive snapshot of the nation’s employment health, including nonfarm payrolls, unemployment rates, and average hourly earnings. Why should crypto investors pay attention to the US Jobs Report ? Monetary Policy Clues: The Federal Reserve closely monitors employment data when making decisions about interest rates. A strong job market might signal inflationary pressures, potentially leading to rate hikes. A weaker market could suggest the Fed might ease its stance or even consider rate cuts. These decisions directly influence liquidity and investor appetite for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Investor Sentiment: A robust job market generally indicates a healthy economy, fostering investor confidence. Conversely, a weakening job market can trigger recession fears, prompting investors to pull back from riskier assets and seek safer havens. Consumer Spending: Employment directly impacts consumer spending power. When people are employed and earning, they spend more, driving economic growth. A slowdown can dampen spending, affecting corporate earnings and overall market sentiment. The July 2024 US Jobs Report: A Closer Look at the Data The recent US Jobs Report for July presented a notable deviation from expectations. The U.S. economy added 73,000 seasonally adjusted nonfarm jobs, according to Investing.com. This figure fell significantly short of the market forecast, which had anticipated an increase of 110,000 jobs. This underperformance in the US Jobs Report suggests a potential cooling in the labor market, which could have multifaceted implications. Metric July 2024 Actual Market Forecast Nonfarm Jobs Added 73,000 110,000 The July 2024 US Jobs Report showed a significant miss compared to market expectations, adding only 73,000 jobs against a forecast of 110,000. US Jobs Report Shocks Markets: Unpacking the Surprising Decline How Does the US Jobs Report Influence Crypto Markets? The impact of the US Jobs Report on cryptocurrency markets is indirect but profound. Here are key ways this economic data can ripple through the digital asset space: Interest Rate Expectations: A weaker US Jobs Report might be interpreted as a sign that the economy is slowing down, potentially reducing inflationary pressures. This could lead the Federal Reserve to adopt a more dovish stance, meaning they might pause or even consider cutting interest rates sooner than expected. Lower interest rates generally make riskier assets like Bitcoin and altcoins more attractive, as the cost of borrowing decreases and traditional investments yield less. Risk-On/Risk-Off Sentiment: When economic data, such as a disappointing US Jobs Report , suggests a slowdown or potential recession, investors often shift towards a ‘risk-off’ mentality. This involves moving capital from volatile assets (like cryptocurrencies and growth stocks) into safer havens (like government bonds or the U.S. dollar). Conversely, if the market interprets the jobs data as ‘just right’ – not too hot to warrant aggressive rate hikes, but not too cold to signal a deep recession – it could foster a ‘risk-on’ environment, benefiting crypto. Dollar Strength: The U.S. dollar often strengthens during periods of economic uncertainty or when the Fed is perceived to be less aggressive with rate hikes compared to other central banks. A stronger dollar can put downward pressure on dollar-denominated assets, including cryptocurrencies, as they become more expensive for international buyers. Navigating the Shifting Tides: Crypto Investment Strategies Post-US Jobs Report Given the implications of the latest US Jobs Report , what can crypto investors consider? Understanding the nuances of economic data can help refine your approach: Monitor Fed Communications: Pay close attention to statements from Federal Reserve officials following the US Jobs Report . Their commentary will provide further insight into how they interpret the data and what it means for future monetary policy. The Fed’s stance on interest rates is a primary driver for market liquidity. Diversify Your Portfolio: While crypto can offer significant returns, its volatility remains a factor. In times of economic uncertainty signaled by reports like the US Jobs Report , having a diversified portfolio that includes less volatile assets can help mitigate risk. Long-Term Perspective: Short-term market reactions to economic data can be intense. However, for many crypto assets, their long-term value proposition is tied to technological innovation and adoption. Maintaining a long-term perspective can help weather short-term fluctuations caused by economic reports. Stay Informed: The economic narrative is constantly evolving. Regular updates on inflation, GDP, and subsequent employment reports will provide a clearer picture of the economic trajectory and its potential impact on crypto. Challenges and Opportunities for Digital Assets Amidst the US Jobs Report Data The current economic climate, influenced by reports like the US Jobs Report , presents both challenges and opportunities for the digital asset space. Challenges: Increased Volatility: Economic uncertainty often leads to heightened market volatility, making crypto investments more unpredictable in the short term. Regulatory Scrutiny: As traditional markets react to economic data, regulators might increase their focus on the crypto space, potentially introducing new rules that could impact adoption or innovation. Capital Flight: In a severe economic downturn, investors might withdraw capital from speculative assets, including crypto, to cover living expenses or reallocate to safer assets. Opportunities: Hedge Against Inflation (Long-term): If the Fed’s response to a weakening jobs market leads to more quantitative easing, some argue that Bitcoin, with its fixed supply, could act as a hedge against inflation over the long term. Innovation Flourishes: Bear markets or periods of economic uncertainty can often be fertile ground for genuine innovation, as projects focus on building robust technology rather than speculative trading. Accessibility: Crypto markets operate 24/7, offering continuous trading opportunities irrespective of traditional market hours, which can be an advantage during periods of rapid economic shifts. The Road Ahead: What to Expect from the US Economy and Crypto After the US Jobs Report? The latest US Jobs Report paints a picture of a cooling labor market, which could influence the Federal Reserve’s next moves. If this trend continues, it might reduce the likelihood of aggressive interest rate hikes, or even open the door for cuts in the future. Such a scenario could be broadly positive for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, as it implies looser monetary conditions and increased liquidity in the financial system. However, a significant slowdown could also signal broader economic weakness, potentially leading to recession fears that would dampen overall market sentiment. The crypto market will likely remain sensitive to subsequent economic data releases and the Fed’s evolving policy statements. The surprising numbers from the recent US Jobs Report serve as a potent reminder of the intricate dance between macroeconomic indicators and the world of digital assets. While the immediate reaction might be one of caution, understanding the underlying drivers allows investors to navigate these shifts with greater clarity. The path forward for both the traditional economy and the crypto market will be shaped by how policymakers respond to these evolving conditions, making vigilance and informed analysis more important than ever. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the significance of the US Jobs Report for the economy? The US Jobs Report is a key economic indicator providing insights into the health of the labor market, including job creation, unemployment rates, and wage growth. It is crucial for assessing economic growth, inflation pressures, and guiding monetary policy decisions by the Federal Reserve. 2. How does a weaker US Jobs Report typically affect interest rates? A weaker US Jobs Report often suggests a cooling economy, which can reduce inflationary pressures. This might lead the Federal Reserve to adopt a more dovish stance, potentially pausing interest rate hikes or even considering rate cuts to stimulate economic activity. 3. Why should cryptocurrency investors care about the US Jobs Report? Cryptocurrency markets are indirectly influenced by the US Jobs Report because it impacts macroeconomic factors like interest rates, inflation expectations, and overall investor sentiment. These factors dictate the availability of liquidity and the appetite for riskier assets like crypto. 4. Can a disappointing US Jobs Report be good for crypto? Potentially. If a disappointing US Jobs Report leads to expectations of lower interest rates or increased quantitative easing from the Fed, it could make riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies, more attractive due to a lower cost of capital and increased liquidity in the financial system. 5. What other economic indicators should crypto investors monitor alongside the US Jobs Report? Beyond the US Jobs Report , crypto investors should also monitor inflation reports (CPI, PCE), GDP growth, retail sales data, and Federal Reserve meeting minutes, as these indicators collectively provide a comprehensive view of the economic environment.
