2025-08-01T11:45:31,"200% Surge or 25% Pullback for Bitcoin as Grok Spots Familiar Setup","Bitcoin (BTC) is coiled tighter than a spring, according to AI analysis of a critical technical indicator. Grok’s review of historical Bollinger Band squeezes suggests the current extreme compression could precede a parabolic surge, potentially echoing past gains exceeding 4,600%. The Squeeze Before the Storm The buzz started when author and podcast host Scott Melker asked technical analyst and inventor of the Bollinger Bands, John Bollinger, how often Bitcoin’s daily BBs have been as tight as they currently are. However, another user prompted Grok, X’s in-house AI tool, for an answer to the same question. Responding on August 1, the AI revealed the bands have narrowed to a bandwidth of approximately 0.018, the tightest reading since February 2025. It also identified five similar instances of extreme tightness, below 0.03 bandwidth, since 2011. These were January 2013, September 2016, January 2023, August 2023, and February 2025. The historical aftermath is striking, with the squeezes often coming before substantial bullish breakouts. “Historical data shows Bollinger squeezes below 0.03 bandwidth often precede 100%+ rallies, like post-2016’s 4600% surge,” claimed Grok. “With current tightness at ~0.018, volatility looms—likely upward given Bitcoin’s trend.” According to the AI tool, some of the most dramatic examples included the period following September 2016, where the price of Bitcoin pumped by quadruple digits, moving to nearly $20,000 within 15 months. Post-January 2013 saw an even more eye-watering 8,560% climb. More recently, the August 2023 squeeze led to a 152% gain over seven months. While Grok projected a 50% to 200% upside over the next 3 to 12 months, with BTC potentially ending August anywhere between $130,000 and $145,000, it cautioned that direction isn’t guaranteed. The last time the Bollinger Bands were this tight, in February 2025, BTC was hit by a 25% pullback that saw its price drop from around $102,000 to below $84,000 by the end of that month. Macro Winds and Market Mechanics This technical tension is unfolding against a backdrop of significant macroeconomic sensitivity and persistent consolidation. As CryptoPotato reported earlier, BTC’s price went up as high as $119,000 following the U.S. Federal Reserve’s decision to keep interest rates unchanged for a fifth straight meeting. However, it dropped to a multi-week low of under $114,500 soon after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a raft of tariff adjustments on goods imported from multiple countries, including an additional 10% on Canadian products. The OG cryptocurrency has since improved marginally, having climbed back to just under $115,000 at the time of this writing. This, however, still reflects a 3% drop in the last 24 hours and a 4.1% dip over the past two weeks, even though it remains up 78% year-on-year.

2025-08-01T11:45:02,"New Bitcoin Staking Protocol Witnesses Surge in GitHub Activity As Chainlink Continues To Top DeFi Sector in Development: Santiment","A new Bitcoin ( BTC ) staking protocol has witnessed a surge in recent development activity, becoming one of the most active decentralized finance (DeFi) projects on GitHub, according to the crypto analytics firm Santiment. Babylon ( BABY ), which launched in April, aims to fix latency, security and programmability issues associated with BTC, something layer-2 projects have struggled with in the past. Santiment notes that the staking protocol clocked 155.73 notable GitHub events in the past 30 days, the third-most of any DeFi project. Second on the list is DeepBook Protocol ( DEEP ), which clocked 236 events. The DeepBook project is a decentralized central limit order book (CLOB), which is what exchanges use to facilitate buying and selling between traders by recording bids and offers. And topping the rankings in the decentralized oracle network Chainlink ( LINK ), with 274.67 events. Chainlink and DeepBook also occupied the top two spots on the list last month and in May . The analytics firm notes that it doesn’t count routine updates and relies on a “better methodology” to collect data for GitHub events based on a backtested process. Santiment has previously explained that crypto projects with lots of development could soon be shipping new features and are less likely to be exit scams.

2025-08-01T11:40:25,"Binance retains its lead as crypto exchange volume grows to $1.7T in July","Crypto exchange volume saw a major recovery in July, as traffic returned to levels not seen since February. Overall, centralized markets saw $1.7T in volumes for the past month, marked by active BTC and ETH trading and the beginnings of an altcoin market. Centralized crypto exchanges carried a total of $1.77T in volumes for July, recovering to levels not seen since February. Market activity peaked around July 24, close to the days of some of the biggest rallies for BTC and ETH. As with previous months, overall CEX activity mostly depended on sentiment, benefitting from the bullish performance of most assets. The market also responded to a potential altcoin recovery , boosting volumes for XRP and other previously forgotten assets. During peak trading times, both DEX and CEX were firing on all cylinders. Since the end of July, the share of DEXs fell to 23.5% as assets moved down from their peak. Centralized exchanges got a boost following an active month for stablecoins. The dollar-denominated tokens were mostly used in centralized trading pairs, followed by their utility on DEX. Exchanges were a key venue for buying spot BTC. In July, market operators still registered peak outflows, with reserves going to multi-year levels. Spot exchanges held only 934K BTC, while derivative markets held 1.43M. Binance saw an inflow of BTC in July, while most exchanges saw their reserves dwindling further to all-time lows. | Source: Cryptoquant Demand for coins came from a mix of ETF buying and additional treasury expansion, in addition to whale accumulation. On Binance , however, deposits increased the reserves from 538K BTC to over 562K . Binance leads the pack with over $700B in July Binance remained the leader in centralized exchange activity, with $706B in total monthly activity. In the year to date, Binance saw its highest activity in January, as the market was still driven by the momentum of December’s price records. The exchange reached a peak of over $146B in trading volumes on July 18. The exchange also got a boost from the series of records of the BNB token. The asset peaked at $858.34, boosting volumes and trading demand. The exchange kept its position following a successful Q2, as previously reported by Cryptopolitan . Despite the inflow of volumes, driven by whales and derivative trading, the Binance.com site took a step back. The site fell by six positions in the finance category, ranked 30th worldwide, while losing 64 positions in its overall ranking. The exchange also gained over 14% of its traffic from India, followed by 7.7% from the USA. In the past month, US-based traffic diminished the most, as traders shifted to other platforms. Ethereum drove the crypto exchange volume expansion on Binance Despite this, Binance remains a staple of crypto activity, as it connects its centralized and decentralized trading. The exchange tapped the month’s stellar performance, but the markets still failed to reach peak exuberance levels. Binance’s derivative trading was among the major factors for the exchange’s performance. In July, open interest on the exchange rose from $28B to over $36B. For that period, the ETH perpetual futures had the biggest share, surpassing even BTC. The ETH/USDT market pair made up over 25% of all derivative trades , with around 19.5% for BTC. USDT was the key crypto token boosting derivative activity, with over 79% of total volumes.

2025-08-01T11:25:10,"Spot ETH ETFs Soar: Unprecedented $5.43 Billion Inflows Signal a Powerful Market Shift","BitcoinWorld Spot ETH ETFs Soar: Unprecedented $5.43 Billion Inflows Signal a Powerful Market Shift The world of digital assets is buzzing with incredible news: U.S. Spot ETH ETFs have just recorded their largest monthly net inflows ever, hitting an astonishing $5.43 billion in July. This monumental figure isn’t just a number; it represents a seismic shift in how traditional finance is embracing the burgeoning crypto market, particularly Ethereum. For anyone tracking the evolution of cryptocurrency investments, this development is nothing short of groundbreaking. This record-breaking performance signifies a dramatic increase of 369% over June’s $1.16 billion inflows, and it completely eclipses May’s previous high of $564 million. The total net assets across all Spot ETH ETFs have consequently soared to $21.52 billion, marking a remarkable 108% increase from $10.32 billion at the close of June. This surge, as reported by ETF tracker SoSoValue, also coincided with a significant rally in Ethereum’s price, which climbed by 60% to peak near $3,933 during the month, according to Cointelegraph. What’s Fueling the Monumental Surge in Spot ETH ETFs Inflows? The record inflows into Spot ETH ETFs are not happening in a vacuum. Several key factors are contributing to this remarkable momentum, reflecting a growing confidence and appetite among institutional and retail investors alike. Understanding these drivers is crucial for appreciating the broader implications for the crypto market. Increased Institutional Adoption: The approval and subsequent launch of Spot ETH ETFs have opened the floodgates for institutional capital that previously faced regulatory hurdles or lacked suitable investment vehicles. These ETFs provide a regulated, accessible, and familiar pathway for large financial entities to gain exposure to Ethereum without directly holding the asset. Market Maturity and Regulatory Clarity: The success of Bitcoin ETFs paved the way, building investor trust and demonstrating the viability of crypto-backed investment products. The regulatory landscape, while still evolving, is providing clearer guidelines, which reduces uncertainty for large-scale investors. This growing clarity makes Spot ETH ETFs a more attractive proposition. Ethereum’s Ecosystem Growth: Beyond its price performance, Ethereum continues to be a cornerstone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) ecosystems. Its foundational role in Web3 development and its ongoing technological upgrades, such as the upcoming Dencun upgrade, enhance its appeal as a long-term investment. Investors are recognizing Ethereum’s utility and potential for innovation. Diversification Benefits: For many investors, Spot ETH ETFs offer a crucial diversification tool within their digital asset portfolios. While Bitcoin often serves as the primary entry point, Ethereum provides exposure to a different facet of the crypto market, one focused on smart contracts and decentralized applications. To put the July figures into perspective, let’s look at the monthly net inflows: Month Spot ETH ETFs Net Inflows May $564 million June $1.16 billion July $5.43 billion This table clearly illustrates the exponential growth, highlighting July as a pivotal month for Spot ETH ETFs . How Do Spot ETH ETFs Benefit Investors and the Broader Market? The introduction and rapid success of Spot ETH ETFs bring a host of benefits, not just for individual investors but for the entire digital asset ecosystem. These benefits underscore why these investment vehicles are becoming increasingly popular. For Investors: Accessibility: ETFs trade on traditional stock exchanges, making them easily accessible through standard brokerage accounts. This eliminates the complexities of setting up crypto wallets, managing private keys, or dealing with less regulated crypto exchanges. Liquidity: As exchange-traded funds, Spot ETH ETFs offer high liquidity, allowing investors to buy and sell shares throughout the trading day at market prices, much like traditional stocks. Security and Custody: ETF providers handle the secure storage of the underlying Ethereum, often with institutional-grade custodians. This removes the burden and risk of self-custody for investors, a significant concern for many who are new to crypto. Regulatory Oversight: Being regulated products, Spot ETH ETFs operate under the oversight of financial authorities, providing a layer of investor protection and transparency that might be lacking in direct crypto investments. For the Broader Market: Mainstream Validation: The success of Spot ETH ETFs lends further legitimacy to Ethereum and the broader cryptocurrency market in the eyes of traditional finance. It signals that digital assets are maturing into a recognized asset class. Increased Capital Inflows: By attracting significant institutional and retail capital, these ETFs inject substantial liquidity into the Ethereum ecosystem, potentially supporting price stability and further development. Enhanced Price Discovery: As more capital flows through regulated channels, the price discovery mechanism for Ethereum can become more efficient and robust, reflecting broader market sentiment. Are There Any Challenges or Risks Associated with Spot ETH ETFs? While the benefits are clear, it’s equally important to acknowledge the challenges and risks associated with investing in Spot ETH ETFs . No investment is without its potential downsides, and digital assets, despite their growing maturity, still carry unique considerations. Market Volatility: Ethereum, like other cryptocurrencies, is known for its price volatility. While ETFs provide indirect exposure, their value will still fluctuate significantly with the price of ETH. Investors should be prepared for potential rapid price swings. Regulatory Evolution: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies and related products is still evolving globally. Changes in regulations could impact the operations, liquidity, or even the existence of Spot ETH ETFs . Custody Risks (Though Minimized): While ETF providers offer enhanced security, the underlying assets are still digital and subject to the inherent risks of the digital realm, such as hacking or technological failures, though these are mitigated by professional custody solutions. Tracking Error: Like all ETFs, there can be a slight tracking error between the ETF’s performance and the performance of its underlying asset. While generally minimal, it’s a factor to consider. Competition and Fees: The market for crypto ETFs is becoming increasingly competitive, which can lead to fee pressures. Investors should be mindful of expense ratios, as these can impact long-term returns. What Actionable Insights Can We Glean from Spot ETH ETFs’ Performance? The remarkable performance of Spot ETH ETFs in July offers several key takeaways for investors, market observers, and even blockchain developers. These insights can help shape future strategies and expectations within the digital asset space. The significant inflows into Spot ETH ETFs highlight growing institutional confidence in Ethereum. Confirmation of Institutional Appetite: The sheer volume of inflows confirms that institutional investors are not just dabbling but actively allocating significant capital to Ethereum through regulated products. This signals a shift from speculative interest to strategic portfolio inclusion. Ethereum’s Growing Prominence: While Bitcoin often leads the crypto narrative, the strong performance of Spot ETH ETFs underscores Ethereum’s unique and indispensable position in the digital economy. Its utility as a platform for decentralized applications, smart contracts, and Web3 innovation is increasingly recognized. Market Maturation Continues: The smooth launch and rapid growth of these ETFs indicate a continued maturation of the cryptocurrency market. As more traditional financial products emerge, the barrier to entry for conventional investors decreases, leading to broader adoption. Potential for Future Growth: The current inflows might just be the beginning. As more investors become aware of and comfortable with Spot ETH ETFs , and as Ethereum’s ecosystem continues to expand, further substantial capital inflows could be expected. This could lead to increased liquidity and potentially more stable price action for ETH in the long run. These insights collectively paint a picture of a digital asset market that is steadily integrating into the global financial system, with Spot ETH ETFs playing a pivotal role in this transformation. Looking Ahead: The Future Trajectory of Spot ETH ETFs The record-setting $5.43 billion net inflows into Spot ETH ETFs in July represent a powerful milestone. This unprecedented surge not only highlights growing investor confidence in Ethereum but also underscores the increasing integration of digital assets into mainstream financial products. From providing accessible investment avenues to bolstering market liquidity and validating Ethereum’s foundational role, these ETFs are reshaping the investment landscape. While challenges like market volatility and evolving regulations persist, the overall trend suggests a robust future for Spot ETH ETFs . Their continued success will likely attract even more capital, further legitimizing Ethereum as a crucial component of diversified investment portfolios. As the digital asset space continues to innovate and mature, Spot ETH ETFs are poised to remain a key indicator of institutional and retail sentiment, driving the next wave of adoption and growth. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly are Spot ETH ETFs? A: Spot ETH ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) are investment funds that hold actual Ethereum (ETH) as their underlying asset. They trade on traditional stock exchanges, allowing investors to gain exposure to Ethereum’s price movements without directly buying and holding the cryptocurrency themselves. Q2: Why are Spot ETH ETF inflows considered important? A: Significant inflows into Spot ETH ETFs indicate strong demand from institutional and retail investors. This signals growing mainstream acceptance, increased liquidity, and a validation of Ethereum as a legitimate and investable asset class within regulated financial markets. Q3: How do Spot ETH ETFs compare to Bitcoin ETFs? A: Both Spot ETH ETFs and Bitcoin ETFs offer indirect exposure to their respective cryptocurrencies through traditional brokerage accounts. Bitcoin ETFs were approved first and have seen significant success, paving the way for ETH ETFs. While both are subject to crypto market volatility, ETH ETFs provide exposure to Ethereum’s unique ecosystem, which focuses on smart contracts and decentralized applications, differentiating it from Bitcoin’s primary role as digital gold. Q4: What factors primarily influence Spot ETH ETF performance? A: The performance of Spot ETH ETFs is primarily influenced by the price of Ethereum (ETH) itself. Other factors include overall cryptocurrency market sentiment, global economic conditions, regulatory developments, and the specific supply and demand dynamics for the ETF shares. Q5: Is investing in Spot ETH ETFs safe? A: While Spot ETH ETFs offer enhanced security and regulatory oversight compared to direct crypto ownership, they are still subject to the inherent volatility and risks of the underlying cryptocurrency market. Investors should conduct thorough research and consider their risk tolerance before investing. Share Your Insights Did you find this deep dive into Spot ETH ETFs insightful?

Investors reacted to a stronger dollar and renewed geopolitical tensions fanned by US President Donald Trump’s sweeping new tariffs. Bitcoin briefly dipped to $114.2K zone before clawing back to trade above $115k. Ethereum, one of the biggest gainers of the last month, mirrored the BTC move. ETH price plunged straight from $3,860 to $3,600. The volatility came as the US Dollar Index (DXY) surged past 100, its highest level since May. The jump was fueled by safe-haven demand and tightening global liquidity conditions. $758M liquidated as bulls get burned The cumulative digital assets market cap dropped by around 4% to stand at $3.74 trillion. However, its 24-hour trading volume spiked by 12% to hit $195 billion. CoinGlass data shows that the ongoing sell-off sparked $758 million in liquidations across crypto markets in the last 24 hours, wiping out over 183,000 traders. The largest single liquidation of $13.79 million ETHUSD_PERP occurred on Binance. Source: Coinglass Data Data shows that $706.6 million (93%) of all the liquidated positions turned out to be long bets. This suggests that traders were hoping that the crypto market would continue its bull run in August, but it went the other way. The fear and greed index stood neutral, looking for the next move. Bitcoin price dropped by more than 3% in the last 24 hours. BTC is trading at an average price of $115,035 at press time. As per Cryptoquant, Bitcoin just saw its third major profit-taking wave of this bull run. The realized profits spiked to $6 billion to $8 billion in late July. This was on par with March and December 2024 peaks. It highlighted that new whales led the selling above $120K. Trump tariffs slam crypto Altcoins also nosedived with Bitcoin. XRP and Solana prices dipped by more than 7% each, while Cardano and SUI dropped by 8% and 10% respectively. The biggest meme crypto, Dogecoin, is trading down by 9% at $0.205 at press time. The largest altcoin, Ethereum, is down by 6%, trading at $3,627. CryptoQuant noted that altcoin futures are exploding even as Bitcoin dominance plateaus. Altcoins now represent 83% of total futures volume, with Ethereum up 170% from recent lows and just 23% off its all-time high. Meanwhile, activity from retail investors appears to be picking up. BTC transactions under $10,000 rose nearly 10% over the past month. Trump announced a 10% global minimum tariff and 15% with duties for countries with trade surpluses against the US. Global markets are extending selloff as investors grapple with the economic fallout of Trump’s sweeping new tariffs . However, they also brace for a potentially weak US jobs report. Economists expect only 100,000 new jobs added in July and for unemployment to tick up to 4.2%. Futures on the S&P 500 dropped nearly 1% early Friday. This points to a fourth straight day of declines, while Amazon tumbled over 8% in premarket trading after its earnings disappointed investors. Even as megacap tech firms like Microsoft and Meta posted solid earnings, their performances failed to lift market sentiment.

2025-08-01T11:15:00,"Bitcoin Slides as Rate-Cut Hopes Fade: Crypto Daybook Americas","By Francisco Rodrigues (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) The wind seems to be coming out of the crypto market's sails. Bitcoin (BTC) fell 3% in the past 24 hours, dropping below $115,000, and it's actually one of the better performing of the largest cryptocurrencies. The CoinDesk 20 ( CD20 ) index, a measure of the broader market, fell 6% with ether (ETH) down 5.7% after posting its strongest monthly gain in three years and XRP (XRP) losing more than 7%. The drop comes as some of President Donald Trump’s tariffs started taking effect with more due to kick in on Aug. 7. The levies range from 10% to 41% on imports from key trading partners including Canada, the European Union and Japan. That sent Asian equity markets to their worst week since April and fueled a rally in the U.S. dollar, sending the dollar index above 100 for the first time since May. The tariffs also pushed up the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure, the core PCE , to 2.8% year-over-year in June. That increase has dampened hopes for a reduction in interest rates in September. Polymarket traders moved from a perceived 56% chance of a rate cut to now 38%. The CME’s FedWatch tool shows a 39% chance. ""For crypto, looser financial conditions would be a major tailwind,” said 21Shares strategist Matt Mena in an emailed statement. Today’s nonfarm payrolls data could be decisive. The report is expected to the U.S. economy created 110,000 jobs last month. Options traders are already seeking protection from further declines. “We’re seeing increased short-term bearish positioning on BTC with capped upside strategies,” said Jake Ostrovskis, an OTC trader at Wintermute. “ETH options into late August are notably different, with positioning balanced to even outright bullish.” If economic data points to higher rates for longer, traders may pivot toward assets that benefit from tighter conditions. A stronger dollar and higher interest rates could nudge investors toward yield-bearing stablecoins or transparent ETH-based vaults, given the GENIUS Act’s passage into law. Stay alert!

The total market capitalization of NFTs has almost doubled to $6.4 billion in just a month, according to CoinGecko data . The rally was led by the CryptoPunks, which rose 33.3% over the period. Other collections, such as the Pudgy Penguins, also helped. CryptoPunks' increase took it near 30% of the total market capitalization of the NFT sector. In ETH terms, the 52 ETH price is the highest in over a year. Derivatives Positioning The number of open contracts in CME bitcoin standard futures has dropped to 27,699, representing 138,495 BTC, the lowest since April. The capital flight could be institutions preferring spot ETFs over futures or traders scaling back exposure as the dollar's rally gathers speed. Open interest in ether futures has fallen to 32,903 contracts from the recent high of 41,636. The ether contract is sized at 50 ETH. BTC and ETH OI remains elevated near record highs in offshore perpetual futures, with funding rates receding to under 5%, a sign of weakening of bullish sentiment. On Deribit, the market sentiment has shifted against ether, with downside insurance premiums costlier than for bitcoin.

2025-08-01T11:10:10,"Bitcoin Price Drop Warning: Crucial Support at $105K Looms","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Drop Warning: Crucial Support at $105K Looms The cryptocurrency market often moves with rapid shifts, and for Bitcoin, understanding these movements is key. Recent data from Sentora, a prominent DeFi analytics layer, suggests a potential Bitcoin Price Drop could be on the horizon. This analysis delves into the on-chain metrics that indicate where Bitcoin might find its next major support, providing clarity on the current market dynamics. Decoding the Sentora Report: A Looming Bitcoin Price Drop? Sentora, previously known as IntoTheBlock, has shared insights that capture the attention of investors. Their recent report on X highlighted a specific metric: 7.9% of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply is currently held at a loss. This figure is not just a statistic; it points to a significant amount of accumulation that took place at higher price points, specifically between the current market price and approximately $121,000. What does ‘at a loss’ mean? It means these Bitcoin holders acquired their BTC at prices higher than the current market value, and if they were to sell now, they would incur a loss. Accumulation patterns: The fact that such a large percentage of supply is at a loss suggests that a substantial volume of Bitcoin was bought during periods of higher price enthusiasm. Market sentiment indicator: This metric can signal potential selling pressure if prices continue to decline, as some holders might choose to cut their losses. This data serves as an early warning sign for a potential Bitcoin Price Drop , prompting market participants to re-evaluate their strategies and risk exposure. The $105K Threshold: A Critical Bitcoin Support Level While the immediate data points to potential downside, Sentora’s analysis also identifies a critical zone where a major support could form. This zone is around the $105,000 mark. The significance of this level comes from the fact that approximately 900,000 BTC was previously acquired within this price range. This historical accumulation suggests a strong base of demand. When a large volume of an asset is acquired at a particular price level, that level often acts as a robust support. If the price falls to this zone, it can encounter buying interest from those who previously accumulated there, or from new investors looking for an entry point. This could potentially halt a further Bitcoin Price Drop . Price Range BTC Volume / Supply Market Implication Current Price to $121,000 7.9% of Circulating Supply Holders at a Loss, Potential Selling Pressure Around $105,000 ~900,000 BTC Acquired Strong Historical Support Zone, Potential Demand Understanding these levels helps in forming a clearer picture of Bitcoin’s immediate future and where its price might stabilize. Navigating the Waters: Strategies for a Potential Bitcoin Price Drop For investors, market downturns, even potential ones, present both challenges and opportunities. Preparing for a potential Bitcoin Price Drop involves careful planning and a disciplined approach. It is not about reacting to every market fluctuation, but about having a strategy. Key Strategies: Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of investing a lump sum, spreading investments over time can reduce the impact of volatility. This strategy allows you to buy more Bitcoin when prices are low and less when they are high, averaging out your purchase price. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Setting stop-loss orders can help limit potential losses if the price falls below a certain point. Diversification: While Bitcoin is a major asset, diversifying your portfolio across different cryptocurrencies or asset classes can mitigate risk. Research and Due Diligence (DYOR): Always conduct your own research. Understand the fundamentals of Bitcoin, read reputable analyses, and avoid making decisions based on hype or fear. The challenge often lies in managing emotions during volatile periods. Fear can lead to panic selling, while greed can lead to irrational buying. A calm, data-driven approach is always recommended. Historical Precedents: Bitcoin’s Resilience Through Drops Bitcoin’s history is marked by significant price swings. From its early days, it has experienced numerous large corrections, often followed by periods of strong recovery. These past events offer valuable context when considering a potential Bitcoin Price Drop . For example, Bitcoin has seen multiple instances where its value dropped by 50% or more from its peak. Yet, each major downturn has historically been followed by a new all-time high. This pattern does not guarantee future results, but it highlights the asset’s resilience and its ability to rebound over the long term. Understanding this historical context can help investors maintain perspective. Short-term fluctuations are a natural part of the crypto market. The underlying technology, growing adoption, and increasing institutional interest continue to build a strong foundation for Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. What Lies Beyond the Immediate Bitcoin Price Drop Concerns? While the short-term outlook might include a potential Bitcoin Price Drop to $105,000, it is crucial to consider the broader landscape. Several factors continue to shape Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory: Halving Events: The recurring Bitcoin halving events reduce the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market, historically leading to price appreciation over time. Institutional Adoption: Increasing interest from large financial institutions, including the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, brings more capital and credibility to the asset. Technological Advancements: Continuous development within the Bitcoin ecosystem, such as the Lightning Network, improves scalability and utility. Global Macroeconomic Factors: Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty, attracting investors seeking alternative stores of value. These long-term drivers suggest that while short-term corrections are possible, the fundamental growth narrative for Bitcoin remains intact. Investors often look beyond immediate price movements to the asset’s role in a changing financial world. Summary: Navigating Bitcoin’s Path Forward The latest analysis from Sentora provides important insights into Bitcoin’s current market position. With 7.9% of its supply currently at a loss, and a significant accumulation zone identified around $105,000, investors are presented with both potential risks and opportunities. A Bitcoin Price Drop to this level could test market resolve, but also offer a chance for new entries. Understanding these on-chain metrics, coupled with a disciplined investment approach, can help navigate the inherent volatility of the crypto market. While short-term movements are always uncertain, Bitcoin’s historical resilience and its evolving role in the global financial system continue to underpin its long-term appeal. Staying informed and making rational decisions based on data, rather than emotion, remains paramount. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What did the Sentora report indicate about Bitcoin? Sentora reported that 7.9% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply is currently held at a loss, indicating that a significant amount of BTC was acquired at higher prices, potentially leading to selling pressure if a Bitcoin Price Drop occurs. 2. Why is $105,000 considered a critical support level for Bitcoin? Approximately 900,000 BTC was previously acquired around the $105,000 price level. This large volume of historical accumulation suggests a strong demand zone where the price could find significant support and potentially bounce back. 3. What does it mean for Bitcoin holders to be ‘at a loss’? When Bitcoin holders are ‘at a loss,’ it means the current market price of their BTC is lower than the price at which they originally purchased it. If they were to sell, they would realize a financial loss. 4. How can investors prepare for a potential Bitcoin Price Drop? Investors can prepare by implementing strategies like Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA), setting stop-loss orders to manage risk, diversifying their portfolios, and conducting thorough research (DYOR) to make informed decisions. 5. Is a Bitcoin Price Drop to $105K inevitable? No, market predictions are not guarantees. The Sentora report highlights a potential scenario based on current on-chain data. Bitcoin’s price movements are influenced by numerous factors, and while $105,000 is a strong support level, market dynamics can change. 6. What is the long-term outlook for Bitcoin despite short-term concerns? Despite potential short-term fluctuations, the long-term outlook for Bitcoin remains positive due to factors like recurring halving events, increasing institutional adoption, continuous technological advancements, and its growing role as a hedge against inflation.

2025-08-01T11:06:03,"BlackRock Ripple (XRP) ETF Coming Soon? Here’s What You Need to Know","Nate Geraci, President of The ETF Store, believes that the world’s largest asset manager – BlackRock – will file for an XRP ETF. If true and if history is any indicator, this could have a long-term positive impact on XRP as an asset, following in the footsteps of ETH and even BTC. BlackRock XRP ETF a Possibility According to Expert Geraci believes that it’s only logical for BlackRock to file for an XRP ETF. He cited the asset manager’s attempt to position itself as a “thought leader,” and thinks that it wouldn’t make a lot of sense for the financial behemmoth to ignore a top-five non-stablecoin cryptocurrency by means of total market capitalization. He also thinks the firm will file for a spot Solana (SOL) ETF. He also believes that they will be filing for an index-based crypto ETF: If launching index-based crypto ETF (which I’m highly confident they will), then you’re launching individual spot ETFs. I get the “BlackRock is all in on ETH,” or “they think XRP is scam.” This is all about business. They open up flank not pursuing additional spot ETFs IMO. To this, he also added that by failing to add more individual spot ETFs, BlackRrock would essentially send a message to their clients and prospective investors that “there will only ever be two winners in crypto: BTC and ETH.” He also said that they are still early because one of their main competitors is still following the “blockchain, not bitcoin” meta. Sticking w/ prediction that BlackRock will launch both xrp & sol ETFs… Doesn’t make sense that world’s largest asset manager (& current leader in both spot btc & eth ETFs) would ignore two top 5 non-stablecoin crypto assets. I also expect them to launch index-based crypto ETF. — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) August 1, 2025 XRP ETFs The New Meta? It’s perhaps safe to assume that a major deterrent for large-scale asset managers to file for XRP ETFs was the ambiguity surrounding its legal status amid the case between the US Securities and Exchange Commission and Ripple Labs. Now that this has almost been resolved, and following the Commission’s newfound crypto-oriented focus, investors and asset managers are far more confident in the US-based crypto company. This has also largely been reflected in XRP’s price, which is up by a staggering 400% in the last year. Multiple companies have already filed for a spot XRP ETF, including Franklin Templeton, Bitwise, Canary Capital, Grayscale, 21Sharse, and WisdomTree. The post BlackRock Ripple (XRP) ETF Coming Soon?

2025-08-01T11:03:26,"Metaplanet files $3.69 billion stock plan to fund 210,000-Bitcoin target by 2027","Japanese Bitcoin investment firm Metaplanet has set out one of the most ambitious financing plans in the digital asset sector, filing a shelf registration on August 1 to raise up to 555 billion yen ($3.6 billion). The company intends to use proceeds from a two-year issuance of perpetual preferred stock to fund its acquisition of 210,000 Bitcoin by 2027. The strategy would increase its current holdings more than thirteen times, positioning the Tokyo-listed company as one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin, second only to MicroStrategy. Metaplanet Inc. @Metaplanet_JP · Follow *Metaplanet Announces EGM Agenda: Proposes Authorization of Perpetual Preferred Stock—Class A (Senior, Non-Convertible) and Class B (Convertible); Files ¥555 Billion Shelf Registration for Potential Issuance* 12:39 PM · Aug 1, 2025 291 Reply Copy link Read 16 replies Share structure changes target diverse investor demand Metaplanet has proposed amendments to increase its authorised shares to 2.72 billion and create two classes of perpetual preferred stock. Class A shares would function like corporate bonds, offering dividend rates of up to 6% and liquidation priority, while Class B shares would include conversion rights into common stock via put options. Neither class carries voting rights. The company announced its plans via a social media post, confirming that the extraordinary general meeting (EGM) scheduled for September 1 will vote on the changes. The shelf registration runs from August 9, 2025, to August 8, 2027, and no issuance will take place without shareholder approval and regulatory clearance. Trading activity has surged alongside these developments. In June, Metaplanet’s stock recorded 1.86 trillion yen ($12.65 billion) in turnover, almost double May’s 997.6 billion yen. The company’s shares have climbed more than 345% year-to-date, fuelled by investors seeking Bitcoin exposure amid declining Japanese bond values. Bitcoin accumulation accelerates in 2025 Metaplanet made Bitcoin an official part of its business in December 2024, and its holdings have expanded rapidly. In March, the company held fewer than 4,000 BTC. By July, its reserves reached 17,132 BTC, worth about $2 billion. The company reported a Q2 2025 BTC Yield of 129.4% and a year-to-date return of 430.2% by July 18. Its acquisition pace quickened in July, with two major purchases: 2,205 BTC on July 7 for $238.7 million, and 780 BTC on July 28 for $92.93 million at an average price of $119,136 per coin. Market impact of treasury strategy Metaplanet’s strategy has pushed it into the top five most traded stocks on Tokyo’s prime market since late 2024, surpassing companies such as Toyota and Sony in June. Institutional investors have also taken interest, with Japan’s 30-year government bonds dropping 45% since 2019. The company’s fully diluted share count now exceeds 866 million, after extensive use of stock acquisition rights to finance purchases. To limit further dilution, the perpetual preferred share structure is designed to attract different investor groups—Class A for income-focused participants, and Class B for those seeking equity-linked upside. Bitcoin reserves target by 2027 Despite market doubts, Metaplanet continues to pursue its target of 210,000 BTC by 2027. While this would fall short of MicroStrategy’s current 597,325 BTC, it would significantly increase Japan’s corporate exposure to the cryptocurrency. Legal challenges elsewhere have underscored the risks, with MicroStrategy facing a class action lawsuit in New York from Pomerantz LLP over alleged misrepresentation of its Bitcoin investment strategy. Metaplanet’s use of perpetual preferred stock could help reduce reliance on dilutive share sales, while appealing to both conservative and risk-seeking investors. If successful, it will strengthen the company’s position as a leading proxy for Bitcoin investment in Asia’s capital markets.

2025-08-01T11:00:36,"XRP Army Is Bullish On Recent U.S. Treasury Action","The crypto community, particularly XRP holders, is buzzing after a recent move by the U.S. Treasury Department to repurchase $2 billion in government debt. As noted by prominent crypto analyst STEPH IS CRYPTO on X, this development is being widely viewed as a bullish signal for risk-on assets, including XRP. Treasury Buyback Sends Market Signals On July 30, 2025, the U.S. Treasury announced an expansion of its quarterly debt buyback program, raising the cap from $30 billion to $38 billion. The plan involves repurchasing older, long-dated Treasurys, specifically those maturing in 10 to 30 years. These buybacks, now scheduled to occur twice as frequently, aim to enhance market liquidity and stabilize long-term yields. To fund this effort, the Treasury will issue short-term bills. While overall auction volumes remain steady, this tactical adjustment reflects the government’s attempt to manage its debt profile more actively. Market response was mixed, yields ticked slightly higher, indicating investor caution over the broader implications of this move. BREAKING: U.S. TREASURY BUYS BACK $2 BILLION IN GOVERNMENT DEBT. BULLISH SIGNAL FOR CRYPTO & #XRP pic.twitter.com/z0F4GgBTKi — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 1, 2025 XRP Community Reacts With Optimism According to Steph, the XRP Army sees this buyback initiative as a clear positive. The reasoning is rooted in macroeconomics: government intervention that lowers long-term interest rates tends to increase the appeal of speculative assets such as cryptocurrencies. Lower yields reduce the opportunity cost of holding crypto, potentially driving more capital into digital assets. This sentiment has gained traction across social platforms. Enthusiasts believe such moves signal a softening fiscal stance, which could provide further tailwinds for digital assets, especially those like XRP that are positioned for use in institutional finance and cross-border payments. A Favorable Macro Climate for Crypto The Treasury’s action comes amid a broader shift in the U.S. government’s approach to crypto. Earlier this year, the administration confirmed the establishment of a national crypto reserve , holding over $21 billion in seized digital assets. Additionally, Trump Media & Technology Group disclosed that it now holds $2 billion worth of Bitcoin as part of its treasury strategy. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 These developments, alongside pro-crypto legislation like the GENIUS Act for stablecoins, have further strengthened market confidence. For many in the XRP community, this marks a new phase in U.S. economic policy, one that increasingly accommodates blockchain-based assets. Caution Amid the Hype Despite the enthusiasm, some analysts urge restraint. A $38 billion buyback is small compared to the U.S. government’s massive debt load, which exceeds $15 trillion in intermediate-term Treasuries alone. Moreover, funding buybacks with short-term debt introduces rollover risk, and the broader impact on yields may be limited. While bullish signals are emerging, they are just one piece of a complex macro puzzle. For XRP holders, the Treasury’s move adds fuel to a growing narrative, but long-term gains will ultimately depend on broader adoption and regulatory clarity.

2025-08-01T11:00:07,"SEC Chair Launches ‘Project Crypto’ To Position US As Global Crypto Leader","US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Paul Atkins, recently unveiled a new initiative called “Project Crypto,” aimed at transforming the country into the “crypto capital of the world,” in line with President Donald Trump’s promises to the industry. This announcement , made during his address on Thursday, marks a notable departure from the aggressive enforcement policies of his predecessor, Gary Gensler, who had been criticized for his tough stance on the digital asset industry. SEC Aims To Revitalize US Crypto Market Atkins’ speech follows the release of a comprehensive 166-page report from the White House on Wednesday that outlines its approach to regulating the cryptocurrency sector. With just over three months in office, Atkins has made it clear that he intends to foster a more supportive regulatory environment for digital assets , contrasting sharply with Gensler’s approach, which many in the industry viewed as overly punitive. During his address, Atkins outlined several priorities for the SEC, including the development of “clear and simple rules of the road” for various crypto activities, such as custody and trading. He also proposed allowing exchanges to evolve into “super-apps,” which would enable them to provide a wider array of services to users. “When our regulatory posture is calibrated to meet innovation with thoughtfulness rather than fear, America’s leadership position has only grown stronger,” Atkins stated, emphasizing a more balanced approach to regulation . Atkins also highlighted the SEC’s goals of bringing crypto activities back to the US, modernizing custody requirements for digital asset holders, and encouraging experimentation with innovative technologies, such as the tokenization of equities. Atkins Begins To Roll Back Gensler’s Actions Under Gensler, the SEC aggressively pursued enforcement actions against leading crypto firms like Binance, Coinbase and Gemini, arguing that they were operating outside established securities laws and posed risks to consumers. This hardline approach followed high-profile failures in the digital asset space. For example, the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX , once run by the now-convicted Sam Bankman-Fried, heightened scrutiny of the industry. In response to Gensler’s policies, the crypto sector mobilized significant resources to support pro-blockchain candidates in the elections, including Donald Trump, who has promised to appoint officials friendly to digital assets. Atkins, a former SEC commissioner and advisor to digital asset projects, is seen as a key figure in this shift toward a more accommodating regulatory environment. Before even taking office, Atkins had already begun to reverse some of Gensler’s actions, a move led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, known as “crypto mom” for her supportive stance on the industry. This included retracting several lawsuits against companies like Coinbase, Uniswap, Robinhood and more, initiating new rulemaking efforts within the regulatory agency. Despite these positive developments, critics remain cautious. Some Gensler supporters warn that a relaxed regulatory framework could lead to a resurgence of fraud and market collapses akin to those seen during earlier boom-and-bust cycles. Dennis Kelleher, CEO of the consumer advocacy group Better Markets, expressed concern that under Atkins, the interests of large financial firms may be prioritized over investor protections.
