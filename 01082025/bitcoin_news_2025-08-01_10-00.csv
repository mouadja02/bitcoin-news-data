2025-08-01T07:50:10,"Metaplanet Bitcoin Strategy: A Bold $3.7 Billion Move for Unprecedented Accumulation","BitcoinWorld Metaplanet Bitcoin Strategy: A Bold $3.7 Billion Move for Unprecedented Accumulation In a groundbreaking move that underscores the growing institutional confidence in digital assets, Metaplanet, a Japan-listed company, is making headlines with its ambitious Metaplanet Bitcoin accumulation strategy. The firm recently announced a significant proposal to issue perpetual preferred shares, aiming to raise a staggering ¥555 billion ($3.7 billion) to bolster its Bitcoin treasury. This strategic maneuver is not just a ripple but a potential tidal wave in the corporate adoption of Bitcoin, signaling a bold commitment to the future of finance. What is Metaplanet’s Bold Bitcoin Accumulation Plan? Metaplanet’s proposed issuance of perpetual preferred shares represents a pivotal step in its long-term vision. The company, already recognized for embracing Bitcoin as a core treasury asset, revealed its intent to hold an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) to secure approval for this substantial capital raise. This initiative is directly aligned with their previously stated goal of accumulating an impressive 210,000 BTC by 2027. Strategic Funding: The ¥555 billion ($3.7 billion) shelf registration provides a flexible framework for Metaplanet to issue preferred shares, enabling them to raise capital over time as market conditions are favorable. Long-Term Vision: Unlike short-term trading, Metaplanet’s strategy is focused on long-term accumulation, positioning Bitcoin as a foundational asset for future growth and stability. Transparency and Governance: Holding an EGM demonstrates a commitment to corporate governance, involving shareholders in this significant strategic shift. This proactive approach to funding its Metaplanet Bitcoin strategy distinguishes the company, setting a precedent for how traditional corporations can integrate digital assets into their core financial operations. Why is Metaplanet Embracing Bitcoin as a Core Asset? Metaplanet’s decision to pivot towards Bitcoin as a primary treasury asset is rooted in several compelling macroeconomic and financial considerations. It reflects a growing trend among forward-thinking corporations seeking alternatives to traditional fiat currencies and conventional investment vehicles. Reason for Bitcoin Adoption Explanation Inflation Hedge Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins makes it a potential safeguard against currency debasement and rising inflation, preserving purchasing power over time. Digital Gold Narrative Increasingly viewed as a store of value, similar to gold, but with the added benefits of digital portability and divisibility. Long-Term Growth Potential Belief in Bitcoin’s continued appreciation as adoption grows and its network effects strengthen, offering significant capital gains potential. Diversification Provides diversification away from traditional financial assets, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk in volatile markets. This strategic rationale aligns with other pioneering companies like MicroStrategy, which has aggressively accumulated Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset. Metaplanet’s embrace of Metaplanet Bitcoin is a testament to a growing conviction that digital assets are not just speculative ventures but essential components of a modern, resilient corporate treasury. How Does Preferred Stock Issuance Support Metaplanet’s Bitcoin Vision? The choice of perpetual preferred shares as a funding mechanism is crucial to understanding Metaplanet’s long-term strategy. Preferred shares typically offer a fixed dividend payment and have priority over common stock in receiving dividends and assets in case of liquidation. Perpetual means they have no maturity date, providing a continuous source of capital without the need for repayment of principal. Non-Dilutive for Common Shareholders (Initially): While preferred shares do represent ownership, they do not typically carry voting rights and are distinct from common equity, potentially reducing immediate dilution concerns for existing common shareholders. Stable Capital Source: Perpetual nature provides long-term, stable funding for ongoing Bitcoin accumulation, reducing reliance on volatile operational cash flows. Investor Appeal: Preferred shares can appeal to investors seeking fixed income or stable returns, attracting a different pool of capital than traditional equity or debt. This financing method allows Metaplanet to acquire significant amounts of Bitcoin without immediately diluting the ownership stake of its existing common shareholders. It’s a sophisticated financial engineering approach to fund a cutting-edge digital asset strategy, further solidifying the company’s commitment to its Metaplanet Bitcoin vision. Potential Benefits and Challenges of Metaplanet’s Bitcoin Strategy Every bold strategy comes with its own set of potential benefits and challenges. Metaplanet’s move into substantial Bitcoin accumulation is no exception. Understanding these facets is key to appreciating the full scope of their undertaking. Benefits: Potential for Significant Upside: If Bitcoin continues its long-term upward trajectory, Metaplanet stands to gain substantial value, potentially boosting its balance sheet significantly. Increased Visibility and Brand Recognition: Being a leading Bitcoin adopter in Japan enhances Metaplanet’s profile, attracting investors and talent interested in innovative financial strategies. Diversification of Treasury Assets: Moving away from traditional cash holdings offers a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation, especially in an era of expansive monetary policies. Challenges: Bitcoin Price Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its price swings. A significant downturn could impact Metaplanet’s balance sheet and investor confidence. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Future regulations in Japan or elsewhere could impact the feasibility or profitability of their strategy. Market Liquidity for Large Holdings: Accumulating and potentially liquidating 210,000 BTC is a massive undertaking that requires deep market liquidity to avoid significant price impact. Perpetual Share Burden: While offering stable capital, the perpetual dividend payments represent an ongoing financial commitment for the company, regardless of Bitcoin’s performance. Metaplanet is navigating these complexities with a clear long-term perspective, betting on Bitcoin’s enduring value proposition. Their strategy reflects a calculated risk, aiming for substantial rewards by embracing the future of finance with Metaplanet Bitcoin . What Are the Implications for Japanese Corporations and Bitcoin Adoption? Metaplanet’s aggressive Metaplanet Bitcoin strategy could serve as a powerful catalyst for broader institutional adoption in Japan and potentially across Asia. Japan, a country with a sophisticated financial market and a history of technological innovation, has often been a bellwether for global trends. Metaplanet’s public commitment to Bitcoin could encourage other Japanese corporations to explore similar treasury strategies. Increased Institutional Interest: As a publicly traded company, Metaplanet’s success (or challenges) with Bitcoin will be closely watched, providing a real-world case study for other firms. Regulatory Clarity: Increased corporate adoption may prompt regulators to provide clearer guidelines and frameworks for digital asset integration, fostering a more stable environment. Innovation in Corporate Finance: Metaplanet is demonstrating how innovative financing structures can be used to acquire and hold digital assets, potentially inspiring new financial products and services. The ripple effect of Metaplanet’s move could extend beyond treasury management, potentially influencing investment funds, pension funds, and even government policies regarding digital assets. This is not just about one company’s balance sheet; it’s about setting a precedent for a new era of corporate financial strategy in a major global economy. Metaplanet’s proposed $3.7 billion preferred stock issuance to fuel its Metaplanet Bitcoin accumulation strategy is a truly monumental development. It signifies a profound shift in how corporations view and utilize digital assets, moving them from speculative investments to core treasury components. With an ambitious target of 210,000 BTC by 2027, Metaplanet is positioning itself as a pioneer, demonstrating conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition as an inflation hedge and a superior store of value. While challenges like volatility and regulatory uncertainty remain, the potential benefits—including significant capital appreciation and enhanced corporate resilience—are substantial. This bold move by a Japan-listed company could very well accelerate broader institutional adoption of Bitcoin, reshaping corporate finance strategies globally and cementing Bitcoin’s role in the future economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Metaplanet’s primary goal with this $3.7 billion issuance? A1: Metaplanet’s primary goal is to raise significant capital through preferred stock issuance to fund its ambitious Bitcoin accumulation strategy, aiming to acquire 210,000 BTC by 2027 and hold it as a core treasury asset. Q2: How does preferred stock differ from common stock in this context? A2: Preferred stock typically offers fixed dividend payments and has priority over common stock in dividends and liquidation. Crucially, it usually doesn’t carry voting rights, meaning Metaplanet can raise capital without immediately diluting the control of existing common shareholders. Q3: Why is Metaplanet choosing Bitcoin over other assets for its treasury? A3: Metaplanet views Bitcoin as a superior inflation hedge, a digital store of value akin to gold, and an asset with significant long-term growth potential. This aligns with a strategy to protect corporate value against currency debasement and capitalize on the growing digital economy. Q4: What are the main risks associated with Metaplanet’s Bitcoin accumulation strategy? A4: The primary risks include Bitcoin’s inherent price volatility, potential adverse changes in cryptocurrency regulations, the challenge of managing such large holdings, and the ongoing financial commitment of perpetual preferred share dividends. Q5: How might Metaplanet’s strategy impact other Japanese companies? A5: Metaplanet’s bold move could serve as a case study and catalyst for other Japanese corporations, encouraging them to explore or adopt similar Bitcoin treasury strategies, potentially leading to broader institutional adoption in the region.

2025-08-01T07:27:26,"$600M in Longs Wiped as BTC Crashes to 3-Week Low on Trump Tariff Shock","Today, being August 1, means that many of US President Donald Trump’s tariffs against multiple nations are supposed to be enforced, which had a drastic impact on the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin, for one, dropped by several grand in a day to a multi-week low of under $114,500. Trump’s Latest Tariff Adjustments August 1 was a pivotal date for Trump’s global policy, as he had outlined it as a deadline for tariff implementation against numerous nations. On Thursday, the POTUS signed an executive order to change the stipulations. For one, he imposed a 10% tariff on goods imported from every country, aside from the 92 nations listed in an annex that are subject to higher rates. Trump also raised tariffs on Canadian goods from 25% to 35%. “I have determined that it is necessary and appropriate to deal with the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14257 by imposing additional ad valorem duties on goods of certain trading partners,” the POTUS said . Many economic experts rushed to offer their insights on what the actual impact would be on the financial markets, including crypto. The Kobeissi Letter, for instance, noted that the trade war has “lost all credibility.” The market says the trade war has lost all credibility: President Trump just seemingly just randomly decided to raise tariffs on Canada from 25% to 35%. On top of this, he imposed “reciprocal tariffs” on Vietnam, Switzerland, South Africa, Taiwan, Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia,… — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) August 1, 2025 But Crypto Corrects Recall that the entire crypto market plunged hard in April following Trump’s original tariff call. At the time, BTC went from a six-digit territory to a five-month low of under $75,000 within days as the market wiped out nearly half a trillion dollars. The landscape, for now at least, is not as painful, but BTC and the altcoins are still in the red after Trump’s executive order. Bitcoin’s price had recovered to almost $119,000 yesterday after the Fed’s decision to maintain the interest rates, but dumped by more than four grand to a multi-week low of $114,400. Although it has recovered some ground since then, it’s still more than 3% down on the day. The altcoins have it even worse, with ETH and XRP dropping by 6%, while SPX, ENA, CRV, INJ, PENGU, JUP, BONK, SEI, and several others have nosedived by double digits. The total crypto market cap has seen over $150 billion gone since yesterday’s peak and is down to $3.820 trillion on CG. BTCUSD.

2025-08-01T07:25:11,"Bitcoin Price Drop: Urgent Plunge Below $115,000 Sparks Concerns","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Drop: Urgent Plunge Below $115,000 Sparks Concerns The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic arena, often characterized by swift movements. Recently, a significant event has captured the attention of investors worldwide: a notable Bitcoin price drop . According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, the flagship cryptocurrency, BTC, has dipped below the critical $115,000 mark, currently trading at approximately $114,970.31 on the Binance USDT market. This development prompts a closer look at the factors at play and what it could mean for the broader crypto ecosystem. What’s Behind the Recent Bitcoin Price Drop? Understanding the forces driving a Bitcoin price drop requires examining various market indicators and macroeconomic factors. Cryptocurrency markets are highly sensitive, and several elements can contribute to sudden shifts in valuation. Here are some common contributors: Macroeconomic Climate: Global economic uncertainties, inflation concerns, or interest rate hikes by central banks can lead investors to de-risk, moving away from volatile assets like Bitcoin. This often correlates with a broader flight to safety, impacting risk assets globally. Regulatory Developments: News or rumors of stricter cryptocurrency regulations in major economies can create investor apprehension, leading to sell-offs. Uncertainty around new laws or enforcement actions can trigger a swift reaction across the market, contributing to a significant Bitcoin price drop . Whale Movements: Large transactions by significant holders (often termed ‘whales’) can influence market supply and demand, potentially triggering a Bitcoin price drop if substantial amounts are sold. Monitoring on-chain data for large movements can sometimes provide early indicators. Market Sentiment and Technical Indicators: A shift in overall market sentiment, perhaps fueled by negative news or a breach of key technical support levels, can accelerate downward trends. When Bitcoin breaks through established support, it often signals further downside potential, prompting algorithmic trading and retail investor reactions. The $115,000 level may have been a crucial psychological and technical support that, once breached, led to further selling pressure. Liquidation Events: In highly leveraged markets, a downward price movement can trigger liquidations of long positions, creating a cascade effect that further pushes prices down. This phenomenon can exacerbate a natural Bitcoin price drop , leading to rapid declines. How Does This Bitcoin Price Drop Impact Investors? A substantial Bitcoin price drop can evoke a range of reactions from investors, depending on their investment horizon and risk tolerance. For some, it presents a challenge, while for others, it might be an opportunity. Let’s explore the implications: Short-Term Traders: For those engaged in short-term trading, a rapid decline like this can lead to significant losses if positions are not managed effectively. Stop-loss orders are crucial for mitigating risk in such volatile conditions, helping to protect capital during a sharp Bitcoin price drop . Long-Term Holders (HODLers): Many long-term investors view such dips as temporary fluctuations within Bitcoin’s broader growth trajectory. They might see it as an opportunity to accumulate more Bitcoin at a lower price, adhering to the ‘buy the dip’ strategy, believing in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition despite the current Bitcoin price drop . Liquidation Risks: Investors using leverage on exchanges face the risk of their positions being liquidated if the price falls below their margin requirements. This can be a painful consequence of a sudden Bitcoin price drop , especially for those with high leverage. Market Sentiment: Persistent downward pressure can erode overall market confidence, potentially leading to a broader sell-off across altcoins as well, given Bitcoin’s dominant position. A significant Bitcoin price drop often signals a ‘risk-off’ environment for the entire crypto market. To illustrate the typical price movements and potential impact, consider the following simplified market scenario: Market Event Potential Investor Reaction Short-Term Impact Long-Term Outlook Significant Bitcoin Price Drop Panic selling, forced liquidations, ‘buy the dip’ strategies Increased volatility, potential for further declines Opportunity for accumulation, potential for recovery and growth Negative Macro News Risk-off sentiment, shift to safer assets Broader market correction, correlation with traditional markets Temporary setback, underlying fundamentals may remain strong Learn more about market analysis tools that can help you understand price movements. Navigating the Volatility: Strategies After a Bitcoin Price Drop While a Bitcoin price drop can be unsettling, it is also a reminder of the importance of sound investment principles. How can investors navigate these turbulent waters? Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always verify information from multiple reputable sources. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on social media hype or fear. Focus on Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition and adoption trends, especially during a period of Bitcoin price drop . Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, consider investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price. This strategy helps average out your purchase price over time, reducing the impact of short-term volatility and making a Bitcoin price drop less impactful on your overall average. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Diversify your portfolio across different asset classes, not just cryptocurrencies. For traders, utilize stop-loss orders to limit potential downside and protect against unexpected movements during a Bitcoin price drop . Stay Informed: Keep abreast of global economic news, regulatory updates, and technological advancements within the crypto space. Understanding the broader context can help in making informed decisions during a Bitcoin price drop . Maintain a Long-Term Perspective: Historically, Bitcoin has shown resilience and recovery after significant dips. While past performance is not indicative of future results, a long-term outlook can help weather short-term storms and focus on Bitcoin’s potential growth despite a temporary Bitcoin price drop . Remember, market corrections are a natural part of any asset class, including cryptocurrencies. The key is to react thoughtfully rather than emotionally. The recent Bitcoin price drop below $115,000 serves as a stark reminder of the cryptocurrency market’s inherent volatility. While such movements can be alarming, they are also integral to the market’s cycles. Understanding the underlying causes, assessing the impact on various investor profiles, and implementing robust risk management strategies are paramount. For many, this dip might represent a strategic accumulation opportunity, reinforcing the importance of a long-term vision in the dynamic world of digital assets. Staying informed, exercising patience, and adhering to a well-thought-out investment plan are the best ways to navigate these challenging yet potentially rewarding periods. Frequently Asked Questions Q1: What does a Bitcoin price drop below $115,000 signify? A: It signifies a significant downward price movement, potentially driven by market sentiment, macroeconomic factors, or large sell-offs. For many, it indicates a breach of a psychological or technical support level, prompting further scrutiny of market conditions and highlighting the current Bitcoin price drop . Q2: Is this Bitcoin price drop a good time to buy? A: For long-term investors, a significant Bitcoin price drop can be seen as an opportunity to buy at a lower price, often referred to as ‘buying the dip’. However, this depends on individual risk tolerance and investment strategy. It is crucial to conduct your own research (DYOR) before making any investment decisions. Q3: How long do Bitcoin price drops typically last? A: The duration of a Bitcoin price drop can vary widely, from a few days to several months, depending on the underlying causes and broader market conditions. There is no fixed timeline, and historical performance does not guarantee future results. Q4: What should I do if my crypto portfolio is down due to this Bitcoin price drop? A: It is important to avoid panic selling. Revisit your original investment thesis, assess your risk exposure, and consider strategies like dollar-cost averaging. If you are over-leveraged, managing your positions promptly is critical. Staying informed and consulting with a financial advisor, if needed, can also be beneficial during a Bitcoin price drop . Q5: Are there specific indicators to watch during a Bitcoin price drop? A: Yes, key indicators include trading volume (to gauge selling pressure), funding rates (for derivatives markets), on-chain metrics (like exchange inflows/outflows), and macroeconomic news (e.g., inflation data, interest rate announcements). Monitoring these can provide insights into market dynamics during a Bitcoin price drop . Did this article help you understand the recent Bitcoin price drop and its implications?

2025-08-01T07:15:10,"Crypto Blockchain Industries Bitcoin: Ambitious Plan to Acquire 2,000 BTC","BitcoinWorld Crypto Blockchain Industries Bitcoin: Ambitious Plan to Acquire 2,000 BTC In the evolving landscape of digital finance, a significant development is unfolding in Europe. French-listed fintech company, Crypto Blockchain Industries Bitcoin (CBI), is making headlines with its strategic foray into the world’s leading cryptocurrency. This move signals a growing trend of traditional companies embracing digital assets, and CBI’s plans are particularly ambitious. For anyone keenly observing the intersection of traditional finance and the crypto revolution, CBI’s strategy offers a compelling case study. What is Driving Crypto Blockchain Industries Bitcoin Strategy? Crypto Blockchain Industries Bitcoin acquisition strategy is not just a casual dip into the crypto pool; it’s a calculated and growing commitment. According to insights shared by @btcNLNico on X, CBI has already accumulated 21.52 BTC over the last three months, bringing their current total holdings to 25.07 BTC. This initial accumulation serves as a foundation for a much larger vision. The company has also announced a pivotal strategic partnership with SAFEbit, a Turkish crypto platform, which paves the way for a truly remarkable future purchase target: up to 2,000 BTC. This phased approach to Bitcoin acquisition suggests a well-thought-out plan rather than impulsive buying. It allows CBI to gradually integrate Bitcoin into its balance sheet, potentially mitigating some of the immediate volatility risks while positioning itself for long-term growth in the digital asset space. How Does This Acquisition Compare to Others? CBI’s target of up to 2,000 BTC, while substantial for a company of its size and market position, can be put into perspective by looking at other notable institutional Bitcoin holders. While it may not reach the colossal holdings of a MicroStrategy or a Tesla, it certainly places CBI among a growing list of public companies diversifying into Bitcoin. This move by Crypto Blockchain Industries Bitcoin is a clear indicator that the appetite for digital assets among publicly traded entities is expanding beyond the early adopters. Company Primary Industry Approximate BTC Holdings (Examples) Motivation for Holding BTC MicroStrategy Business Intelligence >200,000 BTC Primary Treasury Reserve Asset Tesla Automotive & Energy ~9,720 BTC (as of Q4 2023) Balance Sheet Diversification Crypto Blockchain Industries (CBI) Fintech, Blockchain, Gaming 25.07 BTC (current), up to 2,000 BTC (future) Strategic Investment, Partnership Synergy What are the Potential Benefits for CBI and the Crypto Market? The decision by Crypto Blockchain Industries Bitcoin to make such a substantial investment carries multiple potential benefits, both for the company itself and for the broader cryptocurrency market: Balance Sheet Enhancement: Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a store of value, akin to digital gold. Holding BTC can potentially hedge against inflation and provide a long-term appreciating asset on CBI’s balance sheet. Increased Investor Appeal: For investors looking for exposure to the crypto market through regulated entities, CBI’s Bitcoin holdings could make it a more attractive investment vehicle. It signals a forward-thinking and innovative approach. Strategic Partnerships and Synergies: The partnership with SAFEbit is crucial. It suggests CBI is not just buying Bitcoin, but also leveraging expertise and infrastructure from established crypto platforms. This could lead to further collaborations and product development within the crypto space. Market Validation: Each new company, especially a publicly listed one, that publicly announces Bitcoin acquisition plans adds another layer of legitimacy and validation to the asset class. This can encourage other hesitant traditional businesses to consider similar moves. Pioneering in Europe: As a French-listed company, CBI’s move could inspire other European firms to follow suit, fostering greater institutional adoption of Bitcoin across the continent. A cartoon illustration of a large hand representing Crypto Blockchain Industries, placing a Bitcoin coin into a digital piggy bank, symbolizing investment and growth. Are There Any Challenges or Risks Involved? While the prospects for Crypto Blockchain Industries Bitcoin strategy appear promising, it’s important to acknowledge the inherent challenges and risks associated with holding a volatile asset like Bitcoin: Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is known for its significant fluctuations. Large holdings mean that CBI’s balance sheet could experience considerable swings in value, impacting its reported financials. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, particularly in Europe. Changes in regulations regarding taxation, custody, or usage could impact the value and utility of CBI’s Bitcoin holdings. Security Risks: Holding substantial amounts of cryptocurrency requires robust security measures to prevent hacks, theft, or loss. CBI will need to ensure top-tier cold storage and security protocols are in place, especially given the partnership with a crypto platform. Public Perception: While increasingly accepted, some traditional investors might still view Bitcoin as a speculative asset, potentially affecting CBI’s stock performance if not managed well. CBI’s experience as a fintech company, with its existing blockchain focus, likely provides it with a better understanding of these risks compared to companies without prior crypto exposure. What Does This Mean for the Future of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption? The actions of companies like Crypto Blockchain Industries Bitcoin are critical bellwethers for the broader institutional adoption trend. Their willingness to commit significant capital to Bitcoin, despite market volatility, underscores a growing belief in its long-term value proposition. This is not just about a single company; it’s about a ripple effect that could see more corporations, especially in the fintech and tech sectors, follow suit. The partnership with SAFEbit also highlights an emerging model where traditional companies leverage the expertise and infrastructure of native crypto platforms for their digital asset strategies. This collaborative approach can accelerate adoption and streamline the complexities of managing crypto assets. A Compelling Future for Crypto Blockchain Industries Bitcoin In conclusion, Crypto Blockchain Industries’ ambitious plan to acquire up to 2,000 BTC is a powerful statement. It solidifies their position as a forward-thinking fintech company actively participating in the digital economy. This strategic move, bolstered by a key partnership with SAFEbit, showcases a clear vision for integrating Bitcoin into their financial strategy. As more companies recognize Bitcoin’s potential, CBI’s pioneering efforts in the European market could serve as an influential precedent, further propelling the mainstream acceptance and institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies.

Here's All the Data","Bitcoin closed July at $115,768, marking its first monthly close at this level in its 16-year history. Although the world's largest cryptocurrency fell 2.34% in the last 24 hours, the close was a record. Bitcoin Hits All-Time Monthly Close at $115,768 “Bitcoin closing this month at an all-time high isn’t just a headline; it’s a testament to the market’s resilience and maturation,” said Rachael Lucas, crypto analyst at BTC Markets. Lucas noted that despite the large 80,000 BTC transfer to Galaxy Digital in July and the subsequent sell-off, the price remained stable. While this sell-off caused a brief 4% drop in Bitcoin, the market quickly absorbed the impact. “This level of recovery shows that a strong buyer base has formed in the market that trusts Bitcoin,” Lucas said, emphasizing that Bitcoin remains resilient despite macroeconomic uncertainties during this period of increasing institutional interest. On the other hand, LVRG Research Director Nick Ruck stated that investors can realize profits, and this will depend on the policies of the US Federal Reserve (Fed), Trump's possible tariffs and ETF fund flows. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have experienced outflows in recent days, with the strong inflows of the first half of July seemingly giving way to weaker net flows. However, Ruck stated that the current decline is temporary and that he expects a recovery in August. Lucas emphasized that Bitcoin is in a strong position in the long term: “Bitcoin is increasingly adopted as a scarce, decentralized asset, and its role in the global financial system is strengthening.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-08-01T07:05:44,"Best crypto of the season? This presale token gains 20%, eyes 15% price spike","Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building an ecosystem centered around lending, borrowing, passive income, and a stablecoin that is only minted against real crypto collateral. That structure alone puts it ahead of many tokens offering no clear use. Now, with price momentum growing and a 15% increase locked in for the next presale phase, the window to buy MUTM before it gets significantly more expensive is narrowing fast. mtTokens, stablecoin utility, and a revenue-backed ecosystem At the center of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s future growth is its innovative dual-token architecture. Once the platform goes live, depositors of stablecoins and top-notch coins will receive mtTokens in 1:1 interest-bearing tokens that automatically grow in value as lending demand increases. These tokens are designed to deliver passive income without the need for lockups, auto-compounding strategies, or complex manual management. On the other side, the protocol is preparing to introduce a decentralized stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. What sets it apart is its supply mechanism: new stablecoins will only be minted when loans are issued and will be burned automatically as loans are repaid. This controlled, on-demand issuance model reduces the inflationary risks and de-pegging vulnerabilities seen in other stablecoin systems. Protocol-set interest rates will help regulate demand and sustain the peg over time. Another powerful driver of MUTM’s utility will be its staking ecosystem. Users who stake mtTokens in smart contracts will earn MUTM rewards funded by real protocol revenue. Rather than inflating the token supply, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to execute ongoing buybacks from the open market, then redistribute those MUTM tokens directly to mtToken stakers. This mechanism simultaneously handles the circulating supply and reinforces upward price pressure. The recent 20% uptick in MUTM’s price isn’t a hype-driven anomaly—it reflects growing presale momentum and the expectation of real utility. As each piece of the ecosystem nears launch, more users are entering early, positioning themselves ahead of the next price tier. Phase 6 price still at $0.035, but not for long The presale is now in Phase 6, with MUTM priced at $0.035. Over 14,700 holders have already joined the ecosystem, and 7% of the 170 million tokens allocated to this phase have been sold. Once this round completes, the price will automatically increase to $0.040—a 15% spike that makes the current entry point a strategic bargain for investors looking to lock in before it gets more expensive. One investor swapped out of Bitcoin (BTC) during Phase 2, getting in at just $0.015. Today, that position is up by 133%, and with the launch of staking contracts, beta access, and the stablecoin system on the horizon, returns are set to scale further. This presale isn’t just a funding round—it’s a front-row seat to a DeFi system that prioritizes utility and protocol growth. And this growth is visible in every part of the platform. In the P2C lending model, users supplying stablecoins like USDT or blue-chip tokens like ETH are already earning double-digit APYs (based on pool utilization). For example, a lender providing $10,000 worth of USDT into a high-demand pool earning 14.2% APY will generate $1,420 per year in passive income, automatically compounding through the mtToken structure. On the borrowing side, a user locking $15,000 worth of SOL as collateral with a 70% LTV can immediately borrow $10,500 in stablecoins, with rates dynamically adjusted based on pool usage and collateral type. These are practical, working DeFi mechanisms—not hypothetical promises. The platform also supports P2P lending, where users can set terms directly and trade risk for yield. While P2P models suit more aggressive investors, the infrastructure gives both risk-averse and high-risk traders tools that most projects don’t even plan for. CertiK audit, $100K giveaway, and limited time before listing price hits $0.06 Security is a non-negotiable for serious DeFi investors, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already passed a rigorous CertiK audit. With a Token Scan Score of 95.00 and Skynet rating of 78.00, the protocol is not only functional—it’s battle-tested. A $50,000 bug bounty program is live, inviting developers to probe the system before full launch. And to sweeten the presale, a $100,000 giveaway is underway. Ten lucky winners will receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens, just for participating during the current phase. With the listing price confirmed at $0.06, entering at $0.035 today means investors are buying in at a 70% discount to the initial exchange price. That’s a difference only early movers will enjoy—because once the next phase kicks in and then listing goes live, this opportunity will be gone. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is checking every box: smart tokenomics, working DeFi products in process, deep incentives, and sustainable yield. The breakout has already started—those waiting will just end up paying more.

2025-08-01T07:04:26,"Goldman Sachs Executive Forecasts Further US Dollar Decline, Says He’s ‘Super Bullish’ on Stocks – Here’s Why","A Goldman Sachs top executive believes the value of the US dollar has further to fall while predicting stocks may reach new all-time highs. In a new analysis, Ashok Varadhan, Goldman’s co-head of global banking and markets, says that gold and Bitcoin ( BTC ) may be an effective hedge against currency devaluation amid a ballooning national budget deficit. “Many investors have become more bearish on the US dollar amid fiscal concerns, and Goldman Sachs Research expects further depreciation in the currency. But Varadhan points out that the US isn’t the only developed market with an unusually large budget deficit. The US budget deficit this year is estimated to be about 6% of GDP, while the deficit of France is 5.5%, and the UK 3.6%, according to Goldman Sachs Research. Varadhan suggests that assets like gold and Bitcoin could climb relative to fiat currencies.” Varadhan also says that stocks may continue in an uptrend because President Trump’s reduction in government regulations may help stimulate the economy and advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) may help companies generate larger profits. “Varadhan says he’s ‘super bullish’ on equities, even though they’ve reached all-time highs. There’s a tailwind to the US economy from deregulation, and it will be crucial to assess whether the US manages a fair recalibration of trade and continues to attract the best, brightest, and most able people to its labor market… We’re not even in the first inning of companies implementing AI. Once that company implementation happens, you get that productivity dividend.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
