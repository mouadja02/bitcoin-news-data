2025-08-01T10:57:59,"Corporate Crypto Frenzy: Firms Move to Buy Over $7.8 Billion in Digital Assets","In what appears to be one of the largest corporate moves into crypto to date, a wave of crypto treasury companies is preparing to purchase over $7.8 billion worth of digital assets this week. Since Monday, 16 companies have either declared intentions to buy crypto or announced fundraising plans geared toward digital asset accumulation, with Ether being the most sought-after. More than $3 billion worth of ETH has been bought or committed to by just five public firms‚Äîroughly 45 times the amount of ETH newly issued this week. The surge marks a rising trend of corporate entities, especially from traditional finance backgrounds, adopting digital asset strategies amid limitations in directly accessing crypto exchange-traded products. Ethereum Steals the Spotlight Amid Corporate Shift Bitcoin miner BTCS Inc. led this week‚Äôs Ethereum charge, filing plans on Tuesday to raise up to $2 billion for ETH purchases. Joe Lubin‚Äôs Sharplink Gaming, already among the largest Ethereum treasury firms , added $338 million worth of ETH across two major transactions earlier this week. Another player, The Ether Machine, acquired 15,000 ETH‚Äîvalued at approximately $57 million‚Äîadding to the bullish ETH momentum. Additionally, two firms underwent full-scale rebranding to reflect their new crypto ambitions. Biotech firm 180 Life Sciences Corp has now become ETHZilla Corporation following a $425 million pivot toward Ethereum. Meanwhile, merchant bank Fundamental Global rebranded to FG Nexus, dedicating $200 million to ETH acquisition. Altcoins in Treasury Crosshairs Meanwhile, a host of altcoins also saw demand. Tron Inc., now controlled by Justin Sun‚Äôs blockchain venture, revealed plans to raise $1 billion to acquire TRX tokens. Three other companies showed interest in tokens like Solana, Sui, and BNB. One standout was CEA Industries, a Canadian vape company repurposed into a BNB-focused treasury firm after a takeover by 10X Capital and YZi Labs. Described as the family office of Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao, the firm aims to raise between $500 million and $1.25 billion to purchase BNB. Tech firm Cemtrex Inc. entered the Solana market with a $1 million purchase and ambitions to grow that to $10 million. Meanwhile, Mill City Ventures III sealed a $450 million pivot to Sui token investments. Bitcoin Not Behind Bitcoin wasn‚Äôt left behind. Seven companies committed or proposed a combined $2.7 billion worth of BTC purchases. Strategy led with a $2.5 billion raise and the acquisition of 21,021 Bitcoin. Others include The Smarter Web Company with $26.5 million spent on 225 BTC, and Metaplanet, which bought 780 BTC for $92 million. ZOOZ Power Ltd., an energy firm, also entered the scene with a $180 million Bitcoin strategy. Still, analysts like Galaxy Research‚Äôs Will Owens warn of valuation risks, noting that investors often apply significantly different premiums based on a company‚Äôs crypto holdings.

2025-08-01T10:56:32,"Why Is Crypto Down Today? ‚Äì August 1, 2025","The crypto market is down today, with not a single green coin over the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency market capitalization has decreased by another 7.3% to $3.83 trillion. At the same time, the total crypto trading volume is at $163 billion. TLDR: Crypto market turned red over the past day, with all top 100 coins turning red; All top 10 coins are down; BTC and ETH saw drops to $115,555 and $3,673, respectively; Institutions cash out as BTC volatility compresses, traders brace for downside; US ETH spot ETFs hit a new inflow streak record with 20 consecutive days; US BTC spot ETFs recorded outflows of $114.83 million; There is a 46% chance BTC hits $150,000 by year‚Äôs end; ETH is expected to remain more volatile than BTC; It‚Äôs realistic to ‚Äòassume that later this year we should get a rate cut or two, which will be great for crypto.‚Äô Crypto Winners & Losers All top 10 coins per market capitalization have decreased over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC) fell by 2.3% in a day and below the $116,000 mark, now trading at $115,555. At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) decreased by 4.8%, now changing hands at $3,673. The highest drop is 7.5% by Dogecoin (DOGE) , which currently changes hands at $0.2061. It‚Äôs followed by Solana (SOL)‚Äôs 6.5% to the price of $169. The smallest drop in this category Tron (TRX) ‚Äôs 03%, changing hands at $0.3254. As for the top 100 coins, five coins recorded double-digit decreases. SPX6900 (SPX) fell the most: 16.3% to $1.64. Ethena (ENA) follows with an 11.8% drop to the price of $0.5732. Jupiter (JUP) , Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) , and Bonk (BONK) also saw double-digit falls. Additionally, according to onchain data firm CryptoQuant , on 31 July, Bitcoin saw its third major profit-taking spike in this bull run. Bitcoin just saw its third major profit-taking wave of this bull run. Realized profits spiked to $6‚Äì8B in late July, on par with March and Dec 2024 peaks. It was new whales who led the selling above $120K. pic.twitter.com/Q4FQkLXcin ‚Äî CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) July 31, 2025 The markets across the board are reacting to the unchanged interest rate by the US Federal Reserve , while the investors keep an eye on the inflation data. Overall, the increased tariff fears amid the ongoing trade deal saga in the US are pulling the prices down. Douglas Colkitt, Initial Fogo Contributor, commented that ‚Äúthe dissenting voices at the Fed are a big deal. It‚Äôs rare ‚Äì and it tells you there‚Äôs serious internal debate about how long the Fed can hold this line without breaking something. For crypto, that uncertainty is fuel. When confidence in policy coherence starts to erode, decentralized assets look a lot more attractive.‚Äù Mike Cahill, CEO of Douro Labs, a contributor to the Pyth Network, added that, ‚Äúin that kind of regime, assets with asymmetric upside and low policy correlation ‚Äì like Bitcoin ‚Äì start to play a more strategic role. We‚Äôre seeing capital rotate not just for yield, but for resiliency in a fractured macro backdrop.‚Äù ‚Äò46% Chance BTC Hits $150,000 by Year‚Äôs End‚Äô Nick Forster, Founder of the decentralized onchain options AI-powered platform Derive.xyz , commented that 30-day BTC volatility has decreased from 36% to 34% in July, ‚Äúsuggesting the early stages of volatility compression. However, storm clouds are forming as tariff negotiations and renewed concerns about Fed independence loom over markets.‚Äù BTC 30-day volatility over the last month: Source: Derive.xyz, Amberdata There is some 30% chance of BTC reverting to $100,000 before the end of September. Also, the chance of ETH falling to $3,000 in that time is about 35%. On the other hand, there is a 46% chance BTC hits $150,000 and a 12% chance it reaches $200,000 before the end of the year. Moreover, the 30-day volatility gap between ETH and BTC increased from 24% to 30% in July. ‚ÄúETH is expected to remain more volatile, likely reflecting renewed investor interest following its 10 th birthday and the rise of ETH treasury companies such as Ethermachine and Bitmine,‚Äù Forster says. James Toledano, Chief Operating Officer at Unity Wallet , added that in the near term, Bitcoin could continue to trade sideways as markets absorb macroeconomic signals. But ‚Äúa rise in inflation expectations or renewed institutional inflows could provide the momentum needed for another push toward its previous high and possibly even a new all‚Äëtime high.‚Äù He continued: ‚ÄúWhen the Fed holds rates steady, it usually supports Bitcoin by preserving liquidity and maintaining a favorable environment for risk assets. While this doesn‚Äôt guarantee an immediate price surge, it does remove a key bearish catalyst. Given Bitcoin‚Äôs recent run-up, I expect the price reaction to be relatively muted in the short term ‚Äì though I‚Äôd be happy to be proven wrong.‚Äù Also, Charley Cooper, Chief Operating Officer at Ava Labs, said that ‚Äúit‚Äôs no surprise that the Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged. From a macro perspective, they‚Äôre waiting for what they believe is the right opportunity to cut rates. Whenever that comes, it will be bullish for crypto.‚Äù He added that it‚Äôs realistic to assume that ‚Äúlater this year we should get a rate cut or two, which will be great for crypto.‚Äù ‚ÄúCrypto investors in the early days thought they had divorced themselves from the financial system,‚Äù Cooper says. ‚ÄúOver time, we‚Äôve increasingly seen that as crypto becomes more mainstream, it‚Äôs increasingly impacted by some of the same macro factors that other asset classes are.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe policy decisions out of Washington, whether economic, trade, monetary, are having more of a direct impact on crypto, and those of us in the crypto markets have to pay attention to the same things that we probably didn‚Äôt have to pay attention to in the early days.‚Äù Cooper concludes. Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing on Thursday morning, BTC trades at $115,555. It fell sharply from $118,696 and below the $115,000 mark to $114,980. It recovered somewhat since. The coin may still fall further below this level, possibly into the $113,000 zone. Alternatively, should the bull return, it could rise back towards the $118,696. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView Also, Ethereum is currently trading at $3,673. It initially climbed to the price of $3,874, nearing the $4,000 mark. However, it then plunged to $3,653. Like BTC, ETH recovered slightly since the daily low, but can still go lower should the dip continue, possibly to the $3,640 level. Meanwhile, after several days of hovering at the edge of the greed zone, the crypto market sentiment has dropped into the neutral area. The crypto fear and greed index stands at 57 today compared to 62 yesterday. A slight fear has crept into the market, and should the prices and the sentiment drop further, it may open buying opportunities. Furthermore, on Wednesday, the US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded outflows, breaking a streak again. It lost $114.83 million . Of the five funds that saw inflows, BlackRock took in the most: $18.62 million. At the same time, three funds saw outflows, the highest of which is Ark&21Shares‚Äô $89.92 million. At the same time, the US ETH ETFs broke the record with the 20 th consecutive day of positive flows. The inflows stood at $17 million on Thursday. BlackRock took in $18.18 million, and Fidelity saw inflows of $5.62 million. On the other hand, Grayscale was $6.8 million in the red. Crypto exchange Coinbase bought 2,509 BTC in Q2 2025 and said it would increase its Bitcoin holdings.

Quick FAQ Why did crypto move with stocks today? Both the crypto and the stock market fell over the last day. The S&P 500 was down by 0.37%, the Nasdaq-100 increased by 0.55%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 0.74%. This comes as the US Federal Reserve decided to keep the interest rate unchanged, as investors focus on the inflation data and the tech companies‚Äô financial reports. Is this dip sustainable? In the short term, the prices may drop further. For now, the dip doesn‚Äôt seem to be long-lasting, but the future outcome will depend on the incoming economic signals.

2025-08-01T10:54:03,"Ethereum (ETH) Price Decline, Recent Cardano (ADA) Predictions, and More: Bits Recap August 1","TL;DR ETH slumped by 6% amid the broader market correction, but whale accumulation, a nine-year low in exchange balances, and steady ETF inflows hint at a possible rebound in the near term. ADA dropped even more, yet analysts remain bullish, with some predicting a surge beyond $4 if the asset clears key resistance at $0.92. BTC briefly dipped below $114,500, but an RSI near 30 suggests oversold conditions, while optimistic traders eye a breakout to $145K-$150K. ETH Heads South The past several hours have not been pleasant for the cryptocurrency market, which has registered a significant pullback following the latest tariffs implemented by the Trump administration. Ethereum (ETH) is among the losers with its price dropping by 6% on a daily scale to around $3,600 (per CoinGecko‚Äôs data). Historically, August has tended to be a bearish month for the asset, with gains recorded only in 2017, 2020, and 2021. It will be interesting to see if this year proves to be among the exceptions. ETH Monthly Returns, Source: CoinGlass On the other hand, some key factors suggest that this might be only a temporary correction, followed by another rally. Whales have scooped up thousands of ETH in the past days, signaling strong confidence and reducing the amount of coins available on the open market. Additionally, the number of tokens stored on crypto exchanges plummeted to a nine-year low of under 19 million. This means that investors have shifted from centralized platforms toward self-custody methods, which reduces the immediate selling pressure. ETH Exchange Reserve, Source: CryptoQuant The flow of capital into spot ETH ETFs remains solid, while those interested in exploring more bullish factors and optimistic price predictions can refer to our article here . ADA‚Äôs Next Targets? Cardano‚Äôs native token has performed even worse than ETH in the past 24 hours, slipping by 8% to approximately $0.72 (its lowest point since mid-July). Despite the downtrend, many analysts foresee a renewed uptrend knocking on the door. The popular X user, Ali Martinez, believes ADA‚Äôs current price structure resembles that of the last bull cycle, which was later followed by a massive rally. Cardano $ADA is showing the same price structure as the last cycle, only this time, it‚Äôs unfolding more gradually. And it feels like we‚Äôre right at the beginning of an explosive move. pic.twitter.com/xbg3phaz6x ‚Äî Ali (@ali_charts) August 1, 2025 Hardy and Smith are also among the optimists. The former claimed ADA‚Äôs bull run has yet to begin, while the latter argued that the valuation could skyrocket to a new all-time high above $4 once it surpasses the breakout target of $0.92. What About BTC? The primary cryptocurrency briefly dipped under $114,500 before recovering some of the losses. As of this writing, it trades at around $115,000, representing a 3.2% drop on a daily basis . Its negative performance coincides with the broader correction of the cryptocurrency market, as well as the actions of retail investors who appear to have shifted into selling mode. However, many members of the crypto community believe BTC‚Äôs bull run is far from being over. X user CRYPTOWZRD forecasted a pump to $145,000 if it breaks $120,000, whereas Grypto GEMs set a target of $150,000. Bitcoin‚Äôs Relative Strength Index (RSI), which measures the latest speed and magnitude of price changes, supports the bullish thesis. Currently, the ratio is hovering around 30, meaning the asset is oversold and may be due for a resurgence. Conversely, anything above 70 could be interpreted as a precursor of a pullback.

2025-08-01T10:30:24,"Coinbase Bitcoin Premium Just Turned Red For The First Time Since May ‚Äî What This Means","Coinbase‚Äôs Bitcoin premium has dropped into negative territory for the first time since May. This development is bearish for the flagship crypto as it suggests that demand from the U.S. may be waning. Coinbase Bitcoin Premium In The Red CryptoQuant data shows that the Coinbase Bitcoin Premium Index is at -0.00254829, marking the first time it has been in the red since May 29, when it was at -0.01626105. This Index tracks the difference between the Bitcoin price on Coinbase and the Bitcoin price on Binance. It is also used to gauge the spot demand for BTC from institutional and retail investors in the U.S. Related Reading: Finance Author Warns Of Great Depression Style Crash, Is Bitcoin The Answer? As such, this development suggests that the demand for BTC among U.S. investors is currently low. This is significant considering that Bitcoin rallies to new highs have coincided with the Coinbase premium being in positive territory. This highlights how much demand from the U.S. contributes to BTC‚Äôs uptrend. In recent times, this demand has mainly come from the Bitcoin ETFs, with Coinbase acting as a custodian for eight out of the eleven spot BTC funds. Notably, the drop in the Coinbase Bitcoin premium coincides with the drop in the net inflows and increase in outflows from these funds. SoSo Value data shows that these funds recorded net outflows of $114.83 million on July 31. Before now, they had also gone on a 3-day streak of consecutive net outflows between July 21 and 23. This indicates a wave of profit-taking among these investors, especially following the recent Bitcoin rally to a new all-time high (ATH) of $123,000. In an X post, CryptoQuant also confirmed this wave of profit-taking. The platform revealed that Bitcoin just saw its third major profit-taking wave of this bull run. Realized profits spiked to between $6 and $8 billion in late July, similar to March and December 2024 peaks. CryptoQuant added that it was new whales who led the selling above $120,000. New Investor Dominance Is Growing With Market In Stable Condition In a CryptoQuant on-chain analysis, analyst Axel revealed that new investor dominance is growing and that the market is still stable in this late Bitcoin bull cycle phase. He alluded to the demand and supply between new and old investors metric and noted that the peaks of 64% in March 2024 and 72% in December 2024 coincided with local price maximums. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Market Is Over? Analyst Calls 50% Crash To $60,000 The analyst noted that during those periods, the influx of new liquidity into Bitcoin was exhausted, and old holders began actively taking profits. However, this time is different, as the current value of the demand and supply between new and old investors is 30%, which is only half of the overheated levels. Axel added that the trend is directed upward as the cumulative activity of young coins has been steadily growing since July 2024. The analyst remarked that this indicates that a notable layer of new buyers is entering the Bitcoin market. Meanwhile, pressure from the old holders is not yet critical.

2025-08-01T10:30:00,"BTC Revaluation Masks A Tough Q2 For Riot Platforms","Summary Riot Platforms remains highly dependent on Bitcoin mining, with 92% of Q2-25 revenue from BTC despite efforts to diversify. Profitability is weak: positive net income was solely due to BTC revaluation; core operations are unprofitable even with high BTC prices. The company shifted from HODLing to selling most mined BTC in Q2, signaling possible industry stress and the need to fund data center expansion. I maintain a 'hold' rating on RIOT, as mining economics remain challenging and upside is capped unless the BTC price surges further. A little over 5 months ago, I covered Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) for Seeking Alpha and declared the stock a viable trading ticker, but probably not something investors should hold for a long period of time. In the time since that piece, RIOT has actually performed reasonably well‚Äîbeating both the broader market and the CoinShares Bitcoin Mining ETF ( WGMI ) over the last five and a half months: Data by YCharts While holding RIOT stock has not been as lucrative as simply owning Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) either directly on-chain or through the ETF wrapper, RIOT has beaten the market since mid-February. In this update, we'll look at key takeaways from the company's Q2-25 earnings report, the pivot from HODL-ing to selling production over the last three months, and whether Bitcoin mining profitability has improved with six-figure BTC prices. Q2-24 Earnings For the quarter ended June 2025, Riot Platforms reported $153 million in top-line revenue. While this was a 5% sequential decline from $161.4 in Q1, revenue was up 118% year-over-year from the same period in 2024. Revenue (000s) Q2-25 Q2-24 YoY Bitcoin Mining $140,889 $55,764 152.7% Engineering $10,576 $9,627 9.9% Other $1,523 $4,627 -67.1% Total $152,988 $70,018 118.5% BTC % of Total 92.1% 79.6% 15.6% Source: Riot Platforms, 10-Q Though Riot announced HPC data center intentions earlier this year and has subsequently hired a 'Chief Data Center Officer' to further those efforts, the company was even more reliant on Bitcoin mining for top line revenue in Q2-25 than it was in Q2-24; at $140.9 million in revenue from Bitcoin mining, Riot garnered over 92% of the company's revenue in the quarter from BTC. This was a 15.6% year-over-year increase from just under 80% BTC reliance in Q2-24. Engineering revenue came in at $10.6 million - up just shy of 10% year over year. 'Other' was down. The point is, the company still generally goes as Bitcoin goes, and the mining space continues to be an incredibly challenging business: Q2 COGS, 000s (Riot Platforms, 10-Q) RIOT did indeed report positive net income of $219.5 million in the quarter, but this was entirely dependent on a $470.8 million revaluation of Riot's enormous BTC treasure trove. Meaning, without increases in the value of the Bitcoin that Riot Platforms had already mined in prior quarters, the company's true net income would have almost certainly been negative in Q2, even with BTC in six-figure territory. Even if we were to take away a $158.1 million loss on a contract settlement and a $42.7 million change in value of derivative assets, RIOT would have still been negative in the quarter by over $50 million. It took $250.1 million in combined COGS, SG&A, and depreciation/amortization to generate $153 million in revenue. Bitcoin Treasury Shift What I do find to be quite interesting over the last three months is the fact that Riot shifted from HODLing all production for 13 straight months between February 2024 and March 2025. The company pivoted to selling most of its monthly production in April and continued that behavior through June: Monthly Revenue (Riot, Author's Chart) Over the last three months, Riot has realized $131.8 million in BTC sales. Prior to HODLing all production beginning in February of last year, Riot had been selling some of its monthly mining rewards through the entirety of 2023. To get a sense of how substantial this Bitcoin revenue has been for Riot between April and June, it took all of January through October 2023 for the company to reach the realized BTC sales revenue level it reached in Q2 nominally. Measured in BTC, it took 5,055 BTC to generate $131.5 million in realized revenue between January and October 2023. The company generated $131.8 million in realized sales from selling just 1,372 BTC last quarter. Despite the massive jump in average sales price from $26k to $96k per BTC in our sample above, it still wasn't enough to generate positive adjusted net income, taking away asset revaluation. The Mining Business is Still Brutal The true economics of mining continue to be quite poor when depreciation/amortization are included as all-in costs. Hash price remains near the new floor post-halving: USD/PHS/Day (HashRateIndex) This chart is the reason why Bitcoin miners haven't had the same parabolic pop that they had during the 2021 bull run. The daily revenue expected from mining per PHS is less than $60, and that has generally been the case since the block reward halving in April 2024. The fact that the BTC price has gone as high as $120k per coin hasn't alleviated margin pressure to the degree mining stock investors likely would have hoped. Global exahash continues its relentless rise: Data by YCharts More importantly, the hash rate is growing in line with Bitcoin's price. Thus, the explosive mining stock price rallies that we saw during the 2021 bull cycle - which generated immense profitability numbers due to global exahash not growing as quickly‚Äîhave not manifested this time around. Closing Remarks During the last cycle, miners selling down their BTC stacks was an early warning that trouble was coming for the broader industry. While RIOT isn't tapping the company's BTC treasury stack yet, the fact that the company has shifted to selling nearly all monthly production for an entire quarter might be a signal worth considering. To be sure, data center Capex will need funding, and Riot's options are some combination of dilution, debt, and/or monetizing BTC. The latter of which might actually be the most prudent way to fund data center growth. It's also interesting that Riot Platforms has begun reducing its holdings of Bitfarms ( BITF ) stock in recent weeks. Many will likely remember the failed takeover attempt of Bitfarms by Riot last year. That Riot is now reducing its Bitfarms position is not exactly a ringing endorsement for the current state of the BTC mining industry from where I sit. All this said, I'll reiterate my 'hold' for RIOT. If the price of BTC continues to rise, RIOT should benefit due to how much coin the company holds. However, I'm becoming increasingly convinced that we're close to BTC's high for the year if we haven't seen it already.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4807433-btc-revaluation-masks-a-tough-q2-for-riot-platforms?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|TRADING|MARKET","BTC-USD|RIOT",cryptocompare

2025-08-01T10:25:05,"Solana (SOL) and Sui (SUI) Find Strong Support: Are These Prime Buy Zones?","While it might still be too early to tell, Bitcoin (BTC) could be getting ready for a bounce after finding support at the bottom of its bull flag. Strong altcoins $SOL and $SUI are excellent candidates for their own bounces. Are they in prime buy zones? $SOL hits horizontal support together with 0.5 Fibonacci level Source: TradingView The 4-hour chart for $SOL does look very good. The price is currently resting on the strong horizontal support at $168, while a small wick down to test the 0.5 Fibonacci level has successfully taken place. Looking at the Fibonacci extension levels it can be seen just how accurately the price is respecting them. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI has its indicators at the bottom, ready to rise and bring upside momentum into the price. At the same time, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) reveals that the indicator has just dipped into oversold territory. If one looks left on the chart, the last big rally out of oversold territory can be observed. Is another one of these inbound? Positive price action badly needed for $SOL going into this weekend Source: TradingView The weekly time frame does hold some concerns for the $SOL price going forward. In the price action, the current weekly candle has dipped below the ascending trendline (although it is still holding support), and it is enveloping the previous candle. In the Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart it can be seen that the indicators are posturing to cross back down. What will be needed in order to cancel out these negatives is some good, positive price action going into the weekend. With all the short-term Stochastic RSI indicators at the bottom and ready to rise, this could still be a decent prospect. $SUI ripe for a bounce Source: TradingView Like $SOL, the $SUI price is currently resting on top of strong horizontal support. With the shorter term Stochastic RSI indicators all bottomed, it would appear that $SUI could be ripe for a bounce. One concern on this time frame is that the price has fallen through the ascending trendline. That said, if the expected bounce does arrive, this should be surmounted without too much problem. The resistances at $3.75 and $4 are likely to cause a lot more difficulty. Be aware that there could also be a quick candle wick to $3.40 if the market does come back down again. $SUI bulls have much to do Source: TradingView Again, much like the case for $SOL, the Stochastic RSI indicators on the weekly time frame are threatening to cross down. Furthermore, the current weekly candle is also very much enveloping the previous one. Both of these bearish factors will need to be cancelled out over the next couple of days or so as we enter the weekend. Therefore, it might be said that a really strong bounce is required. If such a bounce does occur, and this weekly candle can close above $4, the next week of price action could be very favourable. However, if this doesn‚Äôt come to pass, nerves might continue to shred. Let us see what the end of the week brings. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-08-01T10:06:10,"ETH Price Falls, But Ethereum ETFs Keep Breaking Records","Ethereum spot ETFs have recorded net positive flows for 20 consecutive trading days. This accumulation streak, highlighted by a $17 million net intake on July 31, stands in stark contrast to Bitcoin ETFs, which saw a $115 million exit on the same day, their first outflow after five days of gains. Institutional Appetite The latest run of 20 days surpassed an earlier one of 19 green days between May 16 and June 12, cut short by $2.18 million in outflows on June 13. This was followed by a few days of intermittent flows before the current spree kicked off in earnest on July 3. It has since pushed cumulative allocations to $9.64 billion, per SoSoValue data, with July alone seeing $5.41 billion in net capital directed toward ETH ETFs, more than the combined total of the previous 11 months. BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA remains the market leader, attracting $18.18 million on July 31 and now holding $11.37 billion in assets, representing 2.52% of ETH‚Äôs market cap. Meanwhile, Grayscale‚Äôs ETHE reported $6.8 million in withdrawals, though its $4.22 billion asset base shows its continued relevance. Fidelity‚Äôs FETH recorded a $5.62 million boost, bringing its net assets to $2.55 billion. The momentum is striking when viewed against historical trends. The last recorded outflow was on July 8, after which funds posted some of their largest single-day gains, including $726.7 million on July 16, $602 million on July 17, and $533.8 million on July 22. These inflows helped Ethereum ETF assets climb to $21.52 billion, roughly 4.77% of the cryptocurrency‚Äôs market cap. Ethereum Price Action Despite the ETF-fueled demand, ETH slipped 2.4% in the last 24 hours to around $3,786, following a brief rally to $3,933 earlier this week. However, the token is up 53% in the past 30 days, outpacing Bitcoin‚Äôs rangebound movement between $116,000 and $119,000. Industry analysts see these ETF flows as structurally bullish. Recently, QCP Capital cautioned that overheated funding rates could introduce near-term resistance around $4,000, but it stressed that continued institutional demand, paired with corporate treasuries like SharpLink Gaming and BitMine accumulating billions in ETH, may underpin further upside. Meanwhile, on July 31, the total value traded across ETH ETFs stood at $1.28 billion. If this pace holds, it could help ETH challenge its November 2021 all-time high of $4,878 sooner than expected, potentially cementing its role as the frontrunner in an altcoin-led cycle.

2025-08-01T10:05:30,"Legendary Trader and XRP Proponent: This Is Not a Natural Dip. It Looks Forced","Veteran crypto analyst and long-standing market participant, Crypto Bitlord, has reacted strongly to XRP‚Äôs sudden price decline on August 1, 2025. In a recent post on X, Bitlord described the downturn as anything but natural. According to his statement, ‚ÄúThis is not a natural dip. It looks ‚Äòforced.‚Äô‚Äù He did not attribute the decline to typical supply and demand dynamics or fundamental changes in Ripple‚Äôs operations. Instead, he suggested that the downward pressure on XRP may have been orchestrated, implying that the motive could be manipulation. In the same thread, Bitlord reaffirmed his long-term stance on crypto investing, particularly with XRP. He stated , ‚ÄúForce it lower. That‚Äôs ok. We can buy more there too. In reality, we‚Äôre never selling. Crypto is our life, this is the end game.‚Äù Force it lower. That‚Äôs ok. We can buy more there too. In reality we‚Äôre never selling. Crypto is our life, this is the end game ‚Äî Crypto Bitlord (@crypto_bitlord7) July 31, 2025 His comments reflect unwavering conviction, despite current market volatility, and he framed the downturn as a buying opportunity rather than a cause for concern. Market Mechanics and External Factors In response to Bitlord‚Äôs post, an X user identified as Unique_Sps offered additional context regarding macroeconomic conditions and derivatives activity that may have contributed to XRP‚Äôs sharp drop. According to Unique_Sps, one significant factor is the expiry of Bitcoin and Ethereum options contracts on August 1, with a notional value exceeding $7.2 billion. Large-scale expirations such as these often result in heightened volatility as market makers rebalance their books, close positions, or hedge against directional movements. This can temporarily distort pricing across multiple assets, including XRP. Another external factor cited by Unique_Sps was the announcement of new tariffs on Canadian goods by President Donald Trump‚Äôs administration. The 35% increase in tariffs has introduced fresh uncertainty into the global economic environment. Investors may have reacted swiftly to this development, anticipating the potential for retaliatory trade measures by Canada and the risk of escalating tensions into a broader trade conflict. According to the user, this combination of uncertainty and high-leverage expiry triggered broad-based sell-offs across multiple assets, including XRP. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 High Leverage and Liquidation Risk Data from several crypto analytics platforms confirm that a large number of long positions were liquidated during the same trading window. These liquidations coincided with a general sell-off in both Bitcoin and Ethereum , which recorded losses between 2% to 4%. XRP experienced a sharper decline, falling below the $3.00 level. Analysts have noted that XRP tends to exhibit higher beta behavior in market corrections, often amplifying both gains and losses relative to major assets, such as Bitcoin (BTC). Although the specifics of the alleged manipulation mentioned by Bitlord remain unconfirmed, the presence of leverage-driven liquidations and macroeconomic catalysts does offer a potential framework for understanding the scale of XRP‚Äôs drop. Market observers also noted a surge in trading volume during the dip, a common occurrence during episodes of heightened volatility. Outlook and Sentiment Despite the sharp pullback, Bitlord‚Äôs message conveyed continued confidence in the long-term utility and value of XRP and the broader crypto market. His assertion that ‚Äúwe‚Äôre never selling‚Äù reiterates a long-held view among segments of the crypto investor community who remain unfazed by short-term fluctuations. As the broader crypto market absorbs the impact of derivatives expiry and geopolitical headlines, XRP investors are closely watching for a rebound or further downside. Market support at the $2.90 to $3.00 range has so far held, though sentiment remains cautious as uncertainty persists.

Numerous international media platforms have evaluated WonderChain as ‚Äúone of the fastest-spreading projects in Web3 history,‚Äù forming a sharp contrast with how long it took Bitcoin to gain attention from mainstream media. Acknowledged by Global Media as a Web3.5 Pioneer WonderChain‚Äôs Web3.5 vision is already drawing intense global media attention. CoinStats described WonderChain as ‚Äúa project with unparalleled marketing organization in blockchain history, advancing toward global dominance,‚Äù further reporting, ‚ÄúWonderChain is more than just a trustworthy brand‚Äîit‚Äôs a movement shaping how Web3 is recognized and experienced globally.‚Äù Additionally, seven of the most influential Greater Chinese media outlets selected WonderChain as one of the top 3 blockchain projects to watch in 2025, alongside Bitcoin and Celestia, further validating its influence. ‚Äª Key Global Media Evaluations: TechBullion: ‚ÄúClosely watched by VCs, one of the most anticipated crypto projects among global investors.‚Äù Digital Journal & IBTimes: ‚ÄúTop 3 blockchain projects to watch in 2025, alongside Bitcoin and Celestia.‚Äù CoinStats: ‚ÄúOne of the most attractive Web3 projects globally in 2025.‚Äù DailyCrunch: ‚ÄúA prime example of the Community-First Revolution.‚Äù CoinMarketCap, Binance Square: Featured WonderChain in simultaneous coverage, confirming its global reach. The Core of Web3.5 as Defined by WonderChain WonderChain defines Web3.5 not as a mere version upgrade, but as a fundamental redesign of the internet ecosystem. Its three core pillars are: 1) DAO-Based Flexible Decentralized Governance Transitioning from corporate-led operations to user-led decision-making structures. 2) User-Led Reward Mechanism Moving beyond simple token distributions to a refined incentive system based on genuine contribution and participation. 3) Real-Life Integrated Web3 Services On-chain activities are directly linked to real-life rewards such as travel, spending, and community engagement. This structure enables users to become co-architects of the ecosystem, rather than mere participants. A Message to Apple and Google While Apple and Google engineered the centralized Web2 experience, they still adhere to a top-down structure. In contrast, WonderChain proposes a fundamental alternative through its user-driven Web3.5 ecosystem. The shift in technology paradigms has already begun, and it is irreversible. WonderChain is advancing the realization of this Web3.5 structure, centered on DAO governance, with over 60,000 users voluntarily participating in its community. Web3.5: A Paradigm Shift in Motion The Web3.5 model proposed by WonderChain goes beyond a technological leap; it enables a circular system of ‚Äúactivity ‚Üí reward ‚Üí consumption‚Äù where users become both consumers and co-owners/decision-makers. Whereas Web2.0 was characterized by centralized platforms, and existing Web3.0 only partially utilized blockchain technology, WonderChain‚Äôs Web3.5 combines DAO-based community governance with real-life applicable services‚Äîa truly integrated environment where technology, usability, and governance converge. August 2025: The Launchpad for the Web3.5 Ecosystem In August 2025, WonderChain plans to officially initiate the first phase of its Web3.5 ecosystem with its token launch. This event goes beyond the mere issuance of a crypto asset‚Äîit marks the starting point for realizing the core structures of Web3.5: DAO governance, user reward mechanisms, and real-world integrated functionalities. Following coverage from BitcoinWorld, discussions within the community have intensified around potential listings on major global exchanges such as Binance , OKX, and Bybit‚Äîa signal of WonderChain‚Äôs expanding global presence. Conclusion: The Pioneer of the Web3.5 Era ‚ÄúIf Bitcoin is digital gold, WonderChain is digital life.‚Äù WonderChain‚Äôs vision of Web3.5 signifies a shift not only in technology but also in how networks operate and how value is distributed. If Apple and Google designed the network structure of Web2.0, WonderChain is now leading the design of the Web3.5 era. The consistent recognition by global media supports this claim. WonderChain is no longer just a ‚Äútrusted brand,‚Äù but a true force reconstructing how Web3 is understood and experienced. It is no longer a question of if WonderChain will succeed, but when. The one who will go beyond the internet order designed by Apple and Google to redefine the very paradigm of the digital era is none other than WonderChain.

2025-08-01T10:00:32,"Dogecoin Could See Bullish Continuation If It Reclaims This Level","The Dogecoin price has dropped over the last few days as market headwinds move from bullish to bearish once again . This comes as there has been a decline in market participation, leading to a drop in trading volume as well. As such, the meme coin has now been pushed back toward a major support level, with resistance already mounting overhead. Dogecoin Must Beat $0.239-$0.241 Amid the declining Dogecoin price, crypto analyst Mentor Michael has outlined the levels that the meme coin must beat in order to resume its bullish trajectory. After falling below the $0.22 level, it has now formed major resistance above, and what happens when the price retests this resistance will determine the next direction. The first of these lies at the $0.239-$0.241 union resistance. This is the first resistance level that has formed following the Dogecoin price crash. Therefore, if DOGE is able to successfully retest and reclaim this level, it could turn it back into support and serve as the launchpad for the next price increase. According to the crypto analyst, a break above this resistance would mean that the meme coin could move toward the mid-channel resistance. Given the recent price performance, this puts it at around $0.260-$0.280, leading to the very next step in the breakout cycle . A sustained upward momentum would then push for the next major resistance, which was not broken in the most recent rally. $0.3 is now a target for a break to confirm a continuation or for a rejection that would invalidate the bullishness. Failure To Reclaim Could Lead To Bearishness In the event that the Dogecoin price fails to retest and break resistance, then it is more likely to see a bearish trend from here. This first push would be to retest the support at $0.215-$0.218, where the bears must make their stand or risk losing control entirely. This failure would set it on another path that could see it struggle and possibly move below $0.2 again before the bulls are able to reclaim control . At this time, the crypto analyst advises investors to look for signs such as ‚Äúrising volume, break and close above resistance zones, and bullish indicator alignment‚Äù to serve as confirmation for an upward move . Otherwise, it is likely that the decline will continue.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-bullish-continuation/,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK|AIRDROP|XLM|LTC|CFX|FLOKI|MX|COMMODITY|ONDO|ENA|GALA|BTG|MATIC|LINK","Dogecoin|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt",cryptocompare
