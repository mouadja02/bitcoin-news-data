2025-08-01T17:54:08,"Analytics Firm Issues Serious Warning: ‚ÄúBitcoin Below This Level Is Like Thin Ice, So Be Very Careful‚Äù","Cryptocurrency analysis firm CryptoQuant has published a striking analysis following the Bitcoin price drop from $118,000 to $115,000. According to the analysis, the price of Bitcoin suddenly jumped from $112,000 to $115,800 on July 10, 2025. However, it was claimed that this rise lacked robust technical and on-chain data. CryptoQuant analysts note that no support levels have emerged due to the price's rapid rise between these levels. According to onchain data, there is no significant trading volume or strong demand signals in the $112,000 to $115,800 range. Technically, there is no solid ground to hold the price at this time, as there has been no prior consolidation or resistance in this region.

According to the analysis, Bitcoin is currently sitting at its last known support level, supported by on-chain data, ‚Äúlike a shelf with nothing underneath.‚Äù If this last support level is broken, the price is expected to move downward at the same rate. As long as the support level holds, there is no problem, but investors are advised to exercise caution, set stop-loss orders, and closely monitor price movements.

2025-08-01T17:19:54,"Crypto slowdown drags Coinbase down","Coinbase shares crashed 15% on Friday after the company disappointed investors with weak second-quarter numbers. The crypto exchange posted a sharp drop in adjusted profit, pushing its stock to $321.68, the lowest it‚Äôs been in over a month. The selloff, which wiped out $14.3 billion in value, came after Coinbase reported just $33.2 million in adjusted income, way down from the $294.4 million it brought in during the same quarter last year. The results landed badly across Wall Street, where expectations had already been high after Coinbase joined the S&P 500 in May and ran up 52% year-to-date going into the earnings. According to Reuters, analyst Michael Miller from Morningstar called the shares ‚Äúsignificantly overvalued,‚Äù adding, ‚ÄúWe believe that the market is projecting too much future growth for the firm.‚Äù H.C. Wainwright analysts echoed that, saying, ‚ÄúWe believe investor enthusiasm had reached a ‚Äòfever pitch‚Äô heading into last night‚Äôs results, as valuation has detached from underlying fundamentals.‚Äù Crypto slowdown drags Coinbase down The weak results were tied directly to slower trading. Coinbase struggled with low trading volumes throughout the quarter as the recent bullish sentiment in crypto markets made traders hold onto assets instead of selling. Less trading meant less revenue for the exchange, and that hit profits hard. The volatility that Coinbase normally benefits from just wasn‚Äôt there during the period. Meanwhile, Robinhood reported that its crypto trading revenue nearly doubled during the same quarter. Robinhood has a much smaller presence in the crypto market than Coinbase, but it managed to pull ahead due to a spike in trading activity. That contrast only deepened the pressure on Coinbase to explain the drop. Some analysts think the slowdown may be temporary. Coinbase‚Äôs revenue estimates for July pointed to stronger activity, likely boosted by the Genius Act, which became law that same month. The legislation fueled a new wave of crypto optimism, sending bitcoin to an all-time high and possibly reigniting the kind of trading activity Coinbase needs to recover. But none of that helped the company on Friday, when investors responded directly to the second-quarter collapse. The earnings miss also hit other crypto-related stocks. Circle fell 4%, Galaxy Digital dropped 2%, and Bitmine Immersion, which holds ether reserves, tumbled 8%. MicroStrategy, which holds a large bitcoin treasury, lost 5%. Coinbase was the worst hit among them all. Amazon slips after earnings call disappoints Wall Street Amazon also took a beating. The company released its second-quarter earnings on Thursday and beat expectations in most categories, but it wasn‚Äôt enough. The stock dropped during the conference call and closed 7% lower on Friday. For the year, it‚Äôs now down around 1%, a rare position for a company that usually stays on the green side of the chart. The market‚Äôs reaction made it clear that beating estimates alone wasn‚Äôt enough anymore, not without stronger signals on growth, margins, or strategy going forward. At the same time, crypto markets were hit by a broader pullback after President Donald Trump introduced a revised version of his ‚Äúreciprocal‚Äù tariffs targeting multiple countries. Bitcoin managed to stay roughly flat, but other top tokens didn‚Äôt. Ether, XRP, and Binance Coin all lost 2%. Overnight, bitcoin touched $114,110.73, triggering long liquidations across the board. That means traders using leverage were forced to sell when the price dropped. Bitcoin saw $172 million worth of these forced sales in 24 hours. Ether lost even more, with $210 million in liquidations on centralized exchanges. Even after a strong July, where bitcoin rose 8% and ether soared 49%, the mood has changed. Uncertainty is back. Lower trading volumes and higher volatility in August are making investors nervous. That has everyone watching whether the momentum will last. ETF flows also showed cracks. Ether ETFs pulled in over $5 billion in July. There was only one outflow day‚ÄîJuly 2, when $1.8 million came out. That pushed cumulative inflows for ether ETFs to $9.64 billion. But bitcoin ETFs saw the reverse. $114 million left bitcoin ETFs on the last day of July, dropping the monthly net inflow to $6 billion. That‚Äôs out of a total of $55 billion that‚Äôs gone into bitcoin ETFs overall so far. Get seen where it counts.

2025-08-01T17:15:47,"El Salvador Bitcoin-Friendly Nayib Bukele To Stay In Power Indefinitely","El Salvador‚Äôs ruling party has made a major political shift. El Salvador‚Äôs ruling party has approved a big change to the constitution. This new rule could allow President Nayib Bukele to stay in office for as many terms as he wants, provided he continues to get elected. The decision was made quickly and is already causing strong reactions both in El Salvador and around the world. This is especially given Bukele‚Äôs close ties to the country‚Äôs bold Bitcoin (BTC) strategy. El Salvador Opens the Door to Indefinite Presidencies On Thursday, lawmakers from Bukele‚Äôs New Ideas party passed five major constitutional changes with a 57-3 vote. The new rules allow a president to run for office as many times as they want. The ruling political leaders also changed the presidential term from 5 years to 6 and removed the need for a second round of voting. These changes were passed quickly, with little public discussion. Some people are worried that this hurts democracy and transparency. Ana Figueroa, a lawmaker who proposed the bill, defended the reforms as a way to give voters more direct power over who governs them. She argued that citizens should decide how long a president or elected official stays in office. President Bukele Builds a Bitcoin Legacy President Bukele began his second term on June 1, 2024. During his time in office, he has gained international attention for adopting Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021. Since then, El Salvador has continued to purchase more of the top cryptocurrency and now owns approximately 6,246 BTC, despite pressure from global financial groups. People who support the new law think Bukele‚Äôs leadership could help grow the country‚Äôs economy, especially through digital and crypto projects. They argue that his unique approach has brought international attention and innovation to the government. Recently, Bolivia‚Äôs Central Bank (BCB) partnered with El Salvador‚Äôs National Commission of Digital Assets (CNAD). They planned to work together to improve rules for digital assets and develop blockchain technology. Although Bukele has not confirmed whether he will run again, this legal pathway still gives him, or any future president, the option to remain in power indefinitely, as long as they are elected. Critics Say Democracy Is in Danger in El Salvador Not everyone agrees with the changes. Some people believe the new rules weaken democracy and give too much power to one person. Marcela Villatoro, a lawmaker from the opposition Republican National Alliance (ARENA), strongly criticized the decision. He called it a blow to the country‚Äôs democratic foundations. Human rights groups also raised an alarm. Noah Bullock, executive director of Cristosal, condemned the process used to pass the reforms. He noted that it was done quickly, without public awareness or meaningful debate. He warned that El Salvador is starting to look like countries with dictators, where leaders change the laws to stay in power, and there are no firm limits to stop them.

2025-08-01T17:10:10,"SEC Crypto Breakthrough: Empowering Early-Stage Projects Through Crucial Dialogue","BitcoinWorld SEC Crypto Breakthrough: Empowering Early-Stage Projects Through Crucial Dialogue In a pivotal development poised to redefine the relationship between regulators and innovators, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is taking a proactive step towards fostering understanding within the digital asset space. The specialized unit known as the SEC Crypto Task Force has announced an unprecedented series of national roundtables, aiming to engage directly with the burgeoning blockchain community. This initiative represents a significant shift, moving beyond traditional Washington-centric discussions to embrace a more inclusive dialogue with the very projects shaping the future of finance. For early-stage crypto ventures, this presents a unique opportunity to voice their perspectives, share their innovations, and directly influence the regulatory frameworks that will govern their operations. It‚Äôs a chance to move from speculation about rules to direct participation in their formation, potentially paving the way for clearer, more effective, and innovation-friendly regulation. What Exactly is the SEC Crypto Task Force Planning with These Roundtables? The SEC Crypto Task Force, under the leadership of Commissioner Hester Peirce, is embarking on a mission to gather firsthand insights from the grassroots of the crypto ecosystem. This isn‚Äôt just another formal hearing; it‚Äôs designed as a series of direct, interactive engagements across various U.S. cities. The core objective is to broaden the scope of input into regulatory policymaking, ensuring that the SEC‚Äôs understanding of digital assets is comprehensive and reflective of real-world development. Specifically, the invitation extends to early-stage crypto projects ‚Äì those that have been operational for less than two years and employ fewer than 10 individuals. This targeted approach ensures that the voices of nascent projects, often the most innovative and disruptive, are heard directly by the regulators. The process for participation is straightforward: interested projects can apply via email, and a list of selected participants will be publicly published, ensuring transparency and accountability in the selection process. This commitment to openness is a crucial element in building trust between the regulator and the regulated. The initiative acknowledges the rapid evolution of blockchain technology and its diverse applications. By directly engaging with developers and founders, the SEC aims to better understand the nuances of various crypto projects, from DeFi protocols to NFT platforms and beyond. This direct line of communication is vital for crafting regulations that are both effective in protecting investors and conducive to technological progress. Why Are These SEC Crypto Roundtables a Game Changer for Innovation? The announcement of these national roundtables by the SEC Crypto Task Force is more than just a procedural update; it‚Äôs a potential turning point for the crypto industry. For years, the sector has grappled with regulatory uncertainty, often operating in a gray area that stifles growth and innovation. These roundtables offer a tangible pathway to address some of these long-standing challenges. Here are some key benefits and reasons why these discussions are considered a game changer: Direct Dialogue: Instead of relying solely on written submissions or lobbying efforts, project founders will have the opportunity to directly explain their technologies, business models, and challenges to SEC officials. This direct interaction can bridge significant knowledge gaps. Informed Policymaking: By gaining a deeper understanding of the technical complexities and operational realities of crypto projects, the SEC can develop more nuanced, informed, and effective regulatory frameworks that avoid unintended consequences. Reduced Regulatory Uncertainty: While not immediate, these discussions can lay the groundwork for clearer guidelines, helping projects understand their compliance obligations from an earlier stage. This clarity is crucial for attracting investment and fostering sustainable growth. Fostering Innovation: A regulatory environment that is responsive and understands technological advancements is more likely to encourage, rather than hinder, innovation. These roundtables signal a willingness from the SEC to engage with novel concepts. Building Trust: The transparent and inclusive nature of these roundtables can help rebuild trust between the crypto community and regulators, fostering a collaborative environment rather than an adversarial one. To illustrate the potential shift, consider the traditional approach versus this new engagement model: Aspect Traditional Regulatory Engagement SEC Crypto Roundtable Approach Engagement Style Formal submissions, D.C. lobbying, broad hearings Direct, interactive, localized dialogue Target Audience Established firms, legal counsel, industry associations Early-stage projects, founders, developers Input Diversity Often limited to well-resourced entities Broadened, nationwide, grassroots perspectives Outcome Potential Broad rules, reactive enforcement Nuanced, proactive, innovation-aware policy Navigating the Future: What Challenges Might These SEC Crypto Discussions Face? While the prospects are exciting, it‚Äôs important to approach these SEC Crypto roundtables with a realistic understanding of potential challenges. The path to effective crypto regulation is complex, and these discussions are but one step in a long journey. The challenges include: Balancing Innovation and Protection: The SEC‚Äôs dual mandate is to foster capital formation while protecting investors. Striking the right balance, especially in a rapidly evolving sector like crypto, remains a significant hurdle. Ensuring True Representation: While the initiative aims for broader input, ensuring that the selected participants truly represent the diverse and often niche segments of the crypto industry will be crucial. Managing Expectations: These roundtables are about gathering input, not making immediate policy changes. Projects must understand that while their voices are heard, regulatory evolution is a deliberate process. Addressing Global Nature of Crypto: While the SEC is a U.S. regulator, crypto is inherently global. U.S. policy will need to consider international developments and competitive landscapes. For early-stage projects considering participation, here are some actionable insights: Prepare Thoroughly: Understand your project‚Äôs regulatory implications. Be ready to articulate your technology, use case, and how it aligns (or diverges) from existing securities laws. Be Transparent: Openness about your project‚Äôs structure, tokenomics, and operational model will foster trust with regulators. Focus on Solutions: Instead of just highlighting problems, propose constructive solutions or frameworks that could benefit both innovation and investor protection. Emphasize User Protection: Demonstrate how your project prioritizes security, transparency, and fairness for its users, aligning with the SEC‚Äôs core mission. The success of these roundtables hinges on genuine, open dialogue from both sides. For the SEC Crypto Task Force, it‚Äôs about listening and learning. For the crypto projects, it‚Äôs about educating and advocating responsibly. The SEC Crypto Task Force‚Äôs national roundtables aim to bridge the gap between regulators and innovators, fostering a collaborative environment for future policy development. The commitment of Commissioner Hester Peirce, often dubbed ‚ÄòCrypto Mom‚Äô for her supportive stance on innovation, further reinforces the potential for these roundtables to be truly impactful. Her advocacy for clear, innovation-friendly regulation provides a strong foundation for these discussions, offering a glimmer of hope for a more predictable and conducive regulatory environment for digital assets. A New Dawn for SEC Crypto Regulation? The SEC Crypto Task Force‚Äôs national roundtables represent a bold and necessary step towards a more mature and collaborative regulatory landscape for digital assets. By directly engaging with early-stage projects, the SEC is not just gathering information; it‚Äôs building bridges, fostering understanding, and laying the groundwork for regulations that are both robust and responsive to technological progress. This initiative could mark a crucial turning point, moving the industry from a state of perpetual uncertainty to one of guided growth and responsible innovation. The future of SEC Crypto regulation looks promising, as dialogue replaces speculation, and collaboration paves the way for clarity.

He reiterated that the move was part of a broader plan under President Donald Trump to make the country a global crypto leader. ‚ÄúUnder POTUS, we are exploring new possibilities in decentralized computing and digital payments to unlock the potential of blockchain technology,‚Äù Scott posted. The U.S. has entered the Golden Age of Crypto. Under @POTUS , we are exploring new possibilities in decentralized computing and digital payments to unlock the potential of blockchain technology. So start your companies here. Launch your protocols here. And hire your workers‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/oKe1eaXRNO ‚Äî Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent (@SecScottBessent) August 1, 2025 This announcement came just a day after Paul Atkins, the current SEC Chair, launched a new initiative called Project Crypto. The program is meant to help the agency come up with policy ideas and assist the Trump administration in building a legal system for crypto. Scott also used his post to tell crypto entrepreneurs to ‚Äústart companies, launch protocols, and hire workers in the United States.‚Äù Scott attacks Biden-era policies and defends Trump‚Äôs crypto push In an op-ed published Thursday in the Washington Post , Scott said innovation ‚Äúrequires balanced, forward-looking regulation.‚Äù He claimed that Trump‚Äôs actions since returning to office have helped rebuild trust in the crypto industry, which he said was ‚Äúsuffocated‚Äù under the Biden administration. Scott accused President Joe Biden of using regulators to block banks from touching crypto. He also said the former White House tried to ‚Äúlimit or eliminate‚Äù Bitcoin mining entirely and allowed former SEC Chair Gary Gensler to target crypto startups with aggressive legal threats. But since Trump returned, Scott said the message has been different. ‚ÄúWe stood at an inflection point in November, and Trump‚Äôs victory was a clear message to the world that Americans rejected managed decline and the suppression of innovation,‚Äù he wrote. Scott said that, during his first week in office, Trump told agencies to remove the anti-crypto guidance written by the Biden administration. He also directed them to stop enforcement actions that punished companies just for being in the crypto space. Scott pointed to the new law signed by Trump‚Äîthe Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act, also called the GENIUS Act‚Äîas the framework for stablecoin regulation. The law gives dollar-backed stablecoins an official status in the U.S. economy. Scott argued this would turn the U.S. dollar into a digital payment tool that‚Äôs ‚Äúfast, frictionless, and cost-efficient.‚Äù He claimed this would attract global users to the dollar, boost demand for U.S. Treasury bills, reduce borrowing costs, and help keep the dollar as the world‚Äôs top currency. He also brought up the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025, which recently passed the House of Representatives. The bill would define which agency‚Äîeither the SEC or CFTC‚Äîregulates specific crypto activities. It uses models from traditional finance to assign responsibilities and would help end years of uncertainty. Scott warned that if the Senate doesn‚Äôt act on the bill, the president‚Äôs larger plans can‚Äôt be completed. He said the industry needs a proper legal structure to grow inside the country. The former Wall Street star said: ‚ÄúNovember 4, 2024, was America‚Äôs Hard Fork on digital assets. Since taking office, President Trump has righted the wrongs of his predecessor by fashioning the United States into a crypto superpower.‚Äù As part of this effort, Trump picked David Sacks‚Äîa longtime tech founder‚Äîas the new AI and Crypto Czar. He also removed top regulators who had blocked crypto innovation and replaced them with people who support the space. Scott confirmed that several high-profile cases brought by the old SEC have now been dropped. These included lawsuits that had put crypto exchanges and protocols under legal pressure for years. Scott ended his op-ed by saying, ‚ÄúRegulatory certainty is essential to cementing our status as the crypto capital of the world. Just as essential is executing on the recommendations from today‚Äôs report on crypto regulation.‚Äù Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

2025-08-01T17:03:08,"How Are Bitcoin and Ethereum Prices Performing in August? Historical Data Speaks for Itself","Bitcoin investors may be entering their toughest period of the year. Historically, August and September are among the weakest performing months for Bitcoin (BTC). Prices have fallen in these two months in 8 of the last 12 years, implying a probability of decline of approximately 67%. Data shows that Bitcoin generally performs poorly in the third quarters (July‚ÄìSeptember). Specifically, it experienced significant declines, such as -2.85% in the third quarter of 2022, -21.51% in 2019, -2.85% in 2018, and -13.54% in 2014. Bitcoin's average third-quarter return was only 1.46%, while the median return was -1.46%. On the other hand, the first quarter of the year is generally positive for Bitcoin. For example, strong Q1 returns of 68.68% were recorded in 2023, 102.93% in 2021, and 11.89% in 2019. Related News: Major Split Within the Fed - Two Members Begin to Oppose Chair Jerome Powell, Here Are Their Statements August has been the month with the most negative returns over the last 12 years, with notable declines such as -13.88% in 2022, -17.27% in 2014, and -9.05% in 2013. September is historically the weakest month, with declines of -24.92% in 2014, -13.38% in 2019, and -3.59% in 2022. The average September return remains in negative territory. Similar to Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH) also performs poorly in third quarters. For example, while ETH gained +25.01% in Q3 2022, it experienced declines of -18.9% in 2021, -38.82% in 2019, and -37.28% in 2018.

While the US government has not disclosed specific figures, estimates from Nansen place current federal Bitcoin holdings at over 198,000 BTC, valued at approximately $22.8 billion. Hines notes that the Trump administration has not yet provided a timeline for further disclosures but indicated that BTC accumulation is ongoing and aligned with long-term infrastructure planning. He also expressed strong confidence in the government‚Äôs approach to BTC, suggesting that the public would be pleased with the direction in which the Bitcoin Reserve process is moving. The Trump administration also appears to be prioritizing clearer regulations for the crypto space . However, Hines emphasized that, for now, the primary focus remains on accumulating and building the nation‚Äôs BTC holdings. Crypto Policy Report Outlines Regulatory Priorities In a report featuring the interview, Hines outlined broader policy efforts underway at the federal level, including the push for regulatory clarity, the implementation of the GENIUS Act , and the passage of the anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act , which aims to ban central bank digital currencies permanently. The Trump administration‚Äôs crypto report also emphasizes the creation of a consistent, legal, and operational environment for digital finance, potentially positioning the US as a leader in digital innovation. According to Hines, pending leadership changes have also been put in focus. President Trump nominated Brian Quintenz, the former CFTC Commissioner, as the next chairman of the independent US agency‚Äîa move that could significantly influence the regulatory approach towards cryptocurrencies. While the White House delayed the nomination, the decision is set to be part of a broader effort to align financial policy with evolving digital assets.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/strategic-bitcoin-reserve-in-play/,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK|AIRDROP|XLM|LTC|CFX|FLOKI|MX|COMMODITY|ONDO|ENA|GALA|BTG|MATIC|LINK","Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin strategic reserve|Brian Quintenz|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|CBDC Surveillance State Act|CFTC|Crypto In America|Donald Trump|GENIUS Act|Nansen|Robert Bo Hines|The White House",cryptocompare
2025-08-01T17:00:01,"Analyst Says Bitcoin Crash Has Just Started, It‚Äôs Over for Bulls. Here‚Äôs why","Bitcoin is once again under pressure , and according to prominent analyst Gordon, the long-feared breakdown is now in full motion. In a recent post on X, Gordon declared, ‚ÄúBTC crash has just started. It‚Äôs over for bulls,‚Äù accompanying the warning with a technical chart that paints a stark picture. His analysis suggests Bitcoin has broken out of a bearish reversal pattern with significant downside potential. A Head and Shoulders Breakdown Signals Trouble Gordon‚Äôs chart shows a classic Head and Shoulders formation, a time-tested bearish reversal pattern. The structure includes a left shoulder (LS) formed in February, a higher peak or ‚Äúhead‚Äù in April, and a right shoulder (RS) formed by June. The neckline, a key level of horizontal support around $112,00, was decisively broken in late July. After a failed retest of this neckline, Bitcoin began plunging again, confirming what many chartists feared: a full technical breakdown. Gordon projects a continuation of this bearish trend, potentially targeting levels below $100,000. $BTC crash has just started It's over for bulls pic.twitter.com/n0PHlgfQ4H ‚Äî Gordon (@AltcoinGordon) August 1, 2025 Bitcoin Price Action Confirms the Breakdown As of report time, Bitcoin is trading around $114,700, having lost more than 6% from its July high of $122,838. In the past 24 hours alone, the cryptocurrency is down approximately 3.2%. Price action confirms that bulls are losing ground rapidly, with each attempt to reclaim previous support levels being rejected. The $112,000 zone, now turned resistance, is proving too strong for bulls to overcome. This failed reclaim only strengthens Gordon‚Äôs bearish thesis. A daily close below $114,000 could accelerate selling pressure as traders react to the confirmed Head and Shoulders collapse. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Macroeconomic Risks Amplify Bearish Sentiment The technical setup isn‚Äôt the only thing weighing on Bitcoin. The broader macroeconomic environment is compounding the decline. Recent U.S. tariff policies under President Donald Trump have rattled global markets, with crypto assets among the hardest hit. According to Barron‚Äôs, the renewed trade tensions have triggered broad risk-off behavior, prompting investors to move capital out of volatile assets like Bitcoin. Additionally, fading hopes of a near-term interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve have cooled enthusiasm from institutional investors. As economic uncertainty rises, liquidity is drying up in speculative markets, leaving Bitcoin exposed to sharper corrections. What‚Äôs Next for BTC? While long-term bulls point to declining exchange balances and steady whale accumulation as signs of strength, these factors have so far failed to stop the current slide. Some analysts support the view that Bitcoin may continue to retrace , citing deteriorating volume, weakening momentum, and historic cycle timing. Some even warn of a potential drop to $85,000 if support levels around $102,000 fail. For now, the message is clear: the bullish trend has been broken, and unless Bitcoin can reclaim $116,000‚Äì$118,000 in the near term, the path of least resistance is downward. Gordon‚Äôs warning may have arrived just in time for those still holding on to hope. The charts are now doing the talking, and they‚Äôre not bullish.
