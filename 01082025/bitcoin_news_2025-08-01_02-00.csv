Per an official Rosseti North Caucasus press release , illegal miners accounted for over 94% of all the electrical power stolen in the republic in the first half of the year Illegal Miners in Russian BTC Hotspot ‚ÄòStole 35.4M kWh‚Äô The firm said that the total volume of unaccounted consumption in the republic in the same time period was 37.5 million kWh. This power was worth over $4.4 million, Rosseti added. The Russian republic of Ingushetia. (Source: Timur Ziev [CC BY-SA 3.0]) But almost all of this was attributable to illegal crypto miners, the power provider said. These miners stole 35.4 million kWh from the grid. The firm said the lion‚Äôs share of the power was stolen at four large ‚Äúillegal mining farms.‚Äù The provider suggested it had shut down all four, adding that it had seized 450 rigs from the farms. In the first half of the year, the republic‚Äôs power firm Ingushenergo said its specialists identified 177 cases of illegal electricity use. Providers Use Drones to Hunt Illegal Miners Crypto mining is illegal during the winter months in Ingushetia until March 15, 2031. It has also been banned in neighboring North Caucasus republics. However, Bitcoin mining remains popular throughout the region, and has been blamed for a series of power outages in Ingushetia. In nearby Abkhazia, observers say entire villages now ‚Äúbuzz‚Äù with the sound of whirring crypto mining hardware .

Bitcoin Focus Russian law stipulates that firms and individuals can mine crypto without informing the tax authorities if they use less than 6,000 kWh of power per month. However, industrial miners who do not register with the Federal Tax Service will likely face criminal punishment under new proposals.

2025-07-31T23:25:11,"Urgent: Bitcoin Price Drop Alarms Investors as BTC Falls Below $116,000","BitcoinWorld Urgent: Bitcoin Price Drop Alarms Investors as BTC Falls Below $116,000 The cryptocurrency market is a whirlwind of excitement and, at times, sudden shifts. Today, that volatility has once again taken center stage as Bitcoin, the undisputed king of digital assets, experienced a significant Bitcoin price drop , falling below the crucial $116,000 mark. According to market monitoring from Bitcoin World, BTC is currently trading at $115,992.4 on the Binance USDT market. This latest dip has certainly sent ripples of concern and speculation throughout the investor community, prompting many to ask: what‚Äôs happening, and what does this mean for the future of crypto? What Triggered This Sudden Bitcoin Price Drop? Understanding the forces behind a Bitcoin price drop is crucial. While a single cause is rarely identifiable, several factors often converge. This recent dip could stem from macroeconomic indicators, large-scale whale movements, or technical analysis patterns. Global economic uncertainties, like inflation or interest rate hikes, often lead investors to de-risk. Regulatory news, even speculative, can also create FUD that triggers sell-offs. Furthermore, the actions of large holders, ‚Äúwhales,‚Äù significantly impact market dynamics. A substantial sell-off can flood the market, pushing prices down. Technically, Bitcoin might have encountered strong resistance or broken key support levels, leading to cascading liquidations. Broader negative market sentiment can also amplify a Bitcoin price drop . How Does This Bitcoin Price Drop Impact the Broader Crypto Market? Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance means its movements often dictate the entire market. When Bitcoin experiences a significant Bitcoin price drop , altcoins typically follow, often with more exaggerated movements. This is Bitcoin‚Äôs ‚Äúgravitational pull.‚Äù Investors view Bitcoin as the benchmark, and its performance influences confidence across the board. A BTC dip can lead to widespread selling pressure on other digital assets. While some altcoins might show resilience, these are exceptions during major BTC corrections. The current Bitcoin price drop highlights the interconnectedness of the crypto ecosystem. Here‚Äôs a quick look at recent Bitcoin price points: Date/Time (Approx.) Bitcoin Price (USD) Change Prior Peak (Recent) ~$120,000 ‚Äì Current Trading Price $115,992.4 Significant Drop Support Level (Previous) ~$116,500 Broken This table illustrates the recent shift and the breach of a temporary support level, reinforcing current bearish sentiment. Navigating the Volatility: Strategies After a Bitcoin Price Drop For investors, a sudden Bitcoin price drop can be unsettling. However, it also presents an opportunity to reassess strategies. Panic selling is rarely optimal. Instead, consider these actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Thoroughly research market conditions, assets, and influencing news. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Invest a fixed amount at regular intervals, regardless of price. This mitigates buying at peaks and is effective during a Bitcoin price drop . HODL (Hold On for Dear Life): For long-term investors believing in Bitcoin‚Äôs value, holding through dips is common. Historically, Bitcoin has recovered from pullbacks. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Diversify your portfolio. Set stop-loss orders to limit losses. Market cycles are natural. Understanding them and having a predefined strategy helps you remain calm and rational during intense volatility, such as a significant Bitcoin price drop . Is This Bitcoin Price Drop a Buying Opportunity? The question on many minds during a significant Bitcoin price drop is whether it‚Äôs a ‚Äúbuy the dip‚Äù opportunity. Historically, major corrections have often led to recovery and growth. However, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future results. Distinguishing a true buying opportunity from a ‚Äúfalling knife‚Äù depends on perspective, risk tolerance, and long-term outlook. For those with strong conviction in Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term trajectory ‚Äì its role as digital gold, increasing institutional adoption, and finite supply ‚Äì a dip might be a chance to accumulate at a discount. Bitcoin‚Äôs underlying technology and network fundamentals remain strong, irrespective of short-term fluctuations. For short-term traders, such dips carry higher risks. Conduct thorough due diligence and align decisions with your financial goals and risk appetite. Evaluate market sentiment, technicals, and fundamental news to decide if this Bitcoin price drop aligns with your strategy. The current Bitcoin price drop below $116,000 serves as a powerful reminder of crypto market volatility. While alarming, such movements are characteristic of this asset class. Understanding triggers, ripple effects, and employing sound strategies are paramount. Whether you choose to HODL, DCA, or seek opportunities, staying informed and disciplined is key. The crypto market rewards patience and well-researched decisions, not impulsive reactions. As Bitcoin continues its journey, these price fluctuations will undoubtedly remain a recurring theme. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why did Bitcoin‚Äôs price drop below $116,000? A1: The recent Bitcoin price drop can be attributed to a combination of factors including macroeconomic concerns, large-scale selling by ‚Äúwhales,‚Äù and technical market movements. Global economic uncertainties and regulatory news often play a significant role in investor sentiment, leading to sell-offs. Q2: How does a Bitcoin price drop affect other cryptocurrencies? A2: Due to Bitcoin‚Äôs market dominance, a significant Bitcoin price drop typically leads to a ripple effect across the broader altcoin market. Most altcoins tend to follow Bitcoin‚Äôs trend, often experiencing more exaggerated declines, though some with strong fundamentals might show resilience. Q3: Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? A3: Whether a Bitcoin price drop is a ‚Äúgood time to buy‚Äù depends on an individual‚Äôs investment strategy, risk tolerance, and long-term outlook. Historically, dips have often been followed by recoveries, but past performance doesn‚Äôt guarantee future results. It‚Äôs crucial to do your own research (DYOR) and consider dollar-cost averaging. Q4: What are the best strategies to manage risk during a Bitcoin price drop? A4: Effective strategies include dollar-cost averaging (DCA), holding for the long term (HODL) if you believe in Bitcoin‚Äôs fundamentals, diversifying your portfolio, and only investing what you can afford to lose. Setting stop-loss orders can also help limit potential losses. Q5: How often does Bitcoin experience significant price drops? A5: Bitcoin is known for its volatility, and significant price drops are a regular occurrence in its history. These corrections are a natural part of its market cycles, driven by various internal and external factors. Understanding this volatility is key to long-term investing in crypto.

2025-07-31T23:14:12,"Riot Platforms tops rival Marathon with Q2 earnings making all-time high","Riot Platforms beat out its rival Marathon Digital in the second-quarter earnings race, reporting the strongest financials of any Bitcoin mining firm so far in 2025. The Colorado-based company published its results after the Closing Bell, showing $219.5 million in net income and $495.3 million in adjusted EBITDA. The numbers cover the three-month period ending June 30, 2025, and were disclosed alongside its full earnings presentation on the company‚Äôs website, according to a press release published via Globe Newswire. Jason Les, Riot‚Äôs Chief Executive Officer, credited the rising price of Bitcoin as a key reason behind the company‚Äôs best-ever quarter. Riot saw total revenue surge to $153 million, more than double the $70 million it posted in the same quarter last year. That leap was mostly fueled by its Bitcoin mining revenue, which hit $140.9 million, up from $55.8 million a year earlier. Bitcoin production jumps despite halving and rising mining costs Riot mined a total of 1,426 Bitcoin during the quarter, a significant jump from 844 Bitcoin mined in Q2 of 2024. But the company didn‚Äôt mine them cheaply. The average cost to mine each coin, excluding depreciation, jumped to $48,992, up from $25,329 in the same period last year. The sharp increase came after the April 2024 halving, which cut miner rewards in half, and a 45% increase in the global hash rate, which made mining more competitive and expensive. Les said Riot‚Äôs current strength is the result of years of investment in infrastructure, mining scale, and power procurement. He explained the company‚Äôs strategy revolves around what he called their ‚Äúready-for-service power portfolio,‚Äù which includes two of Riot‚Äôs major operational hubs; Rockdale and Corsicana. The company is now moving more of its available energy resources into data centers as demand for high-performance computing keeps growing. Riot recently hired Jonathan Gibbs as Chief Data Center Officer to lead that transition. Les described Gibbs as one of several key leadership additions meant to help the company expand into new territory beyond Bitcoin mining ‚ÄúWe are immensely proud of our evolution over the past several years,‚Äù Les said. He said Riot is in a strong position to ‚Äúmaximize utilization of our significant power capacity‚Äù while still riding the Bitcoin cycle. Vertical integration and strong reserves boost Riot‚Äôs position Engineering revenue for the second quarter also rose slightly, hitting $10.6 million, compared to $9.6 million in Q2 of 2024. Riot said much of that benefit comes from its December 2021 acquisition of ESS Metron, a move that has saved the company $18.5 million in capital expenditures since then. The acquisition allowed Riot to integrate power infrastructure engineering directly into its operations, giving it tighter control over supply chains and spending. As of the end of June, Riot held 19,273 Bitcoin on its books, with 3,300 BTC held as collateral. Based on the June 30 market price of $107,174 per Bitcoin, the total value of those holdings comes out to roughly $2.1 billion. The company also reported a strong cash position, with $255.4 million in unrestricted cash, $74.9 million in restricted cash, and $62.5 million in marketable securities. That brought Riot‚Äôs working capital to $141.1 million. Despite the huge quarter, Riot‚Äôs stock dropped 0.81% in after-hours trading. The company gave no explanation for the dip, and no executives commented on it during the release. Investors may have already priced in the earnings or reacted to broader crypto market movements, but the drop came immediately after the announcement.

2025-07-31T23:01:23,"JPMorgan Spots Ripple‚Äôs Potential to Disrupt Traditional Payment Systems","Crypto researcher SMQKE published a post on X highlighting internal JPMorgan material that explicitly references Ripple as a viable blockchain solution for solving global interoperability and data challenges in the financial system. According to the visuals shared, JPMorgan appears to acknowledge Ripple‚Äôs technological infrastructure as a means of enabling secure, low-cost, and fast cross-border transfers, underlining the company‚Äôs capability to interconnect disparate financial systems. One slide in the shared document, carrying the JPMorgan watermark, features Ripple as an example of blockchain-based processing. It states that Ripple utilizes a cloud-based ledger to facilitate international fund transfers while leveraging existing financial infrastructure. The diagram in the slide explains the step-by-step process of how Ripple‚Äôs network operates, including the role of a market maker that handles the currencies of both sender and receiver to complete the transaction efficiently. The flow demonstrates Ripple‚Äôs functionality in obtaining foreign exchange rates, processing payments, and enabling fast cross-border settlement between financial institutions. J.P. Morgan has identified Ripple as a blockchain-based payment network with the potential to disrupt traditional payment systems. The old guard was always paying attention. Documented. https://t.co/vMFtl2kl5e pic.twitter.com/VuhE7gd2zV ‚Äî SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) July 30, 2025 Ripple Among Customizable Global Payment Network Leaders The second slide from the presentation, also bearing the JPMorgan label, focuses on the emergence of cloud-based global payment networks. The segment titled ‚ÄúDisruptors‚Äù presents Ripple alongside other prominent cryptocurrency-based systems such as Bitcoin , Litecoin, and Dash. The inclusion of Ripple in this section supports the broader assessment that blockchain platforms are not just theoretical concepts but have matured into technologies with practical, scalable applications. This part of the presentation describes these networks as customized solutions addressing specific payment needs, particularly those centered on compliance and innovation. Ripple is shown as one of the blockchain networks that has already contributed to solving geographic interoperability issues. The slide emphasizes how such solutions are compliant and leverage today‚Äôs technological capabilities to deliver real-world utility, suggesting JPMorgan‚Äôs awareness of Ripple‚Äôs practical use in financial ecosystems. Francis Hadlocon Highlights Strategic Backing Behind Ripple In response to SMQKE‚Äôs post, X user Francis Hadlocon offered a perspective that reinforces the significance of Ripple‚Äôs placement in the JPMorgan material. According to Hadlocon, the institutions that handle multi-trillion-dollar movements are not investing in speculative digital assets but are instead aligning with blockchain platforms capable of moving vast sums of money efficiently. He added that Ripple is not a future entrant into the space; it is already part of the underlying architecture supporting institutional-grade finance. His remarks imply that JPMorgan‚Äôs recognition of Ripple, even if subtle, is a confirmation of its established presence in the infrastructure of modern payment systems. Documentation Reflects Legacy Institutions Monitoring Blockchain Advancements SMQKE concludes the tweet by stating that the ‚Äúold guard was always paying attention,‚Äù implying that legacy financial institutions like JPMorgan have long been monitoring the evolution of blockchain technologies such as Ripple. The word ‚ÄúDocumented‚Äù underlines that this is not a speculative assertion but a direct reference backed by corporate materials from one of the world‚Äôs largest banks. The use of Ripple in JPMorgan‚Äôs internal presentations serves as a tangible acknowledgment of the firm‚Äôs relevance in blockchain-driven financial innovation. Taken together, the information shared in SMQKE‚Äôs tweet and the slides attributed to JPMorgan provide further evidence of Ripple‚Äôs position in institutional financial strategy. The imagery and structure in the presentation identify Ripple as a blockchain-enabled payment rail recognized for its capability to address global interoperability, regulatory compliance, and transaction efficiency.

2025-07-31T23:00:50,"4 Top Cryptos to Watch Now With Real Utility:¬† BlockDAG, Hyperliquid, Cardano, & Dogecoin!","As the crypto space enters another critical phase, enthusiasts are asking the same question: which are the top cryptos to watch now? While many assets are circulating, only a few display a strong mix of growth, real-world use, and positive traction. The spotlight is now on select coins that are making significant moves through tech updates, adoption, or presale strength. Among them, BlockDAG has turned heads with one of the biggest presale stories to date. Below are four coins that stand out from the rest this month. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG) Rising attention surrounds BlockDAG (BDAG) as the spotlight remains fixed on August 11, the date of its GLOBAL LAUNCH release. This day will see the closing of its 10 BTC Auction, the announcement of winners, and the rollout of the GLOBAL LAUNCH update, a combination that adds momentum to the presale‚Äôs conclusion. Many see it as a rare alignment of timing, community interest, and platform development. BlockDAG has so far pulled in $357 million in presale funding, placing it among the highest earners this cycle. A total of 24.5 billion BDAG coins have already been sold, and current sales are running in Batch 29 at a price of $0.0016, which is available until August 11. Since Batch 1, early participants have already seen their funds grow by 2,660%. These gains are fueling even more attention ahead of the GLOBAL LAUNCH release. BlockDAG isn‚Äôt only relying on sales buzz. The project has confirmed over 20 exchange listings and is supported by U.S.-based sports teams like the Seattle Seawolves and Seattle Orcas. Its wide outreach across crypto, sports, and retail has driven user growth. For those searching for the top cryptos to watch now, BlockDAG currently offers a rare mix of growth, updates, and solid network backing. 2. Hyperliquid (HYPR) DeFi participants are taking note of Hyperliquid thanks to its approach to fully on-chain derivatives trading. Its structure removes centralized elements, offering users high-speed, low-fee access to permissionless markets, an appealing combination for advanced crypto users and developers. The recent rollout of its native HYPR token has added further appeal. With early positive performance, the platform is now seeing steady adoption. Liquidity-based rewards and governance models are pulling more users in, especially as institutions look to enter more technical DeFi setups. Though not as headline-driven as BlockDAG, Hyperliquid shows promise through clear fundamentals. From a DeFi infrastructure view, it ranks high among the top cryptos to watch now, especially for those who prefer substance over hype. 3. Cardano (ADA) Among the coins known for academic and security-first development, Cardano remains a strong contender. Recent updates, including the Chang Hard Fork, have strengthened the network‚Äôs decentralization, offering developers more tools to build on ADA‚Äôs ecosystem. The growing number of DeFi projects and rising transaction activity add relevance to ADA‚Äôs current position. With renewed interest from large holders, the coin may enter a slow but steady upward phase in the near term. Even though BlockDAG is currently seeing faster momentum, Cardano continues to appeal to long-term crypto watchers. For those viewing the market from a value-building standpoint, ADA remains one of the top cryptos to watch now. 4. Dogecoin (DOGE) Meme coins may seem like yesterday‚Äôs news, but Dogecoin continues to attract attention with its unique combination of social media backing and real-world presence. It maintains availability across nearly all major exchanges and benefits from ongoing mainstream visibility. DOGE‚Äôs movements are often tied to sentiment, influencer activity, and short-term hype cycles. This makes it volatile but still valuable for those who understand its timing-based potential. It‚Äôs not about tech innovation, it‚Äôs about brand power and staying relevant. Despite its unpredictable nature, Dogecoin remains a major player. With rumors of new integrations occasionally driving surges, it still qualifies as one of the top cryptos to watch now for those interested in short-term moves. Final Thoughts on the Top Cryptos to Watch Now Each project stands out for a specific reason: Dogecoin thrives on viral appeal, Cardano emphasizes solid fundamentals, and Hyperliquid develops advanced tools for on-chain trading. Meanwhile, BlockDAG brings together strategic marketing, perfect timing, real utility, and strong community backing in one focused launch plan. With the 10 BTC Auction, $357 million in presale funds, and its GLOBAL LAUNCH release all set for August 11, BDAG is firmly in the spotlight. While your choice may vary based on personal goals, BlockDAG currently presents one of the strongest cases among the top cryptos to watch now .
