2025-07-18T08:51:35,"Missed Pi Network‚Äôs Pi2Day? Here‚Äôs Everything You Need to Know","TL;DR Pi Network‚Äôs Core Team organized an online event that took place from June 28 (known as Pi2Day) until July 7, which had numerous activities and also saw the launch of two crucial features. A few weeks after its completion, the team has published a recap outlining the most important takeaways of the event. Pi App Studio and Challenge The blog posts noted that more than 2.6 million Pioneers (users within the project‚Äôs ecosystem) took part in the Pi2Day Ecosystem Challenge, and 761,000 of them ‚Äúpowered through every step to claim this year‚Äôs limited-edition username badge and color.‚Äù ‚ÄúParticipation was strong across regions, showing community engagement and eagerness to explore and test new utilities as soon as they launch,‚Äù reads the statement. It also focuses on arguably the most significant new feature for users ‚Äì the Pi App Studio. The team describes it as a ‚Äúno-code, AI-assisted platform, which enables anyone ‚Äì regardless of technical background ‚Äì to build and own functional apps in Pi‚Äôs decentralized ecosystem.‚Äù Since its launch, nearly 35,000 community members have participated in some form, creating more than 7,600 chatbots and over 14,000 custom apps. The team provided a few examples of newly-launched apps, such as one chatbot providing information on space and the universe, and another that focuses on Pioneers living a healthier lifestyle. It‚Äôs worth noting, though, that the Core Team said they do not verify, evaluate, endorse, or review the applications launched through the Pi App Studio and are available through the Pi Browser, and warned: ‚ÄúYour use of these apps is at your own risk, and we strongly encourage you to use caution when using them.‚Äù Pi Staking The other significant new feature, which is perhaps even more important for Pi investors, is called Ecosystem Directory Staking. As the name suggests, it allows Pi token holders to stake their tokens, but in a relatively different manner. EDS is a platform-level utility enabling businesses and users to ‚Äúboost the ranking of Pi apps in the Ecosystem Interface by staking Pi tokens on the Mainnet blockchain.‚Äù Even though it has been live for less than a month, it has already attracted almost 38 million Pi in total, with over 25 million tokens still actively staked. The number of Pioneers taking advantage of this feature is above 16,700. ‚ÄúThe staking feature introduced a community-driven way to surface apps and services that Pioneers and businesses want to promote and support.‚Äù Although staking allows investors to lock their tokens for a certain period to earn rewards and reduce the selling pressure, the underlying asset has not felt the benefits yet. Its price is down by 10% weekly and almost 19% monthly to $0.45. Just for reference, many other crypto assets, including BTC and XRP , have gone vertical within this timeframe with new all-time highs. The post Missed Pi Network‚Äôs Pi2Day?

2025-07-18T08:50:30,"Anthropic Claude‚Äôs Alarming New Usage Limits Spark Outcry","BitcoinWorld Anthropic Claude‚Äôs Alarming New Usage Limits Spark Outcry In the fast-evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, where innovation often outpaces established norms, a recent development has sent ripples of concern through the developer community. Users of Anthropic Claude , a leading AI model known for its advanced capabilities, have suddenly encountered unexpected and unannounced usage limits, sparking frustration and disrupting ongoing projects. This abrupt change raises questions about transparency and the future reliability of essential Developer AI tools . Anthropic Claude Users Face Unexpected Restrictions Since Monday morning, a significant number of Anthropic Claude users, particularly those heavily reliant on the service, have been met with perplexing restrictions. These unexpected changes have manifested as abrupt ‚ÄòClaude usage limit reached‚Äô messages, often accompanied by a vague time frame for reset. The core issue? A complete lack of official communication from Anthropic regarding these new limitations. Many affected users, especially those subscribed to the premium $200-a-month Claude Max plan , voiced their concerns on Claude Code‚Äôs GitHub page. The sentiment is clear: users feel blindsided. One user articulated this frustration, stating, ‚ÄúYour tracking of usage limits has changed and is no longer accurate. There is no way in the 30 minutes of a few requests I have hit the 900 messages.‚Äù This indicates a perceived discrepancy between their actual usage and the new, undisclosed limits. Navigating New AI Usage Limits: A Sudden Shift The sudden imposition of new AI usage limits without prior notice presents a significant challenge for developers and businesses integrating Claude Code into their workflows. For many, these models are not just tools but critical components of their operational infrastructure. The inability to predict or plan for these restrictions effectively halts progress and introduces an element of unreliability. An Anthropic representative acknowledged the issues, stating, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre aware that some Claude Code users are experiencing slower response times, and we‚Äôre working to resolve these issues.‚Äù However, this brief statement failed to address the core concern: the unannounced usage limits themselves. This ambiguity has left users in the dark, unable to ascertain whether these are temporary glitches or permanent policy shifts. The broader network issues reported during the same period, including API overload errors and six separate incidents on Anthropic‚Äôs status page over four days, further compound the problem. While the status page oddly still shows ‚Äò100 percent uptime‚Äô for the week, the user experience paints a different picture, highlighting a disconnect between reported metrics and real-world performance. The Claude Max Plan Conundrum: Value vs. Viability The $200-a-month Claude Max plan , designed for heavy users, promised usage limits 20 times higher than a Pro subscription. However, the recent changes cast a shadow over this value proposition. Users who invested in this premium tier are now finding their access curtailed, leading to questions about the plan‚Äôs long-term viability. One user, speaking anonymously to Bitcoin World, highlighted the severe impact: ‚ÄúIt just stopped the ability to make progress.‚Äù This individual, who often makes over $1000 worth of API calls daily on the Max plan, admitted that such high usage might be unsustainable for Anthropic. Yet, the expectation was for transparent communication, not sudden, unannounced cutbacks. The core of the problem lies in Anthropic‚Äôs ambiguous pricing structure. While tiered limits exist, the company explicitly states that free user limits ‚Äúwill vary by demand‚Äù and avoids setting absolute values. This ‚Äòflexible‚Äô approach, now seemingly extended to paid plans, makes it impossible for users to plan their projects around consistent access, creating an unpredictable environment for development. Impact on Developer AI Tools and Productivity For developers deeply embedded in their projects, the unexpected limitations on their primary Developer AI tools like Claude Code have a cascading effect on productivity. The user who spoke to Bitcoin World lamented the lack of comparable alternatives, stating, ‚ÄúI tried Gemini and Kimi, but there‚Äôs really nothing else that‚Äôs competitive with the capability set of Claude Code right now.‚Äù This highlights Anthropic‚Äôs strong market position but also the significant dependence users have on its capabilities. The disruption forces developers to either halt their work, significantly slow down, or attempt to migrate to less capable platforms, all of which incur substantial costs in terms of time, effort, and potential project delays. This situation underscores the critical need for stability and predictability when relying on third-party AI services for mission-critical applications. Why Anthropic Transparency Matters: Rebuilding Trust The most significant casualty of this episode is trust. The lack of Anthropic transparency regarding these crucial changes has eroded user confidence. When a service alters its core access parameters without warning, it creates an environment of uncertainty and suspicion. As the anonymous user aptly put it, ‚ÄúJust be transparent. The lack of communication just causes people to lose confidence in them.‚Äù In a competitive AI landscape, where developers have choices, albeit limited for specific capabilities, clear and proactive communication is paramount. It allows users to adapt, plan, and maintain faith in the service provider. Building and maintaining trust through open dialogue about service changes, pricing adjustments, or network limitations is not just good business practice; it is essential for fostering a loyal and productive user base. Anthropic has an opportunity to address these concerns head-on, clarify its policies, and work towards rebuilding the confidence of its valuable developer community. The recent unannounced AI usage limits on Anthropic Claude Code have undeniably created a challenging situation for its user base, particularly those on the premium Claude Max plan . This incident underscores the delicate balance between a service provider‚Äôs operational sustainability and its commitment to user experience and transparency. While the high usage of some premium users might indeed pose a challenge for Anthropic, the chosen method of implementing changes has led to widespread frustration and a significant erosion of trust. For the AI industry as a whole, this serves as a critical reminder: as powerful Developer AI tools become integral to daily operations, clear communication, predictable service levels, and a user-centric approach are non-negotiable. Developers and businesses rely on these tools to innovate and grow, and their ability to do so hinges on the reliability and trustworthiness of the underlying AI platforms. Anthropic now faces the task of addressing these concerns directly, ensuring its future growth is built on a foundation of open communication and user confidence, demonstrating true Anthropic transparency .

2025-07-18T08:46:50,"UK Minister Urges Ban on Crypto Political Donations Over Foreign Influence Fears","Amid rising concerns that foreign powers could exploit untraceable cryptocurrency to sway British politics, UK Cabinet Office Minister Pat McFadden has called for election officials to consider banning political donations made in digital currencies. Key Takeaways: UK minister Pat McFadden has asked for a review of crypto political donations. Campaigners warn that unregulated crypto donations could enable covert foreign influence. Lawmakers call for stronger enforcement and transparency. Speaking to MPs, McFadden said tracing crypto donations is challenging, urging the Electoral Commission to review whether current rules are fit for purpose in the evolving digital age. McFadden‚Äôs remarks follow Nigel Farage‚Äôs announcement that his Reform UK party would become the first British political group to accept Bitcoin donations , echoing moves by Donald Trump‚Äôs 2024 campaign. Crypto Donations Could Enable Covert Foreign Interference in Politics Campaigners like Spotlight on Corruption warn that such practices could open doors for covert foreign interference, undermining democratic processes. During a joint Commons and Lords committee session on national security, Labour MP Liam Byrne pressed McFadden on the issue, prompting the minister to stress the importance of transparency and legislative updates to protect the integrity of political funding. Further concerns were raised about donations from ‚Äúunlimited companies,‚Äù whose financial records are difficult to scrutinize. Both McFadden and Byrne agreed that strengthening resources for the Electoral Commission and the National Crime Agency is essential to better police political finances. Byrne described current party finance rules as a ‚ÄúKremlin‚Äôs charter‚Äù favoring opacity, calling for bans on crypto donations and foreign money, alongside enhanced enforcement. NIGEL FARAGE'S REFORM UK BECOMES THE 1ST PARTY IN BRITAIN TO ACCEPT #BITCOIN DONATIONS pic.twitter.com/9ZQXtvNPIL ‚Äî The Bitcoin Conference (@TheBitcoinConf) May 29, 2025 While McFadden‚Äôs comments signal openness to tighter crypto donation controls, government sources indicate upcoming election reform proposals may stop short of an outright ban. Instead, the forthcoming strategy paper is expected to tighten general foreign interference rules, extend them to digital currencies, and promote voter registration reforms, such as lowering the voting age to 16 and protecting candidates from abuse. Transparency campaigners remain wary that the government may avoid capping donations or restoring the Electoral Commission‚Äôs criminal investigation powers. As calls grow for stronger donation checks, including peer Margaret Hodge and democracy advocate Tom Brake, the debate continues over how to safeguard UK democracy against evolving threats in the digital era. UK to Enforce Mandatory Crypto Trade Reporting The UK will require crypto firms to collect and report detailed customer information on every trade and transfer starting January 1, 2026, as part of a sweeping effort to strengthen tax compliance and oversight in the digital asset sector. According to a recent statement from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the new rules will mandate that platforms record full names, home addresses, and tax identification numbers for all users. Each transaction must also be logged with specifics such as the cryptocurrency used and the amount transferred. The reporting obligation extends beyond individual users to include companies, trusts, and charities engaged in crypto activity. Firms that fail to comply or submit inaccurate data may face penalties of up to ¬£300 ($398) per user.

2025-07-18T08:33:41,"SharpLink unlocks $6B in new capital to supercharge Ethereum buys","SharpLink has increased its share offering capacity from $1 billion to $6 billion to potentially fund more of its aggressive Ethereum (ETH) buys. In its updated prospectus filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on July 18, the company disclosed amendments to its previous May 30 registration. The latest filing raises the total amount of common stock that the company may sell under its at-the-market (ATM) program to $6 billion, up from the initial $1 billion. So far, the Joseph Lubin-backed firm has already sold approximately $720 million worth of shares under the earlier prospectus and may now offer up to $5 billion more under the amended agreement. The filing also includes an amendment to the company‚Äôs sales agreement with A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners, allowing for forward sales of its common stock. Compensation terms have been revised accordingly, with A.G.P. entitled to a 2.5% commission on the first $1 billion in sales, 2% on subsequent sales, and 4% for any forward transactions. According to the prospectus, SharpLink intends to allocate most of the proceeds to acquiring Ether (ETH), while also reserving some capital for working capital, general corporate purposes, and operational expenses. Although many in the crypto space view this as a bullish move for both the company and the world‚Äôs largest altcoin, shareholders have yet to reflect that optimism. SharpLink‚Äôs shares closed at $36.40 on July 17 before falling 4.95% to $34.60 in after-hours trading. That could change soon, however, given Ethereum‚Äôs strong performance over the past week, with the asset climbing more than 20% and breaking past key resistance levels. SharpLink could target 1% ETH supply SharpLink‚Äôs expanded fundraising push is expected to supercharge its Ethereum-focused treasury strategy. By significantly increasing the share sale limit, the company now has more headroom to purchase larger volumes of ETH in the coming months, with its treasury strategy seemingly aligned toward a long-term target of accumulating at least 1 million ETH in its balance sheet. If fully utilised at current prices, the new offering could give SharpLink control of nearly 1.38% of ETH‚Äôs circulating supply. Since launching its treasury program in June, SharpLink has consistently increased its ETH holdings in strategic tranches. The firm has already added $515 million worth of ETH in the past nine days, including a single-day buy of over 32,000 ETH. As of July 16, SharpLink held more than 280,000 ETH, with 99.7% of it staked to earn on-chain yield. Its latest purchases came shortly after raising $413 million through its ATM program in early July. Between June 2 and July 15, the company generated 415 ETH in staking rewards, valued at roughly $1.49 million at the time of disclosure. More than just a treasury asset SharpLink views ETH not just as a reserve asset but as working capital. Nearly all of its ETH is staked, with additional returns generated via restaking protocols. The company‚Äôs aggressive accumulation has drawn comparisons to institutional Bitcoin strategies seen in past years. However, unlike firms that opt for passive holding, SharpLink uses Ethereum‚Äôs native staking mechanisms to compound returns while maintaining high exposure to the asset‚Äôs long-term growth. Amid this backdrop is Ethereum‚Äôs newfound status as a corporate treasury asset. Companies like Bit Digital and BitMine Immersion have followed similar paths of late and have pivoted to ETH-centric reserve models.

Semler Scientific Buys 210 Bitcoin The California-headquartered company continues to grow its exposure to the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency by market cap. According to the filing, Semler Scientific purchased 210 BTC between July 3 and July 16, spending $25 million at an average cost of $118,974 per BTC. At current market prices, the company‚Äôs total BTC holdings are valued at nearly $570 million. Meanwhile, the average acquisition cost of its Bitcoin stack stands at approximately $93,890 per BTC, with a cumulative investment of $455 million. It is worth highlighting that Semler Scientific‚Äôs latest purchase has pushed the company to the 14th position on the list of publicly traded firms with the largest BTC treasuries. This move reflects its growing commitment to Bitcoin as part of its corporate strategy. According to data from CoinGecko, Michael Saylor‚Äôs Strategy ‚Äì formerly known as MicroStrategy ‚Äì continues to be the leading publicly-traded firm with the largest Bitcoin holdings, effectively controlling almost 3% of the total BTC circulating supply. Other notable companies in the list include Marathon Digital Holdings, Metaplanet, Galaxy Digital Holdings, Tesla, and Coinbase Global. Semler Scientific is followed by GameStop which holds a total of 4,710 BTC in its treasury. In its regulatory filing, Semler Scientific reported a Year-to-Date (YTD) Bitcoin Yield of 30.3%. To explain, Bitcoin Yield is a key performance indicator for investors that reflects the growth of BTC per share. Interestingly, the company‚Äôs recent Bitcoin acquisitions have been funded largely through proceeds from an at-the-market (ATM) equity offering. Since April 2025, this offering has raised $175 million. However, Semler Scientific‚Äôs stock performance in 2025 has been underwhelming. According to Yahoo! Finance, its share price has dropped roughly 34.4% over the past six months ‚Äì from $65.98 on January 21 to $42.25 at the time of writing. Companies Accumulate BTC Despite Fresh ATH Despite Bitcoin‚Äôs historic bull run and repeated all-time highs (ATHs), corporate demand remains strong. Recently, Michael Saylor hinted that Strategy may be preparing to increase its BTC reserves once again. Japanese firm Metaplanet also continues to ramp up its BTC purchases. Most recently, the firm acquired another 800 BTC, increasing its total holdings to 15,500 BTC. Meanwhile, corporate digital asset accumulation isn‚Äôt limited to BTC. In the past 30 days alone, companies have acquired over 550,000 Ethereum (ETH).

2025-07-18T08:23:14,"Is Ethereum the next treasury asset trend?","Ethereum (ETH) rallied to a five-month high, breaking above $3,600 on track to recover a higher price range. As the coin enters an official bull market, corporate buyers are once again in the spotlight for their approach to holding ETH for the long term. Ethereum treasury companies appeared first during the period of slow accumulation, while ETH was still hovering under $2,800. The ETH treasury announcements also broke the pattern of BTC treasury companies, tapping an asset with an even bigger upside potential. ETH treasuries may also open the door to accumulating other altcoins, reviving assets from older cycles and exposing them to the liquidity of the traditional market. ETH treasuries spark honeymoon period for company stock As with the inflow of BTC treasuries, companies accumulating ETH saw their stocks revive and rally. Some of the growth is based on expectations for the appreciation of the treasuries. The stocks also offer indirect exposure to ETH, creating a flywheel to peak valuations. However, ETH treasury companies remain more volatile. Bitmine Immersion Technologies, Inc. (BMNR) rallied to over $135 soon after the treasury announcement, then slid to $41.90, consolidating at a lower baseline. SharpLink Gaming (SBET) went through another leg of expansion, recovering to $36.40 after a recent dip. SharpLink Gaming (SBET) had a secondary recovery as ETH broke to a higher price range. | Source: Google Finance . The success of the company stock led to a reevaluation of its raise program. SharpLink issued an amendment to its SEC filing, announcing a $6B ATM program for common stock, up from its previous $1B intended raise. BitDigital (BTBT) is another top performer in 2025, recently recovering to $4.01, its highest yearly level. During the latest BTC rally, the top ETH companies seem to be having a second wind, rising in expectation of an even larger bull market. Which ETH treasuries broke the $1B barrier? The recent ETH appreciation brought the two biggest ETH treasuries to over $1B. The stars of this cycle include BMNR and SBET, but other accidental whales are showing their influence. As of July 2025, there are around 55 known entities holding over 100 ETH in their reserves, while there are still around five prominent corporate buyers. A total of 55 known entities hold over 100 ETH in their wallets. BMNR and SBET compete for the top position as the equivalent of Bitcoin‚Äôs Strategy (MSTR). | Source: Strategic Eth Reserve . Taken together, the treasuries of BMNR and SBET still make up less than 0.5% of the ETH supply. In comparison, Strategy (MSTR) holds over 3% of the BTC supply following years of accumulation. The recent expansion into ETH is just the beginning, as the companies use up their first financing rounds for ETH. To date, corporations bought 1.7M ETH, still needing to catch up with ETF holding 5.1M ETH. Corporate and ETF buying taken together buy up over 186 times the newly minted supply of ETH, even with a slightly inflationary network. Combined with demand for ETH to cover leveraged positions, the new wave of corporate buyers may create a supply crunch as whales scramble to acquire easily available ETH. As the supply of ETH flows into whale wallets and treasuries, the token‚Äôs perception may shift from a utility asset for fees into a store of value. Crypto native projects may transform into treasury companies ETH has a list of holders from previous bull cycles. The current active buying of ETH has already surpassed some of the biggest fundraises, and even the holdings of the Ethereum Foundation . However, a longer list of ETH owners may join the treasury trend by rebranding their reserves. As in the case of BTC, whales and holders can utilize shell companies for fundraising, linking the idle ETH holdings to publicly tradable shares. Projects like PulseChain already hold over 166K ETH, lining up among the biggest holders. Older ICO projects like Status retain 19.7K ETH. Remaining ETH is also sitting in DAO treasuries, old ICO wallets and other reserves. Previously, some of the ETH holders traded the token or used it for operating expenses. The option to announce a treasury opens new ways of tapping the value of ETH, while also boosting scarcity. ETH staking may need additional regulation ETH tokens are not meant to stay idle. The simplest solution would be staking on the Beacon contract, which holds nearly 30% of the supply. However, as treasuries are linked to public companies, there are issues with the regulation of this form of passive income. While generally safe, staking has some technical risk for mistakes when withdrawing the stake. Some treasury companies also resort to liquid staking, adding the risk of ‚Äòslashing‚Äô. Additionally, reusing liquid staked ETH for passive income may reduce the availability of the actual ETH in the treasury, raising concerns of ownership and access. Currently, staking regulations may first come for ETF buyers, later allowing corporate buyers to explore staking access. Even without regulations, SharpLink Gaming is using its ETH reserves for staking. Since announcing the treasury, the company added around 415 ETH in staking rewards.

The company announced the decision in a statement on Thursday , revealing plans to expand its crypto portfolio beyond Bitcoin to include Ether, Solana, XRP, Dogecoin, Litecoin, and the USDC stablecoin. Thumzup CEO Credits US Crypto-Friendly Policies for New Diversified Strategy CEO Robert Steele attributed the move to favorable policy developments, noting that the US federal government‚Äôs shift toward clearer, more crypto-friendly regulations has encouraged Thumzup to adopt a diversified crypto strategy. ‚ÄúBy diversifying our portfolio of cryptocurrencies to gain wider exposure to the market as a whole, we believe Thumzup is optimally positioned to create significant value for TZUP shareholders,‚Äù Steele said. He emphasized the company‚Äôs commitment to staying ahead in what he called a ‚Äútransformative technology.‚Äù Founded in 2020 and based in Los Angeles, Thumzup operates a platform that rewards users with cash for promoting branded content on social media. The firm recently unveiled plans to broaden its treasury holdings, reflecting confidence in the growing role of cryptocurrencies in corporate finance. Donald Trump Jr., who owns about 350,000 shares valued at roughly $4 million, has been closely linked to the company. The disclosure followed a $6 million private placement arranged by Dominari Securities, whose parent company counts Trump Jr. and his brother Eric among its advisors. Thumzup‚Äôs Board of Directors has authorized the company to hold up to $250 million in cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Solana (SOL), XRP, Dogecoin (DOGE), Litecoin (LTC), and Stablecoin USDC.

It recorded a $2.2 million loss on just $151 in revenue in Q1. Still, its stock soared almost 75% over the prior four sessions before tumbling 17% by mid‚ÄëWednesday. In January, Thumzup made a notable pivot by announcing it would hold most of its liquid assets in Bitcoin. Since then, it has accumulated over $2 million worth of BTC. Now, the company plans to diversify further by adding six more coins, using funds raised in its latest round. Nearly 70 Trump Officials Hold Crypto As reported, nearly 70 nominees and officials in the Trump administration reportedly hold crypto or investments in blockchain companies , with holdings ranging from modest sums to over $120 million. The group includes Vice President JD Vance and seven Cabinet members or nominees, who collectively disclosed at least $2 million in crypto assets. President Donald Trump himself has declared a personal stake of at least $51 million in digital assets amid the administration‚Äôs deep financial ties to the industry. While some appointees have divested or plan to do so shortly after confirmation, the disclosures reveal a complex relationship between government officials and the crypto industry. Critics warn that this creates potential conflicts of interest and normalizes risky crypto investments among public servants.

2025-07-18T08:13:09,"While Bitcoin Stalls, Ethereum Rally Begins! But There's a Problem: ""A $6 Billion Options Earthquake Will Happen in BTC and ETH Today!""","While the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) continues to consolidate after the records it experienced last week, Ethereum (ETH) and altcoins are on the offensive. While ETH has surged by over 20% in the last seven days, altcoins like XRP, Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Stellar (XLM) have also seen major increases. As the bullish mood in the market continues, the expiration date for option contracts in the crypto market has come today, as it does every Friday. According to data for the third week of July, $4.95 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) and $880 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) options will expire on July 18 on the Deribit derivatives exchange. Accordingly, the Put/Call Ratio of BTC options is 0.78, the maximum loss point is $114,000 and the notional value is $4.95 billion. When we look at Ethereum, ETH options have a Put/Call Ratio of 1.04, a maximum loss point of $2,950, and a notional value of $880 million. The maximum pain point is the level at which the cryptocurrency price settles at a certain value as an option approaches its expiration date, resulting in significant losses for the largest number of option traders. At this point, significant volatility could be seen in Bitcoin's price following the $4.9 billion options expiration on July 18th. While the maximum pain point is at $114,000 for BTC and $2,950 for Ethereum, investors could push prices to this level through market manipulation, as market prices are above the maximum pain point. Corporates are Coming! Greeks.live analysts said that Ethereum has quickly taken over the bull market and market sentiment has shifted sharply to optimism. Analysts noted that the options market is still approaching FOMO, with institutional investors losing their composure and starting to enter the market. ‚ÄúEtheruem led the recovery of all altcoins, and the continued uptrend without a pullback greatly encouraged market participants and further raised their expectations. The rate of call option (bull bet) transactions has increased in the last two weeks, while institutions are also changing their positions.‚Äù *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-18T08:06:50,"This $0.03 DeFi token is 80% sold as BTC ETF inflows hit $2.72B‚Äî20x gains ahead?","Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is more than just a presale buzzword. It is building a decentralized lending protocol with a hybrid infrastructure that aims to fix many of the pain points that exist in traditional and DeFi borrowing. Instead of offering a rigid, one-size-fits-all experience, the project introduces a two-pronged lending model and offers full borrower flexibility‚Äîsomething DeFi users have been waiting for. As the world of passive crypto income grows more competitive, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs real innovation lies in how it handles capital. BTC inflow push Bitcoin (BTC) spot ETFs in the U.S. recorded a record-breaking $2.72 billion in net inflows over two days, with $1.17B on July 16 and $1.03B on July 17, 2025, marking the strongest two-day run since their January 2024 launch. BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Bitcoin (BTC) Trust (IBIT) led with $445.47M daily inflows, reaching $80B in assets under management, while Fidelity‚Äôs FBTC and ARK‚Äôs ARKB added $324.34M and $268.7M, respectively. Institutional demand outpaced new BTC issuance by 22:1, with 364K daily transactions and $61.43B in on-chain volume. BTC‚Äôs price held at $121,209, with technicals targeting $130K. The ETF surge boosts crypto sentiment, potentially lifting ETH (+5%), XRP (+3%), and SOL, as institutional capital flows in. Meme coins like SHIB may see less interest, but regulatory tailwinds from U.S. crypto-friendly policies could drive altcoin rallies if inflows persist. Unmatched borrower flexibility meets real yield At the core of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a borrowing engine that offers fully overcollateralized loans, open-ended repayment options, and flexible risk exposure. Borrowers don‚Äôt need to worry about strict due dates or rigid repayment plans. Everything is non-custodial and built around overcollateralization. This means users can lock in value without having to liquidate their long-term holdings, while still accessing immediate liquidity. For example, a user deposits 1,000 LINK (valued around $18,000) into the platform. With a loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of 60%, they can borrow $10,800 in USDT instantly, while maintaining full exposure to their LINK position. If LINK appreciates during the loan period, the user benefits from the price gain. Repayment can happen at any time, and once complete, the collateral is unlocked with no penalties. This kind of freedom, paired with smart risk parameters, sets a new standard in DeFi lending. Where other platforms separate flexibility and safety, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) brings both together through its dual lending structure. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model serves blue-chip assets like ETH, BTC, and DAI, enabling users to deposit and earn variable yields via smart contract pools. Meanwhile, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) system targets riskier or niche assets, giving users the power to negotiate interest rates, durations, and collateral terms for tokens like SHIB, DOGE, and PEPE. By allowing users to borrow against well-known tokens or negotiate custom loans on lesser-known assets, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is engineering a complete, flexible DeFi experience. This hybrid model doesn‚Äôt just widen the user base‚Äîit increases long-term engagement across multiple token classes. Presale momentum builds as 20x forecasts surface Phase 5 of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is nearly complete, with 80% of tokens already sold. The current price is still holding at $0.03‚Äîbut not for long. The next phase will raise the price to $0.035, a 20% gain for those who act now. So far, the protocol has raised $12.5 million from over 13,500 holders, many of whom joined during earlier stages. Buyers from Phase 1 entered at just $0.010 and are already sitting on a 300% paper gain. With a confirmed listing price of $0.06, even new Phase 5 participants are looking at a guaranteed 2X gain. But projections go much further. Market strategists who called DOT‚Äôs early run are now circling Mutuum Finance (MUTM) with estimates of up to 20x by 2026, driven by its real utility, not hype. That confidence is also being reinforced by security measures. The project has already undergone a full audit from CertiK, earning a 95/100 Token Scan Score and a 77.5 Skynet rating. A $50,000 Bug Bounty program is now active, covering all vulnerability tiers with rewards for those helping improve system resilience. This is a signal that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn‚Äôt just rushing to market‚Äîit‚Äôs building carefully for the long haul. To energize its growing community, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also hosting a $100,000 giveaway , adding extra incentive for long-term believers. All of this comes as the platform prepares for the release of its beta version, with core lending functionality and smart contract interactions set to go live around the time of exchange listings. This is not just another speculative token. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a real financial engine, with practical rewards, transparent mechanics, and sustainable architecture. As BTC‚Äôs ETF-driven rally shines a spotlight on crypto, investors are searching for the next big narrative. This is how early ETH felt in 2016. Only now, the entry point is still just $0.03.

2025-07-18T08:00:06,"2025 Crypto Thefts Spike: Stolen Funds Hit $2.7 Billion In H1‚Äì Report","As the market soars with bullish momentum, crypto theft has also seen a record-breaking performance during the first half of this year. A recent report revealed that stolen funds from services so far have surpassed the numbers from previous years. Related Reading: Crypto Relief: House Advances GENIUS, CLARITY, Anti-CBDC Bills After Narrow Vote Stolen Crypto Service Funds Hit $2B In 6 months On Thursday, Chainalysis shared its ‚Äú2025 Crypto Crime Mid-Year Update,‚Äù revealing that digital assets theft this year has been ‚Äúmore devastating‚Äù than the entirety of 2024, with over $2.7 billion worth of funds stolen from crypto services so far. The report noted that, by the end of June, more value had been stolen year-to-date (YTD) than during the same period in 2022, the previous worst year on record, suggesting that theft from crypto services could potentially increase another 60% by year‚Äôs end. 2025‚Äôs YTD activity shows a significantly steeper trajectory into the end of the first half than any previous year, with an alarming velocity and consistency. 2022 required 214 days to hit the $2 billion mark in value stolen from services, while 2025 reached comparable theft volumes in 142 days. Additionally, 2025 is 17.27% worse than 2022 during the same six-month period, while 2023 and 2024 saw more moderate and steady accumulation patterns. The surge in the cumulative trend value from crypto services theft ‚Äúpaints a stark picture of 2025‚Äôs escalating threat environment.‚Äù According to the report, ‚ÄúIf this trend continues, we could see 2025 end with more than $4.3 billion stolen from services alone.‚Äù However, it‚Äôs worth noting that the North Korean-linked $1.5 billion hack of Bybit accounts for most of the service losses. The massive breach, which is the largest crypto hack in history, signals a ‚Äúbroader pattern of North Korean cryptocurrency operations, which have become increasingly central to the regime‚Äôs sanctions evasion strategies.‚Äù Last year, known North Korean-related losses reached their highest number, with the value reaching $1.3 billion. Nonetheless, Bybit‚Äôs February hack surpassed it, making 2025 the worst year to date. Personal Wallet Attacks Surge Amid the shifting landscape, the report highlights that the surge in crypto thefts represents an immediate threat to participants. Notably, attackers are increasingly targeting individual users, as personal wallet incidents represent a growing share of total ecosystem theft. YTD, these compromises account for 23.35% of all stolen funds activities in 2025, with Bitcoin (BTC) theft accounting for a substantial share of stolen value. Chainalysis also found that the average loss from compromised personal BTC wallets has increased, suggesting a deliberate target on higher-value individual holdings. Moreover, the number of individual victims on non-Bitcoin and non-EVM chains, like Solana, is increasing. This suggests that Bitcoin holders experience larger losses in terms of value taken, despite being less likely to fall victim to targeted theft. Related Reading: SUI Eyes 140% Move As Price Reclaims $4 ‚Äì New ATH Imminent? Within the personal wallet incidents, a violent subsection has also seen a dramatic surge this year, showing a correlation with BTC price movements and suggesting opportunistic targeting during high-value periods. The forward-looking implication is that, if the value of native assets increases, the value compromised from personal wallets will also likely rise. Per the report, theft using physical violence or coercion against individuals, also known as ‚Äúwrench attacks,‚Äù could potentially hit twice the number of 2021, the next highest year on record. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $119,807, a 14.8% increase in the monthly timeframe.
