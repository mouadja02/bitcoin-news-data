2025-07-18T06:58:38,"XRP Price News: Analyst Eyes $7 After Ripple Breaks All-Time High","The post XRP Price News: Analyst Eyes $7 After Ripple Breaks All-Time High appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP has exploded past its previous all-time high of $3.40, reaching $3.65, a big move that was much-awaited by the community. Over the past week, XRP has surged more than 40%, breaking out of a large symmetrical triangle it had been forming since the start of the year. The breakout began around July 9, with strong momentum continuing into the following days. XRP smashed through the $3 resistance level, a price point that had acted as both support and resistance multiple times this year. Why $3 Was So Important According to analyst Lark Davis, the $3 level was important. In January and March, it had acted as a major barrier, first as support, then resistance. Now that XRP has broken above it, the big question is: can it stay there? If it does, analysts believe XRP could push toward $4.10 or even $4.50 based on technical projections. This target is based on the height of the triangle pattern that XRP just broke out of. All Eyes on the Retest Short term, what happens next will likely depend on how XRP behaves around the $3 mark. If the price retests $3 and holds, it could be a strong signal for another leg up. If it drops below that level again, XRP might trade sideways for a bit between $2.60 and $3. How High Can XRP Go This Year? A Fibonacci extension points to a possible price of $4.68. And if Bitcoin continues its own bullish trend toward $150K, XRP might even stretch to $5 or more this year. Options markets also show that traders are betting on more upside. There‚Äôs nearly a 20% chance XRP hits $4.50 by September, according to data from recent call options. Could we see $7 XRP by the end of the year if Bitcoin hits $200K? Davis says it‚Äôs possible, but it would require a huge push. A $10 XRP would mean a $590 billion market cap‚Äîwhich, while not impossible, is definitely a high bar.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-news-analyst-eyes-7-after-ripple-breaks-all-time-high/,"XRP|TRADING|BTC|MARKET","News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

2025-07-18T06:43:52,"The SEC is exploring an innovation exemption to promote asset tokenization.","The Securities and Exchange Commission Chair, Paul Atkins, said they are considering a regulatory exception to encourage tokenization. He told reporters, ‚ÄúStaff is considering what other changes may be appropriate to incentivize tokenization within our regulatory framework, including an innovation exception.‚Äù His remarks came shortly after the House passed the GENIUS Act‚Äîa key stablecoin bill‚Äîon Thursday. Atkins welcomed the move, emphasizing the SEC‚Äôs commitment to offering clearer guidance for the digital asset industry. The SEC chair claimed that assets will eventually be tokenized According to Atkins, they are exploring rule alterations to allow new trading methods and more targeted exemptions to support the development of a broader tokenized securities infrastructure. Several financial institutions have already shown interest in tokenizing major US stocks, and some have even hinted at developing tokenized products of private firms. While the future remains uncertain, Atkins argued that shifting assets onto blockchain rails is clearly inevitable, adding, ‚ÄúSo if it can be tokenized, it will be tokenized.‚Äù He also talked about the recently approved stablecoin bill, hailing it as a ‚Äúhistoric step‚Äù toward establishing the US as the global leader in crypto. He stated that he‚Äôs looking forward to seeing the market leverage the legislation provides while maintaining robust risk standards. Other backers of the bill have claimed it could enable quicker, lower-cost payments and bring credibility to the $265 billion stablecoin industry, which Citigroup analysts estimate could balloon to $3.7 trillion by 2030. Still, some Democrats like Senator Elizabeth Warren argue the legislation doesn‚Äôt go far enough in shielding consumers. House Democrats who opposed the bill cited concerns over President Trump‚Äôs involvement with crypto assets. According to Blomberg, Trump and his family have received $620 million from their crypto ventures, including the World Liberty Financial project, the TRUMP and MELANIA meme coins, and a 20% stake in American Bitcoin. The bill, however, had over 100 democrats vote in favor of it. Emilie Choi, Coinbase‚Äôs President, even described it as a giant milestone to have massive bipartisan support to advance stablecoins and market structure. The legislation stipulates that firms will hold equivalent dollar reserves in short-term government bonds or similar assets subject to state or federal oversight. It is set to reach Trump‚Äôs desk before the end of the week, where he is expected to sign it into law. Atkins had stated he would remove some of Gensler‚Äôs policies Paul Atkins has charted a distinctly different course on crypto from his predecessor, Gary Gensler, who critics say tried to govern the sector through enforcement. Atkins has previously expressed his intention to unwind key Gensler-era policies, including the rule allowing brokers to act as digital asset custodians. In May, he said the agency will make it easier to register crypto assets by clarifying securities rules. On custody, he said registrants should have more choices for managing and storing customer assets. He signaled the commission would reexamine and define the criteria for ‚Äúqualified custodians,‚Äù while also granting exemptions from current custody requirements to align with common practices in the industry. Atkins also said the framework governing special-purpose broker-dealers is due for an overhaul. He supports allowing registered firms to trade a broader mix of securities and non-securities assets on their platforms. He also emphasized that the agency should work on replacing the existing rules with ones that could last for years. Additionally, he claimed the SEC can proceed without waiting for Congress to approve laws. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

2025-07-18T06:37:28,"Crypto Market Cap Nears $4 Trillion as Bitcoin and Altcoins Surge Following Key US Legislation","The total crypto market cap is rapidly approaching the $4 trillion mark, propelled by strong gains in Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, and other major cryptocurrencies. Key Takeaways: The total crypto market cap has surged past $4 trillion, driven by gains in Bitcoin, Ether, and XRP. The US House passed three key crypto bills, boosting investor confidence and fueling the market rally. Trump‚Äôs family‚Äôs extensive crypto holdings raise concerns over conflicts of interest. The surge follows the US House of Representatives passing three significant crypto-related bills just before the August recess. According to CoinMarketCap , the crypto market cap peaked around $3.8 trillion, while TradingView put the figure closer to $3.9 trillion, both surpassing the previous record of $3.73 trillion set in December. Crypto Market Cap Surpasses $4 Trillion Milestone Meanwhile, CoinGecko has already reported that the market cap has crossed the $4 trillion milestone. Bitcoin regained its footing above $120,000 on Thursday, experiencing modest daily gains. Ether surged 8%, topping $3,600 for the first time since January, marking a 40% increase over the last two weeks. Meanwhile, XRP experienced a dramatic spike of nearly 20%, reaching a year-to-date high of $3.64 early Friday. JUST IN: The total crypto market cap has hit a new ATH of $4T. pic.twitter.com/gE8hRFegwz ‚Äî CoinGecko (@coingecko) July 18, 2025 Reaching a $4 trillion market cap would place cryptocurrencies just behind Nvidia, the world‚Äôs largest publicly listed company, which recently surpassed the same valuation. The recent legislative momentum in the US has boosted investor confidence, sparking fresh enthusiasm for digital assets across the board. On Thursday, the US House of Representatives passed three cryptocurrency-related bills, sending one directly to President Donald Trump and the other two to the Senate. These moves are part of the Trump administration‚Äôs broader effort to establish the US as the ‚Äúcrypto capital of the world‚Äù during what the president calls ‚Äúcrypto week .‚Äù The key bill heading to Trump, the GENIUS Act , introduces initial regulations and consumer protections for stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets like the US dollar. It passed the House with bipartisan support and aims to balance innovation with safeguarding consumers in the evolving payments landscape. Another bill, which passed by a narrower margin, seeks to clarify how different types of digital assets are regulated, distinguishing commodities, overseen by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, from securities, regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The legislation now moves to the Senate for further consideration. A third bill, passed narrowly, would prohibit the US from issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC), essentially banning government-backed digital cash. This bill also awaits Senate review. Trump Family‚Äôs Crypto Holdings Spark Conflict of Interest Concerns Trump‚Äôs family holds significant interests in crypto ventures, including World Liberty Financial, raising concerns over conflicts of interest and potential corruption. According to financial disclosures released last Friday, the former president pulled in $58 million from crypto ventures in 2024, primarily through WLFI token sales. That total trailed only his hospitality income and is expected to climb further in 2025 with an anticipated $390 million token sale and gains from his meme coin, launched in January. His involvement in Bitcoin mining, tokenized assets, and digital ETFs is raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest.

Crypto Market Outlook The crypto market rally has continued as the week comes to an end, with total capitalization hitting an all-time high of over $4 trillion. The top three digital assets are driving market momentum at the moment. Bitcoin has returned to $120,700 during the Friday morning Asian trading session as it erases weekly losses and moves to 2% from its all-time high. Ethereum is surging with an 8% daily gain to reach $3,600, its highest level since early January. The move has been primarily driven by huge ETF inflows and a new wave of Ethereum treasury companies. Meanwhile, XRP has hit an all-time high of $3.64 following a monumental 20% surge on the day.

2025-07-18T06:09:00,"Solana and Cardano Flash Buy Signals But Traders Are Fixated On Remittix‚Äôs 50x Potential","Crypto traders searching for the best crypto to buy now have watched Bitcoin cool off while altcoins quietly reset. Two heavyweights, Solana and Cardano, just flashed fresh buy signals that hint at a mid‚Äësummer rotation into ‚Äúhigh‚Äëgrowth crypto‚Äù plays. Yet the loudest chatter on X isn‚Äôt about Layer‚Äë1 breakouts; it‚Äôs about Remittix , a DeFi project many early movers see as the next big crypto launch thanks to its real‚Äëworld payment rails and live presale bonus. Here‚Äôs how the technical and fundamental picture stacks up for all three. Solana: Coiling for a Breakout A base near‚ÄØ$160 and rising on‚Äëchain volume have put Solana (SOL) back on radar for traders hunting the next 100x crypto. Chart watchers compare the current structure to Bitcoin‚Äôs coil before its spring squeeze, noting that a daily close above the twin moving‚Äëaverage cap around‚ÄØ$169 could ignite a run to the $190‚Äì$200 zone. Source: Tradingview The network continues to post the highest daily transactions of any major L1, proving that a low gas fee crypto can still dominate throughput even in choppy markets. If that breakout materializes, analysts eye the inverse head‚Äëand‚Äëshoulders target at‚ÄØ$219. Cardano: Regulatory Tailwinds in Waiting While SOL wrestles with resistance, Cardano (ADA) is catching speculative bids on the back of Washington‚Äôs proposed Clarity Act. Because more than 80‚ÄØ% of ADA is staked across thousands of pools, Cardano‚Äôs Ouroboros design ticks the ‚Äúsufficiently decentralized‚Äù box regulators crave. Should the bill pass, ADA could move from undervalued crypto project to regulatory darling, particularly for investors chasing yield through crypto staking. Source: Tradingview Why Remittix Is the Real Headliner Early‚Äëstage capital isn‚Äôt pouring into SOL or ADA right now, it‚Äôs flowing toward Remittix , a PayFi newcomer many are calling ‚ÄúXRP‚ÄØ2.0.‚Äù Reasons Remittix Is Gaining Traction: Cross‚ÄëBorder Utility: Direct crypto‚Äëto‚Äëbank transfers in 30+ countries Non‚ÄëCustodial & Private: No IP tracking; supports ETH, BTC, SOL, XRP with low gas fees Explosive Presale Stats: $16.3M+ raised so far in what reviewers label the best crypto presale‚ÄØ2025 Deflationary Tokenomics: Every transfer burns RTX, aligning scarcity with adoption Big Bonus Window: 50‚ÄØ% extra tokens still live for those who want to buy RTX token before listings. Analysts peg a 50x upside if Remittix captures even a sliver of the $19‚ÄØT remittance sector, an opportunity few other top crypto under‚ÄØ$1 can claim. Little wonder whales diversifying out of centralized exchanges have started flagging RTX as a new altcoin to watch in Q3. Exit Velocity: Charts vs. Cash Flow SOL and ADA both flash convincing buy signals: Solana on pure momentum, Cardano on potential legislative clarity. Yet the biggest buzz is swirling around Remittix , a PayFi rail that could convert meme‚Äëera enthusiasm into sustainable volume.

2025-07-18T06:00:06,"Bitcoin's Ancient Whale Selling Creates Perfect Accumulation Zone: Which Altcoins Will Boom in Price in Second Half of July","A large, long-time holder of Bitcoin has recently offloaded a significant amount, paving the way for potential market shifts. This move has created a prime opportunity for investors to accumulate assets. With the second half of July approaching, key altcoins are poised for growth. Discover which digital currencies are expected to surge and make strategic investment choices. Ethereum Market Surge Amid Mixed Long-Term Trends Over the last month, Ethereum recorded a solid gain of 17.34%, but the past six months indicated a decline of 13.95%. A recent weekly growth of 16.85% shows a rebound, signaling renewed investor interest after a correction period. Price fluctuations have been characterized by significant volatility and shifting market sentiment. Current performance suggests a market that reacts to both short-term catalysts and longer-term adjustments, reflecting a mix of recovered momentum and residual downward pressure from previous trends. The trading range currently sits between $2110.94 and $2870.47, with bulls momentarily in control due to the impressive weekly and monthly gains. Key support levels are at $1735.29 and $975.76, while the nearest resistance is at $3254.35, with a second resistance at $4013.88. Indicators like the Relative Strength Index near 69 and positive readings on the Awesome Oscillator indicate upward pressure. Trading strategies might involve entering near lower support levels and planning exits around resistance markers. Traders should monitor breakout signs and momentum shifts to manage risk effectively. Solana Price Action: Mixed Past Trends, Bullish Levels, and Tactful Entries During the past month, Solana has shown promising gains with a 10.77% increase as traders began to see renewed interest and short-term momentum, evidenced by a recent 7.69% rise in just one week. Over the more extended six-month period, price performance was less robust, dropping 22.14%. Such fluctuations underline an asset that experiences significant volatility, with past price behavior marked by a balance of positive weekly moves and a longer-term downward pressure. The charts indicate a technical journey where rapid short-term gains contrast with broader declines, setting the stage for potential recovery or further correction under shifting market conditions. Current pricing rests in a range between $131 and $173.35, with notable support at $107.89 and resistance at $191.79. Bulls appear to be making inroads as indicated by the rise to 7.69% in the last week and reinforced by technical measures like a Relative Strength Index near 57. However, the lack of a clear trend demands cautious optimism. Levels beyond, such as second resistance at $233.74 and second support at $65.94, shape a trading corridor. Solid support zones could provide buying opportunities, while approaching resistance levels may trigger profit booking. A balanced trading approach, looking for entries around support and exits near resistance, seems prudent in capturing potential gains in the current market. ADA Market Update: Weekly Surge Amid Long-Term Pullback Cardano recorded a 25.52% gain over the past week and a 16.29% increase in the last month. The last six months showed a decline of 32.47%, pointing to a challenging long-term correction. Prices have moved within a range of $0.48 to $0.70, highlighting both quick rebounds and sustained pressure. These price shifts reflect mixed market sentiments and trading dynamics in both short and long terms. At present, ADA trades within the $0.48 to $0.70 range, with key support at $0.38 and resistance at $0.83. A second resistance exists at $1.05, while deeper support lies around $0.163. Technical indicators show an RSI at 68.96 and a moving average recommendation leaning positive. Bulls dominate the weekly outlook, though the six-month decline signals caution. Traders might consider entries near support levels and aim for exits at resistance zones, as the market currently shows short-term strength but an unclear long-term trend. Conclusion The recent sale of Bitcoin by an ancient whale has created a prime opportunity for investors. ETH , SOL , and ADA are poised to benefit from this shift. This period could see significant price increases for these coins as they attract more interest. ETH remains strong due to its versatile platform, SOL is noted for its fast transactions, and ADA is gaining attention with its continuous development. Savvy investors might find this an ideal moment to consider these options. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.
