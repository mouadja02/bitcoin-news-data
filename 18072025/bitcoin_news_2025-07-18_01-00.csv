The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation For U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act also passed through the chamber in a 308-122 vote, with U.S. President Donald Trump slated to ratify the bill into law on Friday afternoon. Meanwhile, the Anti-CBDC Act narrowly advanced in a 219-210 vote, with just two Democrats voting yes on the Central Bank Digital Currency bill. Top Democrats Speak Out Against Key Digital Asset Bills News of each piece of crypto legislation‚Äôs success comes just two days after the House of Representatives‚Äô failed procedural vote that saw U.S. President Donald Trump hold Tuesday night talks with holdout lawmakers. ‚ÄúThis is our moment‚ÄîDigital Assets, GENIUS, Clarity,‚Äù Trump wrote in a July 15 Truth Social post. ‚ÄúIt is all part of Making America Great Again, BIGGER AND BETTER THAN EVER BEFORE.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe are leading the World, and will work hard with the Senate and the House to get even more legislation passed,‚Äù he added.

Saqib views El Salvador as a model for digital transformation in a resource-constrained environment. Other areas of collaboration include blockchain-based financial inclusion and the development of crypto policies for emerging economies. The agreement was signed in San Salvador during a meeting between Bilal bin Saqib, Chairman of the Pakistan Cryptocurrency Council (PCC) and Special Advisor to the Prime Minister on Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain, and Nayib Bukele, the President of El Salvador. In addition to advancing Bitcoin adoption, both countries agreed to collaborate on blockchain-based financial inclusion and the development of crypto policies for emerging economies. The Letter of Intent they signed outlines joint efforts to promote the public adoption of Bitcoin, expand financial inclusion, and foster supportive regulatory frameworks. The official discussions centered on leveraging El Salvador‚Äôs experience as a model for countries with limited resources but ambitious plans for digital transformation. Saqib emphasized the importance of seizing the moment, stating that emerging economies need not wait‚Äîthey can embrace blockchain and cryptotechnology now, guided by Bukele‚Äôs example. Crypto-Reserves: Digital Assets as Strategic State Reserves El Salvador, despite ongoing criticism from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), continues to actively accumulate Bitcoin. According to data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET , the country holds more than 6,240 BTC‚Äîworth approximately $740 million at the time of writing. Meanwhile, Pakistan is increasing its participation in the digital economy, bolstered by a $7 billion IMF loan program extending through 2027. Earlier in the summer, the PCC‚Äîworking with the Ministry of Finance‚Äîinitiated the allocation of 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity for Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence centers. However, the IMF raised concerns, particularly regarding preferential electricity rates for energy-intensive industries like Bitcoin mining. Saqib also discussed plans for establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve during The Bitcoin Conference in May 2025, reflecting Pakistan‚Äôs drive to secure a role in the future digital financial ecosystem. This partnership represents a pragmatic approach for emerging economies to harness the transformative potential of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, aiming for greater financial inclusion, innovation, and resilience amid a rapidly evolving global economy.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/10027/pakistan-and-el-salvador-sign-agreement-to-cooperate-on-bitcoin-adoption,"BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|MINING|FIAT|REGULATION","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

This is to make it easier for Americans to use Bitcoin and other cryptos on a day-to-day basis. Karoline Leavitt revealed that President Trump has already signaled support for the exemption and that the administration continues to support it. üö® The White House is now exploring a de minimis tax exemption for #Bitcoin to make crypto payments easier.

However, $600 is still on the higher side. Earlier this month, Senator Cynthia Lummis introduced legislation to reform US crypto taxation. She aims to exempt transactions under $300 and alter the tax implications for mined or staked crypto. Trump‚Äôs office to hold a signing ceremony The House passed three major crypto bills on Thursday, locking in a rare legislative win for the industry. In what‚Äôs now the biggest regulatory overhaul for crypto so far, lawmakers voted on the GENIUS Act, the CLARITY Act, and the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act. Leavitt added that the bill was very important to keeping Trump‚Äôs campaign promise. ‚ÄúThis piece of legislation is going to make America the crypto capital of the world, and that‚Äôs what the president promised,‚Äù she said. The GENIUS Act is mostly about regulating stablecoins. On the other hand, the CLARITY Act makes it clear that the SEC and CFTC will be responsible for different types of digital commodities, like Bitcoin. Meanwhile, some Democrats are still criticizing the bill for creating what they see as an overly weak regulatory framework that could pose long-term financial risks. They‚Äôve also raised concerns that the legislation opens the door for major corporations to issue their own private crypto tokens. ‚ÄúIf this bill passes, it will allow Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg to issue their own money. The bill still permits Big Tech companies and other conglomerates to issue their own private currencies,‚Äù said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. The Anti-CBDC Act says that the Federal Reserve can‚Äôt make a digital currency that is used by the whole country. The press secretary reiterated Trump‚Äôs opposition to a central bank digital currency (CBDC). She noted that he signed an executive order in January prohibiting its development. Leavitt said more crypto legislation will emerge from Capitol Hill. ‚ÄúThe administration supports Congress‚Äôs efforts to codify that executive order into law, and I believe there will be future pieces of legislation in regards to crypto that will be moving through Capitol Hill,‚Äù she said. Bitcoin mining remains an issue Senator Cynthia Lummis recently unveiled a digital asset tax reform draft that addresses these Bitcoin issues. The one that is yet to be addressed is that the IRS doesn‚Äôt see it as a product. The IRS usually only taxes people who make goods at the point of sale. However, Bitcoin miners are taxed by the IRS both when they mine Bitcoin and when they sell it. Bitcoin is the only thing that the IRS treats this way.

2025-07-17T22:12:17,"Why Bitcoin DeFi Protocols Are Seeing Impressive Growth As BTC Soars","The rising price of Bitcoin (BTC) is having a major impact on Bitcoin decentralized finance (DeFi) . Data from DefiLIama shows Bitcoin-based DeFi protocols‚Äô total value locked (TVL) went from $304.66 million on Jan 1, 2024, to a whopping $7.117 billion at the time of writing . Source: DefiLIama The recent surge in Bitcoin DeFi‚Äîoften referred to as BTCFi‚Äîis also likely due to institutional inflows, new protocol launches, liquid restaking, Bitcoin-backed loans, yield, and more. Institutions Seek a BTCFi Strategy Rena Shah, COO of Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem Trust Machines, told Cryptonews that institutions are finally waking up to the notion that Bitcoin is growing at a faster rate. As a result, the Bitcoin layer-2 ecosystem Stacks recently reported 5,000 sBTC (a 1:1 Bitcoin-backed asset that allows BTC DeFi) bridged in a matter of hours. sBTC Cap-3: Full. We reached the 5,000 sBTC cap in less than 2.5 hours. BTCFI is inevitable. pic.twitter.com/iz08KX4ltA ‚Äî stacks.btc (@Stacks) May 22, 2025 Shah added that the total loan value across the Stacks ecosystem has increased with Bitcoin price appreciation. As Bitcoin is recognized as a form of collateral, Shah believes that institutions will also begin to seek a BTCFi strategy, with many more to follow suit this year. ‚ÄúWhen everyday users see BTC hit new all-time highs, it creates an opportunity for a second step‚ÄîBitcoin DeFi,‚Äù Shah said. ‚ÄúThe builders who prepared for this moment will have the best opportunity to introduce new users to untapping the full potential of their Bitcoin.‚Äù Ben Sanders, chief growth officer at RootstockLabs, also believes this will be the case. Sanders told Cryptonews that in the coming months there will likely be more crypto exchanges and consumer finance apps integrating Bitcoin layers like Rootstock to give users access to BTCFi. ‚ÄúAs more institutions build Bitcoin stockpiles, it‚Äôs also inevitable that more of them will be looking at ways to put their BTC to work in truly Bitcoin-aligned blockchains like Rootstock,‚Äù Sanders stated. Stablecoins Enable Bitcoin DeFi To Surge Sanders further shared that the usage of Rootstock as Bitcoin‚Äôs DeFi layer surged in activity. ‚ÄúThis is reflected in Rootstock hitting new all-time highs in terms of Total Value Locked and active addresses interacting with the network,‚Äù he said. Major protocols like UST0, Solv, Midas, and LayerZero have also recently added support for Rootstock, further sparking the current BTCFi change. It‚Äôs go time. BTCFi, for real. https://t.co/MGazo28xme ‚Äî Rootstock (@rootstock_io) July 16, 2025 Rich Evans, managing director at crypto exchange CEX.IO, told Cryptonews that he believes one of the most promising developments is the introduction of stablecoins to Bitcoin DeFi. Reimagining Stablecoins on Bitcoin: The Future of DeFi @coinbase just released their quarterly report. One of the major findings? The continued staying power of stablecoins. Stablecoins broke out in 2024, with on-chain volumes surging to record highs. And while ETH has‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/GJqPF2ywnL ‚Äî Arch Network (@ArchNtwrk) February 24, 2025 ‚ÄúTether aimed to launch USDT on the Lightning Network via Taproot Assets, while UST0 was recently added to Rootstock,‚Äù Evans said. ‚ÄúStablecoins are indeed the backbone of DeFi activity across other chains. Bitcoin has long lacked a dominant stable asset, so stablecoin expansion could be a game-changer for Bitcoin DeFi.‚Äù This already appears to be the case. Sanders pointed out that two of the biggest use cases on Rootstock currently are Bitcoin borrowing and lending. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre seeing both retail users and institutions harnessing Rootstock to generate yield from their BTC holdings, or borrow stablecoins against them. I‚Äôve heard some incredible stories about people financing home renovations and businesses unlocking capital to expand into new markets,‚Äù he said. Willem Schro√©, CEO and co-founder of Bitcoin layer-2 Botanix Labs, told Cryptonews that Botanix is also experiencing steady growth due to these factors. ‚ÄúAs capital flows back into the ecosystem, we‚Äôre seeing a surge in interest around Bitcoin-native DeFi, particularly in lending, restaking, and generating yield on BTC,‚Äù Schro√© said. He added that Botanix has seen steady growth in new users and applications deploying to enable lending, decentralized exchange activity, and Bitcoin Yield. What‚Äôs Next For Bitcoin DeFi While BTCFi is on the rise, the sector may also soon be entering a new growth stage. According to Shah, cross-chain opportunity is the next big opportunity for Bitcoin DeFi. ‚ÄúEven if you have assets on another layer-1, Stacks is creating bridging opportunities so users can access the best in DeFi, while never having to sell their BTC,‚Äù she said. Evans also pointed out that technical innovations like BitVM2 and recently proposed BitVM3 are setting the stage for more flexible and scalable smart contract functionality on Bitcoin. ‚ÄúBitVM3, in particular, promises cheaper and more efficient Bitcoin-native bridges, which could reduce reliance on wrapped assets and enable more secure cross-chain activity. These tools could open the door to building Ethereum-style applications on Bitcoin, without compromising Bitcoin‚Äôs core principles,‚Äù he said. Challenges To Consider Although BTCFi has enormous potential, Evans explained that Bitcoin DeFi growth has still been relatively slow. ‚ÄúWhile Bitcoin‚Äôs price has reached a new all-time high‚Äîshowing roughly a 28% YTD increase‚ÄîBitcoin DeFi hasn‚Äôt kept the same pace, growing by only about 8% and still sitting below its previous peak,‚Äù he said. Given this, Evans noted that the recent Bitcoin price rally has sparked renewed interest and momentum, but so far, hasn‚Äôt translated into a major wave of activity in BTCFi. This may be due to a number of challenges. For instance, Schro√© believes that in order for Bitcoin DeFi to thrive, long-time holders need to reframe their relationship with the asset. ‚ÄúFor years, the dominant narrative was to ‚Äòbuy and hold.‚Äô That mindset worked in the early phases, but for Bitcoin to reach its full potential, it needs to be used. Yield opportunities, for example, can only exist if more BTC enters the ecosystem,‚Äù he said. Additionally, Schro√© remarked that security and education are still problematic when it comes to BTCFi. ‚ÄúMany Bitcoiners are cautious about using new tools, and this is rightfully so,‚Äù he stated. Echoing this, Sanders commented that security has become paramount in order for adoption to thrive. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs critical that Bitcoin treasury companies, infrastructure providers, custodians, and teams building decentralized protocols are aware of the risks and put the right measures and safeguards in place to protect their users moving forward,‚Äù he said.
