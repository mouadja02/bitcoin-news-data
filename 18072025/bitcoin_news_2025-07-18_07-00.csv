2025-07-18T04:08:48,"Matador Aims to Buy 6,000 BTC, Eyes Top 20 Spot by 2027","TL;DR Matador files CA$900M prospectus to fund its Bitcoin treasury strategy over the next two years. The company eyes a 6,000 BTC allocation and 1% of the total supply to become a major corporate Bitcoin holder. ‚ÄúFlywheel‚Äù strategy includes BTC accumulation, synthetic mining, and DeFi-linked revenue generation. Canadian Firm Plans Major Bitcoin Purchase Matador Technologies, a public company based in Canada, says it plans to grow its Bitcoin holdings to 6,000 BTC by 2027. The firm has also set a near-term goal of owning 1,000 BTC by 2026. The announcement marks a shift in pace for its crypto strategy. $MATA Board just green-lit our long-term #Bitcoin treasury strategy! 1,000 BTC by 2026‚ÄÉ|‚ÄÉ6,000 BTC by 2027 Goal: own ~1 % of Bitcoin‚Äôs fixed supply Current stash ‚âà 77.4 BTC BTC-denominated products ‚Üí more BTC on the balance sheet Matador Technologies ‚Äî shaping‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Matador Technologies (@buymatador) July 16, 2025 At present, Matador holds 77.4 BTC, which is worth roughly $9 million at today‚Äôs prices. Its long-term goal is to hold 1% of Bitcoin‚Äôs total supply. If reached, this would place the company among the top 20 corporate Bitcoin holders worldwide. CEO Deven Soni said the company is built around Bitcoin. ‚ÄúOur business is structured around Bitcoin as a core asset,‚Äù he stated. New Filing Supports Treasury Growth To support its plans, Matador filed a CA$900 million shelf prospectus on July 14. The filing will let the company raise funds over the next 25 months. Capital may come from equity offerings, convertible deals, asset sales, Bitcoin-backed loans, or new partnerships. Earlier this month, Matador received final approval from the TSX Venture Exchange to operate as a hybrid ‚Äútechnology/investment issuer.‚Äù This change gives the company more room to develop a Bitcoin-focused strategy while still working on blockchain-related projects. Strategy Focused on BTC Accumulation The company has described its approach as a ‚Äúcompounding flywheel‚Äù strategy. It includes growing its Bitcoin holdings, increasing BTC-per-share value, and using market volatility and synthetic mining to build yield. The plan also includes creating BTC-based revenue streams and working with DeFi and crypto infrastructure firms. Mark Moss, the company‚Äôs chief visionary officer, said the approach is aimed at long-term strength. ‚ÄúOur future plans to accumulate Bitcoin are designed to establish long-term stability on our balance sheet while reducing exposure to inflationary risk,‚Äù he said. Matador‚Äôs plans come during a rise in corporate Bitcoin ownership. Public and private companies now hold an estimated 1.15 million BTC. That total is around 6% of the current supply. Meanwhile, Strategy continues to lead with the largest BTC treasury, now worth more than $73 billion. Despite the announcement, Matador‚Äôs stock fell 4.65%, per Google Finance . Still, its shares remain up 37% since the beginning of the year.

2025-07-18T04:00:34,"Bitcoin Trades Above $117K as Whale Deposits Decline and Stablecoin Inflows Rise","Bitcoin continues to maintain upward momentum despite a recent pullback from its all-time high. Currently trading at $117,847, the asset has recorded nearly a 10% gain over the past week. The dip from peak levels, approximately a 4.1% decline, has not dampened broader investor sentiment, with several on-chain indicators suggesting renewed buying interest and reduced selling pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Demand Rebounds ‚Äì $0‚Äì$10K Transfer Volume Turns Positive Bitcoin Whale Withdrawals Decline, While Stablecoins Flow In In a recent analysis posted to CryptoQuant‚Äôs QuickTake platform, analyst Amr Taha shared insights pointing to a strategic change in behavior among key Bitcoin holders and investors. The report, titled ‚ÄúStablecoin Flood and Whale Retreat: Binance Moves Foreshadow Risk-On Sentiment‚Äù, outlined significant trends in whale activity and stablecoin flows that may support continued bullish momentum in the near term. Taha‚Äôs research highlighted a steep reduction in whale-level Bitcoin deposits on Binance. Over the past 30 days, these deposits have dropped from $6.75 billion to $4.5 billion, a $2.25 billion decline. Historically, large deposits from whales to centralized exchanges often signal an intention to sell, so the recent drop may imply a reduction in immediate sell-side pressure. This could stabilize Bitcoin‚Äôs price in the short term, especially if whales continue to hold or move assets to cold storage instead of preparing them for sale. At the same time, stablecoin flows have increased dramatically across major exchanges. On July 16, Binance and HTX saw combined stablecoin inflows exceeding $1.7 billion. Taha interpreted this as an indication that large entities, possibly institutions or whales, are preparing to accumulate digital assets. Large stablecoin deposits often precede significant buying activity, suggesting that the market could be gearing up for another leg higher, particularly if paired with reduced sell-side movements. Macroeconomic Developments and Miner Sentiment Add Context This on-chain activity is unfolding amid broader economic and political developments. Taha‚Äôs report also pointed to speculation around President Donald Trump‚Äôs comments during a private meeting, in which he reportedly considered replacing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Though later denied, the remark sparked reactions in traditional markets, including a weaker dollar and rising bond yields. These shifts signaled a rotation into risk assets, potentially benefiting crypto markets as investors reallocate capital in anticipation of a more accommodative monetary stance. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Thesis ‚ÄòWill Retire Your Bloodline,‚Äô Says Expert Separately, CryptoQuant analyst Arab Chain analyzed Bitcoin‚Äôs miner profitability using the Puell Multiple indicator. The data shows that while miners are currently making solid profits, the level has not reached historical peaks seen during prior market tops. In the 2017 and 2021 cycles, extreme miner profitability (indicated by Puell readings exceeding 2.0‚Äì3.0) often preceded sharp price corrections. At current levels, Arab Chain believes the market is not in a euphoric state, reducing the likelihood of imminent volatility due to miner-driven selloffs.
