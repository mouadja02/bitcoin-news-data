2025-07-18T20:55:18,"Crypto Futures Liquidation: Urgent Warning as $107 Million Vanishes in an Hour","BitcoinWorld Crypto Futures Liquidation: Urgent Warning as $107 Million Vanishes in an Hour The cryptocurrency market, a realm known for its exhilarating highs and stomach-churning lows, has once again delivered a stark reminder of its inherent volatility. In a dramatic turn of events that sent ripples across trading desks worldwide, a staggering $107 million worth of crypto futures contracts were liquidated in just the past hour . This isn’t an isolated incident; it’s part of a larger, more ominous trend, with nearly $989 million in futures liquidations recorded over the last 24 hours . For many, this represents a sudden and painful loss, a vivid illustration of the razor-edge risks associated with leveraged trading. But what exactly does this mean, and why are we seeing such a massive crypto futures liquidation event? What Just Happened? Decoding the Crypto Futures Liquidation Event Imagine a high-stakes game where players borrow money to amplify their bets. That’s essentially what happens in futures trading, especially with leverage. When a trader opens a futures position, they’re not buying or selling the actual asset (like Bitcoin or Ethereum) but rather a contract to buy or sell it at a predetermined price in the future. To increase potential profits, many traders use leverage, meaning they put down a small amount of their own capital (margin) and borrow the rest. A liquidation occurs when a trader’s margin balance falls below a certain threshold, typically due to adverse price movements against their position. Exchanges automatically close these positions to prevent further losses for both the trader and the exchange. The $107 million figure represents the total value of these forced closures in a very short timeframe, indicating a rapid and significant price swing that caught many leveraged traders off guard. The larger 24-hour figure of $989 million paints an even broader picture of the immense financial pressure experienced by the market. Think of it like this: You open a long position: You bet the price will go up. You use 10x leverage: For every $1 you put in, you control $10 worth of crypto. The price drops significantly: Your initial $1 (and the borrowed $9) is quickly eroded. Margin Call/Liquidation: If the price drops enough, your position is automatically closed by the exchange to protect the borrowed funds, and your initial capital is lost. This rapid succession of forced closures can create a domino effect, often referred to as a liquidation cascade , further exacerbating price declines and leading to even more liquidations. Why Does Crypto Market Volatility Lead to Such Events? The very nature of the cryptocurrency market—its crypto market volatility —is a double-edged sword. While it offers unparalleled opportunities for rapid gains, it also presents substantial risks. Unlike traditional markets, crypto markets operate 24/7, are less regulated, and are highly susceptible to sudden shifts in sentiment, news, and whale movements. This inherent unpredictability is a primary driver of large-scale liquidation events. Several factors contribute to this extreme volatility: Low Liquidity (for some assets): While major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have deep liquidity, many altcoins do not. Lower liquidity means that even relatively small buy or sell orders can cause significant price swings. News and Sentiment: Regulatory announcements, major hacks, celebrity endorsements, or even a single tweet can send prices soaring or plummeting within minutes. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic trends, interest rate changes, or global geopolitical events can also influence investor appetite for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Interconnectedness: The crypto market is highly interconnected. A price drop in Bitcoin can often drag down the entire market, triggering liquidations across various altcoin futures positions. When these factors combine, they can create the perfect storm for rapid price movements that quickly push leveraged positions past their liquidation points, leading to the kind of numbers we’ve just witnessed. Navigating the Perils of Leveraged Trading Leveraged trading, while offering the allure of magnified profits, significantly amplifies risk. It’s a powerful tool, but one that demands extreme caution and a deep understanding of its mechanics. For every dollar of profit you could potentially gain, you risk losing many more, often your entire initial investment, in a flash. Consider the stark difference between spot trading and leveraged futures trading: Feature Spot Trading Leveraged Futures Trading Ownership You own the underlying asset. You own a contract, not the asset. Risk Exposure Limited to your initial investment. Potentially much higher than initial investment (though most exchanges limit losses to margin). Profit/Loss Directly proportional to price movement. Magnified by the leverage ratio. Liquidation Risk None (unless selling under duress). High, if price moves against your position. The allure of leveraged trading is undeniable: turning a small capital base into significant gains. However, this appeal often overshadows the inherent dangers, particularly for inexperienced traders who might not fully grasp the concept of margin maintenance and liquidation prices. It’s crucial to approach leveraged positions with a robust risk management strategy, treating them as extremely high-risk ventures. Understanding Futures Trading Risks and Mitigation Beyond the general volatility, futures trading risks are specific and need careful consideration. The primary risk is, of course, liquidation, but there are others: Counterparty Risk: While exchanges mitigate this, there’s always a theoretical risk associated with the exchange itself. Funding Rates: In perpetual futures contracts, traders pay or receive funding rates periodically, which can eat into profits or increase losses, especially in volatile markets. Slippage: During periods of high volatility, your order might not be filled at the exact price you expect, leading to slippage and potentially worse entry/exit points. Over-leveraging: The biggest pitfall. Using excessively high leverage (e.g., 50x, 100x) means even a tiny price fluctuation can wipe out your entire margin. So, how can traders mitigate these risks? It’s not about avoiding futures trading entirely if you understand it, but about approaching it with discipline and a strong defensive strategy: Use Stop-Loss Orders: This is arguably the most critical tool. A stop-loss order automatically closes your position when the price reaches a predetermined level, limiting your potential losses. Manage Your Leverage: Resist the temptation of extremely high leverage. Start with lower leverage ratios (e.g., 2x-5x) until you are highly proficient. Understand Your Liquidation Price: Always know at what price your position will be liquidated. Most exchanges provide this information. Don’t Over-Allocate: Only trade with capital you can afford to lose. Never put a significant portion of your portfolio into highly leveraged positions. Monitor Market Conditions: Stay updated on news, market sentiment, and technical analysis. Avoid trading during periods of extreme uncertainty if you’re not an experienced professional. Effective risk management is not just a suggestion; it’s a necessity for survival in the fast-paced world of crypto futures. Preventing Liquidation Cascades: Strategies for Traders The concept of liquidation cascades is a terrifying reality for many traders. It’s a vicious cycle: a price drop triggers initial liquidations, which adds selling pressure, leading to further price drops, which in turn trigger more liquidations, and so on. This feedback loop can accelerate market downturns dramatically. While individual traders cannot prevent a market-wide cascade, they can certainly protect themselves from being caught in one. Here are strategies to consider: Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Spreading your investments across different assets and strategies can cushion the blow of a single asset’s downturn. Take Profits Regularly: Don’t be greedy. Secure profits when you have them, especially after significant price appreciation. Reinvesting a portion of profits can also help build a stronger capital base. Maintain Sufficient Margin: Always keep more margin than the minimum required. This provides a buffer against sudden price movements and gives you time to react if the market turns against you. Avoid Emotional Trading: Fear of missing out (FOMO) and fear of losing (FUD) are powerful emotions that can lead to irrational decisions. Stick to your trading plan and avoid impulsive trades based on market hype or panic. Utilize Cross Margin (Cautiously): Some platforms offer cross margin, where your entire portfolio acts as collateral. While this can prevent individual position liquidations, it also means a large loss can impact your entire account. Use with extreme caution and clear understanding. Educate Yourself Continuously: The crypto market evolves rapidly. Stay informed about new trading tools, market analysis techniques, and regulatory changes. By implementing these strategies, traders can build resilience against the inherent risks of the crypto market and minimize their exposure to liquidation events. The recent liquidation event highlights the volatile nature of crypto markets. Crypto Futures Liquidation: Urgent Warning as $107 Million Vanishes in an Hour The Human Element: Impact on Traders Beyond the numbers, these massive liquidation events have a profound human impact. For many, the funds lost represent significant savings, hard-earned capital, or even life-changing opportunities that evaporated in minutes. The emotional toll of such losses can be immense, leading to stress, anxiety, and burnout. It underscores the importance of mental resilience and a balanced approach to trading. It also highlights the need for robust investor protection mechanisms and clearer educational resources from exchanges and platforms. While the “buyer beware” principle is strong in crypto, the rapid growth of leveraged products necessitates a higher standard of care and transparency. Actionable Insights for Navigating Volatility So, what can you, as a participant or observer of this dynamic market, take away from this urgent warning? Prioritize Risk Management: This cannot be overstated. Understand your risk tolerance and implement strict stop-loss orders. Never risk more than you can afford to lose. Educate Yourself: Before diving into complex instruments like futures, spend ample time understanding how they work, the associated risks, and the strategies to manage them. Start Small: If you’re new to leveraged trading, begin with very small position sizes and low leverage. Gain experience before scaling up. Stay Informed, Not Obsessed: Keep up with market news and analysis, but avoid constant screen-watching, which can lead to emotional decisions. Consider Long-Term Investing: For many, a “buy and hold” strategy for fundamentally strong assets may be less stressful and potentially more rewarding than high-frequency leveraged trading. The recent liquidation figures serve as a powerful reminder that while the crypto market offers incredible opportunities, it also demands respect for its volatility and a disciplined approach to risk.

Summary: A Harsh Lesson in Market Dynamics The past hour’s staggering $107 million crypto futures liquidation , culminating in nearly a billion dollars over 24 hours, serves as a harsh but invaluable lesson in the unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. It underscores the amplified risks of leveraged trading and the critical importance of robust risk management strategies. While the allure of magnified profits is strong, the perils of crypto market volatility and futures trading risks are equally potent. Traders must approach these instruments with caution, discipline, and a clear understanding of how to prevent devastating liquidation cascades . Ultimately, success in this environment hinges not just on predicting price movements, but on skillfully navigating the inherent dangers of leveraged trading and protecting capital against rapid shifts. Stay safe, stay informed, and trade wisely. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is crypto futures liquidation? A1: Crypto futures liquidation is the forced closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange due to insufficient margin to cover potential losses. This happens when the market price moves significantly against the trader’s open position, and their initial collateral (margin) is no longer enough to maintain the trade. The exchange liquidates the position to prevent the trader from incurring further debt and to protect the borrowed funds. Q2: Why do large liquidation events occur in the crypto market? A2: Large liquidation events are primarily driven by the inherent high volatility of the crypto market. Sudden, sharp price movements (up or down) can quickly push many leveraged positions to their liquidation points. Factors contributing include major news events, macroeconomic shifts, significant whale activity, and the interconnectedness of various crypto assets, which can lead to a domino effect known as a liquidation cascade. Q3: How does leverage contribute to liquidations? A3: Leverage allows traders to open positions larger than their initial capital by borrowing funds from the exchange. While this can magnify profits, it also magnifies losses. With high leverage, even a small adverse price movement can quickly erode a trader’s margin, leading to a margin call or immediate liquidation because the borrowed funds are at risk. The higher the leverage, the smaller the price movement required to trigger a liquidation. Q4: What is a liquidation cascade? A4: A liquidation cascade is a chain reaction where initial liquidations trigger further price drops, which in turn trigger more liquidations. When a position is liquidated, the underlying assets are often sold off by the exchange, adding selling pressure to the market. This increased selling pressure can push prices down further, causing more leveraged positions to hit their liquidation thresholds, creating a rapid downward spiral. Q5: How can traders protect themselves from liquidation? A5: Traders can protect themselves by implementing robust risk management strategies. Key methods include using stop-loss orders to limit potential losses, using lower leverage ratios, maintaining sufficient margin in their accounts, diversifying their portfolios, and avoiding over-allocation of capital to single trades. Continuous education and avoiding emotional trading decisions are also crucial. Did this article help you understand the recent crypto market turmoil and the intricacies of futures liquidations?

2025-07-18T20:40:19,"Bitcoin Price Plunge: Urgent Market Update as BTC Dips Below $117,000","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Plunge: Urgent Market Update as BTC Dips Below $117,000 The cryptocurrency market is once again sending ripples of concern through its investor base as Bitcoin (BTC), the undisputed king of digital assets, experiences a significant price correction. Fresh reports from Bitcoin World market monitoring indicate that BTC has dipped below the critical $117,000 mark, currently trading at $116,960 on the Binance USDT market. This sudden descent has left many investors wondering about the immediate future and the broader implications for the crypto landscape. Understanding the Recent Bitcoin Price Drop : What Does it Mean? When Bitcoin, the benchmark cryptocurrency, experiences a sharp decline, it often triggers a ripple effect across the entire digital asset ecosystem. The recent Bitcoin price drop below $117,000 is a notable event, especially given the psychological significance of round numbers and key support levels in market psychology. For many, this price point represents a crucial test of investor conviction and market resilience. A fall below such a level can signal a shift in short-term sentiment from bullish to bearish, potentially inviting further sell-offs. Historically, Bitcoin has been characterized by its extreme price volatility, experiencing numerous significant corrections throughout its journey. These periods of decline, while unsettling for new investors, are not uncommon in the crypto space. They serve as a reminder that digital assets are high-risk, high-reward investments. Understanding the immediate implications involves recognizing that: Liquidation Risks: Traders using high leverage can face forced liquidations, exacerbating selling pressure. Market Sentiment Shift: A drop below key support often fuels fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) among retail investors. Opportunity for Accumulation: Long-term investors often view such dips as opportunities to ‘buy the dip’ and accumulate more assets at lower prices. This particular Bitcoin price drop compels us to look deeper into the underlying factors and broader market dynamics that might be at play. Deep Dive into BTC Market Analysis : What’s Driving the Downturn? To truly comprehend the recent price action, a thorough BTC market analysis is essential. Several factors, both internal to the crypto market and external macroeconomic forces, can contribute to such a significant downturn. Pinpointing a single cause is often challenging, as markets are complex systems influenced by a confluence of variables. However, we can explore potential catalysts: Macroeconomic Headwinds: Global economic concerns, such as persistent inflation, rising interest rates by central banks, and geopolitical instability, often lead investors to de-risk. Cryptocurrencies, being risk-on assets, are typically among the first to see outflows during such periods as investors seek safer havens. Regulatory Uncertainty: Ongoing discussions and potential new regulations in major economies can create an environment of caution. Ambiguous or potentially restrictive regulatory frameworks can deter institutional investment and lead to existing holders reducing their exposure. Whale Movements and Institutional Selling: Large holders, often referred to as ‘whales,’ can significantly influence market prices. A substantial sell-off by a few large entities or institutions taking profits after a period of gains can quickly overwhelm buying pressure, leading to rapid price declines. Technical Breakdowns: From a technical analysis perspective, a breach of key support levels (like $117,000 in this case) or the breakdown of established chart patterns (e.g., head and shoulders, rising wedges) can trigger automated sell orders and attract short sellers, accelerating the downtrend. Low Trading Volume and Liquidity: In some instances, a significant price movement can occur on relatively low trading volume, indicating that fewer participants are needed to move the market, making it more susceptible to large swings. Understanding these potential drivers is crucial for any investor looking to make informed decisions based on a comprehensive BTC market analysis . Navigating Cryptocurrency Volatility : Strategies for Investors The inherent nature of the digital asset space is defined by its cryptocurrency volatility . While this characteristic presents significant opportunities for rapid gains, it also carries substantial risks of equally rapid losses. For investors, developing a robust strategy to navigate these turbulent waters is paramount. Here are some key approaches: Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of investing a lump sum, DCA involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals (e.g., weekly or monthly), regardless of the asset’s price. This strategy averages out the purchase price over time, reducing the risk of buying at a market peak and capitalizing on dips. Setting Stop-Loss Orders: For active traders, a stop-loss order is a crucial risk management tool. It automatically sells an asset once it reaches a predetermined price, limiting potential losses during a sudden downturn. It helps to remove emotion from trading decisions. Diversification: While Bitcoin often leads the market, diversifying your portfolio across different cryptocurrencies and asset classes can mitigate risk. However, it’s important to remember that during extreme market downturns, correlation among crypto assets can increase. Long-Term Perspective: Many successful crypto investors adopt a long-term ‘HODL’ (hold on for dear life) strategy, focusing on Bitcoin’s long-term growth potential rather than short-term price fluctuations. They understand that short-term volatility is often noise in the grand scheme of a disruptive technology’s adoption. Emotional Discipline: Perhaps the most challenging aspect of navigating cryptocurrency volatility is managing emotions. Fear and greed can lead to impulsive decisions. Sticking to a predefined investment plan and avoiding panic selling or FOMO (fear of missing out) buying are critical for long-term success. By implementing these strategies, investors can better withstand the inevitable swings of the crypto market and protect their capital. Decoding Current Crypto Market Trends : Beyond Bitcoin While Bitcoin’s price action often dictates the overall sentiment, understanding broader crypto market trends requires looking beyond BTC itself. The performance of altcoins, the total market capitalization, and emerging narratives within the blockchain space all paint a more complete picture. When Bitcoin experiences a significant dip, altcoins typically follow suit, often with amplified movements. The ‘Bitcoin Dominance Index’ (BTC.D), which measures Bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to the total crypto market cap, becomes a key indicator during such times. A rising BTC.D during a downturn can suggest that capital is flowing out of altcoins and consolidating into Bitcoin, seen as a relatively safer asset within the crypto sphere. Conversely, a falling BTC.D might indicate that altcoins are holding up better or even outperforming Bitcoin, suggesting a broader market recovery or a shift in investor preference. Current crypto market trends also include the ongoing evolution of various sectors: Decentralized Finance (DeFi): DeFi protocols continue to innovate, offering lending, borrowing, and trading services without traditional intermediaries. Their resilience during downturns is often tested, highlighting the importance of robust tokenomics and sustainable yields. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs): The NFT market, while having cooled from its peak, still represents a significant trend in digital ownership and art. Its performance is often more correlated with overall market sentiment and discretionary spending. Layer 2 Solutions and Scalability: The focus on improving blockchain scalability (e.g., Ethereum’s Layer 2 rollups) remains a critical long-term trend, addressing fundamental challenges of network congestion and high transaction fees. Observing these broader trends provides context for Bitcoin’s movements and helps investors identify potential opportunities or risks across the diverse crypto landscape. Actionable Insights for Bitcoin Trading in Turbulent Times For those engaged in active Bitcoin trading , market downturns like the current one present both significant risks and potential rewards. Navigating these turbulent times requires discipline, a clear strategy, and an understanding of market psychology. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Prioritize Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Define your risk tolerance and stick to it. This includes setting appropriate position sizes and using stop-loss orders to protect your capital. Conduct Thorough Research (DYOR): Before making any trading decision, do your own research. Understand the fundamentals of Bitcoin, read market analyses, and stay updated on news that could impact prices. Avoid relying solely on social media hype. Avoid Emotional Decisions: Fear of missing out (FOMO) during rallies and panic selling during dips are common pitfalls. Stick to your trading plan and avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term price movements or widespread FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt). Consider Taking Profits: If you’ve accumulated significant gains, consider taking partial profits to de-risk your portfolio. This allows you to secure some returns and provides capital for future opportunities. Understand Market Cycles: Cryptocurrency markets move in cycles – bull markets are followed by bear markets, and vice-versa. Recognizing where we are in the cycle can help inform your trading decisions, whether it’s accumulating during a bear market or cautiously taking profits during a bull run. Utilize Technical Analysis Tools: Learn to use technical indicators and chart patterns to identify potential support and resistance levels, trend reversals, and entry/exit points. However, remember that technical analysis is not foolproof and should be used in conjunction with fundamental analysis. Effective Bitcoin trading in volatile conditions is about preparation and patience, not just predicting the next big move. Challenges and Opportunities in a Falling Market A significant Bitcoin price drop naturally brings its share of challenges. For short-term traders and those heavily leveraged, rapid declines can lead to substantial losses or even liquidations. The emotional toll of watching your portfolio value decrease can be immense, leading to irrational decisions like panic selling at the bottom. Moreover, sustained downturns can reduce liquidity across the market, making it harder to execute trades at desired prices. However, every challenge in the market also presents an opportunity. For long-term investors with a strong belief in Bitcoin’s future, price corrections are often seen as chances to ‘buy the dip’ and accumulate more assets at a discount. This strategy, known as dollar-cost averaging, can significantly improve average entry prices over time. Furthermore, downturns can shake out weaker projects and speculative froth, leaving stronger, more resilient projects poised for future growth. It’s also a period for reflection and portfolio rebalancing, allowing investors to shed underperforming assets and consolidate into high-conviction holdings. Conclusion: Navigating the Waves of Crypto Evolution The recent dip of Bitcoin below $117,000 serves as a stark reminder of the inherent cryptocurrency volatility that defines this asset class. While unsettling for many, it is a characteristic that experienced investors have learned to navigate. Our BTC market analysis suggests a confluence of factors, from macroeconomic pressures to specific market dynamics, contributing to the current sentiment. However, understanding these elements and applying disciplined Bitcoin trading strategies are crucial for resilience. The digital asset space continues its rapid evolution, and short-term price fluctuations are but ripples in a much larger wave of technological innovation and adoption. For those committed to the long-term vision of decentralized finance and digital assets, periods like these can offer valuable lessons and strategic opportunities. Staying informed about crypto market trends , managing risk effectively, and maintaining a clear perspective are the keys to thriving in this dynamic environment. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Why did Bitcoin fall below $117,000? Bitcoin’s fall below $117,000 is likely influenced by a combination of factors including broader macroeconomic concerns (like inflation and interest rate hikes), potential institutional profit-taking, regulatory uncertainties, and technical breakdowns on price charts that trigger automated selling. 2. Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? Whether it’s a good time to buy depends on your investment strategy and risk tolerance. For long-term investors, dips can present opportunities to ‘buy the dip’ and dollar-cost average. However, short-term volatility remains high, and prices could fall further. It’s crucial to do your own research and consider your financial situation. 3. How does Bitcoin’s price affect other cryptocurrencies? Bitcoin often acts as the market leader. When BTC experiences a significant price drop, altcoins (other cryptocurrencies) typically follow suit, often with amplified percentage losses. Conversely, a Bitcoin recovery usually leads to a broader market rebound. The Bitcoin Dominance Index can indicate how much capital is flowing into or out of altcoins relative to Bitcoin. 4. What are common risks in Bitcoin trading during a downturn? Key risks include rapid capital loss, forced liquidations for leveraged traders, increased emotional stress leading to impulsive decisions (like panic selling), and reduced market liquidity which can make it harder to exit positions at desired prices. 5. How can I protect my investments during crypto volatility? Strategies include dollar-cost averaging (DCA), setting stop-loss orders, diversifying your portfolio (though correlations increase during downturns), avoiding excessive leverage, and maintaining emotional discipline by sticking to a predefined investment plan. 6. What is the long-term outlook for Bitcoin after this drop? Despite short-term volatility, many analysts and investors remain bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term prospects, citing its finite supply, increasing institutional adoption, and growing utility as a decentralized digital asset. Price corrections are seen as part of its growth trajectory, offering consolidation before potential future rallies. Did you find this article insightful?

Crypto Expert Predicts Monster Altcoin Season Is Coming","With altcoin season potentially on the horizon, discussions have arisen about whether XRP can surpass Ethereum during this run. Crypto founder Arthur Hayes has made a case for ETH leading the way, while Dom Kwok, another crypto founder, believes XRP will pull a surprise. Can XRP Flip Ethereum As Altcoin Season Approaches In an X post , Arthur Hayes indicated that Ethereum will outperform XRP when the altcoin season begins. The BitMEX founder noted that Bitcoin has broken through its all-time high (ATH) on good volume and that ETH is following and will outperform. He further urged market participants to get ready for a “monster” altcoin season. Hayes added that the market is pricing in the likelihood that Donald Trump will again extend the tariffs deadline on August 1 . In another X post , the crypto founder again doubled down on Ethereum, leading the way above other altcoins, such as XRP. He declared that it is ETH season and expects the entire Ethereum ecosystem to thrive as a result. On the other hand, Dom Kwok has doubled down on his prediction that XRP will flip Ethereum. He noted that at the start of the year, he made this prediction and that hw now thinks it is going to happen even sooner than he originally predicted. Earlier in the year, the former Goldman Sachs analyst had highlighted two factors that could make this prediction come true. First, he stated that the RLUSD stablecoin could act as a tailwind by boosting XRP’s demand as the native token of the XRP Ledger, since RLUSD users will need it to transact. It is worth noting that Circle’s USDC has also since launched on the XRP Ledger, another development that could also boost the altcoin’s demand and see it outperform Ethereum. Kwok mentioned the potential XRP ETFs as the second tailwind that could cause XRP to flip Ethereum. He expects these funds to have a positive impact on the altcoin’s price, similar to the effect the Bitcoin ETFs had on the Bitcoin price. These XRP funds are expected to launch this year. Market expert Nate Geraci remarked that Ripple’s decision to drop its cross-appeal in the XRP lawsuit brings these funds one step closer to launch. The Most Simple Bull Case For XRP In another X post , Kwok outlined what he described as the simplest bull case for XRP that no one is talking about. He stated that retail is priced out of Bitcoin and Ethereum , so new retail investors will buy XRP instead of the first two largest cryptos by market cap. He noted that XRP is the third-largest crypto by market cap, yet trades at just around $3.20. The crypto founder believes this combination alone makes it the “most appealing” crypto to any new retail investor.

2025-07-18T20:10:13,"Strategy is guarding its massive $72 billion BTC stash with an air of secrecy","Bitcoin giant Strategy is guarding its massive $72 billion BTC stash with an air of secrecy. It has spread its holdings across multiple undisclosed custodians. So far, Coinbase has been confirmed as one of the safekeepers, and speculation points to Fidelity potentially holding some of its BTC. Two weeks ago, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong bragged on X that his company holds Bitcoin for eight of the ten publicly traded BTC holders. This strongly suggests that Coinbase is one of Strategy’s custodians. Our institutional team is crushing it – two awesome stats from our QBR this week: 1) 8 of the top 10 publicly traded companies with BTC on their balance sheet use Coinbase Prime. 2) There's $140B of crypto in US ETFs, and 81% of that is stored with Coinbase. We’re tracking > 50… — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) June 27, 2025 Strategy has long remained tight-lipped about its arrangements, only referencing “various custody” setups. The Bitcoin giant has carefully avoided naming a single firm responsible for safeguarding its immense digital fortune. Strategy’s most likely custodians What is known about Strategy Bitcoin custodians? They are simply “U.S.-based, institutional-grade custodians that have demonstrated records of regulatory compliance and information security, and all of our custodians are New York Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”)-regulated custodians.” That’s descriptive enough to whittle down the list of probable custodians. Only 9 of the 35 recipients who had NYDFS BitLicenses had limited purpose trust charters when Strategy sent its letter in the spring of 2023. BitGo, Coinbase, GMO-Z.com, Fidelity, Bakkt, Gemini, NYDIG, Paxos, and Standard Custody & Trust Company are among them. Unsurprisingly, Coinbase is the “principal market for Bitcoin” in MSTR filings. Coinbase was the first place where Strategy bought Bitcoin. Arkham Intelligence says it found $70,000 worth of the company’s BTC going to Fidelity in May. Other than Coinbase and Fidelity, the Bakkt Trust Company could also be on the list. Over the years, Bakkt, the company’s former parent, has been a lot of things. Bakkt bought Digital Asset Custody Company in 2019 and got a limited-purpose trust charter. Will Strategy face FTX’s fate? What Sam Bankman-Fried did with FTX has been a grand cautionary tale for investors. With Strategy’s custody secrecy, the entity could face the same devilish extinction. In another custody scam, the Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank bankruptcy, regulators and shareholders were kept in the dark about how much the company was affected. In that mix, Strategy had used some of its BTC as security for a loan from Silvergate. When asked about their roles in the bankruptcies and how that affected the company, Strategy (then MicroStrategy) told the SEC: Recent bankruptcies in the crypto industry and failures of certain financial institutions have not materially directly impacted the business or financial condition of MicroStrategy. We do not have any material exposure to companies in the crypto industry in our enterprise analytics business, and our customers include leading companies from a wide range of industries. Strategy (then MicroStrategy) The case of FTX could happen to Strategy under Saylor’s leadership – he has faced bankruptcy before. He once lost $6 billion in a day ($11 billion adjusted for inflation) as the dot-com bubble burst. That event was among the biggest single-day personal losses in human history until that point. The rest of the market remains hell bent on getting custody proof, but Micahel Saylor does not think so. He says it is a “bad idea” to publicly share “proof of reserves” or otherwise provide a detailed list of custodians, citing security concerns. However, Armstrong said that Strategy is a public company, trading under the ticker MSTR; therefore, some amount of disclosure is expected. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Through the strategic partnership, 21Shares announced that it has filed two Funds – the 21Shares FTSE Crypto 10 Index ETF and the 21Shares FTSE Crypto 10 ex-BTC Index ETF – with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The 21Shares FTSE Crypto 10 Index ETF intends to track a market-cap-weighted index of the top ten largest crypto assets globally. On the other hand, the 21Shares FTSE Crypto 10 ex-BTC Index ETF tracks a separate FTSE Russell index that excludes Bitcoin. “Investors are increasingly looking for diversified and easy-to-access ways to participate in the long-term growth of digital assets, and 21Shares aims to provide ETF structures to satisfy this demand, subject to regulatory approval,” Federico Brokate, Head of U.S. Business at 21Shares, noted . 21Shares Focuses on Crypto Tokenization Amid Regulatory Clarity The two crypto funds by 21Shares tap into tested regulations for securities and tokenization in the United States. For instance, the two funds will be structured under the 1940 Act funds, and offer investors a more familiar taxation. “The methodology and structure behind our digital asset pricing and indices were developed to give investors strategic allocation tools”, said Kristen Mierzwa, Head of Digital Assets at FTSE Russell. The tokenization of crypto assets, which is under the jurisdiction of the SEC, will play a crucial role in the mainstream adoption of digital assets by institutional investors.

The company noted that stablecoins offer low-cost and fast solutions, especially in cross-border transactions, and highlighted the future potential of these digital assets. The statement noted that the GENIUS Act, passed by the US Congress, provides the long-awaited legal framework for digital assets and instills confidence in the sector. This step, along with the European Union's Markets for Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation, contributes to a global regulatory momentum. Financial centers such as Hong Kong, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates are also taking a similar approach by introducing secure and transparent regulations for stablecoins. Related News: Analyst Who In 2013 Said “Buy Bitcoin Even For One Dollar” Announced His Latest Predictions For BTC Mastercard stated that these developments lay the foundations for a more harmonious and reliable environment in the industry, saying, “We support clear and strong regulations that foster innovation while enhancing trust.” Mastercard stated that stablecoins are already offering tangible benefits in the business world. The blog post noted that stablecoins accelerate cross-border business-to-business (B2B) payments, simplify peer-to-peer (P2P) money transfers, and provide more flexible payment options for content creators and employees. However, the company stated that technological advantages alone are not enough for these digital assets to enter the mainstream. It emphasized that they must be integrated with systems that are reliable, user-friendly, and ensure global compliance. In its blog post, Mastercard stated that it has been preparing for years to make stablecoins secure and scalable. The company argued that through initiatives like the Mastercard Multi-Token Network and Mastercard Crypto Credential, it has built a network that ensures regulatory compliance, resolves disputes, and fosters trust. *This is not investment advice.

Wilson tells Bloomberg Television in a new interview that Q3 could witness the moderate impact of tariffs. “We’ve been saying, the third quarter is probably the quarter of risk, where you’ll see some of this flow through to the cost of goods sold. I don’t think this is a massive correction. It’s a 5-7% correction. For some companies, it could be bigger, but this is the quarter of risk where the tariffs will start to hit, but the markets are already thinking about this as a temporary impact. And ’26 now, on an earnings growth standpoint, is looking better.” Wilson says he’s hoping the market pulls back for buy opportunities in an otherwise-promising market. “This is what the beginning of a new bull market looks like, right? It’s just explosive. It doesn’t let people in. The rate of change is accelerating beyond what you expected. I think the pullback’s going to be short and shallow, maybe there will be another surprise, another test of some kind, that will cause something more severe. But I really can’t see more than a 5 or 10% correction given what I see now in the landscape.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
