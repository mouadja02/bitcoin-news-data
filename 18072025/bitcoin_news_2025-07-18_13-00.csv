2025-07-18T10:58:30,"Ethereum Price Prediction: Will ETH Price Hit $20K in this Altcoin Season?","The post Ethereum Price Prediction: Will ETH Price Hit $20K in this Altcoin Season? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum (ETH) has finally started to show signs of life after spending much of the past year in a sluggish bearish phase. Over the last 12 months, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency grew by a mere 5.6%, frustrating investors who once saw it as a market leader. However, momentum has shifted in recent weeks. In the last 30 days, ETH has jumped by 44.2% to reach $3,640.83. In just the past 24 hours, the price surged 5.3%, indicating a strong short-term trend reversal and renewed investor confidence. Ethereum Price Gains Momentum: Key Metrics Ethereum’s recent performance further supports the bullish outlook. At the start of this month, ETH was priced at just $2,404.14. Since then, the asset has surged by over 50.58%. In the last 14 days alone, ETH has gained 42.3%, and in the past week, it rose by 21.7%. This rapid upward movement is signaling a potential breakout, especially if market conditions remain favorable. Analyst Predicts Ethereum Price Could Soar to $20,000 Fueling this renewed optimism is a bold forecast by well-known crypto chart analyst Colin Talks Crypto. In a recent post on X , Colin predicted that Ethereum could hit $15,000 to $20,000 in the upcoming crypto bull run. According to him, long-term chart trends support this target, showing a consistent upward trajectory that aligns with previous bull cycles. As of now, ETH is still trading 25.22% below its all-time high of $4,868.80, which was achieved on November 9, 2021, driven by the NFT frenzy, DeFi boom, and anticipation around the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. Colin’s projection suggests Ethereum could more than triple or even quadruple its ATH if the market rallies as expected. Ethereum vs Bitcoin: Which Will Perform Better in the Bull Market? Colin also compared Ethereum’s potential growth with that of Bitcoin. While Bitcoin’s all-time high was $69,000, the analyst expects BTC to climb 2x to 3x in the next bull market, suggesting a target range between $138,000 and $207,000 . .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Will the Crypto Bullrun Continue or Is a Weekend Pullback Coming? , Bitcoin’s market cap currently sits at over $2.37 trillion, significantly higher than Ethereum’s $436.8 billion. This market cap difference makes Ethereum more volatile, meaning it can rise faster during a bull run, but it may also fall harder when the market turns bearish. According to Colin, this volatility could allow ETH to outperform BTC in the near term, although investors should remain cautious about post-bull cycle corrections. What’s Next for Ethereum? As the market heats up and the crypto community begins positioning for the next major cycle, all eyes are on Ethereum’s price action. If Colin’s predictions play out, ETH could break all previous records and become one of the most profitable assets of the bull run. For now, traders and long-term holders alike are watching closely. A breakout past its previous ATH could be the first step toward a potential $20,000 Ethereum . .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Why is Ethereum going up now? ETH has surged over 50% this month due to renewed investor interest, institutional accumulation, and broader bullish market sentiment.

2025-07-18T10:57:09,"Ethereum Rises Above $3,600! Analysts Share Reasons for the Rise and Price Predictions! Here Are the Details","Ethereum (ETH) closed the week on a strong rally. Rapid liquidation of short positions and bullish sentiment in the options market pushed the price above $3,600 as of Friday. Ethereum Short Liquidations Push Price Above $3,600: Experts Call It a Structural Transformation ETH, which has gained over 20 percent on a weekly basis, could test the $4,000 level by the July 25 futures options expiry, according to analysts. Dr. Sean Dawson, research director at onchain options platform Derive.xyz, described this upward move as a “structural regime shift,” saying, “Investors are aggressively positioning for a rapid rise to $4,000.” According to Coinglass data, approximately $136 million worth of ETH short positions were liquidated in the last 24 hours, causing an upward price squeeze. Approximately 25% of ETH options traded on the Derive platform since Wednesday are focused on $3,000-$4,000 call options due July 25. Eight percent of open positions for the same period are positioned at $4,000. Dawson estimates a 14% probability of ETH closing above $4,000 by the end of July and a 27% probability of it closing above $5,000 by the end of 2025. Bitcoin is also participating in this rally, but this rally belongs to Ethereum. The technical landscape, options flows, and liquidations signal a structural shift in market positioning. Regulatory developments in the US also contributed to the overall market rally. The total crypto market capitalization surpassed $4 trillion for the first time. This development was bolstered by the bipartisan GENIUS Act, which was sent to the president for signature, and the Senate's introduction of the Clarity Act. These regulations are widely seen by investors as paving the way for clearer cryptocurrency regulations in the US. Wall Street's appetite for crypto funds has also strengthened. BRN senior analyst Valentin Fournier noted that Ethereum led the way. According to the data, there were net inflows of $602 million into Ether spot ETFs and $523 million into Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin Consolidates, New Highs on the Horizon Bitcoin remained sideways below $120,000 during this period. According to Glassnode data, BTC has reached a point that has historically acted as resistance, rising one standard deviation above its short-term investor cost average. However, technical analysis suggests that the next resistance level is around $136,000, suggesting that the upside potential may continue. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-18T10:55:18,"Coinsilium Group’s Strategic Bitcoin Accumulation: Unlocking Future Value with 112 BTC Holdings","BitcoinWorld Coinsilium Group’s Strategic Bitcoin Accumulation: Unlocking Future Value with 112 BTC Holdings In a significant move that underscores its unwavering commitment to the digital asset space, Coinsilium Group has announced a fresh acquisition of 10.25 BTC. This latest purchase elevates their total Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 112 BTC, signaling a robust and confident stance in the evolving cryptocurrency market. For those closely watching corporate movements in the blockchain sector, this development from Coinsilium Group Forza! offers compelling insights into strategic treasury management and the long-term potential seen in Bitcoin. Coinsilium Group’s Bold Move: Why More Bitcoin? Coinsilium Group is not just another company dabbling in crypto; it’s a well-established blockchain venture builder and investor with a deep understanding of the industry’s intricacies. Their decision to further accumulate Bitcoin is far from impulsive. It reflects a calculated strategy rooted in several key beliefs: Bitcoin as a Store of Value: In an era of increasing inflation concerns and economic uncertainty, Bitcoin has emerged as a compelling digital alternative to traditional safe-haven assets like gold. Its decentralized nature and finite supply of 21 million coins make it an attractive hedge against fiat currency devaluation. Long-Term Growth Potential: Despite its notorious volatility, Bitcoin has demonstrated remarkable long-term growth. Companies like Coinsilium Group are positioning themselves to capitalize on this potential appreciation, viewing BTC as a strategic asset for future capital gains. Alignment with Core Business: As a blockchain-focused entity, holding a significant amount of the premier cryptocurrency strengthens Coinsilium’s position and credibility within the digital asset ecosystem. It’s a tangible demonstration of their belief in the very technology they help build and invest in. The company’s mantra, ‘Forza!’, truly encapsulates this forward-driving momentum and confidence in their strategic decisions within the dynamic world of digital assets. Understanding the Significance of Bitcoin Holdings in Corporate Strategy The trend of corporations adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets has gained considerable traction over the past few years. What drives this shift, and why is Coinsilium Group’s substantial Bitcoin holdings noteworthy? Traditionally, corporate treasuries primarily held cash, short-term government bonds, or other low-risk, low-yield assets. However, with interest rates near zero and concerns about currency debasement, many forward-thinking companies are exploring alternatives. Bitcoin offers: Diversification: Bitcoin can provide a degree of diversification away from traditional financial assets, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Inflation Hedge: Its fixed supply and growing adoption make it a potential hedge against inflation, preserving purchasing power over time. Investor Confidence: For some investors, a company’s strategic allocation to Bitcoin signals innovation, adaptability, and a belief in the future of digital finance. While companies like MicroStrategy have made headlines for their aggressive Bitcoin accumulation, Coinsilium’s consistent and growing BTC position, albeit on a different scale, solidifies its commitment to this emerging asset class within its own operational and investment framework. The Impact of Strategic BTC Acquisition on Portfolio Diversification Every strategic BTC acquisition , like Coinsilium’s recent 10.25 BTC addition, plays a crucial role in shaping a company’s overall financial health and future prospects. For a company like Coinsilium, which is deeply embedded in the blockchain space, this move enhances its portfolio diversification in several ways: Exposure to a Leading Asset: Bitcoin is the undisputed leader in the cryptocurrency market. Holding it provides direct exposure to the performance of the broader crypto market, often seen as a bellwether for the entire digital asset industry. Enhanced Liquidity: Bitcoin is one of the most liquid cryptocurrencies, allowing for relatively easy entry and exit from positions, which is important for treasury management. Strategic Reserve: Beyond being an investment, Bitcoin can serve as a strategic reserve, offering flexibility in funding future ventures or navigating market fluctuations within the crypto ecosystem itself. This approach highlights a sophisticated understanding of how digital assets can be integrated into a comprehensive financial strategy, moving beyond speculative trading to long-term value creation. Navigating the Future: Coinsilium’s Crypto Investment Strategy Coinsilium Group’s recent actions provide a clear window into their broader crypto investment strategy . It’s a strategy built on conviction, long-term vision, and an active participation in the blockchain economy. Their approach can be characterized by: Consistent Accumulation: Rather than large, one-off purchases, Coinsilium has shown a pattern of incremental accumulation, suggesting a dollar-cost averaging approach to mitigate volatility risks. Focus on Core Assets: While they invest in various blockchain ventures, their direct holdings appear concentrated on Bitcoin, indicating a belief in its foundational role within the digital economy. Leveraging Industry Expertise: As a company deeply involved in blockchain development and investment, Coinsilium is uniquely positioned to understand market trends and make informed decisions about their digital asset allocations. This strategy positions Coinsilium not just as a holder of digital assets, but as an active participant shaping the future of decentralized finance and technology. What Does This Mean for Your Digital Asset Portfolio? Coinsilium Group’s actions can serve as a valuable case study for individual investors considering their own digital asset portfolio . While corporate strategies differ from personal ones, some key takeaways are universally applicable: Long-Term Perspective: Companies holding Bitcoin for the long term often look beyond daily price fluctuations. Adopting a similar mindset can help individual investors weather market volatility. Diversification is Key: While Bitcoin is a strong asset, a balanced portfolio might include other cryptocurrencies, traditional assets, and a clear understanding of risk tolerance. Research and Due Diligence: Before investing, understand the asset, its technology, and its market dynamics. Learn from companies that are making calculated moves based on deep industry knowledge. The growth in corporate Bitcoin adoption validates the asset class, providing a stronger foundation for the entire ecosystem. It suggests that digital assets are increasingly being viewed as legitimate, valuable components of a diversified investment strategy. Conclusion: Coinsilium’s Steadfast Commitment to Bitcoin’s Future Coinsilium Group’s latest acquisition of 10.25 BTC, bringing their total holdings to 112 BTC, is more than just a financial transaction. It’s a powerful statement of confidence in Bitcoin’s enduring value and its role in the future of finance. As a prominent player in the blockchain venture space, Coinsilium continues to demonstrate a forward-thinking approach to treasury management and digital asset strategy. Their consistent accumulation of Bitcoin underscores a belief in its potential as a store of value, an inflation hedge, and a core component of a resilient digital asset portfolio. This move not only strengthens Coinsilium’s own financial position but also sends a clear signal to the broader market about the increasing institutional acceptance and strategic importance of Bitcoin.

How does Bitcoin acquisition impact a company’s financial health?

2025-07-18T10:49:02,"Will the Crypto Bullrun Continue or Is a Weekend Pullback Coming?","The post Will the Crypto Bullrun Continue or Is a Weekend Pullback Coming? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency market continues its bullish expansion, this time influenced by strong institutional inflows and regulatory clarity. The total market cap has breached $3.91 trillion, marking a significant technical breakout. Talking about sentiments, the Fear & Greed Index sits at 71, indicating rising optimism yet possibly inclining toward overheated conditions. That being said, as Bitcoin consolidates and altcoins catch the trend, the key question remains: will the crypto bullrun continue, or is a weekend pullback brewing? Join me as I take you through the specifics and an overview of what could be in store. Total Crypto Market Cap: Cooling Signs Within a Strong Trend? The 4-hour chart of the total crypto market cap I’ve shared reveals an uptrend, but surfacing short-term exhaustion. The market is currently pressing against the upper Bollinger Band near ~$3.88T, indicating a stretched move that often comes before short-term corrections. It is evident that the market is approaching the overbought territory, with the RSI at 68.70. That being said, if a pullback occurs, the mid-Bollinger Band at ~$3.73T and the lower band near $3.58T will serve as strong support zones. Despite this short-term caution, the macro trend remains fairly bullish. The breakout above $3.9T is a strong signal that the business is ready to challenge higher valuations. This is especially if the key levels hold firm ground over the weekend. Buy-the-Dip Playbook Still in Motion? Popular analyst Michael van de Poppe highlights that when “Bitcoin consolidates, altcoins start firing off”. He believes that we’ll have some harsh corrections, and those would be great buy-the-dip opportunities. This aligns with what’s playing out now, as BTC is pausing below $120k, altcoins are showing relative strength. The breakout in total crypto market cap confirms broader strength, yet caution remains warranted given the RSI and overextension. With weekend volatility expected, having an entry plan around $112k for BTC and mid-band support on the TOTAL chart would offer a strategic edge. FAQs Is the crypto bullrun over or is this just a pullback? It’s a breather. Most signals suggest continuation after a possible short-term cooldown. Has the altseason started? Not quite, the Altcoin season index is neutral at 49/100.

2025-07-18T10:40:18,"Bitcoin Dormancy: Unveiling the Astonishing Truth of Lost BTC Supply","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Dormancy: Unveiling the Astonishing Truth of Lost BTC Supply Imagine a significant portion of the world’s most valuable digital asset, Bitcoin, simply sitting untouched for years, like ancient treasure buried deep. This isn’t just a fantasy; it’s a profound reality highlighted by recent data. Sentora, formerly known as IntoTheBlock, recently unveiled a startling statistic on X: over 30% of all Bitcoin (BTC) has remained dormant for five years or more. Even more astonishing, they estimate that a considerable 7.5% of the total supply is likely permanently lost. These figures paint a vivid picture of the enduring nature of Bitcoin and the long-term conviction of its holders, while also raising intriguing questions about its true circulating supply and future value. The Silent Majority: Understanding Bitcoin Dormancy What does it mean for Bitcoin to be “dormant”? In simple terms, it refers to BTC that has not moved from its wallet address for a specified period. Sentora’s revelation that over 30% of Bitcoin has been inactive for half a decade or more is a powerful indicator of several key trends within the crypto ecosystem. This isn’t just about forgotten wallets; it speaks volumes about the “HODL” philosophy – a term born from a misspelling of “hold” during a moment of market volatility, now a mantra for long-term investors. Deep HODLers: Many early adopters and conviction-driven investors purchased Bitcoin years ago and have simply held onto it, weathering market storms with unwavering belief in its long-term potential. They see Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a store of value, a digital gold, or even a future global reserve currency. Institutional Cold Storage: As institutional adoption grows, large entities, funds, and corporations acquire significant amounts of BTC and store it in highly secure, often offline (cold) wallets. These holdings are typically not intended for frequent trading, contributing to the dormant supply. Forgotten Wallets/Keys: Sadly, a portion of this dormant supply undoubtedly belongs to individuals who have lost access to their private keys, forgotten passwords, or whose hardware wallets have failed without backups. This leads us to the even more permanent category of lost Bitcoin. The sheer volume of Bitcoin dormancy underscores a unique characteristic of this asset: its ability to attract and retain a dedicated base of long-term holders, differentiating it from more volatile, frequently traded digital assets. The Unseen Impact: Exploring the Phenomenon of Lost Bitcoin While dormancy suggests inactivity, “lost” Bitcoin implies a permanent inability to access those coins. Sentora’s estimate of over 7.5% of the total BTC supply being permanently lost is a sobering reminder of the unforgiving nature of self-custody in the digital realm. This figure, though an estimate, has significant implications for the actual circulating supply of Bitcoin. How does Bitcoin get lost? The reasons are varied and often tragic: Forgotten Private Keys: The most common reason. Bitcoin’s security relies on a unique private key. If this key is lost, forgotten, or destroyed without a backup, the associated BTC becomes irretrievable. Early miners or casual users who acquired small amounts of BTC years ago might not have realized the importance of secure key management. Hardware Wallet Failures: Physical devices holding private keys can malfunction, be damaged, or simply disappear. Without a properly recorded seed phrase, the coins are lost. Accidental Transfers: Sending BTC to an incorrect or non-existent address can lead to permanent loss, as transactions on the blockchain are irreversible. The “Satoshi” Wallets: A portion of the lost Bitcoin is believed to be held in the very first wallets mined by Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. These coins have never moved, and it’s widely speculated they will remain untouched, effectively lost to the active supply. The phenomenon of lost Bitcoin effectively reduces the true maximum circulating supply, making the existing accessible supply even scarcer. This has profound implications for its long-term valuation and market dynamics. Why Does BTC Supply Matter? Scarcity and Value Bitcoin’s fundamental design is rooted in scarcity. Unlike fiat currencies that can be printed indefinitely, Bitcoin has a hard cap of 21 million coins. This fixed supply, combined with its programmatic issuance schedule (halving events), is a core tenet of its value proposition. When we factor in dormant and lost coins, the effective circulating BTC supply available for active trading and use is significantly lower than the total mined supply. Consider these points: Deflationary Pressure: A reduced effective supply, coupled with increasing demand, inherently creates deflationary pressure, potentially driving up the price of the remaining active coins. Digital Gold Narrative: The scarcity aspect strengthens Bitcoin’s narrative as “digital gold.” Just like physical gold is rare and difficult to extract, Bitcoin’s limited and diminishing accessible supply enhances its appeal as a store of value. Halving Events: Every four years, the reward for mining new Bitcoin is halved, further reducing the rate at which new coins enter circulation. When combined with lost and dormant coins, this creates an even tighter supply squeeze over time. Understanding the true available BTC supply is crucial for investors and analysts alike. It shifts the perspective from a simple 21 million cap to a much lower, actively traded amount, intensifying its scarcity premium. Decoding the Sentora Report : What it Tells Us About Holder Behavior The recent Sentora report (formerly from IntoTheBlock) isn’t just about numbers; it’s a window into the psychology and behavior of Bitcoin holders. The fact that such a large percentage of BTC remains unmoved for half a decade or more highlights a strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term potential, transcending short-term market fluctuations. Key takeaways from this report on holder behavior: High Conviction: A significant portion of Bitcoin holders are not day traders or short-term speculators. They are long-term investors with high conviction in Bitcoin’s future. This “diamond hands” mentality provides a strong foundation for the asset, reducing selling pressure during downturns. Accumulation Phase: Periods of dormancy often follow accumulation phases, where investors buy BTC during dips and then hold onto it. The five-year threshold suggests many of these coins were acquired during or before the 2017 bull run, or even earlier. Maturity of the Asset: The growing percentage of dormant coins indicates a maturing asset class. As Bitcoin gains mainstream acceptance, more long-term capital flows in, seeking stable, generational wealth preservation rather than quick gains. The insights from the Sentora report provide a more nuanced understanding of Bitcoin’s market structure, emphasizing the role of long-term holders in its price stability and growth trajectory. The Future of Bitcoin Scarcity : What This Means for Investors The combined effects of dormancy, lost coins, and the programmed halving events paint a compelling picture of increasing Bitcoin scarcity . For investors, this has several profound implications: Potential for Price Appreciation: Basic economics dictates that if demand remains constant or increases while supply diminishes, prices tend to rise. The ever-shrinking active supply of Bitcoin due to dormancy and loss, coupled with its fixed maximum supply and halving schedule, creates a powerful long-term bullish fundamental. Long-Term vs. Short-Term Strategy: The data strongly supports a long-term investment strategy for Bitcoin. While short-term trading can be profitable, the underlying fundamentals of scarcity and HODL behavior suggest that patience and holding could yield significant returns over extended periods. Understanding Market Dynamics: Investors need to look beyond just the total mined supply. The effective circulating supply is what truly influences market dynamics. This nuanced understanding can help in making more informed investment decisions. Security is Paramount: The significant percentage of lost Bitcoin serves as a stark warning. For anyone holding BTC, robust security practices – including secure private key management, multiple backups of seed phrases, and awareness of phishing scams – are not optional but essential. As the digital economy evolves, the unique attributes of Bitcoin scarcity will likely become even more pronounced, positioning it as a premier asset for long-term wealth preservation and growth. The latest data from Sentora offers a fascinating glimpse into the core strength and long-term trajectory of Bitcoin. With over 30% of its supply dormant for half a decade and an estimated 7.5% permanently lost, Bitcoin’s true circulating supply is far tighter than many realize. This extreme scarcity, driven by unwavering HODL conviction and accidental loss, reinforces Bitcoin’s position as a deflationary asset with immense long-term potential. It highlights the profound belief in its value as a digital store of wealth and underscores the critical importance of secure self-custody. As Bitcoin continues to mature, these supply dynamics will play an increasingly vital role in shaping its future valuation and its role in the global financial landscape.

2025-07-18T10:30:05,"Bitcoin Dominance is Losing Momentum FAST - Here's The Top 3 Must-Have Altcoins For Double Digit Gains in Coming Months","Bitcoin's stronghold on the market is showing signs of weakening rapidly. As the spotlight shifts, attention turns to altcoins poised for impressive growth. Discover which digital currencies are predicted to make significant gains in the upcoming months. Explore the top three altcoins that could offer double-digit returns amidst the changing market landscape. Stellar Price Surge Amid Six-Month Slump Over the last month, Stellar experienced a strong uplift with prices gaining nearly 80%. A weekly surge of about 62.65% underscores recent momentum despite a modest six-month decline of roughly 3.6%. Price movements have been volatile, swinging sharply upward before settling into a narrower range. This activity highlights rapid gains over the short term paired with a longer-term pullback, reflecting traders’ cautious approach in the broader market environment. The current price hovers in a band between $0.21 and $0.28 with clear technical levels in sight. Immediate resistance stands around $0.31 while a second hurdle emerges near $0.38. On the downside, support is firmly positioned near $0.18 with a secondary level noted around $0.11. Bulls have taken charge in the last month, but the RSI over 84 suggests overbought conditions. Strategic plays may involve building positions near support while taking profits as resistance is approached. Cautious risk management will help traders navigate the market dynamics. Algorand's Recent Market Shifts and Price Dynamics Algorand experienced a dramatic shift over the past month and half-year. In the six-month period, the coin saw a decline of 37.27% before rebounding with a notable one-month increase of 68.67%. The short-term momentum has been impressive, with a one-week gain of 53.26% reflecting robust buying interest. These movements indicate that the coin has faced periods of weakness followed by rapid recovery, highlighting its volatile performance. The current price sits between $0.16 and $0.21, with nearest resistance at $0.24 and a second resistance level at $0.29. Key support is observed at $0.13, with a secondary support at $0.07. Technical indicators show mixed signals, with an RSI of 84.46 suggesting overbought territory, while the Awesome Oscillator at 0.083 and Momentum Indicator at 0.12 indicate residual upward energy. Bulls have driven the price up, yet the high RSI hints at a potential corrective pullback. Traders may consider holding above support levels and taking profits near resistance. Caution is advised while monitoring trend confirmations in this bullish altcoin market. Hedera (HBAR): Recent Surge Amid Long-Term Correction and Key Levels HBAR recorded strong gains over the last month, climbing over 40% in a week and reaching a 57% increase overall. However, the six-month perspective shows a 35% decline, highlighting a contrasting long-term trend. Price movements have been between a low of $0.1235 and a high of $0.1815, reflecting short-term bullish sentiment despite the broader downtrend. This volatility led to sharp price rallies followed by corrections, balancing risk and potential rewards. Recent technical signals show an influx of buyers even as the longer-term outlook remains challenging. Currently, HBAR is trading within a narrow range between $0.1235 and $0.1815, with support at $0.0958 and resistance first observed near $0.21, followed by a higher resistance at $0.27. The Relative Strength Index around 79.40 suggests overbought conditions, though recent price increases indicate a short-term bullish outlook. Indicators like the Awesome Oscillator and Momentum Indicator imply sellers may emerge around key resistance levels. Traders should monitor for a hold above support for potential long positions or consider selling on rallies toward resistance, using incrementally adjusted targets and tight stop-losses to manage risk. Conclusion XLM , ALGO , and HBAR are showing strong potential for significant gains. These altcoins have unique features and developments that set them apart. XLM focuses on facilitating cross-border payments. ALGO prioritizes efficiency and speed in transactions. HBAR offers a unique consensus mechanism that promises faster and more secure transactions. Diversifying with these altcoins may enhance the chances of achieving high returns in the coming months. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-07-18T10:29:28,"XRP Price Prediction 2025 – Lark Davis Says $16 Possible After Breakout","The post XRP Price Prediction 2025 – Lark Davis Says $16 Possible After Breakout appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Across social channels and trading floors, optimism around XRP is exploding. After breaking out of a long-standing consolidation pattern, XRP price soared past $3.50 this week — a 40% surge in just seven days. This rally comes on the back of institutional inflows, crypto-friendly U.S. regulations (like the GENIUS Act), and strong ETF momentum. XRP’s market cap jumped from $185 billion to over $215 billion in one day, while its 24-hour trading volume exceeded $23 billion, with heavy buying seen on Coinbase and Kraken. Lark Davis Says XRP Price Breakout Is “Juicy” In a recent podcast , crypto analyst Lark Davis dissected XRP’s explosive move. He noted that XRP had been coiling inside a symmetrical triangle since early 2024. On July 9, it finally broke out — a classic bullish continuation signal. “This breakout was juicy,” said Davis. “We’ve been watching XRP coil for months. Now it’s game on.” According to Davis, XRP has now flipped the critical $3 level from resistance to support. If this level holds on the retest, it could set the stage for new all-time highs. If not, XRP could dip back into the $2.60–$3 range before another leg up. XRP Price Targets: $4.10 to $7 in the Short Term? Davis highlighted a technical target of $4.10, based on the height of the triangle pattern. A Fibonacci extension also points to $4.68 as a likely top in the next move. Based on options data, there’s a 19% chance of XRP hitting $4.50 by September, and a 5% chance of touching $7. “If Bitcoin hits $150K,” Davis added, “then $4.50 or even $7 XRP becomes very realistic.” Could Ripple XRP Price Hit $16? From a macro perspective, on-chain analyst Ali Martinez revealed a breakout from a 7-year symmetrical triangle on XRP’s weekly chart. A confirmed weekly close above $3 could set XRP up for a full bull run . Potential price targets? $6, $8.96, and even $16.17, based on historical triangle breakouts. Martinez also cited a rare MVRV golden cross, which compares market value to realized value. The last time this signal flashed, XRP rallied 630%. If history repeats, XRP’s current momentum may be just the beginning. XRP Price Prediction 2025: What to Expect? Looking ahead, XRP could be one of the top altcoins to watch in the next bull cycle. With regulatory clarity, growing institutional support, and Ripple’s expanding ecosystem, many analysts believe XRP could climb significantly by 2025. Some models forecast XRP price prediction 2025 between $7 and $16, while more aggressive bulls predict $20+ in a full-blown crypto market explosion.

2025-07-18T10:28:24,"Here’s the Next Crypto to Blow as XRP Breaks Through $3.4 ATH and Trading Volume Spikes by Nearly 4x in 2 Days","$XRP surged in the charts over the past 24 hours, pushing it past its ATH of $3.4 from January 2025, with a market cap now surpassing $200B. The token now sits at $3.45 , following a 5% rally over the past day and 32% for the last week. The sudden surge catapulted $XRP in the charts, such that it now ranks as the 3rd largest crypto coin on the market, surpassing Tether $USDT’s market cap by $60B and placing itself below Bitcoin and Ethereum. But what’s behind this meteoric rise, and should we expect more? The House Passes Trump’s GENIUS Act, Firing Up the Crypto Bull We can largely attribute $XRP’s chart boom to the House of Representatives passing the GENIUS Act , which seeks to establish a clearer and more coherent regulatory framework for stablecoins. Senate Banking Committee Chairman, Tim Scott, applauded the move, declaring that: The GENIUS Act marks a major milestone in securing America’s leadership in payments innovation while protecting consumers and strengthening our national security.This bill is critical to delivering on President Trump’s agenda to cement the United States as the crypto capital of the world, and I look forward to taking a similar approach to get digital asset market structure legislation signed into law. — Tim Scott, Official Statement Tim Scott has been a long supporter of America’s pro-crypto policy, declaring back in January that his goal is to undo the SEC’s Gary Gensler’s anti-crypto stance, which forced many crypto projects overseas. The passing of the GENIUS Act will have significant repercussions in the crypto world, as it plans to turn crypto mainstream by merging it with US’s payment systems. In simpler terms, more people will use crypto than ever because the US government is essentially now vouching for crypto products. This explains Bitcoin’s new ATH of $123,200 on June 14, as well as $XRP’s more recent surge, with the latter raising even more eyebrows. $XRP surpassed Bitcoin’s growth by a factor of 5 over the past week, with 5% to Bitcoin’s 0.44%. With Bitcoin still pushing up and $XRP attempting its own run for a $4 ATH, it’s expected that some of the best crypto presales in 2025 will follow suit as the market maintains its upward pressure. Here are three of the most promising tokens you can get into today. 1. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – The Solana-Based Trading Bot Sniping Hot Tokens in Telegram Snorter Token ($SNORT) introduces the Snorter Bot, a trader’s most loyal friend, which snipes hot tokens straight from its Telegram chat. The Bot solves most problems associated with manual coin hunting, which include the high tech knowledge requirement and the risk of running into scams like honeypots and rug pulls. Snorter Bot simplifies the entire process of opportunistic investing by centralizing its activity in the Telegram chat; no more juggling multiple wallets, browser extensions, or trading tools. The project’s express utility, along with the meme value coming with the sniper-armed Aardvark, explains the presale’s performance so far. $SNORT’s presale has accumulated over $2M at this point since May with a starting token price of $0.09350000. The coin now sits at $0.0985, as it’s guaranteed to increase during the presale and after. Our analysts predict a $0.94 price point for $SNORT before the year’s end and $3.25 by 2030 , provided the project witnesses successful implementation and widespread adoption. Based on the current price of $0.0985, a potential $3.25 price point translates into an ROI of 3,200% for a 5-year investment. If you want to support the project, visit the presale page and buy your $SNORT today . 2. XRP ($XRP) – The Cost-Effective and Tool-Rich Blockchain for Businesses and Individuals With XRP ($XRP) booming in the charts, it was only natural that it would find its way on today’s list. XRP Ledger is the decentralized ecosystem that offers businesses and developers the tools they need to create value and solve problems. XRP comes with a variety of tools aimed at both novice and veteran developers, like SDKs, open-source libraries, and Nodes. With Ripple applying for banking license as well, XRP will also enter the banking system soon, providing banks with flexible solutions to managing their Central Bank Issued Digital Currencies (CBDS.) Between this and the House passing the GENIUS Act recently, XRP is likely rallying for another bull run. The token sits at $3.45 , but it’s under an 5% upwards pressure right now, so we expect it to break another ATH at $4 soon, probably today or tomorrow, if sentiment holds. If you want to invest, go to your preferred exchange and buy your $XRP while it’s hot. 3. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Bitcoin’s Layer 2 Upgrade Coming with Faster Transactions and Lower Fees Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is Bitcoin’s official Layer 2 upgrade that promises to achieve what the Lightning Network couldn’t: faster transactions and lower fees. The project relies on two primary tools to achieve these goals. The first is the Canonical Bridge, which mints the users’ tokens onto the Hyper layer, helping with network decongestion. The Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) enables the ultra-fast execution of smart contracts and DeFi apps, boosting Bitcoin’s overall performance. As expected, faster transactions would translate into lower network fees, which would bring the Bitcoin ecosystem to modern-day standards in terms of performance, without compromising its security or brand value. The project is still in presale and has accumulated over $3.3M so far, with a token price of $0.0123, since its start date in May. These numbers recommend Bitcoin Hyper as one of the best presales of 2025, with $HYPER likely to boom post-launch. We expect the token to reach a price point of $0.32 by the end of 2025 and $1.50 or higher by 2030 . In profit numbers, a $100 investment today would bring you $12,195 in just five years. You can support the project and join the FOMO train by visiting the presale page and buying your $HYPERs today. Will $XRP Break the $4 ATH? All evidence points at the fact that $XRP is likely to break the $4 ceiling soon with Trump’s newly approved GENIUS Act being the main catalyst. $XRP’s $ATH would add more fuel to the crypto fire currently scorching the market ever since Bitcoin broke through its first $123 ATH. As XRP and Bitcoin rally, projects like Snorter Token ($SNORT) and Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) will also see consistent gains, primarily thanks to their utility and long-term potential. Remember, this isn’t financial advice.

According to new on-chain intelligence data from Arkham, the world’s largest asset manager has bought $547 million worth of Ethereum in a single day, $50 million more than its Bitcoin ( BTC ) inflow over the same period. BLACKROCK IS STILL BUYING MORE ETH THAN BTC BlackRock’s purchase of over half a billion dollars of ETH ($547M) exceeded its Bitcoin inflow ($497M) by $50 Million USD. Weighted by market cap, BlackRock is buying over 5 TIMES the amount of ETH compared to BTC. pic.twitter.com/fnvjvKXQ0N — Arkham (@arkham) July 18, 2025 The surge was detected via blockchain monitoring tools that track wallet movements tied to institutional investors, but the raw dollar figures tell only part of the story. When adjusted for market capitalization, BlackRock’s Ethereum purchases are over 5 times larger than its Bitcoin buys, a staggering imbalance that hints at deeper institutional conviction in ETH’s relative upside potential. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $118,755 with a market cap of $2.36 trillion, while Ethereum is priced at $3,620 with a market cap of $437 billion. The relative size difference means BlackRock’s ETH accumulation carries significantly more market impact on a percentage basis making its strategy even more striking. BlackRock’s Ethereum holdings As of July 18, BlackRock’s total Ethereum holdings stand at $7.75 billion, following months of consistent accumulation. Meanwhile, the firm’s Bitcoin exposure, while still massive, appears to be growing at a slower pace relative to ETH. The asset manager’s aggressive Ethereum strategy has raised eyebrows among analysts, especially given its traditionally cautious stance on altcoins. Some speculate that the move may be tied to BlackRock’s ambitions in tokenized finance or ETH’s role in powering real-world asset infrastructure.

2025-07-18T10:21:06,"Bitcoin’s Crucial Juncture: Breaking the $120K Resistance, Next Stop $136K","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Crucial Juncture: Breaking the $120K Resistance, Next Stop $136K The cryptocurrency world is abuzz! Bitcoin (BTC), the undisputed king of digital assets, has once again captured the spotlight, hitting a significant milestone that has analysts and investors on the edge of their seats. This isn’t just any price point; it’s a critical juncture, a moment where the future trajectory of the Bitcoin Price could be decided. As reported by Glassnode, BTC has touched a key resistance level near $120,000, a threshold derived from sophisticated on-chain metrics. Understanding the Current Bitcoin Price Momentum: What’s Driving the Surge? Bitcoin’s journey to this pivotal $120,000 mark hasn’t been without its twists and turns, but the underlying momentum has been undeniably strong. Several factors contribute to the current bullish sentiment surrounding the Bitcoin Price . Institutional adoption continues to grow, with major financial players increasingly recognizing Bitcoin’s value as a store of wealth and a hedge against inflation. The narrative of Bitcoin as ‘digital gold’ is strengthening, attracting traditional investors seeking diversification in an uncertain global economic climate. Furthermore, the halving event, a programmed reduction in the supply of new Bitcoin, often acts as a significant catalyst for price appreciation. While the immediate impact isn’t always felt, the long-term supply shock tends to create upward pressure. Retail interest also plays a crucial role; as prices rise, more individual investors are drawn into the market, creating a virtuous cycle of demand. This confluence of factors has propelled Bitcoin into a zone where its resilience and strength are truly being tested. The $120,000 level isn’t just a round number; it represents a deeply analyzed point of market equilibrium and potential resistance, making its breach a highly anticipated event for anyone following the crypto space. Decoding Bitcoin Resistance : What Glassnode Analytics Reveal? When we talk about Bitcoin Resistance , especially at such high valuations, it’s essential to understand the underlying data driving these observations. Glassnode, a leading on-chain analytics platform, has pinpointed the $120,000 level as +1 standard deviation above the short-term holder cost basis. But what does that mean in practical terms for the Bitcoin Price ? The Significance of Short-Term Holder Cost Basis What it is: The short-term holder cost basis represents the average price at which Bitcoin was acquired by investors who have held their coins for less than 155 days. These are typically newer entrants or more active traders. Why it matters: This metric acts as a crucial psychological and economic anchor. When the price falls below this cost basis, short-term holders are generally at a loss, increasing the likelihood of selling pressure. Conversely, when the price is significantly above it, these holders are in profit, and the cost basis often acts as a support level. Resistance Point: When the price reaches a certain multiple or deviation above this cost basis, it often signals a point where a significant number of short-term holders might consider taking profits, thus creating a resistance level. Understanding Standard Deviations in Market Analysis Standard deviation is a statistical measure that quantifies the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of data values. In financial markets, it’s used to measure volatility and identify price levels that are statistically significant departures from the average. Glassnode’s use of standard deviations in relation to the short-term holder cost basis provides a powerful framework: +1 Standard Deviation: This level indicates that the current price is one standard deviation above the average acquisition price for short-term holders. Historically, in strong uptrends, this level has frequently acted as a psychological or actual resistance point where profit-taking might occur. It suggests the market is entering an area where it’s considered ‘overbought’ relative to recent short-term activity. +2 Standard Deviations: Should Bitcoin successfully push past the +1 standard deviation resistance, the next significant target often lies at +2 standard deviations. This level represents an even greater statistical deviation from the average cost basis, implying a more extended or aggressive move. Reaching this point, in this case, $136,000, would signify extreme bullish momentum and potentially a blow-off top for the short term, or a re-calibration of what constitutes a ‘normal’ price for Bitcoin. These on-chain metrics offer a unique lens into market behavior, moving beyond simple technical analysis by peering into the actual economics of different investor cohorts. They provide a data-driven perspective on where potential selling pressure or demand might emerge. Navigating the Crypto Market Analysis : What’s Next for BTC? The current scenario presents a fascinating challenge for Crypto Market Analysis . Bitcoin is at a crossroads, with the $120,000 level acting as a crucial test. What happens next could set the tone for the coming weeks or even months for the Bitcoin Price . Potential Scenarios at $120K Breakout and Continuation: If Bitcoin can decisively break above $120,000 with strong volume, it would signal immense bullish strength. This would likely trigger a cascade of buy orders, as traders who were waiting on the sidelines jump in, aiming for the next target at $136,000. A sustained move above this resistance would convert it into a new support level, reinforcing the upward trend. Rejection and Consolidation/Correction: Conversely, if Bitcoin fails to hold above $120,000, we could see a rejection. This might lead to a period of consolidation, where the price trades sideways, or a minor correction as profit-takers step in. Such a pullback would be healthy for the market, allowing it to cool off before potentially attempting another run at the resistance. False Breakout (Bull Trap): A less desirable scenario would be a brief push above $120,000, only for the price to quickly fall back below it. This is often referred to as a ‘bull trap,’ enticing buyers only to leave them holding bags as the price declines. Historical Parallels and Market Psychology History often rhymes in financial markets. Bitcoin has encountered and overcome significant resistance levels throughout its existence. Each time it breaks through an all-time high or a major psychological barrier, it re-prices itself into a new range. The current $120,000 level is not an all-time high, but its significance derived from Glassnode’s on-chain metrics makes it equally important. Market psychology plays a huge role here. Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) can drive prices higher during breakouts, while fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) can exacerbate pullbacks. The sentiment around the $120,000 mark will be critical. If the market perceives this level as a genuine barrier, it might induce caution; if it’s seen as just another hurdle to clear, the momentum could carry it through. Setting the Next BTC Price Target : Is $136K Within Reach? With the current price action, all eyes are firmly set on the next BTC Price Target : $136,000. This level, identified by Glassnode as +2 standard deviations above the short-term holder cost basis, represents a significant milestone. But what would it take to reach it, and what are the implications? Factors Supporting a Push to $136K Sustained Buying Pressure: A continuous influx of new capital from both retail and institutional investors is paramount. Positive Macroeconomic Environment: A favorable global economic outlook, including stable interest rates and controlled inflation, can encourage risk-on assets like Bitcoin. Decreasing Exchange Supply: If more Bitcoin continues to move off exchanges into long-term storage, it reduces immediate selling pressure. Strong Fundamentals: Ongoing development in the Bitcoin ecosystem, improved scalability solutions, and increased utility could bolster confidence. Challenges and Risks on the Path to $136K While the prospect of $136,000 is exciting, it’s crucial to acknowledge the potential challenges: Challenge Category Description Regulatory Headwinds New regulations or stricter enforcement in major economies could introduce uncertainty and deter investment. Macroeconomic Shocks Unexpected global events, such as a severe recession or geopolitical conflict, could lead to a flight from risk assets. Whale Selling Large holders (‘whales’) taking significant profits could trigger a cascading sell-off. Market Saturation/Exhaustion If the market becomes overextended, a natural correction might occur as buying power diminishes. Reaching $136,000 would be a monumental achievement, signaling a robust and potentially accelerating bull market. It would validate the strength of the current uptrend and potentially draw in even more institutional and retail capital, further cementing Bitcoin’s position in the global financial landscape. However, prudent investors will also consider the risks and prepare for potential volatility. Insights from Glassnode Analytics : A Deeper Look into On-Chain Data The power of Glassnode Analytics lies in its ability to translate complex blockchain data into actionable market insights. Beyond just standard deviations and cost bases, Glassnode provides a suite of metrics that offer unparalleled transparency into the inner workings of the Bitcoin network and the behavior of its participants. This includes: SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio): This metric indicates whether coins are being sold at a profit or loss. A SOPR value above 1 suggests coins are being sold in profit, while below 1 indicates losses. It can help identify market tops and bottoms. Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL): This metric gauges the overall profitability of the Bitcoin supply. It divides the market into psychological zones (e.g., euphoria, belief, hope, fear, capitulation), providing a broad overview of market sentiment. Miner Behavior: Tracking miner revenue, accumulation, or distribution can offer clues about their confidence in future price movements, as miners are often forced sellers to cover operational costs. Exchange Flows: Monitoring the amount of Bitcoin moving onto or off exchanges can indicate whether investors are preparing to sell (moving to exchanges) or hold/accumulate (moving off exchanges to cold storage). These advanced metrics, combined with traditional technical analysis, offer a comprehensive view that helps investors make more informed decisions. The current Glassnode report highlighting the $120,000 resistance and $136,000 target is a prime example of how on-chain data can provide leading indicators for future price action, moving beyond mere price charts. Actionable Insights for Investors and Traders Given the current market dynamics and the insights from Glassnode, what should investors and traders consider? Monitor Volume: Pay close attention to trading volume as Bitcoin approaches or attempts to break $120,000. A strong breakout should be accompanied by significant buying volume. Risk Management: For traders, setting stop-loss orders below key support levels is crucial to manage downside risk if the resistance holds or a correction occurs. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Long-term investors might view any pullback as a buying opportunity, while short-term traders will be more focused on the immediate price action around resistance. Diversification: While Bitcoin is strong, maintaining a diversified portfolio across different cryptocurrencies or asset classes can mitigate risk. Stay Informed: Continue to follow reputable on-chain analytics platforms like Glassnode, as well as broader macroeconomic news, to stay ahead of market shifts. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Bitcoin’s Trajectory Bitcoin stands at a truly defining moment. The $120,000 resistance level, meticulously identified by Glassnode through its sophisticated on-chain metrics like the short-term holder cost basis and standard deviations, represents a pivotal test for the current bull run. Successfully breaking this barrier could unlock the path to the ambitious $136,000 BTC Price Target , signaling a new phase of growth and solidifying Bitcoin’s position as a dominant force in the financial world. However, like any major financial asset, Bitcoin’s journey is subject to various influences, from market psychology to macroeconomic shifts. Investors and enthusiasts alike will be watching closely, ready to adapt to whatever the market decides. This is not just about price; it’s about the ongoing maturation and validation of the entire digital asset ecosystem.

2025-07-18T10:20:09,"Unveiling Crypto Cycles: Altcoin Season Index at 40 Confirms Bitcoin’s Powerful Reign","BitcoinWorld Unveiling Crypto Cycles: Altcoin Season Index at 40 Confirms Bitcoin’s Powerful Reign Are you tracking the pulse of the cryptocurrency market? If so, the latest reading from the Altcoin Season Index should capture your attention. As of 00:30 UTC on July 18, this crucial metric, tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), registered 40. This figure, a slight uptick from the previous day’s 38 reported by Bitcoin World, sends a clear signal across the digital asset landscape: we are firmly entrenched in Bitcoin Season . But what exactly does this mean for your portfolio, and how should you navigate these prevailing crypto market trends ? Decoding the Altcoin Season Index: Your Compass in Crypto Market Trends To truly understand the current market dynamics, it’s essential to grasp the mechanism behind the Altcoin Season Index . This isn’t just a random number; it’s a sophisticated barometer designed to give investors a snapshot of where capital is flowing within the top echelons of the crypto space. Here’s a breakdown: What it tracks: The index rigorously compares the 90-day performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap. Importantly, it excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens, focusing solely on the volatile, speculative assets that truly reflect market sentiment. How it defines a ‘Season’: The index operates on a simple yet profound principle. For the market to be declared in ‘Altcoin Season,’ at least 75% of these top 100 coins must have outperformed Bitcoin over the preceding 90 days. Conversely, ‘Bitcoin Season’ is declared when 25% or fewer of these altcoins manage to outshine Bitcoin. The Score Range: The index scores range from 1 to 100, providing a clear visual representation of the market’s bias. A score closer to 1 signifies strong Bitcoin dominance, while a score closer to 100 indicates a robust altcoin rally. Our current score of 40 firmly places us in Bitcoin territory. This index serves as a vital tool, offering insights beyond mere price movements. It helps investors identify broader crypto market trends and anticipate shifts in capital allocation, which is fundamental for any sound digital asset strategy . What Does Bitcoin Season Mean for Altcoin Performance? When the Altcoin Season Index dips into the Bitcoin Season zone, it signals a period where Bitcoin typically commands the spotlight, drawing capital away from or preventing it from flowing into smaller cryptocurrencies. This phenomenon is a recurring theme in crypto cycles, driven by several factors: Why Bitcoin Takes the Lead: Safe Haven Appeal: In times of uncertainty or volatility, Bitcoin often acts as a ‘digital gold,’ a perceived safer store of value compared to the myriad of more speculative altcoins. Investors tend to consolidate their holdings into BTC. Liquidity and Market Depth: Bitcoin boasts unparalleled liquidity, making it easier for large institutional investors and whales to enter and exit positions without significantly impacting prices. This depth is often lacking in many altcoin markets. Institutional Interest: With the advent of Bitcoin ETFs and increasing institutional adoption, a significant portion of new capital entering the crypto space often flows directly into Bitcoin first, before potentially trickling down into altcoins. Halving Cycle Influence: Bitcoin’s halving events, which reduce the supply of new BTC, historically precede bull runs. The anticipation and post-halving dynamics often lead to Bitcoin outperforming altcoins initially. During Bitcoin Season , the average altcoin performance tends to lag. While Bitcoin makes significant gains, many altcoins might consolidate, trade sideways, or even experience declines against BTC. This doesn’t mean all altcoins will suffer equally, but the general trend favors Bitcoin. Navigating Altcoin Performance: Are All Altcoins Doomed? While the overall sentiment points to Bitcoin dominance, it’s crucial to understand that not every altcoin will underperform. The crypto market is nuanced, and even within a Bitcoin Season , specific narratives or niche sectors can see bursts of activity. However, these are often exceptions rather than the rule, and require careful research. Here’s what typically happens to altcoin performance during these periods: Capital Rotation: Funds often rotate out of altcoins and into Bitcoin, especially from projects with less clear utility or weaker fundamentals. Increased Volatility: Altcoins can become more volatile, with sharper corrections against Bitcoin as investors de-risk. Selective Pumps: Occasionally, a specific altcoin might experience a significant pump due to a unique catalyst (e.g., major upgrade, new partnership, strong community narrative), but these are often short-lived and highly speculative. For investors, this period can be a test of patience and discipline. Chasing every small altcoin pump during a Bitcoin-dominant phase can lead to significant losses if not managed strategically. Crafting Your Digital Asset Strategy in a Bitcoin-Led Market Given the current market signal from the Altcoin Season Index , adapting your digital asset strategy becomes paramount. This isn’t a time for panic, but rather for strategic adjustments. Here are some actionable insights: 1. Prioritize Bitcoin Accumulation With Bitcoin showing strength, this period can be an opportune time to accumulate more BTC, especially if you believe in its long-term trajectory. Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) into Bitcoin can be an effective way to build your position without trying to time the market perfectly. 2. Re-evaluate Your Altcoin Holdings This is a good moment for portfolio introspection. Assess your altcoin holdings: Do they have strong fundamentals? Are they tied to emerging narratives that could gain traction post-Bitcoin Season? Are you over-exposed to highly speculative altcoins? Consider trimming positions in weaker altcoins to reduce risk or to free up capital for Bitcoin or more promising projects. 3. Focus on Quality and Utility During Bitcoin Season, projects with real-world utility, robust development teams, and strong communities tend to weather the storm better. Look for altcoins that are building infrastructure, solving real problems, or have clear adoption pathways, rather than just hype. 4. Manage Risk Prudently Volatility is inherent in crypto. Implement strong risk management practices: Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose. Use stop-loss orders if you are actively trading. Diversify your portfolio, even within a Bitcoin-heavy strategy, to mitigate single-asset risk. Understanding these principles is key to building a resilient digital asset strategy that can thrive across various market cycles. When Might Altcoin Season Return? Observing Key Indicators While we are currently in Bitcoin Season , the crypto market is cyclical. Altcoin Season will eventually return, but it typically requires specific conditions to materialize. Here are some indicators to watch for: Indicator What to Look For Significance for Altcoin Season Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) Sustained sideways movement or decline after a significant rise. Indicates capital might be flowing out of BTC and into altcoins. Ethereum’s Performance Ethereum (ETH) begins to outperform Bitcoin significantly. ETH often leads the altcoin market, acting as a bellwether for broader altcoin rallies. Emerging Narratives New technologies or sectors (e.g., AI, DePIN, Gaming) gain significant traction. Fresh capital often flows into these new, exciting areas, boosting specific altcoins. Retail Investor Sentiment Increased interest and participation from retail investors in smaller caps. Retail often drives altcoin pumps, indicating a shift from institutional-led Bitcoin runs. Observing these indicators, alongside the Altcoin Season Index itself, will provide valuable clues about the next phase of crypto market trends and when a broader shift in altcoin performance might occur. The Challenges and Opportunities of Current Crypto Market Trends Every market phase presents both challenges and opportunities. In a Bitcoin Season , the primary challenge for many investors is the temptation to chase quick gains in altcoins that might not have the fundamental strength to sustain rallies. Patience is key, as is a realistic expectation of altcoin performance relative to Bitcoin. However, this period also offers significant opportunities: Accumulation Phase: For long-term investors, a Bitcoin-dominant period can be an excellent time to accumulate high-quality altcoins at potentially lower prices relative to Bitcoin, setting the stage for future gains when Altcoin Season eventually arrives. Research and Education: Use this time to dive deeper into projects, understand their technology, and identify truly innovative solutions. A well-informed digital asset strategy is your best defense against market volatility. Risk Management Refinement: Review and refine your risk management protocols. This market phase is a good reminder of the importance of position sizing and diversification. Conclusion: Mastering Your Digital Asset Strategy Amidst Evolving Crypto Market Trends The Altcoin Season Index at 40 is a clear indicator that we are currently navigating a period of Bitcoin dominance. While this may mean a challenging environment for broad altcoin performance , it is also a crucial phase for strategic investors. Understanding these prevailing crypto market trends allows you to make informed decisions, whether that involves strengthening your Bitcoin position, re-evaluating your altcoin holdings, or patiently waiting for the next altcoin cycle. By focusing on robust fundamentals, adopting a disciplined digital asset strategy , and closely monitoring key market indicators, you can position yourself to not only weather the current season but also thrive when the winds inevitably shift, ushering in the next exhilarating phase of the crypto journey.

2025-07-18T10:20:08,"Crypto Finance Firm Matrixport Shares Bitcoin Expectations in Its Latest Report! Here Are the Details","Crypto finance firm Matrixport, in its latest “Matrix on Target” report, predicted that Bitcoin may enter a correction process in the short term despite its recent upward trend. Matrixport: Bitcoin May Enter Short-Term Correction Following Multiple Factors The report states that despite positive macroeconomic developments in the US, technical indicators have weakened and the market may enter a consolidation phase in the next 1-2 months. Matrixport reminded that Bitcoin has been in a gradual upward trend since $16,000 in the last 18 months, and stated that the $106,000–108,000 level currently constitutes support. The firm argued that $122,000 is a reasonable next target, but the market may need a short-term correction before that level is reached. Overbought Signals Becoming Clearer Noting that Bitcoin has entered the overbought region from a technical perspective, the report emphasized that the RSI has risen above the 70 level and some pullback signals have formed. In this context, it was stated that a pullback to the $106,000-$108,000 region could pave the way for the next upward wave. US inflation in June, falling below expectations at 2.8%, has fueled market expectations for a near-term Fed rate cut. The report says these developments are providing support to the market, but cautions that “over-optimism” could pose a risk. Matrixport also stated that strong signals for a rate cut could be given at the FOMC meeting on July 30, but September is a more likely timeframe. While Matrixport predicts a short-term correction, it states that the long-term structure remains intact, but rather part of a healthy market cycle. The report also warns that technical formations such as “blow-off tops” or “double tops” may form following sudden market increases. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-18T10:16:32,"Bitcoin (BTC) Bulls Gear Up for the Next Bull Market Surge","The Bitcoin bulls have perhaps found a decent platform at $118,000 from which to launch their next upward surge. However, before this next rocketship takes off, there could be more sideways price action. Investors will probably need to remain patient. Crypto bills passed up to the Senate The crypto story continues to gain momentum in the US as three landmark bills gained approval in the House this week. The GENIUS Act , CLARITY Act , and CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act were all passed on to the Senate for consideration. If these bills do make it into law this will firm up the case for crypto in the most powerful country in the world - quite a rapid turnaround from the bleak and unyielding anti-crypto stance presented by the Biden administration. While the CLARITY Act will help to provide consumer protection and clear regulatory guidelines for businesses, and the GENIUS Act will promote the setting up of regulation for stablecoins, arguably the most impactful bill is the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act. Anti-CBDC Act the most important CBCD’s (Central Bank Digital Currencies) have generally been kept on the down-low in mainstream media for quite some time, and it’s only in recent times that the likes of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and others, have felt emboldened enough to announce the future implementation of CBDCs. This programmable digital currency would allow central banks to wield far more power over citizens than they already have, allowing them to manipulate, confiscate, and sanction bank accounts at will. $BTC retests support Source: TradingView Meanwhile, Bitcoin continues on into the latter stages of its bull market. As can be seen in the short-term time frame, the price broke out of the relatively short downtrend but the bulls were unable to maintain momentum and the price is falling back down. The trendline is about to be tested again, and possibly the horizontal support at $118,000. If this gives way and the bears are able to confirm the breakdown, $117,000 down to $116,000 would be a possible net waiting to catch the price. Falling below that would mean a collapse back down to $112,000. That said, as things stand, this looks as though it may just be a retest of support. As has been the case for quite some time now, the trend is up, and if in doubt, go with that trend. $BTC volatility increase Source: TradingView The daily chart shows a lot of volatility since $BTC crossed above $118,000. The candle wicks to the up and to the downside are evidence of the struggle going on among the bulls and the bears. This support level is continuing to hold, but as already mentioned, a collapse, or even just a wick back down to $112,000 could still be on the cards. At the bottom of the chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) which signals overbought and oversold conditions, is key to further price appreciation. The indicator has already been well into the overbought zone, but it still did not get above the last peak at 78.29. The indicator will probably need to bounce off of the yellow moving average and head higher to take out that last peak, if this doesn’t happen, bearish divergence is still in play. Weekly Stochastic RSI indicators approach a top again Source: TradingView The weekly time frame reveals that generally all is well with the Bitcoin bull market. That said, the Stochastic RSI indicator lines are approaching the top again. There could be two or three weeks left in them yet, and there’s always the chance that they could move along the top for quite some time. However, when they get this high it is best to keep an eye open for any other potential topping signals. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-07-18T10:15:13,"HTX Hot Listings Weekly Recap (July 7 – 14): Bitcoin Tops $120,000, New Tokens Listed on HTX Post Impressive Returns","HTX, a leading global crypto exchange, is thrilled to announce the exceptional performance of its newly listed assets, coinciding with Bitcoin ‘s groundbreaking surge past $120,000. In a period of renewed market optimism and significant capital rotation, HTX’s latest listings have once again showcased substantial wealth-generating potential. This solidifies the platform’s reputation as a go-to destination for investors looking to capitalize on emerging market trends. Between July 7 and 14, new listings across the Meme, NFT, and Infrastructure sectors achieved impressive gains. These remarkable results highlight HTX’s strategic ability to identify and list high-potential assets, providing significant wealth creation opportunities for its global user base. Meme Coin Resurgence Led by M and MOG The resurgence of meme coins saw two prominent assets deliver significant returns: ● Memecore ($M) surged an astounding 482% in just days, firmly topping the gainers’ list. Positioned as the first Layer 1 blockchain designed for the Meme 2.0 era, $M is set to become an engine driving meme culture, value creation, and community collaboration. ● MOG Coin ($MOG), another prominent meme coin, recorded a remarkable 112% increase. This Ethereum-based asset has recently garnered significant attention and discussion across social platforms. The surge in meme coin assets reaffirms the market logic that “emotion is value”. As one of the first platforms to list these tokens, HTX has effectively transformed community sentiment into trading activity, delivering tangible returns for users. Infrastructure and Cross-Chain Narratives Regain Momentum with Strong Performances from OMNI and TANSSI Technologically driven assets also performed well this week. ● Omni Network ($OMNI) jumped 260%, driven by renewed interest in inter-chain interoperability. As an Ethereum-native interoperability protocol, Omni Network enables low-latency communication across all Ethereum rollups and offers a secure, high-performance, and globally compatible architecture — positioning Ethereum as a single, unified operating system for both users and developers. ● Tanssi Network ($TANSSI) climbed the ranks with an 82% increase.

Its ecosystem also includes management tools, ready-to-use templates, and key integrations like wallets, indexers, RPC endpoints, block explorers, and oracles. HTX’s early identification of the infrastructure trend empowered previously overlooked assets to gain significant momentum on the platform, showcasing the precision of its listing strategy. $PENGU Surges on Enterprise NFT Buzz, NFT Sector Stages Strong Comeback Recently, the rise of the “enterprise NFT” narrative has sparked growing interest, with both established brands and new IPs leveraging NFTs to broaden community engagement. As a result, NFT assets are experiencing a resurgence, demonstrating strong wealth potential in this new context. ● Pudgy Penguins ($ PENGU ) witnessed an impressive 89% surge in a short period. This collection of 8,888 NFTs drives Web3 innovation through IP licensing and community-driven empowerment. Each holder gets exclusive access to experiences, events, IP licensing opportunities, and more. $PENGU has distinguished itself as one of the few NFT projects to achieve both substantial traffic and high trading volume. Popular Assets Rally as XLM and KNC Maintain Resilience Beyond the newly listed assets, established popular assets also saw significant movement: ● XLM (Stellar) rose 88%, benefiting from heightened payment activity and growing stablecoin clearing needs. As an open payment network, Stellar bridges diverse financial systems, empowering anyone to create low-cost financial services for their communities. This interconnectedness enhances individual access, reduces banking costs, and boosts business revenue. ● Kyber Network ($KNC) recorded a 65% gain, emerging as a standout in the DEX sector. The surge was driven by the release of new DeFi versions and liquidity incentive programs. Kyber Network aims to build a system that supports instant trading and seamless conversion of diverse digital assets. It offers robust payment APIs and next-generation contract wallets, enabling smooth token-to-token payments for all users. The rise of these assets also signals a broader market shift from pure emotional speculation to projects backed by real-world applications and strong liquidity support.

In a recent interview , Saylor outlined annual targets of 12% for the S&P 500 and 18-20% for Bitcoin. His reasoning is straightforward: Bitcoin doesn’t have the counterparty risk of corporate structures or currency exposure that plagues traditional stocks. “Bitcoin is pure capital,” Saylor stated, noting it faces no tariff or supply chain issues, management problems, or political risks that burden S&P 500 companies. Strategy price analysis MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy has paid off spectacularly. In fact, the company just closed at an all-time high market capitalization. The stock has climbed 22.30% over the past month, closing Thursday at $451.34, up 50.44% year-to-date. $MSTR just closed at an all-time high market cap. pic.twitter.com/2MtLBczzzu — Michael Saylor (@saylor) July 16, 2025 Meanwhile, Bitcoin has surged 10% over the past month, hitting new highs of $122,884 on Monday before pulling back to $118,583.

Walton estimated the company will report a $14 billion profit in Q2, translating to roughly $11 billion in net profit over the past 12 months. However, qualifying doesn’t guarantee inclusion; the S&P 500 committee still has complete discretion and some analysts argue the firm now operates more like a closed-end fund than an operating business. Strategy will release its latest earnings report on July 31 after the market close. The company has reported net losses for the past three quarters, although investors seem to be focused on Bitcoin’s appreciation rather than traditional software metrics.

2025-07-18T10:07:35,"Buy, Borrow, Die: The Wealth Hack of the Ultra-Rich – Explained for Crypto Investors","In the world of high finance, the wealthy play by a different set of rules—especially when it comes to taxes. One of the most powerful and legally savvy strategies they use is known as Buy, Borrow, Die . This approach helps the ultra-rich accumulate wealth, access liquidity, and legally avoid capital gains taxes —often permanently. Here’s how this strategy works, why it’s popular, and what it might mean for crypto holders like you. 🛒 Step 1: Buy (or HODL) Appreciating Assets The journey starts with buying assets that grow in value over time . This could include: Stocks (e.g. Apple, Tesla) Real estate Business shares And yes— crypto assets like BTC, ETH, or SOL When these assets appreciate, the gains are unrealized —meaning you don’t pay capital gains tax until you sell . So if you buy 10 BTC at $10K and it grows to $60K, that’s a $500K gain... but no taxes are due as long as you don’t sell. 💳 Step 2: Borrow (Don’t Sell) Rather than cashing out and triggering a taxable event, the wealthy simply borrow against their assets . For example: They take out loans using their stocks or real estate as collateral. In crypto, this could mean using platforms like Aave, Maker, or centralized services offering crypto-backed loans . These loans aren’t considered income , so no taxes apply . This borrowed money can be used to: Fund a luxury lifestyle Reinvest in more assets Cover living expenses Key advantage : You maintain ownership of the asset, it continues to grow in value, and you defer taxes indefinitely . ⚰ Step 3: Die (Yes, Really) Here's where the magic happens. When someone dies, their assets usually receive a ""step-up in basis"" under U.S. tax law: The cost basis (the original purchase price) is reset to the current market value. If your heirs sell the asset right after your death, they owe zero capital gains tax . So if you held BTC that went from $10K to $100K and passed it on—your heirs' new cost basis is $100K. No tax is due if they sell at that price. Translation : The capital gains tax you avoided during life is permanently erased upon death . 🔁 The Cycle: Repeat, Grow, Escape Wealthy families use this strategy for generations: Buy appreciating assets (crypto, real estate, stocks) Borrow instead of selling to avoid taxes Die , leaving tax-free wealth to heirs This allows wealth to compound tax-free , with minimal government interference. 🧨 Can Crypto Users Use This? Yes—but with caution: Crypto lending platforms allow you to borrow against assets without selling. Be aware of liquidation risks (crypto is volatile). This strategy assumes long-term bullishness on your assets. Be ready for changing tax laws —this loophole is under political scrutiny. 🧾 Why Governments Are Watching Critics argue Buy, Borrow, Die favors the ultra-wealthy , widening the wealth gap. Governments are eyeing ways to: Tax unrealized gains Remove the step-up in basis Close loopholes around wealth transfers Crypto holders could eventually see similar scrutiny, especially as DeFi lending and self-custody blur the lines of regulation . 🧠 Final Thoughts The Buy, Borrow, Die strategy is a masterclass in long-term wealth planning , taking full advantage of current tax laws. Whether you’re holding stocks or stacking sats, understanding this strategy can inspire you to think bigger about: Asset appreciation Leveraging rather than liquidating Generational planning While it may seem like a trick reserved for billionaires, crypto gives everyone a unique opportunity to be their own bank —and maybe, just maybe, play the same wealth game.",coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/buy-borrow-die-the-wealth-hack-of-the-ultra-rich-explained-for-crypto-investors,"REGULATION|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|ETH","",cryptocompare

2025-07-18T10:00:01,"Dogecoin Erupts Past $0.23—Analyst Predicts Next Price Targets","The latest burst of momentum has carried the Dogecoin price through the psychologically significant $0.23 barrier, lifting the spot price to roughly $0.236 at press time and extending a weekly advance of more than 20 percent. The breakout unfolded while Bitcoin continues to consolidate just north of the $120 000 pivot, a level that many market technicians view as decisive for the entire altcoin complex. Technical strategist Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) published a daily DOGE/USD chart via X. In it, Dogecoin’s price action is framed by a multi-month falling-trend line whose boundary was first breached in November last year. Since that escape, price has returned to the diagonal three separate times—each touch ringed by Kevin in orange, signalling what he describes as “textbook post-breakout behaviour.” Related Reading: This Fibonacci Level Puts The Dogecoin Price Above $10 This Cycle “Only a matter of time before #Dogecoin makes its move back up to the .28-.30 level and then well beyond,” he wrote. “As long as BTC holds up and keeps showing strength this should come sooner rather than later.” Dogecoin Price Targets Kevin’s roadmap is built around a dense cluster of Fibonacci retracements that dominate the right margin of his chart. Immediate resistance lies at the 0.618 and 0.65 retracement bands—approximately $0.261 and $0.285, respectively—followed by 0.703 at $0.329 and the 0.786 level at $0.413. Lower down, the 0.5 retracement at $0.190 has acted as a floor throughout July, while 0.382 at $0.138 marks the last line of defence for medium-term bulls. Beyond the classical retracement grid, Kevin projects an aggressive trio of Fibonacci extension lines—1.618 ($3.97), 1.65 ($4.33) and 1.703 ($5.00)—arguing that Dogecoin’s “thin-air zone” above last cycle’s peak could enable a parabolic overshoot if liquidity conditions mirror those of 2021. He stresses, however, that such targets “remain contingent on Bitcoin punching through $120,000-$123,000 and, ideally, sprinting toward $140,000-$150,000 where overhead supply thins out dramatically.” “People are already forgetting that #BTC drives this market and if BTC goes down it will all go down. … BTC needs to break $123,274—point-blank period. I don’t like the moseying around at this level for too long.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Poised For A Monster Rally Amid Brewing Altcoin Season For now, Bitcoin’s sideways grind below its all-time high has tempered altcoin exuberance. The macro picture is complicated by the fact that, as Kevin notes, “BTC, Total 2, ETH, and many other Alts are at major resistance levels—so do not try and be a hero here. If you missed the lows, that’s unfortunate, but do not FOMO at major resistance.” Should Bitcoin deliver the breakout the analyst community is looking for, the DOGE/BTC pair could accelerate sharply, validating Kevin’s view that the memecoin is “playing catch-up” and may be poised for an outsized percentage move once the broader market trend resumes. With Dogecoin now perched on the lip of its 0.618–0.65 resistance shelf, traders are watching for a daily close above $0.285 to confirm the next leg higher. Failure to hold the wedge top near $0.19 would, by contrast, postpone the bullish narrative and leave the post-breakout retest zone vulnerable. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.242.

A break above $345 could push AAVE to $360-$370. Failure to surpass $337 might result in a pullback towards the $300-$310 support zone. Aave 1-day price chart: AAVE tests key resistance after strong uptrend AAVE’s daily chart for July 18 shows a healthy 2.28% gain, with the coin riding a well-defined ascending trendline that has provided consistent support since late June. This upward trajectory has propelled AAVE from lows around $220 to current levels near $330. AAVEUSDT 1-day price chart | Source: Tradingview AAVE is approaching a critical horizontal resistance zone around $340-$345, which has historically been a ceiling for price action. The MACD indicator shows encouraging signs with the histogram trending positive and the signal line maintaining bullish momentum above the zero line. However, corrections might be in the waiting if AAVE fails to break past immediate resistance at $337. Aave 4-hour price chart: Consolidation emerges as bulls and bears battle The 4-hour chart shows a slight decline of 0.24% to $326.65, indicating intraday volatility around the $330 psychological level. The price action is seemingly forming a consolidation pattern above the 20-period simple moving average at $323.36, which continues to provide dynamic support for the current structure. AAVEUSDT 4-hour price chart | Source: Tradingview The Balance of Power indicator sits at -0.12, suggesting slight selling pressure has emerged, though not enough to trigger significant bearish momentum.

A break above $345 with strong volume could propel the token toward $360-$370 targets, while failure to hold current levels might trigger a pullback to $300-$310 support. Is AAVE a good investment?
