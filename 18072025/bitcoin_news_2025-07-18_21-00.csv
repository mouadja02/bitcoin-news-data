2025-07-18T18:45:50,"The Banks Are Up Against the Digital Asset Industry in a DC Policy Battle, and Crypto‚Äôs Been ‚ÄòWinning,‚Äô Says Custodia Bank CEO","The CEO of Custodia Bank, a US financial institution specializing in cryptocurrencies, says passing crypto legislation in the US has been a pitched battle between traditional banks and the digital asset industry. The House of Representatives this week passed the CLARITY Act, the GENIUS Act and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act. But only the GENIUS Act, which establishes the federal rules for stablecoins, has so far cleared both chambers of Congress. In an interview on CNBC, Custodia CEO Caitlin Long says that getting the crypto bills approved has been ‚Äúan ugly sausage-making process‚Äù that clashes traditional finance against the digital asset industries. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got some pretty powerful interests here. The banks are up against the crypto industry, and so far, the crypto industry has been winning.‚Äù Long says she is optimistic that the crypto industry has the upper hand because of the financial challenges that the US faces. ‚ÄúWhat problem is the government trying to solve? The US has enormous fiscal deficits and needs to have demand for purchasers of US Treasuries, and the crypto market would never have gotten permission, [though] some of us tried. Folks who went around the regulators and created entire new markets of buyers for US Treasuries, that‚Äôs what Congress and the Trump administration are trying to enable here.‚Äù Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat ‚Äì Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-18T18:41:09,"U.S. House of Representatives Sends GENIUS Act to Trump To Sign Into Law, Passes Two Other Bills To Conclude Crypto Week","The U.S. House of Representatives is closing the proclaimed Crypto Week with a bang, passing three monumental digital asset regulation bills. Yesterday, on a vote of 206-102, the Republican-led U.S. House passed the GENIUS Act, sending the country‚Äôs first crypto-specific regulations bill to the desk of the sitting President. GENIUS is an acronym meaning ‚ÄúGuiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins.‚Äù The bill purports to seek to improve consumer protection, transparency, marketing restrictions and regulatory oversight for the burgeoning stablecoin market, estimated to be worth $250 billion. Furthermore, the House passed the CLARITY and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Acts by similar margins, sending both bills to the Senate for further consideration. The CLARITY Act seeks to establish a clear regulation framework for crypto and other digital assets. The Anti-CBDC Act would prohibit Fed banks from issuing central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Though the GENIUS Act easily passed the House, prominent Republican Senator Josh Hawley has been vocal and adamant in breaking party lines on the bill, urging his fellow Republicans to vote against it. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a huge giveaway to Big Tech. It allows these tech companies to issue stablecoins without any kind of controls. I don‚Äôt see why we would do that.‚Äù Trump is expected to sign the GENIUS Act into law soon.
