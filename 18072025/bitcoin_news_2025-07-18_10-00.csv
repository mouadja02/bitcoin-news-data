Predictions suggest XRP could reach $5.05 by the end of 2025. Long-term projections show XRP could hit $26.50 by 2030 and $526 by 2050. XRP, one of the top five crypto assets, is gaining renewed traction as institutional adoption expands and its prolonged legal standoff nears resolution. Since President Trump returned to office, XRP has seen a surge in on-chain activity, bullish investor sentiment, and increasing chatter around a possible XRP ETF approval. In July 2025, XRP marked a new all-time high of $3.66 , coinciding with the launch of the ProShares Ultra XRP ETF , which is a milestone that further fueled optimism. With more asset managers eyeing approval and institutional capital flowing in, investors are now closely watching where XRP could head next in this evolving market landscape. With these developments in play, XRP price prediction is becoming a major focus for investors. Can XRP reach $100? Is a $500 target realistic in the long term? This article dives deep into XRP price prediction for 2025 and beyond through 2030.

We expect the XRP coin price to reach $5.81 in 2025. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.3 $4.89 $5.81 XRP Price Today Cryptocurrency XRP Token XRP Price $ 3.47423082 10.06% Market cap $ 205,612,588,271.99 Circulating Supply 59,182,189,917.00 Trading Volume $ 22,644,970,367.3233 All-time high $3.84 Jan 04, 2018 All-time low $0.002802 Jul 07, 2014 XRP Price Analysis 2025 (H1 2025) In the first half of 2025, the XRP price movement transitioned from a period of decline into a phase of consolidation. In Q2, XRP tested the upper boundary of a multi-month descending wedge at $2.65 around mid-May. However, it failed to hold above a crucial swing low support near $2.10, showing signs of limited upside momentum due to ongoing global tensions at that time. Investors were optimistic in Q2 about a positive legal catalyst around June 16, expecting a favorable update in the SEC lawsuit. Instead, the court issued a 60-day pause in appeals, leaving market sentiment hanging, which proves less momentum in price action. Even matters worsened when, in the first half’s last month, precisely on June 17, the SEC postponed the approval of Franklin Templeton’s XRP spot ETF, due to market instability amid geopolitical concerns. During the third weekend of June, the U.S. even fired airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, shaking the global markets. Even top assets like BTC, ETH, dropped, and XRP was no exception either, as it also dipped sharply to $1.94, as sentiment deteriorated. However, the announcement of a ceasefire in the fourth week of June helped the market bounce back, including XRP, and moving to July, bullish sentiment is evident in its price action. XRP Crypto Price Prediction July 2025 Starting June 23rd, the XRP price showed a sharp rebound from its low of $1.94 triggered by a ceasefire news between the US, Israel, and Iran. The bullish sentiment accelerated more on June 28, when Ripple’s CEO announced they were dropping the cross-appeal in the SEC case . Later, in early July, CLO Stuart Alderoty mentioned that the SEC has also officially ended a four-year legal battle by dropping its appeal against Ripple, too, providing major relief to XRP holders. Nate Geraci , president of The ETF Store, called Ripple’s move a pivotal moment. He even remarked that the odds of BlackRock jumping into XRP also increased. The ongoing July is filled with positive sentiment that continues to strengthen the XRP price. The investors have been engaged in a “buy-the-dip” mindset, and investor panic appeared to subside. In July, several more factors joined, like Grayscale added XRP to its Digital Large Cap Fund , and Ripple’s application for a U.S. banking license further boosted confidence and institutional trust in XRP. More developments that are supporting the ongoing bullish sentiment are due to the third week of July’s events, for instance, Ripple partners with Ctrl Alt and Dubai Land Department for tokenized real estate on XRP Ledger, which has boosted its utility. The top two major highlights of July is that ProShares launched the first XRP futures ETF on July 18; as a result, the XRP price spiked massively, and other one is that the key crypto bills are passed in the US House of Representatives, including the long-awaited GENIUS Act and CLARITY Act. This would boost legal clarity to digital assets like XRP, and the recent ETF Debut has increased hopes for other asset managers’ applications filed for spot XRP ETFs to be approved before year-end. On the chart, the entire rally appears like a breakout from the upper resistance of the falling wedge pattern. The gains that are displayed from June’s third week to when writing is nearly 85%, and the day it breached $2.40 in July second week it surged more than 60%. This breakout was catalyzed by Bitcoin’s new all-time high of $123,231, which pulled altcoins like XRP upward. XRP has now entered a price discovery with a recent ATH marked at $3.66. Similarly, from a technical indicators perspective, XRP price golden cross between its 20-day and 50-day EMAs has expanded. The MACD also shows a golden cross between the MACD line and the signal line, with a strong histogram at 0.1178. This indicates strength in bullish momentum, which is evident in AO too, which is at 0.7373. ncreased exchange outflows, and whale transactions are driving liquidity into the asset. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator has surged to 0.24, up from 0.04 earlier in early july, highlighting growing accumulation and surging money inflow. However, there are warning signals to consider, which alarm short-term caution with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 89, indicating overheated overbought conditions. A short-term pullback or sideways consolidation is likely before the next leg upward. On the contrary, if XRP price fails to hold the $3.40 support, a retest of $2.95 is possible. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High June 2025 $1.95 $3.00 $4.00 XRP Price Prediction 2025 Moreover, XRP has partnered with Wormhole to utilize its phenomenal cross-chain interoperability. Through this road in development, they seek a real-world adoption to boost. Therefore, consistent developments and crucial partnerships, If XRP manages to break above its all-time high of $3.40 in July 2025, after clearing the high-volume resistance zone at $2.40. Then odds are high that it could realistically target $5 by year-end. This potential rally would likely be fueled by growing optimism from banks, institutional investors, and the possibility of ETF approval which has highest odds in H2 of 2025. Source: TokenTerminal Adding to the bullish case, Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, is now integrated into its Ripple Payments system, and it is performing well per data from the token terminal. The transfer count has surged from 242 transfer counts to 3.1K transfer counts, holders count surged from 818 to 3.3K, and transfer volume grew from $88 million to $694 million, further solidifying its role in global finance. Notably, institutional dominance is strong as per coincarp , with the top 100 addresses holding 70% of XRP’s circulating supply, which is positioning XRP as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.

Ripple (XRP) Price Projection 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Based on historic price sentiments and XRP’s rising popularity, here are the XRP future price projections for 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, and 2050.

Yes, XRP is still a good investment for those with a long-term view. With the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit nearing settlement, increasing institutional interest, and rising on-chain activity, XRP’s fundamentals remain strong. The integration of RLUSD and potential ETF listings further boosts its utility and market potential. While short-term volatility may persist, XRP price prediction models point to significant upside. If regulatory clarity continues, XRP could be well-positioned to reach ambitious targets like $100—or even higher—in the coming years. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-18T07:52:31,"CoinFutures Review: New High Leverage Trading Platform","CoinFutures is a crypto futures trading platform with a gamified approach to crypto futures trading. Developed by the makers of CoinPoker, the platform has generated quite a bit of buzz within the cryptocurrency community thanks to its leveraged trading capabilities without asking for any KYC details. The purpose of this article is to highlight the key features of CoinFutures and how it stacks up against the needs of the modern trader who has become ever more inclined to jump into crypto during the current bull cycle. What is CoinFutures? The official website gives a small and clear definition of the platform as a system where users can earn based on their correct price prediction of their favorite assets. Investors can either give a “short” prediction, believing that the asset’s value will drop, or go “long” if they believe the asset could surge in the long term. Features like “cash out before the bust” are highlights of this platform, essentially allowing investors to withdraw before the market turns negative. The platform, powered by AI-driven smart algorithms, mirrors current volatile macroeconomic conditions to offer users a trade-like experience without the complexities of real trading. In simple terms, CoinFutures offers a gamified approach to crypto trading without involving complexities such as wallets or exchanges. How One Can Trade Crypto Futures on CoinFutures? Regardless of how easy CoinFutures makes the prospect of trading crypto futures sound, there are some innate complexities present. That said, the website has provided instructions (in clear terms, no less) on how the entire system works. Picking a Cryptocurrency CoinFutures instructs that users must first pick a cryptocurrency. The options available are many, with Bitcoin and Ethereum being the top two choices. For now, however, the options are limited, with the only other assets including Dogecoin, Tron, and Litecoin. But CoinFutures promises that more will be added in the future. Picking an asset will reveal the crypto’s price charts, which will be instrumental in deciding the options in the next step. Predicting an Asset’s Price Action Investors (or in this case, players) will then have to predict whether the price of an asset will go up or down. The options available are simple, with little up and down buttons provided to simplify the process. Selecting the Price and Multiplier Investors must then select the price point the asset is likely to hit. Manual inputs are available, but if the predictions are general, a simple scroll option lets investors add or subtract the price. Choosing a multiplier is also an option. It is said to amplify the prediction. Similar to standard leveraged trading, this protocol involves high risk and high rewards. Placing the Prediction and Cashing Out After placing the prediction, investors can look at the price chart to keep tabs on whether their prediction is likely to pan out. Because CoinFutures is flexible, it also allows investors to cash out quickly if the market is turning against them or going “bust”. What Factors Make CoinFutures a Suitable Platform? CoinFutures offers a unique approach to crypto futures trading. It isn’t complex and relies on gamification, going as far as portraying investors as “players” and the entire ecosystem as betting. This trait alone makes it fit for those who think of the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem as akin to a game. Secondly, the price chart shows simulated real crypto volatility, while also allowing investors to amplify their bets with up to a 1000x multiplier. This strategy lets players tap into the volatile markets and leverage the high-risk, high-reward paradigm to earn large returns. Despite the gamified approach, CoinFutures’ crypto futures trading style isn’t bereft of strategic depth. Players abreast of market conditions could gain an edge when predicting. While veteran crypto enthusiasts can stick to manual mode, less confident players wanting to manage risks can opt for auto-mode instead. This mode lets players set a stop-loss and take-profit level. All of these features wouldn’t be as effective without a strong user interface, which CoinFutures provides. It has the same CoinPoker-esque approach to design: simple, unique, and yet stylish. All the options are clearly provided, and the additional data about other players’ bets adds another layer to the strategic element of this “trading game.” For those who prefer anonymity, CoinFutures’ no-KYC approach is also an aspect worth highlighting. Payment Options Available on CoinFutures Although CoinFutures revels in being a crypto-centric ecosystem, the payment options available make it accessible to all.

2025-07-18T07:42:17,"Donald Trump’s New  Executive Order Could Add Crypto to 401(k) Retirement Accounts","The post Donald Trump’s New Executive Order Could Add Crypto to 401(k) Retirement Accounts appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News President Donald Trump is reportedly preparing to sign an executive order that could open U.S. retirement plans, known as 401(k)s, to cryptocurrency and other alternative assets. The move could drastically change how nearly $9 trillion in retirement savings are managed and allocated. A New Direction for 401(k) Investments According to a Financial Times report , the executive order may be signed as early as this week. It would direct Washington regulators to explore pathways for allowing 401(k) accounts to include crypto assets, metals, infrastructure funds, and even private equity and loans. Traditionally, these retirement accounts have been limited to stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. This plan builds on momentum gained earlier this year, when the Department of Labor under Trump’s influence reversed Biden-era guidance that discouraged the inclusion of cryptocurrencies in retirement plans. Financial giant Fidelity also introduced a new retirement account in April that includes crypto options, further hinting at institutional appetite for such changes. Official Yet Unconfirmed While the executive order seems imminent, Trump’s camp has emphasized that nothing is official yet. White House spokesman Kush Desai told the media that any decision must come directly from Trump himself. However, he reiterated the president’s commitment to enhancing financial opportunities for everyday Americans. Big Institutions Preparing Major financial firms are already preparing for this potential shift. Companies like Blackstone, BlackRock, and Apollo are reportedly working on private market offerings tailored for retirement investors. Partnerships with major 401(k) providers such as Vanguard and Empower are also underway, setting the stage for rapid adoption if the order goes through. With over $8.9 trillion held in U.S. retirement accounts, even a small percentage allocated to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum would significantly boost market liquidity and long-term price stability. Global Impact If finalized, the U.S. wouldn’t be alone in this move. Countries like Japan and the UK have already begun considering or allocating small portions of pension funds to Bitcoin. This global trend shows increasing comfort with crypto as a long-term investment vehicle. For now, all eyes are on Trump. If the order is signed, it could mark a major milestone in crypto adoption, one that integrates digital assets into the heart of American financial planning. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-18T07:20:05,"Revolutionary OpenAI ChatGPT Agent Unleashes Unprecedented Automation","BitcoinWorld Revolutionary OpenAI ChatGPT Agent Unleashes Unprecedented Automation In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, where innovation is key, a groundbreaking development from OpenAI is poised to capture the attention of tech enthusiasts and professionals alike. The company has officially launched a new general-purpose ChatGPT agent , a sophisticated AI tool designed to fundamentally change how users interact with their computers and manage their daily tasks. This isn’t just another chatbot; it’s a bold step towards truly intelligent automation, promising to offload a wide array of computer-based tasks directly within ChatGPT. What Can OpenAI’s New ChatGPT Agent Do For You? OpenAI’s latest offering, dubbed the ChatGPT agent , is engineered to handle a diverse range of complex computer-based operations. Imagine an intelligent assistant that doesn’t just answer questions but actively performs tasks across your digital environment. This agent combines and enhances capabilities seen in OpenAI’s earlier experimental tools, such as ‘Operator’ for web navigation and ‘Deep Research’ for synthesizing information. Here’s a glimpse into the transformative capabilities of this powerful AI agent : Seamless Calendar Management: Automatically navigate and update your digital calendar, scheduling meetings or reminders based on your prompts. Dynamic Presentation Generation: Create editable presentations and slideshows from your instructions, saving countless hours on manual design. Robust Code Execution: Run code directly within its environment, offering unparalleled utility for developers and data scientists. Intelligent Web Navigation: Leverage ‘Operator’s’ ability to click around websites, gather specific information, and interact with online interfaces on your behalf. Comprehensive Research Synthesis: Utilize ‘Deep Research’ capabilities to synthesize vast amounts of information from dozens of websites into concise, actionable reports. The beauty of the ChatGPT agent lies in its simplicity of interaction. Users can engage with it using natural language prompts, making advanced automation accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical expertise. This intuitive approach is central to OpenAI’s vision of widespread productivity enhancement. How Does This AI Agent Enhance Your Productivity ? The core promise of the ChatGPT agent is a significant boost in user productivity through intelligent automation . By offloading routine, time-consuming, or complex digital tasks, it frees up users to focus on higher-level, creative, and strategic work. This shift from passive interaction (asking questions) to active task execution (performing actions) marks a pivotal moment in AI development. The agent is rolling out to OpenAI’s Pro, Plus, and Team plan subscribers. Activating this powerful tool is straightforward: simply select ‘agent mode’ from ChatGPT’s dropdown menu of tools. This ease of access ensures that a broad base of users can immediately begin to experience the benefits of this advanced AI agent . Connecting Your World: Enhanced Capabilities and Integrations What truly sets the new ChatGPT agent apart are its expanded connectivity options. OpenAI has equipped it with ‘ChatGPT connectors,’ allowing seamless integration with popular applications. This means the agent can access relevant information from your personal and professional digital ecosystem: Gmail Integration: Imagine the agent sifting through your emails to find specific information for a report or drafting replies based on context. GitHub Access: For developers, the ability to connect to GitHub means the agent can potentially assist with code reviews, repository management, or even debugging by accessing your projects. Furthermore, the ChatGPT agent has access to a terminal and can utilize APIs to interact with a broader range of applications. This level of access signifies a powerful leap, moving beyond mere information retrieval to direct, actionable engagement with diverse software environments. This capability is crucial for unlocking truly transformative automation workflows. Benchmarking Excellence: A Leap in Automation Performance OpenAI asserts that the model underpinning the ChatGPT agent delivers state-of-the-art performance across several critical benchmarks, showcasing its superior capabilities compared to previous iterations and competitors. This isn’t just incremental improvement; it represents a significant jump in AI’s ability to tackle complex, multi-faceted problems. Consider the following performance metrics: Benchmark Test ChatGPT Agent (with tools) OpenAI’s o3/o4-mini (previous) Humanity’s Last Exam (pass@1) 41.6% ~20% (roughly double) FrontierMath (with tools) 27.4% 6.3% The ‘Humanity’s Last Exam’ is a notoriously difficult test comprising thousands of questions across over a hundred subjects.

2025-07-18T07:10:29,"SharpLink Gaming Adds Another $115M in ETH Amid Bull Run, Total Holdings Reach 353K ETH","SharpLink Gaming has purchased an additional 32,892 Ethereum worth $115 million in the past three hours, bringing the company’s total accumulation to 144,501 ETH, valued at $515 million over the past nine days, as the cryptocurrency surges to six-month highs above $3,400. The Minneapolis-based online performance marketing company has emerged as the world’s largest corporate holder of Ethereum, surpassing the Ethereum Foundation with approximately 353,000 ETH, worth over $1.2 billion. SharpLink is Accumulating Aggressively The aggressive accumulation strategy began in late May following a $425 million private placement led by Consensys . Since then, SharpLink’s stock (SBET) has risen 29% amid the buying spree. At the time of writing, the stock is trading at $36.40 per share. The stock has increased roughly sixfold since the ETH treasury pivot several weeks ago. Source: Yahoo Finance The company has allocated 99.7% of its ETH holdings to staking protocols, generating approximately 415 ETH in rewards since June while supporting Ethereum network security. This dual-purpose strategy allows SharpLink to earn additional yield while participating in proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms. Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin, who chairs SharpLink’s board and leads Consensys, described the firm’s approach as a public-market proxy for Ethereum exposure similar to MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy. The company’s positioning capitalizes on Ethereum’s programmable nature and yield-generating capabilities, which extend beyond simple price appreciation. Corporate Treasury Revolution Follows MicroStrategy Bitcoin Playbook SharpLink’s Ethereum accumulation follows the model pioneered by Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy, which has amassed $67 billion in Bitcoin since 2020. The strategy involves converting traditional cash reserves into cryptocurrency holdings to serve as the primary treasury reserve asset. The company described Ethereum as “ the base layer of the future global economy ” while committing to long-term holding and staking strategies. The transformation began after SharpLink raised approximately $425 million through private placement and at-the-market equity sales. Proceeds were earmarked explicitly for Ethereum purchases rather than traditional business expansion, establishing ETH as the company’s primary reserve asset. According Lookonchain, SharpLink has bought another 20,279 Ethereum (ETH) on Thursday, worth $68.38 million. #SharpLink #EthereumStrategy #ETH https://t.co/mrCYHV8jWc — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 17, 2025 One notable transaction involved SharpLink purchasing 10,000 ETH directly from the Ethereum Foundation for $25.7 million, executed through the Foundation’s multisig wallet. The direct purchase approach bypassed traditional exchanges and OTC desks. Between July 7 and July 18, SharpLink purchased 134,204 ETH at an average price of $2,970, totaling $398.66 million in investments. The company has consistently acquired tens of millions of dollars worth of ETH daily, according to Lubin’s statements to CNBC . Institutional Ethereum Adoption Accelerates Across Multiple Sectors The corporate Ethereum adoption trend extends beyond SharpLink to multiple publicly traded companies seeking alternatives to traditional cash management. For instance, Bit Digital completed its transformation into an Ethereum treasury company by selling 280 BTC and deploying $172 million to accumulate over 100,000 ETH. Similarly, GameSquare Holdings announced a $100 million ETH treasury allocation through a phased investment strategy targeting yields of 8-14%, which is significantly higher than the standard ETH staking returns of 3-4%. The media and entertainment firm priced an $8 million public offering to fund the initiative. Ethereum ETFs surge past $5.5 billion in record inflows with BlackRock's ETHA leading $489 million single-day purchase as analysts target $4,000 ETH breakthrough. #Ethereum #ETF https://t.co/GhWI8qwdnc — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 17, 2025 Notably, Ethereum ETFs have crossed $5.5 billion in total inflows since debut , with BlackRock’s ETHA achieving record single-day inflows of $489 million on July 17. The institutional momentum has driven Ethereum to six-month highs above $3,400 as demand significantly exceeds available supply. ETFs currently manage 5 million ETH, representing 4.02% of Ethereum’s $413 billion market capitalization. Ethereum-focused treasuries hold $5.3 billion worth of ETH and acquire tokens at rates 36 times the daily ETH production rate. Corporate adoption appears concentrated among companies seeking yield advantages over Bitcoin’s store-of-value proposition. Over 35 million ETH tokens are currently staked, representing more than 28% of the total supply locked in smart contracts, generating passive income. In fact, World Liberty Financial, affiliated with President Trump, recently acquired $4.99 million worth of ETH, while multiple companies have announced plans to raise hundreds of millions for Ethereum treasury strategies. The SEC’s relaxed stance on staking-as-a-service enforcement has encouraged institutional adoption without regulatory concerns.

Key Takeaways: Dave Portnoy regrets selling most of his XRP early, missing out on millions. XRP’s recent rally triggered $68 million in short position liquidations amid a broader crypto market surge. The crypto market rally follows key US legislative wins. In a video posted to X , Portnoy said, “I would’ve made millions, and I want to cry. I don’t own it anymore, even though I was the leader of the XRP army.” XRP recently broke through its yearly high of $3.29 and surged to $3.60, marking a 19.61% gain in the past 24 hours, according to data from Nansen. Portnoy Sold XRP at $2.40 After Warning About Circle Competition Portnoy revealed he sold XRP when the price reached $2.40, influenced by someone who warned him about competition from stablecoin issuer Circle. Ripple Labs, the company behind XRP, applied for a national bank charter in the US on July 2, just two days after Circle filed for the same. At the Consensus 2025 conference, Portnoy admitted he lacked a strong conviction in XRP, purchasing it out of fear of missing out (FOMO), hoping it might become the next Bitcoin.

The figure corresponds to nearly 2.9 billion XRP in open contracts. The previous record for XRP notional open interest stood at $8.3 billion, which was hit in late January before the start of former U.S. President Donald Trump’s second term. Across most venues, XRP’s funding rate was positive and climbing, signaling a market where longs are willing to pay shorts to maintain positions, a classic indicator of bullish sentiment. As reported, the number of wallets holding at least 1 million XRP tokens has also surged to an all-time high . Data shows that wallets holding 1 million or more XRP collectively control over 47.32 billion tokens.

2025-07-18T07:00:45,"Revolutionary AI Privacy Solution: Confident Security Secures $4.2M for Unrivaled Data Protection","BitcoinWorld Revolutionary AI Privacy Solution: Confident Security Secures $4.2M for Unrivaled Data Protection The rapid ascent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been nothing short of transformative, promising unparalleled efficiency and innovation across every sector imaginable. Yet, beneath the surface of this technological marvel lies a significant concern that resonates deeply within the cryptocurrency community: AI privacy . Just as blockchain technology champions decentralization and user control over data, the centralized nature of many AI models raises red flags regarding data handling. As individuals, businesses, and even governments enthusiastically embrace the seemingly magical capabilities of AI, a critical question consistently emerges: How can we truly safeguard our sensitive information? The Growing AI Privacy Challenge Tech behemoths like OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, and Google are quietly, yet consistently, collecting and retaining vast amounts of user data. This practice is often justified for model improvement or security monitoring. However, even in enterprise environments, where companies typically assume their information is protected, this data collection can occur without explicit, transparent consent. For industries under strict regulatory scrutiny, such as healthcare, finance, and government, this ambiguous data landscape is not just a concern; it’s a potential deal-breaker. Fears about the destination of data, its accessibility, and its potential misuse are demonstrably slowing the broader AI adoption in these critical sectors. The very promise of AI is hindered by a fundamental lack of trust in its underlying data infrastructure. Introducing Confident Security: The Signal for AI Amidst these growing concerns, a San Francisco-based startup, Confident Security , has emerged from stealth with a powerful vision: to become “the Signal for AI.” This ambitious goal positions them as a beacon of trust and privacy in the burgeoning AI ecosystem. The company recently announced a significant milestone, securing a substantial $4.2 million in seed funding. This investment, exclusively learned by Bitcoin World, comes from prominent venture capital firms including Decibel, South Park Commons, Ex Ante, and Swyx, underscoring the market’s urgent need for robust AI privacy solutions. How CONFSEC Delivers End-to-End Encryption Confident Security’s flagship product, CONFSEC, is engineered to provide an unparalleled level of data protection. At its core, CONFSEC is an end-to-end encryption tool designed to encapsulate foundational AI models. This innovative wrapper ensures that all prompts and associated metadata remain entirely private, guaranteeing that they cannot be stored, viewed, or utilized for AI training purposes by the model provider or any third party. This commitment to privacy addresses the core anxiety of AI users. Jonathan Mortensen, founder and CEO of Confident Security, articulated the company’s philosophy to Bitcoin World, stating, “The second that you give up your data to someone else, you’ve essentially reduced your privacy. And our product’s goal is to remove that trade-off.” This statement perfectly encapsulates the mission: to empower AI users with the confidence that their data remains their own. CONFSEC’s operational framework is ingeniously modeled after Apple’s Private Cloud Compute (PCC) architecture, which Mortensen praises as “10x better than anything out there in terms of guaranteeing that Apple cannot see your data” during secure cloud-based AI tasks. This inspiration highlights a commitment to best-in-class privacy standards. The system operates through a sophisticated, multi-layered process: Data Anonymization: Initially, data is anonymized through encryption and routed via trusted services like Cloudflare or Fastly. This crucial first step ensures that servers never gain visibility into the original source or content of the data, immediately establishing a layer of anonymity. Advanced Conditional Decryption: Next, CONFSEC employs advanced encryption techniques that permit decryption only under highly restrictive, predefined conditions. Mortensen elaborated on this, explaining, “So you can say you’re only allowed to decrypt this if you are not going to log the data, and you’re not going to use it for training, and you’re not going to let anyone see it.” This granular control over data access is revolutionary. Transparent Verification: Finally, the software responsible for AI inference is publicly logged and made open for review. This transparency allows independent experts to verify and confirm that the system’s privacy guarantees are rigorously upheld, fostering trust through auditable processes. Unlocking AI Adoption in Sensitive Sectors Confident Security positions itself as a vital intermediary vendor between AI providers and their diverse clientele, including hyperscalers, governments, and large enterprises. Mortensen believes that even the major AI companies themselves could benefit significantly from offering Confident Security’s tool to their enterprise clients. This strategic move would not only enhance their service offerings but also unlock vast new markets that are currently hesitant due to privacy concerns. By integrating CONFSEC, AI vendors can provide the ironclad guarantees necessary for highly regulated industries to confidently embrace AI. Furthermore, CONFSEC is particularly well-suited for the new wave of AI browsers entering the market, such as Perplexity’s recently launched Comet. These browsers often handle sensitive user queries, and CONFSEC can provide customers with invaluable assurances that their private data is not being stored on a server where it could be accessed by the company or malicious actors. It also alleviates the legitimate fear that work-related prompts might inadvertently be used to “train AI to do your job,” a concern that resonates deeply with professionals across various industries. Jess Leao, a partner at Decibel, underscored the critical importance of Confident Security’s mission in a statement: “Confident Security is ahead of the curve in recognizing that the future of AI depends on trust built into the infrastructure itself. Without solutions like this, many enterprises simply can’t move forward with AI.” This sentiment highlights the transformative potential of CONFSEC in accelerating responsible AI adoption . Ensuring Unparalleled Data Security for AI In today’s digital landscape, the phrase “ data security ” often conjures images of firewalls and antivirus software. However, in the realm of AI, data security takes on a new, more intricate dimension. It’s not just about preventing external breaches, but also about controlling internal access and usage by the very entities providing the AI service. Confident Security’s approach is holistic, ensuring that data remains secure throughout its entire lifecycle within the AI interaction – from prompt submission to model inference. The company, though only a year old, has already made significant strides. Mortensen confirmed that CONFSEC has undergone rigorous testing, external audits, and is now fully production-ready. This meticulous preparation demonstrates Confident Security’s commitment to delivering a robust and reliable solution. The team is actively engaged in discussions with a wide range of potential clients, including major banks, internet browsers, and search engines, all keen to integrate CONFSEC into their existing infrastructure stacks. The message is clear and compelling: “You bring the AI, we bring the privacy,” as Mortensen succinctly puts it. The Road Ahead: Building Trust in AI The emergence of Confident Security signifies a pivotal moment in the evolution of artificial intelligence. As AI capabilities continue to expand at an astonishing pace, the focus is shifting from merely what AI can do, to how it can be done responsibly and securely. Trust is the bedrock upon which widespread AI innovation will be built, particularly in sectors where data sensitivity is paramount. Confident Security’s solution provides a crucial piece of this puzzle, offering a tangible mechanism for enterprises and governments to leverage AI’s power without compromising their most valuable asset: their data. By prioritizing privacy by design and offering verifiable guarantees, Confident Security is not just selling a product; it’s cultivating a new standard for AI interaction. This commitment to transparency and user control is vital for fostering confidence and accelerating the ethical deployment of AI across all industries. The company’s early success and strategic partnerships suggest a bright future, where AI’s transformative potential can be fully realized, hand-in-hand with robust privacy protections.

2025-07-18T07:00:37,"XRP MVRV Ratio Flashes Signal That Last Led To 630% Surge","An analyst has pointed out that the XRP Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio has just formed a crossover that proved to be highly bullish the last time it appeared. XRP MVRV Ratio Has Broken Above Its 200-Day MA In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a crossover that has recently occurred in the MVRV Ratio of XRP. The “MVRV Ratio” is a popular on-chain indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the asset’s Market Cap and Realized Cap. The Realized Cap here refers to a capitalization model that calculates the cryptocurrency’s total value by assuming that the value of each coin in circulation is equal to the price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain. This is unlike the Market Cap, which simply takes the current spot price as the same one value for all coins. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Influx Of New Capital: First-Time Buyers Add 140,000 BTC The last transfer of any token is likely to represent the last time it changed hands, so the price at its time can be denoted as its current cost basis. As such, the Realized Cap represents the sum of the cost basis of the entire circulating supply. One way to interpret the model is as a measure of the amount of capital that the investors as a whole have stored in the cryptocurrency. The Market Cap, on the other hand, signifies the value that the holders are carrying in the present. When the value of the MVRV Ratio is more than 1, it means the Market Cap is greater than the Realized Cap. In other words, the investors are holding more than they put in. On the other hand, the metric being under this threshold suggests the overall network is underwater. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the trend in the XRP MVRV Ratio, as well as its 200-day moving average (MA), over the past year: As displayed in the above graph, the XRP MVRV Ratio has seen a sharp surge recently as the asset’s breakout has occurred. With this uptrend, the indicator has managed to break past its 200-day MA. In the chart, the analyst has highlighted the last time that the cryptocurrency’s MVRV Ratio and its 200-day MA showed this type of crossover. What followed back then was a significant bull run in which the coin managed to rise by around 630%. Related Reading: XRP Close Above This Level Could Send Price To $4.80, Analyst Says Given this precedence, it now remains to be seen whether the latest crossover will also prove to be a golden one for XRP.
