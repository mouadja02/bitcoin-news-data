2025-07-18T03:39:48,"XRP Price Prediction Today As Ripple Hits New ATH","The post XRP Price Prediction Today As Ripple Hits New ATH appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP jumped to $3.62, crossing its recent peak of $3.40, after the U.S. House of Representatives passed three major crypto bills, including the Genius Act. The bill is set to bring clear rules for digital assets and will now head to Donald Trump for final approval. XRP price has officially broken past its previous all-time high of $3.40, hitting a new peak at $3.65 after a 20% rise. Now that XRP has broken above $3.40, a stronger rally could follow, with price targets at $3.80, $4.33, and even $4.72 in the coming weeks. On the downside, any rejection could pull XRP back toward the $2.90‚Äì$3.00 support zone. However, as long as XRP holds above this level, the bullish trend remains intact. Fueled by institutional interest, retail FOMO, and a broad crypto market rally, XRP‚Äôs bullish trend shows little sign of slowing. Why XRP Is Running Hard Liquidity Surge: Crypto markets have seen over $500B in capital return over the past two weeks, pushing Bitcoin to $123K and Ethereum to $3.4K. Lawsuit Settled: The Ripple vs. SEC case is largely behind us, with both sides having agreed to terms. ETF Speculation: Hopes for a U.S.-approved XRP ETF are growing, with odds over 85% by year-end. Institutional Buying: Big money is moving in‚Äîadoption of Ripple‚Äôs technology is increasing behind the scenes. Retail Buying Spree: Small investors are piling in, accelerating gains further with classic bull cycle behavior. Short-Term Outlook With XRP already at $3.62, a push to $5 by the end of July is no longer far-fetched. However, some profit-taking could cool the rally briefly, especially if XRP hits $3.80 .",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-prediction-today-as-ripple-hits-new-ath/,"XRP|TRADING|MARKET|BTC|BUSINESS","News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

2025-07-18T03:23:21,"XRP Skyrockets to New All-Time High and Analysts Believe It‚Äôs Just Getting Started","TL;DR The native token of the Ripple ecosystem has joined the likes of bitcoin by setting a new all-time high, a moment seven years in the making. A popular analyst who recently predicted the price surge said this is just the beginning. XRPUSD. Source: TradingView XRP‚Äôs all-time high is somewhat a controversial topic within the community, as different exchanges and data aggregators provide contrasting numbers. However, on most exchanges we could check, XRP blasted past the previous peak, which, according to CoinGecko, was set at $3.4. Data from CG now shows that the new record is at over $3.6, something that Coinbase, Binance, and Bitstamp concur. The XRP Army is also enjoying the moment, with big celebrations on X with multiple ‚ÄúI told you sos‚Äù and further massive price predictions. The market capitalization has also set a new record, somewhat expectedly, at beyond $210 billion. Ali Martinez, who indicated last week when XRP struggled at $2.2 that the asset is about to rip and most traders will miss it, also weighed in on the matter. The analyst with roughly $140,000 followers on X praised the move and outlined a certain metric that suggests further gains are around the corner. Previously, he noted that if XRP manages to close above $3 and break its all-time high, it could shoot up to $4.8. $XRP just hit a new all-time high and it‚Äôs just getting started! https://t.co/oPBcTCx4hV ‚Äî Ali (@ali_charts) July 17, 2025 The post XRP Skyrockets to New All-Time High and Analysts Believe It‚Äôs Just Getting Started appeared first on CryptoPotato .",cryptopotato,https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-skyrockets-to-new-all-time-high-and-analysts-believe-its-just-getting-started/,"XRP|EXCHANGE|TRADING|BNB|BTC","Crypto Bits|Crypto News|XRPBTC|XRPUSD|Ripple (XRP) Price",cryptocompare

2025-07-18T03:00:56,"BlockDAG‚Äôs NO VESTING PASS Offers Full Access as BONK Hits $507M & TAO Eyes $779 in 2025","Bitcoin‚Äôs recent record price is sparking fresh energy across the crypto landscape. Riding this momentum, Bittensor (TAO) is gaining traction as experts forecast a sharp climb toward $779 by 2025, powered by its AI-based model. BONK is also heating up, with strong trading activity and record-setting launchpad revenue placing it back in the spotlight. At the same time, BlockDAG has launched a NO VESTING PASS that unlocks 100% of purchased coins at launch, only 8 days remain.This comes with a discounted price of $0.0016 and has already pushed BlockDAG past the $340.5 million funding mark. Early batches have seen 2,660% returns, positioning BDAG as a top crypto coin to buy now. Bittensor Price Prediction: $779 Forecast as AI Demand Rises Bittensor (TAO) is in the spotlight again, especially after attracting $17.5 million in backing from major firms since June 2025. The current price is near $437, but analysts predict it could climb to $779 in 2025 and possibly soar to $5,915 by 2030. This outlook stems from TAO‚Äôs innovative model, where daily rewards go directly to subnet builders creating AI applications inside its system. As AI adoption grows, Bittensor‚Äôs real-world use cases keep expanding. While there are still some risks from regulatory issues or market volatility, many believe the project has room to grow. Its AI-linked structure gives it staying power, with continued attention from crypto followers focused on long-term growth. BONK Price Forecast: $507M Activity Pushes New Targets BONK has been on an upward trend, gaining nearly 20% in the past week and trading around $0.000027. Market watchers are closely monitoring its rise as BONK‚Äôs launchpad posted $7.97 million in revenue in just one week, more than all other Solana launchpads combined. Its open interest has now topped $507 million, showing growing momentum and rising trader confidence. Looking ahead, analysts believe $0.000034 is the next resistance level. Technical indicators such as RSI and MACD remain bullish, though the overbought reading may signal a small correction before another move upward. Still, BONK‚Äôs volume and community backing make it one of the more active memecoins right now. BlockDAG‚Äôs Limited-time NO VESTING PASS Deal Adds Urgency to $340.5M Surge As Bitcoin reaches new highs, BlockDAG‚Äôs move to introduce a 10-day NO VESTING PASS is hitting the market at just the right moment. This unique offer lets buyers unlock 100% of the BDAG coins they purchase during this short window. While bonus coins remain locked, all regular purchases are fully accessible at launch, no delays, no partial unlocks. That‚Äôs a major shift in a space where most launches include long lock-up periods. This clear structure is helping BlockDAG attract attention fast. It has already raised over $340.5 million in presale and sold 23.9 billion coins. Buyers in earlier batches have seen gains of up to 2,660%, measured against the current Batch 29 price of $0.0276. Now, with BDAG priced at just $0.0016 until August 11, there‚Äôs a final shot to secure a steep discount before the price rises to the official $0.05 launch rate. That difference could mean a possible 3,025% return if targets are met. This short window, paired with full access, is rare in the crypto space. As interest builds and more coins get locked in daily, BlockDAG is shaping up to be a must-watch project. For anyone tracking the top crypto coins to buy now, BDAG is emerging as a serious contender. Summing It Up The crypto market is showing real movement again. Bittensor (TAO) is riding the AI wave with projections hitting $779, while BONK is gaining fast thanks to strong launchpad returns and a $507 million open interest. But it‚Äôs BlockDAG that‚Äôs creating the biggest shake-up. The 10-day NO VESTING PASS, the $0.0016 entry point, and its $340.5 million milestone make it hard to ignore. With 23.9 billion coins already sold and full access guaranteed at launch, the project offers a rare edge. If the question is which crypto coins to buy now, TAO, BONK, and BlockDAG each bring a powerful angle, but BDAG‚Äôs offer makes it the most immediate play.

2025-07-18T03:00:15,"Whales? No, Newbies: Surge In New BTC Holders Fuels Market Rally‚ÄîStudy","Bitcoin has been on a tear lately. Prices jumped past $123,000 this week. Now, new figures show that fresh money is flowing into the market again. That‚Äôs a sharp change after months of muted retail interest. Related Reading: Avalanche Shatters Record With 20M Transactions‚ÄîIs Real-World Use Finally Here? Fresh Capital Flooding In According to on‚Äëchain data from Glassnode, first‚Äëtime buyers picked up an extra 140,000‚ÄØBTC over the past two weeks. Their holdings climbed from 4.77‚ÄØmillion to nearly 5 million BTC‚Äîa 2.86% rise. That influx of fresh coins helped push Bitcoin past its latest high. It also shows that new investors are gaining confidence in the world‚Äôs biggest cryptocurrency. Over the past two weeks, the supply held by first-time $BTC buyers rose by +2.86%, climbing from 4.77M to 4.91M #BTC. Fresh capital continues to enter the market, supporting the latest price breakout. pic.twitter.com/W95HSAMaHI ‚Äî glassnode (@glassnode) July 17, 2025 Short‚ÄëTerm Holders Hit A New Cost Base Newer players aren‚Äôt the only ones getting active. Based on reports, entities that bought Bitcoin within the last six months now sit on a cost basis above $100,000 for the first time. They‚Äôve held on through price swings and have not yet sold at a loss. That suggests many expect the rally to continue. At the same time, holding on tight could create pressure if prices dip below their average buy‚Äëin point. Dip Buyers Act Fast Glassnode‚Äôs cost‚Äëbasis heatmap revealed that buyers moved quickly when Bitcoin dipped below $116,000 earlier this week. About 196,600‚ÄØBTC changed hands between $116,000 and $118,000. That buying spree added over $23 million in value near what looks like a local top. It‚Äôs a sign of strong resolve from those backing the market at lower levels. Altcoin Chat Outpaces Bitcoin Searches While whales and newer buyers are busy, the crowd on Google seems less thrilled. Search activity for ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äù ticked up modestly in the last fortnight, but it‚Äôs well below the highs seen when BTC first broke $100,000 this year. At the same time, data from Santiment indicate chatter has shifted toward altcoins. With Ethereum grabbing the spotlight, many retail investors appear more excited by tokens promising bigger short‚Äëterm moves. Related Reading: If You‚Äôre Wealthy, 1 Bitcoin Should Already Be In Your Wallet, Expert Says Retail Interest Remains Muted Despite soaring prices, everyday investors haven‚Äôt jumped back in en masse. Based on reports, the broad public‚Äôs FOMO hasn‚Äôt shown up in a big way yet. That lack of widespread buzz could limit how far and how fast Bitcoin goes from here. In past rallies, it was the flood of curiosity from casual buyers that turned spikes into parabolic runs.
