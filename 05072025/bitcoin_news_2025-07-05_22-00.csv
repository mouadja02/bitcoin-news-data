In a new thread on the social media platform X, Timmer says that based on a historical relationship between Bitcoin and the global money supply metric the top digital asset by soon print new all-time highs. ‚ÄúWith both liquidity improving per the global money supply and the stock market reaching new highs, it‚Äôs no surprise that Bitcoin is on the move again. Both Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde are being supported for now, and Bitcoin should be at new all-time highs soon enough if this momentum continues.‚Äù Source: Jurrien Timmer/X Timmer also says that a weakening US dollar may drive more investors into gold and, potentially, Bitcoin as a hedge against currency debasement. ‚ÄúOne of the big questions remains whether a new world order is emerging in which the US dollar loses at least some of its supremacy and is supplanted by a mixture of other fiat currencies and hard money (gold and perhaps Bitcoin). Maybe this regime change was signaled three years ago when gold stopped trading in lockstep with real rates.‚Äù Lastly, the analyst says the Sharpe ratio is now starting to favor BTC over gold as a better return on investment. The ratio was created by Nobel laureate William Sharpe and is designed to show the amount of return an investor could potentially get for enduring the volatility of a risky asset. ‚ÄúWith risk appetites rising, the baton has been passed back to Bitcoin, following the pattern of recent months.

2025-07-05T19:29:12,"Robert Kiyosaki Embraces Bitcoin Crash Fears as Buying Opportunity","As warnings about a possible Bitcoin (BTC) crash gain attention, many investors are growing nervous. However, Robert Kiyosaki, the author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, sees things differently. Rather than panic, he welcomes the idea of a price drop. Kiyosaki believes that a crash would be a perfect moment to increase his Bitcoin holdings, turning fear into opportunity. A Clear Strategy Behind the Bold Message In a recent X post , Kiyosaki strongly reacted to the ongoing noise surrounding a potential Bitcoin crash. He criticized those spreading fear, claiming that they aim to scare off short-term investors. For him, falling prices are not a problem but an invitation to buy more. Kiyosaki‚Äôs approach is not new. He has long seen Bitcoin as a haven against inflation and the weakening of traditional currencies. While others worry about temporary dips, he remains focused on the coin‚Äôs long-term value. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $108,062, up by 0.53% in the last 24 hours according to CoinMarketCap data. Robert Kiyosaki hopes the crypto prices drop so he can add more of it to his portfolio. This mindset follows his earlier declaration that he plans to buy more Bitcoin before it reaches a major milestone. He has shared his belief that Bitcoin could climb to $1 million within the next ten years. For Kiyosaki, the market volatility or fear of a downturn does not affect his future expectations. Support from the Bitcoin Community Kiyosaki is not alone in his belief. He referred to fellow Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor, who recently predicted much higher future prices. Saylor believes Bitcoin could reach $13 million in the next ten years. He thinks the digital coin might even hit $21 million by the mid-2040s, matching its total supply of 21 million coins. These bold predictions make Kiyosaki even more confident in Bitcoin. He says Bitcoin‚Äôs decentralized nature and limited supply are big reasons why it will grow in value over time. Robert Kiyosaki Looks to Bitcoin as the Dollar Loses Strength Robert Kiyosaki‚Äôs support for Bitcoin is closely linked to his concerns about traditional paper money, especially the US dollar. Over the years, he has often said that the dollar is losing value. He believes this is because central banks continue to print more money, especially during times of economic crisis. This leads to higher inflation, which makes everyday goods more expensive and savings less valuable. As a result, Kiyosaki views Bitcoin as a more effective way to protect one‚Äôs money. Since Bitcoin has a fixed supply, it can maintain its value more effectively over time. He also believes that future economic problems will exacerbate the issues with fiat money, which is why he continues to invest in the top cryptocurrency.

Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth¬†with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana‚Äôs (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solana-price-prediction/,"SOL|TRADING|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET","Crypto Price Predictions|Solana",cryptocompare
2025-07-05T19:00:11,"Bitcoin Cycle Top Finder Remains Untriggered ‚Äî What This Means For Price","Crypto researcher Julien Bittel has revealed that the Bitcoin cycle top has yet to happen, providing a bullish outlook for the flagship crypto. Instead, BTC just looks set to enter its most parabolic phase, eyeing new highs. Bitcoin Cycle Top Metric Yet To Be Triggered In an X post , Bittel alluded to the ‚ÄòGMI Bitcoin Cycle Top Finder‚Äô to prove that this cycle is far from over. He noted that the indicator has correctly spotted four top signals in Bitcoin‚Äôs history , and they each corresponded to a top for the flagship crypto. However, this time around, the indicator shows that BTC is nowhere near a cycle top. His accompanying chart also suggested that Bitcoin still has a long way to go in this cycle before it reaches a cycle top. This is bullish for the flagship crypto as it indicates that it still has more than enough upside to break through its current all-time high (ATH) of $111,900. It is worth mentioning that Bittel‚Äôs post was in response to crypto analyst TechDev, who also confirmed that the cycle isn‚Äôt over. In an X post , TechDev revealed that a launch signal, not a top signal, has appeared for Bitcoin. He noted that there have been launch signals in BTC‚Äôs history, and each of them sent the flagship crypto on a parabolic run. This launch signal has again triggered, with a massive rally potentially on the horizon for the BTC price . Crypto analyst Rekt Capital also recently confirmed that the Bitcoin cycle top isn‚Äôt yet in. However, he warned that another bear market will happen at some point. He stated that people think BTC will never see another bear market because it is now mainstream and too mature an asset. He added that this bear market will likely occur again after this bull market. BTC to Still Reach $200k This Year Asset manager Bitwise has maintained that the Bitcoin price can still reach $200,000 this year. They stated that they are holding firm to this prediction, as there is simply too much institutional demand for BTC to keep prices flat for long. This demand has occurred through the Bitcoin ETFs, which continue to record massive inflows. At the same time, several companies are adopting Strategy‚Äôs playbook of creating a BTC treasury. Standard Chartered has also predicted that the Bitcoin price can reach $200,000 by year-end. The bank believes that ETF inflows and corporate demand for BTC will spark the rally to this target. They also alluded to Powell‚Äôs potential early exit and the passing of the stablecoin bill as other factors that could serve as catalysts for this rally. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $108,265, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-cycle-top-finder/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Spot ETFs|Bitwise|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Coinmarketcap|Julien Bittel|Rekt Capital|Standard Chartered|TechDev",cryptocompare

In a new press release , the Fed is prohibiting former Jonah Bank employee Kendall Hickman from participating in activities related to financial institutions after she was allegedly found to have embezzled $33,212 from a nonprofit organization. According to the Fed, Hickman worked for both the Wyoming-based bank as well as moonlighted for an unnamed nonprofit organization as a bookkeeper. She worked for both firms from July 2021 to June 2023, and through unexplained means, she managed to embezzle the funds from the nonprofit, but was allegedly caught by authorities. The Fed says Hickman‚Äôs actions ‚Äúconstituted violations of law or regulation and involved personal dishonesty.‚Äù Though she has repaid the nonprofit in full and has consented to the enforcement actions against her, she has neither admitted nor denied any of the allegations. The prohibition order notes that taking this enforcement action doesn‚Äôt bar it from taking further actions against Hickman later on. If Hickman were to violate this order, she would be charged with separate civil or criminal penalties, according to the press release. Jonah Bank, the nation‚Äôs 1,474th-largest bank, has $529 million worth of assets under its management and was established in 2006.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs continued their strong performance this week, with their cumulative inflows soaring by $769 million. That‚Äôs down from $2.2 billion the previous week. The weekly decline is partially due to the fact that this week had four U.S. trading days, in observance of Independence Day ‚Äî a federal holiday in the United States. These ETFs have experienced cumulative inflows of $49 billion, indicating that they may surpass the $50 billion mark next week. BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Bitcoin Trust, whose ticker is IBIT, has had cumulative inflows of $52.6 billion. IBIT now holds over $76.5 billion in assets, making it one of the biggest ETFs in the United States. It ranks in eighth position among all BlackRock ETFs as it recently passed the iShares Core S&P Total US Stock Market ETF and the iShares Russell 2000 ETF. Observers note that the fund is likely to reach the $80 billion milestone soon.

2025-07-05T18:22:24,"Bitcoin ETF Now One of BlackRock‚Äôs Top Revenue Generators","BlackRock‚Äôs spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF), called IBIT, has quickly become one of the company‚Äôs most successful funds. Since its launch in January 2024, it has garnered strong support from both major investors and regular buyers. IBIT is now the third-highest revenue ETF among more than 1,100 funds managed by BlackRock, demonstrating its rapid growth in a short period. BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Boasts of Strong Revenue According to a recent report, IBIT now manages $76 billion in assets. The fund charges a 0.25% fee, which generates approximately $191 million in annual revenue. This puts it just behind two of BlackRock‚Äôs largest ETFs, the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF and the iShares MSCI EAFE ETF. However, the IBIT Bitcoin ETF is very close to outpacing these crypto funds in revenue. It is only $20 million behind the top fund and $16 million behind the second. The crypto fund needs just $9 billion more in assets to become the company‚Äôs top revenue-generating ETF. If the strong market interest continues, IBIT could reach that goal soon. More people are seeking easy ways to invest in digital assets, which could help the crypto investment fund rise even higher in the rankings. IBIT Named the Fastest-Growing ETF in History IBIT is growing faster than any other ETF ever . It has attracted a significant inflow of investors in a short time, surpassing the inflow of most ETFs in the market. It reached $2 billion in inflows just days after launching. Within six months, it crossed $50 billion in assets, making it one of the fastest-growing ETFs ever. This growth came from steady investments by hedge funds, companies, and financial advisors. This is happening because more people and companies are adding Bitcoin (BTC) into their balance sheet. A Sign of Growing Trust in Bitcoin One reason IBIT is doing well is that it makes buying Bitcoin simple. Investors do not need to open special crypto wallets or worry about how to keep their digital assets safe. With IBIT, they can invest in Bitcoin through a trusted and regulated fund. This makes it easier and safer for many to get involved with the top digital coin. BlackRock says IBIT‚Äôs growth demonstrates that more professional investors are now trusting Bitcoin. The way IBIT is growing is like how gold ETFs grew when they first started. This indicates that Bitcoin is beginning to be viewed as a conventional investment , alongside stocks or gold. As a result, the leading crypto asset is becoming a more accepted part of regular investment plans.

Phase 5 is over 60% filled, signaling that the window to buy at this price is narrowing.

The model combines the priority of transparency and the control that the user can have over it, which distinguishes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) among centralized services.

The team also introduced a leaderboard rewarding the top 50 holders with bonus tokens, incentivizing long-term commitment. Stablecoin and scalability vision Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum, fully collateralized to minimize depegging risks. By stabilizing the price of this stablecoin, lending, staking, and generating yield will be simplified, and the patients will be no longer affected by the volatile crypto market. To reduce gas costs and increase the speed of transactions, the Layer 2 scaling strategy laid out in the project is designed to make Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ready to conquer the international market. These characteristics improve the efficiency of capital and the experience of users, which makes this platform the best in the crypto market.

Last year, MrHodl was discussing Roger and his potential BTC holdings during a Twitter Space. After this conversation, I started looking into Roger Ver‚Äôs past purchase activity.

On July 4th, Decrypt reported that Justice Minister Gunnar Str√∂mmer formally directed police, taxmen, and the state Enforcement Authority to step up the seizure of crypto holdings. The move comes after a law was passed in November 2023 making confiscation of digital assets lawful if their owners are unable to account for its origin‚Äîwithout accusations of any offense. Over $8.4 million in assets has already been seized by authorities through the law. Str√∂mmer underscored how much better agencies can coordinate efforts when they conduct investigations into wealth tied to crypto by saying it‚Äôs ‚Äútime to turn up the pressure.‚Äù Why Sweden Is Ramping Up Crypto Enforcement The operation comes on the heels of mounting concern regarding cryptocurrency activity in Sweden‚Äôs illegal economy. In a report released in September 2024 jointly by Sweden‚Äôs Police Authority and Financial Intelligence Unit, money laundering sites for groups involved in drug trafficking and fraud were exposed by certain crypto exchanges. The report urged authorities to increase their presence on crypto sites in order to disrupt illicit finance streams. With an estimated 62,000 participants in organized crime activity discovered within Sweden, cryptocurrencies have become a strategic focus due to their anonymity and borderless nature. Seized Bitcoin: Future Asset or Legal Limbo? The support also extends to Parliament.

In a third-quarter fixed income outlook note seen by Reuters , BlackRock analysts say that growing government debt is weakening demand for key US assets like the dollar and long-dated Treasuries. While de-dollarization may be far-fetched, the analysts say the government‚Äôs fiscal situation is increasing that risk, especially following the passage of President Trump‚Äôs tax and spending bill, which is expected to add up to $5 trillion to the national debt over the next five years. Says BlackRock, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been highlighting the precarious position of the US government‚Äôs indebtedness for some time now, and, if left unchecked, we view debt as the single greatest risk to the ‚Äòspecial status‚Äô of the US in financial markets.‚Äù The firm‚Äôs investment managers also warn that an increasing amount of government spending is being allocated to paying off interest on the debt. According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), the US is projected to spend 5.3% of its GDP ‚Äì about 29% of all its revenue ‚Äì on interest on the national debt by 2034. BlackRock says there may not be enough natural demand to scoop up the amount of debt the US is trying to sell, which could prop up yields and make its debt burden even worse. ‚ÄúDespite proposed spending cuts, deficits are still climbing ‚Äì and more of that spending is now going toward interest payments‚Ä¶ With foreign investors stepping back and the government issuing more than half a trillion dollars of debt weekly, the risk of private markets being unable to absorb this debt and consequently pushing government borrowing costs higher, is tangible.‚Äù Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat ‚Äì Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Since the early April slide, Wall Street's tech-heavy Nasdaq index has surged 31%, while the broader S&P 500 index has rallied 24%, according to data source TradingView. Other major indices, such as Germany's DAX, France's CAC, Japan's Nikkei, and China's Shanghai Composite, have lagged behind Wall Street. Both Nasdaq and the S&P 500 traded at record highs Thursday. Demand for U.S. Treasury notes has held up amid concerns about fiscal sustainability, as noted by CoinDesk last month. The data contradicts the popular narrative that capital flows are rebalancing away from the U.S. en masse due to debt jitters and President Donald Trump's trade war and repeated criticism of the Federal Reserve. ""Several key factors that underpinned U.S. exceptionalism remain fully intact and are perhaps even strengthening further,"" Hani Redha, portfolio manager, head of strategy and research for global multi-asset at PineBridge Investments, wrote in a blog post published last month. Redha pointed to deregulation under Trump as a key factor supporting the US‚Äôs productivity supercycle ‚Äì unique among global peers ‚Äì and its lead globally. Economy validates U.S. exceptionalism Other economic variables, such as the real per capita GDP growth, also support the exceptionalism narrative. The metric¬†measures the rate at which the value of goods and services produced per person in an economy is adjusted for inflation. ""The U.S. massively outperforms the EU in terms of real per capita GDP growth. The reasons for that are deeply structural and haven't changed one bit. U.S. exceptionalism - for growth at least - is here to stay...,"" Robin Brooks, senior fellow in the Global Economy and Development program at the Brookings Institution, said on X . The U.S. jobs data released Thursday further added another stake in the ‚Äòloss of American exceptionalism narrative, as Bruce J Clark, head of rates at Informa Global Markets, said on LinkedIn. Implications for BTC and DXY The return of U.S. exceptionalism to U.S. stocks can be viewed as a positive development for bitcoin (BTC) and the broader crypto market, given the historical positive correlation between the two. BTC, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, has already risen 44% to $108,000, rallying swiftly from the early April lows of nearly $75,000, according to CoinDesk data. Moreover, with the pro-crypto president in the White House, one may argue that bitcoin is part of the U.S. exceptionalism play. Meanwhile, the return of U.S. exceptionalism could also put a floor under the U.S. dollar. ""With today‚Äôs jobs data putting another stake in the ‚Äòloss of American exceptionalism‚Äô narrative, the temptation to get long dollars here for a counter-trend trade is big and growing,"" Clark noted , adding the ECB officials' growing discomfort with the strong euro. Early this week, the FT reported , quoting a senior ECB official, that the central bank may need to signal that too much strengthening in the euro could be an issue, as it might lead inflation to hover below targets. Meanwhile, in an interview with Bloomberg, ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos said that ""overshooting"" of the euro should be avoided, flagging levels above 1.20 as complicated.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/05/the-u-s-exceptionalism-is-alive-and-well-as-nasdaq-outperforms-global-peers-macro-markets,"MARKET|BTC|REGULATION|ASIA|FIAT","Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|Stocks|News",cryptocompare

The XRP/USD continues to trade over the critical $2.20 support level, bolstered by Ripple‚Äôs aggressive push into traditional finance. The company recently filed for a U.S. national banking charter with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and is also seeking a Federal Reserve master account. If successful, these moves could integrate Ripple directly into the U.S. payments infrastructure ‚Äî an unprecedented development for a crypto-native entity. The news has revived optimism among traders, who are eyeing a possible long-term surge to $10. Meanwhile, institutional sentiment is improving, driven by: Ongoing speculation of an XRP ETF filing Ripple‚Äôs central bank digital currency (CBDC) partnerships across 50+ countries Broader adoption in cross-border payments infrastructure These indicators are reinforcing a solid fundamental backdrop in XRP, even as cryptocurrency markets stays in a state of cautious consolidation. Institutional Flows and ETF Rumours Fuel Speculative Targets XRP‚Äôs demand among institutions is growing despite macro uncertainty. Ripple‚Äôs continued engagement with regulators, including its pro-CBDC positioning, has made the asset a top contender for ETF consideration.

Banking License: May grant Ripple direct access to U.S. payment rails ETF Hopes: Could drive retail and institutional inflows CBDC Activity: Reinforces global relevance While the immediate path to $10 isn‚Äôt guaranteed, many in the market view Ripple‚Äôs alignment with traditional finance as a catalyst that may gradually close the gap. XRP Technical Outlook ‚Äì Watching the $2.23 Barrier From a technical perspective, XRP remains well-supported. The 2-hour chart shows the price respecting a rising trendline from the June 23 low, with the 50-SMA ($2.2281) and 100-SMA ($2.2079) forming a critical support zone. XRP/USD Price Chart ‚Äì Source: Tradingview XRP price prediction and its price action have been tightening into a wedge near $2.23, a resistance level that has been tested multiple times but not yet breached. Candlestick formations are neutral to indecisive, including spinning tops, signalling a volatility squeeze. If bulls manage a breakout above $2.2340 on substantial volume, XRP could quickly target $2.2822 and $2.3400. Conversely, a break below $2.20 may invite a pullback toward $2.147 or even $2.084.

2025-07-05T16:55:23,"Arthur Hayes Says Proposed Stablecoin Law Will Unleash Multi-Trillion-Dollar Liquidity Bazooka and Benefit Bitcoin, JPMorgan Chase ‚Äì Here‚Äôs How","BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes believes the US legislation seeking to establish a framework for dollar-pegged stablecoins will be bullish for Bitcoin ( BTC ) and major banks. In a new essay , Hayes says the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act will unlock trillions of dollars in liquidity and boost markets. According to Hayes, the GENIUS Act, which was passed in the U.S. Senate last month and is now waiting to be tabled on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives, will allow too-big-to-fail (TBTF) banks to issue stablecoins and unlock up to $6.8 trillion in liquidity. TBTF banks, which include megabanks such as JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo, are large financial institutions so critical to the economy that their failure would be catastrophic for the global financial system. In light of the GENIUS Act, Hayes says the best bet is not investing in non-bank stablecoin issuers such as Circle. ‚ÄúThe real stablecoin play isn‚Äôt betting on crusty FinTechs like Circle‚Äîit‚Äôs understanding that the US government just handed TBTF banks the launch keys to a multi-trillion-dollar liquidity bazooka disguised as ‚Äòinnovation‚Äô‚Ä¶ Instead, go long Bitcoin. Go long JPMorgan. Forget about Circle.‚Äù According to the BitMEX co-founder, the increased liquidity arising from allowing banks to issue stablecoins, as well as other fiscal policy measures, could send ‚ÄúBitcoin pumping 10x to $1 million.‚Äù The stocks of the megabanks, on the other hand, could soar by nearly 3x as a result of the GENIUS Act, per Hayes. ‚ÄúIf we take the average price-to-earnings ratio of the TBTF banks at 14.41x and multiply that by the cost savings and stablecoin NIM (net interest margin) potential, it comes out to $3.91 trillion. The current market cap of the eight TBTF banks is approximately $2.1 trillion, which means that stablecoins could pump TBTF bank stocks on average by 184%.‚Äù Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat ‚Äì Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

In letters to Zelle‚Äôs parent company and the banks ‚Äì specifically JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Capital One, PNC Bank, US Bank and Truist ‚Äì lawmakers demand to know more information on scams stemming from social media. In a lawsuit dropped by the Trump administration, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) accused Zelle of failing to implement adequate safeguards against fraudulent transactions, allowing scammers to exploit vulnerabilities and trigger $870 million in losses for hundreds of thousands of consumers. Now, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), and Representative Maxine Waters (D-CA) are pushing for stronger consumer protections and transparency, noting JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo‚Äôs 73% transaction dominance on the network. They‚Äôre asking the banks for data on social media scam frequency, bank reimbursement policies and measures to prevent fraud, warning Zelle‚Äôs rapid growth has outpaced its security, leaving millions vulnerable. They urge banks to follow JPMorgan Chase‚Äôs lead, which began blocking Zelle payments linked to social media in February. Failure to act, they say, could prompt stricter regulations. A separate investigation by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations found that JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo significantly decreased their reimbursement rate over time, from 62% of disputed transactions in 2019 to 38% in 2023. Zelle acknowledges fraud on the network but emphasizes its rarity, claiming 99.95% of transactions occur without issues.

2025-07-05T16:00:00,"Here‚Äôs why the Uniswap price remains in a bear market","The price of Uniswap has crashed into a bear market after falling by over 20% from its peak in May of this year. Uniswap ( UNI ) was trading at $6.95 on Saturday, July 5, which is significantly lower than its last November high of $20. This decline has brought its market capitalization to $4.8 billion, down from last year‚Äôs high of over $10 billion. UNI‚Äôs price crash has coincided with the ongoing sell-off of altcoins. The market cap of all cryptocurrencies, excluding Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), and stablecoins, has dropped by nearly 30% this year. One possible reason why Uniswap price has crashed is that it has lost market share in the decentralized exchange industry. For example, its DEX volume in the last 30 days was $80 billion, much lower than PancakeSwap‚Äôs $160 billion. You might also like: Pepe price holds bullish structure despite market conditions: why a reversal can occur The DEX industry has also faced increased competition from Hyperliquid, which handled over $220 billion in volume during the same period. Other top protocols competing with Uniswap are Raydium and Aerodrome Finance. On-chain data also indicate that investors have continued dumping the UNI token. The supply of UNI on exchanges has jumped to 84.6 million, up from the year-to-date low of 69 million. Rising exchange balances is a sign that holders are selling their coins. UNI price has also dropped as the supply held by whales has dwindled. These investors hold 723 million coins, down from 824 million in January. Whale dumping signals that they expect the coin to continue falling. Uniswap supply in exchanges, whale holdings, funding rate | Source: Santiment UNI‚Äôs funding rate has also moved into negative territory, implying that investors anticipate the future price to be lower than it is today. Uniswap price technical analysis UNI price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the UNI price has crashed from a high of nearly $20 in November last year to $6.98. It has pulled back after plunging from the year-to-date low of $4.7 to the current $6.9. The Uniswap price has also formed a bearish flag pattern, which consists of a vertical line and an ascending channel. Therefore, the coin is likely to experience a bearish breakdown, with the next key point to watch being the year-to-date low of $4.70. A move above the important resistance level at $8.6, the highest swing in May, will invalidate the bullish view.

Most 2025 forecasts show 2x to 4x gains depending on network adoption, ETF momentum, and Layer-2 integrations. For investors looking to beat those timelines and access Bitcoin-level wealth mechanics, Bitcoin Solaris is drawing serious attention. Now in phase 10 of its presale, Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is priced at $10 with a confirmed $20 exchange listing already locked in. The difference? It‚Äôs not just a promise. Over 11,500 users are already involved. Over $5 million in presale funding has come in. And the systems that drive the token economy are either live or in advanced development. Smartphone Mining and High-Speed Architecture One of the primary reasons investors are shifting focus to BTC-S is accessibility. With the Nova App, users contribute to blockchain validation directly from their smartphones using idle CPU and storage. No staking, no infrastructure ‚Äî just protocol-level integration that earns BTC-S in return. This is made possible by a hybrid architecture. Bitcoin Solaris uses Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Capacity at the base layer, while the Solaris Layer adds Delegated Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Time. That combination allows for 10,000 transactions per second with 2-second finality ‚Äî and an energy profile that‚Äôs 99.95% more efficient than Bitcoin. Tokenomics That Mirror Bitcoin ‚Äî Not Ethereum Ethereum‚Äôs supply is elastic. It burns fees, adjusts emissions, and reacts to market variables. Bitcoin Solaris offers a simpler proposition: 21 million tokens total, 4.2 million are available during presale. BTC-S is priced at $10 now. The launch price is set at $20. That‚Äôs more than 120% upside already confirmed‚Äîand that doesn‚Äôt factor in market demand or token velocity once listings go live. The presale ends July 31, and entry at this phase remains open to the public. As highlighted in a recent Crypto Vlog analysis , ‚ÄúBitcoin Solaris is where smart money is moving. Not for hype ‚Äî but for returns tied to actual usage.‚Äù Audits, Verifications, and Active Development Unlike most presale tokens, Bitcoin Solaris is already delivering. Cyberscope has completed its smart contract audit . Freshcoins audited the Nova App logic . The team is fully KYC-verified . And development isn‚Äôt waiting on listings. Development is advancing on multiple fronts. The Mining Power Marketplace ‚Äî where users will be able to rent or monetize computing power using BTC-S ‚Äî is actively under construction. Wallet enhancements are in progress to support broader functionality. A public testnet and full developer suite are on the roadmap for release in the near term. Ethereum will continue to grow. But Bitcoin Solaris is the only sub-$10 token on track to deliver network-driven returns before its first listing. The time window for entry is narrow ‚Äî and this presale is one of the last confirmed steps before the token moves into full circulation.

On its first day of trading on the CBOE BZX exchange, SSK attracted $12 million in inflows with a total trading volume of $33 million. The fund offers investors direct exposure to spot Solana as well as access to staking yields. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffarth described the trading debut as ‚Äúhealthy,‚Äù noting that $8 million in volume was recorded within the first 20 minutes. Balchunas further noted that SSK‚Äôs launch significantly outperformed the initial trading of Solana and XRP futures ETFs, although it was surpassed by the debut of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum funds.

Nate Geraci, President of NovaDius Wealth Management, described this approach as a ‚Äúregulatory workaround.‚Äù Anchorage Digital serves as both the staking and custody partner for SSK.

According to the newly updated settlement portal, General Motors will provide compensation to affected owners and lessees for issues related to excessive oil consumption in vehicles equipped with LC9 engines. The payout will go to customers in California, Idaho and North Carolina. The lawsuit alleges GM was aware of a defect triggered by excessively worn piston rings, which leads to excessive oil consumption, spark plug fouling, rough idling, rough acceleration, check engine light activation, engine shutdown commands, oil loss and potentially permanent engine damage or shutdown. Although GM has decided to settle, the company firmly denies any wrongdoing or liability and rejects the notion that any vehicles connected to the case are defective. The lawsuit alleges certain 2011 through 2014 models are defective, including Chevrolet Avalanche, Chevrolet Silverado, Chevrolet Suburban, Chevrolet Tahoe, GMC Sierra, GMC Yukon and GMC Yukon XL.

2025-07-05T15:30:43,"Crypto Market Cap On Track To $4.5 Trillion As Q3 Unfolds ‚Äì Details","Popular market analyst and key opinion leader (KOL) Ted Pillows is projecting the crypto market to hit a $4.5 trillion valuation before Q3 2025 ends. This interestingly bullish forecast comes off the back of another Bitcoin price rejection allowing the total crypto market cap to maintain the choppy price movement seen in the last month. Related Reading: Bitcoin Near Historic Weekly Close Despite Drop ‚Äì Analyst Warns Of Volatile Weekend Rally Ahead? Crypto Market Tests $3.5T Barrier In an X post on July 4, Pillows shares an insightful technical analysis on the total crypto market cap. Using the daily CryptoCap chart from Tradingview, the renowned analyst highlights the recent formation of a bull flag hinting at an impending price breakout. For context, the bull flag is a classic bullish continuation pattern. It starts with the formation of a flagpole i.e. a strong upward price movement, as seen between early April to late May when Bitcoin reached a new all-time high. This structure is followed by the ‚Äúflag,‚Äù i.e., a descending price channel that reflects a period of consolidation. This market action is seen from late May to the present, as the crypto market cap entered a temporary pullback phase. Pillows‚Äô analysis shows a complete bull flag formation. However, the crypto market cap must achieve a decisive price close above the $3.5 trillion mark which represents the upper boundary of the flag to confirm a price breakout. If this bullish scenario occurs, Ted Pillows predicts the crypto total market cap to surge to around $4.3 trillion ‚Äì $4.5 trillion in Q3 2025. Considering its market dominance levels of 62.77%, Bitcoin‚Äôs market cap could also rise to around $2.82 trillion in such bullish conditions providing a market price of $141,800 per unit. However, it‚Äôs worth noting that the occurrence of an altseason amidst this crypto price surge could alter the projected market status for the premier cryptocurrency.

However, the ongoing crypto bull run has delivered an impressive 51.24% gain over the past year. The market leader, Bitcoin, is presently valued at $108,118 reflecting a 1.46% loss in the last 24 hours as previously stated.

Additionally, with a finite cap of 84 million coins, LTC presents itself as a potential investment for value preservation, akin to Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a digital asset.

According to our Litecoin price prediction, the LTC price might hit the $500 mark in 2028. However, this rally depends on the future buying interest in the altcoin market. Does LTC have a good long-term future? Despite the recent adjustments and potential peak formation, Litecoin exhibits a robust long-term price trajectory and outlook, indicating a high potential for future growth. If the network continues to witness robust activities and growth, the price might reach $1000 in no time.

It‚Äôs now asking the public to share thoughts on whether the ETF can help stop fraud and manipulation.

However, as BTC‚Äôs price aims for a hold above the $110K mark in July, Litecoin‚Äôs price intends to end this month on a bullish note.

2025-07-05T15:25:29,"Veteran Trader to XRP Holders: You Are Not Bullish Enough. Here‚Äôs Why","Veteran crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto has sparked renewed optimism in the XRP community with a bold assertion: ‚ÄúYou are not bullish enough.‚Äù In a recent post on X, CrediBULL pointed to XRP‚Äôs strong and sustained technical positioning as evidence that most traders are drastically underestimating what could be a massive upcoming move. With XRP now entering its eighth consecutive month of consolidation above a key historical level, his statement has struck a chord across the crypto space. A Clean, Impulsive Rally from $0.50 CrediBULL highlights a critical detail that sets XRP apart from nearly every altcoin in the market: its clear and impulsive price action since rebounding from the $0.50 level. In technical terms, an impulsive move is the beginning of a strong bullish trend, often serving as the first leg of a multi-wave rally. According to CrediBULL, XRP and Bitcoin are currently the only major coins exhibiting such clean impulsive structures , a rare and powerful signal in a market often dominated by erratic volatility. Aside from being one of the only coins in this entire market with the clearest/cleanest impulsive PA (aside from $BTC ) starting at it's launch off of .50, $XRP is currently going on it's EIGHTH month of consolidation above the prior ATH monthly close. You Are Not ‚Ä¶ https://t.co/sM4zJgK378 pic.twitter.com/EucpQZVaLF ‚Äî CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) July 5, 2025 Since breaking above $0.50, XRP has demonstrated disciplined, wave-based movements that suggest accumulation rather than speculation. This behavior is not just bullish, it‚Äôs foundational. It means smart money could be quietly positioning ahead of a major breakout that retail investors have yet to fully price in. Consolidating Above a Major Historical Benchmark Perhaps even more telling than its wave structure is XRP‚Äôs current location on the chart. The asset has now spent eight months consolidating above its previous all-time high (ATH) monthly close, a level that capped XRP‚Äôs price in the 2017 bull run and again during much of the 2020‚Äì2021 cycle. In the world of technical analysis, this kind of sustained price action above a former ATH monthly close is highly significant. It signals that the market has re-evaluated the asset, converting long-standing resistance into solid support. For XRP, which has faced regulatory pressure and years of suppressed price action, this prolonged consolidation suggests a coiled spring preparing for release. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Why Traders Are Still Underestimating XRP Despite all of this, sentiment around XRP remains curiously subdued. Many traders remain skeptical, possibly due to the coin‚Äôs long and frustrating legal battle with the SEC. But with that case moving close to fresolution, the fundamental picture for XRP has never been clearer. CrediBULL argues that this sentiment lag is precisely what makes the current setup so powerful. While most of the market looks elsewhere, XRP has quietly built a base above a critical level, supported by a clean price structure and strengthening fundamentals, including Ripple‚Äôs expanding global reach, the integration of RLUSD, and regulatory clarity in key jurisdictions. Final Thoughts CrediBULL Crypto‚Äôs message is clear: XRP holders may be significantly underestimating what lies ahead. With technicals, sentiment, and fundamentals aligning, XRP is positioned for a potential breakout of historic proportions. For those still sitting on the sidelines or doubting the setup, the veteran trader‚Äôs warning couldn‚Äôt be more timely, this may be the calm before an explosive storm.

Cardano and XRP whales are now taking notice, as the project‚Äôs PayFi innovation opens up an entirely new world for real-world crypto adoption. What Makes PayFi Stand Out From ADA & XRP Remittix‚Äôs PayFi allows crypto holders to move BTC, ETH or XRP to traditional bank accounts in four and a half minutes. That bridge to the physical world is what XRP and Cardano have been reaching for, but Remittix seems to be there first. Cardano is trading at $0.5761, down by 4.12% with volume down by 50.24%. XRP also fell by 2.37% to $2.21, volume down 54.2%. The two cryptocurrencies have long touted mass adoption with seamless payments but now are at risk of being displaced by a leaner and faster model. Remittix, for its part, is already conducting full wallet flight testing and hopes to formally launch in Q3 2025. Why Whales Are Taking Remittix Seriously Whales prefer to track utility not buzz. And Remittix has aplenty. With over 547 million tokens already sold, an active presale at $0.0811 and an active 50% token bonus, large investors are considering gigantic upside potential. The project is seeking an $18M soft cap and having already received $15.9M+, it‚Äôs close to reaching that goal in a hurry. But what really makes it stand out is that it doesn‚Äôt merely guarantee cross-border payments, it does them. Whereas Cardano‚Äôs ongoing-building ecosystem or XRP‚Äôs perpetual fight against regulations, Remittix is giving consumers an instant use case anybody can comprehend: send crypto, get fiat. Can Remittix Catch Up with XRP And Cardano? If trends continue the way they are, it might. The demand for fast, efficient and global payment systems is growing rapidly. XRP and ADA helped create the early narrative on crypto utility and Remittix is turning that utility into reality with minimal friction. Remittix‚Äôs whitepaper has goals for global expansion and its product is already in functional test stages. That‚Äôs greater than several layer-1s or cross-border coins in the same tier. Investors are now wondering: if Remittix can do in one click what XRP and ADA have only dreamed about, why risk being short on the newer project? A Real Chance At The Top 10? Remittix isn‚Äôt some pretty-looking site coin. It‚Äôs a full payment system with real-world usage. By touching upon the crossroads between crypto and fiat, it‚Äôs addressing one of the biggest problems in crypto adoption today. As PayFi continues to gain steam and as whales continue to pour in, Remittix could threaten the very foundations that ADA and XRP were established on. If it continues to gain strength on this trajectory throughout Q3 and onwards, it would not be so surprising for Remittix (RTX) to climb into the top 10 crypto rankings.

Analysts note that since breaking above the $0.50 level, it has shown one of the strongest and clearest uptrends. Among major cryptocurrencies, only Bitcoin displays a more established and solid market structure. The monthly XRP chart is quietly showing strength. Historically, the $1.90‚Äì$2.00 zone has served as a key resistance level. But in 2024, XRP decisively broke above $2 and since then, the price has stabilized and is holding steady above it. Aside from being one of the only coins in this entire market with the clearest/cleanest impulsive PA (aside from $BTC ) starting at it's launch off of .50, $XRP is currently going on it's EIGHTH month of consolidation above the prior ATH monthly close. You Are Not ‚Ä¶ https://t.co/sM4zJgK378 pic.twitter.com/EucpQZVaLF ‚Äî CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) July 5, 2025 Analyst Predicts Bitcoin to Surge Beyond $30 XRP has firmly remained above the $1.90 mark for more than eight consecutive months. With price holding steady and low volatility, the pressure is building. When assets move like this, major breakouts often follow. According to Elliott Wave theory , XRP is all set to enter a strong upward trend. This means that we could see the price rise through five distinct waves, pushing it beyond $30 by mid-2026. Multiple Drivers Behind XRP‚Äôs Growth Analys t Vincent Code also predicts that XRP could hit $30‚Äì$50. He cited several reasons for XRP‚Äôs rise. RippleNet could capture 20‚Äì30% of the $1 trillion cross-border payments market. More than 50 countries may adopt XRP for CBDC bridges. A big crypto bull run in 2026‚Äì2027 could spark strong market excitement. Demand for RLUSD is also growing. Further, Ripple‚Äôs 2024 agreement with Saudi Arabia‚Äôs central bank could pave the way for XRP to be used in oil-related settlements. He also expects that an XRP Spot ETF approval could bring $20‚Äì$50 billion in institutional investments. Analyst MelarinX says that XRP is coiling like a spring and quietly building energy before a big breakout. Davinci Jeremie , a Bitcoin proponent has also made a U-turn and predicted that XRP could possibly hit $24 this year. He cited that many people in the US government are ‚Äúpushing for XRP.‚Äù XRP at a Crucial Price Crossroad XRP is currently trading at $2.23. It is stuck in a tight range, and key moving averages are closing in. This kind of setup often comes before a big, sudden move. Both upward and downward moves are possible. Nevertheless, XRP‚Äôs strong bullish setup and the growing institutional interest, like Ripple‚Äôs U.S. bank license bid and ETF talks, are keeping the long-term optimism alive.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrps-tight-range-signals-imminent-move-experts-predict-major-breakout/,"XRP|TRADING|MARKET|BTC|FIAT","News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare
2025-07-05T15:06:21,"Bitcoin (BTC) breakout delayed: Will it still happen?","Bitcoin (BTC) rose out of its bull flag on Thursday, and for all intents and purposes looked as though it might be able to consolidate above. However, the bears had other ideas, and not only forced the price back to the upper trendline, but drove it back inside the flag. Is this just a postponement of the breakout, or could the price be brought lower still? Is $BTC going to break out or not? Source: TradingView The short-term chart for $BTC shows a fakeout of the bull flag. When the price was over $110,000 on Thursday this was probably the last thing that the bulls expected. That said, $BTC was becoming overbought, and once the first breakout confirmation had been made, and the price rolled over again, the bulls suddenly lost their nerve and the price receded back into the bull flag. One further bearish factor that will give the bulls food for thought is that the surge out of the bull flag did not put in a higher high. It got pretty close, but pretty close still isn‚Äôt a higher high. On the more positive side of things, the overbought condition for $BTC is resetting as the Stochastic RSI indicators on the 4-hour time frame have now hit the bottom. Having said that, the 8-hour and 12-hour Stochastic RSIs still have a way to go, and might even start turning up before they get to the bottom. $106,000 important level to hold Source: TradingView The daily chart reveals that the price is still above the $106,000 support. This is an important level because it marks the top of some candle bodies from December 2024 through to January 2025. If this level continues to hold, the breakout and fakeout of the bull flag could just be a momentary setback. Weekly close crucial for deciding next week‚Äôs price direction Source: TradingView The 4 of July holiday in the United States may have had something to do with the lacklustre trading of $BTC on Friday. Be that as it may, looking at the macro picture, the surge out of the falling wedge pattern has turned into a classic bull flag, and it might be expected that this plays out to the upside, even if it does take a while longer. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI indicators are still sitting on a knife edge. Any positive or negative price action over this weekend could tip the scales in either direction. The ideal situation for the bulls would be for a confirmed cross back up at the end of Sunday. If this doesn‚Äôt take place, expect at least another week of sideways price action.
