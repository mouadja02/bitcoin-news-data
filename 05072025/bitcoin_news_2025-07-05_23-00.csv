2025-07-05T20:38:45,"Why Bitcoin will slingshot to $130,000 by August","Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) technical indicators suggest the maiden digital currency is likely to hit a new all-time high of around $130,000 in the coming weeks. This comes as Bitcoin attempts to reclaim the $110,000 level, which has acted as a major resistance point in recent sessions. As of press time, BTC was trading at $108,118, up 0.5% in the past 24 hours and nearly 1% over the past week. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold For the price outlook, analysis by TradingShot , in a TradingView post on July 5, highlighted that Bitcoin is flashing a strong bullish signal after completing a golden cross on the four-hour chart. The cryptocurrency is now holding above its four-hour 50-period moving average ( MA ), a key support level that, if maintained, could fuel a sharp rally. According to TradingShot, the current setup mirrors Bitcoin’s April–May rally, when a similar channel up pattern peaked near the 2.618 Fibonacci extension . The fractal shows the same series of lower highs, eventually broken by a strong upward move. Bitcoin price analysis chart.

If the pattern holds, TradingShot projects BTC could reach $130,000 by early August, aligning with the 2.618 Fibonacci level. Bitcoin’s key price levels to watch On the other hand, analysis by Ali Martinez in an X post on July 5 identified key price levels to watch. He noted that investors should keep an eye on $106,738 and $98,566. This is based on the latest In/Out of the Money Around Price analysis, which shows strong buyer interest concentrated in these two ranges, where significant numbers of addresses previously accumulated BTC.

Below that, another cluster of 1.71 million addresses is positioned near $98,566, providing additional support. On-chain data shows 89.36% of BTC holders are still “in the money,” highlighting resilience despite volatility, while just 10.36% are underwater. If Bitcoin falls further, two key demand zones could help cushion the downside and spark a rebound.

2025-07-05T20:00:51,"Three Strong Reasons to Buy XRP Before End of Summer","XRP has seen modest performance so far in 2025, with only a 5% gain in the first six months of the year. However, there are clear signs that the remainder of the year could present much stronger momentum for the cryptocurrency. Several key developments are on the horizon, which may justify taking a position in XRP before the end of summer. This article examines three major factors that could drive demand: regulatory clarity, the emergence of XRP-focused treasury strategies, and the potential approval of spot XRP ETFs. Regulatory clarity approaching The long-standing legal uncertainty surrounding XRP is close to resolution. Ripple, the company associated with XRP, has indicated since March that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was preparing to drop its case against it. In June, Ripple further stated it planned to withdraw any future appeals, while the SEC similarly suggested it would cease pursuing additional appeals. Although final paperwork remains outstanding, the case is expected to conclude by the end of July. Beyond the lawsuit, significant legislative efforts are progressing in Congress to create a more structured regulatory environment for digital assets. Two proposed laws — the Genius Act and the Clarity Act — are considered particularly relevant to XRP. The Genius Act sets out rules for stablecoins, a segment where the XRP blockchain could see new growth. Meanwhile, the Clarity Act would establish a regulatory framework for all digital assets. It could remove barriers for institutional investors wary of compliance risks. Both bills are projected to reach President Donald Trump’s desk for signature before Congress recesses in August, creating an environment of regulatory certainty that could benefit XRP’s adoption and value . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Treasury Companies Gaining Traction Another trend worth noting is the rise of companies adding XRP to their corporate treasuries. In June, VivoPower International announced plans to acquire $120 million worth of XRP for its balance sheet, marking the first such move of its kind. Soon after, Trident Digital Tech Holdings revealed it would allocate $500 million in XRP. These decisions echo the approach taken by Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, which amassed a significant Bitcoin position over the past five years, now valued at $65 billion. Although current XRP treasury initiatives are limited to smaller companies, there is growing anticipation that a larger firm may follow suit in the coming months. Analysts have suggested the possibility of a “MicroStrategy of XRP” emerging before the end of summer, which could further validate and elevate the asset in corporate finance circles. Spot XRP ETFs under review Perhaps the most anticipated development is the SEC’s pending decision on spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Bloomberg estimates a 95% likelihood that the SEC will approve a spot XRP ETF this year. The deadline for a final decision is mid-October. However, approval could come earlier. The recent SEC approval of a Grayscale fund holding XRP, Bitcoin, and Ethereum suggests momentum is building toward acceptance of dedicated spot XRP ETFs. If approved, spot ETFs would allow institutional capital to flow into XRP more easily, particularly once regulatory legislation is finalized. Industry observers have noted that such developments would signal that “it’s OK to invest in XRP,” removing legal and compliance concerns that previously restrained investment from larger entities. Looking Beyond Summer Investors should remain mindful of potential risks despite these positive catalysts. XRP has fallen short of expectations before, and if any of these developments fail to materialize, its price may stagnate or grow only modestly. However, if the three catalysts align as anticipated, there is optimism that XRP could retest its historical highs and strengthen its position in the market before year-end. Given the current trajectory and the convergence of these factors, summer 2025 appears to offer a unique opportunity for those considering entering or expanding their positions in XRP.

2025-07-05T20:00:23,"Scammers Drain $70,000 From Bank Accounts in Scheme Targeting JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citibank and Capital One Customers: Report","An ATM scheme has reportedly drained tens of thousands of dollars from elderly customers of the biggest banks in the United States. New York City police are warning senior citizens to be on the lookout for a trio of scammers at ATMs after a crime spree that occurred between May and June, reports The New York Post. Authorities warn that the group – made up of two men and a woman – act as good Samaritans by offering to help the elderly use the ATM or strike up a conversation with them as a distraction to try and steal their bank cards. Police say that on May 14th, the trio stole $20,000 from the bank account of a 90-year-old woman and drained $3,000 from the account of an 83-year-old woman in two separate incidents that occurred just one hour apart. On June 2nd, one of the thieves started up a conversation with a 71-year-old man while withdrawing cash at a Chase Bank ATM. While the victim was distracted, the scammer stole the man’s bank card and linked up with another man at a different Chase Bank ATM location, where they tried to take out $5,500. The 71-year-old says the scammers charged $6,000 to his account in just one hour. The thieves struck again on June 19th when they targeted an 86-year-old woman and stole about $24,000 from her account. According to the police, the trio is responsible for stealing at least $70,000 from elderly victims. Authorities say that a total of nine incidents of thieves using the same scheme against seniors at Chase Bank, Bank of America, Capital One and Citibank locations in New York were reported between May 8th and June 26th.

2025-07-05T20:00:14,"Litecoin Fate Tied To Bitcoin – Will $96 Resistance Crack?","In a recent X post, CryptoWzrd highlighted that Litecoin (LTC) closed the day on a slightly bearish note. He explained that LTC’s price action remains closely tied to Bitcoin’s movement and overall market sentiment, with the $96 level standing out as the next resistance. Bearish Daily Close For Litecoin Amid Bitcoin Correlation According to CryptoWzrd, Litecoin closed the day with a bearish daily candle, while mirroring Bitcoin’s price action. This alignment suggests that LTC remains heavily influenced by broader market sentiment and BTC’s directional moves. Meanwhile, the LTCBTC pair ended the session indecisively, offering no clear signal of strength or weakness against Bitcoin at the moment. Related Reading: Litecoin Surges Past Descending Resistance – Bulls Target $97.10 Level The analyst noted that for a sustained upside move in Litecoin, healthier and more constructive candles are needed on the LTCBTC chart. Without stronger signals from this pair, confidence in a breakout remains limited. Adding to the cautious tone, CryptoWzrd pointed out that a decline in Bitcoin dominance would be a critical factor in unlocking altcoin momentum, including for Litecoin. From a technical standpoint, Litecoin is currently aiming for the $96 daily resistance level. CryptoWzrd explained that a successful push above this barrier could open the door for a stronger rally, potentially extending toward the $128 resistance zone. However, that scenario depends on supportive market conditions and renewed strength across altcoin charts. On the downside, $80 stands out as the key daily support level that traders should monitor. A breakdown below this zone could trigger a deeper correction and delay any near-term bullish ambitions. Maintaining support above this level would be crucial in preserving the broader structure and keeping upward targets in play. Looking ahead, CryptoWzrd emphasized his focus on the lower time frames to spot potential scalp opportunities. By analyzing intraday chart formations, he aims to capitalize on short-term price movements while the broader market context unfolds. Traders following LTC closely will want to keep an eye on these short-term setups for quick entries and exits amid ongoing volatility. Intraday Volatility Signals Patience Over Action In conclusion, CryptoWzrd noted that today’s intraday chart for Litecoin was marked by volatility and a bearish tone, making it a challenging environment for clean trade setups. He emphasized the importance of waiting for a more favorable trading location before entering any positions, as the current conditions lacked clear direction and structure. Related Reading: Litecoin Could Be ‘Just Weeks Away’ From Third-Ever Golden Cross — Expert According to the analyst, a move above the $90 intraday resistance would be a positive signal and could present a potential long opportunity. However, if the price gets rejected at that level, it may lead to further downside pressure. For now, CryptoWzrd remains patient, waiting for the market to establish a healthier setup before taking action.

2025-07-05T19:30:15,"Bitcoin Primed To Hit New All-Time High Soon Enough, According to Fidelity’s Global Macro Analyst Jurrien Timmer – Here’s Why","Fidelity Investments’ global macro director Jurrien Timmer says that the stage is set for Bitcoin ( BTC ) to have an explosive breakout. In a new thread on the social media platform X, Timmer says that based on a historical relationship between Bitcoin and the global money supply metric the top digital asset by soon print new all-time highs. “With both liquidity improving per the global money supply and the stock market reaching new highs, it’s no surprise that Bitcoin is on the move again. Both Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde are being supported for now, and Bitcoin should be at new all-time highs soon enough if this momentum continues.” Source: Jurrien Timmer/X Timmer also says that a weakening US dollar may drive more investors into gold and, potentially, Bitcoin as a hedge against currency debasement. “One of the big questions remains whether a new world order is emerging in which the US dollar loses at least some of its supremacy and is supplanted by a mixture of other fiat currencies and hard money (gold and perhaps Bitcoin). Maybe this regime change was signaled three years ago when gold stopped trading in lockstep with real rates.” Lastly, the analyst says the Sharpe ratio is now starting to favor BTC over gold as a better return on investment. The ratio was created by Nobel laureate William Sharpe and is designed to show the amount of return an investor could potentially get for enduring the volatility of a risky asset. “With risk appetites rising, the baton has been passed back to Bitcoin, following the pattern of recent months. You can see that in the chart below, with the two Sharpe ratios converging.” Source: Jurrien Timmer/X Bitcoin is trading for $107,792 at time of writing, down 1.9% in the last 24 hours.

2025-07-05T19:29:12,"Robert Kiyosaki Embraces Bitcoin Crash Fears as Buying Opportunity","As warnings about a possible Bitcoin (BTC) crash gain attention, many investors are growing nervous. However, Robert Kiyosaki, the author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, sees things differently. Rather than panic, he welcomes the idea of a price drop. Kiyosaki believes that a crash would be a perfect moment to increase his Bitcoin holdings, turning fear into opportunity. A Clear Strategy Behind the Bold Message In a recent X post , Kiyosaki strongly reacted to the ongoing noise surrounding a potential Bitcoin crash. He criticized those spreading fear, claiming that they aim to scare off short-term investors. For him, falling prices are not a problem but an invitation to buy more. Kiyosaki’s approach is not new. He has long seen Bitcoin as a haven against inflation and the weakening of traditional currencies. While others worry about temporary dips, he remains focused on the coin’s long-term value. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $108,062, up by 0.53% in the last 24 hours according to CoinMarketCap data. Robert Kiyosaki hopes the crypto prices drop so he can add more of it to his portfolio. This mindset follows his earlier declaration that he plans to buy more Bitcoin before it reaches a major milestone. He has shared his belief that Bitcoin could climb to $1 million within the next ten years. For Kiyosaki, the market volatility or fear of a downturn does not affect his future expectations. Support from the Bitcoin Community Kiyosaki is not alone in his belief. He referred to fellow Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor, who recently predicted much higher future prices. Saylor believes Bitcoin could reach $13 million in the next ten years. He thinks the digital coin might even hit $21 million by the mid-2040s, matching its total supply of 21 million coins. These bold predictions make Kiyosaki even more confident in Bitcoin. He says Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and limited supply are big reasons why it will grow in value over time. Robert Kiyosaki Looks to Bitcoin as the Dollar Loses Strength Robert Kiyosaki’s support for Bitcoin is closely linked to his concerns about traditional paper money, especially the US dollar. Over the years, he has often said that the dollar is losing value. He believes this is because central banks continue to print more money, especially during times of economic crisis. This leads to higher inflation, which makes everyday goods more expensive and savings less valuable. As a result, Kiyosaki views Bitcoin as a more effective way to protect one’s money. Since Bitcoin has a fixed supply, it can maintain its value more effectively over time. He also believes that future economic problems will exacerbate the issues with fiat money, which is why he continues to invest in the top cryptocurrency.

Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solana-price-prediction/,"SOL|TRADING|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET","Crypto Price Predictions|Solana",cryptocompare
2025-07-05T19:00:11,"Bitcoin Cycle Top Finder Remains Untriggered — What This Means For Price","Crypto researcher Julien Bittel has revealed that the Bitcoin cycle top has yet to happen, providing a bullish outlook for the flagship crypto. Instead, BTC just looks set to enter its most parabolic phase, eyeing new highs. Bitcoin Cycle Top Metric Yet To Be Triggered In an X post , Bittel alluded to the ‘GMI Bitcoin Cycle Top Finder’ to prove that this cycle is far from over. He noted that the indicator has correctly spotted four top signals in Bitcoin’s history , and they each corresponded to a top for the flagship crypto. However, this time around, the indicator shows that BTC is nowhere near a cycle top. His accompanying chart also suggested that Bitcoin still has a long way to go in this cycle before it reaches a cycle top. This is bullish for the flagship crypto as it indicates that it still has more than enough upside to break through its current all-time high (ATH) of $111,900. It is worth mentioning that Bittel’s post was in response to crypto analyst TechDev, who also confirmed that the cycle isn’t over. In an X post , TechDev revealed that a launch signal, not a top signal, has appeared for Bitcoin. He noted that there have been launch signals in BTC’s history, and each of them sent the flagship crypto on a parabolic run. This launch signal has again triggered, with a massive rally potentially on the horizon for the BTC price . Crypto analyst Rekt Capital also recently confirmed that the Bitcoin cycle top isn’t yet in. However, he warned that another bear market will happen at some point. He stated that people think BTC will never see another bear market because it is now mainstream and too mature an asset. He added that this bear market will likely occur again after this bull market. BTC to Still Reach $200k This Year Asset manager Bitwise has maintained that the Bitcoin price can still reach $200,000 this year. They stated that they are holding firm to this prediction, as there is simply too much institutional demand for BTC to keep prices flat for long. This demand has occurred through the Bitcoin ETFs, which continue to record massive inflows. At the same time, several companies are adopting Strategy’s playbook of creating a BTC treasury. Standard Chartered has also predicted that the Bitcoin price can reach $200,000 by year-end. The bank believes that ETF inflows and corporate demand for BTC will spark the rally to this target. They also alluded to Powell’s potential early exit and the passing of the stablecoin bill as other factors that could serve as catalysts for this rally. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $108,265, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-cycle-top-finder/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Spot ETFs|Bitwise|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Coinmarketcap|Julien Bittel|Rekt Capital|Standard Chartered|TechDev",cryptocompare

In a new press release , the Fed is prohibiting former Jonah Bank employee Kendall Hickman from participating in activities related to financial institutions after she was allegedly found to have embezzled $33,212 from a nonprofit organization. According to the Fed, Hickman worked for both the Wyoming-based bank as well as moonlighted for an unnamed nonprofit organization as a bookkeeper. She worked for both firms from July 2021 to June 2023, and through unexplained means, she managed to embezzle the funds from the nonprofit, but was allegedly caught by authorities. The Fed says Hickman’s actions “constituted violations of law or regulation and involved personal dishonesty.” Though she has repaid the nonprofit in full and has consented to the enforcement actions against her, she has neither admitted nor denied any of the allegations. The prohibition order notes that taking this enforcement action doesn’t bar it from taking further actions against Hickman later on. If Hickman were to violate this order, she would be charged with separate civil or criminal penalties, according to the press release. Jonah Bank, the nation’s 1,474th-largest bank, has $529 million worth of assets under its management and was established in 2006.

The speaker of the New York City Council, Adrienne Adams, says the most populous US city is allocating $3 million to a guaranteed income program. The program will “provide direct cash grants to expecting mothers and foster youth facing housing insecurity.” Mayor Eric Adams hailed New York City Council’s $115.9 billion budget, which was agreed upon in late June, as the “Best Budget Ever.” While information was scant on how the New York City guaranteed income program will be rolled out, how long it will run, how many participants will be selected and other key details, this is not the first time the Big Apple is allocating funds to such an initiative. In the 2025 financial year, the New York City Council allocated $1.5 million to support a guaranteed income pilot program designed to assist “expectant mothers to improve maternal health and reduce child poverty.” This was the first time municipal funds had been used in a guaranteed income program. To run the program, the city partnered with The Bridge Project, a nonprofit focused on helping low-income expectant mothers. A total of 161 pregnant women experiencing housing insecurity who were selected to participate in The Bridge Project initiative will receive regular income with no strings attached for the first three years of their children’s lives.

2025-07-05T18:30:00,"Bitcoin takes a breather as Independence Day ETF inflows hit $769m","Bitcoin price was stuck in a tight range on Saturday, July 5, as the recent recovery faded during the US Independence Day Weekend. Bitcoin ( BTC ) was trading at $108,000, lower than this week’s high of $110,000, and 10% above the lowest point this month. Spot Bitcoin ETFs continued their strong performance this week, with their cumulative inflows soaring by $769 million. That’s down from $2.2 billion the previous week. The weekly decline is partially due to the fact that this week had four U.S. trading days, in observance of Independence Day — a federal holiday in the United States. These ETFs have experienced cumulative inflows of $49 billion, indicating that they may surpass the $50 billion mark next week. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, whose ticker is IBIT, has had cumulative inflows of $52.6 billion. IBIT now holds over $76.5 billion in assets, making it one of the biggest ETFs in the United States. It ranks in eighth position among all BlackRock ETFs as it recently passed the iShares Core S&P Total US Stock Market ETF and the iShares Russell 2000 ETF. Observers note that the fund is likely to reach the $80 billion milestone soon. IBIT has been the fastest-growing ETF ever and is continuing to close the gap with the SPDR Gold Trust, which has $101 billion in assets. GLD was established in 2004. Bitcoin demand continues rising The number of Bitcoin treasuries established by corporations is gaining momentum. Strategy is leading the way with 597,325 coins. These companies now hold 848,902 coins. Bitcoin Treasury Boom! 51 companies have already added Bitcoin to their treasuries. This shows a clear uptrend. Dive into all the details in this thread 🧵👇 pic.twitter.com/L5vt9u74fj — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) July 3, 2025 The rising demand for Bitcoin is occurring at a time when the supply on exchanges has dropped to 1.2 million, from a year-to-date high of over 1.5 million. Recently, shareholders of Vanadi Coffee approved a strategy to acquire more Bitcoin for its balance sheet. The publicly-listed chain that currently operates six cafes based only in Alicante, now aims to become the largest Spanish company with a Bitcoin treasury. Swedish gaming and web3 company Fragbite Group is also establishing a Bitcoin treasury to ‘future-proof’ its balance sheet. The firm has also appointed a dedicated director to oversee its Treasury operations.

It has remained above the 200-day Weighted Moving Average and formed two unique patterns that often lead to more gains. It has formed a cup-and-handle pattern and is now in the latter section. It has also formed a bullish flag pattern, which has a tall vertical line and a falling channel. Therefore, the most likely scenario is where Bitcoin breaks out and surges to a high of $144,000 in the coming months. A drop below the lower side of the flag section will invalidate the bullish outlook.

2025-07-05T18:22:24,"Bitcoin ETF Now One of BlackRock’s Top Revenue Generators","BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF), called IBIT, has quickly become one of the company’s most successful funds. Since its launch in January 2024, it has garnered strong support from both major investors and regular buyers. IBIT is now the third-highest revenue ETF among more than 1,100 funds managed by BlackRock, demonstrating its rapid growth in a short period. BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Boasts of Strong Revenue According to a recent report, IBIT now manages $76 billion in assets. The fund charges a 0.25% fee, which generates approximately $191 million in annual revenue. This puts it just behind two of BlackRock’s largest ETFs, the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF and the iShares MSCI EAFE ETF. However, the IBIT Bitcoin ETF is very close to outpacing these crypto funds in revenue. It is only $20 million behind the top fund and $16 million behind the second. The crypto fund needs just $9 billion more in assets to become the company’s top revenue-generating ETF. If the strong market interest continues, IBIT could reach that goal soon. More people are seeking easy ways to invest in digital assets, which could help the crypto investment fund rise even higher in the rankings. IBIT Named the Fastest-Growing ETF in History IBIT is growing faster than any other ETF ever . It has attracted a significant inflow of investors in a short time, surpassing the inflow of most ETFs in the market. It reached $2 billion in inflows just days after launching. Within six months, it crossed $50 billion in assets, making it one of the fastest-growing ETFs ever. This growth came from steady investments by hedge funds, companies, and financial advisors. This is happening because more people and companies are adding Bitcoin (BTC) into their balance sheet. A Sign of Growing Trust in Bitcoin One reason IBIT is doing well is that it makes buying Bitcoin simple. Investors do not need to open special crypto wallets or worry about how to keep their digital assets safe. With IBIT, they can invest in Bitcoin through a trusted and regulated fund. This makes it easier and safer for many to get involved with the top digital coin. BlackRock says IBIT’s growth demonstrates that more professional investors are now trusting Bitcoin. The way IBIT is growing is like how gold ETFs grew when they first started. This indicates that Bitcoin is beginning to be viewed as a conventional investment , alongside stocks or gold. As a result, the leading crypto asset is becoming a more accepted part of regular investment plans.

Currently trading at $105,734, BTC faces declining momentum as short-term holders cash in profits.

Phase 5 is over 60% filled, signaling that the window to buy at this price is narrowing. The next phase, Phase 6, will see a 16.7% price hike to $0.035, with the token set to launch at $0.06, guaranteeing a 100% return on investment for current buyers.

The model combines the priority of transparency and the control that the user can have over it, which distinguishes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) among centralized services. Furthermore, the project’s mtTokens enable users to earn interest while retaining liquidity, tradable within the ecosystem.

This robust security bolsters investor trust in the crypto market. Additionally, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched a Bug Bounty Program with CertiK, offering $50,000 in USDT rewards across four severity tiers: critical, major, minor, and low. The team also introduced a leaderboard rewarding the top 50 holders with bonus tokens, incentivizing long-term commitment. Stablecoin and scalability vision Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum, fully collateralized to minimize depegging risks. By stabilizing the price of this stablecoin, lending, staking, and generating yield will be simplified, and the patients will be no longer affected by the volatile crypto market. To reduce gas costs and increase the speed of transactions, the Layer 2 scaling strategy laid out in the project is designed to make Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ready to conquer the international market. These characteristics improve the efficiency of capital and the experience of users, which makes this platform the best in the crypto market. Consequently, investors are drawn to its blend of stability and innovation, positioning Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a top crypto to buy now. Looking ahead with optimism As Bitcoin’s rally cools, investors are seeking the best crypto to buy now, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a strong contender. The fact that it was successful in presale, has a secure infrastructure, and some innovative features such as a native stablecoin and Layer 2 scaling makes it a great option.

A total of 80,000 BTC were transferred to another cryptocurrency wallet. This transfer, confirmed by on-chain data, caused a great resonance in the crypto community, while Bitcoin analyst Sani made a striking claim about the identity of the whale: These BTCs may belong to Roger Ver. Analyst Sani made the following statement in his post on X (formerly Twitter): “I think the 80,000 BTC may belong to Roger Ver. Why? Last year, MrHodl was discussing Roger and his potential BTC holdings during a Twitter Space. After this conversation, I started looking into Roger Ver’s past purchase activity. I compared these dates to my database of unidentified addresses and only identified six addresses with 60,000 BTC.” Related News: Sweden's Minister of Justice Makes Critical Statements on Cryptocurrency: Issues New Instructions Noting that all six of these addresses made transfers today, Sani added that two other addresses that were previously registered in his system with the “Individual X” tag and therefore filtered were also activated. Thus, these chain transactions, which resulted in the transfer of a total of 80,000 BTC, drew attention to Roger Ver. Sani also suggested that this move could be part of a possible deal Roger Ver could make with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Known in the crypto world as “Bitcoin Jesus,” Roger Ver is known as one of the early investors in Bitcoin, but in recent years he has become a controversial figure, particularly with his support for Bitcoin SV. *This is not investment advice.

According to the settlement administration portal, impacted customers at Arizona-based Evolve Bank & Trust who file a claim and provide documentary evidence of losses resulting from the data breach stand to receive up to $3,000. A flat cash payment of $20 will also be available but claimants can only choose one or the other, not both. “In addition to selection one of the Cash Payment options, Settlement Class Members may elect one (1) year of monitoring that will provide the following benefits: Credit Monitoring, real-time alerts, and insurance coverage for up to $1,000,000 for identity theft.” Claims must be filed by October 30th. A final approval hearing of the settlement will be held on November 14th. The lawsuit against Evolve Bank & Trust was filed in January and alleges that cybercriminals infiltrated the billion-dollar lender’s information systems and gained access to sensitive and confidential information. In a notice to customers in July of 2024, Evolve Bank said the data breach had occurred between February and May of 2024. “…it appears the criminals downloaded information from our databases and a file share that included names, Social Security numbers, bank account numbers, and contact information for most of our personal banking customers, as well as customers of our Open Banking partners. We have also learned that personal information relating to our employees was also likely affected.” Evolve Bank & Trust, which started as First State Bank in 1925, is headquartered in West Memphis, Arizona.

2025-07-05T17:39:00,"Sweden Orders Crypto Seizures Without Proof of Crime in New Crackdown","Sweden Imposes Seizure of Crypto Without Proof of Crime in New Crackdown Sweden launched one of the strongest anti-crypto initiatives in Europe aimed at unexplained cryptocurrency holdings, empowering authorities to seize crypto without proof of crime. On July 4th, Decrypt reported that Justice Minister Gunnar Strömmer formally directed police, taxmen, and the state Enforcement Authority to step up the seizure of crypto holdings. The move comes after a law was passed in November 2023 making confiscation of digital assets lawful if their owners are unable to account for its origin—without accusations of any offense. Over $8.4 million in assets has already been seized by authorities through the law. Strömmer underscored how much better agencies can coordinate efforts when they conduct investigations into wealth tied to crypto by saying it’s “time to turn up the pressure.” Why Sweden Is Ramping Up Crypto Enforcement The operation comes on the heels of mounting concern regarding cryptocurrency activity in Sweden’s illegal economy. In a report released in September 2024 jointly by Sweden’s Police Authority and Financial Intelligence Unit, money laundering sites for groups involved in drug trafficking and fraud were exposed by certain crypto exchanges. The report urged authorities to increase their presence on crypto sites in order to disrupt illicit finance streams. With an estimated 62,000 participants in organized crime activity discovered within Sweden, cryptocurrencies have become a strategic focus due to their anonymity and borderless nature. Seized Bitcoin: Future Asset or Legal Limbo? The support also extends to Parliament. Sweden Democrat Dennis Dioukarev, who became newsworthy for demanding a national Bitcoin reserve, has proposed redirects seized crypto—especially Bitcoin—to Sweden’s central bank, the Riksbank. “Money taken from criminals would make Sweden financially stronger,” Dioukarev demanded. Yet the government has not indicated what it will do with the crypto it seizes from criminals. Strömmer’s office would not comment on whether such assets will be sold, retained, or added to a national reserve—leaving the fate of seized holdings uncertain. A New Digital Asset Era for Swedish Law Sweden’s move is a paradigm shift in how governments could address mysterious wealth in the era of crypto. While the policy has ignited privacy and due process concerns, authorities see the move as necessary to stay one step ahead of evolving financial crime.

According to the most recent data from BitcoinTreasures, the company has exactly 1,000 BTC stashed, ranking it 31st in the list of corporate treasuries holding the leading asset. A New Crypto Asset For Corporate Treasures Nano Labs Ltd., a Chinese company specializing in the production of mining chips and Web3 infrastructure, which is publicly traded on the NASDAQ, has shared a press release stating that it has purchased 74,315 Binance Coin (BNB). The price per coin averaged $672.45, and the total transaction is valued at about $50 million. The native token of the leading crypto exchange is currently the fifth-largest by market cap, according to current CoinGecko data, hovering around the $100 billion mark. CryptoPotato recently reported on Nano Labs’ intention to acquire BNB through a $500 million convertible note deal. Encouraging the initiative, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) disclosed that neither he nor any of his affiliates took part in the fundraiser, though he “remains extremely supportive.” The company also plans to apply for a stablecoin license in Hong Kong and has specifically mentioned building regulatory frameworks for BTC & BNB. With this purchase, their total reserve of digital currencies is around the $160M mark, which includes Binance Coin and Bitcoin. This makes Nano Labs the first publicly traded company to hold BNB in its reserves, but others are also following suit . Before the end of last year, the company also announced that it had begun accepting payments in Bitcoin. “Nano Labs’ acceptance for payments in Bitcoin aligns with its long-term vision of staying at the forefront of technology advancements and delivering added value to clients worldwide.

2025-07-05T17:33:35,"BlackRock Issues De-dollarization Warning, Says Rising Debt Levels Could Push Capital Outside US Borders: Report","The largest asset manager in the world says the risk of a de-dollarization of the global economy has edged higher due to rising US debt levels. In a third-quarter fixed income outlook note seen by Reuters , BlackRock analysts say that growing government debt is weakening demand for key US assets like the dollar and long-dated Treasuries. While de-dollarization may be far-fetched, the analysts say the government’s fiscal situation is increasing that risk, especially following the passage of President Trump’s tax and spending bill, which is expected to add up to $5 trillion to the national debt over the next five years. Says BlackRock, “We’ve been highlighting the precarious position of the US government’s indebtedness for some time now, and, if left unchecked, we view debt as the single greatest risk to the ‘special status’ of the US in financial markets.” The firm’s investment managers also warn that an increasing amount of government spending is being allocated to paying off interest on the debt. According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), the US is projected to spend 5.3% of its GDP – about 29% of all its revenue – on interest on the national debt by 2034. BlackRock says there may not be enough natural demand to scoop up the amount of debt the US is trying to sell, which could prop up yields and make its debt burden even worse. “Despite proposed spending cuts, deficits are still climbing – and more of that spending is now going toward interest payments… With foreign investors stepping back and the government issuing more than half a trillion dollars of debt weekly, the risk of private markets being unable to absorb this debt and consequently pushing government borrowing costs higher, is tangible.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-05T17:18:10,"U.S. Exceptionalism Is Alive and Well as Nasdaq Outperforms Global Peers: Macro Markets","U.S. exceptionalism, the notion that the U.S. economy and its financial markets are distinct compared to those of other nations, remains alive and well, at least according to the equity markets. Since the early April slide, Wall Street's tech-heavy Nasdaq index has surged 31%, while the broader S&P 500 index has rallied 24%, according to data source TradingView. Other major indices, such as Germany's DAX, France's CAC, Japan's Nikkei, and China's Shanghai Composite, have lagged behind Wall Street. Both Nasdaq and the S&P 500 traded at record highs Thursday. Demand for U.S. Treasury notes has held up amid concerns about fiscal sustainability, as noted by CoinDesk last month. The data contradicts the popular narrative that capital flows are rebalancing away from the U.S. en masse due to debt jitters and President Donald Trump's trade war and repeated criticism of the Federal Reserve. ""Several key factors that underpinned U.S. exceptionalism remain fully intact and are perhaps even strengthening further,"" Hani Redha, portfolio manager, head of strategy and research for global multi-asset at PineBridge Investments, wrote in a blog post published last month. Redha pointed to deregulation under Trump as a key factor supporting the US’s productivity supercycle – unique among global peers – and its lead globally. Economy validates U.S. exceptionalism Other economic variables, such as the real per capita GDP growth, also support the exceptionalism narrative. The metric measures the rate at which the value of goods and services produced per person in an economy is adjusted for inflation. ""The U.S. massively outperforms the EU in terms of real per capita GDP growth. The reasons for that are deeply structural and haven't changed one bit. U.S. exceptionalism - for growth at least - is here to stay...,"" Robin Brooks, senior fellow in the Global Economy and Development program at the Brookings Institution, said on X . The U.S. jobs data released Thursday further added another stake in the ‘loss of American exceptionalism narrative, as Bruce J Clark, head of rates at Informa Global Markets, said on LinkedIn. Implications for BTC and DXY The return of U.S. exceptionalism to U.S. stocks can be viewed as a positive development for bitcoin (BTC) and the broader crypto market, given the historical positive correlation between the two. BTC, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, has already risen 44% to $108,000, rallying swiftly from the early April lows of nearly $75,000, according to CoinDesk data. Moreover, with the pro-crypto president in the White House, one may argue that bitcoin is part of the U.S. exceptionalism play. Meanwhile, the return of U.S. exceptionalism could also put a floor under the U.S. dollar. ""With today’s jobs data putting another stake in the ‘loss of American exceptionalism’ narrative, the temptation to get long dollars here for a counter-trend trade is big and growing,"" Clark noted , adding the ECB officials' growing discomfort with the strong euro. Early this week, the FT reported , quoting a senior ECB official, that the central bank may need to signal that too much strengthening in the euro could be an issue, as it might lead inflation to hover below targets. Meanwhile, in an interview with Bloomberg, ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos said that ""overshooting"" of the euro should be avoided, flagging levels above 1.20 as complicated.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/05/the-u-s-exceptionalism-is-alive-and-well-as-nasdaq-outperforms-global-peers-macro-markets,"MARKET|BTC|REGULATION|ASIA|FIAT","Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|Stocks|News",cryptocompare

The rapper compares fickle friends to the cryptocurrency’s rollercoaster price moves, saying he looked at it “like a BTC”: “Could be down this week, then I’m up next week.” It’s not the first time bitcoin has appeared in Drake’s orbit. In the past few years, the Canadian superstar has become one of crypto’s most visible celebrity community members. The rapper shared a clip of Michael Saylor on his Instagram account, which at the time had over 146 million followers, where Strategy’s co-founder said bitcoin would “eat” gold.

The XRP/USD continues to trade over the critical $2.20 support level, bolstered by Ripple’s aggressive push into traditional finance. The company recently filed for a U.S. national banking charter with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and is also seeking a Federal Reserve master account. If successful, these moves could integrate Ripple directly into the U.S. payments infrastructure — an unprecedented development for a crypto-native entity. The news has revived optimism among traders, who are eyeing a possible long-term surge to $10. Meanwhile, institutional sentiment is improving, driven by: Ongoing speculation of an XRP ETF filing Ripple’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) partnerships across 50+ countries Broader adoption in cross-border payments infrastructure These indicators are reinforcing a solid fundamental backdrop in XRP, even as cryptocurrency markets stays in a state of cautious consolidation. Institutional Flows and ETF Rumours Fuel Speculative Targets XRP’s demand among institutions is growing despite macro uncertainty. Ripple’s continued engagement with regulators, including its pro-CBDC positioning, has made the asset a top contender for ETF consideration. XRP EYES $10: Ripple Moves to Become a U.S. Bank Ripple’s pursuit of a U.S. banking license could be the catalyst that propels #XRP to $10+ and unlocking massive utility, adoption, and trust on a global scale. A new era for crypto is taking shape. Are you ready? pic.twitter.com/8smFXqU9Ji — XRP Governor (@xrpgovernor) July 5, 2025 Traders and analysts point to a scenario where ETF approval, combined with regulatory clarity and Ripple’s potential U.S. banking license , could propel XRP toward the $10 mark — a level once thought speculative but increasingly discussed. Banking License: May grant Ripple direct access to U.S. payment rails ETF Hopes: Could drive retail and institutional inflows CBDC Activity: Reinforces global relevance While the immediate path to $10 isn’t guaranteed, many in the market view Ripple’s alignment with traditional finance as a catalyst that may gradually close the gap. XRP Technical Outlook – Watching the $2.23 Barrier From a technical perspective, XRP remains well-supported. The 2-hour chart shows the price respecting a rising trendline from the June 23 low, with the 50-SMA ($2.2281) and 100-SMA ($2.2079) forming a critical support zone. XRP/USD Price Chart – Source: Tradingview XRP price prediction and its price action have been tightening into a wedge near $2.23, a resistance level that has been tested multiple times but not yet breached. Candlestick formations are neutral to indecisive, including spinning tops, signalling a volatility squeeze. If bulls manage a breakout above $2.2340 on substantial volume, XRP could quickly target $2.2822 and $2.3400. Conversely, a break below $2.20 may invite a pullback toward $2.147 or even $2.084. XRP Trade Setup – Breakout in the Making: Entry: Above $2.23 on bullish confirmation Targets: $2.2822 → $2.3400 Stop-Loss: Below $2.20 trendline Bias: Bullish while above 100-SMA With Ripple’s institutional alignment deepening and price holding above support, XRP remains one of the most closely watched altcoins in 2025.

2025-07-05T16:55:23,"Arthur Hayes Says Proposed Stablecoin Law Will Unleash Multi-Trillion-Dollar Liquidity Bazooka and Benefit Bitcoin, JPMorgan Chase – Here’s How","BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes believes the US legislation seeking to establish a framework for dollar-pegged stablecoins will be bullish for Bitcoin ( BTC ) and major banks. In a new essay , Hayes says the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act will unlock trillions of dollars in liquidity and boost markets. According to Hayes, the GENIUS Act, which was passed in the U.S. Senate last month and is now waiting to be tabled on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives, will allow too-big-to-fail (TBTF) banks to issue stablecoins and unlock up to $6.8 trillion in liquidity. TBTF banks, which include megabanks such as JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo, are large financial institutions so critical to the economy that their failure would be catastrophic for the global financial system. In light of the GENIUS Act, Hayes says the best bet is not investing in non-bank stablecoin issuers such as Circle. “The real stablecoin play isn’t betting on crusty FinTechs like Circle—it’s understanding that the US government just handed TBTF banks the launch keys to a multi-trillion-dollar liquidity bazooka disguised as ‘innovation’… Instead, go long Bitcoin. Go long JPMorgan. Forget about Circle.” According to the BitMEX co-founder, the increased liquidity arising from allowing banks to issue stablecoins, as well as other fiscal policy measures, could send “Bitcoin pumping 10x to $1 million.” The stocks of the megabanks, on the other hand, could soar by nearly 3x as a result of the GENIUS Act, per Hayes. “If we take the average price-to-earnings ratio of the TBTF banks at 14.41x and multiply that by the cost savings and stablecoin NIM (net interest margin) potential, it comes out to $3.91 trillion. The current market cap of the eight TBTF banks is approximately $2.1 trillion, which means that stablecoins could pump TBTF bank stocks on average by 184%.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

In letters to Zelle’s parent company and the banks – specifically JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Capital One, PNC Bank, US Bank and Truist – lawmakers demand to know more information on scams stemming from social media. In a lawsuit dropped by the Trump administration, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) accused Zelle of failing to implement adequate safeguards against fraudulent transactions, allowing scammers to exploit vulnerabilities and trigger $870 million in losses for hundreds of thousands of consumers. Now, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), and Representative Maxine Waters (D-CA) are pushing for stronger consumer protections and transparency, noting JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo’s 73% transaction dominance on the network. They’re asking the banks for data on social media scam frequency, bank reimbursement policies and measures to prevent fraud, warning Zelle’s rapid growth has outpaced its security, leaving millions vulnerable. They urge banks to follow JPMorgan Chase’s lead, which began blocking Zelle payments linked to social media in February. Failure to act, they say, could prompt stricter regulations. A separate investigation by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations found that JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo significantly decreased their reimbursement rate over time, from 62% of disputed transactions in 2019 to 38% in 2023. Zelle acknowledges fraud on the network but emphasizes its rarity, claiming 99.95% of transactions occur without issues.

2025-07-05T16:00:00,"Here’s why the Uniswap price remains in a bear market","The price of Uniswap has crashed into a bear market after falling by over 20% from its peak in May of this year. Uniswap ( UNI ) was trading at $6.95 on Saturday, July 5, which is significantly lower than its last November high of $20. This decline has brought its market capitalization to $4.8 billion, down from last year’s high of over $10 billion. UNI’s price crash has coincided with the ongoing sell-off of altcoins. The market cap of all cryptocurrencies, excluding Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), and stablecoins, has dropped by nearly 30% this year. One possible reason why Uniswap price has crashed is that it has lost market share in the decentralized exchange industry. For example, its DEX volume in the last 30 days was $80 billion, much lower than PancakeSwap’s $160 billion. You might also like: Pepe price holds bullish structure despite market conditions: why a reversal can occur The DEX industry has also faced increased competition from Hyperliquid, which handled over $220 billion in volume during the same period. Other top protocols competing with Uniswap are Raydium and Aerodrome Finance. On-chain data also indicate that investors have continued dumping the UNI token. The supply of UNI on exchanges has jumped to 84.6 million, up from the year-to-date low of 69 million. Rising exchange balances is a sign that holders are selling their coins. UNI price has also dropped as the supply held by whales has dwindled. These investors hold 723 million coins, down from 824 million in January. Whale dumping signals that they expect the coin to continue falling. Uniswap supply in exchanges, whale holdings, funding rate | Source: Santiment UNI’s funding rate has also moved into negative territory, implying that investors anticipate the future price to be lower than it is today. Uniswap price technical analysis UNI price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the UNI price has crashed from a high of nearly $20 in November last year to $6.98. It has pulled back after plunging from the year-to-date low of $4.7 to the current $6.9. The Uniswap price has also formed a bearish flag pattern, which consists of a vertical line and an ascending channel. Therefore, the coin is likely to experience a bearish breakdown, with the next key point to watch being the year-to-date low of $4.70. A move above the important resistance level at $8.6, the highest swing in May, will invalidate the bullish view.

2025-07-05T15:58:21,"Ethereum Price Prediction 2025 Shows Gains, But Bitcoin Solaris Presale Investors Could See Fortune-Building Returns Sooner","Ethereum remains one of crypto’s strongest assets — but its trajectory requires time. Most 2025 forecasts show 2x to 4x gains depending on network adoption, ETF momentum, and Layer-2 integrations. For investors looking to beat those timelines and access Bitcoin-level wealth mechanics, Bitcoin Solaris is drawing serious attention. Now in phase 10 of its presale, Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is priced at $10 with a confirmed $20 exchange listing already locked in. The difference? It’s not just a promise. Over 11,500 users are already involved. Over $5 million in presale funding has come in. And the systems that drive the token economy are either live or in advanced development. Smartphone Mining and High-Speed Architecture One of the primary reasons investors are shifting focus to BTC-S is accessibility. With the Nova App, users contribute to blockchain validation directly from their smartphones using idle CPU and storage. No staking, no infrastructure — just protocol-level integration that earns BTC-S in return. This is made possible by a hybrid architecture. Bitcoin Solaris uses Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Capacity at the base layer, while the Solaris Layer adds Delegated Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Time. That combination allows for 10,000 transactions per second with 2-second finality — and an energy profile that’s 99.95% more efficient than Bitcoin. Tokenomics That Mirror Bitcoin — Not Ethereum Ethereum’s supply is elastic. It burns fees, adjusts emissions, and reacts to market variables. Bitcoin Solaris offers a simpler proposition: 21 million tokens total, 4.2 million are available during presale. BTC-S is priced at $10 now. The launch price is set at $20. That’s more than 120% upside already confirmed—and that doesn’t factor in market demand or token velocity once listings go live. The presale ends July 31, and entry at this phase remains open to the public. As highlighted in a recent Crypto Vlog analysis , “Bitcoin Solaris is where smart money is moving. Not for hype — but for returns tied to actual usage.” Audits, Verifications, and Active Development Unlike most presale tokens, Bitcoin Solaris is already delivering. Cyberscope has completed its smart contract audit . Freshcoins audited the Nova App logic . The team is fully KYC-verified . And development isn’t waiting on listings. Development is advancing on multiple fronts. The Mining Power Marketplace — where users will be able to rent or monetize computing power using BTC-S — is actively under construction. Wallet enhancements are in progress to support broader functionality. A public testnet and full developer suite are on the roadmap for release in the near term. Ethereum will continue to grow. But Bitcoin Solaris is the only sub-$10 token on track to deliver network-driven returns before its first listing. The time window for entry is narrow — and this presale is one of the last confirmed steps before the token moves into full circulation.

On its first day of trading on the CBOE BZX exchange, SSK attracted $12 million in inflows with a total trading volume of $33 million. The fund offers investors direct exposure to spot Solana as well as access to staking yields. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffarth described the trading debut as “healthy,” noting that $8 million in volume was recorded within the first 20 minutes. Balchunas further noted that SSK’s launch significantly outperformed the initial trading of Solana and XRP futures ETFs, although it was surpassed by the debut of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum funds. Regulatory Highlights The fund is structured under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which allows it to bypass the standard Form 19b-4 filing process typically required for spot ETFs. Nate Geraci, President of NovaDius Wealth Management, described this approach as a “regulatory workaround.” Anchorage Digital serves as both the staking and custody partner for SSK. Growing Institutional Interest The launch of SSK coincided with a surge in institutional interest in Solana. Open interest in Solana futures on the CME reached a record $167 million, signaling increased attention from institutional investors. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US have returned to positive capital inflows. Over the course of two days, investors poured more than $1 billion into these funds, offsetting a previous outflow of $342.2 million. On July 2, net inflows totaled $407.8 million, followed by $601.8 million the next day. Fidelity’s FBTC fund led the way, attracting $184 million and $237.1 million on those respective days.

According to the newly updated settlement portal, General Motors will provide compensation to affected owners and lessees for issues related to excessive oil consumption in vehicles equipped with LC9 engines. The payout will go to customers in California, Idaho and North Carolina. The lawsuit alleges GM was aware of a defect triggered by excessively worn piston rings, which leads to excessive oil consumption, spark plug fouling, rough idling, rough acceleration, check engine light activation, engine shutdown commands, oil loss and potentially permanent engine damage or shutdown. Although GM has decided to settle, the company firmly denies any wrongdoing or liability and rejects the notion that any vehicles connected to the case are defective. The lawsuit alleges certain 2011 through 2014 models are defective, including Chevrolet Avalanche, Chevrolet Silverado, Chevrolet Suburban, Chevrolet Tahoe, GMC Sierra, GMC Yukon and GMC Yukon XL. Eligible owners or lessees may automatically receive a pro rata payment estimated at a minimum of $2,149).

This interestingly bullish forecast comes off the back of another Bitcoin price rejection allowing the total crypto market cap to maintain the choppy price movement seen in the last month. Related Reading: Bitcoin Near Historic Weekly Close Despite Drop – Analyst Warns Of Volatile Weekend Rally Ahead? Crypto Market Tests $3.5T Barrier In an X post on July 4, Pillows shares an insightful technical analysis on the total crypto market cap. Using the daily CryptoCap chart from Tradingview, the renowned analyst highlights the recent formation of a bull flag hinting at an impending price breakout. For context, the bull flag is a classic bullish continuation pattern. It starts with the formation of a flagpole i.e. a strong upward price movement, as seen between early April to late May when Bitcoin reached a new all-time high. This structure is followed by the “flag,” i.e., a descending price channel that reflects a period of consolidation. This market action is seen from late May to the present, as the crypto market cap entered a temporary pullback phase. Pillows’ analysis shows a complete bull flag formation. However, the crypto market cap must achieve a decisive price close above the $3.5 trillion mark which represents the upper boundary of the flag to confirm a price breakout. If this bullish scenario occurs, Ted Pillows predicts the crypto total market cap to surge to around $4.3 trillion – $4.5 trillion in Q3 2025. Considering its market dominance levels of 62.77%, Bitcoin’s market cap could also rise to around $2.82 trillion in such bullish conditions providing a market price of $141,800 per unit. However, it’s worth noting that the occurrence of an altseason amidst this crypto price surge could alter the projected market status for the premier cryptocurrency.
