According to the settlement administration portal, impacted customers at Arizona-based Evolve Bank & Trust who file a claim and provide documentary evidence of losses resulting from the data breach stand to receive up to $3,000. A flat cash payment of $20 will also be available but claimants can only choose one or the other, not both. “In addition to selection one of the Cash Payment options, Settlement Class Members may elect one (1) year of monitoring that will provide the following benefits: Credit Monitoring, real-time alerts, and insurance coverage for up to $1,000,000 for identity theft.” Claims must be filed by October 30th. A final approval hearing of the settlement will be held on November 14th. The lawsuit against Evolve Bank & Trust was filed in January and alleges that cybercriminals infiltrated the billion-dollar lender’s information systems and gained access to sensitive and confidential information. In a notice to customers in July of 2024, Evolve Bank said the data breach had occurred between February and May of 2024. “…it appears the criminals downloaded information from our databases and a file share that included names, Social Security numbers, bank account numbers, and contact information for most of our personal banking customers, as well as customers of our Open Banking partners. We have also learned that personal information relating to our employees was also likely affected.” Evolve Bank & Trust, which started as First State Bank in 1925, is headquartered in West Memphis, Arizona.

2025-07-05T17:39:00,"Sweden Orders Crypto Seizures Without Proof of Crime in New Crackdown","Sweden Imposes Seizure of Crypto Without Proof of Crime in New Crackdown Sweden launched one of the strongest anti-crypto initiatives in Europe aimed at unexplained cryptocurrency holdings, empowering authorities to seize crypto without proof of crime. On July 4th, Decrypt reported that Justice Minister Gunnar Strömmer formally directed police, taxmen, and the state Enforcement Authority to step up the seizure of crypto holdings. The move comes after a law was passed in November 2023 making confiscation of digital assets lawful if their owners are unable to account for its origin—without accusations of any offense. Over $8.4 million in assets has already been seized by authorities through the law. Strömmer underscored how much better agencies can coordinate efforts when they conduct investigations into wealth tied to crypto by saying it’s “time to turn up the pressure.” Why Sweden Is Ramping Up Crypto Enforcement The operation comes on the heels of mounting concern regarding cryptocurrency activity in Sweden’s illegal economy. In a report released in September 2024 jointly by Sweden’s Police Authority and Financial Intelligence Unit, money laundering sites for groups involved in drug trafficking and fraud were exposed by certain crypto exchanges. The report urged authorities to increase their presence on crypto sites in order to disrupt illicit finance streams. With an estimated 62,000 participants in organized crime activity discovered within Sweden, cryptocurrencies have become a strategic focus due to their anonymity and borderless nature. Seized Bitcoin: Future Asset or Legal Limbo? The support also extends to Parliament. Sweden Democrat Dennis Dioukarev, who became newsworthy for demanding a national Bitcoin reserve, has proposed redirects seized crypto—especially Bitcoin—to Sweden’s central bank, the Riksbank. “Money taken from criminals would make Sweden financially stronger,” Dioukarev demanded. Yet the government has not indicated what it will do with the crypto it seizes from criminals. Strömmer’s office would not comment on whether such assets will be sold, retained, or added to a national reserve—leaving the fate of seized holdings uncertain. A New Digital Asset Era for Swedish Law Sweden’s move is a paradigm shift in how governments could address mysterious wealth in the era of crypto. While the policy has ignited privacy and due process concerns, authorities see the move as necessary to stay one step ahead of evolving financial crime. As more governments grapple with controlling virtual assets, Sweden’s controversial model could become a European—and world—blueprint.",btcpulse,https://btc-pulse.com/sweden-orders-crypto-seizures-without-proof-of-crime/,"REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT","Blockchain|Regulation",cryptocompare

According to the most recent data from BitcoinTreasures, the company has exactly 1,000 BTC stashed, ranking it 31st in the list of corporate treasuries holding the leading asset. A New Crypto Asset For Corporate Treasures Nano Labs Ltd., a Chinese company specializing in the production of mining chips and Web3 infrastructure, which is publicly traded on the NASDAQ, has shared a press release stating that it has purchased 74,315 Binance Coin (BNB). The price per coin averaged $672.45, and the total transaction is valued at about $50 million. The native token of the leading crypto exchange is currently the fifth-largest by market cap, according to current CoinGecko data, hovering around the $100 billion mark. CryptoPotato recently reported on Nano Labs’ intention to acquire BNB through a $500 million convertible note deal. Encouraging the initiative, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) disclosed that neither he nor any of his affiliates took part in the fundraiser, though he “remains extremely supportive.” The company also plans to apply for a stablecoin license in Hong Kong and has specifically mentioned building regulatory frameworks for BTC & BNB. With this purchase, their total reserve of digital currencies is around the $160M mark, which includes Binance Coin and Bitcoin. This makes Nano Labs the first publicly traded company to hold BNB in its reserves, but others are also following suit . Before the end of last year, the company also announced that it had begun accepting payments in Bitcoin. “Nano Labs’ acceptance for payments in Bitcoin aligns with its long-term vision of staying at the forefront of technology advancements and delivering added value to clients worldwide.

2025-07-05T17:33:35,"BlackRock Issues De-dollarization Warning, Says Rising Debt Levels Could Push Capital Outside US Borders: Report","The largest asset manager in the world says the risk of a de-dollarization of the global economy has edged higher due to rising US debt levels. In a third-quarter fixed income outlook note seen by Reuters , BlackRock analysts say that growing government debt is weakening demand for key US assets like the dollar and long-dated Treasuries. While de-dollarization may be far-fetched, the analysts say the government’s fiscal situation is increasing that risk, especially following the passage of President Trump’s tax and spending bill, which is expected to add up to $5 trillion to the national debt over the next five years. Says BlackRock, “We’ve been highlighting the precarious position of the US government’s indebtedness for some time now, and, if left unchecked, we view debt as the single greatest risk to the ‘special status’ of the US in financial markets.” The firm’s investment managers also warn that an increasing amount of government spending is being allocated to paying off interest on the debt. According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), the US is projected to spend 5.3% of its GDP – about 29% of all its revenue – on interest on the national debt by 2034. BlackRock says there may not be enough natural demand to scoop up the amount of debt the US is trying to sell, which could prop up yields and make its debt burden even worse. “Despite proposed spending cuts, deficits are still climbing – and more of that spending is now going toward interest payments… With foreign investors stepping back and the government issuing more than half a trillion dollars of debt weekly, the risk of private markets being unable to absorb this debt and consequently pushing government borrowing costs higher, is tangible.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The rapper compares fickle friends to the cryptocurrency’s rollercoaster price moves, saying he looked at it “like a BTC”: “Could be down this week, then I’m up next week.” It’s not the first time bitcoin has appeared in Drake’s orbit. In the past few years, the Canadian superstar has become one of crypto’s most visible celebrity community members. The rapper shared a clip of Michael Saylor on his Instagram account, which at the time had over 146 million followers, where Strategy’s co-founder said bitcoin would “eat” gold. He’s also dropped more than $1 million worth of bitcoin on losing bets for the Dallas Mavericks and Edmonton Oilers, with other high-profile punts on UFC fights and Formula One races. Drake’s betting performance has inspired memes calling it the “Drake Curse,” referencing losses in the teams and athletes he bets on. The rapper addressed that curse, telling fans he’s just a “flawed sports bettor.” Yet Drake isn’t just rolling dice. He has partnered with crypto gambling platform Stake, in a partnership that’s reported to be worth $100 million annually. Outside the casino lights, Drake has made crypto investments in firms, including MoonPay and brandished hardware wallets on social media.

The XRP/USD continues to trade over the critical $2.20 support level, bolstered by Ripple’s aggressive push into traditional finance. The company recently filed for a U.S. national banking charter with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and is also seeking a Federal Reserve master account. If successful, these moves could integrate Ripple directly into the U.S. payments infrastructure — an unprecedented development for a crypto-native entity. The news has revived optimism among traders, who are eyeing a possible long-term surge to $10. Meanwhile, institutional sentiment is improving, driven by: Ongoing speculation of an XRP ETF filing Ripple’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) partnerships across 50+ countries Broader adoption in cross-border payments infrastructure These indicators are reinforcing a solid fundamental backdrop in XRP, even as cryptocurrency markets stays in a state of cautious consolidation. Institutional Flows and ETF Rumours Fuel Speculative Targets XRP’s demand among institutions is growing despite macro uncertainty. Ripple’s continued engagement with regulators, including its pro-CBDC positioning, has made the asset a top contender for ETF consideration. XRP EYES $10: Ripple Moves to Become a U.S. Bank Ripple’s pursuit of a U.S. banking license could be the catalyst that propels #XRP to $10+ and unlocking massive utility, adoption, and trust on a global scale. A new era for crypto is taking shape. Are you ready? pic.twitter.com/8smFXqU9Ji — XRP Governor (@xrpgovernor) July 5, 2025 Traders and analysts point to a scenario where ETF approval, combined with regulatory clarity and Ripple’s potential U.S. banking license , could propel XRP toward the $10 mark — a level once thought speculative but increasingly discussed. Banking License: May grant Ripple direct access to U.S. payment rails ETF Hopes: Could drive retail and institutional inflows CBDC Activity: Reinforces global relevance While the immediate path to $10 isn’t guaranteed, many in the market view Ripple’s alignment with traditional finance as a catalyst that may gradually close the gap. XRP Technical Outlook – Watching the $2.23 Barrier From a technical perspective, XRP remains well-supported. The 2-hour chart shows the price respecting a rising trendline from the June 23 low, with the 50-SMA ($2.2281) and 100-SMA ($2.2079) forming a critical support zone. XRP/USD Price Chart – Source: Tradingview XRP price prediction and its price action have been tightening into a wedge near $2.23, a resistance level that has been tested multiple times but not yet breached. Candlestick formations are neutral to indecisive, including spinning tops, signalling a volatility squeeze. If bulls manage a breakout above $2.2340 on substantial volume, XRP could quickly target $2.2822 and $2.3400. Conversely, a break below $2.20 may invite a pullback toward $2.147 or even $2.084. XRP Trade Setup – Breakout in the Making: Entry: Above $2.23 on bullish confirmation Targets: $2.2822 → $2.3400 Stop-Loss: Below $2.20 trendline Bias: Bullish while above 100-SMA With Ripple’s institutional alignment deepening and price holding above support, XRP remains one of the most closely watched altcoins in 2025.

2025-07-05T16:55:23,"Arthur Hayes Says Proposed Stablecoin Law Will Unleash Multi-Trillion-Dollar Liquidity Bazooka and Benefit Bitcoin, JPMorgan Chase – Here’s How","BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes believes the US legislation seeking to establish a framework for dollar-pegged stablecoins will be bullish for Bitcoin ( BTC ) and major banks. In a new essay , Hayes says the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act will unlock trillions of dollars in liquidity and boost markets. According to Hayes, the GENIUS Act, which was passed in the U.S. Senate last month and is now waiting to be tabled on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives, will allow too-big-to-fail (TBTF) banks to issue stablecoins and unlock up to $6.8 trillion in liquidity. TBTF banks, which include megabanks such as JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo, are large financial institutions so critical to the economy that their failure would be catastrophic for the global financial system. In light of the GENIUS Act, Hayes says the best bet is not investing in non-bank stablecoin issuers such as Circle. “The real stablecoin play isn’t betting on crusty FinTechs like Circle—it’s understanding that the US government just handed TBTF banks the launch keys to a multi-trillion-dollar liquidity bazooka disguised as ‘innovation’… Instead, go long Bitcoin. Go long JPMorgan. Forget about Circle.” According to the BitMEX co-founder, the increased liquidity arising from allowing banks to issue stablecoins, as well as other fiscal policy measures, could send “Bitcoin pumping 10x to $1 million.” The stocks of the megabanks, on the other hand, could soar by nearly 3x as a result of the GENIUS Act, per Hayes. “If we take the average price-to-earnings ratio of the TBTF banks at 14.41x and multiply that by the cost savings and stablecoin NIM (net interest margin) potential, it comes out to $3.91 trillion. The current market cap of the eight TBTF banks is approximately $2.1 trillion, which means that stablecoins could pump TBTF bank stocks on average by 184%.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

In letters to Zelle’s parent company and the banks – specifically JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Capital One, PNC Bank, US Bank and Truist – lawmakers demand to know more information on scams stemming from social media. In a lawsuit dropped by the Trump administration, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) accused Zelle of failing to implement adequate safeguards against fraudulent transactions, allowing scammers to exploit vulnerabilities and trigger $870 million in losses for hundreds of thousands of consumers. Now, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), and Representative Maxine Waters (D-CA) are pushing for stronger consumer protections and transparency, noting JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo’s 73% transaction dominance on the network. They’re asking the banks for data on social media scam frequency, bank reimbursement policies and measures to prevent fraud, warning Zelle’s rapid growth has outpaced its security, leaving millions vulnerable. They urge banks to follow JPMorgan Chase’s lead, which began blocking Zelle payments linked to social media in February. Failure to act, they say, could prompt stricter regulations. A separate investigation by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations found that JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo significantly decreased their reimbursement rate over time, from 62% of disputed transactions in 2019 to 38% in 2023. Zelle acknowledges fraud on the network but emphasizes its rarity, claiming 99.95% of transactions occur without issues.

2025-07-05T16:00:48,"Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Suggests Institutional Demand Remains Strong – Details","Bitcoin enters the weekend in an uncertain position, struggling to break above its all-time high of $112,000, while altcoins face increasing pressure and retrace to lower levels. After a week of volatility, BTC failed to close Friday above the key resistance, casting doubt on immediate bullish continuation. However, analysts remain cautiously optimistic as price action still holds above major support, and a strong weekly close could shift sentiment decisively. Top analyst Daan highlighted that since the market’s recovery two weeks ago, we’ve seen a consistent Coinbase premium—a bullish signal often linked to spot buying pressure from US-based investors. This premium had previously traded down amid heightened uncertainty surrounding Middle Eastern geopolitical tensions but has since rebounded, reflecting improved market confidence. Now, traders are closely watching the weekend price action to determine whether Bitcoin can reclaim $112K and enter price discovery, or if another rejection will send it into a deeper consolidation phase. With key macro narratives easing and on-chain signals improving, the weekend could provide a critical clue about Bitcoin’s short-term trajectory—and whether altcoins can follow with renewed strength. Bitcoin Range Tightens As Market Awaits Breakout Signal Bitcoin is preparing for a decisive move, one that could trigger renewed bullish momentum across the crypto market, particularly for altcoins. For the past several days, BTC has been consolidating in a well-defined range between $103,000 and $110,000. A clear breakout above this resistance or breakdown below support is expected to spark a swift move, as traders await confirmation of the next directional trend. The broader macroeconomic environment has become more favorable. With uncertainty from global geopolitical tensions subsiding and US fiscal policies gaining clarity, the stage appears set for Bitcoin to enter a bullish phase over the coming months. However, risks still linger. US Treasury Yields are rising again, and inflation has not stabilized, factors that could inject volatility and hesitation into risk markets. Daan pointed out a consistent Coinbase premium since the recovery began two weeks ago—a bullish indicator suggesting persistent spot demand, particularly from US-based buyers. This premium had weakened during the wave of Middle Eastern concerns, but it has since rebounded and held steady. Daan adds that this is supported by strong ETF inflows, a sign of institutional confidence. Still, caution is warranted. If Bitcoin stalls while ETF inflows remain high, that could mark a local top, as seen in previous cycles. For now, as long as price continues to follow the strength of inflows and maintains support above $103K, the bulls remain in control. A break above $110K could open the gates to new all-time highs, while a loss of support could lead to a sharp correction and delay broader recovery across the crypto landscape. BTC Daily Chart Analysis: Eyes On $112K Breakout Bitcoin continues to trade within a key range between $103,600 and $109,300, consolidating just below its all-time high near $112,000. As shown on the daily chart, BTC has held above the 50-day simple moving average (SMA), which currently sits at $106,469, acting as dynamic support during recent pullbacks. This indicates ongoing strength in the trend, despite short-term volatility. The chart also reveals that price has tested the $109,300 resistance level multiple times since March, but without a decisive breakout. Volume during these retests has been relatively muted, suggesting that bulls may be waiting for stronger confirmation before committing to a sustained breakout move. On the downside, $103,600 remains a crucial support level, historically providing a springboard for rebounds throughout the last two months. The 100-day and 200-day SMAs at $98,544 and $96,364, respectively, are still trending upward, reinforcing the long-term bullish structure. If Bitcoin can decisively close above $109,300 on strong volume, price discovery could quickly follow, with $120,000 and beyond as potential targets. However, failure to hold current levels may open the door for a retest of $100K or lower, making this range-bound phase critical for the market’s next direction.

2025-07-05T16:00:00,"Here’s why the Uniswap price remains in a bear market","The price of Uniswap has crashed into a bear market after falling by over 20% from its peak in May of this year. Uniswap ( UNI ) was trading at $6.95 on Saturday, July 5, which is significantly lower than its last November high of $20. This decline has brought its market capitalization to $4.8 billion, down from last year’s high of over $10 billion. UNI’s price crash has coincided with the ongoing sell-off of altcoins. The market cap of all cryptocurrencies, excluding Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), and stablecoins, has dropped by nearly 30% this year. One possible reason why Uniswap price has crashed is that it has lost market share in the decentralized exchange industry. For example, its DEX volume in the last 30 days was $80 billion, much lower than PancakeSwap’s $160 billion. You might also like: Pepe price holds bullish structure despite market conditions: why a reversal can occur The DEX industry has also faced increased competition from Hyperliquid, which handled over $220 billion in volume during the same period. Other top protocols competing with Uniswap are Raydium and Aerodrome Finance. On-chain data also indicate that investors have continued dumping the UNI token. The supply of UNI on exchanges has jumped to 84.6 million, up from the year-to-date low of 69 million. Rising exchange balances is a sign that holders are selling their coins. UNI price has also dropped as the supply held by whales has dwindled. These investors hold 723 million coins, down from 824 million in January. Whale dumping signals that they expect the coin to continue falling. Uniswap supply in exchanges, whale holdings, funding rate | Source: Santiment UNI’s funding rate has also moved into negative territory, implying that investors anticipate the future price to be lower than it is today. Uniswap price technical analysis UNI price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the UNI price has crashed from a high of nearly $20 in November last year to $6.98. It has pulled back after plunging from the year-to-date low of $4.7 to the current $6.9. The Uniswap price has also formed a bearish flag pattern, which consists of a vertical line and an ascending channel. Therefore, the coin is likely to experience a bearish breakdown, with the next key point to watch being the year-to-date low of $4.70. A move above the important resistance level at $8.6, the highest swing in May, will invalidate the bullish view.

2025-07-05T15:58:21,"Ethereum Price Prediction 2025 Shows Gains, But Bitcoin Solaris Presale Investors Could See Fortune-Building Returns Sooner","Ethereum remains one of crypto’s strongest assets — but its trajectory requires time. Most 2025 forecasts show 2x to 4x gains depending on network adoption, ETF momentum, and Layer-2 integrations. For investors looking to beat those timelines and access Bitcoin-level wealth mechanics, Bitcoin Solaris is drawing serious attention. Now in phase 10 of its presale, Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is priced at $10 with a confirmed $20 exchange listing already locked in. The difference? It’s not just a promise. Over 11,500 users are already involved. Over $5 million in presale funding has come in. And the systems that drive the token economy are either live or in advanced development. Smartphone Mining and High-Speed Architecture One of the primary reasons investors are shifting focus to BTC-S is accessibility. With the Nova App, users contribute to blockchain validation directly from their smartphones using idle CPU and storage. No staking, no infrastructure — just protocol-level integration that earns BTC-S in return. This is made possible by a hybrid architecture. Bitcoin Solaris uses Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Capacity at the base layer, while the Solaris Layer adds Delegated Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Time. That combination allows for 10,000 transactions per second with 2-second finality — and an energy profile that’s 99.95% more efficient than Bitcoin. Tokenomics That Mirror Bitcoin — Not Ethereum Ethereum’s supply is elastic. It burns fees, adjusts emissions, and reacts to market variables. Bitcoin Solaris offers a simpler proposition: 21 million tokens total, 4.2 million are available during presale. BTC-S is priced at $10 now. The launch price is set at $20. That’s more than 120% upside already confirmed—and that doesn’t factor in market demand or token velocity once listings go live. The presale ends July 31, and entry at this phase remains open to the public. As highlighted in a recent Crypto Vlog analysis , “Bitcoin Solaris is where smart money is moving. Not for hype — but for returns tied to actual usage.” Audits, Verifications, and Active Development Unlike most presale tokens, Bitcoin Solaris is already delivering. Cyberscope has completed its smart contract audit . Freshcoins audited the Nova App logic . The team is fully KYC-verified . And development isn’t waiting on listings. Development is advancing on multiple fronts. The Mining Power Marketplace — where users will be able to rent or monetize computing power using BTC-S — is actively under construction. Wallet enhancements are in progress to support broader functionality. A public testnet and full developer suite are on the roadmap for release in the near term. Ethereum will continue to grow. But Bitcoin Solaris is the only sub-$10 token on track to deliver network-driven returns before its first listing. The time window for entry is narrow — and this presale is one of the last confirmed steps before the token moves into full circulation.

2025-07-05T15:53:13,"Solana ETF with Staking Feature Debuts, Attracting $12 Million","The first Solana-based ETF with staking capabilities, the REX-Osprey Solana Staking ETF (SSK), has launched in the United States, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. On its first day of trading on the CBOE BZX exchange, SSK attracted $12 million in inflows with a total trading volume of $33 million. The fund offers investors direct exposure to spot Solana as well as access to staking yields. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffarth described the trading debut as “healthy,” noting that $8 million in volume was recorded within the first 20 minutes. Balchunas further noted that SSK’s launch significantly outperformed the initial trading of Solana and XRP futures ETFs, although it was surpassed by the debut of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum funds. Regulatory Highlights The fund is structured under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which allows it to bypass the standard Form 19b-4 filing process typically required for spot ETFs. Nate Geraci, President of NovaDius Wealth Management, described this approach as a “regulatory workaround.” Anchorage Digital serves as both the staking and custody partner for SSK. Growing Institutional Interest The launch of SSK coincided with a surge in institutional interest in Solana. Open interest in Solana futures on the CME reached a record $167 million, signaling increased attention from institutional investors. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US have returned to positive capital inflows. Over the course of two days, investors poured more than $1 billion into these funds, offsetting a previous outflow of $342.2 million. On July 2, net inflows totaled $407.8 million, followed by $601.8 million the next day. Fidelity’s FBTC fund led the way, attracting $184 million and $237.1 million on those respective days. BlackRock’s IBIT fund also saw strong interest, raising $224.5 million on July 3 after two days of zero flows.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9818/solana-etf-with-staking-feature-debuts-attracting-12-million,"SOL|TRADING|BUSINESS|BTC|ETH","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

According to the newly updated settlement portal, General Motors will provide compensation to affected owners and lessees for issues related to excessive oil consumption in vehicles equipped with LC9 engines. The payout will go to customers in California, Idaho and North Carolina. The lawsuit alleges GM was aware of a defect triggered by excessively worn piston rings, which leads to excessive oil consumption, spark plug fouling, rough idling, rough acceleration, check engine light activation, engine shutdown commands, oil loss and potentially permanent engine damage or shutdown. Although GM has decided to settle, the company firmly denies any wrongdoing or liability and rejects the notion that any vehicles connected to the case are defective. The lawsuit alleges certain 2011 through 2014 models are defective, including Chevrolet Avalanche, Chevrolet Silverado, Chevrolet Suburban, Chevrolet Tahoe, GMC Sierra, GMC Yukon and GMC Yukon XL. Eligible owners or lessees may automatically receive a pro rata payment estimated at a minimum of $2,149). North Carolina class members must submit a required Identification Form to confirm eligibility, while others generally need not file a claim unless notified.

2025-07-05T15:30:43,"Crypto Market Cap On Track To $4.5 Trillion As Q3 Unfolds – Details","Popular market analyst and key opinion leader (KOL) Ted Pillows is projecting the crypto market to hit a $4.5 trillion valuation before Q3 2025 ends. This interestingly bullish forecast comes off the back of another Bitcoin price rejection allowing the total crypto market cap to maintain the choppy price movement seen in the last month. Related Reading: Bitcoin Near Historic Weekly Close Despite Drop – Analyst Warns Of Volatile Weekend Rally Ahead? Crypto Market Tests $3.5T Barrier In an X post on July 4, Pillows shares an insightful technical analysis on the total crypto market cap. Using the daily CryptoCap chart from Tradingview, the renowned analyst highlights the recent formation of a bull flag hinting at an impending price breakout. For context, the bull flag is a classic bullish continuation pattern. It starts with the formation of a flagpole i.e. a strong upward price movement, as seen between early April to late May when Bitcoin reached a new all-time high. This structure is followed by the “flag,” i.e., a descending price channel that reflects a period of consolidation. This market action is seen from late May to the present, as the crypto market cap entered a temporary pullback phase. Pillows’ analysis shows a complete bull flag formation. However, the crypto market cap must achieve a decisive price close above the $3.5 trillion mark which represents the upper boundary of the flag to confirm a price breakout. If this bullish scenario occurs, Ted Pillows predicts the crypto total market cap to surge to around $4.3 trillion – $4.5 trillion in Q3 2025. Considering its market dominance levels of 62.77%, Bitcoin’s market cap could also rise to around $2.82 trillion in such bullish conditions providing a market price of $141,800 per unit. However, it’s worth noting that the occurrence of an altseason amidst this crypto price surge could alter the projected market status for the premier cryptocurrency.

Is Litecoin a good investment? Litecoin is an alternative to Bitcoin, making it an appealing choice for everyday transactions worldwide. Additionally, with a finite cap of 84 million coins, LTC presents itself as a potential investment for value preservation, akin to Bitcoin’s role as a digital asset. Why is the LTC price down today?

According to our Litecoin price prediction, the LTC price might hit the $500 mark in 2028. However, this rally depends on the future buying interest in the altcoin market. Does LTC have a good long-term future? Despite the recent adjustments and potential peak formation, Litecoin exhibits a robust long-term price trajectory and outlook, indicating a high potential for future growth. If the network continues to witness robust activities and growth, the price might reach $1000 in no time. Recent news/opinion on Litecoin The U.S. SEC has postponed its decision on Canary Funds’ plan to launch a spot Litecoin (LTC) ETF. It’s now asking the public to share thoughts on whether the ETF can help stop fraud and manipulation. Litecoin price prediction July 2025 Litecoin’s price shows signs of bullish moves as it has been surging toward $100. However, as BTC’s price aims for a hold above the $110K mark in July, Litecoin’s price intends to end this month on a bullish note. As a result, we might see the LTC price record a low of $75, with a maximum price of $115 and an average price of $95.

In 2022, Litecoin experienced significant losses, dropping below $45 mid-year. However, it managed to outperform the broader market despite a nearly 55% decline overall. 2023 saw high volatility for Litecoin, peaking at $114.50 in July but declining sharply due to market pressures, ending the year at $72.80 with a modest 7% rise despite underperforming the broader market. In 2024, Litecoin started the year around $68.20, climbed to $102.40 in April, and then fell below $80. After further declines in May and June, it dropped to $49 in August before rebounding to $70. By November, Litecoin surged past $100 and attempted to hold above $140 in December. In January 2025, the price of Litecoin surged to $140. However, the LTC price crashed in February as it dropped toward the low of $80. In March, the price of LTC consolidated below $90 after failing to break the $100 resistance. By the end of April, LTC price surged toward the $88 but struggled to maintain that level in early May.

2025-07-05T15:25:29,"Veteran Trader to XRP Holders: You Are Not Bullish Enough. Here’s Why","Veteran crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto has sparked renewed optimism in the XRP community with a bold assertion: “You are not bullish enough.” In a recent post on X, CrediBULL pointed to XRP’s strong and sustained technical positioning as evidence that most traders are drastically underestimating what could be a massive upcoming move. With XRP now entering its eighth consecutive month of consolidation above a key historical level, his statement has struck a chord across the crypto space. A Clean, Impulsive Rally from $0.50 CrediBULL highlights a critical detail that sets XRP apart from nearly every altcoin in the market: its clear and impulsive price action since rebounding from the $0.50 level. In technical terms, an impulsive move is the beginning of a strong bullish trend, often serving as the first leg of a multi-wave rally. According to CrediBULL, XRP and Bitcoin are currently the only major coins exhibiting such clean impulsive structures , a rare and powerful signal in a market often dominated by erratic volatility. Aside from being one of the only coins in this entire market with the clearest/cleanest impulsive PA (aside from $BTC ) starting at it's launch off of .50, $XRP is currently going on it's EIGHTH month of consolidation above the prior ATH monthly close. You Are Not … https://t.co/sM4zJgK378 pic.twitter.com/EucpQZVaLF — CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) July 5, 2025 Since breaking above $0.50, XRP has demonstrated disciplined, wave-based movements that suggest accumulation rather than speculation. This behavior is not just bullish, it’s foundational. It means smart money could be quietly positioning ahead of a major breakout that retail investors have yet to fully price in. Consolidating Above a Major Historical Benchmark Perhaps even more telling than its wave structure is XRP’s current location on the chart. The asset has now spent eight months consolidating above its previous all-time high (ATH) monthly close, a level that capped XRP’s price in the 2017 bull run and again during much of the 2020–2021 cycle. In the world of technical analysis, this kind of sustained price action above a former ATH monthly close is highly significant. It signals that the market has re-evaluated the asset, converting long-standing resistance into solid support. For XRP, which has faced regulatory pressure and years of suppressed price action, this prolonged consolidation suggests a coiled spring preparing for release.

Many traders remain skeptical, possibly due to the coin’s long and frustrating legal battle with the SEC. But with that case moving close to fresolution, the fundamental picture for XRP has never been clearer. CrediBULL argues that this sentiment lag is precisely what makes the current setup so powerful. While most of the market looks elsewhere, XRP has quietly built a base above a critical level, supported by a clean price structure and strengthening fundamentals, including Ripple’s expanding global reach, the integration of RLUSD, and regulatory clarity in key jurisdictions. Final Thoughts CrediBULL Crypto’s message is clear: XRP holders may be significantly underestimating what lies ahead. With technicals, sentiment, and fundamentals aligning, XRP is positioned for a potential breakout of historic proportions. For those still sitting on the sidelines or doubting the setup, the veteran trader’s warning couldn’t be more timely, this may be the calm before an explosive storm.

Cardano and XRP whales are now taking notice, as the project’s PayFi innovation opens up an entirely new world for real-world crypto adoption. What Makes PayFi Stand Out From ADA & XRP Remittix’s PayFi allows crypto holders to move BTC, ETH or XRP to traditional bank accounts in four and a half minutes. That bridge to the physical world is what XRP and Cardano have been reaching for, but Remittix seems to be there first. Cardano is trading at $0.5761, down by 4.12% with volume down by 50.24%. XRP also fell by 2.37% to $2.21, volume down 54.2%. The two cryptocurrencies have long touted mass adoption with seamless payments but now are at risk of being displaced by a leaner and faster model. Remittix, for its part, is already conducting full wallet flight testing and hopes to formally launch in Q3 2025. Why Whales Are Taking Remittix Seriously Whales prefer to track utility not buzz. And Remittix has aplenty. With over 547 million tokens already sold, an active presale at $0.0811 and an active 50% token bonus, large investors are considering gigantic upside potential. The project is seeking an $18M soft cap and having already received $15.9M+, it’s close to reaching that goal in a hurry. But what really makes it stand out is that it doesn’t merely guarantee cross-border payments, it does them. Whereas Cardano’s ongoing-building ecosystem or XRP’s perpetual fight against regulations, Remittix is giving consumers an instant use case anybody can comprehend: send crypto, get fiat. Can Remittix Catch Up with XRP And Cardano? If trends continue the way they are, it might. The demand for fast, efficient and global payment systems is growing rapidly. XRP and ADA helped create the early narrative on crypto utility and Remittix is turning that utility into reality with minimal friction. Remittix’s whitepaper has goals for global expansion and its product is already in functional test stages. That’s greater than several layer-1s or cross-border coins in the same tier. Investors are now wondering: if Remittix can do in one click what XRP and ADA have only dreamed about, why risk being short on the newer project? A Real Chance At The Top 10? Remittix isn’t some pretty-looking site coin. It’s a full payment system with real-world usage. By touching upon the crossroads between crypto and fiat, it’s addressing one of the biggest problems in crypto adoption today. As PayFi continues to gain steam and as whales continue to pour in, Remittix could threaten the very foundations that ADA and XRP were established on. If it continues to gain strength on this trajectory throughout Q3 and onwards, it would not be so surprising for Remittix (RTX) to climb into the top 10 crypto rankings.

Analysts note that since breaking above the $0.50 level, it has shown one of the strongest and clearest uptrends. Among major cryptocurrencies, only Bitcoin displays a more established and solid market structure. The monthly XRP chart is quietly showing strength. Historically, the $1.90–$2.00 zone has served as a key resistance level. But in 2024, XRP decisively broke above $2 and since then, the price has stabilized and is holding steady above it.

You Are Not … https://t.co/sM4zJgK378 pic.twitter.com/EucpQZVaLF — CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) July 5, 2025 Analyst Predicts Bitcoin to Surge Beyond $30 XRP has firmly remained above the $1.90 mark for more than eight consecutive months. With price holding steady and low volatility, the pressure is building. When assets move like this, major breakouts often follow. According to Elliott Wave theory , XRP is all set to enter a strong upward trend. This means that we could see the price rise through five distinct waves, pushing it beyond $30 by mid-2026. Multiple Drivers Behind XRP’s Growth Analys t Vincent Code also predicts that XRP could hit $30–$50. He cited several reasons for XRP’s rise. RippleNet could capture 20–30% of the $1 trillion cross-border payments market. More than 50 countries may adopt XRP for CBDC bridges. A big crypto bull run in 2026–2027 could spark strong market excitement. Demand for RLUSD is also growing. Further, Ripple’s 2024 agreement with Saudi Arabia’s central bank could pave the way for XRP to be used in oil-related settlements. He also expects that an XRP Spot ETF approval could bring $20–$50 billion in institutional investments. Analyst MelarinX says that XRP is coiling like a spring and quietly building energy before a big breakout. Davinci Jeremie , a Bitcoin proponent has also made a U-turn and predicted that XRP could possibly hit $24 this year. He cited that many people in the US government are “pushing for XRP.” XRP at a Crucial Price Crossroad XRP is currently trading at $2.23. It is stuck in a tight range, and key moving averages are closing in. This kind of setup often comes before a big, sudden move. Both upward and downward moves are possible. Nevertheless, XRP’s strong bullish setup and the growing institutional interest, like Ripple’s U.S. bank license bid and ETF talks, are keeping the long-term optimism alive.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrps-tight-range-signals-imminent-move-experts-predict-major-breakout/,"XRP|TRADING|MARKET|BTC|FIAT","News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare
2025-07-05T15:06:21,"Bitcoin (BTC) breakout delayed: Will it still happen?","Bitcoin (BTC) rose out of its bull flag on Thursday, and for all intents and purposes looked as though it might be able to consolidate above. However, the bears had other ideas, and not only forced the price back to the upper trendline, but drove it back inside the flag. Is this just a postponement of the breakout, or could the price be brought lower still? Is $BTC going to break out or not? Source: TradingView The short-term chart for $BTC shows a fakeout of the bull flag. When the price was over $110,000 on Thursday this was probably the last thing that the bulls expected. That said, $BTC was becoming overbought, and once the first breakout confirmation had been made, and the price rolled over again, the bulls suddenly lost their nerve and the price receded back into the bull flag. One further bearish factor that will give the bulls food for thought is that the surge out of the bull flag did not put in a higher high. It got pretty close, but pretty close still isn’t a higher high. On the more positive side of things, the overbought condition for $BTC is resetting as the Stochastic RSI indicators on the 4-hour time frame have now hit the bottom. Having said that, the 8-hour and 12-hour Stochastic RSIs still have a way to go, and might even start turning up before they get to the bottom. $106,000 important level to hold Source: TradingView The daily chart reveals that the price is still above the $106,000 support. This is an important level because it marks the top of some candle bodies from December 2024 through to January 2025. If this level continues to hold, the breakout and fakeout of the bull flag could just be a momentary setback. Weekly close crucial for deciding next week’s price direction Source: TradingView The 4 of July holiday in the United States may have had something to do with the lacklustre trading of $BTC on Friday. Be that as it may, looking at the macro picture, the surge out of the falling wedge pattern has turned into a classic bull flag, and it might be expected that this plays out to the upside, even if it does take a while longer. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI indicators are still sitting on a knife edge. Any positive or negative price action over this weekend could tip the scales in either direction. The ideal situation for the bulls would be for a confirmed cross back up at the end of Sunday. If this doesn’t take place, expect at least another week of sideways price action.

2025-07-05T14:30:09,"US Bond Holders Abruptly Sell $10,000,000,000+ in Treasuries and Corporate Debt Amid Fears of US Fiscal Fallout: Report","Investors are selling billions of dollars of US bonds in a dramatic turnaround signaling fears over America’s fiscal future, according to a new report. Nearly $11 billion in long-term bonds and corporate debt has been dumped in just three months, reports the Financial Times. The Q2 2025 selloff ends a five year run of net inflows into long-term US bond funds, with the previous selloff happening back in the first quarter of 2020. PGIM’s top fixed income strategist Robert Tipp says the shift shows investors are wary of rising inflation and increasing government debt. “It’s a volatile environment, with inflation still above target and heavy government supply as far as the eye can see. This is driving a skittishness about the long end of the yield curve, and a general uneasiness.” The news comes amid the passing of President Trump’s “big beautiful” spending bill, which raises the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, extends 2017 tax cuts permanently, boosts spending on defense and border security, cuts parts of Medicaid and SNAP programs, eliminates clean energy tax credits, and introduces tax exemptions for tips and overtime. Although the impact of the legislation is highly contested by the Trump administration, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates the bill will add approximately $3.5 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says he believes the bill will ignite unprecedented economic growth and offset the deficit through increased revenue, while establishing the US as the global leader in manufacturing and job creation.

2025-07-05T14:29:24,"Grayscale Reacts to SEC Action On XRP ETF","Grayscale Investments has responded to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) sudden decision to delay the launch of its Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) as an exchange-traded fund (ETF), describing the move as unexpected and indicative of a rapidly evolving regulatory climate. The announcement came in an email to Decrypt on Thursday, sparking broader conversations about the SEC’s shifting stance on crypto investment products, particularly those involving XRP. SEC Pauses GDLC ETF Launch Despite Early Approval The SEC initially fast-tracked Grayscale’s application to convert its GDLC product into a spot ETF. The fund, which primarily focuses on Bitcoin, also provides diversified exposure to Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Cardano. While the regulator had previously moved swiftly in greenlighting the conversion process, it halted progress just before allowing the ETF to begin trading. Grayscale called the move surprising but framed it as part of a broader pattern. “While this development was not anticipated, it highlights the dynamic nature of the regulatory landscape for first-of-its-kind products like GDLC,” the company said. GDLC: A Diversified Crypto Investment Vehicle The GDLC fund is modeled on the CoinDesk 5 Index, which tracks the performance of the five largest and most liquid cryptocurrencies. According to the SEC filing, GDLC’s holdings include over 80% in Bitcoin, 11% in Ethereum, 4.8% in XRP, 2.8% in Solana, and 0.8% in Cardano. By offering investors a single product that spreads exposure across top-tier digital assets, GDLC aims to simplify access to the crypto market. The planned ETF listing was set to bring added liquidity and market efficiency compared to the original closed-end structure. Grayscale Vows to Push Forward Despite the regulatory holdup, Grayscale reaffirmed its commitment to listing GDLC as a full-fledged ETF. “We are actively working with key stakeholders to meet all requirements,” the firm said, promising to keep the public updated as new information becomes available. Grayscale has already successfully converted both its Bitcoin and Ethereum trusts into ETFs. These conversions helped solve pricing inefficiencies caused by their closed-end fund structures, which often led to significant discounts or premiums. SEC’s Evolving Approach to Crypto ETFs The SEC’s decision underscores its cautious yet shifting attitude toward crypto ETFs. While the agency now appears more receptive to funds centered on major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, it continues to withhold approval for ETFs that focus solely on mid-cap coins like XRP, Solana, or Cardano. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Instead, the regulator has shown greater openness to diversified funds that include a mix of these altcoins, provided Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the dominant components. This nuanced approach suggests that while XRP isn’t off-limits, it still carries regulatory uncertainty when standing alone. Court Battle with the SEC Set the Stage Grayscale’s ongoing pursuit of ETF approval comes on the heels of a major legal victory against the SEC in 2023. After several rejections, Grayscale sued the agency, and a U.S. appellate court ruled in its favor, criticizing the SEC’s inconsistent reasoning when approving futures-based ETFs but denying spot products. That legal win was instrumental in forcing the SEC to revisit its position and ultimately approve spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have since attracted nearly $50 billion in inflows. Spot Ethereum ETFs followed suit, pulling in around $4 billion to date. What It Means for XRP and the Road Ahead Although XRP remains a small component of GDLC, the SEC’s refusal to greenlight the fund’s launch highlights the lingering regulatory headwinds surrounding the asset. The decision doesn’t amount to an outright rejection of XRP in ETFs, but it does reflect the SEC’s reluctance to move forward with products that heavily emphasize altcoins outside Bitcoin and Ethereum. For now, Grayscale remains undeterred. The firm sees GDLC as a milestone product—one that could shape the future of crypto exposure in traditional finance. As regulatory signals continue to shift, the industry will be watching closely to see whether XRP, and altcoins like it, will eventually gain equal footing in the ETF space.

2025-07-05T14:09:17,"OKX promises fix to risk flagging system that wrongly tags users","Crypto exchange OKX has pledged improvements to its information collection process after its system mistakenly flagged normal users as risky. In a Saturday X post , the exchange apologized for its mishap, conceding that its compliance and risk systems still grapple with false positives and operational shortcomings. The exchange, however, claimed it is working to improve its risk control processes promptly. OKX says it performs checks on its employees as well In its X post, OKX also detailed the necessity of its compliance and risk control systems and what they mean for users. It explained that the processes are vital to ensure the platform remains free from illicit use and meets the required compliance laws. The exchange also asserted that it vets its staff and upholds a zero-tolerance stance on misconduct, including spreading disinformation, engaging in insider activities, or undermining user rights. It added that it has several internal monitoring checks to help spot infractions and take action promptly. For its clients, the exchange stated that its systems perform identity verification (KYC checks), monitor transactions, screen against sanctions lists, and detect potential market manipulation. It also incorporates third-party databases with proprietary behavioral models to help identify suspicious or risky accounts. Should an account be verified to have breached legal requirements or user agreements, the exchange responds by issuing notices, requesting additional information, suspending certain features, or closing the account permanently. However, if a user’s account is tied to sanctions or terrorism, the exchange will freeze their assets. OKX acknowledges false positives and asks users not to worry The exchange, however, revealed that its compliance and risk control systems are not 100% accurate, having flagged several normal users as risky. The exchange argued that many service providers typically use an aggressive play in identification checks, driven partly by regulatory guidance recommending prudence in risk oversight. As a result, even fully compliant users with normal activity may occasionally receive additional information requests from the compliance team. The notice also claimed that platforms evaluate customer risk levels on multiple factors. If one’s account is found to be high risk, more investigation into where the funds originate is conducted. The exchange, nevertheless, acknowledged that false positives are an issue in any compliance system. It further commented, “We are continuously improving the user experience for submitting documents after triggering risk controls. If you are asked to provide information such as the source of funds, proof of address, or past employment details, please don’t worry—just submit the information truthfully.” It also assured users that as long as they are not involved in any criminal activity, their account and funds will not be affected, and the platform is still obligated to protect their privacy. One X user, however, accused OKX of maliciously freezing user account funds and excessively collecting user privacy information. He explained that the exchange had asked for more information multiple times and even froze about 10,000 USDT in his account. He claimed he contacted the platform’s customer service and submitted tickets, which led to more inquiries about his work history and residential addresses. From his experience, he concluded that the exchange only wanted to trouble its consumers, saying it should be a wake-up call to everyone. He claimed the exchange starts by asking for additional info and then moves on to ask for more repeatedly before eventually freezing your account and rejecting your application.

2025-07-05T13:32:45,"XRP to ‘trigger a major move’ if this level is breached","As the price of XRP experiences notable volatility around the $2.20 mark, technical indicators suggest that a move above this level could trigger a significant rally. To this end, cryptocurrency trading expert Ali Martinez has identified the $2.38 mark as the key barrier preventing XRP from a major breakout, according to a July 4 post on X. Martinez arrived at this target by analyzing XRP’s UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) chart, which shows $2.38 as the highest concentration of previously transacted XRP, representing over 2.75 billion tokens, or 4.33% of the total supply. XRP URPD chart. Source: Glassnode The URPD metric, which tracks the price levels where tokens were last moved, indicates strong resistance at $2.38, as many holders may look to sell or break even at that point. However, the analyst believes a decisive break above $2.38 could “trigger a major move” by clearing both psychological and technical resistance levels. Such a breakout would invalidate significant overhead supply and potentially usher in renewed bullish momentum. Martinez also noted strong support between $0.50 and $1.80, particularly below the $1 level. Still, the key challenge remains the $2.38 zone, which has remained untested since XRP’s all-time highs. XRP price in consolidation Meanwhile, analyst CrediBULL Crypto emphasized XRP’s potential for a breakout in a July 5 X post. He pointed out that XRP is entering its eighth consecutive month of consolidation above its previous all-time high monthly close, an important technical milestone. This sustained price action above a former resistance-turned-support area signals growing strength and maturity. Aside from being one of the only coins in this entire market with the clearest/cleanest impulsive PA (aside from $BTC ) starting at it's launch off of .50, $XRP is currently going on it's EIGHTH month of consolidation above the prior ATH monthly close. You 👏 Are 👏 Not 👏… https://t.co/sM4zJgK378 pic.twitter.com/EucpQZVaLF — CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) July 5, 2025 The analyst added that the ongoing consolidation, following a sharp breakout, suggests XRP may be preparing for another strong upward move. If confirmed, it could mark a new bullish impulse, further cementing XRP’s status as one of the most technically resilient digital assets. XRP price analysis At press time, XRP was trading at $2.22, down about 0.7% in the last 24 hours. On the weekly chart, the asset is up 1.44%. XRP one-week price chart. Source: Finbold Currently, XRP is slightly below its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $2.25, suggesting mild short-term weakness.

Insider Credentials Sold for $2,700 According to Brazilian newspaper São Paulo, the attack began when a C&M employee exchanged their login credentials for approximately $2,700. The credentials granted the attackers entry into the systems of C&M, which link the Central Bank with domestic banks. The hackers targeted six institutions and withdrew cash from reserve accounts. One C&M employee suspected of making the breach possible through selling their access credentials has been detained by Brazilian police. $30M–$40M Cleaned via Crypto Blockchain analyst ZachXBT reported that the hackers instantly moved $30 million to $40 million to Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and USDt (USDT). Those assets were cleaned via Latin American crypto exchanges and over-the-counter (OTC) desks. The use of crypto for laundering is pointing towards increasing overlap among traditional finance systems and blockchain-based technologies in cybercrime operations. Centralized Systems Susceptible to AI-Era Threats The breach is a wake-up call to growing fear surrounding centralized software networks . Professionals say such networks are vulnerable to insider threats, ransomware, and exploits — particularly in a world where AI tools can be leveraged by cybercriminals to help them identify and breach such networks. Shielded Technologies CEO Eran Barak explained that hackers view centralized platforms as “massive ROI targets” due to the quantity of sensitive data and money that they hold. Decentralization as a Defense Barak demonstrated that decentralized blockchain systems, such as those utilizing zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), provide a less appealing target in that the hackers would need to break individual wallets rather than a central database. “If you can only access one account at a time, the payoff isn’t worth the risk,” Barak said.",btcpulse,https://btc-pulse.com/brazils-central-bank-service-provider-hacked-140m/,"FIAT|BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY|BTC|ETH","Blockchain|Sticky|Web3",cryptocompare
