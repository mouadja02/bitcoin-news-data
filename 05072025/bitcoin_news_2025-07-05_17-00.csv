According to the latest data, U.S.-listed spot Ethereum ETFs have logged $148.57 million in net inflows in a single day, the second-highest since February. With the 8-week inflow total nearing $2 billion, market confidence in Ethereum’s long-term value appears to be growing. +$148.5 million into the ETH ETFs today.

If macro factors turn risk-off, ETH could face increased pressure from both retail and leveraged traders. Bullish Setups Could Trigger a $3,500 Breakout Still, not all signals are bearish. Ethereum is currently testing the base of a rising parallel channel near $2,474. On lower timeframes, the asset is printing higher highs and higher lows—a bullish structure that remains intact as long as $2,474 holds. Ethereum Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Additionally, a multi-year symmetrical pennant is developing, with Ethereum now in wave D of the pattern. If ETH breaks above the $2,855 neckline of its inverse head and shoulders formation, it could unleash strong upside momentum, potentially reaching $3,500–$6,000. Trade Setup for Beginners: Entry: $2,490–$2,520 on a bullish candle Targets: $2,562 → $2,640 Stop-Loss: Below $2,460 MACD: Bearish divergence; needs price confirmation Ethereum price prediction is at a technical crossroads. For bulls, $2,474 is the line in the sand. A break above $2,855 would be a big win. Until then, patience and discipline are key.

2025-07-05T14:30:16,"Bitcoin Price Could Resume Uptrend If $105,000 Support Holds — Here’s How","The Bitcoin price failed to stay above the $110,000 level on Friday, July 4, despite the positive jobs data in the United States. The flagship cryptocurrency has returned to around the $107,000 level, mirroring the current indecisive state of the broader crypto market. While the Bitcoin price has been moving largely within a range in the past few weeks, it has enjoyed enough bullish support to stay in touching distance of its record high of $111,814. Below is how $105,000 might be the next critical support for the market leader. Analyst Explains Why $105,000 Might Be A Crucial Support Prominent on-chain analyst Burak Kesmeci took to the social media platform X to share his latest evaluation of the Bitcoin price. According to the online crypto pundit, the price of BTC is more likely to witness upward momentum so long as it stays above the $105,799 crucial support over the next few weeks. This prediction is based on Realized Price UTXO Age Bands, which estimates the average price at which Bitcoin holders purchased their BTC relative to the duration they’ve held their coins. Specifically, Kesmeci highlighted the 1-week to 1-month age band (green line) as the one to watch. Considering its short duration, this age band offers insight into “short-term holders’ behavior and, potentially, the overall market sentiment . As shown in the chart above, this age band served as a significant support cushion for the flagship cryptocurrency as recently as June 1, 2025. As of the time of publishing the post on X, the 1-week to 1-month age band was around the $105,799 region, meaning that the price of BTC could rely on this level for support. The rationale behind this prognosis is that STH, with their cost basis around $105,799, are likely to defend their positions by purchasing more coins when Bitcoin price returns to this level, leading to the formation of a support cushion and keeping the price afloat. Kesmeci noted that investors can expect to see further positive price movement so long as Bitcoin stays above the $105,799 support level. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC sits just above $108,100, reflecting an over 1% decline in the past 24 hours. Despite reaching a seven-day high of $110,300 and a low of around $105,430, the premier cryptocurrency is now back around where it started the week. According to data from CoinGecko, the Bitcoin price is up by a mere 1% on the weekly timeframe.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-could-resume-uptrend-105000-support/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin price|Bitcoin’s Realized Cap - UTXO Age Bands|btc|btc price|BTCUSDT",cryptocompare
2025-07-05T14:30:09,"US Bond Holders Abruptly Dump ~$11,000,000,000 in Treasuries and Corporate Debt Amid Fears of US Fiscal Fallout: Report","Investors are selling billions of dollars of US bonds in a dramatic turnaround signaling fears over America’s fiscal future, according to a new report. Nearly $11 billion in long-term bonds and corporate debt has been dumped in just three months, reports the Financial Times. The Q2 2025 selloff ends a five year run of net inflows into long-term US bond funds, with the previous selloff happening back in the first quarter of 2020. PGIM’s top fixed income strategist Robert Tipp says the shift shows investors are wary of rising inflation and increasing government debt. “It’s a volatile environment, with inflation still above target and heavy government supply as far as the eye can see. This is driving a skittishness about the long end of the yield curve, and a general uneasiness.” The news comes amid the passing of President Trump’s “big beautiful” spending bill, which raises the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, extends 2017 tax cuts permanently, boosts spending on defense and border security, cuts parts of Medicaid and SNAP programs, eliminates clean energy tax credits, and introduces tax exemptions for tips and overtime. Although the impact of the legislation is highly contested by the Trump administration, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates the bill will add approximately $3.5 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says he believes the bill will ignite unprecedented economic growth and offset the deficit through increased revenue, while establishing the US as the global leader in manufacturing and job creation.

2025-07-05T14:29:24,"Grayscale Reacts to SEC Action On XRP ETF","Grayscale Investments has responded to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) sudden decision to delay the launch of its Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) as an exchange-traded fund (ETF), describing the move as unexpected and indicative of a rapidly evolving regulatory climate. The announcement came in an email to Decrypt on Thursday, sparking broader conversations about the SEC’s shifting stance on crypto investment products, particularly those involving XRP. SEC Pauses GDLC ETF Launch Despite Early Approval The SEC initially fast-tracked Grayscale’s application to convert its GDLC product into a spot ETF. The fund, which primarily focuses on Bitcoin, also provides diversified exposure to Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Cardano. While the regulator had previously moved swiftly in greenlighting the conversion process, it halted progress just before allowing the ETF to begin trading. Grayscale called the move surprising but framed it as part of a broader pattern. “While this development was not anticipated, it highlights the dynamic nature of the regulatory landscape for first-of-its-kind products like GDLC,” the company said. GDLC: A Diversified Crypto Investment Vehicle The GDLC fund is modeled on the CoinDesk 5 Index, which tracks the performance of the five largest and most liquid cryptocurrencies. According to the SEC filing, GDLC’s holdings include over 80% in Bitcoin, 11% in Ethereum, 4.8% in XRP, 2.8% in Solana, and 0.8% in Cardano. By offering investors a single product that spreads exposure across top-tier digital assets, GDLC aims to simplify access to the crypto market. The planned ETF listing was set to bring added liquidity and market efficiency compared to the original closed-end structure. Grayscale Vows to Push Forward Despite the regulatory holdup, Grayscale reaffirmed its commitment to listing GDLC as a full-fledged ETF. “We are actively working with key stakeholders to meet all requirements,” the firm said, promising to keep the public updated as new information becomes available. Grayscale has already successfully converted both its Bitcoin and Ethereum trusts into ETFs. These conversions helped solve pricing inefficiencies caused by their closed-end fund structures, which often led to significant discounts or premiums. SEC’s Evolving Approach to Crypto ETFs The SEC’s decision underscores its cautious yet shifting attitude toward crypto ETFs. While the agency now appears more receptive to funds centered on major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, it continues to withhold approval for ETFs that focus solely on mid-cap coins like XRP, Solana, or Cardano. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Instead, the regulator has shown greater openness to diversified funds that include a mix of these altcoins, provided Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the dominant components. This nuanced approach suggests that while XRP isn’t off-limits, it still carries regulatory uncertainty when standing alone. Court Battle with the SEC Set the Stage Grayscale’s ongoing pursuit of ETF approval comes on the heels of a major legal victory against the SEC in 2023. After several rejections, Grayscale sued the agency, and a U.S. appellate court ruled in its favor, criticizing the SEC’s inconsistent reasoning when approving futures-based ETFs but denying spot products. That legal win was instrumental in forcing the SEC to revisit its position and ultimately approve spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have since attracted nearly $50 billion in inflows. Spot Ethereum ETFs followed suit, pulling in around $4 billion to date. What It Means for XRP and the Road Ahead Although XRP remains a small component of GDLC, the SEC’s refusal to greenlight the fund’s launch highlights the lingering regulatory headwinds surrounding the asset. The decision doesn’t amount to an outright rejection of XRP in ETFs, but it does reflect the SEC’s reluctance to move forward with products that heavily emphasize altcoins outside Bitcoin and Ethereum. For now, Grayscale remains undeterred. The firm sees GDLC as a milestone product—one that could shape the future of crypto exposure in traditional finance. As regulatory signals continue to shift, the industry will be watching closely to see whether XRP, and altcoins like it, will eventually gain equal footing in the ETF space.

If it is well done, and if it is well implemented, it would be of service to all citizens,” Lagarde stated. In a notable reference, Lagarde further highlighted that the digital Euro will copy the implementation style of China with the Digital Yuan.

2025-07-05T14:09:17,"OKX promises fix to risk flagging system that wrongly tags users","Crypto exchange OKX has pledged improvements to its information collection process after its system mistakenly flagged normal users as risky. In a Saturday X post , the exchange apologized for its mishap, conceding that its compliance and risk systems still grapple with false positives and operational shortcomings. The exchange, however, claimed it is working to improve its risk control processes promptly. OKX says it performs checks on its employees as well In its X post, OKX also detailed the necessity of its compliance and risk control systems and what they mean for users. It explained that the processes are vital to ensure the platform remains free from illicit use and meets the required compliance laws. The exchange also asserted that it vets its staff and upholds a zero-tolerance stance on misconduct, including spreading disinformation, engaging in insider activities, or undermining user rights. It added that it has several internal monitoring checks to help spot infractions and take action promptly. For its clients, the exchange stated that its systems perform identity verification (KYC checks), monitor transactions, screen against sanctions lists, and detect potential market manipulation. It also incorporates third-party databases with proprietary behavioral models to help identify suspicious or risky accounts. Should an account be verified to have breached legal requirements or user agreements, the exchange responds by issuing notices, requesting additional information, suspending certain features, or closing the account permanently. However, if a user’s account is tied to sanctions or terrorism, the exchange will freeze their assets. OKX acknowledges false positives and asks users not to worry The exchange, however, revealed that its compliance and risk control systems are not 100% accurate, having flagged several normal users as risky. The exchange argued that many service providers typically use an aggressive play in identification checks, driven partly by regulatory guidance recommending prudence in risk oversight. As a result, even fully compliant users with normal activity may occasionally receive additional information requests from the compliance team. The notice also claimed that platforms evaluate customer risk levels on multiple factors. If one’s account is found to be high risk, more investigation into where the funds originate is conducted. The exchange, nevertheless, acknowledged that false positives are an issue in any compliance system. It further commented, “We are continuously improving the user experience for submitting documents after triggering risk controls. If you are asked to provide information such as the source of funds, proof of address, or past employment details, please don’t worry—just submit the information truthfully.” It also assured users that as long as they are not involved in any criminal activity, their account and funds will not be affected, and the platform is still obligated to protect their privacy. One X user, however, accused OKX of maliciously freezing user account funds and excessively collecting user privacy information. He explained that the exchange had asked for more information multiple times and even froze about 10,000 USDT in his account. He claimed he contacted the platform’s customer service and submitted tickets, which led to more inquiries about his work history and residential addresses. From his experience, he concluded that the exchange only wanted to trouble its consumers, saying it should be a wake-up call to everyone. He claimed the exchange starts by asking for additional info and then moves on to ask for more repeatedly before eventually freezing your account and rejecting your application.

2025-07-05T13:32:45,"XRP to ‘trigger a major move’ if this level is breached","As the price of XRP experiences notable volatility around the $2.20 mark, technical indicators suggest that a move above this level could trigger a significant rally. To this end, cryptocurrency trading expert Ali Martinez has identified the $2.38 mark as the key barrier preventing XRP from a major breakout, according to a July 4 post on X. Martinez arrived at this target by analyzing XRP’s UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) chart, which shows $2.38 as the highest concentration of previously transacted XRP, representing over 2.75 billion tokens, or 4.33% of the total supply. XRP URPD chart. Source: Glassnode The URPD metric, which tracks the price levels where tokens were last moved, indicates strong resistance at $2.38, as many holders may look to sell or break even at that point. However, the analyst believes a decisive break above $2.38 could “trigger a major move” by clearing both psychological and technical resistance levels. Such a breakout would invalidate significant overhead supply and potentially usher in renewed bullish momentum. Martinez also noted strong support between $0.50 and $1.80, particularly below the $1 level. Still, the key challenge remains the $2.38 zone, which has remained untested since XRP’s all-time highs. XRP price in consolidation Meanwhile, analyst CrediBULL Crypto emphasized XRP’s potential for a breakout in a July 5 X post. He pointed out that XRP is entering its eighth consecutive month of consolidation above its previous all-time high monthly close, an important technical milestone. This sustained price action above a former resistance-turned-support area signals growing strength and maturity. Aside from being one of the only coins in this entire market with the clearest/cleanest impulsive PA (aside from $BTC ) starting at it's launch off of .50, $XRP is currently going on it's EIGHTH month of consolidation above the prior ATH monthly close.

If confirmed, it could mark a new bullish impulse, further cementing XRP’s status as one of the most technically resilient digital assets.

Insider Credentials Sold for $2,700 According to Brazilian newspaper São Paulo, the attack began when a C&M employee exchanged their login credentials for approximately $2,700. The credentials granted the attackers entry into the systems of C&M, which link the Central Bank with domestic banks. The hackers targeted six institutions and withdrew cash from reserve accounts. One C&M employee suspected of making the breach possible through selling their access credentials has been detained by Brazilian police. $30M–$40M Cleaned via Crypto Blockchain analyst ZachXBT reported that the hackers instantly moved $30 million to $40 million to Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and USDt (USDT). Those assets were cleaned via Latin American crypto exchanges and over-the-counter (OTC) desks. The use of crypto for laundering is pointing towards increasing overlap among traditional finance systems and blockchain-based technologies in cybercrime operations. Centralized Systems Susceptible to AI-Era Threats The breach is a wake-up call to growing fear surrounding centralized software networks . Professionals say such networks are vulnerable to insider threats, ransomware, and exploits — particularly in a world where AI tools can be leveraged by cybercriminals to help them identify and breach such networks. Shielded Technologies CEO Eran Barak explained that hackers view centralized platforms as “massive ROI targets” due to the quantity of sensitive data and money that they hold. Decentralization as a Defense Barak demonstrated that decentralized blockchain systems, such as those utilizing zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), provide a less appealing target in that the hackers would need to break individual wallets rather than a central database. “If you can only access one account at a time, the payoff isn’t worth the risk,” Barak said.",btcpulse,https://btc-pulse.com/brazils-central-bank-service-provider-hacked-140m/,"FIAT|BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY|BTC|ETH","Blockchain|Sticky|Web3",cryptocompare

A jury in California has found the tech giant must pay damages for transferring data from idle Android smartphones without authorization, reports Reuters. Google says it will appeal the decision, which the lawsuit claims triggered “mandatory and unavoidable burdens shouldered by Android device users for Google’s benefit.” The jury found the data transfers violated California’s privacy laws, and the money will be handed exclusively to users in the state. According to the lawsuit, which was initiated in 2019, the company used customers’ cellular data to transfer information that was used for things like targeted advertising. In court, Google argued that the transfers were fully legal and covered by the company’s privacy policies and terms of service, and no users were harmed in any way. After the verdict was announced, Google spokesperson Jose Castaneda said the jury’s decision “misunderstands services that are critical to the security, performance, and reliability of Android devices.” Google is also facing a lawsuit on the transfers that represent customers in the rest of the country, which is set to start in the first half of next year.

2025-07-05T13:15:55,"Analyst to XRP Holders: XRP Mega Breakout Incoming","In a recent post that has stirred excitement across the crypto community, STEPH IS CRYPTO, a prominent analyst on X, issued a bold proclamation: a “mega breakout” is incoming for XRP. With XRP trading just above $2.20, mounting technical signals and broader market dynamics are aligning to suggest a major move could be imminent. Technical Compression Suggests Imminent Explosion Steph’s analysis centers around a well-defined descending triangle pattern on XRP’s 3-day chart, stretching back to January 2025. This formation, known for forecasting volatile breakouts once price compresses into a tight range, has seen XRP repeatedly test support above $2.00 while facing resistance around $2.33. According to Steph, the key signal to watch is a daily close above $2.33. If confirmed, it could trigger a sustained rally that breaks the current consolidation. Volume indicators support this view. Declining volume within the triangle suggests market indecision, but historically, this leads to explosive price action once momentum returns. #XRP MEGA breakout incoming! pic.twitter.com/ZTHaEXGgd4 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) July 5, 2025 Projected Price Targets: From $5 to Over $30 Using Fibonacci extensions drawn from XRP’s 2024 low to its January 2025 high, Steph outlined a series of ambitious but technically grounded price targets. The first leg, projected at $5.38, represents the 0.618 Fibonacci extension, a common target in early bullish waves. If momentum accelerates, further price levels at $11.31, $23.78, and even $37.63 come into view. Steph has consistently maintained that these projections are not short-term predictions, but part of a broader multi-leg breakout that could unfold over weeks or months. Patience, he notes, is essential. Monthly Chart Breakout on the Horizon The long-term setup also strengthens the bullish narrative. On the monthly chart, XRP appears to be forming a symmetrical triangle , with an apex estimated between early July and mid-September. This coincides with the timing window Steph referenced in previous updates. The importance of this setup cannot be overstated, historically, symmetrical triangles on higher time frames tend to precede prolonged directional moves. Key resistance zones sit between $2.40 and $2.69, which coincide with the 100-day and 200-day simple moving averages. A clean breakout above this region could see XRP reclaim $3.00 quickly, setting the stage for a move toward its all-time high of $3.40. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Broader Market and Regulatory Tailwinds Outside of technicals, broader market dynamics may serve as catalysts. Regulatory clarity is improving, especially following Ripple’s legal progress in its battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Combined with the increasing adoption of RLUSD and Ripple’s U.S. bank charter application, institutional sentiment around XRP appears to be turning positive. Steph and other analysts also point to the current macro cycle in crypto. With Bitcoin recently breaking new highs and altcoins starting to rotate into the spotlight, XRP’s timing for a breakout could hardly be better. Caution Still Warranted Despite the optimistic outlook, risks remain. There is a notable liquidity block around $2.00, representing a large sell wall. If price rejects from resistance and breaks below support zones like $2.06 or $1.95, the bullish setup could be invalidated or delayed. Traders and investors should watch these levels closely. A Moment of Truth for XRP With converging technical signals, supportive market sentiment, and macro tailwinds, XRP appears primed for what STEPH IS CRYPTO calls a “mega breakout.” The $2.33 level is the line in the sand, clear it, and XRP could be on a fast track to its most significant rally since 2017. For holders, the next few weeks may prove pivotal. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

2025-07-05T13:07:00,"Glassnode’s James Check Warns Bitcoin Treasury Boom Could Be Short-Lived","Glassnode lead analyst James Check has raised concerns over the longevity of the corporate Bitcoin treasury strategy, arguing the easy gains might already be gone for new entrants as the market matures. Key Takeaways: Glassnode’s James Check warns the Bitcoin treasury strategy may have limited upside left. Early movers like Michael Saylor’s Strategy are well-positioned. However, new treasury firms could struggle to differentiate and sustain premiums. “My instinct is the Bitcoin treasury strategy has a far shorter lifespan than most expect,” Check said in an X post on Friday , cautioning that many recent firms jumping into Bitcoin reserves could struggle to sustain interest or justify premiums. “For many new entrants, it could already be over,” he added. Early Bitcoin Treasuries Thrive as Newcomers Face Uphill Battle Check argued that while early adopters like Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which holds nearly 600,000 BTC, have cemented their lead, new treasury firms face a steeper climb. “Nobody wants the 50th Treasury company,” he noted, warning that investors increasingly expect clear differentiation rather than another firm adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet. “I think we’re already close to the ‘show me’ phase, where it will be increasingly difficult for random company X to sustain a premium and get off the ground without a serious niche,” Check said. My instinct is the Bitcoin treasury strategy has a far shorter lifespan than most expect, and for many new entrants, it could already be over. It's not about a measuring contest. It's about how serious & sustainable your product & Strategy is to sustain the accumulation. — _Checkmate (@_Checkmatey_) July 4, 2025 Despite Bitcoin’s recent rally to within 4% of its all-time high, Check suggested the growing number of Bitcoin treasury firms risks saturating the market. Data from BitcoinTreasuries shows at least 21 new entities added BTC holdings in the past month alone. Check highlighted that speculative retail investors may flock to these newcomers, but stressed they don’t “have infinite money” to support dozens of copycats chasing the same strategy. He noted that larger, well-established firms like Strategy have more time to prove their thesis compared to latecomers. Echoing his concerns, Taproot Wizards co-founder Udi Wizardheimer said many startups entering the Bitcoin treasury space appear to be motivated by short-term profits rather than long-term conviction. “Many of the folks raising just see easy money and have no idea what they’re doing,” Wizardheimer argued. He added that weaker players may eventually be acquired at a discount by stronger firms, though he believes the trend could still see “a few more legs.” Nobody wants the 50th Treasury company. I think we're already close to the 'show me' phase, where it will be increasingly difficult for random company x to sustain a premium and get off the ground without a serious niche. Retail speculators buy startup TCos, and they don't have… — _Checkmate (@_Checkmatey_) July 4, 2025 Doubts Grow Over Long-Term Viability of Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Skepticism around the sustainability of the Bitcoin treasury trend is growing. Breed, a venture capital firm, warned in a June 29 report that only a few Bitcoin treasury companies are likely to survive long term without falling into a “death spiral” as their stock prices converge with the value of their BTC holdings. The warning echoes recent comments from Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, who has voiced concerns over the Bitcoin treasury strategies adopted by some publicly traded firms. Sigel singled out the use of at-the-market (ATM) share issuance programs, arguing that these can become dilutive if a company’s stock price nears its Bitcoin net asset value (NAV). Meanwhile, New York law firm Pomerantz LLP has filed a class action lawsuit against Michael Saylor’s Strategy, accusing the Bitcoin-focused firm of misleading investors about the profitability and risks of its crypto investment strategy.

The coins, acquired initially when BTC traded below $1, were transferred on July 4 in two significant transactions, raising fears of a potential dump amid near-record prices.

Traders feared that such a massive stash entering circulation could spark a correction. In response, long positions were unwound, shorts piled in around the $110,000 resistance level, and price slipped nearly 2% within hours.

Long-Term Outlook Buoyed by Liquidity Forecasts While short-term sentiment faltered, longer-term bulls found encouragement in macro commentary from Sui Group Chief Economist Hong Hao. Speaking to Phoenix Finance, Hong projected that Bitcoin could hit fresh all-time highs by late 2025, driven by strong global liquidity and dovish monetary policies. Hong emphasised that Bitcoin remains highly responsive to changes in liquidity, and with central banks likely to loosen financial conditions into 2025, risk assets like BTC stand to benefit. He also pointed to improving sentiment in U.S. equities, suggesting broader risk-on appetite could return. For now, analysts say this dual narrative—short-term caution vs. long-term optimism—will likely keep BTC consolidating as markets digest the implications of dormant coin activity. #Bitcoin $BTC is consolidating near $108K after rejecting $110,400 resistance.

2025-07-05T13:00:19,"Bitcoin ‘Very, Very Likely’ To Hit $250,000 or Higher, Says Crypto Trader Michaël van de Poppe – Here’s His Timeline","A widely followed crypto analyst says that Bitcoin ( BTC ) is extremely likely to hit $250,000 or possibly even higher. In a new video update, crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 170,000 YouTube subscribers that based on historical precedent, the top crypto asset by market cap appears ready to skyrocket. According to Van de Poppe, BTC is flashing signs of an upcoming rally fueled by exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows. “We are currently consolidating around $100,000 only because we have a new group of participants being into the space due to the ETFs, which if that amount of money is pushing Bitcoin to $100,000, then we are I think underestimating the impact of the actual bull run to be happening and how high Bitcoin can go.” The trader goes on to say that BTC is essentially repeating the same pattern it did during its last few cycles, which this time around would see it rally to a price tag of $250,000, noting that he believes the crypto king would be $50,000 currently if it weren’t for the ETFs. “It’s remarkable and it’s comparable with the previous cycles but just at a different stage and we just need to move upwards with our expectations given that the ETF has been bringing Bitcoin towards higher valuations and I think if we didn’t have the ETF we would have been swimming around $50,000 and then it follows us with the M2 supply chart… which basically tells us that Bitcoin is going to follow that. And if Bitcoin is going to follow through with that, we are about to see Bitcoin move to $160,000- $180,000 in the next three months. And what we also know is that the second half of the year is usually the best period for crypto, if the next quarter after that is going to take place as well, it is very, very likely that Bitcoin is going to reach a number of $250,000 or potentially even higher.” BTC ETFs launched in January 2024 and have a total combined market cap of $138.5 billion at time of writing, according to data from Coinglass. BTC is trading for $107,627 at time of writing, a 1.9% decrease during the last 24 hours.

2025-07-05T12:56:55,"Senator Lummis Introduces New Crypto Tax Bill With a $300 Tax-Free Threshold","Senator Cynthia Lummis has introduced a crypto tax bill that exempts capital gains of $300 or less and has a $5,000 annual exemption cap. The US Senator has introduced the bill to address what she believes is the unfair treatment of crypto traders. Lummis said that her tax bill will allow US citizens to engage with the crypto economy without inadvertently accruing a tax bill. Lummis justifies the viability of her bill by stating that the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimates it will generate $600 million by 2035. This is a significant step for the crypto community, which has faced uncertainty and regulatory hurdles for quite some time now, and would like to embrace financial innovations without having to deal with draconian tax requirements. “This groundbreaking legislation”, said Senator Lummis, “is fully paid-for, cuts through the bureaucratic red tape, and establishes common-sense rules that reflect how digital technologies function in the real world. We cannot allow our archaic tax policies to stifle American innovation, and my legislation ensures Americans can participate in the digital economy without inadvertent tax violations”. The Lummis Crypto Tax Bill would adhere to the current agenda made popular under President Trump, introducing commonsense tax legislation that allows American businesses to thrive in a competitive global market. Lummis has introduced a practical tax-free threshold for digital asset transactions that fall below $300, with an annual limit of $5,000 in transactions. In many countries, cryptocurrencies are not considered currencies, despite clear indications, including their name, as to the true intention of their creator. There remains considerable uncertainty regarding crypto regulation, particularly with respect to tax requirements. Senator Lummis’s bill, therefore, could be a very big breakthrough for crypto traders across the globe. With Lummis’ crypto tax, a person could buy a coffee without having to pay capital gains. It should be a matter of common sense that a person using cryptocurrencies to buy a coffee is not engaging in a serious investment, but is instead treating their cryptocurrency as a currency. The Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that Lummis’s bill would generate $600 million through 2034, a figure that Senator Lummis likes to remind people about. Lummis stresses that the bill reflects how cryptocurrencies are used in the real world. She has described her bill as a commonsense approach. The current government in the US has been focused on cutting red tape and creating regulation that seeks to deregulate the market. Lummis, therefore, is creating timely legislation that may have a good chance of succeeding. The implications for American crypto traders would be immense and would certainly lift a weight of uncertainty from their shoulders. Lummis is concerned that inadvertent tax penalties would discourage Americans from embracing technological innovation. Senator Lummis is a Republican politician from Wyoming. She could very well succeed in passing the bill due to the substantial magnitude of the tax exemption. America could very well become a crypto superpower if the industry is given appropriate tax incentives. Senator Lummis believes this is the case and stresses the need to provide Americans with commonsense tax requirements. Lummis has frequently been an outspoken advocate for Bitcoin and other digital assets. She believes that draconian tax requirements are preventing people from experimenting with cryptocurrencies. Lummis aims to create laws that encourage people to use cryptocurrencies without incurring large tax bills. The tax department should use incentives rather than punishments to support the tech sector. After all, punishments are less effective than incentives.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/senator-lummis-introduces-new-crypto-tax-bill-with-a-300-tax-free-threshold/,"REGULATION|MARKET|BTC","Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Cryptocurrency News",cryptocompare
2025-07-05T12:30:42,"Bitcoin Investor Sentiment Back To ‘Very Bullish’ — What This Means","The Bitcoin price action was largely sideways rather than strongly bullish for most of June. As of early July, the flagship cryptocurrency has maintained its movements around $108,000 – $110,000 region. While Bitcoin still retains its bullish market structure, recent on-chain data calls for a level of caution when investors are looking for opportunities in the market. Bitcoin Sentiment Recovers From Bearish In a July 4 post on the social media platform X, crypto analytics firm Alphractal revealed that the Bitcoin investor sentiment is “very bullish.” This on-chain observation is based on the Alpha Crypto Sentiment Gauge metric. Related Reading: XRP’s 30% Jump To $2.8: Analyst Says This ‘Classic Confirmation’ Must Happen First As its name suggests, the indicator evaluates the emotions of investors in the market, ranging from extreme fear to euphoria. These emotions are represented as color-coded interpretations, usually in red, yellow, light green, and dark green, and these further represent investor sentiment ranging from bearish to very bullish. In the chart shared by Alphractal above, the appearance of a dark green colour signals that the market sentiment is “very bullish” at the moment. Prior to their July 4 post, Alphractal reported in a June 23 post that the market sentiment was flashing bearish signals. In the post on X, the analytics firm warned that the bears could be in trouble. Interestingly, the bears were indeed in trouble, as Bitcoin picked up more buying momentum, consequently liquidating several bearish positions. However, Alphractal explained that sighting green does not necessarily mean the market may be at a top. Instead, it signals that euphoria is taking over the market, which, according to the analytics firm, unlocks a wave of opportunities for Bitcoin buyers. Alphractal said: On the other hand, red zones are usually short-lived, but offer exceptional buy opportunities — like no other indicator can. As the market displayed, the bearish signal interpreted from the Sentiment Gauge eventually provided more buying opportunities. Growing market euphoria is not the only meaning that can be derived from a green signal in the market. It could also serve as a warning for potential overconfidence in the market as Bitcoin continues to gain value. If history is anything to go by, the market could experience rapid price expansions and an increase in investor risk-on approach. On the other hand, the “very bullish” sentiment could also precede sharp corrections, especially if fueled by crowd emotion, rather than market fundamentals. Whether this green sentiment signals the next price leg up, or the establishment of a market top is yet to be known — as a result, traders are advised to remain alert. Bitcoin Price At A Glance After its early show of strength on Thursday, Bitcoin has lost nearly 2% of its value in the past 24 hours. As of this writing, the premier cryptocurrency is valued at about $107,754.

2025-07-05T12:30:29,"Russia goes after illegal miners with new registry for crypto mining rigs","Government departments in Russia have created a special register for coin mining equipment to help local authorities in their efforts to curb illegal mining activities. The initiative of the executive power in Moscow comes amid an ongoing crackdown on miners working outside the law in Russian regions, often powering their crypto farms with stolen electricity. Russia registers mining hardware to track down rogue miners Russia’s Ministry of Energy, the Federal Tax Service (FNS) and the Ministry of Digital Development have compiled a register of devices used for cryptocurrency mining, RIA Novosti reported , quoting Deputy Energy Minister Petr Konyushenko. The gathered information has already been shared with authorities in the Russian regions witnessing increased miner activity, the government official revealed in an interview with the leading news agency, elaborating: “The creation of such a register will allow us to accurately identify consumers using electricity for mining needs. This is necessary in order to apply special regulation and taxation to those.” Konyushenko described the move as a step towards legalizing the whole industry while reducing the illegal consumption of electricity, which has been blamed for losses for the power distribution companies and the state as well as energy deficits in parts of the country. The energy ministry pitched the idea to establish a unified register of mining equipment during a working meeting on the regulation of digital currency extraction in February. The proposal was also backed by the Russian Ministry of Industry in May. Russia legalized cryptocurrency mining with a law adopted in the summer of 2024. It allows both companies and individual entrepreneurs to legally mint digital coins in the Russian Federation, provided they register with the tax authority and pay due taxes. Private citizens are allowed to mine without registration as long as their electricity consumption does not exceed a limit set by the government, which is currently 6,000 kWh a month. However, all miners, including the latter, are obliged to inform the FNS about the amount and the value of the mined cryptocurrency. Moscow cracks down on illegal crypto farms amid mining ban Russia, which has established itself as a major player in the global Bitcoin mining market over the past few years, has been struggling to bring its miners out of the shadows ever since it legalized the industry last year. Less than a third of all Russian mining enterprises have so far registered with the FNS and the new register of mining machines aims to increase the share of legal mining businesses. Other Russian authorities have also joined the hunt for underground miners. In June, the national grid operator Rosseti announced it’s developing a mechanism to pinpoint illegal mining facilities by tracking internet traffic with the help of telecom companies and mobile operators. To limit the negative consequences of the mining boom, which has caused electricity shortages, the Russian government has also imposed seasonal and permanent restrictions on the activity in parts of the vast country. Mining has been completely banned for six years in a dozen regions. This week, President Vladimir Putin justified the measures with the need to balance the exploitation of Russia’s natural resources. At a forum devoted to discussing development initiatives, Putin said that governors have been complaining about growing energy deficits and admitted: “We were forced to make certain decisions in the mining sphere.” Meanwhile, Russian law enforcement and other officials have been cracking down on mining facilities illegally tapped into electricity networks in energy-deficient regions. Last month, the authorities in Krasnoyarsk Krai, a major mining hotspot in Siberia, busted a massive crypto farm occupying almost 30,000 square meters of land, officially registered as a non-residential building on an industrial plot.

2025-07-05T12:30:00,"MUTM keeps climbing as XRP fails: is this the top crypto of July 2025?","Ripple’s XRP had a turbulent run in June, which saw the coin lose momentum. The price hovered around $2 even amid an ambitious announcement by Ripple Labs’ CEO. However, July could be different for the crypto market, and investors are paying attention. The fundamentals in the crypto sector look strong, which could signal that a massive run is in the works. To capitalize on this run, XRP whales are looking for small, promising projects that signal a massive upside. So far, one of the best projects that analysts have identified is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . All signs point to the MUTM token outperforming XPR in the upcoming rally, and investors are capitalizing on this positive forecast. July 2025 has seen a massive rush into the Mutuum Finance presale, and we will dive deep into this trend to help you understand what is going on. The protocol design Mutuum Finance is a DeFi lending protocol that lets users participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. As lenders, they deposit their assets into the pools for the chance to earn interest. Meanwhile, borrowers can deposit their collateral into the pools to access the liquidity in the pools. The stability of the entire ecosystem is protected via over-collateralization. This process ensures that the value of collateral is always higher than the value of borrowed assets. To achieve capital efficiency, interest rates in the pools are based on the pool utilization rate. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale breaks records The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is currently in phase 5, where tokens are going for $0.03. So far, the presale has raised over $11.7 million from around 12,700 unique buyers. At the rate at which tokens in phase 5 are selling out, there may not be any left for you. So far, over half of the tokens set aside for the phase have been sold, barely a month after they went on sale. One of the main drivers of the current phase of the presale is that the price is a 50% discount on the final launch price of $0.06. Most observers of the presale expect the tokens in phase 5 to sell out by the end of July. With 60% of the tokens already sold, this could be a reality soon. As such, now is the time to get your tokens while the massive discount is still available. In the upcoming phase 6, the token price will go up by 16.67%, wiping out this discount. How high could MUTM tokens rise? According to the latest analysts’ projections, the price of MUTM tokens could go up by 4400% when they launch. That means a $1600 investment in the presale today could grow to over $70,000. That is a massive return that no one should miss out on. Best of all, the presale has no upper caps on how much you can invest. Consequently, your return could easily be double or triple the $70k, depending on how much you decide to invest. One of the reasons why analysts are so confident about the future of MUTM tokens is due to the current market conditions. For instance, it is worth noting that while crypto prices are in a consolidation phase, there have not been massive outflows of capital. The price of BTC remains at around $105,000, which is a huge change from past performance. In the past, after a huge rally, like the one in May 2025, the price of BTC would sometimes fall by double digits. However, this time, the price of BTC has basically stagnated. That means there have not been major outflows, thanks in part to the entry of institutional investors in the sector. The current conditions mean that the next rally will be bigger than anything experienced before in the crypto market. It could be the final rally before the crypto market finally stabilizes and matures. As such, this MUTM token presale represents the last opportunity to make truly massive returns in the crypto sector. Mutuum Finance partners with CertiK To ensure the long-term protection of its users, Mutuum Finance recently announced a partnership with CertiK. The two will partner on a $50,000 USDT bug bounty program. The program will be split into four tiers, which are critical, major, minor, and low. This will ensure that those security experts who identify the biggest issues will receive the biggest rewards. MUTM is the crypto to watch in July 2025 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents an exciting opportunity for massive gains. So far, 60% of the tokens set aside for phase 5 have been sold, less than a month after they launched. With a 50% discount available to phase 5 buyers, this is the time to act. In the next phase, the token price will go up by double digits, greatly diminishing the discount you will get.

While most retail investors remain cautious as the bitcoin price continues to consolidate around $108k. In the meantime, Bitcoin’s “mega whales” are quietly adding to their stacks. This quiet accumulation might be a strong signal of what’s coming next for Bitcoin’s price. Mega Whales Keep Accumulating Recent data shows more Bitcoin wallets now hold over $10 million worth of Bitcoin. This number has grown by 4.23%, which means big investors and rich companies still trust Bitcoin. These big players are not buying because of hype, they are buying quietly now, hoping for a bigger price jump later. Smaller wallets are doing the same. Wallets with $100,000 to $1 million in Bitcoin have gone up by 2.71%, and wallets with $1 million to $10 million have increased by 2.34%. This steady buying shows that many people still believe Bitcoin will grow more in the future, especially if new ETFs bring in more money and governments stay supportive. Price Still Range-Bound, But Whales Stay Calm Right now, Bitcoin has been stuck trying to break above the key resistance between $107,000 and $110,000 . So far, it’s mostly been bouncing around this area without a strong breakout. Even though excitement among smaller traders hasn’t fully returned, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at a healthy 55, showing there’s still room for upward momentum without the market being overbought. What’s different this time is the patience. These big players aren’t chasing short-term gains. Their buying looks slow and deliberate, suggesting they expect something bigger in the long run. Bitcoin Eyeing New ATH: $120k History shows that whale accumulation often happens before major rallies. If Bitcoin can break above the $110,000 resistance with strong volume and hold its ground, the next target could be the psychological $120,000 mark.

2025-07-05T12:07:29,"Bitcoin to Benefit Immensely from Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill: White House Advisor","US Presidential advisor Bo Hines has tweeted that the crypto economy, especially Bitcoin , is set to benefit immensely from Trump’s recently signed “Big, Beautiful Bill” . The US House of Representatives passed the bill symbolically on the 4th of July, following an earlier nod by the Senate. Initially, there was significant opposition to the bill, including some staunch resistance within the President’s Republican party; however, it may be precisely what crypto users need in times of regulatory uncertainty. What is Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill? The main focus of the major legislation is on three of Trump’s key policy positions: tax cuts for companies, reduced regulations, and enhanced border control. While these three issues received major mention in the bill, some crypto-friendly Acts managed to pass through as part of the package, with strong bipartisan support. This level of cross-aisle support demonstrates just how popular cryptocurrency is among the American public. They include the Genius Act and the Clarity Act, both of which address the regulatory climate of the USA. The Genius Act sets clear rules regarding the circulation of stablecoins in the country while being open to innovative ideas coming from the sector, Hines stated . The Clarity Act, on the other hand, aims to address the major legal conundrum faced by cryptocurrencies, not just in the USA but worldwide. According to the White House advisor, this legislation draws a clear line between a digital commodity and a digital security, paving the way for crypto innovation without legal complications in the USA. Hines further states that the “Big, Beautiful Bill” will make the country a global leader in crypto innovation and adoption. He gave the President high praise and noted that it was a significant milestone for the country. Will Trump’s Bill Kickstart a New Crypto Revolution in the USA? Pro-crypto legislation and crypto-friendly policies were a major part of Donald Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign. It was in complete contrast to his opponent Kamala Harris, who failed to capitalize on the pro-crypto entirely. The Clarity Act and the Genius Act are likely to significantly support the cause of digital currencies in the country if implemented in full spirit. Trump is likely to claim that a significant portion of his promise to implement crypto reforms has been fulfilled. However, hawkish federal agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the FBI will need to be on board for this crypto regulation to succeed. The latter has historically treated digital currencies like a tool used by criminals, so that a complete rewiring may be on the cards in the coming days, especially under Trump’s FBI chairman, Kash Patel.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-to-benefit-immensely-from-trumps-big-beautiful-bill-white-house-advisor/,"REGULATION|BTC|EXCHANGE","Bitcoin|Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Donald Trump|Ethereum News",cryptocompare

2025-07-05T12:02:42,"Canadian woman drags service provider to court over 12 BTC SIM swap scam","A Canadian woman has sued a phone company over the theft of her Bitcoin worth $531,000 in 2021, in a SIM swap scam. The victim, a pharmacy manager, alleges that the lost Bitcoin, now worth roughly $1.8 million, was stolen after a cellphone store employee gave her personal information to a hacker. The victim, Raelene Vandenbosch sued Rogers Communications and Match Transact Inc. in three provinces, alleging that the loss she suffered from the SIM swap scam was the fault of an employee of a phone kiosk owned by Match. Now, the Supreme Court in British Columbia (B.C.) has ruled that the issue be resolved in private arbitration, outside a courtroom. Canadian woman loses BTC in SIM swap scam According to a court filing submitted by the Canadian, she approached Rogers about the situation when she first discovered it. The Canadian woman said she was offered a refund on one month’s service, worth about $95. Vandenbosch then filed lawsuits in Ontario, Quebec, and B.C. to recoup more. Vandenbosch said the funds were stolen after a hacker pretending to be a technician from Rogers convinced a Match-owned mobile store employee in Montreal to share their computer screen. The Canadian native said the action allowed the hacker to gain access to her account information, even though she was in B.C. at the time. The hacker then proceeded to download all her account information onto a SIM card that was in their possession. After the deed, the hacker then allegedly hijacked her account, locking her out and stealing her Bitcoin in the process. Vandenbosch is suing for negligence, breach of privacy, and breach of contract. The Canadian is also seeking restoration of the amount that the Bitcoin was at the time of the theft and other damages and admission of guilt. In response, Rogers and Match have filed a response in court, with none of them admitting or denying the allegations. Instead, they have argued that they could resolve the issue through arbitration rather than in a courtroom. Vandenbosch also signed an arbitration agreement with Rogers as part of her cellphone plan. In a ruling by the B.C. Supreme Court Justice Anita Chan, the case is expected to go to arbitration, except for the part seeking a public admission of wrongdoing, which the judge has ruled can proceed because it is in the public interest. The judge did not rule on the facts of the case in her decision. The result could mean that if Vandenbosch continues to pursue the suit and either company is forced to admit fault, then she does not get paid back for the lost BTC. A spokesperson representing Rogers has defended the company and its security record. The spokesperson also highlighted the risk associated with digital assets. “As fraudsters use constantly evolving techniques to try and take advantage of consumers across the wireless industry, we continually strengthen our security measures to protect our customers against fraudulent activity,” the spokesperson said. Vandenbosch contends arbitration ruling In her initial filing, the Canadian said that the hacker allegedly gained access to her crypto accounts on Ledger and Shake Pay, stealing over 12 BTC, worth around $534,000 at the time. The stolen Bitcoin is now worth over $1.8 million as of today’s price. She is accusing Match of negligence and breach of privacy for failing to protect her personal information. She also claims Rogers failed to protect her privacy by allowing kiosk workers access to too much personal information and failing to mandate verification questions. Meanwhile, the Canadian native has argued that she should not be required to go through arbitration because of the amendments made by the B.C. government to the Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act in March. The government amended the legislation to bar cell phone companies from imposing these agreements on customers, arguing that forced arbitration hurts users. Vandenbosch said that these new laws should be retroactively applied to her case, but Justice Chan disagreed, saying the rules are not meant to be retroactive. “The prohibition came into force on Royal Assent of Bill 4 on March 31, 2025, and applies to new disputes that are launched after the date of Royal Assent,” a spokesperson from the B.C. Ministry of Attorney General said. “This means if a supplier had a pre-existing contract with an arbitration clause, the parties are no longer bound to arbitrate if they were not already in arbitration at the time.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

2025-07-05T12:00:00,"Bitmine Immersion: $250 Million PIPE Redefines The Balance Sheet, But Valuation Looks Stretched Already","Summary BitMine Immersion has secured a pivotal $250 million PIPE to initiate an Ethereum corporate treasury strategy, fundamentally redefining its capital structure. The capital fuels a strategic shift towards a large Ethereum treasury and business expansion into higher-margin Bitcoin Treasury Advisory and Mining-as-a-Service offerings. BMNR trades at a 52.82x price-to-hold ratio (current BTC only) and a pro forma 3.29x (including planned ETH treasury), representing a notable premium compared to peers like MSTR, MARA, and RIOT. While the capital infusion is a significant positive, a hold rating is initiated due to the current rich valuation. Bitmine Immersion Technologies ( BMNR ) is the latest company to adopt the crypto corporate treasury strategy. As publicly traded companies increasingly adopt the crypto-backed balance sheet approach, it is becoming increasingly important for investors to develop a framework for evaluating companies pursuing such strategies. In the last month, I've covered a series of companies that recently adopted a crypto-backed corporate balance sheet. And part of the approach I've taken to analyze these companies includes an assessment of the underlying business (if any), the strategic intent for adopting a crypto treasury strategy, and the potential near and long-term implications for the company's capital structure. My recent coverage of SharpLink Gaming ( SBET ), a digital sports media and performance marketing firm, that adopted an Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) corporate strategy with a $463 million ETH buy last month, showed significant supply overhang from equity fund raises and potential for heavy dilution. Another company I covered recently was Next Technology ( NXTT ), a Chinese tech firm that touts AI and blockchain service offerings in addition to its recent pivot to a Bitcoin corporate treasury strategy. An in-depth analysis revealed that no tangible backstop business exists yet for the company, nor were there any working products in its acclaimed tech verticals, nor revenue, nor backlog yet. This underscores the critical importance of due diligence when investing in crypto treasury companies. This article initiates coverage on Bitmine Immersion, examining its core Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining business and its pivot to Bitcoin and Ethereum treasury strategy, and the broader implications of this pivot. The main goal is to give investors a grounded view of what's driving this stock, how sustainable the thesis is, and whether there is long-term value beyond the current hype created by the crypto treasury pivot. Bitmine Immersion Technologies - Company Profile Bitmine calls itself a ""Bitcoin network company that drives value through BTC treasury and multiple Bitcoin income streams."" As its primary business, Bitmine mines Bitcoin just like any other Bitcoin miner. The company currently operates two mining sites in Texas and two mining sites in Trinidad and Tobago. One of Bitmine's main differentiators in the mining business is its use of immersion-cooled infrastructure, which involves submerging ASIC miners in thermally conductive liquid instead of relying on the more common air cooling. Immersive cooling isn't novel or proprietary to Bitmine, but Bitmine is one of the miners that has fully adopted this cooling method as the only operational standard. I covered the benefits of immersive cooling last year in an article for MARA Holdings ( MARA ), where I talked extensively about MARA's two-phase immersion cooling system. Just a side note, If you are interested in understanding what it entails and the implications for mining operations and long-term OpEX reduction, you can refer to that piece on Mara Holdings , which explains it in detail. Bitmine calls part of its model ""synthetic mining,"" which is to acquire Bitcoin hashrate not by buying hardware but via leasing or contract-based access to mining power, essentially paying for the right to use the hashrate without owning the underlying machines. It is like an institutional-grade version of cloud mining. In cloud mining, smaller retail miners typically prepay for a fixed slice of hashrate from a provider, while in this case, it is large-scale miners that lease the equipment or the output through structured agreements. Synthetic mining is also different from colocation or traditional hosting arrangements, in that, in synthetic mining, as Bitmine defines it, hashrate exposure is secured via futures or revenue-sharing contracts, and they do not own or operate the physical ASICs themselves. An instance of this is the 12-month forward contract with Luxor, a hashrate derivatives provider, which allowed Bitmine to pre-sell future hashrate in exchange for upfront capital to finance new ASICs. BMNR was uplisted to NYSE last month, following a 1 for 20 reverse stock split in May, and a public offering of 2,250,000 shares of its common stock at $8.00 per share. BMNR is up over 3,000% since announcing the initiation of an Ethereum treasury strategy last month. How A PIPE Capital Infusion Changes The Math For Bitmine Bitmine has had a crescendo of catalysts in the space of a month that has set off a rally for the stock: NYSE uplisting in early June, followed by the announcement of the purchase of 100 BTC for the Bitcoin treasury strategy. The 100 BTC was purchased with the $18 million raised from the public offering mentioned earlier, and an additional 54.167 BTC were purchased on June 17, bringing the company's total BTC in treasury to 154.167 BTC. Then, the most recent crown jewel of $250 million PIPE to initiate an Ethereum treasury strategy . These are well-timed announcements, if you ask me. Bitmine has also launched a Bitcoin Treasury Advisory Practice , an expansion into potential higher-margin service offerings. As part of this push, the company signed a $4 million deal with a U.S.-listed firm to lease 3,000 ASIC miners through 2025 and provide $800k worth of consulting services focused on Bitcoin Mining-as-a-Service (MaaS) and corporate treasury strategy. According to management, this single deal surpasses Bitmine's total FY24 revenue which was $3.3 million, suggesting that advisory services could become a meaningful growth driver for the company. In the recently released financials of Bitmine's latest 10-Q , which is for fiscal Q3 2025, there are several interesting line items in the analysis of the capital structure of Bitmine. I'll also show how the announced $250 million PIPE raise is the most significant and transformative event in the history of the company by integrating the impact into the balance sheet of the company. Income statement (10-Q) On the income statement for FQ3, we can see the emergence of consulting revenue of $35k. Though it is still a small figure compared to total revenue, its emergence on the income statement is still evidence of Bitmine's new Bitcoin treasury advisory business line. Another consideration is that the majority of the consulting revenue from the $4 million deal is still unrecognized, hence the large increase in Customer Advances line on the balance sheet. Balance sheet (10-Q) One noteworthy line on the balance sheet is the over 100% increase in customer advances, jumping from $703k to $1.8 million YoY, clearly showing upfront payments for services yet to be rendered, a direct reflection of the new revenue streams. Beyond this, the balance sheet also shows a substantial increase in cash and cash equivalents, rising from $499k to $1.4 million. Cryptocurrencies held also increased from just $78k about a year ago to $1.2 million as of FQ3 end in May. Current assets increased from $1.56 million to $2.18 million, and that number is likely to jump significantly when the $250 million PIPE closes and most of the proceeds go to the planned Ethereum treasury holdings. And considering that the fund is from a PIPE equity raise, there will likely not be a matching increase in current liabilities. That would put Bitmine's balance sheet on a relatively similar attractive footing with peers that have also adopted a BTC and ETH treasury strategy like Bit Digital ( BTBT ). But for now, and based on the FQ3 results, Bitmine's balance sheet lacks significant underlying financial strength in short-term liquidity. To make the situation worse, loans payable to related parties and the interest accrued on these related party loans are about $2.4 million in total. This alone exceeds the $2.18 million total current assets of the company, which is an alarming concern. Bitmine appears to be a highly leveraged business. Total shareholders' equity in the FQ3 balance was $2.9 million. This makes up about 35% of the $8.3 million in total assets, while the remaining ~65% ($5.4 million of total assets) are funded by liabilities. Bitmine's debt-to-equity ratio ($5.4 million / $2.9 million) is currently 1.87. For every dollar of owner's capital, Bitmine has roughly $1.87 in debt. This high leverage is on the verge of being rectified. $250 million from the PIPE means equity will increase by roughly that amount, which will cause the debt-to-equity ratio to plummet and deleverage the company's balance sheet. Shareholders' equity breakdown (10-Q) Bitmine's FQ3 balance sheet shows a significant Accumulated Deficit of $13.9 million, which is the cumulative net losses the company has incurred over its history, and this directly erodes the total Stockholders' Equity because it is recorded as a negative component of equity. While the company has managed to raise substantial capital in the past, evidenced by the $16.8 million in Additional Paid-in Capital [APIC], this capital has largely been offset by the company's historical net losses, leaving a net shareholders' equity of only $2.9 million. The shareholders' equity would have been larger if not for the accumulated deficit. Here's where the PIPE funds play another vital role in Bitmine's capital structure, as it will certainly swell the APIC and in turn swell total equity. Almost every dollar will go into the APIC line as the $4.50 price from the PIPE is significantly above the nominal par value of BMNR ($0.0001 per share). If we infuse the ~$250 million into the APIC, it will surge to over $266.8 million (from the current $16.8 million), leading to a massive increase in total equity. With Bitmine's total shareholders' equity of $2.9 million, a net loss of, say, $2 million in a quarter, would wipe out a significant portion (over 60%) of its equity. But with the ~$250 million injection into the equity, the total equity becomes ~$252.9 million; and under this new equity base, if the company still loses $2 million in a quarter, that loss would represent only a tiny fraction (less than 1%) of its new equity base. This significantly increases the company's financial resilience and provides a substantial buffer against future operational losses. Like I said earlier in this piece, the $250 million from the PIPE is the crown jewel and game-changer for Bitmine. The current capital structure of the company, characterized by high leverage and a small equity base largely eroded by accumulated deficit, but the PIPE fundamentally transforms this by infusing massive equity, drastically reducing reliance on debt, and enabling all of the company's strategic pivot. By the time FQ4 results are released and the new capital structure is reflected, I believe Bitmine will have a more attractive balance sheet and greater financial flexibility, like several of its peers. BMNR is up a lot lately and for good reason; the market has reacted to the $250 million PIPE and the ETH treasury strategy. My main goal in this piece has been to help readers understand the nuances beyond just the fresh injection of funds for ETH purchase for treasury purposes. The ETH pivot is what the market has largely reacted to. But beyond that pivot, I've shown the dramatic transformation of the company's capital structure and the journey toward enhanced liquidity and financial resilience. BMNR price trend (Seeking Alpha) Bitmine currently holds ~154 BTC, which has a carrying value of $16.6 million at the current $107,700 per BTC spot price as of July 4, 2025. Then, assuming it buys ETH with the total $250 million from the PIPE, that would give a total crypto assets holdings value of around $266.6 million (if we add the ETH purchase to the BTC holding). At BMNR current market cap of $877 million, BMNR's pro forma price-to-hold ratio (stock price against the per-share value of their crypto holdings) would be 3.29x. If we consider only the current BTC and do not include projected figures for the ETH treasury, we'd have a 52.82x ($877 million / $16.6 million) p/hold multiple for BMNR. This is in very expensive territory and not on the side of undervaluation to net asset value when compared to crypto treasury peers with stronger visibility and more robust core operating businesses, like Strategy ( MSTR ), Riot Platforms ( RIOT ), or MARA. This reinforces that BMNR is expensive at the current price level. Top 5 Bitcoin treasury holdings ( bitcointreasuries.net) MSTR currently trades at a p/hold multiple of 1.76x, MARA trades at 1.16x, and RIOT trades at 2.10x (you can get each of these p/hold numbers by dividing the market by the dollar value of the Bitcoin holdings for the respective companies). Bitmine's current p/hold is way more expensive and even the pro forma p/hold of 3.29x still suggests a notable premium relative to its digital asset holdings, especially if we consider the fact that all the aforementioned companies in the p/hold comp in this analysis all have way more robust core businesses and substantial revenue compared to Bitmine's. I am therefore initiating coverage on BMNR with a Hold rating. As an investor, I'll be closely monitoring how the company deploys the fresh capital, grows its treasury assets, and executes on its core Bitcoin mining operations. These all will be key indicators of whether Bitmine can transition from speculative upside to sustainable value creation, and whether its current valuation can eventually justify a long-term investment thesis.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4799368-bitmine-immersion-250-million-pipe-balance-sheet-valuation-looks-stretched?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|REGULATION|BUSINESS|MINING|ETH","SBET|ETH-USD|NXTT|BTC-USD|BTBT|MSTR|RIOT|BMNR",cryptocompare

2025-07-05T11:58:41,"Singapore Slams Banks, Crypto as $3B Money Laundering Scandal Ends","The post Singapore Slams Banks, Crypto as $3B Money Laundering Scandal Ends appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In one of the biggest financial enforcement moves in its history, Singapore has fined nine major financial institutions a total of S$27.5 million (US$21.5 million) for failures in anti-money laundering (AML) controls. This comes in the final chapter of a S$3 billion money laundering scandal that rocked the city-state in 2023. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) confirmed the penalties on Thursday, naming global banks like Credit Suisse, UBS, Citibank, UOB, Julius Baer, LGT Bank, and asset manager Blue Ocean among those penalized. Yes, this is serious. Read on for the details! The Assets That Sparked the Crackdown This massive case first surfaced in August 2023, when police raided multiple properties and arrested ten Chinese nationals, later linked to organized criminal groups. Authorities uncovered billions in illegal funds tied to luxury real estate, cash, and cryptocurrencies . The individuals were later sentenced to prison terms between 13 and 17 months, deported after serving time, and permanently banned from returning to Singapore. Credit Suisse Fined the Most Among the banks involved, Credit Suisse’s Singapore branch received the largest fine of S$5.8 million. MAS cited “poor or inconsistent implementation of AML controls” as the reason. Others, like UBS, Citi, and UOB, were also fined for similar lapses. UOB, Singapore’s third-largest bank, said it has already taken corrective steps to strengthen compliance. MAS has also issued prohibition orders lasting up to six years against four individuals linked to the case. This is Singapore’s most serious regulatory action since 2016, when the MAS shut down BSI Bank over its role in the 1MDB scandal. [post_titles_links postid=”478986″] Crypto Is Being Closely Watched While the focus is on traditional banks, crypto had a role to play. Some of the seized assets were in cryptocurrencies, pulling the digital asset sector into the spotlight once again. And it’s happening at a time when Singapore is tightening crypto regulations . Under new rules that kicked in this June: Crypto firms offering overseas services must be licensed under the FSMA by June 30, 2025 Retail investors are banned from using credit or receiving incentives Transactions over SGD 1,500 require full ID checks under the Travel Rule DeFi frontends and wallets that serve retail users or earn from token-based services may now fall under MAS oversight Crypto innovation is welcome, but not without strong compliance. A Warning Shot to Banks and Crypto Firms Singapore is raising the bar on financial integrity. And as crypto becomes more embedded in the global financial system, these rules aren’t just for banks anymore. The MAS is trying to build a system where trust is the most important. It will be interesting to see the results of this crackdown.

The scandal originated in August 2023 when police raided properties and arrested ten Chinese nationals linked to organized crime. Authorities uncovered over S$3 billion in illegal funds tied to luxury real estate, cash, and cryptocurrencies, which had been laundered through Singapore’s financial system. Is Singapore considered a crypto-friendly country? Yes, Singapore is widely considered one of the most crypto-friendly countries in 2025. It boasts a thriving blockchain ecosystem, clear regulatory guidelines from MAS (Monetary Authority of Singapore), and a supportive stance towards crypto innovation, aiming to balance growth with robust consumer protection and AML measures. How much is cryptocurrency taxed in Singapore for individual investors? For individual investors, Singapore has a 0% capital gains tax on cryptocurrency. This means you generally won’t pay taxes when selling or trading crypto as a personal investment. However, if you’re frequently trading as a business or earning crypto for goods/services, it may be subject to income tax.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/singapore-slams-banks-crypto-as-3b-money-laundering-scandal-ends/,"ASIA|FIAT|BUSINESS|ALTCOIN|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING","News",cryptocompare

After a sharp decline and waning investor confidence, whales are now accumulating billions in SHIB, reigniting short-term price and market optimism. Despite Shiba Inu’s prolonged consolidation, a sudden spike in on-chain activity has caught the market by surprise. For instance, Shiba Inu’s transaction volume soared to 24 trillion SHIB in early June, with whale activity surging 600%. This striking on-chain spike may be the reason why bullish momentum is starting to build, given that SHIB has already enjoyed a 4.3% increase over the past 24 hours, trading at $0.00001182. SHIB’s Golden Cross Pops Up According to market analyst Kryll, Shiba Inu is witnessing a golden cross amid intensified whale accumulation. Why is this bullish? Well, a golden cross happens when the 50-day moving average (MA) crosses above the 200-day one, signalling a potential trend reversal from bearish to bullish. Therefore, Shiba Inu’s short-term price momentum is gaining strength, which has the potential to boost sentiment through positive market psychology. Technical analyst Tom Tucker added , “SHIB is trading just above its YTD low, with a double-bottom pattern forming. Exchange supply is dropping, futures open interest is rising, and a BTC rally could add fuel.” Source: Tom Tucker Meanwhile, the Shibarium team recently unveiled a major upgrade aimed at boosting decentralization, privacy, and censorship resistance. Soon, rate limits will be enforced on public Remote Procedure Call (RPC) endpoints, marking a key move toward a more secure and resilient Shiba Inu network.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-sees-whale-frenzy-with-10-4-trillion-shib-scooped-up-as-golden-cross-forms/,"SHIB|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|BTC","Cryptocurrency|News|SHIB|SHIBA INU",cryptocompare

The ETF is only behind the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF and the iShares MSCI EAFE ETF. The IBIT Bitcoin ETF holds $76 billion in assets under management (AUM) and generates an estimated $191 million in annual revenue. IBIT Becomes BlackRock’s Third Most Profitable Fund BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF has quickly established itself as the firm’s third-highest revenue-generating fund. The ETF has $76 billion in assets under management (AUM), and a 0.25% expense ratio, generating $191 million in annual revenue. The ETF’s stunning growth puts it behind only BlackRock’s iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF and the iShares MSCI EAFE ETF. IBIT launched in January, easily crossing early projections thanks to strong demand from institutional and retail investors. The ETF has experienced consistent inflows since then, which have significantly contributed to its annual revenue. Most analysts believe IBIT will surpass its competition in revenue generation. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas stated, “IBIT is now the 3rd highest revenue-generating ETF for BlackRock out of 1,197 funds, and is only $9b away from being #1. Just another insane stat for a 1.5-year-old (literally an infant) ETF.” Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor responded to the milestone, stating that IBIT will soon become BlackRock’s number one revenue-generating ETF. Market watchers also noted that the spot Bitcoin ETF is only $9 billion in assets away from surpassing IWF as BlackRock’s top revenue-generating ETF. A Record-Breaking ETF BlackRock manages over 1,100 ETFs. However, IBIT’s stunning growth has been unlike any other. The ETF’s current revenue is only $20 million lower than IWF and $16 million lower than EFA. Current market conditions and investor sentiment could help IBIT climb higher. BlackRock’s IBIT became the fastest ETF to reach $2 billion in inflows, reaching the milestone just days after its launch. The fund crossed $50 billion within six months, placing it among the fastest-growing ETFs of all time. IBIT has consistently registered inflows from corporate treasuries, hedge funds, and advisors, benefiting from the rising demand for Bitcoin and other digital asset investment products. According to BlackRock, IBIT’s growth signals rising institutional adoption of Bitcoin. IBIT’s trajectory mirrors the early success of gold ETFs and suggests a push towards crypto integration in traditional portfolios. IBIT’s success is largely due to the fact that it gives investors exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of wallets and direct ownership of the asset. It also underscores the growing demand for Bitcoin as a mainstream investment asset. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

SEC filings reveal Pershing Square Capital has allocated 41% of its capital into the small handful of bets, with the largest allocation in Uber. The firm now has about $2.8 billion invested, or 18.5% of its portfolio, in the rideshare giant, holding 30.3 million shares. Uber’s strength lies in its dominant driving platform, fueled by network effects that attract more drivers and riders, alongside its growing profitability and robust cash flow generation. In addition, Pershing now holds an estimated 18,984,772 shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill, representing 9.07% of its portfolio, valued at just over $1 billion. Chipotle’s scalable, health-focused fast-casual model leverages strong brand loyalty and operational efficiency to drive consistent growth, although the company has faced challenges like tariff-related cost pressures and weaker 2025 foot traffic. Lastly, Pershing Square Capital has committed 14% of its portfolio, approximately $1.6 billion, to Google’s parent company Alphabet. The firm holds an estimated 9,048,131 shares at $180.55 each. The big bet is focused on the tech giant’s continued dominance, fueled by cloud computing, artificial intelligence, ad services and YouTube, bolstered by high switching costs and data-driven network effects, although the firm continues to fight ongoing antitrust challenges.

A court document has resurfaced online in which Ripple CTO David Schwartz claims that Satoshi held “enormous amounts of XRP.” This remark was in response to the question, “You also say, ‘we control a lot of XRP’, does that make it different from Bitcoin ?” To this, Schwartz replied that back then, it was hard to know how Bitcoin was distributed. So Satoshi, the creator, probably held a lot of XRP at that time. David Schwartz said Satoshi holds $XRP … LINK TO COURT CASE PDF BELOW https://t.co/NgaHK0tbyE pic.twitter.com/0UH4Sc1QPK — (@XrpHodL_) July 4, 2025 His unexpected answer has sparked renewed speculation, especially with a mention of the year 2017, which added more confusion and curiosity among crypto enthusiasts. X user Tiffany Hayden joked about it, asking, “How many XRP did Satoshi hold? Did you really say this and nobody noticed?” Schwartz responded with a simple, “What was the question?” prompting a wave of amusement and intrigue within the community. However, Satoshi has vanished from the crypto scene between 2010 and 2011, with no signs of wallet activity or XRP involvement since. Also, Schwartz’s claim that Satoshi “probably” held XRP lacks evidence and appears to be a speculation. David Schwartz has often speculated to be behind the mysterious identity of Bitcoin’s creator. However, he has clarified that he only got involved in Bitcoin around 2011. The Bitcoin whitepaper came out in 2008, and the network officially launched in 2009, but no one knows who truly created it. XRP: Satoshi’s Real Vision? Previously, a widely circulated post by John Squire claimed that XRP is the product which comes closes to Satoshi Nakamoto’s main idea. XRP fans argue that it solves many of Bitcoin’s current issues, like high fees, slow speeds, and centralization.

He quoted Satoshi’s famous last message from April 23, 2011 “I’ve moved on to other things” hinting that XRP, which launched just a year later, could have been part of those “other things.” Could Satoshi Have Helped Create XRP? While there’s no proof, Ripple CTO David Schwartz and others involved in XRP were also early Bitcoin contributors which has sparked more curiosity around the theory. Also, 2009 emails show that Satoshi had praised the original Ripple project, calling it “unique” for spreading trust rather than centralizing it. However, his remarks referred to RipplePay, created in 2004 and not XRP. But many have mistakenly linked his praise to XRP. Some analysts have also pointed to the timing of Satoshi’s exit in 2011 and the start of XRP’s development soon after.

A major shift in old BTC wallets has the crypto world talking, and once again, Davinci Jeremie has a message! The well-known early adopter, who famously bought Bitcoin at $1, has shared a reminder: “Stacking sats in times of disbelief makes you legend later.” The post came just a day after 80,000 Bitcoin, worth over $8 billion , was moved from wallets that hadn’t been touched since 2011. 80,000 BTC on the Move Yes, you read that right. The transactions were spotted on Friday and quickly sparked debate. Each wallet had been inactive for over a decade before suddenly transferring large sums of Bitcoin. Coinbase’s Conor Grogan suggested these wallets may have been part of a compromised OG stash. Others speculated they could be linked to early figures like Ripple co-founder Arthur Britto or longtime Bitcoin supporter Roger Ver. I think the timing is very interesting. With Ripple applying for bank license, Fedwire, SEC case closing in, etc. There must be something happening. Even folks are thinking could be Britto.

Davinci’s Message: Why It Matters Now Jeremie’s tweet is a reminder of what has worked in crypto – buying when others hesitate.

2025-07-05T11:20:14,"Stablecoin Mania: Why China’s Douyin is Abuzz with Digital Currency Talk","BitcoinWorld Stablecoin Mania: Why China’s Douyin is Abuzz with Digital Currency Talk Imagine a short video about a complex financial instrument topping the trending charts on one of the world’s largest social media platforms. That’s exactly what’s happening in China, where a video titled ‘What is a stablecoin ‘ has exploded on Douyin, the local version of TikTok, garnering over 12 million views. This isn’t just a fleeting moment; it signals a profound curiosity among the general public about the evolving world of digital assets. But why are millions suddenly captivated by the concept of a stablecoin , especially in a region known for its strict stance on cryptocurrencies? What Exactly is a Stablecoin and Why the Buzz on Douyin? At its core, a stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, usually pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar, or sometimes to commodities like gold. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, which can see dramatic price swings, stablecoins aim to offer price stability. This makes them attractive for various purposes, from facilitating transactions to acting as a safe haven during market downturns. The sudden surge in interest on Douyin can be attributed to several factors: Accessibility: Short-form video platforms like Douyin excel at breaking down complex topics into digestible, engaging content. A ‘What is a stablecoin’ video can explain the basics in under a minute, making it accessible to a mass audience who might otherwise find crypto daunting. Curiosity: Despite official restrictions, there’s an inherent curiosity about new financial technologies. People are always looking for ways to understand emerging trends that could impact their lives or the economy. Economic Context: In uncertain economic times, the concept of a ‘stable’ digital asset might naturally pique interest, even if the direct application for the average user isn’t immediately clear. Decoding China’s Crypto Curiosity Amidst Regulations The fact that ‘What is a stablecoin ‘ is trending in China is particularly fascinating given the country’s stringent regulations concerning cryptocurrencies. China has famously cracked down on crypto trading and mining, even launching its own central bank digital currency, the Digital Yuan (e-CNY), as a state-controlled alternative. So, what does this public interest in a private digital asset signify for China crypto ? It’s important to distinguish between outright speculation and genuine educational interest. While direct engagement with private cryptocurrencies for investment might be restricted, the underlying technology and concepts behind them continue to fascinate. The trending video likely serves an educational purpose, demystifying a term that many have heard but few truly understand. This curiosity doesn’t necessarily translate into a desire to defy regulations but rather reflects a global trend of digital literacy. The government’s push for the Digital Yuan also implicitly raises public awareness about digital currency in general. As people become more familiar with the concept of a digital form of money, their natural curiosity extends to other forms of digital assets, including stablecoins. Global Cryptocurrency Trends: Is China Leading the Way in Public Education? The Douyin phenomenon isn’t an isolated incident; it’s a reflection of broader cryptocurrency trends worldwide. Across the globe, we’re seeing an increasing demand for clear, simple explanations of crypto concepts. Social media platforms, from TikTok to YouTube, have become unlikely educators, filling a gap that traditional financial institutions often struggle to address. This massive viewership in China suggests a significant underlying demand for crypto knowledge, even in markets with tight controls. It highlights that: Information travels: Despite firewalls, interest in global financial innovations persists. Education is key: The public is eager to learn, and simplified content resonates widely. Social media’s power: These platforms are incredibly effective at disseminating information, regardless of the topic’s complexity or sensitivity. Understanding these cryptocurrency trends is vital for anyone operating in the digital asset space, as it points to where future growth and adoption might stem from: informed users. The Future of Digital Currency: Beyond the Headlines The trending stablecoin video on Douyin serves as a powerful indicator of the public’s growing engagement with the concept of digital currency . While China’s specific regulatory environment adds a unique layer to this story, the underlying message is universal: the world is increasingly curious about how digital assets will shape our financial future. Looking ahead, we can anticipate continued discussions and developments around stablecoins and other forms of digital money. The benefits, such as efficient cross-border payments and a hedge against volatility, are compelling. However, challenges like regulatory oversight, potential for centralization, and consumer protection remain critical areas of focus. For the average person, understanding these basic building blocks of the digital economy will become increasingly important, regardless of where they live.
