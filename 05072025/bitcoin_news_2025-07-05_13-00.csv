President Donald Trump has issued a stern warning: if U.S. trading partners don’t finalize new trade agreements by July 9, they could face tariffs of up to 70% on imports starting August 1 . This bold move under Trump’s “America First” policy has already started rattling global markets—and could soon ripple into the crypto space. July 9 Deadline: No Extensions, Says Trump Trump made it clear—no country will get an extra day beyond the July 9 deadline to strike new trade deals. Currently, a temporary 10% tariff is in place for most partners, but failure to strike a deal could raise that figure to as high as 70%. Who Has Secured a Deal So Far? Some countries have already managed to avoid the tariff hike: UK : Reached a deal in May to maintain a 10% tariff with special terms for autos and aircraft engines. Vietnam : Agreed to a 20% export tariff to the U.S., with U.S. goods entering Vietnam duty-free. But others are still negotiating, or worse—on the verge of missing the deadline. Countries at Risk: Japan, South Korea, EU, India Japan and South Korea saw talks break down after initial progress. The EU is internally divided, delaying its potential deal. India is resisting U.S. demands, especially regarding genetically modified crops and agri-market access. With less than a week left, the clock is ticking fast. U.S. Sending Warning Letters to Non-Compliant Countries The U.S. government is reportedly sending official letters to at least 12 nations, detailing the exact tariff rates they will face if no agreement is reached. Countries like South Korea, Indonesia, and the EU are racing to finalize deals before July 9. [post_titles_links postid=”478938″] Stock Markets React to Trade Uncertainty Markets are already showing signs of pressure: European Market: -1.02% yesterday Japanese Market: -1.91% this week Indian Market: -0.59% this week Analysts warn that fears of a global trade war are pushing investors toward safer assets. What It Means for Crypto: Volatility First, Bullish Later? If new tariffs spark global economic uncertainty, risk assets like crypto may initially dip. But in the medium to long term, crypto could benefit: Bitcoin and stablecoins may become hedges against inflation. Investors might shift to crypto as fiat currencies come under pressure. Market instability often leads to increased crypto adoption . While Trump’s tariff threat may jolt markets in the short term, it could fuel crypto’s growth as a decentralized alternative to traditional finance.

2025-07-05T10:50:05,"El Salvador’s Bold Bitcoin Accumulation: A Strategic Boost to National BTC Holdings","BitcoinWorld El Salvador’s Bold Bitcoin Accumulation: A Strategic Boost to National BTC Holdings In a world where nations are still grappling with the concept of digital assets, El Salvador continues to stand out as a pioneering force. The Central American nation, under the visionary leadership of President Nayib Bukele, has once again made headlines with its latest Bitcoin accumulation , solidifying its commitment to a unique economic path. This recent acquisition isn’t just a number; it’s a testament to a bold crypto strategy that is reshaping the global perception of sovereign digital asset reserves and positioning El Salvador Bitcoin initiatives at the forefront of financial innovation. El Salvador Bitcoin: A Steadfast Commitment to Digital Assets The news broke from the National Bitcoin Office (ONBTC): El Salvador has added another eight Bitcoin (BTC) to its coffers over the past week. This seemingly small increment pushes the nation’s total BTC holdings to an impressive 6,228.18 BTC, now valued at approximately $674 million. This consistent, strategic accumulation underscores El Salvador’s long-term belief in Bitcoin as a foundational element of its financial future. What does this steady growth signify for a nation that adopted Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021? The implications are significant, pointing towards a deep-seated conviction in the long-term value and utility of digital currency. Consistent Growth: Unlike speculative trading, El Salvador’s approach appears to be one of steady accumulation, often buying the dip, which demonstrates a disciplined investment philosophy. Transparency: The ONBTC regularly updates the public on the nation’s holdings, fostering trust and providing a clear picture of its digital treasury, a move often praised by crypto advocates. Strategic Vision: Each acquisition reinforces the government’s conviction that Bitcoin offers a path to economic independence and financial inclusion, aiming to bypass traditional financial hurdles. This ongoing commitment to El Salvador Bitcoin initiatives highlights a unique economic experiment unfolding before our eyes. It’s not merely about holding a digital asset; it’s about integrating it into the very fabric of the national economy, from tourism to remittances, creating a new economic paradigm. Understanding El Salvador’s Bitcoin Accumulation Strategy How does a nation go about accumulating such significant BTC holdings ? El Salvador’s strategy has been multifaceted since it became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. Beyond direct purchases, the nation has utilized various revenue streams related to its Bitcoin initiatives. For instance, profits from its state-run Bitcoin wallet, Chivo, and even Bitcoin generated from its volcanic geothermal energy projects, contribute to the national treasury’s digital reserves. This diversified approach to Bitcoin accumulation showcases a thoughtful, if unconventional, economic model designed to maximize their digital assets. President Bukele himself has often taken to social media to announce significant purchases, often coinciding with market dips, demonstrating a ‘buy the dip’ philosophy. This active management of their Bitcoin accumulation strategy has allowed El Salvador to grow its reserves steadily, turning market volatility into opportunities for growth. It’s a high-stakes game, certainly, but one that El Salvador seems committed to playing for the long haul, aiming to leverage Bitcoin’s potential for national prosperity. The National Bitcoin Office: Guardians of El Salvador’s Crypto Future The role of the National Bitcoin Office (ONBTC) cannot be overstated in El Salvador’s crypto journey. Established to manage, monitor, and promote the country’s Bitcoin initiatives, the ONBTC acts as the central hub for all things related to the nation’s digital asset strategy. Their recent announcement of the updated BTC holdings is just one example of their commitment to transparency and public communication. The ONBTC’s responsibilities are extensive and crucial for the successful implementation of the national crypto strategy : Overseeing the national Bitcoin treasury and ensuring secure storage of the nation’s digital wealth. Promoting Bitcoin education and adoption among citizens, bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralized currencies. Developing policies and regulations for the responsible use of Bitcoin, creating a stable legal framework for its integration. Collaborating with international entities on digital asset matters, fostering global understanding and cooperation. This dedicated institution ensures that El Salvador’s bold crypto strategy is executed with diligence and accountability, providing a structured approach to integrating Bitcoin into the national economy and setting a precedent for other nations to potentially follow. What Do El Salvador’s BTC Holdings Mean for Its Economy? With its BTC holdings now valued at nearly $674 million, the question naturally arises: what does this mean for El Salvador’s economy? While a significant sum, it’s important to view this within the context of the nation’s overall economic landscape. However, the symbolic and potential long-term benefits are substantial. Bitcoin, as legal tender, aims to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar, attract foreign investment, boost tourism, and provide financial services to the unbanked population. The nation’s continued Bitcoin accumulation strategy reinforces these goals, painting a picture of a future less dependent on traditional financial systems. The vision is that as Bitcoin’s value potentially increases over time, so too will El Salvador’s national wealth, which could then be reinvested into public services and infrastructure. This innovative crypto strategy is a gamble, certainly, but one with the potential for transformative rewards. It’s a bet on the future of decentralized finance and a testament to the nation’s desire for financial sovereignty, aiming to unlock new avenues for economic growth and development. Challenges and the Future of El Salvador’s Crypto Strategy While the headlines often focus on the accumulation, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges inherent in El Salvador’s pioneering crypto strategy . Volatility in the Bitcoin market means the value of their BTC holdings can fluctuate significantly, posing risks to the national balance sheet. International financial institutions like the IMF have expressed concerns, citing risks to financial stability and consumer protection. Despite these warnings, El Salvador has remained steadfast, indicating a firm belief in their chosen path. Looking ahead, the future of El Salvador Bitcoin initiatives involves continued infrastructure development, such as the proposed “Bitcoin City” powered by geothermal energy, and further integration of Bitcoin into daily life through enhanced accessibility and education. The success of this grand experiment will likely serve as a blueprint, or a cautionary tale, for other nations contemplating similar moves. The world watches closely as El Salvador continues to navigate the uncharted waters of sovereign Bitcoin adoption and its ambitious Bitcoin accumulation , potentially setting a new standard for national economic policy. Conclusion: A Nation Forging Its Own Path El Salvador’s consistent Bitcoin accumulation , culminating in its impressive BTC holdings of over 6,228 BTC, is more than just a financial update; it’s a narrative of national determination and innovation. Underpinned by the diligent work of the National Bitcoin Office and a clear crypto strategy , the nation is carving out a unique position on the global stage. While challenges remain, El Salvador’s unwavering commitment to El Salvador Bitcoin as legal tender and a national asset offers invaluable insights into the potential future of sovereign digital economies. It’s a bold move that continues to spark debate, inspire curiosity, and ultimately, shape the future of finance.

2025-07-05T10:40:03,"Fragbite Group’s Bold Leap: $522K Loan Fuels Bitcoin Treasury Revolution","BitcoinWorld Fragbite Group’s Bold Leap: $522K Loan Fuels Bitcoin Treasury Revolution In a compelling move that underscores the evolving landscape of corporate finance, Swedish esports powerhouse Fragbite Group has made headlines by securing a substantial loan to establish a dedicated Bitcoin treasury unit. This isn’t just about a company getting a loan; it’s a powerful statement about growing confidence in digital assets and a strategic shift towards leveraging Bitcoin for long-term financial stability and growth. Fragbite Group’s Strategic Dive into Bitcoin The news, reported by MarketScreener, reveals that Fragbite Group has obtained a SEK 5 million, interest-free loan, equivalent to approximately $522,854. This significant capital injection is specifically earmarked to support the rollout of its ambitious new Bitcoin (BTC) Treasury division. What makes this even more intriguing is the source of the loan: a group of shareholders, including three key company insiders – Treasury Director Patrik von Bahr and board members Mikael A. Pettersson and Niclas Bergkvist. The terms of the loan allow for its conversion into shares at a rate of SEK 10 (about $1) per share, pending approval by a supermajority at an extraordinary general meeting. This structure indicates a deep-seated belief from within the company’s leadership in the potential of this strategic direction. CEO Stefan Tengvall articulated the firm’s vision, stating that the swift completion of this deal reflects strong investor confidence in Fragbite Group’s commitment to utilize BTC. The goal is clear: to strengthen the company’s capital structure and drive long-term shareholder value. This decision positions Fragbite Group not just as an esports entity, but as a forward-thinking player in the realm of corporate finance, embracing innovative strategies for wealth preservation and growth. Understanding the “Why”: The Allure of a Bitcoin Treasury So, why are companies like Fragbite Group increasingly turning to a Bitcoin treasury ? For decades, corporate treasuries primarily focused on managing cash, short-term investments, and liquidity, aiming for safety and modest returns. However, the current economic climate, characterized by inflation concerns and low interest rates, has prompted a re-evaluation of traditional strategies. A Bitcoin treasury involves holding a portion of a company’s reserves in Bitcoin, treating it as a strategic asset rather than just a speculative investment. Key reasons for this shift include: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins makes it a potential hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies due to inflation. Store of Value: Proponents view Bitcoin as “digital gold,” a scarce asset that can preserve purchasing power over time. Balance Sheet Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a treasury diversifies a company’s asset holdings, reducing reliance on traditional assets that may be susceptible to specific economic pressures. Potential for Appreciation: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has shown significant long-term growth potential, offering an opportunity for substantial returns on capital. Innovation and Forward-Thinking Image: Embracing Bitcoin can signal a company’s commitment to innovation and understanding of emerging financial technologies, appealing to a tech-savvy investor base. For Fragbite Group, a company operating in the cutting-edge esports sector, adopting Bitcoin aligns perfectly with its innovative identity and audience demographics. The Growing Wave of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Fragbite Group is certainly not the first to venture into the realm of corporate Bitcoin adoption . Over the past few years, a growing number of public and private companies have allocated portions of their balance sheets to Bitcoin, setting a precedent for others to follow. The most prominent example is MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, which has accumulated billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin, making it a pioneer in this space. Other notable companies include: Tesla: The electric vehicle giant briefly held a significant amount of Bitcoin on its balance sheet and accepted it for payments, though its stance has evolved. Block (formerly Square): Jack Dorsey’s payments company has also made substantial Bitcoin purchases, viewing it as a tool for economic empowerment. Marathon Digital Holdings: A leading Bitcoin mining company, which naturally holds a significant amount of BTC. These early adopters have demonstrated varying levels of success and commitment, but their actions have collectively legitimized Bitcoin as a viable treasury asset for mainstream corporations. Fragbite Group’s move adds another layer to this narrative, particularly from a sector like esports, which often sits at the intersection of technology and entertainment. Esports Meets Digital Assets: A Natural Synergy? The intersection of esports Bitcoin adoption makes perfect sense. The esports industry is inherently digital, global, and technologically forward-thinking. Its audience is largely composed of digital natives who are often early adopters of new technologies, including cryptocurrencies and blockchain. This demographic familiarity with digital assets can translate into several advantages for an esports company like Fragbite Group: Audience Alignment: Holding Bitcoin resonates with a tech-savvy and crypto-aware audience, potentially enhancing brand loyalty and appeal. Future Integration: A deeper understanding and direct involvement with Bitcoin could pave the way for future integrations within the esports ecosystem, such as blockchain-based gaming, NFTs for fan engagement, or even crypto-based prize pools and payments. Global Reach: Esports is a global phenomenon, and Bitcoin, as a borderless currency, aligns well with the industry’s international nature, potentially simplifying cross-border transactions and operations in the future. By establishing a Bitcoin treasury, Fragbite Group is not just making a financial decision; it’s also making a strategic brand statement that aligns with the future trajectory of the digital entertainment industry. Navigating the Challenges of Digital Assets While the benefits are compelling, integrating digital assets like Bitcoin into a corporate treasury is not without its challenges. Companies must carefully consider and mitigate various risks: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can be highly volatile, leading to significant fluctuations in the value of a company’s holdings. This requires a long-term investment horizon and a high tolerance for risk. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Changes in regulations could impact the legality, taxation, or operational aspects of holding digital assets. Custody and Security: Storing Bitcoin securely requires specialized knowledge and robust cybersecurity measures to prevent hacks or loss of funds. Companies must choose reliable custody solutions. Accounting and Taxation: The accounting treatment of Bitcoin can be complex, varying by jurisdiction. Companies need clear guidance on how to report these assets on their balance sheets and handle tax implications. Fragbite Group’s decision to use an interest-free, convertible loan from insiders suggests a well-thought-out approach to managing initial capital and risk, demonstrating confidence from those closest to the company’s operations and vision. Fragbite’s Bold Move: A Blueprint for Others? Fragbite Group’s innovative financing structure for its Bitcoin treasury unit is particularly noteworthy. An interest-free loan from shareholders, convertible into shares, aligns the interests of the capital providers directly with the long-term success of the Bitcoin treasury initiative and the company as a whole. This mechanism minimizes immediate financial strain while providing a clear pathway for investors to participate in the company’s growth, should the Bitcoin strategy prove successful. CEO Stefan Tengvall’s emphasis on investor confidence and the swift completion of the deal highlights the internal belief in this strategic direction. This move could serve as a blueprint for other companies, especially those in the tech and gaming sectors, looking to explore similar avenues for balance sheet diversification and value creation without incurring immediate debt service costs or diluting existing equity unnecessarily. The successful execution and future performance of Fragbite Group’s Bitcoin treasury unit will undoubtedly be watched closely by other corporate entities contemplating their own foray into digital asset management. Actionable Insights for Investors and Businesses For investors, Fragbite Group’s move signals a company willing to innovate and embrace new financial paradigms. When evaluating companies, consider: Strategic Rationale: Does the company have a clear, well-articulated reason for holding Bitcoin? Risk Management: How are they addressing volatility, security, and regulatory risks? Transparency: Is there clear reporting on their digital asset holdings and strategy? Leadership Vision: Is the leadership committed to and knowledgeable about digital assets? For businesses considering a similar path: Start Small: Begin with a manageable allocation to test the waters and gain experience. Educate Your Team: Ensure your finance, legal, and IT teams understand the nuances of digital assets. Seek Expert Advice: Consult with legal, tax, and custody experts specializing in cryptocurrencies. Long-Term View: Adopt a long-term investment horizon to ride out market volatility. The Future of Corporate Finance: Is Bitcoin the New Gold? Fragbite Group’s venture into a Bitcoin treasury unit is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a testament to the evolving role of cryptocurrencies in mainstream corporate finance. As inflation concerns persist and the digital economy expands, more companies are likely to explore alternative assets like Bitcoin to protect and grow their capital. While challenges remain, the trend towards corporate Bitcoin adoption is gaining momentum, pushing the boundaries of traditional treasury management. Fragbite Group, an esports innovator, is now also a pioneer in this financial frontier, demonstrating that strategic foresight in the digital age extends beyond product development to encompass a company’s very financial foundation. Fragbite Group’s decision to establish a Bitcoin treasury unit marks a significant milestone, showcasing a forward-thinking approach to corporate finance within the dynamic esports industry. By leveraging an innovative loan structure and demonstrating strong internal confidence, the company aims to bolster its capital structure and enhance shareholder value. This move not only highlights the increasing legitimization of Bitcoin as a corporate asset but also signals a potential blueprint for other businesses seeking to diversify their balance sheets and embrace the future of digital finance. As the lines between traditional finance and the crypto world continue to blur, Fragbite Group stands out as an early adopter charting a new course for corporate treasury management in the digital age.

However, along with support, the discussion has sparked some debate as well. While some US crypto experts are drawing a blueprint for crypto development, others are sharing contrasting views. Debate on Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in the US Lyn Alden, a well-known crypto advocate and financial analyst, stood against nationalizing companies to build a strategic Bitcoin reserve. She stated that this could result in breaching the property rights in the country. She said in a statement on X , “Nationalizing a company like that is a good way for a country to tell the world that they don’t respect property rights and to think twice about investing in the country for the next couple of decades.” While Alden opposed the approach, citing concerns for investors’ funds, other crypto experts shared different perspectives. Crypto Advocates in Favor of Nationalizing Companies for Bitcoin Reserve Willy Woo , who is renowned for his unique insights on crypto, created a playbook for the US bitcoin reserve detailing all the required efforts and approaches. His idea was acknowledged by Max Keiser , an American filmmaker and bitcoin advocate, who said, “Willy’s view is worth considering.” Keiser also indicated that if Russia and China implement this proposal, they could acquire 1 million bitcoin, which will potentially lead to a hash war. He also stated that such a move will push the US to seize private firms like MicroStrategy, Riot Blockchain for national security. [post_titles_links postid=”478878″] Does the US Hold the Potential for Nationalizing Companies for a Bitcoin Reserve? In 2025, the US implemented a series of laws and regulations to evolve cryptocurrency and digital assets in the country as it aspires to become the global ‘crypto capital.’ With new blockchain developments, innovative crypto regulations, and President Trump’s support, it is possible for the US to nationalize companies for a bitcoin strategic reserve in the near future. Final Thought After March 6, when Trump signed an executive order to establish a bitcoin reserve , it became a global trend. While the approach of nationalizing companies for cryptocurrency has gained massive support from US representatives, many investors are fearing to invest in those companies.

Nationalizing companies for a Bitcoin reserve could have mixed effects. Proponents argue it could strengthen the US balance sheet, help pay down national debt, hedge against inflation, and boost the legitimacy of crypto. However, critics like Lyn Alden warn it could violate property rights, deter foreign investment, increase taxpayer risk if Bitcoin’s value crashes, and potentially lead to government manipulation of the crypto market, contradicting Bitcoin’s decentralized ethos. How does the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve compare to similar efforts in other countries? The U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, established by Executive Order on March 6, 2025, primarily involves holding forfeited Bitcoin as a long-term reserve and not selling it. This differs from countries like El Salvador, which adopted Bitcoin as legal tender and actively purchased it, or Bhutan, which accumulated reserves through state-owned mining. Other nations like China, the UK, and Ukraine also hold significant Bitcoin, largely from seizures. Many countries (e.g., Brazil, Russia, Japan) are proposing or exploring similar reserves, while others like Switzerland and the EU remain hesitant or focus on CBDCs.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-reserve-plan-sparks-nationalization-debate-in-u-s-congress/,"BTC|FIAT|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ALTCOIN|ASIA|MARKET","News|Bitcoin Reserve",cryptocompare

With RSI at 48.76 and price trading below the 20-day SMA at $148.56, SOL shows consolidation signs. The Bollinger Bands indicate a potential range, with the lower bound at $132, suggesting a potential low of $130.

Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High July $130 $150 $165 Solana Price Prediction 2025 As per CoinGlass , Solana leads the crypto derivatives market with a massive $6.14 billion in open interest, far outpacing all other tokens. This indicates strong trader confidence and sustained capital inflow into SOL positions. Other notable projects like FARTCOIN, LINK, and UNI trail behind with open interest between $460M–$540M. The dominance of SOL on both the treemap and bar chart suggests it remains a favorite among leveraged traders, potentially fueling heightened volatility and price action in the near term.

Predictions suggest XRP could reach $5.05 by the end of 2025. Long-term projections show XRP could hit $26.50 by 2030 and $526 by 2050. XRP, one of the top five crypto assets known for its role in cross-border payments, is drawing increased attention as institutional adoption grows and its long-standing legal battle nears a conclusion. Since President Trump took office, Ripple XRP has gained significant traction, fueled by rising on-chain activity, bullish market sentiment, and increasing speculation around a potential XRP ETF Approval in 2025. With these developments in play, XRP price prediction is becoming a major focus for investors. Can XRP reach $100? Is a $500 target realistic in the long term? This article dives deep into XRP price prediction for 2025 and beyond through 2030.

In Q2, after testing the upper boundary of a multi-month descending wedge at $2.65 in mid-May, it fell to hold above a key swing low support at $2.10. The upside potential has been limited due to worsening geopolitical conditions. Many anticipated a catalyst on June 16th with a favorable lawsuit update, but it resulted in a 60-day pause in appeals. On June 17th, the SEC delayed Franklin Templeton’s XRP spot ETF amid geopolitical tensions. The U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites during the third weekend of June shook market sentiment completely XRP dipping to $1.94, but a ceasefire in the fourth week helped the market rebound. On June 23rd onwards, XRP climbed from $1.94, rising over 15% after the ceasefire announcement, turning it into a short-term battle. The fourth week was full of bullish developments, as Ripple’s CEO announced on June 28th that they would drop the cross-appeal against the SEC . Experts now expect, if the SEC also drops its appeal, it would formally conclude a four-year conflict. Investor sentiment has improved, showing less panic in short-term among traders. A strong “buy-the-dip” mentality has emerged amid the chaos. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, called Ripple’s recent decision a turning point, increasing the odds for XRP ETF approval, with BlackRock potentially entering soon . The sentiment has changed, and with market-wide optimism in early July, as the short-term EMA is breached and the XRP price is inching closer to retest the falling channel’s upper border aligned with a supply block near the key $2.40 resistance. This time, a break of the upper border could trigger a rally toward $2.80 in the short term, with a chance to retest the all-time high of $3.40 later in July. The first week of July’s momentum is backed by growing whale transaction count (>100K USD), rising exchange outflow, and spiked spot volume. It indicates a sustained short-term rally. In case, if no strong catalyst emerges to push beyond the pattern’s upper border and the $2.40 supply block, a flash crash could occur, pushing XRP’s price down. If selling pressure were to resume the $2.10 support, which aligns with the 200-day EMA is crucial, as losing grip at this mark could decline to $1.88 or even $1.63. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High June 2025 $1.7 $2.45 $3.40 XRP Price Prediction 2025 If XRP successfully breaks its all-time high of $3.40 in May 2025—a major supply zone on the chart—it could realistically target $5 by year-end, fueled by growing optimism from banks , institutions, and potential ETF support. Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD , is now integrated into its cross-border payments system, Ripple Payments, further strengthening its position in global finance. Moreover, XRP has partnered with Wormhole to utilize its phenomenal cross-chain interoperability. Through this road in development, they seek a real-world adoption to boost. Therefore, consistent developments and crucial partnerships, If XRP manages to break above its all-time high of $3.40 in July 2025, after clearing the high-volume resistance zone at $2.40. Then odds are high that it could realistically target $5 by year-end. This potential rally would likely be fueled by growing optimism from banks, institutional investors, and the possibility of ETF approval. Adding to the bullish case, Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, is now integrated into its Ripple Payments system too, further solidifying its role in global finance. Notably, institutional dominance is evident, with the top 100 addresses holding 70% of the circulating supply, positioning XRP as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap at $138 billion.

The RSI hovers at 47.18, reflecting growing momentum, while the price remains below the 20-day SMA and mid-Bollinger Band. If bulls regain control, Ethereum could reach a high of $2,800 in July 2025.

Long-term forecasts estimate BTC prices could hit $900K by 2030. The Bitcoin price prediction for 2025 is turning increasingly bullish. This surge in optimism is driven by record-breaking inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs , rising institutional interest , and strong political support, including Trump’s plan to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . With companies like GameStop and Trump Media adding BTC to their balance sheets, and the Fed signaling potential rate cuts, investors are asking one critical question: Will Bitcoin go back up and lead the next financial revolution? What is the Bitcoin price prediction for today? The BTC price may range between $107,296.38 and $109,142.23 today.

Hence, we expect the BTC price to create a 2025 high of ~$168,000. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $71,827.81 $119,713.02 $167,598.22 Bitcoin Price Prediction July 2025 Bitcoin’s performance in Q1 2025 was notably lackluster due to tariff-related concerns alongside the rise in tension between Russia and Ukraine. Yet, it made a remarkable comeback in Q2, particularly during April and May. Driven by easing tensions, Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high of $112,000 by the third week of May. But, In early June, BTC attempted to hold support near the previous swing low from May after pulling back from its $112K peak. On June 6th, a positive U.S. jobs report and renewed U.S.-China trade talks sparked a brief bounce from the dynamic support of the 50-day EMA. Yet, by June 10th, the momentum began to wane, with increased selling pressure linked to rising geopolitical tensions, particularly between Israel and Iran. The situation escalated on June 17th when President Donald Trump issued a warning to Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei. Following a defiant response from Iran, the U.S. launched attacks on Iranian nuclear sites over the third weekend of June, further worsening the geopolitical landscape. Consequently, Bitcoin briefly dipped to around $98,000 but rebounded after a ceasefire announcement on June 23rd. As of the fourth week of June, Bitcoin’s price has advanced significantly, yet it struggles near a multi-month supply block. The price action throughout June had resembled a continuation pattern known as “flag pattern”, with the upper border aligning with this supply block. In the first week of July, daily active addresses, whale transactions count (>1m USD), and addresses holding coins (10,000 – 100,000) have seen increases, as a result, the border of the flag is breached on the upside. Now, if Bitcoin can break through June’s swing high of $110K then this time the chances of surpassing $112,000 become more likely. A successful breakout could propel BTC towards a new high of $120,000 by the end of July. Conversely, if bearish pressure mounts and the price reverses, then the consolidation under the flag would continue and could return to the critical May swing low support zone. Should this level also fail, then Bitcoin could fall to the flag’s lower border, dragging the price down to the $100,000 to $95,000 range in the near term. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High June 2025 $95,000 $103,500 – $108,000 $120,000 Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 Recent insights from Santiment highlight that the Israel-Palestine conflict in H2 2024 caused a spike in social volume. Initially, crypto prices dropped, but the market rebounded, leaving panic sellers behind. A similar trend occurred in Q2 2025 when rising Ukraine-Russia tensions led to increased social activity. After a price dip, Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high of $112,000. Now, the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict has prompted U.S. intervention, resulting in another surge in social volume. Bitcoin’s price dipped to $98,000, but analysts expect a strong rally in H2 2025. Despite geopolitical challenges in Q1 and Q2, the overall outlook for Bitcoin remains bullish. Source: santiment Looking ahead, advancements in financial products, especially ETF flows, could sustain Bitcoin’s bullish momentum. Market sentiment is optimistic, suggesting Bitcoin may reach new highs. Moreover, the speculation is growing that the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates in the U.S., further supporting Bitcoin’s upward movement. Also, pata data is evident of its relationship with global liquidity, as global M2 increases, Bitcoin often experiences price surges. Similarly, the CryptoQuant data also indicates rising accumulation, with exchange reserves declining to 2.4 million BTC, down from 3.1 million BTC a year ago. Ultimately, Bitcoin’s future market potential will depend on buying demand, geopolitical developments, regulatory changes, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Talking about Bitcoin Price Prediction, if things turn bullish, BTC is expected to create a high of $175K. If things go south, we can expect a low of $70K.

2025-07-05T10:00:15,"Analyst Warns Bitcoin Treasury Trend May Lose Steam","The strategy of holding Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset may not be as sustainable as many expect, warns Glassnode lead analyst James Check. In a post on X on Friday, Check shared concerns that the easy gains for companies entering the Bitcoin treasury space might already be in the past. “My instinct is the Bitcoin treasury strategy has a far shorter lifespan than most expect,” Check wrote, adding that the approach is not about “a measuring contest” but about whether a company’s product and business model can support long-term Bitcoin accumulation without depending solely on hype. “Nobody Wants the 50th Treasury Company” Check noted that new Bitcoin treasury firms face challenges as investors increasingly favor established players. “Nobody wants the 50th Treasury company,” he said, emphasizing that it will become harder for new firms to sustain a premium in the market unless they bring a unique offering. In the 30 days leading up to Friday, 21 entities added Bitcoin as a reserve asset, according to BitcoinTreasuries data . Yet the gap between leaders and newcomers remains significant. Michael Saylor’s Strategy (MSTR), the largest public Bitcoin treasury, holds 597,325 BTC, while the second-largest, MARA Holdings, holds around 50,000 BTC — roughly one-twelfth as much. Check observed that retail speculators are often drawn to these newer treasury firms, but he cautioned that they do not “have infinite money.” While he remains bullish on Bitcoin’s price, which was trading at $107,990 at publication, he noted that sustaining a treasury strategy is a different challenge than simply betting on price appreciation. “It’s a spectrum,” Check explained, saying that larger players like Strategy have more runway than the 300th company attempting to adopt a Bitcoin treasury model. Consolidation May Follow for Weaker Players The concerns echo comments from Taproot Wizards co-founder Udi Wizardheimer, who argued that some companies enter the Bitcoin treasury space seeking quick profits without fully grasping the long-term implications. “Many of the folks raising just see easy money and have no idea what they’re doing,” Wizardheimer said, adding that weaker players may eventually be acquired by stronger firms as the trend matures. Venture firm Breed also raised concerns, suggesting only a few Bitcoin treasury companies will survive the potential “death spiral” affecting firms that trade close to their net asset value. Similarly, GoMining Institutional’s Fakhul Miah recently warned about “copycat” companies entering the space without safeguards, which could risk damaging Bitcoin’s broader image if these firms fail.

Price prediction suggests potential to reach $2.05 by year-end 2025. Long-term forecasts indicate ADA could hit $10.25 by 2030. The Plomin Hard Fork, which activated in Q1 2025, has significantly enhanced Cardano’s appeal to investors by establishing full decentralized governance. This is seen as a key milestone that aligns with the blockchain’s long-term vision of community-driven decision-making. Despite these advancements, bullish attraction post-Plomin Hard Fork was tempered by market dynamics and challenges, on its price chart. However, in Q2 2025, things seem to have changed , as a variety of optimistic factors surround the altcoin sector, which is benefiting the ADA price. As a result, Cardano price prediction is heating up again in the community. With bullish technical signals, major upgrades, and ETF hopes rising , many are intrigued to know, “Is ADA Price ready for a massive breakout?” Here’s a detailed ADA price prediction for 2025 and beyond, including expert targets up to 2050. Coinpedia’s Cardano Price Prediction 2025 Assuming that Cardano continues to focus on the network’s upcoming updates, we can expect a wider adoption rate. Even the ETF odds has higher approval rate that could bring large crowd wil multi-billion dollars into the asset, once approved. Therefore, we expect the ADA price to reach $2.05 in 2025.

As a result, ADA price has been showing signs of short-term recovery from the $0.55 support level. With the recent bullish momentum in the crypto sector during the first week of July, ADA price has been uplifted to $0.61 with growing hopes of an ADA ETF. ADA is now inching towards the range’s upper border, and a sustained bullish momentum could lead to higher levels. The key level to watch in July is $0.72. If ADA holds and reclaims this level, a breakout above that range may lead to a rally toward $0.86, and if this resistance is cleared, ADA could aim for $1.10 by July end. However, failure to stay above $0.60 could send ADA back to $0.55, with a deeper decline possible toward $0.40. Price Prediction Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) July 2025 $0.40 $0.74 $1.10 ADA Price Prediction 2025 Source: coincarp Cardano has always prioritized decentralization, and the recent Plomin hard fork has taken it a step further. Unlike many other blockchains, Cardano gives more control to its users than to any central organization. This is reflected in CoinCarp’s rich list, where the top 100 addresses hold just 22% of the mainnet’s circulating supply, significantly lower than most other altcoins. To break above the $1.10–$1.20 range, strong retail participation will be key. A major catalyst could be the approval of an ADA ETF, expected by year-end, which could attract billions in inflows. If ADA holds above its Q1 2025 high, it has a strong chance of retesting the $2.05 mark before the year ends.

2025-07-05T09:40:00,"Bitcoin price prediction 2025-2031: Will BTC hit $150k soon?","Key takeaways: Bitcoin price faces volatility around $108K. Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction.

BTCUSD Chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $107,130, beginning a bearish trend to $104,960. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin down today? Bitcoin faced a surge in bearish pressure as buyers failed to defend support channels. This pushed the BTC price toward $108K. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $100K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Bitcoin ETF volume is on a rising trend, recording $102.14 million in daily total net inflows on June 30, marking day 15 of a gigantic inflow streak that now totals $4.73 billion. It also marks the third consecutive month of total net inflows totaling $12.8 billion since April. Bitcoin price prediction July 2025 Bitcoin’s price jumped to $109,000, making Q2 its best quarter since 2020. In the second quarter of 2025 alone, it went up by 31%, showing strong market activity and growing investor trust. This rise is partly because, in the past, Bitcoin has often grown a lot after its “halving” events. Analysts think the current market is following the same pattern, which could mean we’ll see a peak around September 2025. Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $105,000 and be pushed further, at least $113,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $101,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction July 2025 $101,000 $105,000 $113,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100. Bitcoin price prediction 2028 By 2028, Bitcoin’s price is expected to reach a low of $164,063. Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year. Bitcoin price forecast 2029 Projections for 2029 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629. The price may peak at as much as $255,321, with an average throughout the year expected to be around $200,312. Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction 2030 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $225,903 and potentially rise to a maximum of $270,593.

Cathie Wood of Ark Invest forecasts Bitcoin may hit $600,000 by 2030, with a potential rise to $1.5 million in her bull case scenario after Bitcoin ETF approval (Bitcoin exchange traded funds). Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of the Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K. By the end of June, BTC price reclaimed the $108K level.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-price-prediction/,"REGULATION|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|UNI|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT","Crypto Price Predictions|BTC",cryptocompare
2025-07-05T09:31:10,"Trump's 'Big Beautiful Bill' Could Boost Bitcoin Appeal","President Donald Trump celebrated the passage of his “big, beautiful bill” with a patriotic display at the White House, marking a major legislative win. But while the event focused on military strength and national pride, the bill’s deeper economic changes could have unexpected effects on the crypto world. One key result is growing concern about inflation , as the bill includes large tax cuts and expanded spending. Economists warn this could increase the federal deficit by over $3 trillion, potentially weakening the U.S. dollar. Historically, such conditions often lead investors to seek out alternative assets like Bitcoin , which is seen as a hedge against inflation. At the same time, the bill excludes proposed crypto tax reforms . Lawmakers had pushed for provisions like tax breaks for small Bitcoin transactions and mining operations, but those were left out of the final version. This means that while crypto may gain more attention due to the economic fallout, the regulatory landscape remains the same for now. Despite no direct impact on digital assets, experts believe the broader financial consequences of this bill could drive more people to consider Bitcoin as a safe store of value. As inflation fears rise, crypto might gain new momentum, even without fresh legal support.",coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/trump-bill,"BTC|REGULATION|BUSINESS|MINING","",cryptocompare
2025-07-05T09:31:06,"Crypto Traders on Alert as Sweden Expands Law to Seize Digital Assets","Sweden’s Justice Minister Gunnar Strömmer has ordered local authorities to intensify efforts to seize assets like cryptocurrency, luxury goods, and real estate under a sweeping new law targeting unexplained wealth, even from individuals not directly implicated in crimes. Key Takeaways: Sweden’s new law lets authorities seize assets, including crypto, from anyone unable to prove the legitimacy of their wealth. Over $8.3 million has already been confiscated since November 2024. Concerns are rising among legal experts over potential civil liberties violations. Speaking to Dagens industri on Thursday , Strömmer urged police, tax authorities, and the Swedish Enforcement Authority to prioritize cases likely to result in significant confiscations. The justice minister revealed that more than $8.3 million in assets have been seized since the law took effect in November 2024. “Now it’s time to turn up the pressure even more,” Strömmer said. Sweden’s New Law Lets Authorities Seize Assets Without Proof of Crime The controversial legislation empowers authorities to seize cash, bank assets, and luxury items from individuals unable to prove that their wealth matches their income or offer a legitimate explanation for its origin. Sweden’s government announced when passing the measure that it aimed to crack down on violent crime by disrupting criminal finances. “This means that a person who, for example, has large amounts of cash, sizeable bank assets, or luxury articles may forfeit them if he or she does not have an income that is proportional to the property and cannot otherwise explain where it comes from,” the government stated at the time. Though it’s unclear how much of the $8.3 million seized so far is linked to cryptocurrency, the law has already sparked concerns among legal experts and civil liberties advocates. The Economist reported in December that a woman traveling through Gothenburg-Landvetter Airport had $137,000 and a Rolex watch confiscated, while roughly $1 million in assets were seized during the first week of enforcement. California passed bill to seize your crypto. pic.twitter.com/QxbWzKEsSZ — mrredpillz jokaqarmy (@JOKAQARMY1) June 28, 2025 In April, Swedish MP Rickard Nordin called on the finance minister to consider adopting Bitcoin as a reserve asset, proposing that authorities retain seized BTC rather than liquidate it, similar to a “budget-neutral” approach used by the U.S. The push for a digital asset reserve comes after former U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order in March creating a national crypto reserve, potentially influencing lawmakers abroad to explore similar strategies. Swedish MPs Push to Add Bitcoin to National Reserves In April, two Swedish lawmakers urged Finance Minister Elisabeth Svantesson to consider adding Bitcoin to Sweden’s foreign exchange reserves , highlighting its similarities to gold and potential as a hedge against economic instability. Their proposal includes directly accumulating Bitcoin or adopting a budget-neutral strategy by keeping BTC seized in criminal cases instead of auctioning it. At the core of the Swedish lawmakers’ proposal is the belief that Bitcoin could serve as a digital gold, an asset capable of retaining value in times of economic upheaval. Notably, this method has allowed the US government to quietly build up large amounts of BTC, a move formalized in March when Donald Trump signed an executive order making Bitcoin part of the national reserve framework.

2025-07-05T09:29:00,"Best Cheap Crypto to Invest in and Make Up for Missing Bitcoin, XRP, and Solana Rallies.","Even the most hopeful investors can be humbled by the crypto market. You may have heard the success stories of people who bought Bitcoin (BTC) for $100, XRP for $0.005, or Solana (SOL) for $0.20 and turned little amounts of money into massive amounts. But for those who lost out on those moonshots, the real issue is: What’s next? While the big names still receive a lot of press, savvy investors are now turning to new, undervalued tokens that have significant potential for growth. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is the most important part of this movement. It’s a meme coin that’s gradually becoming the most inexpensive crypto buy of 2025. At just $0.0013 in its current presale stage, LILPEPE is offering early backers the kind of upside that Bitcoin and Solana once did — but with far more community hype and infrastructure from the get-go. Missed BTC, XRP, and SOL? You’re Not Alone Most retail investors didn’t buy Bitcoin in 2010 or 2015. They didn’t buy XRP before the 2017 Ripple hype. Many only heard of Solana after it soared past $100 in the last cycle. By then, the lion’s share of gains had already been made. The beauty of crypto, though, is that it constantly offers new opportunities. While large-cap assets like BTC and ETH may double or triple in the next bull run, micro-cap tokens like LILPEPE can 50x or more from their starting point, especially when built on strong foundations, viral branding, and early utility. Why LILPEPE is the Best Low-Cost Crypto Buy Right Now What separates Little Pepe (LILPEPE) from thousands of other meme coins isn’t just its low entry price. It’s that the project is bringing real utility and innovation to a meme category that’s often dominated by pump-and-dump tokens. Built on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token, LILPEPE is launching its own Layer 2 blockchain exclusively for meme coins. The chain is designed to be bot-resistant, lightning-fast, and virtually free of gas fees, solving major issues that plague new meme coin launches. More impressively, LILPEPE is launching a Meme Launchpad, a platform where new creators can build, mint, and launch their meme tokens directly on the LILPEPE chain. This ecosystem approach transforms LILPEPE from a meme into a decentralized factory of meme innovation. This is not just another frog-themed token. It’s the only meme coin positioning itself to become the infrastructure layer for an entire meme economy. Blazing Through Presale Stages and Raising Millions LILPEPE is currently in Stage 4 of its presale, priced at just $0.0013. With over $3 million raised so far and 2.6 billion tokens sold, the demand is clear. Early stages sold out in record time, and the momentum doesn’t appear to be slowing. But it’s not just the presale traction that has traders buzzing. The team recently launched the Little Pepe $777K Giveaway, where 10 winners will receive $77,000 worth of LILPEPE tokens. The campaign has exploded across crypto Twitter and Telegram, drawing attention from whales, influencers, and retail alike. Add to this the confirmed listings on two top centralized exchanges (CEXs) at launch, plus plans to debut on the biggest crypto exchange in the world, and it’s easy to see why many believe LILPEPE is next in line for a viral breakout. A Second Chance at Crypto Wealth Everyone dreams of buying the next Bitcoin at $1. Everyone regrets not investing $500 in SHIB before it skyrocketed to millions. But regret doesn’t pay the bills — action does. LILPEPE is offering a rare chance to get in on the ground floor of a coin that isn’t just a meme — it’s a meme movement. With strong tokenomics, real product development, major exchange support, and a presale price under a penny, the upside potential is enormous. While Bitcoin and Ethereum may still grow steadily over the coming years, only micro-cap gems like LILPEPE can deliver the kind of exponential returns that change lives. So, if you missed the last rallies, don’t let the next one pass you by. LILPEPE might just be the best cheap crypto to buy now if you’re looking to rewrite your crypto story in 2025 — and beyond.

The value of the Bitcoin in the slightly older wallet had risen from $7,805 to $1,092,370,050.73 at the time of the transfer, a gain of 13,995,672%. In the newer wallet, the value of the Bitcoin had jumped from $7,805 to $1,090,670,006.39, a 13,973,891% gain. The total value transferred from the ancient addresses adds up to $2,183,040,056. Bitcoin is trading at $109,061 at time of writing. While the wallets were dormant since April of 2011, they also received trace amounts of Bitcoin during the intervening period, possibly due to dusting attacks conducted to try to sniff out the entities behind the addresses. Dusting attacks are typically conducted by researchers, law enforcement officials or criminals. The phenomenon of long-dormant addresses suddenly getting active spurs media interest due to their potential link to the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, who remains a mystery more than one and a half decades since the crypto king was introduced to the world. The last known publicly verifiable online activity linked to Satoshi Nakamoto leads back to December of 2010 when the pseudonymous creator took to the BitcoinTalk forum to discuss a software update for Bitcoin meant to forestall denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

2025-07-05T09:00:00,"Bitcoin bulls struggle to breach $110k, memecoins PUDGY, BONK, FARTCOIN lead weekly chart","With macro concerns easing, Bitcoin bulls made an attempt to breach the $110,000 mark before pulling back. The total cryptocurrency market capitalisation, which had fallen to a weekly low of $3.36 trillion, rebounded to $3.48 trillion later in the week, driven by bullish developments out of the US. This late-week optimism pushed market sentiment higher, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index rising to 73, firmly within the Greed zone. Altcoins followed a similar upswing late in the week, but much of those gains were wiped out by Friday as Bitcoin once again failed to hold above $110,000, marking its third rejection at that level this month. Weekly momentum was largely driven by meme coins, which dominated the top 100 rankings during late Asian trading hours on July 4, capturing the spotlight with outsized gains amid broader market volatility. Why did Bitcoin go up? After some early‑week volatility, Bitcoin surged to a weekly high of $110,386 on Thursday, ignited primarily by the announcement of a landmark US–Vietnam trade agreement. Under the deal, Vietnam agreed to slash tariffs on US goods, with US tariffs dropping from previous levels of 46% to just 20%, with zero duties on imports entering Vietnam, significantly easing trade tensions and bolstering risk appetite across global markets. This diplomatic win, combined with a cooling of US export restrictions on semiconductors to China, propelled a meaningful risk-on shift, lifting equities and derivatives markets and cascading positive sentiment into crypto. Further, June’s non-farm payrolls data exceeded expectations with 147,000 jobs added, well above the projected 110,000, while the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%. Bitcoin extended its rally as traders priced in stronger consumer demand and near-term resilience, with flows into spot ETFs accelerating alongside a broader surge in risk markets. However, the fervor was short‑lived. As markets reassessed the data through the lens of Federal Reserve policy, traders scaled back expectations for a July rate cut, FedFunds futures showed a sharp rise in odds for no easing until at least September. That recalibration triggered a swift pullback, with Bitcoin dipping just under $109,000 as liquidity quickly shifted from crypto back to safer havens. What’s next for Bitcoin? Bitcoin bulls were thwarted in an attempt to regain support at $110,000 on Thursday as US employment data exceeded expectations, dealing a blow to hopes of interest-rate cuts before September. This is the third failed attempt since the May all-time high, casting doubt on Bitcoin’s ability to breach $110,000 and enter price discovery again. Historically, multiple rejections near all-time highs have preceded sharp drops in BTC price. For example, Bitcoin price was rejected multiple times from the $107,000 level in January, just 2% below the previous all-time high of $109,000 reached on Jan 20. This preceded a 14% price drop over the two weeks that followed. If history repeats, some analysts are worried the BTC/USD pair might drop 14%-18% from current price levels. Additionally, high-taker sell volume around $110,000 and neutral funding rates in futures markets point to profit-taking and hesitation among traders, increasing the likelihood of a pullback. Such trends are common when prices hover near all-time highs, often prompting long-term holders to realise profits and exit positions. Looking at the 24-hour liquidation heatmap for the Bitcoin BTC/USDT trading pair, it’s clear that there’s strong resistance around the $110,000 to $112,000 mark. These areas have consistently rejected upward momentum, confirming that sellers are dominating at higher levels and limiting Bitcoin’s ability to enter price discovery. Binance BTC/USDT Liquidation Heatmap. Source: Coinglass. On the downside, support appears to be forming near the $106,000 and $104,000 levels, with visible absorption and liquidations indicating renewed buyer interest. If current selling pressure intensifies, a breakdown below these thresholds could open the door for a deeper correction toward $103,000, where the next liquidation cluster lies. For now, Bitcoin could be moving rangebound between $103,000 and $110,000, unless market sentiment tilts decisively in either direction. One potential trigger for short-term volatility could be selling pressure from “Satoshi era” Bitcoin holders. Over the past week, a number of dormant whales re-emerged, most notably a coordinated move from eight wallets that had been inactive for over 14 years, collectively transferring out 80,009 BTC, worth an estimated $8.69 billion at the time of movement. Crypto Rover @rovercrc · Follow UPDATE:ALL 8 WALLETS WOKE UP AFTER 14 YEARS OF DORMANCY AND TRANSFERRED OUT 80,009 $BTC WORTH $8.69B. 8:52 PM · Jul 4, 2025 986 Reply Copy link Read 197 replies While the destination wallets remain unknown, such large-scale movements from early holders often signal internal rebalancing, custodial shifts, or potential liquidation, factors that tend to unsettle near-term market confidence when Bitcoin is already struggling to sustain new highs. Nevertheless, some analysts believe bullish developments in the US could reinforce momentum for Bitcoin and see it hitting new highs in the coming days. Much of that optimism centres on the potential impact of President Donald Trump’s so-called “Big Beautiful Bill,” a massive spending package expected to inject trillions into the US economy. The bill, which is reportedly being finalised around Independence Day, has already sparked renewed interest in risk assets, including Bitcoin. Historical precedents suggest this optimism may not be misplaced. When Trump signed a major COVID-19 relief bill in late 2020, Bitcoin jumped by 38% over the following weeks. If a similar reaction plays out again, a comparable rally would push BTC/USD well past $150,000. Crypto Rover @rovercrc · Follow THE LAST TIME TRUMP INTRODUCED A MASSIVE SPENDING BILL.BITCOIN PUMPED 38% IN JUST ONE WEEK.HE IS EXPECTED TO SIGN THE BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL INTO LAW TOMORROW.👀 1:32 PM · Jul 4, 2025 830 Reply Copy link Read 129 replies Markets are also factoring in the implications of mounting U.S. debt. Forecasts suggest the national debt could hit $40 trillion in 2025, nearly double the $23.2 trillion recorded at the start of 2020. From a macroeconomic standpoint, such aggressive borrowing has traditionally acted as a tailwind for Bitcoin, which thrives in environments of fiat dilution and fiscal expansion. If the “Big Beautiful Bill” becomes law, the flood of liquidity it unleashes may offset near-term resistance and profit-taking, setting the stage for Bitcoin to break out of its current range and resume its long-term uptrend. When writing, Bitcoin was hovering over $107,500, up just 0.3% over the past 7 days. Top Altcoin this week The total market cap of all altcoins rose 8% to a weekly high of $1.35 trillion before settling at around $1.29 trillion as of press time. Ethereum, the altcoin with the biggest market cap, was up 3.2% over the past 7 days, trading around $2,500 key support level. XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL), Tron (TRX), and Dogecoin (DOGE) held gains ranging between 2 and 7%. The highest gains this week were pulled by Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), which rose 62.7% over the period. Bonk (BONK) and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) followed with gains of 26.4% and 19.4% respectively. Source: CoinMarketCap PENGU rallied for seven straight days following a surge in interest after the Cboe BZX Exchange proposed the listing of the Canary PENGU ETF with the US securities regulator. Additionally, its listing on crypto exchange Biconomy.com and a surge in NFT sales over the past week also contributed to its price appreciation. Bonk’s rally this week followed after the project’s team disclosed plans to burn 1 trillion BONK tokens from circulation once the number of holders hits 1 million, a milestone that is aimed at creating long-term scarcity. According to data from CoinGecko Terminal, the current holder count stands at approximately 943,890. At this rate, the 1 million threshold is expected to be reached in the coming months. While no particular development could be identified for FARTCOIN’s gains when writing, it was likely driven by a broader rally across the memecoin market sparked by Bitcoin’s recovery this week.

2025-07-05T09:00:00,"LATAM crypto news: Costa Rica advances on crypto regulation as Blockchain boosts rice farming in Panama","Latin America’s crypto scene continues to evolve, with new products and regional expansions highlighting its rapid growth. This week’s most notable news is that Costa Rica moves forward with its plans to regulate crypto activities in the country as the sector rapidly expands. Panama, on the other hand, is introducing blockchain technology into rice production, becoming a regional leader in agricultural innovation. Costa Rica advances toward cryptocurrency regulation Costa Rica’s Legislative Assembly has submitted a ground-breaking law to regulate Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), which includes cryptocurrency exchanges. This legislation seeks to strengthen the General Superintendency of Financial Institutions (Sugef) capabilities by establishing a more robust framework for overseeing and controlling cryptocurrency transactions. If passed, the bill would require exchanges to develop client identification systems and rigorous Know Your Customer (KYC) processes. One of the bill’s core sections requires exchanges to gather and store detailed client and transaction data, particularly for politically exposed individuals and users in high-risk countries. The project aims to combat money laundering and terrorism financing by ensuring compliance with international financial security requirements. Sugef would also maintain a public list of authorised exchanges, guaranteeing that only compliant actors can operate legally. Blockchain boosts rice farming in Panama Panama has become a regional leader in agricultural innovation after incorporating blockchain technology into rice cultivation. The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and Panama’s Ministry of Agricultural Development (MIDA) are leading the project, which includes 106 local rice farmers who utilise blockchain to track crops, access real-time data, and make educated decisions that increase profitability. Farmers’ incomes have increased by an average of 98% thanks to satellite tools and over 60,000 technical reports, while environmental impact has been reduced through climate-smart practices such as the NAMA mitigation framework. This approach demonstrates how blockchain might promote sustainable agriculture and revolutionise business paradigms in Latin America. Young Argentines drive crypto adoption in Buenos Aires A recent Emergente Analytics analysis found that 7 out of 10 Bitcoin users under 30 in Buenos Aires are students , demonstrating early acceptance among young individuals in training. The poll, which was performed in September 2024 with 120 participants from Buenos Aires and its surrounding metropolitan region, also revealed that 80% of existing users identify as male, indicating a major gender disparity in the ecosystem’s early growth. Interestingly, nearly 70% of women surveyed who are not yet crypto users showed a desire to begin using cryptocurrencies soon, indicating a potential shift in gender composition. Social media emerged as the primary source of information, with perceived security, platform repute, and usability outweighing profitability and customer service when selecting a platform.

2025-07-05T08:56:32,"Brazil Central Bank Connector Hacked, $140 Million Stolen","C&M Software, the service provider linking Brazil Central Bank to local banks and financial institutions, suffered a significant security breach on Wednesday. The hack led to the theft of 800 million Brazilian reais (around $140 million) from six financial institutions connected to the central bank, in what is emerging as one of the country’s largest recent financial cyber incidents. According to Brazilian outlet São Paulo, the breach reportedly occurred after a C&M employee sold their login credentials for around $2,700, providing the attackers with access to critical software systems. The stolen funds were taken from reserve accounts within the system and swiftly moved out, causing alarm among stakeholders and regulators monitoring financial infrastructure in Brazil. Crypto Laundering Through LATAM Exchanges Onchain investigator ZachXBT reported that between $30 million and $40 million of the stolen funds were converted into Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and Tether (USDT). The attackers laundered these assets through various Latin American crypto exchanges and over-the-counter (OTC) desks, making fund recovery and tracing efforts significantly harder for authorities. This incident underlines the vulnerabilities that centralized software systems face, particularly those managing financial flows at a national level. Centralized systems carry single points of failure that can result in significant data theft or financial loss if exploited, and the problem is only growing as hackers refine their techniques with the help of artificial intelligence tools and dark web marketplaces. Calls for Privacy Tools and Decentralization Grow Cybersecurity experts note a sharp rise in attacks on centralized crypto exchanges in late 2024, according to Chainalysis, as hackers increasingly target platforms with large asset pools and consolidated control points. Eran Barak, CEO of Shielded Technologies, emphasized the need for privacy-preserving tools to guard against advanced AI-assisted hacking attempts. Barak argued that decentralized systems, particularly those leveraging zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), can reduce hackers’ incentives by requiring them to attack individual wallets rather than centralized vaults holding millions of credentials or billions in capital. “Their return on investment would be one record instead of millions, making these attacks far less attractive,” Barak explained. As the investigation unfolds in Brazil, this incident reinforces the urgent need for stronger cybersecurity and privacy infrastructure in the global financial sector, particularly as attackers expand their focus on centralized systems that remain high-value targets for financial crime .

2025-07-05T08:45:16,"Ripple CTO Says Bitcoin Creator Likely Holds Huge Amount of XRP, Court Document Reveals","A recently resurfaced court document from the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple has revealed that Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, suggested that the creator of Bitcoin, known under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, likely owned a substantial amount of XRP. This assertion was made during Schwartz’s deposition filed in 2023, as part of the ongoing legal proceedings brought by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission against Ripple Labs. The deposition transcript, shared online by the X account XrpHodL, includes Schwartz’s comments on how Ripple’s management of XRP compares to the distribution of Bitcoin. He pointed to Ripple’s operational control of XRP as a competitive advantage in building a payments ecosystem. On the topic of Bitcoin’s distribution, he acknowledged it is much harder to track due to its decentralized nature. Nonetheless, he stated: “Satoshi, the original Bitcoin creator, probably held an enormous amount of XRP at the time.” When asked what time, he said “2017”. Schwartz noted that Ripple deliberately focused on building infrastructure and utility around XRP as part of its payment solutions, while no comparable development efforts were undertaken for Bitcoin. According to him, the company’s ability to influence XRP’s ecosystem distinguished it from Bitcoin, whose distribution and control remain opaque. His deposition emphasized that Ripple’s direct role in XRP’s adoption set it apart from Bitcoin’s purely decentralized approach. David Schwartz said Satoshi holds $XRP … LINK TO COURT CASE PDF BELOW https://t.co/NgaHK0tbyE pic.twitter.com/0UH4Sc1QPK — (@XrpHodL_) July 4, 2025 We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Speculation Linking Schwartz and Nakamoto Schwartz’s statement that Satoshi “probably held an enormous amount of XRP” points to a possible connection between him and Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator. Although Schwartz has never claimed to be Nakamoto, various coincidences in the history of cryptocurrency development have fueled rumors. Observers have previously noted that the timeline of XRP Ledger’s development and Satoshi Nakamoto’s withdrawal from Bitcoin appear to align. Nakamoto announced his intent to “move on to other things” in 2011, which is also the year Schwartz began to publicly express interest in working on new projects. Further adding to this speculation is the fact that Schwartz, alongside Arthur Britto and Jed McCaleb, initiated development of the XRP Ledger shortly thereafter, which culminated in its 2012 launch. Ripple adopted the XRP Ledger as the foundation of its blockchain-based payment platform. No Evidence Confirms Schwartz as Satoshi Nakamoto Despite these observations and Schwartz’s comment on Satoshi’s supposed XRP holdings, there is no evidence confirming that Schwartz is the individual behind the Nakamoto pseudonym. His statement during the deposition has nonetheless added to the ongoing curiosity about the identity of Bitcoin’s creator and their potential involvement in other blockchain projects. While Schwartz’s remarks offer insight into how Ripple viewed its role in XRP’s development relative to Bitcoin’s trajectory, they remain speculative regarding Nakamoto’s holdings or identity.

Crypto has never been more in the cultural zeitgeist than it is in 2025. Ever since Donald Trump took the Whitehouse, Wall Street has been just as concerned with the price of Bitcoin ( BTC ) as it has been with Tesla, Nvidia, or the S&P 500. You might also like: Stablecoins: The gateway to mainstream crypto in 2025 | Opinion The free world has never been able to separate fringe technology from the mainstream—it eventually becomes the same, and we are now seeing this happen with crypto, and spearheading the transition is the humble stablecoin, a part of crypto that was once a shadowy effigy; is now out in the open for all to see. Stablecoins, thanks to being pegged against fiat currencies, can take on all the roles of traditional currency. From commercial bank integration to remittance payments, stablecoins have never been ‘cool’ in the memecoin or BTC sense; instead, it’s the one part of crypto that actively puts its head above the decentralised water and runs in tandem with pre-existing financial systems. In 2024, global stablecoin transactions passed $27.6tn and the stablecoin market capitalisation in 2025 sits at $238bn currently—and its adoption during this time has largely gone unnoticed. The demand for stablecoins has gone supersonic, thanks firstly to the world’s largest private banks. In 2019, JP Morgan developed the internally used JPM Coin to facilitate cross-institutional transactions. With the rapid growth of interbank transactions, which make up $1bn in stablecoin transactions daily, governments have had no choice but to regulate. Europe The European Union was the first governing body to blink first across the Atlantic. The Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) came into full force at the end of 2024 and offers a streamlined approach to regulation, prioritising consumer protection and anti-money laundering. The pro-consumer stablecoin landscape in the EU has allowed crypto to infiltrate everyday citizens’ lives like a wolf in sheep’s clothing. Trust and the implementation of robust, clear user guidance have been critical in the implementation of MiCA by the European Banking Authority . As a result, the stability created in the market led to an increase in EURC stablecoin transactions, from $7m to $21m between December and January 2025. There is a clear need, facilitated through banking institutions, for everyday consumers for stablecoins, especially in Europe, as cross-border transactions and remittance continue to become disproportionately more important in a world getting more comfortable with mass migration and open borders. The United States In the U.S., stablecoins have had a more nuanced path to infiltrating everyday use cases. JP Morgan may have been one of the first movers when it came to cross-institutional payments, but the U.S. opened the floodgates early, and under Gary Gensler, crypto was a hostage to archaic hang-ups and tin foil hat-inspired rhetoric, with Gensler claiming crypto was “unlikely [to] be a currency”, thanks to the fact that “the leading lights of this field are either in jail or awaiting extradition”. Crypto was never going to show its best side pre-regulation, and since Donald Trump took the White House in 2025, crypto regulation in the US is evolving at a rate not seen before; cue the GENIUS act. The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act, for the first time, gives both issuers and users of stablecoins clarity on their lawfulness within society and how they can be used. With this, the CFTC has also been announced as the primary regulator of digital commodities and payment stablecoins, further legitimising its position as part of the traditional finance furniture in the U.S. While the industry is still in its infancy compared to the EU, the impact that robust regulation will have for the rest of the world will be disproportionately more important. If the world salutes the Euro, then it bows to the dollar, and stablecoins will add yet another arrow to the dollar’s ever-growing quiver. Now that the stage is set and the world’s largest players have clarity, stablecoin adoption at both the institutional and consumer level is set to go supernova. Leading UK bank Standard Chartered has estimated the GENIUS act will “cause total stablecoin supply to rise from $230bn to $2tn by end-2028”. One of the largest infiltrations into traditional finance to date is the transfer of U.S. treasuries to stablecoin issuers, with $1.2tn in U.S. debt set to be bought by Tether, Circle, and other dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies by 2030. Once reserved for institutional stalwarts like Berkshire Hathaway, crypto is pulling up a seat at the TradFi table and is set to have a larger piece of the treasury pie than China, Japan & the UK in just five years. With the GENIUS Act and MiCA in full swing, and institutional driving stablecoin transactions, it will not be long before a lot of the FIAT capital flow globally will be represented by stablecoins. The Vice President of blockchain and digital assets at Mastercard, Raj Dhamodharan, recently highlighted that “most people won’t even know they’re using stablecoins” as the digital infrastructure required for crypto adoption is already in place. The physical money that backs up the number on our banking app will soon be pegged to a digital dollar or euro without most of the world ever knowing. It may sound strange, but if anything, banking is simply catching up with consumer demands—and although this revolution will be silent, its impact over the coming years will speak volumes.

2025-07-05T08:30:25,"Crypto Investor’s Wife Kidnapped for Ransom: Court Hands Down 12-Year Sentences","A court in Belgium has issued 12-year prison sentences to three individuals involved in the December 2024 kidnapping of the wife of a local cryptocurrency entrepreneur. The case, which has drawn attention within both legal and crypto communities, centers on a ransom demand made in digital assets, highlighting the growing concerns about the i ntersection of financial technology and physical security. Court Ruling and Ongoing Investigations The Brussels Criminal Court found the trio guilty of hostage-taking after abducting the victim outside her residence and forcing her into a van. The kidnappers reportedly demanded a crypto ransom in exchange for her release. Authorities acted swiftly after the woman’s husband, Stéphane Winkel, a known figure in the local crypto education scene, alerted law enforcement . Police intercepted the vehicle and executed a high-risk maneuver to halt it, freeing the victim and apprehending the suspects. In addition to the prison terms, the court ordered the convicted individuals to pay a civil compensation of at least €1 million (approximately $1.2 million) to the victim. While the sentences mark the legal conclusion for the three kidnappers, the case remains open in some respects. The court acknowledged that the principal figures behind the orchestration of the crime are still unknown. The defendants’ claims that they were acting under duress, allegedly threatened with death if they did not carry out the kidnapping, were dismissed by the court . The case also involves a minor, whose role is being addressed separately through Belgium’s juvenile justice system. According to reports from La Dernière Heure, the court emphasized the seriousness of the offense and the need to maintain deterrence, particularly in criminal activities intersecting with emerging financial sectors like crypto. The victim and her family have not been named in detail in court documents to protect their privacy, but the psychological toll has reportedly been substantial. The Effect on Winkel Family and Crypto Community Stéphane Winkel is known for his educational efforts within the cryptocurrency space . He runs platforms such as Crypto Académie and Crypto Sun, which aim to make digital asset investing more accessible to the public. His YouTube channel, which has roughly over 39,000 subscribers, typically featured tutorials, giveaways, and wallet walkthroughs. However, the traumatic incident has prompted a shift in both his personal and public life. In a post on X published shortly after the incident, Winkel stated, “I consider myself a defender of freedom, but I now realize that safety must become an absolute priority for me and those around me.” He also pledged to avoid public wallet demonstrations or promotional giveaways going forward, instead focusing his content on market analysis and education. After several months of silence, Winkel returned to YouTube in June 2025, opting for voice-only narration in his videos rather than appearing on camera, a move that aligns with his new emphasis on privacy and security.

The Central Bank of Brazil is actively working to recover the funds after discovering the offender. Central Bank’s Immediate Action Against the Crime After discovering the theft and the attacker, the central bank immediately issued a notice for a temporary suspension of C&M Software. By Wednesday, the company resumed limited operations under supervision. The federal police have opened an investigation at the Cybercrime Repression Department in Brasilia, investigating stolen funds and preventing further laundering in the chain. Currently, the police are investigating a series of questions about those responsible for the hacker attack, and other beneficiaries of the scam are being investigated. Discovery of Brazil’s Cyber Theft of $140 Million Approximately $140 million was theft by hacking C&M software, the service provider that connects Brazil’s central bank to local banks and other financial institutions. At least $30 to $40 million of the stolen funds were converted into cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin , Ethereum , and Tether. This conversation of fiat money into crypto was carried out via Latin American over-the-counter (OTC) brokers and crypto exchanges . Brazilian officers suspected a laundering route tied to Brazil’s PIX payments infrastructure (a system developed by the central bank to enable instant payments). [post_titles_links postid=”477206″] The Grand Theft Stemming from Internal Compromise Brazilian law enforcement confirmed that the breach stemmed from an internal compromise. João Nazareno Roque, a software employee at C&M, admitted to selling corporate private credentials to one of the attackers for R$5,000. The initial contact between the attacker and Roque occurred in March, when the suspect showed detailed knowledge of Roque’s job. Later, the employee was paid extra R$10,000 to execute the grand theft commands inside the system. Final Thought The incident of $140 million theft has triggered broad discussion on fintech cybersecurity, third-party provider risks, and regulatory oversight. While the case remains under investigation, Brazilian officials are targeting to end these cybercrimes altogether.

A dormant wallet holding 10,000 BTC reactivated after 14.2 years, realizing a staggering 3,176,464% ROI.

2025-07-05T08:00:58,"Why Crypto Market is Down Today? (05th July, 2025)","The post Why Crypto Market is Down Today? (05th July, 2025) appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market today has experienced a broad-based downturn today, with the total industry market capitalization slipping to $3.33 trillion. Trading volume also shrank considerably by 16.50%, now standing at $93 billion, signaling cautious attitude from investors. Bitcoin remains the dominant force with a 64.6% market share, followed distantly by Ethereum at 9.1%. A combination of macro events and sudden whale activity has injected fresh volatility into the digital asset space. The Fear & Greed Index rests at a neutral 51, reflecting indecision among market participants. A significant development casting a shadow over today’s action is the $3.6 billion crypto options expiry. Of that total, Bitcoin accounts for $2.98 billion and Ethereum $610 million. The unwinding of these contracts has led to volatility and uncertain short-term moves, as traders reassess risk amid high open interest. Whale Activity and Option Expiry Unnerve Investors? Bitcoin’s price has slipped by 0.68% over the last 24 hours, currently hovering around $108,294.97. While the dip may seem modest, the root cause is raising alarm bells. As a dormant wallet containing 80,009 BTC, which was inactive for over 14 years, has suddenly moved approximately $8.7 billion worth of tokens. Such activity typically highlights security concerns and fears of large-scale dumping, which often prompts a wave of defensive selling. This movement coincided with today’s massive options expiry event, further intensifying downward pressure. Also read our Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! Ethereum is not immune either. The second-largest crypto has declined 1.2%, now trading at $2,527.90. This pullback is largely linked to short-term profit-taking following a strong 4.09% weekly performance. Moreover, ETH faced stiff resistance near $2,600, which drove liquidations of over-leveraged long positions. Liquidation Shakeout Hits Market Liquidation events have further strained investor sentiment. Bitcoin’s leveraged long positions took a hit amid the dormant wallet scare, triggering cascading liquidations. The overall 24-hour trading volume for BTC has fallen by 14.9%, now at $42.47 billion. Ethereum’s fall is a case of technical rejection. The failed attempt to break above $2,600 led to profit booking and liquidation of weak hands. The combined pressure from options expiry and short-term resistance zones added fuel to the correction. XRP, meanwhile, is down 0.25% to $2.22 after failing to maintain its breakout above the $2.27–$2.30 range. The market also seemed underwhelmed by Ripple’s recent announcement about securing a banking license, which failed to generate strong bullish momentum.

2025-07-05T08:00:17,"Solana Tests Rising Channel Support – Breakdown Could Send Price To $128.50 Level","Solana is facing a critical test this week, consolidating in a tight range between $145 and $160 since Monday. The price action reflects strong buying interest but also hesitation as bulls struggle to reclaim higher levels. Despite holding above key support, Solana must break decisively above resistance to confirm a bullish breakout and continue its upward trend. Related Reading: Ethereum Forms Rising Wedge Pattern – $2,200 Support Back In Focus? Market momentum has favored bulls in recent weeks, but Solana’s inability to breach the $160 zone raises questions about the strength of this trend. Top analyst Carl Runefelt shared insights highlighting that Solana is currently ranging within a rising channel pattern—a structure that, while seemingly bullish, can often precede a breakdown to lower demand zones if support fails. This makes the coming days especially important for SOL’s trajectory. As macro conditions improve and Bitcoin flirts with new all-time highs, Solana is expected to respond in kind. However, technical signals suggest caution. A break below the rising channel could target the $128.50 support area, while a successful breakout above $160 could open the door to retesting local highs. Traders and investors alike are closely watching Solana’s next move in this high-stakes consolidation phase. Solana Holds Key Support Amid Rising Channel Formation Solana is currently trading below the $150 level, reflecting a notable 20% decline from its local high set in May. Despite this setback, the asset continues to hold a strong support base, signaling that bullish sentiment has not entirely faded. The broader market remains in a consolidation phase, with Solana showing signs of indecision as it moves sideways within a tightening price range. Analysts remain cautiously optimistic, pointing out that a breakout above the key $150–$160 supply zone could spark renewed upside momentum. However, the current price structure suggests that Solana may not be ready yet to retest previous highs. According to Carl Runefelt, Solana is ranging within a rising channel—a pattern that can lead to sharp movements if broken. While rising channels can sustain bullish continuation, a breakdown below the lower trendline often results in accelerated downside moves. Runefelt warns that if Solana breaks below the channel, the next key support area lies around $128.50. This level has historically acted as a strong demand zone and could serve as the next target in the event of a bearish move. In the meantime, Solana’s consolidation reflects broader market uncertainty, with traders waiting for a decisive breakout or breakdown to guide positioning. A successful reclaim of the $150 level would improve sentiment significantly and could set the stage for a push toward the $170–$180 range. On the other hand, failure to hold above current levels may shift the narrative toward further downside risk. Related Reading: Chainlink Consolidates Above Key Support – Bulls Eye $20 Range SOL Holds Range Amid Resistance Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $147.62, moving sideways within a tightening range and forming a potential rising channel pattern. The daily chart reveals that SOL has been unable to break decisively above the $155–$160 resistance zone, while strong support remains near the $140 level. Price action shows repeated rejections near the 100-day moving average (blue line), which now acts as dynamic resistance around $155.60. The 200-day moving average (red) sits further above $165.54, marking a long-term resistance area. Volume remains relatively low compared to early June spikes, suggesting market participants are waiting for a clear breakout direction. A push above $160 would likely trigger bullish momentum, potentially opening the door toward the $170 level. However, the rising channel identified by analysts suggests a possible downside risk if the lower trendline fails. Related Reading: Litecoin Surges Past Descending Resistance – Bulls Target $97.10 Level If Solana breaks below the $145 support and falls out of the channel, the next target would be the $128.50 area, which previously acted as a demand zone in mid-May.

The coming sessions may offer clarity as consolidation nears its resolution.

2025-07-05T07:48:54,"Bitcoin Price Crash Coming? Analyst Predicts 80% Drop Soon","The post Bitcoin Price Crash Coming? Analyst Predicts 80% Drop Soon appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin may seem bullish right now , but a leading crypto analyst has issued a shocking warning: a crash of over 80% could be just around the corner. While Bitcoin has climbed 3.3% in the last 30 days and currently trades at $108,161, concerns are building beneath the surface. Crypto analyst EDO FARINA XRP , who commands a following of more than 167,000 on X, believes Bitcoin’s rally is dangerously overheated. In a recent post, he predicted that a sudden, sharp correction is not just possible—it’s imminent. And when it hits, he warns, it will be fast and severe. Bitcoin Market Is Overheating According to the analyst, Bitcoin’s recent surge isn’t backed by fundamentals. Since the U.S. political shift in November 2024 , Bitcoin has surged by nearly 60%. In Q2 2025 alone, it delivered a quarterly return of 29.9%, and so far in July, it has grown by nearly 1%. But the economic backdrop tells a different story. Inflation in the U.S. has eased to 2.4%, close to the Federal Reserve’s target. Still, GDP growth is slowing—projected to drop to 1.8% in 2025. The labor market is cooling too, with unemployment rising to 4.1% in June, while consumer spending is expected to weaken. The analyst suggests this kind of economic environment doesn’t support such an aggressive BTC rally. Missed the Bitcoin Boom? EDO FARINA argues that the best time to buy Bitcoin was years ago. In 2020, BTC returned a staggering 304.1%, followed by a solid 59.6% in 2021. Although 2022 saw a major correction with a 64.3% drop, the market bounced back strongly—posting gains of 115.4% in 2023 and 121.1% in 2024. According to the analyst, today’s price level is no longer ideal for those seeking “safe” long-term gains. Bitcoin Whales Are Allegedly Selling Another red flag is the behavior of Bitcoin whales. The analyst claims that large holders, especially those owning Satoshi-era coins, are moving their BTC to exchanges. Each time the price approaches the critical $110,000 level, it faces strong resistance. For instance, on May 22, BTC touched $111,662. But by the next day, the market dropped nearly 4%. On June 10, Bitcoin climbed to $110,266, only to fall by more than 8% over the next 12 days. A similar trend occurred on July 3, when BTC touched $110,681 and dropped by 1.44% the very next day. These repeated sell-offs around the $110K mark suggest that whales are actively cashing out, keeping Bitcoin from breaking out to a new high. [post_titles_links postid=”478664″] The Real Concern: Low Trading Volume According to Farina, what’s even more dangerous than whale selling is the low trading volume in the current market. Compared to previous bull runs, fewer retail investors are buying. The analyst argues that today’s price action is driven by a few large players, not widespread demand. This poses a serious risk. If whales decide to dump their holdings all at once, there may not be enough buying support to hold the price up. This lack of liquidity could trigger a cascade of sell-offs and lead to a massive crash. Could Bitcoin Crash Soon? Farina believes the crash will be triggered by a major, unexpected event—what’s often called a “black swan” in financial markets. Once it happens, the crash will be swift and brutal, catching most investors off-guard. He concludes that Bitcoin’s current high is artificially inflated and not supported by real market activity. Without strong and broad demand, the price could collapse quickly when the pressure hits. While Bitcoin’s price action appears bullish , the warning signs are hard to ignore. Whale movements, resistance at $110K, weak economic fundamentals, and low volume suggest that the rally might not be as healthy as it looks. Whether this ends in a soft pullback or a dramatic crash, investors may want to stay alert.
