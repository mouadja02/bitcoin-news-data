2025-07-05T12:56:55,"Senator Lummis Introduces New Crypto Tax Bill With a $300 Tax-Free Threshold","Senator Cynthia Lummis has introduced a crypto tax bill that exempts capital gains of $300 or less and has a $5,000 annual exemption cap. The US Senator has introduced the bill to address what she believes is the unfair treatment of crypto traders. Lummis said that her tax bill will allow US citizens to engage with the crypto economy without inadvertently accruing a tax bill. Lummis justifies the viability of her bill by stating that the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimates it will generate $600 million by 2035. This is a significant step for the crypto community, which has faced uncertainty and regulatory hurdles for quite some time now, and would like to embrace financial innovations without having to deal with draconian tax requirements. “This groundbreaking legislation”, said Senator Lummis, “is fully paid-for, cuts through the bureaucratic red tape, and establishes common-sense rules that reflect how digital technologies function in the real world. We cannot allow our archaic tax policies to stifle American innovation, and my legislation ensures Americans can participate in the digital economy without inadvertent tax violations”. The Lummis Crypto Tax Bill would adhere to the current agenda made popular under President Trump, introducing commonsense tax legislation that allows American businesses to thrive in a competitive global market. Lummis has introduced a practical tax-free threshold for digital asset transactions that fall below $300, with an annual limit of $5,000 in transactions. In many countries, cryptocurrencies are not considered currencies, despite clear indications, including their name, as to the true intention of their creator. There remains considerable uncertainty regarding crypto regulation, particularly with respect to tax requirements. Senator Lummis’s bill, therefore, could be a very big breakthrough for crypto traders across the globe. With Lummis’ crypto tax, a person could buy a coffee without having to pay capital gains. It should be a matter of common sense that a person using cryptocurrencies to buy a coffee is not engaging in a serious investment, but is instead treating their cryptocurrency as a currency. The Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that Lummis’s bill would generate $600 million through 2034, a figure that Senator Lummis likes to remind people about. Lummis stresses that the bill reflects how cryptocurrencies are used in the real world. She has described her bill as a commonsense approach. The current government in the US has been focused on cutting red tape and creating regulation that seeks to deregulate the market. Lummis, therefore, is creating timely legislation that may have a good chance of succeeding. The implications for American crypto traders would be immense and would certainly lift a weight of uncertainty from their shoulders. Lummis is concerned that inadvertent tax penalties would discourage Americans from embracing technological innovation. Senator Lummis is a Republican politician from Wyoming. She could very well succeed in passing the bill due to the substantial magnitude of the tax exemption. America could very well become a crypto superpower if the industry is given appropriate tax incentives. Senator Lummis believes this is the case and stresses the need to provide Americans with commonsense tax requirements. Lummis has frequently been an outspoken advocate for Bitcoin and other digital assets. She believes that draconian tax requirements are preventing people from experimenting with cryptocurrencies. Lummis aims to create laws that encourage people to use cryptocurrencies without incurring large tax bills. The tax department should use incentives rather than punishments to support the tech sector. After all, punishments are less effective than incentives.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/senator-lummis-introduces-new-crypto-tax-bill-with-a-300-tax-free-threshold/,"REGULATION|MARKET|BTC","Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Cryptocurrency News",cryptocompare
2025-07-05T12:30:42,"Bitcoin Investor Sentiment Back To ‘Very Bullish’ — What This Means","The Bitcoin price action was largely sideways rather than strongly bullish for most of June. As of early July, the flagship cryptocurrency has maintained its movements around $108,000 – $110,000 region. While Bitcoin still retains its bullish market structure, recent on-chain data calls for a level of caution when investors are looking for opportunities in the market. Bitcoin Sentiment Recovers From Bearish In a July 4 post on the social media platform X, crypto analytics firm Alphractal revealed that the Bitcoin investor sentiment is “very bullish.” This on-chain observation is based on the Alpha Crypto Sentiment Gauge metric. Related Reading: XRP’s 30% Jump To $2.8: Analyst Says This ‘Classic Confirmation’ Must Happen First As its name suggests, the indicator evaluates the emotions of investors in the market, ranging from extreme fear to euphoria. These emotions are represented as color-coded interpretations, usually in red, yellow, light green, and dark green, and these further represent investor sentiment ranging from bearish to very bullish. In the chart shared by Alphractal above, the appearance of a dark green colour signals that the market sentiment is “very bullish” at the moment. Prior to their July 4 post, Alphractal reported in a June 23 post that the market sentiment was flashing bearish signals. In the post on X, the analytics firm warned that the bears could be in trouble. Interestingly, the bears were indeed in trouble, as Bitcoin picked up more buying momentum, consequently liquidating several bearish positions. However, Alphractal explained that sighting green does not necessarily mean the market may be at a top. Instead, it signals that euphoria is taking over the market, which, according to the analytics firm, unlocks a wave of opportunities for Bitcoin buyers. Alphractal said: On the other hand, red zones are usually short-lived, but offer exceptional buy opportunities — like no other indicator can. As the market displayed, the bearish signal interpreted from the Sentiment Gauge eventually provided more buying opportunities. Growing market euphoria is not the only meaning that can be derived from a green signal in the market. It could also serve as a warning for potential overconfidence in the market as Bitcoin continues to gain value. If history is anything to go by, the market could experience rapid price expansions and an increase in investor risk-on approach. On the other hand, the “very bullish” sentiment could also precede sharp corrections, especially if fueled by crowd emotion, rather than market fundamentals. Whether this green sentiment signals the next price leg up, or the establishment of a market top is yet to be known — as a result, traders are advised to remain alert. Bitcoin Price At A Glance After its early show of strength on Thursday, Bitcoin has lost nearly 2% of its value in the past 24 hours. As of this writing, the premier cryptocurrency is valued at about $107,754.

2025-07-05T12:30:29,"Russia goes after illegal miners with new registry for crypto mining rigs","Government departments in Russia have created a special register for coin mining equipment to help local authorities in their efforts to curb illegal mining activities. The initiative of the executive power in Moscow comes amid an ongoing crackdown on miners working outside the law in Russian regions, often powering their crypto farms with stolen electricity. Russia registers mining hardware to track down rogue miners Russia’s Ministry of Energy, the Federal Tax Service (FNS) and the Ministry of Digital Development have compiled a register of devices used for cryptocurrency mining, RIA Novosti reported , quoting Deputy Energy Minister Petr Konyushenko. The gathered information has already been shared with authorities in the Russian regions witnessing increased miner activity, the government official revealed in an interview with the leading news agency, elaborating: “The creation of such a register will allow us to accurately identify consumers using electricity for mining needs. This is necessary in order to apply special regulation and taxation to those.” Konyushenko described the move as a step towards legalizing the whole industry while reducing the illegal consumption of electricity, which has been blamed for losses for the power distribution companies and the state as well as energy deficits in parts of the country. The energy ministry pitched the idea to establish a unified register of mining equipment during a working meeting on the regulation of digital currency extraction in February. The proposal was also backed by the Russian Ministry of Industry in May. Russia legalized cryptocurrency mining with a law adopted in the summer of 2024. It allows both companies and individual entrepreneurs to legally mint digital coins in the Russian Federation, provided they register with the tax authority and pay due taxes. Private citizens are allowed to mine without registration as long as their electricity consumption does not exceed a limit set by the government, which is currently 6,000 kWh a month. However, all miners, including the latter, are obliged to inform the FNS about the amount and the value of the mined cryptocurrency. Moscow cracks down on illegal crypto farms amid mining ban Russia, which has established itself as a major player in the global Bitcoin mining market over the past few years, has been struggling to bring its miners out of the shadows ever since it legalized the industry last year. Less than a third of all Russian mining enterprises have so far registered with the FNS and the new register of mining machines aims to increase the share of legal mining businesses. Other Russian authorities have also joined the hunt for underground miners. In June, the national grid operator Rosseti announced it’s developing a mechanism to pinpoint illegal mining facilities by tracking internet traffic with the help of telecom companies and mobile operators. To limit the negative consequences of the mining boom, which has caused electricity shortages, the Russian government has also imposed seasonal and permanent restrictions on the activity in parts of the vast country. Mining has been completely banned for six years in a dozen regions. This week, President Vladimir Putin justified the measures with the need to balance the exploitation of Russia’s natural resources. At a forum devoted to discussing development initiatives, Putin said that governors have been complaining about growing energy deficits and admitted: “We were forced to make certain decisions in the mining sphere.” Meanwhile, Russian law enforcement and other officials have been cracking down on mining facilities illegally tapped into electricity networks in energy-deficient regions. Last month, the authorities in Krasnoyarsk Krai, a major mining hotspot in Siberia, busted a massive crypto farm occupying almost 30,000 square meters of land, officially registered as a non-residential building on an industrial plot.

2025-07-05T12:30:00,"MUTM keeps climbing as XRP fails: is this the top crypto of July 2025?","Ripple’s XRP had a turbulent run in June, which saw the coin lose momentum. The price hovered around $2 even amid an ambitious announcement by Ripple Labs’ CEO. However, July could be different for the crypto market, and investors are paying attention. The fundamentals in the crypto sector look strong, which could signal that a massive run is in the works. To capitalize on this run, XRP whales are looking for small, promising projects that signal a massive upside. So far, one of the best projects that analysts have identified is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . All signs point to the MUTM token outperforming XPR in the upcoming rally, and investors are capitalizing on this positive forecast. July 2025 has seen a massive rush into the Mutuum Finance presale, and we will dive deep into this trend to help you understand what is going on. The protocol design Mutuum Finance is a DeFi lending protocol that lets users participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. As lenders, they deposit their assets into the pools for the chance to earn interest. Meanwhile, borrowers can deposit their collateral into the pools to access the liquidity in the pools. The stability of the entire ecosystem is protected via over-collateralization. This process ensures that the value of collateral is always higher than the value of borrowed assets. To achieve capital efficiency, interest rates in the pools are based on the pool utilization rate. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale breaks records The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is currently in phase 5, where tokens are going for $0.03. So far, the presale has raised over $11.7 million from around 12,700 unique buyers. At the rate at which tokens in phase 5 are selling out, there may not be any left for you. So far, over half of the tokens set aside for the phase have been sold, barely a month after they went on sale. One of the main drivers of the current phase of the presale is that the price is a 50% discount on the final launch price of $0.06. Most observers of the presale expect the tokens in phase 5 to sell out by the end of July. With 60% of the tokens already sold, this could be a reality soon. As such, now is the time to get your tokens while the massive discount is still available. In the upcoming phase 6, the token price will go up by 16.67%, wiping out this discount. How high could MUTM tokens rise? According to the latest analysts’ projections, the price of MUTM tokens could go up by 4400% when they launch. That means a $1600 investment in the presale today could grow to over $70,000. That is a massive return that no one should miss out on. Best of all, the presale has no upper caps on how much you can invest. Consequently, your return could easily be double or triple the $70k, depending on how much you decide to invest. One of the reasons why analysts are so confident about the future of MUTM tokens is due to the current market conditions. For instance, it is worth noting that while crypto prices are in a consolidation phase, there have not been massive outflows of capital. The price of BTC remains at around $105,000, which is a huge change from past performance. In the past, after a huge rally, like the one in May 2025, the price of BTC would sometimes fall by double digits. However, this time, the price of BTC has basically stagnated. That means there have not been major outflows, thanks in part to the entry of institutional investors in the sector. The current conditions mean that the next rally will be bigger than anything experienced before in the crypto market. It could be the final rally before the crypto market finally stabilizes and matures. As such, this MUTM token presale represents the last opportunity to make truly massive returns in the crypto sector. Mutuum Finance partners with CertiK To ensure the long-term protection of its users, Mutuum Finance recently announced a partnership with CertiK. The two will partner on a $50,000 USDT bug bounty program. The program will be split into four tiers, which are critical, major, minor, and low. This will ensure that those security experts who identify the biggest issues will receive the biggest rewards. MUTM is the crypto to watch in July 2025 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents an exciting opportunity for massive gains. So far, 60% of the tokens set aside for phase 5 have been sold, less than a month after they launched. With a 50% discount available to phase 5 buyers, this is the time to act. In the next phase, the token price will go up by double digits, greatly diminishing the discount you will get.

While most retail investors remain cautious as the bitcoin price continues to consolidate around $108k. In the meantime, Bitcoin’s “mega whales” are quietly adding to their stacks. This quiet accumulation might be a strong signal of what’s coming next for Bitcoin’s price. Mega Whales Keep Accumulating Recent data shows more Bitcoin wallets now hold over $10 million worth of Bitcoin. This number has grown by 4.23%, which means big investors and rich companies still trust Bitcoin. These big players are not buying because of hype, they are buying quietly now, hoping for a bigger price jump later. Smaller wallets are doing the same. Wallets with $100,000 to $1 million in Bitcoin have gone up by 2.71%, and wallets with $1 million to $10 million have increased by 2.34%. This steady buying shows that many people still believe Bitcoin will grow more in the future, especially if new ETFs bring in more money and governments stay supportive. Price Still Range-Bound, But Whales Stay Calm Right now, Bitcoin has been stuck trying to break above the key resistance between $107,000 and $110,000 . So far, it’s mostly been bouncing around this area without a strong breakout. Even though excitement among smaller traders hasn’t fully returned, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at a healthy 55, showing there’s still room for upward momentum without the market being overbought. What’s different this time is the patience. These big players aren’t chasing short-term gains. Their buying looks slow and deliberate, suggesting they expect something bigger in the long run. Bitcoin Eyeing New ATH: $120k History shows that whale accumulation often happens before major rallies. If Bitcoin can break above the $110,000 resistance with strong volume and hold its ground, the next target could be the psychological $120,000 mark.

2025-07-05T12:07:29,"Bitcoin to Benefit Immensely from Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill: White House Advisor","US Presidential advisor Bo Hines has tweeted that the crypto economy, especially Bitcoin , is set to benefit immensely from Trump’s recently signed “Big, Beautiful Bill” . The US House of Representatives passed the bill symbolically on the 4th of July, following an earlier nod by the Senate. Initially, there was significant opposition to the bill, including some staunch resistance within the President’s Republican party; however, it may be precisely what crypto users need in times of regulatory uncertainty. What is Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill? The main focus of the major legislation is on three of Trump’s key policy positions: tax cuts for companies, reduced regulations, and enhanced border control. While these three issues received major mention in the bill, some crypto-friendly Acts managed to pass through as part of the package, with strong bipartisan support. This level of cross-aisle support demonstrates just how popular cryptocurrency is among the American public. They include the Genius Act and the Clarity Act, both of which address the regulatory climate of the USA. The Genius Act sets clear rules regarding the circulation of stablecoins in the country while being open to innovative ideas coming from the sector, Hines stated . The Clarity Act, on the other hand, aims to address the major legal conundrum faced by cryptocurrencies, not just in the USA but worldwide. According to the White House advisor, this legislation draws a clear line between a digital commodity and a digital security, paving the way for crypto innovation without legal complications in the USA. Hines further states that the “Big, Beautiful Bill” will make the country a global leader in crypto innovation and adoption. He gave the President high praise and noted that it was a significant milestone for the country. Will Trump’s Bill Kickstart a New Crypto Revolution in the USA? Pro-crypto legislation and crypto-friendly policies were a major part of Donald Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign. It was in complete contrast to his opponent Kamala Harris, who failed to capitalize on the pro-crypto entirely. The Clarity Act and the Genius Act are likely to significantly support the cause of digital currencies in the country if implemented in full spirit. Trump is likely to claim that a significant portion of his promise to implement crypto reforms has been fulfilled. However, hawkish federal agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the FBI will need to be on board for this crypto regulation to succeed. The latter has historically treated digital currencies like a tool used by criminals, so that a complete rewiring may be on the cards in the coming days, especially under Trump’s FBI chairman, Kash Patel.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-to-benefit-immensely-from-trumps-big-beautiful-bill-white-house-advisor/,"REGULATION|BTC|EXCHANGE","Bitcoin|Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Donald Trump|Ethereum News",cryptocompare

2025-07-05T12:02:42,"Canadian woman drags service provider to court over 12 BTC SIM swap scam","A Canadian woman has sued a phone company over the theft of her Bitcoin worth $531,000 in 2021, in a SIM swap scam. The victim, a pharmacy manager, alleges that the lost Bitcoin, now worth roughly $1.8 million, was stolen after a cellphone store employee gave her personal information to a hacker. The victim, Raelene Vandenbosch sued Rogers Communications and Match Transact Inc. in three provinces, alleging that the loss she suffered from the SIM swap scam was the fault of an employee of a phone kiosk owned by Match. Now, the Supreme Court in British Columbia (B.C.) has ruled that the issue be resolved in private arbitration, outside a courtroom. Canadian woman loses BTC in SIM swap scam According to a court filing submitted by the Canadian, she approached Rogers about the situation when she first discovered it. The Canadian woman said she was offered a refund on one month’s service, worth about $95. Vandenbosch then filed lawsuits in Ontario, Quebec, and B.C. to recoup more. Vandenbosch said the funds were stolen after a hacker pretending to be a technician from Rogers convinced a Match-owned mobile store employee in Montreal to share their computer screen. The Canadian native said the action allowed the hacker to gain access to her account information, even though she was in B.C. at the time. The hacker then proceeded to download all her account information onto a SIM card that was in their possession. After the deed, the hacker then allegedly hijacked her account, locking her out and stealing her Bitcoin in the process. Vandenbosch is suing for negligence, breach of privacy, and breach of contract. The Canadian is also seeking restoration of the amount that the Bitcoin was at the time of the theft and other damages and admission of guilt. In response, Rogers and Match have filed a response in court, with none of them admitting or denying the allegations. Instead, they have argued that they could resolve the issue through arbitration rather than in a courtroom. Vandenbosch also signed an arbitration agreement with Rogers as part of her cellphone plan. In a ruling by the B.C. Supreme Court Justice Anita Chan, the case is expected to go to arbitration, except for the part seeking a public admission of wrongdoing, which the judge has ruled can proceed because it is in the public interest. The judge did not rule on the facts of the case in her decision. The result could mean that if Vandenbosch continues to pursue the suit and either company is forced to admit fault, then she does not get paid back for the lost BTC. A spokesperson representing Rogers has defended the company and its security record. The spokesperson also highlighted the risk associated with digital assets. “As fraudsters use constantly evolving techniques to try and take advantage of consumers across the wireless industry, we continually strengthen our security measures to protect our customers against fraudulent activity,” the spokesperson said. Vandenbosch contends arbitration ruling In her initial filing, the Canadian said that the hacker allegedly gained access to her crypto accounts on Ledger and Shake Pay, stealing over 12 BTC, worth around $534,000 at the time. The stolen Bitcoin is now worth over $1.8 million as of today’s price. She is accusing Match of negligence and breach of privacy for failing to protect her personal information. She also claims Rogers failed to protect her privacy by allowing kiosk workers access to too much personal information and failing to mandate verification questions. Meanwhile, the Canadian native has argued that she should not be required to go through arbitration because of the amendments made by the B.C. government to the Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act in March. The government amended the legislation to bar cell phone companies from imposing these agreements on customers, arguing that forced arbitration hurts users. Vandenbosch said that these new laws should be retroactively applied to her case, but Justice Chan disagreed, saying the rules are not meant to be retroactive. “The prohibition came into force on Royal Assent of Bill 4 on March 31, 2025, and applies to new disputes that are launched after the date of Royal Assent,” a spokesperson from the B.C.

2025-07-05T12:00:00,"Bitmine Immersion: $250 Million PIPE Redefines The Balance Sheet, But Valuation Looks Stretched Already","Summary BitMine Immersion has secured a pivotal $250 million PIPE to initiate an Ethereum corporate treasury strategy, fundamentally redefining its capital structure. The capital fuels a strategic shift towards a large Ethereum treasury and business expansion into higher-margin Bitcoin Treasury Advisory and Mining-as-a-Service offerings. BMNR trades at a 52.82x price-to-hold ratio (current BTC only) and a pro forma 3.29x (including planned ETH treasury), representing a notable premium compared to peers like MSTR, MARA, and RIOT. While the capital infusion is a significant positive, a hold rating is initiated due to the current rich valuation. Bitmine Immersion Technologies ( BMNR ) is the latest company to adopt the crypto corporate treasury strategy. As publicly traded companies increasingly adopt the crypto-backed balance sheet approach, it is becoming increasingly important for investors to develop a framework for evaluating companies pursuing such strategies. In the last month, I've covered a series of companies that recently adopted a crypto-backed corporate balance sheet. And part of the approach I've taken to analyze these companies includes an assessment of the underlying business (if any), the strategic intent for adopting a crypto treasury strategy, and the potential near and long-term implications for the company's capital structure. My recent coverage of SharpLink Gaming ( SBET ), a digital sports media and performance marketing firm, that adopted an Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) corporate strategy with a $463 million ETH buy last month, showed significant supply overhang from equity fund raises and potential for heavy dilution. Another company I covered recently was Next Technology ( NXTT ), a Chinese tech firm that touts AI and blockchain service offerings in addition to its recent pivot to a Bitcoin corporate treasury strategy. An in-depth analysis revealed that no tangible backstop business exists yet for the company, nor were there any working products in its acclaimed tech verticals, nor revenue, nor backlog yet. This underscores the critical importance of due diligence when investing in crypto treasury companies. This article initiates coverage on Bitmine Immersion, examining its core Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining business and its pivot to Bitcoin and Ethereum treasury strategy, and the broader implications of this pivot. The main goal is to give investors a grounded view of what's driving this stock, how sustainable the thesis is, and whether there is long-term value beyond the current hype created by the crypto treasury pivot. Bitmine Immersion Technologies - Company Profile Bitmine calls itself a ""Bitcoin network company that drives value through BTC treasury and multiple Bitcoin income streams."" As its primary business, Bitmine mines Bitcoin just like any other Bitcoin miner. The company currently operates two mining sites in Texas and two mining sites in Trinidad and Tobago. One of Bitmine's main differentiators in the mining business is its use of immersion-cooled infrastructure, which involves submerging ASIC miners in thermally conductive liquid instead of relying on the more common air cooling. Immersive cooling isn't novel or proprietary to Bitmine, but Bitmine is one of the miners that has fully adopted this cooling method as the only operational standard. I covered the benefits of immersive cooling last year in an article for MARA Holdings ( MARA ), where I talked extensively about MARA's two-phase immersion cooling system. Just a side note, If you are interested in understanding what it entails and the implications for mining operations and long-term OpEX reduction, you can refer to that piece on Mara Holdings , which explains it in detail. Bitmine calls part of its model ""synthetic mining,"" which is to acquire Bitcoin hashrate not by buying hardware but via leasing or contract-based access to mining power, essentially paying for the right to use the hashrate without owning the underlying machines. It is like an institutional-grade version of cloud mining. In cloud mining, smaller retail miners typically prepay for a fixed slice of hashrate from a provider, while in this case, it is large-scale miners that lease the equipment or the output through structured agreements. Synthetic mining is also different from colocation or traditional hosting arrangements, in that, in synthetic mining, as Bitmine defines it, hashrate exposure is secured via futures or revenue-sharing contracts, and they do not own or operate the physical ASICs themselves. An instance of this is the 12-month forward contract with Luxor, a hashrate derivatives provider, which allowed Bitmine to pre-sell future hashrate in exchange for upfront capital to finance new ASICs. BMNR was uplisted to NYSE last month, following a 1 for 20 reverse stock split in May, and a public offering of 2,250,000 shares of its common stock at $8.00 per share. BMNR is up over 3,000% since announcing the initiation of an Ethereum treasury strategy last month. How A PIPE Capital Infusion Changes The Math For Bitmine Bitmine has had a crescendo of catalysts in the space of a month that has set off a rally for the stock: NYSE uplisting in early June, followed by the announcement of the purchase of 100 BTC for the Bitcoin treasury strategy. The 100 BTC was purchased with the $18 million raised from the public offering mentioned earlier, and an additional 54.167 BTC were purchased on June 17, bringing the company's total BTC in treasury to 154.167 BTC. Then, the most recent crown jewel of $250 million PIPE to initiate an Ethereum treasury strategy . These are well-timed announcements, if you ask me. Bitmine has also launched a Bitcoin Treasury Advisory Practice , an expansion into potential higher-margin service offerings. As part of this push, the company signed a $4 million deal with a U.S.-listed firm to lease 3,000 ASIC miners through 2025 and provide $800k worth of consulting services focused on Bitcoin Mining-as-a-Service (MaaS) and corporate treasury strategy. According to management, this single deal surpasses Bitmine's total FY24 revenue which was $3.3 million, suggesting that advisory services could become a meaningful growth driver for the company. In the recently released financials of Bitmine's latest 10-Q , which is for fiscal Q3 2025, there are several interesting line items in the analysis of the capital structure of Bitmine. I'll also show how the announced $250 million PIPE raise is the most significant and transformative event in the history of the company by integrating the impact into the balance sheet of the company. Income statement (10-Q) On the income statement for FQ3, we can see the emergence of consulting revenue of $35k. Though it is still a small figure compared to total revenue, its emergence on the income statement is still evidence of Bitmine's new Bitcoin treasury advisory business line. Another consideration is that the majority of the consulting revenue from the $4 million deal is still unrecognized, hence the large increase in Customer Advances line on the balance sheet. Balance sheet (10-Q) One noteworthy line on the balance sheet is the over 100% increase in customer advances, jumping from $703k to $1.8 million YoY, clearly showing upfront payments for services yet to be rendered, a direct reflection of the new revenue streams. Beyond this, the balance sheet also shows a substantial increase in cash and cash equivalents, rising from $499k to $1.4 million. Cryptocurrencies held also increased from just $78k about a year ago to $1.2 million as of FQ3 end in May. Current assets increased from $1.56 million to $2.18 million, and that number is likely to jump significantly when the $250 million PIPE closes and most of the proceeds go to the planned Ethereum treasury holdings. And considering that the fund is from a PIPE equity raise, there will likely not be a matching increase in current liabilities. That would put Bitmine's balance sheet on a relatively similar attractive footing with peers that have also adopted a BTC and ETH treasury strategy like Bit Digital ( BTBT ). But for now, and based on the FQ3 results, Bitmine's balance sheet lacks significant underlying financial strength in short-term liquidity. To make the situation worse, loans payable to related parties and the interest accrued on these related party loans are about $2.4 million in total. This alone exceeds the $2.18 million total current assets of the company, which is an alarming concern. Bitmine appears to be a highly leveraged business. Total shareholders' equity in the FQ3 balance was $2.9 million. This makes up about 35% of the $8.3 million in total assets, while the remaining ~65% ($5.4 million of total assets) are funded by liabilities. Bitmine's debt-to-equity ratio ($5.4 million / $2.9 million) is currently 1.87. For every dollar of owner's capital, Bitmine has roughly $1.87 in debt. This high leverage is on the verge of being rectified. $250 million from the PIPE means equity will increase by roughly that amount, which will cause the debt-to-equity ratio to plummet and deleverage the company's balance sheet. Shareholders' equity breakdown (10-Q) Bitmine's FQ3 balance sheet shows a significant Accumulated Deficit of $13.9 million, which is the cumulative net losses the company has incurred over its history, and this directly erodes the total Stockholders' Equity because it is recorded as a negative component of equity. While the company has managed to raise substantial capital in the past, evidenced by the $16.8 million in Additional Paid-in Capital [APIC], this capital has largely been offset by the company's historical net losses, leaving a net shareholders' equity of only $2.9 million. The shareholders' equity would have been larger if not for the accumulated deficit. Here's where the PIPE funds play another vital role in Bitmine's capital structure, as it will certainly swell the APIC and in turn swell total equity. Almost every dollar will go into the APIC line as the $4.50 price from the PIPE is significantly above the nominal par value of BMNR ($0.0001 per share). If we infuse the ~$250 million into the APIC, it will surge to over $266.8 million (from the current $16.8 million), leading to a massive increase in total equity. With Bitmine's total shareholders' equity of $2.9 million, a net loss of, say, $2 million in a quarter, would wipe out a significant portion (over 60%) of its equity. But with the ~$250 million injection into the equity, the total equity becomes ~$252.9 million; and under this new equity base, if the company still loses $2 million in a quarter, that loss would represent only a tiny fraction (less than 1%) of its new equity base. This significantly increases the company's financial resilience and provides a substantial buffer against future operational losses. Like I said earlier in this piece, the $250 million from the PIPE is the crown jewel and game-changer for Bitmine. The current capital structure of the company, characterized by high leverage and a small equity base largely eroded by accumulated deficit, but the PIPE fundamentally transforms this by infusing massive equity, drastically reducing reliance on debt, and enabling all of the company's strategic pivot. By the time FQ4 results are released and the new capital structure is reflected, I believe Bitmine will have a more attractive balance sheet and greater financial flexibility, like several of its peers. BMNR is up a lot lately and for good reason; the market has reacted to the $250 million PIPE and the ETH treasury strategy. My main goal in this piece has been to help readers understand the nuances beyond just the fresh injection of funds for ETH purchase for treasury purposes. The ETH pivot is what the market has largely reacted to. But beyond that pivot, I've shown the dramatic transformation of the company's capital structure and the journey toward enhanced liquidity and financial resilience. BMNR price trend (Seeking Alpha) Bitmine currently holds ~154 BTC, which has a carrying value of $16.6 million at the current $107,700 per BTC spot price as of July 4, 2025. Then, assuming it buys ETH with the total $250 million from the PIPE, that would give a total crypto assets holdings value of around $266.6 million (if we add the ETH purchase to the BTC holding). At BMNR current market cap of $877 million, BMNR's pro forma price-to-hold ratio (stock price against the per-share value of their crypto holdings) would be 3.29x. If we consider only the current BTC and do not include projected figures for the ETH treasury, we'd have a 52.82x ($877 million / $16.6 million) p/hold multiple for BMNR. This is in very expensive territory and not on the side of undervaluation to net asset value when compared to crypto treasury peers with stronger visibility and more robust core operating businesses, like Strategy ( MSTR ), Riot Platforms ( RIOT ), or MARA. This reinforces that BMNR is expensive at the current price level. Top 5 Bitcoin treasury holdings ( bitcointreasuries.net) MSTR currently trades at a p/hold multiple of 1.76x, MARA trades at 1.16x, and RIOT trades at 2.10x (you can get each of these p/hold numbers by dividing the market by the dollar value of the Bitcoin holdings for the respective companies). Bitmine's current p/hold is way more expensive and even the pro forma p/hold of 3.29x still suggests a notable premium relative to its digital asset holdings, especially if we consider the fact that all the aforementioned companies in the p/hold comp in this analysis all have way more robust core businesses and substantial revenue compared to Bitmine's. I am therefore initiating coverage on BMNR with a Hold rating. As an investor, I'll be closely monitoring how the company deploys the fresh capital, grows its treasury assets, and executes on its core Bitcoin mining operations. These all will be key indicators of whether Bitmine can transition from speculative upside to sustainable value creation, and whether its current valuation can eventually justify a long-term investment thesis.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4799368-bitmine-immersion-250-million-pipe-balance-sheet-valuation-looks-stretched?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|REGULATION|BUSINESS|MINING|ETH","SBET|ETH-USD|NXTT|BTC-USD|BTBT|MSTR|RIOT|BMNR",cryptocompare
2025-07-05T11:58:41,"Singapore Slams Banks, Crypto as $3B Money Laundering Scandal Ends","The post Singapore Slams Banks, Crypto as $3B Money Laundering Scandal Ends appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In one of the biggest financial enforcement moves in its history, Singapore has fined nine major financial institutions a total of S$27.5 million (US$21.5 million) for failures in anti-money laundering (AML) controls. This comes in the final chapter of a S$3 billion money laundering scandal that rocked the city-state in 2023. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) confirmed the penalties on Thursday, naming global banks like Credit Suisse, UBS, Citibank, UOB, Julius Baer, LGT Bank, and asset manager Blue Ocean among those penalized. Yes, this is serious. Read on for the details! The Assets That Sparked the Crackdown This massive case first surfaced in August 2023, when police raided multiple properties and arrested ten Chinese nationals, later linked to organized criminal groups. Authorities uncovered billions in illegal funds tied to luxury real estate, cash, and cryptocurrencies . The individuals were later sentenced to prison terms between 13 and 17 months, deported after serving time, and permanently banned from returning to Singapore. Credit Suisse Fined the Most Among the banks involved, Credit Suisse’s Singapore branch received the largest fine of S$5.8 million. MAS cited “poor or inconsistent implementation of AML controls” as the reason. Others, like UBS, Citi, and UOB, were also fined for similar lapses. UOB, Singapore’s third-largest bank, said it has already taken corrective steps to strengthen compliance. MAS has also issued prohibition orders lasting up to six years against four individuals linked to the case. This is Singapore’s most serious regulatory action since 2016, when the MAS shut down BSI Bank over its role in the 1MDB scandal. [post_titles_links postid=”478986″] Crypto Is Being Closely Watched While the focus is on traditional banks, crypto had a role to play. Some of the seized assets were in cryptocurrencies, pulling the digital asset sector into the spotlight once again. And it’s happening at a time when Singapore is tightening crypto regulations . Under new rules that kicked in this June: Crypto firms offering overseas services must be licensed under the FSMA by June 30, 2025 Retail investors are banned from using credit or receiving incentives Transactions over SGD 1,500 require full ID checks under the Travel Rule DeFi frontends and wallets that serve retail users or earn from token-based services may now fall under MAS oversight Crypto innovation is welcome, but not without strong compliance. A Warning Shot to Banks and Crypto Firms Singapore is raising the bar on financial integrity. And as crypto becomes more embedded in the global financial system, these rules aren’t just for banks anymore. The MAS is trying to build a system where trust is the most important. It will be interesting to see the results of this crackdown.

After a sharp decline and waning investor confidence, whales are now accumulating billions in SHIB, reigniting short-term price and market optimism. Despite Shiba Inu’s prolonged consolidation, a sudden spike in on-chain activity has caught the market by surprise. For instance, Shiba Inu’s transaction volume soared to 24 trillion SHIB in early June, with whale activity surging 600%. This striking on-chain spike may be the reason why bullish momentum is starting to build, given that SHIB has already enjoyed a 4.3% increase over the past 24 hours, trading at $0.00001182. SHIB’s Golden Cross Pops Up According to market analyst Kryll, Shiba Inu is witnessing a golden cross amid intensified whale accumulation. Why is this bullish? Well, a golden cross happens when the 50-day moving average (MA) crosses above the 200-day one, signalling a potential trend reversal from bearish to bullish. Therefore, Shiba Inu’s short-term price momentum is gaining strength, which has the potential to boost sentiment through positive market psychology. Technical analyst Tom Tucker added , “SHIB is trading just above its YTD low, with a double-bottom pattern forming. Exchange supply is dropping, futures open interest is rising, and a BTC rally could add fuel.” Source: Tom Tucker Meanwhile, the Shibarium team recently unveiled a major upgrade aimed at boosting decentralization, privacy, and censorship resistance. Soon, rate limits will be enforced on public Remote Procedure Call (RPC) endpoints, marking a key move toward a more secure and resilient Shiba Inu network.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-sees-whale-frenzy-with-10-4-trillion-shib-scooped-up-as-golden-cross-forms/,"SHIB|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|BTC","Cryptocurrency|News|SHIB|SHIBA INU",cryptocompare

The ETF is only behind the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF and the iShares MSCI EAFE ETF. The IBIT Bitcoin ETF holds $76 billion in assets under management (AUM) and generates an estimated $191 million in annual revenue. IBIT Becomes BlackRock’s Third Most Profitable Fund BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF has quickly established itself as the firm’s third-highest revenue-generating fund. The ETF has $76 billion in assets under management (AUM), and a 0.25% expense ratio, generating $191 million in annual revenue. The ETF’s stunning growth puts it behind only BlackRock’s iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF and the iShares MSCI EAFE ETF. IBIT launched in January, easily crossing early projections thanks to strong demand from institutional and retail investors. The ETF has experienced consistent inflows since then, which have significantly contributed to its annual revenue. Most analysts believe IBIT will surpass its competition in revenue generation. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas stated, “IBIT is now the 3rd highest revenue-generating ETF for BlackRock out of 1,197 funds, and is only $9b away from being #1. Just another insane stat for a 1.5-year-old (literally an infant) ETF.” Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor responded to the milestone, stating that IBIT will soon become BlackRock’s number one revenue-generating ETF. Market watchers also noted that the spot Bitcoin ETF is only $9 billion in assets away from surpassing IWF as BlackRock’s top revenue-generating ETF. A Record-Breaking ETF BlackRock manages over 1,100 ETFs. However, IBIT’s stunning growth has been unlike any other. The ETF’s current revenue is only $20 million lower than IWF and $16 million lower than EFA. Current market conditions and investor sentiment could help IBIT climb higher. BlackRock’s IBIT became the fastest ETF to reach $2 billion in inflows, reaching the milestone just days after its launch. The fund crossed $50 billion within six months, placing it among the fastest-growing ETFs of all time. IBIT has consistently registered inflows from corporate treasuries, hedge funds, and advisors, benefiting from the rising demand for Bitcoin and other digital asset investment products. According to BlackRock, IBIT’s growth signals rising institutional adoption of Bitcoin. IBIT’s trajectory mirrors the early success of gold ETFs and suggests a push towards crypto integration in traditional portfolios. IBIT’s success is largely due to the fact that it gives investors exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of wallets and direct ownership of the asset. It also underscores the growing demand for Bitcoin as a mainstream investment asset. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

SEC filings reveal Pershing Square Capital has allocated 41% of its capital into the small handful of bets, with the largest allocation in Uber. The firm now has about $2.8 billion invested, or 18.5% of its portfolio, in the rideshare giant, holding 30.3 million shares. Uber’s strength lies in its dominant driving platform, fueled by network effects that attract more drivers and riders, alongside its growing profitability and robust cash flow generation. In addition, Pershing now holds an estimated 18,984,772 shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill, representing 9.07% of its portfolio, valued at just over $1 billion. Chipotle’s scalable, health-focused fast-casual model leverages strong brand loyalty and operational efficiency to drive consistent growth, although the company has faced challenges like tariff-related cost pressures and weaker 2025 foot traffic. Lastly, Pershing Square Capital has committed 14% of its portfolio, approximately $1.6 billion, to Google’s parent company Alphabet. The firm holds an estimated 9,048,131 shares at $180.55 each. The big bet is focused on the tech giant’s continued dominance, fueled by cloud computing, artificial intelligence, ad services and YouTube, bolstered by high switching costs and data-driven network effects, although the firm continues to fight ongoing antitrust challenges.

A court document has resurfaced online in which Ripple CTO David Schwartz claims that Satoshi held “enormous amounts of XRP.” This remark was in response to the question, “You also say, ‘we control a lot of XRP’, does that make it different from Bitcoin ?” To this, Schwartz replied that back then, it was hard to know how Bitcoin was distributed. So Satoshi, the creator, probably held a lot of XRP at that time. David Schwartz said Satoshi holds $XRP … LINK TO COURT CASE PDF BELOW https://t.co/NgaHK0tbyE pic.twitter.com/0UH4Sc1QPK — (@XrpHodL_) July 4, 2025 His unexpected answer has sparked renewed speculation, especially with a mention of the year 2017, which added more confusion and curiosity among crypto enthusiasts. X user Tiffany Hayden joked about it, asking, “How many XRP did Satoshi hold? Did you really say this and nobody noticed?” Schwartz responded with a simple, “What was the question?” prompting a wave of amusement and intrigue within the community. However, Satoshi has vanished from the crypto scene between 2010 and 2011, with no signs of wallet activity or XRP involvement since. Also, Schwartz’s claim that Satoshi “probably” held XRP lacks evidence and appears to be a speculation. David Schwartz has often speculated to be behind the mysterious identity of Bitcoin’s creator. However, he has clarified that he only got involved in Bitcoin around 2011. The Bitcoin whitepaper came out in 2008, and the network officially launched in 2009, but no one knows who truly created it. XRP: Satoshi’s Real Vision? Previously, a widely circulated post by John Squire claimed that XRP is the product which comes closes to Satoshi Nakamoto’s main idea. XRP fans argue that it solves many of Bitcoin’s current issues, like high fees, slow speeds, and centralization. [post_titles_links postid=”478887″] Alex Cobb , a well-known community voice also added by suggesting that Satoshi Nakamoto may have had a hand in creating XRP. He quoted Satoshi’s famous last message from April 23, 2011 “I’ve moved on to other things” hinting that XRP, which launched just a year later, could have been part of those “other things.” Could Satoshi Have Helped Create XRP? While there’s no proof, Ripple CTO David Schwartz and others involved in XRP were also early Bitcoin contributors which has sparked more curiosity around the theory. Also, 2009 emails show that Satoshi had praised the original Ripple project, calling it “unique” for spreading trust rather than centralizing it. However, his remarks referred to RipplePay, created in 2004 and not XRP. But many have mistakenly linked his praise to XRP. Some analysts have also pointed to the timing of Satoshi’s exit in 2011 and the start of XRP’s development soon after. With Arthur Britto reappearing online and old BTC wallets moving, speculation is rising, could Bitcoin’s creators have helped shape XRP too?

No, there is no credible evidence or on-chain data to support David Schwartz’s speculative claim that Satoshi Nakamoto held XRP. Satoshi vanished from the crypto scene between 2010 and 2011, and XRP was only launched in 2012, well after Satoshi’s disappearance.

The timing of Satoshi’s exit in 2011 and XRP’s development soon after also fuels theories.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/satoshi-nakamoto-held-enormous-amounts-of-xrp-says-david-schwartz/,"BTC|XRP|LINK|MARKET|ALTCOIN","News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

A major shift in old BTC wallets has the crypto world talking, and once again, Davinci Jeremie has a message! The well-known early adopter, who famously bought Bitcoin at $1, has shared a reminder: “Stacking sats in times of disbelief makes you legend later.” The post came just a day after 80,000 Bitcoin, worth over $8 billion , was moved from wallets that hadn’t been touched since 2011. 80,000 BTC on the Move Yes, you read that right. The transactions were spotted on Friday and quickly sparked debate. Each wallet had been inactive for over a decade before suddenly transferring large sums of Bitcoin. Coinbase’s Conor Grogan suggested these wallets may have been part of a compromised OG stash. Others speculated they could be linked to early figures like Ripple co-founder Arthur Britto or longtime Bitcoin supporter Roger Ver. I think the timing is very interesting. With Ripple applying for bank license, Fedwire, SEC case closing in, etc. There must be something happening. Even folks are thinking could be Britto. I would say watch these sub wallets where the BTC went to and see where they go. — XRP_Liquidity (Larsen/Britto/Escrow/ODL/RLUSD) (@XRPwallets) July 5, 2025 What’s clear is this: the BTC was originally bought for just $80,000. Today, it’s worth over $8 billion. That alone shows how much early conviction in Bitcoin has paid off. Davinci’s Message: Why It Matters Now Jeremie’s tweet is a reminder of what has worked in crypto – buying when others hesitate. His message points to a pattern seen throughout Bitcoin’s 16-year history: those who bought during uncertain times often ended up ahead. “Those who stacked when nobody believed… will live like legends when everybody else regrets,” he wrote. [post_titles_links postid=”478938″] Bitcoin vs Altcoins: Stability Still Wins Earlier this week, Davinci also spoke about Bitcoin’s stability compared to altcoins. He noted that while altcoin traders face high risk and sleepless nights, Bitcoin remains the one asset that offers long-term peace of mind . Bitcoin is a long-term hedge, especially in a world dealing with inflation and uncertainty. Final Take Whether or not the wallet movements were planned or just a coincidence, the timing of Davinci’s message was sharp. Stack sats when it’s quiet, and you may not need to worry when it’s loud.

2025-07-05T11:20:14,"Stablecoin Mania: Why China’s Douyin is Abuzz with Digital Currency Talk","BitcoinWorld Stablecoin Mania: Why China’s Douyin is Abuzz with Digital Currency Talk Imagine a short video about a complex financial instrument topping the trending charts on one of the world’s largest social media platforms. That’s exactly what’s happening in China, where a video titled ‘What is a stablecoin ‘ has exploded on Douyin, the local version of TikTok, garnering over 12 million views. This isn’t just a fleeting moment; it signals a profound curiosity among the general public about the evolving world of digital assets. But why are millions suddenly captivated by the concept of a stablecoin , especially in a region known for its strict stance on cryptocurrencies? What Exactly is a Stablecoin and Why the Buzz on Douyin? At its core, a stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, usually pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar, or sometimes to commodities like gold. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, which can see dramatic price swings, stablecoins aim to offer price stability. This makes them attractive for various purposes, from facilitating transactions to acting as a safe haven during market downturns. The sudden surge in interest on Douyin can be attributed to several factors: Accessibility: Short-form video platforms like Douyin excel at breaking down complex topics into digestible, engaging content. A ‘What is a stablecoin’ video can explain the basics in under a minute, making it accessible to a mass audience who might otherwise find crypto daunting. Curiosity: Despite official restrictions, there’s an inherent curiosity about new financial technologies. People are always looking for ways to understand emerging trends that could impact their lives or the economy. Economic Context: In uncertain economic times, the concept of a ‘stable’ digital asset might naturally pique interest, even if the direct application for the average user isn’t immediately clear. Decoding China’s Crypto Curiosity Amidst Regulations The fact that ‘What is a stablecoin ‘ is trending in China is particularly fascinating given the country’s stringent regulations concerning cryptocurrencies. China has famously cracked down on crypto trading and mining, even launching its own central bank digital currency, the Digital Yuan (e-CNY), as a state-controlled alternative. So, what does this public interest in a private digital asset signify for China crypto ? It’s important to distinguish between outright speculation and genuine educational interest. While direct engagement with private cryptocurrencies for investment might be restricted, the underlying technology and concepts behind them continue to fascinate. The trending video likely serves an educational purpose, demystifying a term that many have heard but few truly understand. This curiosity doesn’t necessarily translate into a desire to defy regulations but rather reflects a global trend of digital literacy. The government’s push for the Digital Yuan also implicitly raises public awareness about digital currency in general. As people become more familiar with the concept of a digital form of money, their natural curiosity extends to other forms of digital assets, including stablecoins. Global Cryptocurrency Trends: Is China Leading the Way in Public Education? The Douyin phenomenon isn’t an isolated incident; it’s a reflection of broader cryptocurrency trends worldwide. Across the globe, we’re seeing an increasing demand for clear, simple explanations of crypto concepts. Social media platforms, from TikTok to YouTube, have become unlikely educators, filling a gap that traditional financial institutions often struggle to address. This massive viewership in China suggests a significant underlying demand for crypto knowledge, even in markets with tight controls. It highlights that: Information travels: Despite firewalls, interest in global financial innovations persists. Education is key: The public is eager to learn, and simplified content resonates widely. Social media’s power: These platforms are incredibly effective at disseminating information, regardless of the topic’s complexity or sensitivity. Understanding these cryptocurrency trends is vital for anyone operating in the digital asset space, as it points to where future growth and adoption might stem from: informed users. The Future of Digital Currency: Beyond the Headlines The trending stablecoin video on Douyin serves as a powerful indicator of the public’s growing engagement with the concept of digital currency . While China’s specific regulatory environment adds a unique layer to this story, the underlying message is universal: the world is increasingly curious about how digital assets will shape our financial future. Looking ahead, we can anticipate continued discussions and developments around stablecoins and other forms of digital money. The benefits, such as efficient cross-border payments and a hedge against volatility, are compelling. However, challenges like regulatory oversight, potential for centralization, and consumer protection remain critical areas of focus. For the average person, understanding these basic building blocks of the digital economy will become increasingly important, regardless of where they live. The viral success of ‘What is a stablecoin’ on Douyin is more than just a trending video; it’s a fascinating glimpse into the collective consciousness of a nation grappling with the complexities and possibilities of the digital age. It underscores a universal truth: knowledge empowers, and people are hungry for it, especially when it comes to understanding the innovations that are reshaping our world.

2025-07-05T11:10:11,"Bitcoin Purchase: Norwegian Block Exchange Secures Funding for Strategic Digital Asset Investment","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Purchase: Norwegian Block Exchange Secures Funding for Strategic Digital Asset Investment The world of cryptocurrency is abuzz with the latest move from the Norwegian Block Exchange (NBX). This publicly listed digital asset trading platform has announced a significant fundraising effort, securing approximately $535,000, specifically earmarked for a strategic Bitcoin purchase . This isn’t just another transaction; it signals a growing confidence in digital assets among established financial entities. What’s Behind the Norwegian Block Exchange’s Latest Bitcoin Purchase? The Norwegian Block Exchange , a prominent player in the digital asset space, successfully raised NOK 5.4 million, which translates to roughly $535,369. The primary objective of this fundraising was clear: to bolster its balance sheet with Bitcoin (BTC). The company wasted no time, having already acquired six BTC, an investment currently valued at approximately $633,700. This immediate acquisition highlights NBX’s conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value. As a publicly listed entity, NBX’s decision to directly invest in Bitcoin carries significant weight. It demonstrates a proactive approach to treasury management and a belief in the potential of cryptocurrencies to serve as a valuable asset class. Furthermore, the company has expressed intentions to explore using BTC as collateral, a forward-thinking strategy that could unlock new financial opportunities within the digital asset ecosystem. How Does This Crypto Investment Reshape the Landscape for Digital Assets? NBX’s recent crypto investment is more than just a company expanding its holdings; it’s a testament to the increasing mainstream acceptance of digital assets . For years, Bitcoin was viewed with skepticism by traditional finance, often dismissed as too volatile or speculative. However, the tide has turned. Publicly traded companies are now actively integrating Bitcoin into their financial strategies, validating its role as a store of value and a potential hedge against inflation. This move by NBX contributes to a broader narrative of institutional adoption. When a regulated, publicly listed platform like NBX makes such a commitment, it sends a powerful signal to other financial institutions and investors. It suggests that the perceived risks are diminishing, while the potential benefits are becoming too significant to ignore. This could pave the way for: Increased Institutional Interest: More traditional financial players may feel confident exploring crypto investments. Enhanced Liquidity: Greater corporate participation can lead to deeper markets and improved liquidity for digital assets. Regulatory Clarity: As more regulated entities engage with crypto, it often spurs regulators to provide clearer guidelines. Innovation in Financial Products: The exploration of BTC as collateral by NBX could inspire new lending and borrowing products in the crypto space. The Growing Trend: Why More Companies are Making a Corporate Bitcoin Commitment The corporate Bitcoin trend is not new, but it continues to gain momentum. Pioneers like MicroStrategy have famously amassed vast Bitcoin treasuries, citing its potential as a superior store of value compared to fiat currencies, which are susceptible to inflation. Companies are increasingly looking at Bitcoin as a strategic asset for several reasons: Inflation Hedge: In an era of quantitative easing and rising inflation concerns, Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it an attractive alternative to traditional assets. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury can offer diversification away from traditional financial instruments, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Growth Potential: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has demonstrated significant long-term growth potential, offering companies a chance to enhance their balance sheets. Forward-Thinking Image: Embracing Bitcoin can also project a modern, innovative image for a company, appealing to a tech-savvy investor base. While the benefits are compelling, companies also face challenges, including market volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and the need for secure custody solutions. However, NBX’s strategic approach, including the exploration of Bitcoin as collateral, suggests a thoughtful navigation of these complexities. What’s Next for Norwegian Block Exchange and the Future of Digital Assets? The strategic Bitcoin purchase by the Norwegian Block Exchange is a clear indicator of its long-term vision within the rapidly evolving financial landscape. By actively integrating Bitcoin into its operations and exploring innovative uses like collateralization, NBX is positioning itself at the forefront of digital finance. This move could set a precedent for other European and global financial platforms, encouraging them to reassess their stance on cryptocurrency. The continuous growth of the digital assets market relies on such bold steps from regulated entities, fostering trust and stability. Looking ahead, we can anticipate NBX to continue leveraging its Bitcoin holdings, potentially integrating them into new financial products or services for its customers. This pioneering spirit from a publicly listed company underscores the irreversible shift towards a more decentralized and digitally-native financial system. The future of finance is increasingly intertwined with the adoption of cryptocurrencies, and NBX is certainly playing a pivotal role in this transformation. The Norwegian Block Exchange’s decision to raise capital for a significant Bitcoin purchase is a powerful statement about the evolving role of cryptocurrencies in corporate finance. It highlights a growing confidence in Bitcoin as a strategic asset, capable of serving both as a store of value and a versatile tool for future financial innovation. As more institutions follow suit, the lines between traditional finance and the digital asset world will continue to blur, paving the way for a more integrated and dynamic global economy.

2025-07-05T11:07:49,"Is Bitcoin Mining Profitable? Bitcoin Solaris Mobile Mining Revolutionizes Wealth Creation Without Expensive Hardware","The post Is Bitcoin Mining Profitable? Bitcoin Solaris Mobile Mining Revolutionizes Wealth Creation Without Expensive Hardware appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Not long ago, the dream of earning Bitcoin through mining meant setting up a noisy, heat-blasting rig that drained your wallet and your electricity bill. It was a game for early adopters with deep pockets and tech skills. Today, Bitcoin Solaris is proving that you don’t need a warehouse full of GPUs to tap into serious crypto gains. All you need is your phone, some curiosity, and a little timing, because this presale window won’t stay open forever. Why Traditional Bitcoin Mining Left Most People Behind Bitcoin changed the financial world, but let’s be honest, mining it became a high-stakes, resource-heavy battle. Between rising hardware costs and soaring energy consumption, mining profits vanished for everyday users. Sure, it built empires, but it also built walls. Those walls are now coming down. Enter Bitcoin Solaris . Unlike the original Bitcoin, BTC-S was built from the ground up with accessibility, efficiency, and scalability in mind. And its mobile-first approach isn’t just different, it’s a game-changer. The Heart of BTC-S: Mobile Mining for All Bitcoin Solaris is built on a Universal Mining model that lets anyone participate, from hardcore miners to people with mid-range Android phones. Whether you’re working from a laptop in a coffee shop or relaxing with your phone, you can mine BTC-S without breaking a sweat or a fuse box. What makes it even more impressive is the upcoming Solaris Nova App. This isn’t a lightweight gimmick. It’s a powerful tool with serious features: One-click mining with adaptive algorithms for each device Built-in wallet for seamless rewards tracking Energy-saving modes for mobile devices In-app tutorials that make it beginner-friendly Compatible across Android, iOS, PC, Mac, and browser Whether you’re on your laptop or phone, Solaris Nova is setting the standard for what mining should feel like: simple, secure, and smooth. Even the mining community is buzzing. A detailed review by Token Galaxy breaks down exactly why the platform is catching fire. And it’s not just the mining that’s turning heads. Crypto Was Meant for Everyone BTC-S Finally Delivers That Promise Beyond Just Mining: A Scalable, Efficient Blockchain Core The mobile mining narrative is strong, but the tech under the hood makes BTC-S far more than a mining story. Its architecture delivers blazing performance with real-world utility. Dual-layer design with a hybrid PoW + DPoS consensus model 10,000+ transactions per second and 2-second finality 99.95% lower energy consumption compared to traditional Bitcoin mining Validator rotation for secure, decentralized governance This tech isn’t theoretical. It’s already been validated through successful audits by both Cyberscope and Freshcoins , ensuring that the platform is both trustworthy and scalable. And if you want to see how much you could potentially mine, check out the official calculator . It’s a glimpse at what crypto earnings can look like without the tech headache. Why the Presale Is Booming with 150% Launch Potential There’s a reason over 13,650 unique users have already joined. The presale isn’t just hot, it’s historic. With less than 4 weeks left, this is one of the shortest and most explosive fundraising rounds in recent memory. Current presale price: $10 Next phase price: $11 Launch price: $20 Bonus: 6% Estimated gain: 150% at launch Solaris has already raised over $6 million, and momentum isn’t slowing. And wallets like Trust Wallet and Metamask are recommended for seamless token delivery after launch. That’s right, you don’t need them to buy in, just to receive your tokens when the fireworks start. This is more than hype. It’s an opportunity with real infrastructure behind it. Even on social platforms like Telegram and X , communities are growing fast and spreading the word. Tokenomics: Built to Last At the core of long-term value is the BTC-S token structure, and it’s clear this project was built with sustainability in mind. According to the official tokenomics , here’s how BTC-S is distributed: 66.66% allocated to mining over 90 years 20% reserved for the presale 5% for liquidity pools 2% each for ecosystem, community rewards, marketing, and staking 0.33% for the team and advisors With only 21 million BTC-S tokens ever to exist, scarcity is built in. And by heavily prioritizing mining and public access, the project ensures decentralized, organic growth for years to come. The Verdict: Mining, Simplified. Crypto, Reimagined. Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just asking if mining is still profitable; it’s proving that it can be more inclusive, more powerful, and more rewarding than ever before. With a mobile-first model, clean energy performance, and a global community behind it, BTC-S delivers on the vision that made Bitcoin a revolution in the first place. But this time, you don’t need a warehouse full of servers to join the wealth wave. You just need to be early.

2025-07-05T11:00:12,"No Room For Bears: Bitcoin Bullish MACD, Monthly Close Fuel Bullish Outlook","Bitcoin is facing resistance just below its $112,000 all-time high, struggling to break into price discovery as the market gains momentum. After reaching a high of $110,500 yesterday, BTC has retraced over 2%, but price action remains bullish. Traders are closely watching this consolidation, which may act as a springboard for a decisive move upward. Related Reading: Ethereum Forms Rising Wedge Pattern – $2,200 Support Back In Focus? According to top analyst Ted Pillows, multiple technical indicators support a bullish outlook. Notably, Bitcoin has just confirmed a bullish MACD crossover on the daily timeframe, which is often a precursor to upside continuation. Adding to the bullish case is Bitcoin’s highest monthly close in history, a key psychological milestone that could bring new inflows and spark renewed interest from sidelined investors. The current setup points to a market that’s primed for upside, provided buyers can reclaim the $112K level. As macroeconomic uncertainty fades and bullish momentum builds across the crypto space, Bitcoin could soon enter uncharted territory. All eyes are on the next few sessions as BTC tests critical levels with strong technical backing. Bitcoin Nears Crucial Breakout Phase Amid Bullish Momentum Bitcoin has gained over 10% since June 22, climbing from local lows near $98,000 to current levels around $108,000. This steady advance reflects renewed optimism across the crypto market, but the asset now enters a critical phase. Price action has stalled just below the $112,000 all-time high—a resistance level that has capped Bitcoin’s upside since late May. The coming days will be decisive, as a breakout above this level could trigger price discovery, while a rejection may open the door for a broader pullback. Despite the short-term uncertainty, the long-term outlook remains firmly bullish. Many analysts argue that an eventual move beyond $112K is inevitable, driven by favorable macro trends, strong institutional interest, and growing demand for spot ETFs. Still, caution is warranted. A failure to hold current support levels—especially the $105,000–$106,000 zone—could lead to a drop below $100,000 and shake out overleveraged positions. Ted Pillows remains confident, stating, “You can’t be bearish on Bitcoin now.” His view is based on a confluence of technical factors: a confirmed bullish MACD crossover, a clean support retest, and Bitcoin’s highest monthly close on record. These signals, combined with steady momentum, suggest that a new all-time high could be just days away. Related Reading: Chainlink Consolidates Above Key Support – Bulls Eye $20 Range BTC Faces Rejection At $109K, Eyes Key Support At $106K Bitcoin’s price is consolidating after failing to hold above the $109,300 resistance level, as seen on the 4-hour chart. After briefly tapping above $110,000, BTC retraced and is now hovering around $107,961. This rejection suggests that the all-time high zone remains a major obstacle for bulls despite the ongoing uptrend. Price is now testing the 50 SMA (blue line), currently acting as dynamic support, while the 100 and 200 SMAs (green and red) below provide a broader safety net in the $106,000–$106,500 region. The key level to watch remains $109,300. A decisive break and close above this level on strong volume would likely signal the start of price discovery. However, if bears manage to push BTC below $106,000, we could see a retest of the $103,600 support—an area that has held multiple times since late May. Related Reading: Ethereum Looks Strong Despite Volatility – $10,000 Price Target Gains Momentum Volume is relatively low compared to previous impulse moves, indicating that the current pullback may be a healthy pause rather than a trend reversal. For now, Bitcoin’s structure remains bullish, with higher highs and higher lows intact. If bulls can defend this support zone and regain momentum, a new attempt at breaking $112,000 may come sooner rather than later. The next 48–72 hours will be critical.

President Donald Trump has issued a stern warning: if U.S. trading partners don’t finalize new trade agreements by July 9, they could face tariffs of up to 70% on imports starting August 1 . This bold move under Trump’s “America First” policy has already started rattling global markets—and could soon ripple into the crypto space. July 9 Deadline: No Extensions, Says Trump Trump made it clear—no country will get an extra day beyond the July 9 deadline to strike new trade deals. Currently, a temporary 10% tariff is in place for most partners, but failure to strike a deal could raise that figure to as high as 70%. Who Has Secured a Deal So Far? Some countries have already managed to avoid the tariff hike: UK : Reached a deal in May to maintain a 10% tariff with special terms for autos and aircraft engines. Vietnam : Agreed to a 20% export tariff to the U.S., with U.S. goods entering Vietnam duty-free. But others are still negotiating, or worse—on the verge of missing the deadline. Countries at Risk: Japan, South Korea, EU, India Japan and South Korea saw talks break down after initial progress. The EU is internally divided, delaying its potential deal. India is resisting U.S. demands, especially regarding genetically modified crops and agri-market access. With less than a week left, the clock is ticking fast. U.S. Sending Warning Letters to Non-Compliant Countries The U.S. government is reportedly sending official letters to at least 12 nations, detailing the exact tariff rates they will face if no agreement is reached. Countries like South Korea, Indonesia, and the EU are racing to finalize deals before July 9.

What It Means for Crypto: Volatility First, Bullish Later? If new tariffs spark global economic uncertainty, risk assets like crypto may initially dip. But in the medium to long term, crypto could benefit: Bitcoin and stablecoins may become hedges against inflation. Investors might shift to crypto as fiat currencies come under pressure. Market instability often leads to increased crypto adoption . While Trump’s tariff threat may jolt markets in the short term, it could fuel crypto’s growth as a decentralized alternative to traditional finance. [article_inside_subscriber_shortcode title=”Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!” description=”Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more.” category_name=”News” category_id=”6″] FAQs What is the likelihood of a global trade war, and how would it impact the global economy? The likelihood of a global trade war is heightened by Trump’s ultimatum. If tariffs escalate, it could lead to reduced global trade volumes, increased costs for consumers and businesses, and slower economic growth worldwide. Such a scenario disrupts supply chains, can fuel inflation, and might shift global alliances, potentially reducing global GDP. How will the tariffs impact cryptocurrency prices in the short and long term? In the short term, tariffs are likely to cause market volatility and uncertainty, leading investors to pull back from perceived high-risk assets like cryptocurrencies, potentially causing price dips. However, in the medium to long term, if trade wars lead to inflation or currency devaluation, crypto (especially Bitcoin) could be seen as a hedge, attracting investors and potentially driving adoption and price appreciation. What role does Trump’s pro-crypto stance play in mitigating tariff-related crypto market volatility? Despite Trump’s pro-crypto stance, which includes appointing crypto-friendly regulators and establishing a U.S. Bitcoin reserve, tariffs can still cause crypto market volatility. While his policies aim to legitimize and boost crypto, the immediate economic uncertainty from trade disputes often outweighs this, leading to short-term price drops as investors become risk-averse.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/how-the-crypto-market-will-react-to-trumps-70-tariff-warning/,"MARKET|ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-07-05T10:50:05,"El Salvador’s Bold Bitcoin Accumulation: A Strategic Boost to National BTC Holdings","BitcoinWorld El Salvador’s Bold Bitcoin Accumulation: A Strategic Boost to National BTC Holdings In a world where nations are still grappling with the concept of digital assets, El Salvador continues to stand out as a pioneering force. The Central American nation, under the visionary leadership of President Nayib Bukele, has once again made headlines with its latest Bitcoin accumulation , solidifying its commitment to a unique economic path. This recent acquisition isn’t just a number; it’s a testament to a bold crypto strategy that is reshaping the global perception of sovereign digital asset reserves and positioning El Salvador Bitcoin initiatives at the forefront of financial innovation. El Salvador Bitcoin: A Steadfast Commitment to Digital Assets The news broke from the National Bitcoin Office (ONBTC): El Salvador has added another eight Bitcoin (BTC) to its coffers over the past week. This seemingly small increment pushes the nation’s total BTC holdings to an impressive 6,228.18 BTC, now valued at approximately $674 million. This consistent, strategic accumulation underscores El Salvador’s long-term belief in Bitcoin as a foundational element of its financial future. What does this steady growth signify for a nation that adopted Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021? The implications are significant, pointing towards a deep-seated conviction in the long-term value and utility of digital currency. Consistent Growth: Unlike speculative trading, El Salvador’s approach appears to be one of steady accumulation, often buying the dip, which demonstrates a disciplined investment philosophy. Transparency: The ONBTC regularly updates the public on the nation’s holdings, fostering trust and providing a clear picture of its digital treasury, a move often praised by crypto advocates. Strategic Vision: Each acquisition reinforces the government’s conviction that Bitcoin offers a path to economic independence and financial inclusion, aiming to bypass traditional financial hurdles. This ongoing commitment to El Salvador Bitcoin initiatives highlights a unique economic experiment unfolding before our eyes. It’s not merely about holding a digital asset; it’s about integrating it into the very fabric of the national economy, from tourism to remittances, creating a new economic paradigm. Understanding El Salvador’s Bitcoin Accumulation Strategy How does a nation go about accumulating such significant BTC holdings ? El Salvador’s strategy has been multifaceted since it became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. Beyond direct purchases, the nation has utilized various revenue streams related to its Bitcoin initiatives. For instance, profits from its state-run Bitcoin wallet, Chivo, and even Bitcoin generated from its volcanic geothermal energy projects, contribute to the national treasury’s digital reserves. This diversified approach to Bitcoin accumulation showcases a thoughtful, if unconventional, economic model designed to maximize their digital assets. President Bukele himself has often taken to social media to announce significant purchases, often coinciding with market dips, demonstrating a ‘buy the dip’ philosophy. This active management of their Bitcoin accumulation strategy has allowed El Salvador to grow its reserves steadily, turning market volatility into opportunities for growth. It’s a high-stakes game, certainly, but one that El Salvador seems committed to playing for the long haul, aiming to leverage Bitcoin’s potential for national prosperity. The National Bitcoin Office: Guardians of El Salvador’s Crypto Future The role of the National Bitcoin Office (ONBTC) cannot be overstated in El Salvador’s crypto journey. Established to manage, monitor, and promote the country’s Bitcoin initiatives, the ONBTC acts as the central hub for all things related to the nation’s digital asset strategy. Their recent announcement of the updated BTC holdings is just one example of their commitment to transparency and public communication. The ONBTC’s responsibilities are extensive and crucial for the successful implementation of the national crypto strategy : Overseeing the national Bitcoin treasury and ensuring secure storage of the nation’s digital wealth. Promoting Bitcoin education and adoption among citizens, bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralized currencies. Developing policies and regulations for the responsible use of Bitcoin, creating a stable legal framework for its integration. Collaborating with international entities on digital asset matters, fostering global understanding and cooperation. This dedicated institution ensures that El Salvador’s bold crypto strategy is executed with diligence and accountability, providing a structured approach to integrating Bitcoin into the national economy and setting a precedent for other nations to potentially follow. What Do El Salvador’s BTC Holdings Mean for Its Economy? With its BTC holdings now valued at nearly $674 million, the question naturally arises: what does this mean for El Salvador’s economy? While a significant sum, it’s important to view this within the context of the nation’s overall economic landscape. However, the symbolic and potential long-term benefits are substantial. Bitcoin, as legal tender, aims to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar, attract foreign investment, boost tourism, and provide financial services to the unbanked population. The nation’s continued Bitcoin accumulation strategy reinforces these goals, painting a picture of a future less dependent on traditional financial systems. The vision is that as Bitcoin’s value potentially increases over time, so too will El Salvador’s national wealth, which could then be reinvested into public services and infrastructure. This innovative crypto strategy is a gamble, certainly, but one with the potential for transformative rewards. It’s a bet on the future of decentralized finance and a testament to the nation’s desire for financial sovereignty, aiming to unlock new avenues for economic growth and development. Challenges and the Future of El Salvador’s Crypto Strategy While the headlines often focus on the accumulation, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges inherent in El Salvador’s pioneering crypto strategy . Volatility in the Bitcoin market means the value of their BTC holdings can fluctuate significantly, posing risks to the national balance sheet. International financial institutions like the IMF have expressed concerns, citing risks to financial stability and consumer protection. Despite these warnings, El Salvador has remained steadfast, indicating a firm belief in their chosen path. Looking ahead, the future of El Salvador Bitcoin initiatives involves continued infrastructure development, such as the proposed “Bitcoin City” powered by geothermal energy, and further integration of Bitcoin into daily life through enhanced accessibility and education. The success of this grand experiment will likely serve as a blueprint, or a cautionary tale, for other nations contemplating similar moves. The world watches closely as El Salvador continues to navigate the uncharted waters of sovereign Bitcoin adoption and its ambitious Bitcoin accumulation , potentially setting a new standard for national economic policy. Conclusion: A Nation Forging Its Own Path El Salvador’s consistent Bitcoin accumulation , culminating in its impressive BTC holdings of over 6,228 BTC, is more than just a financial update; it’s a narrative of national determination and innovation. Underpinned by the diligent work of the National Bitcoin Office and a clear crypto strategy , the nation is carving out a unique position on the global stage. While challenges remain, El Salvador’s unwavering commitment to El Salvador Bitcoin as legal tender and a national asset offers invaluable insights into the potential future of sovereign digital economies. It’s a bold move that continues to spark debate, inspire curiosity, and ultimately, shape the future of finance.

2025-07-05T10:40:03,"Fragbite Group’s Bold Leap: $522K Loan Fuels Bitcoin Treasury Revolution","BitcoinWorld Fragbite Group’s Bold Leap: $522K Loan Fuels Bitcoin Treasury Revolution In a compelling move that underscores the evolving landscape of corporate finance, Swedish esports powerhouse Fragbite Group has made headlines by securing a substantial loan to establish a dedicated Bitcoin treasury unit. This isn’t just about a company getting a loan; it’s a powerful statement about growing confidence in digital assets and a strategic shift towards leveraging Bitcoin for long-term financial stability and growth. Fragbite Group’s Strategic Dive into Bitcoin The news, reported by MarketScreener, reveals that Fragbite Group has obtained a SEK 5 million, interest-free loan, equivalent to approximately $522,854. This significant capital injection is specifically earmarked to support the rollout of its ambitious new Bitcoin (BTC) Treasury division. What makes this even more intriguing is the source of the loan: a group of shareholders, including three key company insiders – Treasury Director Patrik von Bahr and board members Mikael A. Pettersson and Niclas Bergkvist. The terms of the loan allow for its conversion into shares at a rate of SEK 10 (about $1) per share, pending approval by a supermajority at an extraordinary general meeting. This structure indicates a deep-seated belief from within the company’s leadership in the potential of this strategic direction. CEO Stefan Tengvall articulated the firm’s vision, stating that the swift completion of this deal reflects strong investor confidence in Fragbite Group’s commitment to utilize BTC. The goal is clear: to strengthen the company’s capital structure and drive long-term shareholder value. This decision positions Fragbite Group not just as an esports entity, but as a forward-thinking player in the realm of corporate finance, embracing innovative strategies for wealth preservation and growth. Understanding the “Why”: The Allure of a Bitcoin Treasury So, why are companies like Fragbite Group increasingly turning to a Bitcoin treasury ? For decades, corporate treasuries primarily focused on managing cash, short-term investments, and liquidity, aiming for safety and modest returns. However, the current economic climate, characterized by inflation concerns and low interest rates, has prompted a re-evaluation of traditional strategies. A Bitcoin treasury involves holding a portion of a company’s reserves in Bitcoin, treating it as a strategic asset rather than just a speculative investment. Key reasons for this shift include: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins makes it a potential hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies due to inflation. Store of Value: Proponents view Bitcoin as “digital gold,” a scarce asset that can preserve purchasing power over time. Balance Sheet Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a treasury diversifies a company’s asset holdings, reducing reliance on traditional assets that may be susceptible to specific economic pressures. Potential for Appreciation: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has shown significant long-term growth potential, offering an opportunity for substantial returns on capital. Innovation and Forward-Thinking Image: Embracing Bitcoin can signal a company’s commitment to innovation and understanding of emerging financial technologies, appealing to a tech-savvy investor base. For Fragbite Group, a company operating in the cutting-edge esports sector, adopting Bitcoin aligns perfectly with its innovative identity and audience demographics. The Growing Wave of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Fragbite Group is certainly not the first to venture into the realm of corporate Bitcoin adoption . Over the past few years, a growing number of public and private companies have allocated portions of their balance sheets to Bitcoin, setting a precedent for others to follow. The most prominent example is MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, which has accumulated billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin, making it a pioneer in this space. Other notable companies include: Tesla: The electric vehicle giant briefly held a significant amount of Bitcoin on its balance sheet and accepted it for payments, though its stance has evolved. Block (formerly Square): Jack Dorsey’s payments company has also made substantial Bitcoin purchases, viewing it as a tool for economic empowerment. Marathon Digital Holdings: A leading Bitcoin mining company, which naturally holds a significant amount of BTC. These early adopters have demonstrated varying levels of success and commitment, but their actions have collectively legitimized Bitcoin as a viable treasury asset for mainstream corporations. Fragbite Group’s move adds another layer to this narrative, particularly from a sector like esports, which often sits at the intersection of technology and entertainment. Esports Meets Digital Assets: A Natural Synergy? The intersection of esports Bitcoin adoption makes perfect sense. The esports industry is inherently digital, global, and technologically forward-thinking. Its audience is largely composed of digital natives who are often early adopters of new technologies, including cryptocurrencies and blockchain. This demographic familiarity with digital assets can translate into several advantages for an esports company like Fragbite Group: Audience Alignment: Holding Bitcoin resonates with a tech-savvy and crypto-aware audience, potentially enhancing brand loyalty and appeal. Future Integration: A deeper understanding and direct involvement with Bitcoin could pave the way for future integrations within the esports ecosystem, such as blockchain-based gaming, NFTs for fan engagement, or even crypto-based prize pools and payments. Global Reach: Esports is a global phenomenon, and Bitcoin, as a borderless currency, aligns well with the industry’s international nature, potentially simplifying cross-border transactions and operations in the future. By establishing a Bitcoin treasury, Fragbite Group is not just making a financial decision; it’s also making a strategic brand statement that aligns with the future trajectory of the digital entertainment industry. Navigating the Challenges of Digital Assets While the benefits are compelling, integrating digital assets like Bitcoin into a corporate treasury is not without its challenges. Companies must carefully consider and mitigate various risks: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can be highly volatile, leading to significant fluctuations in the value of a company’s holdings. This requires a long-term investment horizon and a high tolerance for risk. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Changes in regulations could impact the legality, taxation, or operational aspects of holding digital assets. Custody and Security: Storing Bitcoin securely requires specialized knowledge and robust cybersecurity measures to prevent hacks or loss of funds. Companies must choose reliable custody solutions. Accounting and Taxation: The accounting treatment of Bitcoin can be complex, varying by jurisdiction. Companies need clear guidance on how to report these assets on their balance sheets and handle tax implications. Fragbite Group’s decision to use an interest-free, convertible loan from insiders suggests a well-thought-out approach to managing initial capital and risk, demonstrating confidence from those closest to the company’s operations and vision. Fragbite’s Bold Move: A Blueprint for Others? Fragbite Group’s innovative financing structure for its Bitcoin treasury unit is particularly noteworthy. An interest-free loan from shareholders, convertible into shares, aligns the interests of the capital providers directly with the long-term success of the Bitcoin treasury initiative and the company as a whole. This mechanism minimizes immediate financial strain while providing a clear pathway for investors to participate in the company’s growth, should the Bitcoin strategy prove successful. CEO Stefan Tengvall’s emphasis on investor confidence and the swift completion of the deal highlights the internal belief in this strategic direction. This move could serve as a blueprint for other companies, especially those in the tech and gaming sectors, looking to explore similar avenues for balance sheet diversification and value creation without incurring immediate debt service costs or diluting existing equity unnecessarily. The successful execution and future performance of Fragbite Group’s Bitcoin treasury unit will undoubtedly be watched closely by other corporate entities contemplating their own foray into digital asset management. Actionable Insights for Investors and Businesses For investors, Fragbite Group’s move signals a company willing to innovate and embrace new financial paradigms. When evaluating companies, consider: Strategic Rationale: Does the company have a clear, well-articulated reason for holding Bitcoin? Risk Management: How are they addressing volatility, security, and regulatory risks? Transparency: Is there clear reporting on their digital asset holdings and strategy? Leadership Vision: Is the leadership committed to and knowledgeable about digital assets? For businesses considering a similar path: Start Small: Begin with a manageable allocation to test the waters and gain experience. Educate Your Team: Ensure your finance, legal, and IT teams understand the nuances of digital assets. Seek Expert Advice: Consult with legal, tax, and custody experts specializing in cryptocurrencies. Long-Term View: Adopt a long-term investment horizon to ride out market volatility. The Future of Corporate Finance: Is Bitcoin the New Gold? Fragbite Group’s venture into a Bitcoin treasury unit is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a testament to the evolving role of cryptocurrencies in mainstream corporate finance. As inflation concerns persist and the digital economy expands, more companies are likely to explore alternative assets like Bitcoin to protect and grow their capital. While challenges remain, the trend towards corporate Bitcoin adoption is gaining momentum, pushing the boundaries of traditional treasury management. Fragbite Group, an esports innovator, is now also a pioneer in this financial frontier, demonstrating that strategic foresight in the digital age extends beyond product development to encompass a company’s very financial foundation. Fragbite Group’s decision to establish a Bitcoin treasury unit marks a significant milestone, showcasing a forward-thinking approach to corporate finance within the dynamic esports industry. By leveraging an innovative loan structure and demonstrating strong internal confidence, the company aims to bolster its capital structure and enhance shareholder value. This move not only highlights the increasing legitimization of Bitcoin as a corporate asset but also signals a potential blueprint for other businesses seeking to diversify their balance sheets and embrace the future of digital finance. As the lines between traditional finance and the crypto world continue to blur, Fragbite Group stands out as an early adopter charting a new course for corporate treasury management in the digital age.

However, along with support, the discussion has sparked some debate as well. While some US crypto experts are drawing a blueprint for crypto development, others are sharing contrasting views. Debate on Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in the US Lyn Alden, a well-known crypto advocate and financial analyst, stood against nationalizing companies to build a strategic Bitcoin reserve. She stated that this could result in breaching the property rights in the country. She said in a statement on X , “Nationalizing a company like that is a good way for a country to tell the world that they don’t respect property rights and to think twice about investing in the country for the next couple of decades.” While Alden opposed the approach, citing concerns for investors’ funds, other crypto experts shared different perspectives. Crypto Advocates in Favor of Nationalizing Companies for Bitcoin Reserve Willy Woo , who is renowned for his unique insights on crypto, created a playbook for the US bitcoin reserve detailing all the required efforts and approaches. His idea was acknowledged by Max Keiser , an American filmmaker and bitcoin advocate, who said, “Willy’s view is worth considering.” Keiser also indicated that if Russia and China implement this proposal, they could acquire 1 million bitcoin, which will potentially lead to a hash war. He also stated that such a move will push the US to seize private firms like MicroStrategy, Riot Blockchain for national security. [post_titles_links postid=”478878″] Does the US Hold the Potential for Nationalizing Companies for a Bitcoin Reserve? In 2025, the US implemented a series of laws and regulations to evolve cryptocurrency and digital assets in the country as it aspires to become the global ‘crypto capital.’ With new blockchain developments, innovative crypto regulations, and President Trump’s support, it is possible for the US to nationalize companies for a bitcoin strategic reserve in the near future. Final Thought After March 6, when Trump signed an executive order to establish a bitcoin reserve , it became a global trend. While the approach of nationalizing companies for cryptocurrency has gained massive support from US representatives, many investors are fearing to invest in those companies.

Nationalizing companies for a Bitcoin reserve could have mixed effects. Proponents argue it could strengthen the US balance sheet, help pay down national debt, hedge against inflation, and boost the legitimacy of crypto. However, critics like Lyn Alden warn it could violate property rights, deter foreign investment, increase taxpayer risk if Bitcoin’s value crashes, and potentially lead to government manipulation of the crypto market, contradicting Bitcoin’s decentralized ethos. How does the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve compare to similar efforts in other countries? The U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, established by Executive Order on March 6, 2025, primarily involves holding forfeited Bitcoin as a long-term reserve and not selling it. This differs from countries like El Salvador, which adopted Bitcoin as legal tender and actively purchased it, or Bhutan, which accumulated reserves through state-owned mining. Other nations like China, the UK, and Ukraine also hold significant Bitcoin, largely from seizures.

The Bollinger Bands indicate a potential range, with the lower bound at $132, suggesting a potential low of $130.

Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High July $130 $150 $165 Solana Price Prediction 2025 As per CoinGlass , Solana leads the crypto derivatives market with a massive $6.14 billion in open interest, far outpacing all other tokens. This indicates strong trader confidence and sustained capital inflow into SOL positions. Other notable projects like FARTCOIN, LINK, and UNI trail behind with open interest between $460M–$540M.

Predictions suggest XRP could reach $5.05 by the end of 2025. Long-term projections show XRP could hit $26.50 by 2030 and $526 by 2050. XRP, one of the top five crypto assets known for its role in cross-border payments, is drawing increased attention as institutional adoption grows and its long-standing legal battle nears a conclusion. Since President Trump took office, Ripple XRP has gained significant traction, fueled by rising on-chain activity, bullish market sentiment, and increasing speculation around a potential XRP ETF Approval in 2025. With these developments in play, XRP price prediction is becoming a major focus for investors. Can XRP reach $100? Is a $500 target realistic in the long term? This article dives deep into XRP price prediction for 2025 and beyond through 2030.

In Q2, after testing the upper boundary of a multi-month descending wedge at $2.65 in mid-May, it fell to hold above a key swing low support at $2.10. The upside potential has been limited due to worsening geopolitical conditions. Many anticipated a catalyst on June 16th with a favorable lawsuit update, but it resulted in a 60-day pause in appeals. On June 17th, the SEC delayed Franklin Templeton’s XRP spot ETF amid geopolitical tensions. The U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites during the third weekend of June shook market sentiment completely XRP dipping to $1.94, but a ceasefire in the fourth week helped the market rebound. On June 23rd onwards, XRP climbed from $1.94, rising over 15% after the ceasefire announcement, turning it into a short-term battle. The fourth week was full of bullish developments, as Ripple’s CEO announced on June 28th that they would drop the cross-appeal against the SEC . Experts now expect, if the SEC also drops its appeal, it would formally conclude a four-year conflict. Investor sentiment has improved, showing less panic in short-term among traders. A strong “buy-the-dip” mentality has emerged amid the chaos. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, called Ripple’s recent decision a turning point, increasing the odds for XRP ETF approval, with BlackRock potentially entering soon . The sentiment has changed, and with market-wide optimism in early July, as the short-term EMA is breached and the XRP price is inching closer to retest the falling channel’s upper border aligned with a supply block near the key $2.40 resistance. This time, a break of the upper border could trigger a rally toward $2.80 in the short term, with a chance to retest the all-time high of $3.40 later in July. The first week of July’s momentum is backed by growing whale transaction count (>100K USD), rising exchange outflow, and spiked spot volume. It indicates a sustained short-term rally. In case, if no strong catalyst emerges to push beyond the pattern’s upper border and the $2.40 supply block, a flash crash could occur, pushing XRP’s price down. If selling pressure were to resume the $2.10 support, which aligns with the 200-day EMA is crucial, as losing grip at this mark could decline to $1.88 or even $1.63. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High June 2025 $1.7 $2.45 $3.40 XRP Price Prediction 2025 If XRP successfully breaks its all-time high of $3.40 in May 2025—a major supply zone on the chart—it could realistically target $5 by year-end, fueled by growing optimism from banks , institutions, and potential ETF support. Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD , is now integrated into its cross-border payments system, Ripple Payments, further strengthening its position in global finance. Moreover, XRP has partnered with Wormhole to utilize its phenomenal cross-chain interoperability. Through this road in development, they seek a real-world adoption to boost. Therefore, consistent developments and crucial partnerships, If XRP manages to break above its all-time high of $3.40 in July 2025, after clearing the high-volume resistance zone at $2.40. Then odds are high that it could realistically target $5 by year-end. This potential rally would likely be fueled by growing optimism from banks, institutional investors, and the possibility of ETF approval. Adding to the bullish case, Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, is now integrated into its Ripple Payments system too, further solidifying its role in global finance. Notably, institutional dominance is evident, with the top 100 addresses holding 70% of the circulating supply, positioning XRP as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap at $138 billion.

Long-term forecasts estimate BTC prices could hit $900K by 2030. The Bitcoin price prediction for 2025 is turning increasingly bullish. This surge in optimism is driven by record-breaking inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs , rising institutional interest , and strong political support, including Trump’s plan to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . With companies like GameStop and Trump Media adding BTC to their balance sheets, and the Fed signaling potential rate cuts, investors are asking one critical question: Will Bitcoin go back up and lead the next financial revolution? What is the Bitcoin price prediction for today? The BTC price may range between $107,296.38 and $109,142.23 today.

Hence, we expect the BTC price to create a 2025 high of ~$168,000. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $71,827.81 $119,713.02 $167,598.22 Bitcoin Price Prediction July 2025 Bitcoin’s performance in Q1 2025 was notably lackluster due to tariff-related concerns alongside the rise in tension between Russia and Ukraine. Yet, it made a remarkable comeback in Q2, particularly during April and May. Driven by easing tensions, Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high of $112,000 by the third week of May. But, In early June, BTC attempted to hold support near the previous swing low from May after pulling back from its $112K peak. On June 6th, a positive U.S. jobs report and renewed U.S.-China trade talks sparked a brief bounce from the dynamic support of the 50-day EMA. Yet, by June 10th, the momentum began to wane, with increased selling pressure linked to rising geopolitical tensions, particularly between Israel and Iran. The situation escalated on June 17th when President Donald Trump issued a warning to Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei. Following a defiant response from Iran, the U.S. launched attacks on Iranian nuclear sites over the third weekend of June, further worsening the geopolitical landscape. Consequently, Bitcoin briefly dipped to around $98,000 but rebounded after a ceasefire announcement on June 23rd. As of the fourth week of June, Bitcoin’s price has advanced significantly, yet it struggles near a multi-month supply block. The price action throughout June had resembled a continuation pattern known as “flag pattern”, with the upper border aligning with this supply block. In the first week of July, daily active addresses, whale transactions count (>1m USD), and addresses holding coins (10,000 – 100,000) have seen increases, as a result, the border of the flag is breached on the upside. Now, if Bitcoin can break through June’s swing high of $110K then this time the chances of surpassing $112,000 become more likely. A successful breakout could propel BTC towards a new high of $120,000 by the end of July. Conversely, if bearish pressure mounts and the price reverses, then the consolidation under the flag would continue and could return to the critical May swing low support zone. Should this level also fail, then Bitcoin could fall to the flag’s lower border, dragging the price down to the $100,000 to $95,000 range in the near term. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High June 2025 $95,000 $103,500 – $108,000 $120,000 Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 Recent insights from Santiment highlight that the Israel-Palestine conflict in H2 2024 caused a spike in social volume. Initially, crypto prices dropped, but the market rebounded, leaving panic sellers behind. A similar trend occurred in Q2 2025 when rising Ukraine-Russia tensions led to increased social activity. After a price dip, Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high of $112,000. Now, the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict has prompted U.S. intervention, resulting in another surge in social volume. Bitcoin’s price dipped to $98,000, but analysts expect a strong rally in H2 2025. Despite geopolitical challenges in Q1 and Q2, the overall outlook for Bitcoin remains bullish. Source: santiment Looking ahead, advancements in financial products, especially ETF flows, could sustain Bitcoin’s bullish momentum. Market sentiment is optimistic, suggesting Bitcoin may reach new highs. Moreover, the speculation is growing that the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates in the U.S., further supporting Bitcoin’s upward movement. Also, pata data is evident of its relationship with global liquidity, as global M2 increases, Bitcoin often experiences price surges. Similarly, the CryptoQuant data also indicates rising accumulation, with exchange reserves declining to 2.4 million BTC, down from 3.1 million BTC a year ago. Ultimately, Bitcoin’s future market potential will depend on buying demand, geopolitical developments, regulatory changes, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Talking about Bitcoin Price Prediction, if things turn bullish, BTC is expected to create a high of $175K. If things go south, we can expect a low of $70K.

2025-07-05T10:00:49,"XRP Price Eyes 70% Surge To $3.99 As Amid Trendline Test","With the market on another come-up, the XRP price looks to be aiming for higher targets from here. While the altcoin has been unable to clear new all-time highs in the last seven years, the current trajectory suggests that this target may be around the corner. Presently, the XRP price is looking to test a major trendline , and if it is able to successfully break through, then high double-digit gains await the cryptocurrency. XRP Price Testing New Trendline A crypto analyst on the TradingView website has pointed out a major development on the XRP price chart that could lead to another surge. This time around, it is the test of a descending trendline which began last year and could be the defining factor from here. The descending trendline, according to the analyst’s chart, begins from the January 2025 price surge that had put the price above $3.3 again. Since then, it has steadily descended as the XRP price has put in lower highs over the next five months. This has led to a culmination at the current level just above $2.2, where the bulls must now make their stand or risk losing control over the digital asset. The crypto analyst explains that this level above $2.2 is the current resistance that had originated from the mid-January highs, and a breakout is important to show signs of buyers taking control. If bullish momentum is renewed as a result of a clean break above this resistance level, then the analyst believes that it could be a strong entry opportunity. In the event of a successful break, the analyst sees the XRP price rising by over 70% from here. This would mean new all-time highs above its current $3.8 peak , as a 70% rise would put the price above $3.9. If the market remains on the bullish path, then this could happen in the next few months. Ripple Developments Propel Price In addition to the technical indicators pointing toward renewed bullishness for the XRP price , there have been other developments that continue to fuel optimism. The Ripple vs. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) legal battle is expected to come to an end as both parties move to withdraw their appeals. Furthermore, Ripple recently made headlines after it filed for a United States National Banking license , in a bid to increase oversight for its RLUSD stablecoin. This move is in a bid to facilitate faster transaction settlements, which a charter license would allow the crypto firm to do, joining the likes of Circle in this bid. The initial response to CEO Brad Garlinghouse announcing this move was a sharp 5% move by the XRP price. And the altcoin is expected to move even faster if this license is granted. Such developments would play a big role in getting the XRP price to new all-time highs.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-price-eyes-70-surge-3-99/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","XRP|crypto|crypto news|ripple|ripple news|Ripple price|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT",cryptocompare
2025-07-05T10:00:15,"Analyst Warns Bitcoin Treasury Trend May Lose Steam","The strategy of holding Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset may not be as sustainable as many expect, warns Glassnode lead analyst James Check. In a post on X on Friday, Check shared concerns that the easy gains for companies entering the Bitcoin treasury space might already be in the past. “My instinct is the Bitcoin treasury strategy has a far shorter lifespan than most expect,” Check wrote, adding that the approach is not about “a measuring contest” but about whether a company’s product and business model can support long-term Bitcoin accumulation without depending solely on hype. “Nobody Wants the 50th Treasury Company” Check noted that new Bitcoin treasury firms face challenges as investors increasingly favor established players. “Nobody wants the 50th Treasury company,” he said, emphasizing that it will become harder for new firms to sustain a premium in the market unless they bring a unique offering. In the 30 days leading up to Friday, 21 entities added Bitcoin as a reserve asset, according to BitcoinTreasuries data . Yet the gap between leaders and newcomers remains significant. Michael Saylor’s Strategy (MSTR), the largest public Bitcoin treasury, holds 597,325 BTC, while the second-largest, MARA Holdings, holds around 50,000 BTC — roughly one-twelfth as much. Check observed that retail speculators are often drawn to these newer treasury firms, but he cautioned that they do not “have infinite money.” While he remains bullish on Bitcoin’s price, which was trading at $107,990 at publication, he noted that sustaining a treasury strategy is a different challenge than simply betting on price appreciation. “It’s a spectrum,” Check explained, saying that larger players like Strategy have more runway than the 300th company attempting to adopt a Bitcoin treasury model. Consolidation May Follow for Weaker Players The concerns echo comments from Taproot Wizards co-founder Udi Wizardheimer, who argued that some companies enter the Bitcoin treasury space seeking quick profits without fully grasping the long-term implications. “Many of the folks raising just see easy money and have no idea what they’re doing,” Wizardheimer said, adding that weaker players may eventually be acquired by stronger firms as the trend matures. Venture firm Breed also raised concerns, suggesting only a few Bitcoin treasury companies will survive the potential “death spiral” affecting firms that trade close to their net asset value. Similarly, GoMining Institutional’s Fakhul Miah recently warned about “copycat” companies entering the space without safeguards, which could risk damaging Bitcoin’s broader image if these firms fail.

Price prediction suggests potential to reach $2.05 by year-end 2025. Long-term forecasts indicate ADA could hit $10.25 by 2030. The Plomin Hard Fork, which activated in Q1 2025, has significantly enhanced Cardano’s appeal to investors by establishing full decentralized governance. This is seen as a key milestone that aligns with the blockchain’s long-term vision of community-driven decision-making. Despite these advancements, bullish attraction post-Plomin Hard Fork was tempered by market dynamics and challenges, on its price chart. However, in Q2 2025, things seem to have changed , as a variety of optimistic factors surround the altcoin sector, which is benefiting the ADA price. As a result, Cardano price prediction is heating up again in the community. With bullish technical signals, major upgrades, and ETF hopes rising , many are intrigued to know, “Is ADA Price ready for a massive breakout?” Here’s a detailed ADA price prediction for 2025 and beyond, including expert targets up to 2050. Coinpedia’s Cardano Price Prediction 2025 Assuming that Cardano continues to focus on the network’s upcoming updates, we can expect a wider adoption rate.

As a result, ADA price has been showing signs of short-term recovery from the $0.55 support level. With the recent bullish momentum in the crypto sector during the first week of July, ADA price has been uplifted to $0.61 with growing hopes of an ADA ETF. ADA is now inching towards the range’s upper border, and a sustained bullish momentum could lead to higher levels. The key level to watch in July is $0.72. If ADA holds and reclaims this level, a breakout above that range may lead to a rally toward $0.86, and if this resistance is cleared, ADA could aim for $1.10 by July end. However, failure to stay above $0.60 could send ADA back to $0.55, with a deeper decline possible toward $0.40.

Unlike many other blockchains, Cardano gives more control to its users than to any central organization. This is reflected in CoinCarp’s rich list, where the top 100 addresses hold just 22% of the mainnet’s circulating supply, significantly lower than most other altcoins. To break above the $1.10–$1.20 range, strong retail participation will be key. A major catalyst could be the approval of an ADA ETF, expected by year-end, which could attract billions in inflows. If ADA holds above its Q1 2025 high, it has a strong chance of retesting the $2.05 mark before the year ends. Scenario Potential Low Average Price Potential High Without ETF Approval $0.85 $1.10 $1.25 With ETF Approval + Retail Surge $1.20 $1.65 $2.05 Bullish Breakout (with ETF & macro support) $1.50 $2.05 $2.80 Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Price Prediction Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) 2026 2.75 3.00 3.25 2027 4.50 4.75 5.00 2028 5.25 5.50 5.75 2029 6.75 7.25 7.75 2030 9.00 9.75 10.25 This table, based on historical movements, shows ADA prices to reach $10.25 by 2030 based on compounding market cap each year. This table provides a framework for understanding the potential Cardano price movements.
