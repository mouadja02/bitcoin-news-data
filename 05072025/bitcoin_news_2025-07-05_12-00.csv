Price prediction suggests potential to reach $2.05 by year-end 2025. Long-term forecasts indicate ADA could hit $10.25 by 2030. The Plomin Hard Fork, which activated in Q1 2025, has significantly enhanced Cardano’s appeal to investors by establishing full decentralized governance. This is seen as a key milestone that aligns with the blockchain’s long-term vision of community-driven decision-making. Despite these advancements, bullish attraction post-Plomin Hard Fork was tempered by market dynamics and challenges, on its price chart. However, in Q2 2025, things seem to have changed , as a variety of optimistic factors surround the altcoin sector, which is benefiting the ADA price. As a result, Cardano price prediction is heating up again in the community. With bullish technical signals, major upgrades, and ETF hopes rising , many are intrigued to know, “Is ADA Price ready for a massive breakout?” Here’s a detailed ADA price prediction for 2025 and beyond, including expert targets up to 2050. Coinpedia’s Cardano Price Prediction 2025 Assuming that Cardano continues to focus on the network’s upcoming updates, we can expect a wider adoption rate. Even the ETF odds has higher approval rate that could bring large crowd wil multi-billion dollars into the asset, once approved. Therefore, we expect the ADA price to reach $2.05 in 2025.

As a result, ADA price has been showing signs of short-term recovery from the $0.55 support level. With the recent bullish momentum in the crypto sector during the first week of July, ADA price has been uplifted to $0.61 with growing hopes of an ADA ETF. ADA is now inching towards the range’s upper border, and a sustained bullish momentum could lead to higher levels. The key level to watch in July is $0.72. If ADA holds and reclaims this level, a breakout above that range may lead to a rally toward $0.86, and if this resistance is cleared, ADA could aim for $1.10 by July end. However, failure to stay above $0.60 could send ADA back to $0.55, with a deeper decline possible toward $0.40. Price Prediction Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) July 2025 $0.40 $0.74 $1.10 ADA Price Prediction 2025 Source: coincarp Cardano has always prioritized decentralization, and the recent Plomin hard fork has taken it a step further. Unlike many other blockchains, Cardano gives more control to its users than to any central organization. This is reflected in CoinCarp’s rich list, where the top 100 addresses hold just 22% of the mainnet’s circulating supply, significantly lower than most other altcoins. To break above the $1.10–$1.20 range, strong retail participation will be key. A major catalyst could be the approval of an ADA ETF, expected by year-end, which could attract billions in inflows. If ADA holds above its Q1 2025 high, it has a strong chance of retesting the $2.05 mark before the year ends. Scenario Potential Low Average Price Potential High Without ETF Approval $0.85 $1.10 $1.25 With ETF Approval + Retail Surge $1.20 $1.65 $2.05 Bullish Breakout (with ETF & macro support) $1.50 $2.05 $2.80 Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Price Prediction Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) 2026 2.75 3.00 3.25 2027 4.50 4.75 5.00 2028 5.25 5.50 5.75 2029 6.75 7.25 7.75 2030 9.00 9.75 10.25 This table, based on historical movements, shows ADA prices to reach $10.25 by 2030 based on compounding market cap each year.

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction.

Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market.

Recent news/opinions on BTC Bitcoin ETF volume is on a rising trend, recording $102.14 million in daily total net inflows on June 30, marking day 15 of a gigantic inflow streak that now totals $4.73 billion. It also marks the third consecutive month of total net inflows totaling $12.8 billion since April. Bitcoin price prediction July 2025 Bitcoin’s price jumped to $109,000, making Q2 its best quarter since 2020. In the second quarter of 2025 alone, it went up by 31%, showing strong market activity and growing investor trust. This rise is partly because, in the past, Bitcoin has often grown a lot after its “halving” events. Analysts think the current market is following the same pattern, which could mean we’ll see a peak around September 2025. Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $105,000 and be pushed further, at least $113,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $101,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction July 2025 $101,000 $105,000 $113,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491.

Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year. Bitcoin price forecast 2029 Projections for 2029 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629. The price may peak at as much as $255,321, with an average throughout the year expected to be around $200,312.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of the Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K. By the end of June, BTC price reclaimed the $108K level.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-price-prediction/,"REGULATION|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|UNI|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT","Crypto Price Predictions|BTC",cryptocompare
2025-07-05T09:31:10,"Trump's 'Big Beautiful Bill' Could Boost Bitcoin Appeal","President Donald Trump celebrated the passage of his “big, beautiful bill” with a patriotic display at the White House, marking a major legislative win. But while the event focused on military strength and national pride, the bill’s deeper economic changes could have unexpected effects on the crypto world. One key result is growing concern about inflation , as the bill includes large tax cuts and expanded spending. Economists warn this could increase the federal deficit by over $3 trillion, potentially weakening the U.S. dollar. Historically, such conditions often lead investors to seek out alternative assets like Bitcoin , which is seen as a hedge against inflation. At the same time, the bill excludes proposed crypto tax reforms . Lawmakers had pushed for provisions like tax breaks for small Bitcoin transactions and mining operations, but those were left out of the final version. This means that while crypto may gain more attention due to the economic fallout, the regulatory landscape remains the same for now. Despite no direct impact on digital assets, experts believe the broader financial consequences of this bill could drive more people to consider Bitcoin as a safe store of value. As inflation fears rise, crypto might gain new momentum, even without fresh legal support.",coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/trump-bill,"BTC|REGULATION|BUSINESS|MINING","",cryptocompare
2025-07-05T09:31:06,"Crypto Traders on Alert as Sweden Expands Law to Seize Digital Assets","Sweden’s Justice Minister Gunnar Strömmer has ordered local authorities to intensify efforts to seize assets like cryptocurrency, luxury goods, and real estate under a sweeping new law targeting unexplained wealth, even from individuals not directly implicated in crimes. Key Takeaways: Sweden’s new law lets authorities seize assets, including crypto, from anyone unable to prove the legitimacy of their wealth. Over $8.3 million has already been confiscated since November 2024. Concerns are rising among legal experts over potential civil liberties violations. Speaking to Dagens industri on Thursday , Strömmer urged police, tax authorities, and the Swedish Enforcement Authority to prioritize cases likely to result in significant confiscations. The justice minister revealed that more than $8.3 million in assets have been seized since the law took effect in November 2024. “Now it’s time to turn up the pressure even more,” Strömmer said. Sweden’s New Law Lets Authorities Seize Assets Without Proof of Crime The controversial legislation empowers authorities to seize cash, bank assets, and luxury items from individuals unable to prove that their wealth matches their income or offer a legitimate explanation for its origin. Sweden’s government announced when passing the measure that it aimed to crack down on violent crime by disrupting criminal finances. “This means that a person who, for example, has large amounts of cash, sizeable bank assets, or luxury articles may forfeit them if he or she does not have an income that is proportional to the property and cannot otherwise explain where it comes from,” the government stated at the time. Though it’s unclear how much of the $8.3 million seized so far is linked to cryptocurrency, the law has already sparked concerns among legal experts and civil liberties advocates. The Economist reported in December that a woman traveling through Gothenburg-Landvetter Airport had $137,000 and a Rolex watch confiscated, while roughly $1 million in assets were seized during the first week of enforcement. California passed bill to seize your crypto. pic.twitter.com/QxbWzKEsSZ — mrredpillz jokaqarmy (@JOKAQARMY1) June 28, 2025 In April, Swedish MP Rickard Nordin called on the finance minister to consider adopting Bitcoin as a reserve asset, proposing that authorities retain seized BTC rather than liquidate it, similar to a “budget-neutral” approach used by the U.S. The push for a digital asset reserve comes after former U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order in March creating a national crypto reserve, potentially influencing lawmakers abroad to explore similar strategies. Swedish MPs Push to Add Bitcoin to National Reserves In April, two Swedish lawmakers urged Finance Minister Elisabeth Svantesson to consider adding Bitcoin to Sweden’s foreign exchange reserves , highlighting its similarities to gold and potential as a hedge against economic instability. Their proposal includes directly accumulating Bitcoin or adopting a budget-neutral strategy by keeping BTC seized in criminal cases instead of auctioning it. At the core of the Swedish lawmakers’ proposal is the belief that Bitcoin could serve as a digital gold, an asset capable of retaining value in times of economic upheaval. Notably, this method has allowed the US government to quietly build up large amounts of BTC, a move formalized in March when Donald Trump signed an executive order making Bitcoin part of the national reserve framework.

2025-07-05T09:29:00,"Best Cheap Crypto to Invest in and Make Up for Missing Bitcoin, XRP, and Solana Rallies.","Even the most hopeful investors can be humbled by the crypto market. You may have heard the success stories of people who bought Bitcoin (BTC) for $100, XRP for $0.005, or Solana (SOL) for $0.20 and turned little amounts of money into massive amounts. But for those who lost out on those moonshots, the real issue is: What’s next? While the big names still receive a lot of press, savvy investors are now turning to new, undervalued tokens that have significant potential for growth. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is the most important part of this movement. It’s a meme coin that’s gradually becoming the most inexpensive crypto buy of 2025. At just $0.0013 in its current presale stage, LILPEPE is offering early backers the kind of upside that Bitcoin and Solana once did — but with far more community hype and infrastructure from the get-go. Missed BTC, XRP, and SOL? You’re Not Alone Most retail investors didn’t buy Bitcoin in 2010 or 2015. They didn’t buy XRP before the 2017 Ripple hype. Many only heard of Solana after it soared past $100 in the last cycle. By then, the lion’s share of gains had already been made. The beauty of crypto, though, is that it constantly offers new opportunities. While large-cap assets like BTC and ETH may double or triple in the next bull run, micro-cap tokens like LILPEPE can 50x or more from their starting point, especially when built on strong foundations, viral branding, and early utility. Why LILPEPE is the Best Low-Cost Crypto Buy Right Now What separates Little Pepe (LILPEPE) from thousands of other meme coins isn’t just its low entry price. It’s that the project is bringing real utility and innovation to a meme category that’s often dominated by pump-and-dump tokens. Built on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token, LILPEPE is launching its own Layer 2 blockchain exclusively for meme coins. The chain is designed to be bot-resistant, lightning-fast, and virtually free of gas fees, solving major issues that plague new meme coin launches. More impressively, LILPEPE is launching a Meme Launchpad, a platform where new creators can build, mint, and launch their meme tokens directly on the LILPEPE chain. This ecosystem approach transforms LILPEPE from a meme into a decentralized factory of meme innovation. This is not just another frog-themed token. It’s the only meme coin positioning itself to become the infrastructure layer for an entire meme economy. Blazing Through Presale Stages and Raising Millions LILPEPE is currently in Stage 4 of its presale, priced at just $0.0013.

2025-07-05T09:15:07,"Ancient Bitcoin Whales Abruptly Come Alive, Move $2,183,000,000+ in BTC After Lying Dormant for 14+ Years: On-Chain Data","Two Bitcoin ( BTC ) whales have come out of a long slumber and moved billions of dollars worth of the flagship crypto asset, according to on-chain data. Blockchain tracking firm Lookonchain says the two Bitcoin addresses that each had 10,000 BTC were each emptied within minutes of each other on the 4th of July. The two wallets had received their respective Bitcoin on April 3rd of 2011 when BTC was trading at $0.78 a piece. The value of the Bitcoin in the slightly older wallet had risen from $7,805 to $1,092,370,050.73 at the time of the transfer, a gain of 13,995,672%. In the newer wallet, the value of the Bitcoin had jumped from $7,805 to $1,090,670,006.39, a 13,973,891% gain. The total value transferred from the ancient addresses adds up to $2,183,040,056. Bitcoin is trading at $109,061 at time of writing. While the wallets were dormant since April of 2011, they also received trace amounts of Bitcoin during the intervening period, possibly due to dusting attacks conducted to try to sniff out the entities behind the addresses. Dusting attacks are typically conducted by researchers, law enforcement officials or criminals. The phenomenon of long-dormant addresses suddenly getting active spurs media interest due to their potential link to the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, who remains a mystery more than one and a half decades since the crypto king was introduced to the world. The last known publicly verifiable online activity linked to Satoshi Nakamoto leads back to December of 2010 when the pseudonymous creator took to the BitcoinTalk forum to discuss a software update for Bitcoin meant to forestall denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

2025-07-05T09:00:00,"Bitcoin bulls struggle to breach $110k, memecoins PUDGY, BONK, FARTCOIN lead weekly chart","With macro concerns easing, Bitcoin bulls made an attempt to breach the $110,000 mark before pulling back. The total cryptocurrency market capitalisation, which had fallen to a weekly low of $3.36 trillion, rebounded to $3.48 trillion later in the week, driven by bullish developments out of the US. This late-week optimism pushed market sentiment higher, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index rising to 73, firmly within the Greed zone. Altcoins followed a similar upswing late in the week, but much of those gains were wiped out by Friday as Bitcoin once again failed to hold above $110,000, marking its third rejection at that level this month. Weekly momentum was largely driven by meme coins, which dominated the top 100 rankings during late Asian trading hours on July 4, capturing the spotlight with outsized gains amid broader market volatility. Why did Bitcoin go up? After some early‑week volatility, Bitcoin surged to a weekly high of $110,386 on Thursday, ignited primarily by the announcement of a landmark US–Vietnam trade agreement. Under the deal, Vietnam agreed to slash tariffs on US goods, with US tariffs dropping from previous levels of 46% to just 20%, with zero duties on imports entering Vietnam, significantly easing trade tensions and bolstering risk appetite across global markets. This diplomatic win, combined with a cooling of US export restrictions on semiconductors to China, propelled a meaningful risk-on shift, lifting equities and derivatives markets and cascading positive sentiment into crypto. Further, June’s non-farm payrolls data exceeded expectations with 147,000 jobs added, well above the projected 110,000, while the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%. Bitcoin extended its rally as traders priced in stronger consumer demand and near-term resilience, with flows into spot ETFs accelerating alongside a broader surge in risk markets. However, the fervor was short‑lived. As markets reassessed the data through the lens of Federal Reserve policy, traders scaled back expectations for a July rate cut, FedFunds futures showed a sharp rise in odds for no easing until at least September. That recalibration triggered a swift pullback, with Bitcoin dipping just under $109,000 as liquidity quickly shifted from crypto back to safer havens. What’s next for Bitcoin? Bitcoin bulls were thwarted in an attempt to regain support at $110,000 on Thursday as US employment data exceeded expectations, dealing a blow to hopes of interest-rate cuts before September. This is the third failed attempt since the May all-time high, casting doubt on Bitcoin’s ability to breach $110,000 and enter price discovery again. Historically, multiple rejections near all-time highs have preceded sharp drops in BTC price. For example, Bitcoin price was rejected multiple times from the $107,000 level in January, just 2% below the previous all-time high of $109,000 reached on Jan 20. This preceded a 14% price drop over the two weeks that followed. If history repeats, some analysts are worried the BTC/USD pair might drop 14%-18% from current price levels. Additionally, high-taker sell volume around $110,000 and neutral funding rates in futures markets point to profit-taking and hesitation among traders, increasing the likelihood of a pullback. Such trends are common when prices hover near all-time highs, often prompting long-term holders to realise profits and exit positions. Looking at the 24-hour liquidation heatmap for the Bitcoin BTC/USDT trading pair, it’s clear that there’s strong resistance around the $110,000 to $112,000 mark. These areas have consistently rejected upward momentum, confirming that sellers are dominating at higher levels and limiting Bitcoin’s ability to enter price discovery. Binance BTC/USDT Liquidation Heatmap. Source: Coinglass. On the downside, support appears to be forming near the $106,000 and $104,000 levels, with visible absorption and liquidations indicating renewed buyer interest. If current selling pressure intensifies, a breakdown below these thresholds could open the door for a deeper correction toward $103,000, where the next liquidation cluster lies. For now, Bitcoin could be moving rangebound between $103,000 and $110,000, unless market sentiment tilts decisively in either direction. One potential trigger for short-term volatility could be selling pressure from “Satoshi era” Bitcoin holders. Over the past week, a number of dormant whales re-emerged, most notably a coordinated move from eight wallets that had been inactive for over 14 years, collectively transferring out 80,009 BTC, worth an estimated $8.69 billion at the time of movement. Crypto Rover @rovercrc · Follow UPDATE:ALL 8 WALLETS WOKE UP AFTER 14 YEARS OF DORMANCY AND TRANSFERRED OUT 80,009 $BTC WORTH $8.69B. 8:52 PM · Jul 4, 2025 986 Reply Copy link Read 197 replies While the destination wallets remain unknown, such large-scale movements from early holders often signal internal rebalancing, custodial shifts, or potential liquidation, factors that tend to unsettle near-term market confidence when Bitcoin is already struggling to sustain new highs. Nevertheless, some analysts believe bullish developments in the US could reinforce momentum for Bitcoin and see it hitting new highs in the coming days. Much of that optimism centres on the potential impact of President Donald Trump’s so-called “Big Beautiful Bill,” a massive spending package expected to inject trillions into the US economy. The bill, which is reportedly being finalised around Independence Day, has already sparked renewed interest in risk assets, including Bitcoin. Historical precedents suggest this optimism may not be misplaced. When Trump signed a major COVID-19 relief bill in late 2020, Bitcoin jumped by 38% over the following weeks. If a similar reaction plays out again, a comparable rally would push BTC/USD well past $150,000. Crypto Rover @rovercrc · Follow THE LAST TIME TRUMP INTRODUCED A MASSIVE SPENDING BILL.BITCOIN PUMPED 38% IN JUST ONE WEEK.HE IS EXPECTED TO SIGN THE BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL INTO LAW TOMORROW.👀 1:32 PM · Jul 4, 2025 830 Reply Copy link Read 129 replies Markets are also factoring in the implications of mounting U.S. debt. Forecasts suggest the national debt could hit $40 trillion in 2025, nearly double the $23.2 trillion recorded at the start of 2020. From a macroeconomic standpoint, such aggressive borrowing has traditionally acted as a tailwind for Bitcoin, which thrives in environments of fiat dilution and fiscal expansion. If the “Big Beautiful Bill” becomes law, the flood of liquidity it unleashes may offset near-term resistance and profit-taking, setting the stage for Bitcoin to break out of its current range and resume its long-term uptrend. When writing, Bitcoin was hovering over $107,500, up just 0.3% over the past 7 days. Top Altcoin this week The total market cap of all altcoins rose 8% to a weekly high of $1.35 trillion before settling at around $1.29 trillion as of press time. Ethereum, the altcoin with the biggest market cap, was up 3.2% over the past 7 days, trading around $2,500 key support level. XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL), Tron (TRX), and Dogecoin (DOGE) held gains ranging between 2 and 7%. The highest gains this week were pulled by Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), which rose 62.7% over the period. Bonk (BONK) and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) followed with gains of 26.4% and 19.4% respectively. Source: CoinMarketCap PENGU rallied for seven straight days following a surge in interest after the Cboe BZX Exchange proposed the listing of the Canary PENGU ETF with the US securities regulator. Additionally, its listing on crypto exchange Biconomy.com and a surge in NFT sales over the past week also contributed to its price appreciation. Bonk’s rally this week followed after the project’s team disclosed plans to burn 1 trillion BONK tokens from circulation once the number of holders hits 1 million, a milestone that is aimed at creating long-term scarcity. According to data from CoinGecko Terminal, the current holder count stands at approximately 943,890. At this rate, the 1 million threshold is expected to be reached in the coming months. While no particular development could be identified for FARTCOIN’s gains when writing, it was likely driven by a broader rally across the memecoin market sparked by Bitcoin’s recovery this week.

2025-07-05T09:00:00,"LATAM crypto news: Costa Rica advances on crypto regulation as Blockchain boosts rice farming in Panama","Latin America’s crypto scene continues to evolve, with new products and regional expansions highlighting its rapid growth. This week’s most notable news is that Costa Rica moves forward with its plans to regulate crypto activities in the country as the sector rapidly expands. Panama, on the other hand, is introducing blockchain technology into rice production, becoming a regional leader in agricultural innovation. Costa Rica advances toward cryptocurrency regulation Costa Rica’s Legislative Assembly has submitted a ground-breaking law to regulate Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), which includes cryptocurrency exchanges. This legislation seeks to strengthen the General Superintendency of Financial Institutions (Sugef) capabilities by establishing a more robust framework for overseeing and controlling cryptocurrency transactions. If passed, the bill would require exchanges to develop client identification systems and rigorous Know Your Customer (KYC) processes. One of the bill’s core sections requires exchanges to gather and store detailed client and transaction data, particularly for politically exposed individuals and users in high-risk countries. The project aims to combat money laundering and terrorism financing by ensuring compliance with international financial security requirements. Sugef would also maintain a public list of authorised exchanges, guaranteeing that only compliant actors can operate legally. Blockchain boosts rice farming in Panama Panama has become a regional leader in agricultural innovation after incorporating blockchain technology into rice cultivation. The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and Panama’s Ministry of Agricultural Development (MIDA) are leading the project, which includes 106 local rice farmers who utilise blockchain to track crops, access real-time data, and make educated decisions that increase profitability. Farmers’ incomes have increased by an average of 98% thanks to satellite tools and over 60,000 technical reports, while environmental impact has been reduced through climate-smart practices such as the NAMA mitigation framework. This approach demonstrates how blockchain might promote sustainable agriculture and revolutionise business paradigms in Latin America. Young Argentines drive crypto adoption in Buenos Aires A recent Emergente Analytics analysis found that 7 out of 10 Bitcoin users under 30 in Buenos Aires are students , demonstrating early acceptance among young individuals in training. The poll, which was performed in September 2024 with 120 participants from Buenos Aires and its surrounding metropolitan region, also revealed that 80% of existing users identify as male, indicating a major gender disparity in the ecosystem’s early growth. Interestingly, nearly 70% of women surveyed who are not yet crypto users showed a desire to begin using cryptocurrencies soon, indicating a potential shift in gender composition. Social media emerged as the primary source of information, with perceived security, platform repute, and usability outweighing profitability and customer service when selecting a platform.

2025-07-05T08:56:32,"Brazil Central Bank Connector Hacked, $140 Million Stolen","C&M Software, the service provider linking Brazil Central Bank to local banks and financial institutions, suffered a significant security breach on Wednesday. The hack led to the theft of 800 million Brazilian reais (around $140 million) from six financial institutions connected to the central bank, in what is emerging as one of the country’s largest recent financial cyber incidents. According to Brazilian outlet São Paulo, the breach reportedly occurred after a C&M employee sold their login credentials for around $2,700, providing the attackers with access to critical software systems. The stolen funds were taken from reserve accounts within the system and swiftly moved out, causing alarm among stakeholders and regulators monitoring financial infrastructure in Brazil. Crypto Laundering Through LATAM Exchanges Onchain investigator ZachXBT reported that between $30 million and $40 million of the stolen funds were converted into Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and Tether (USDT). The attackers laundered these assets through various Latin American crypto exchanges and over-the-counter (OTC) desks, making fund recovery and tracing efforts significantly harder for authorities. This incident underlines the vulnerabilities that centralized software systems face, particularly those managing financial flows at a national level. Centralized systems carry single points of failure that can result in significant data theft or financial loss if exploited, and the problem is only growing as hackers refine their techniques with the help of artificial intelligence tools and dark web marketplaces. Calls for Privacy Tools and Decentralization Grow Cybersecurity experts note a sharp rise in attacks on centralized crypto exchanges in late 2024, according to Chainalysis, as hackers increasingly target platforms with large asset pools and consolidated control points. Eran Barak, CEO of Shielded Technologies, emphasized the need for privacy-preserving tools to guard against advanced AI-assisted hacking attempts. Barak argued that decentralized systems, particularly those leveraging zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), can reduce hackers’ incentives by requiring them to attack individual wallets rather than centralized vaults holding millions of credentials or billions in capital. “Their return on investment would be one record instead of millions, making these attacks far less attractive,” Barak explained. As the investigation unfolds in Brazil, this incident reinforces the urgent need for stronger cybersecurity and privacy infrastructure in the global financial sector, particularly as attackers expand their focus on centralized systems that remain high-value targets for financial crime .

2025-07-05T08:45:16,"Ripple CTO Says Bitcoin Creator Likely Holds Huge Amount of XRP, Court Document Reveals","A recently resurfaced court document from the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple has revealed that Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, suggested that the creator of Bitcoin, known under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, likely owned a substantial amount of XRP. This assertion was made during Schwartz’s deposition filed in 2023, as part of the ongoing legal proceedings brought by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission against Ripple Labs. The deposition transcript, shared online by the X account XrpHodL, includes Schwartz’s comments on how Ripple’s management of XRP compares to the distribution of Bitcoin. He pointed to Ripple’s operational control of XRP as a competitive advantage in building a payments ecosystem. On the topic of Bitcoin’s distribution, he acknowledged it is much harder to track due to its decentralized nature. Nonetheless, he stated: “Satoshi, the original Bitcoin creator, probably held an enormous amount of XRP at the time.” When asked what time, he said “2017”. Schwartz noted that Ripple deliberately focused on building infrastructure and utility around XRP as part of its payment solutions, while no comparable development efforts were undertaken for Bitcoin. According to him, the company’s ability to influence XRP’s ecosystem distinguished it from Bitcoin, whose distribution and control remain opaque. His deposition emphasized that Ripple’s direct role in XRP’s adoption set it apart from Bitcoin’s purely decentralized approach. David Schwartz said Satoshi holds $XRP … LINK TO COURT CASE PDF BELOW https://t.co/NgaHK0tbyE pic.twitter.com/0UH4Sc1QPK — (@XrpHodL_) July 4, 2025 We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Speculation Linking Schwartz and Nakamoto Schwartz’s statement that Satoshi “probably held an enormous amount of XRP” points to a possible connection between him and Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator. Although Schwartz has never claimed to be Nakamoto, various coincidences in the history of cryptocurrency development have fueled rumors. Observers have previously noted that the timeline of XRP Ledger’s development and Satoshi Nakamoto’s withdrawal from Bitcoin appear to align. Nakamoto announced his intent to “move on to other things” in 2011, which is also the year Schwartz began to publicly express interest in working on new projects. Further adding to this speculation is the fact that Schwartz, alongside Arthur Britto and Jed McCaleb, initiated development of the XRP Ledger shortly thereafter, which culminated in its 2012 launch. Ripple adopted the XRP Ledger as the foundation of its blockchain-based payment platform. No Evidence Confirms Schwartz as Satoshi Nakamoto Despite these observations and Schwartz’s comment on Satoshi’s supposed XRP holdings, there is no evidence confirming that Schwartz is the individual behind the Nakamoto pseudonym. His statement during the deposition has nonetheless added to the ongoing curiosity about the identity of Bitcoin’s creator and their potential involvement in other blockchain projects. While Schwartz’s remarks offer insight into how Ripple viewed its role in XRP’s development relative to Bitcoin’s trajectory, they remain speculative regarding Nakamoto’s holdings or identity.

Crypto has never been more in the cultural zeitgeist than it is in 2025. Ever since Donald Trump took the Whitehouse, Wall Street has been just as concerned with the price of Bitcoin ( BTC ) as it has been with Tesla, Nvidia, or the S&P 500. You might also like: Stablecoins: The gateway to mainstream crypto in 2025 | Opinion The free world has never been able to separate fringe technology from the mainstream—it eventually becomes the same, and we are now seeing this happen with crypto, and spearheading the transition is the humble stablecoin, a part of crypto that was once a shadowy effigy; is now out in the open for all to see. Stablecoins, thanks to being pegged against fiat currencies, can take on all the roles of traditional currency. From commercial bank integration to remittance payments, stablecoins have never been ‘cool’ in the memecoin or BTC sense; instead, it’s the one part of crypto that actively puts its head above the decentralised water and runs in tandem with pre-existing financial systems. In 2024, global stablecoin transactions passed $27.6tn and the stablecoin market capitalisation in 2025 sits at $238bn currently—and its adoption during this time has largely gone unnoticed. The demand for stablecoins has gone supersonic, thanks firstly to the world’s largest private banks. In 2019, JP Morgan developed the internally used JPM Coin to facilitate cross-institutional transactions. With the rapid growth of interbank transactions, which make up $1bn in stablecoin transactions daily, governments have had no choice but to regulate. Europe The European Union was the first governing body to blink first across the Atlantic. The Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) came into full force at the end of 2024 and offers a streamlined approach to regulation, prioritising consumer protection and anti-money laundering. The pro-consumer stablecoin landscape in the EU has allowed crypto to infiltrate everyday citizens’ lives like a wolf in sheep’s clothing. Trust and the implementation of robust, clear user guidance have been critical in the implementation of MiCA by the European Banking Authority . As a result, the stability created in the market led to an increase in EURC stablecoin transactions, from $7m to $21m between December and January 2025. There is a clear need, facilitated through banking institutions, for everyday consumers for stablecoins, especially in Europe, as cross-border transactions and remittance continue to become disproportionately more important in a world getting more comfortable with mass migration and open borders. The United States In the U.S., stablecoins have had a more nuanced path to infiltrating everyday use cases. JP Morgan may have been one of the first movers when it came to cross-institutional payments, but the U.S. opened the floodgates early, and under Gary Gensler, crypto was a hostage to archaic hang-ups and tin foil hat-inspired rhetoric, with Gensler claiming crypto was “unlikely [to] be a currency”, thanks to the fact that “the leading lights of this field are either in jail or awaiting extradition”. Crypto was never going to show its best side pre-regulation, and since Donald Trump took the White House in 2025, crypto regulation in the US is evolving at a rate not seen before; cue the GENIUS act. The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act, for the first time, gives both issuers and users of stablecoins clarity on their lawfulness within society and how they can be used. With this, the CFTC has also been announced as the primary regulator of digital commodities and payment stablecoins, further legitimising its position as part of the traditional finance furniture in the U.S. While the industry is still in its infancy compared to the EU, the impact that robust regulation will have for the rest of the world will be disproportionately more important. If the world salutes the Euro, then it bows to the dollar, and stablecoins will add yet another arrow to the dollar’s ever-growing quiver. Now that the stage is set and the world’s largest players have clarity, stablecoin adoption at both the institutional and consumer level is set to go supernova. Leading UK bank Standard Chartered has estimated the GENIUS act will “cause total stablecoin supply to rise from $230bn to $2tn by end-2028”. One of the largest infiltrations into traditional finance to date is the transfer of U.S. treasuries to stablecoin issuers, with $1.2tn in U.S. debt set to be bought by Tether, Circle, and other dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies by 2030. Once reserved for institutional stalwarts like Berkshire Hathaway, crypto is pulling up a seat at the TradFi table and is set to have a larger piece of the treasury pie than China, Japan & the UK in just five years. With the GENIUS Act and MiCA in full swing, and institutional driving stablecoin transactions, it will not be long before a lot of the FIAT capital flow globally will be represented by stablecoins. The Vice President of blockchain and digital assets at Mastercard, Raj Dhamodharan, recently highlighted that “most people won’t even know they’re using stablecoins” as the digital infrastructure required for crypto adoption is already in place.

The Central Bank of Brazil is actively working to recover the funds after discovering the offender. Central Bank’s Immediate Action Against the Crime After discovering the theft and the attacker, the central bank immediately issued a notice for a temporary suspension of C&M Software. By Wednesday, the company resumed limited operations under supervision. The federal police have opened an investigation at the Cybercrime Repression Department in Brasilia, investigating stolen funds and preventing further laundering in the chain. Currently, the police are investigating a series of questions about those responsible for the hacker attack, and other beneficiaries of the scam are being investigated. Discovery of Brazil’s Cyber Theft of $140 Million Approximately $140 million was theft by hacking C&M software, the service provider that connects Brazil’s central bank to local banks and other financial institutions. At least $30 to $40 million of the stolen funds were converted into cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin , Ethereum , and Tether. This conversation of fiat money into crypto was carried out via Latin American over-the-counter (OTC) brokers and crypto exchanges . Brazilian officers suspected a laundering route tied to Brazil’s PIX payments infrastructure (a system developed by the central bank to enable instant payments). [post_titles_links postid=”477206″] The Grand Theft Stemming from Internal Compromise Brazilian law enforcement confirmed that the breach stemmed from an internal compromise. João Nazareno Roque, a software employee at C&M, admitted to selling corporate private credentials to one of the attackers for R$5,000. The initial contact between the attacker and Roque occurred in March, when the suspect showed detailed knowledge of Roque’s job. Later, the employee was paid extra R$10,000 to execute the grand theft commands inside the system. Final Thought The incident of $140 million theft has triggered broad discussion on fintech cybersecurity, third-party provider risks, and regulatory oversight. While the case remains under investigation, Brazilian officials are targeting to end these cybercrimes altogether.

A dormant wallet holding 10,000 BTC reactivated after 14.2 years, realizing a staggering 3,176,464% ROI.

2025-07-05T08:00:58,"Why Crypto Market is Down Today? (05th July, 2025)","The post Why Crypto Market is Down Today? (05th July, 2025) appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market today has experienced a broad-based downturn today, with the total industry market capitalization slipping to $3.33 trillion. Trading volume also shrank considerably by 16.50%, now standing at $93 billion, signaling cautious attitude from investors. Bitcoin remains the dominant force with a 64.6% market share, followed distantly by Ethereum at 9.1%. A combination of macro events and sudden whale activity has injected fresh volatility into the digital asset space. The Fear & Greed Index rests at a neutral 51, reflecting indecision among market participants. A significant development casting a shadow over today’s action is the $3.6 billion crypto options expiry. Of that total, Bitcoin accounts for $2.98 billion and Ethereum $610 million. The unwinding of these contracts has led to volatility and uncertain short-term moves, as traders reassess risk amid high open interest. Whale Activity and Option Expiry Unnerve Investors? Bitcoin’s price has slipped by 0.68% over the last 24 hours, currently hovering around $108,294.97. While the dip may seem modest, the root cause is raising alarm bells. As a dormant wallet containing 80,009 BTC, which was inactive for over 14 years, has suddenly moved approximately $8.7 billion worth of tokens. Such activity typically highlights security concerns and fears of large-scale dumping, which often prompts a wave of defensive selling. This movement coincided with today’s massive options expiry event, further intensifying downward pressure. Also read our Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! Ethereum is not immune either. The second-largest crypto has declined 1.2%, now trading at $2,527.90. This pullback is largely linked to short-term profit-taking following a strong 4.09% weekly performance. Moreover, ETH faced stiff resistance near $2,600, which drove liquidations of over-leveraged long positions. Liquidation Shakeout Hits Market Liquidation events have further strained investor sentiment. Bitcoin’s leveraged long positions took a hit amid the dormant wallet scare, triggering cascading liquidations. The overall 24-hour trading volume for BTC has fallen by 14.9%, now at $42.47 billion. Ethereum’s fall is a case of technical rejection. The failed attempt to break above $2,600 led to profit booking and liquidation of weak hands. The combined pressure from options expiry and short-term resistance zones added fuel to the correction. XRP, meanwhile, is down 0.25% to $2.22 after failing to maintain its breakout above the $2.27–$2.30 range. The market also seemed underwhelmed by Ripple’s recent announcement about securing a banking license, which failed to generate strong bullish momentum.

2025-07-05T08:00:17,"Solana Tests Rising Channel Support – Breakdown Could Send Price To $128.50 Level","Solana is facing a critical test this week, consolidating in a tight range between $145 and $160 since Monday. The price action reflects strong buying interest but also hesitation as bulls struggle to reclaim higher levels. Despite holding above key support, Solana must break decisively above resistance to confirm a bullish breakout and continue its upward trend. Related Reading: Ethereum Forms Rising Wedge Pattern – $2,200 Support Back In Focus? Market momentum has favored bulls in recent weeks, but Solana’s inability to breach the $160 zone raises questions about the strength of this trend. Top analyst Carl Runefelt shared insights highlighting that Solana is currently ranging within a rising channel pattern—a structure that, while seemingly bullish, can often precede a breakdown to lower demand zones if support fails. This makes the coming days especially important for SOL’s trajectory. As macro conditions improve and Bitcoin flirts with new all-time highs, Solana is expected to respond in kind. However, technical signals suggest caution. A break below the rising channel could target the $128.50 support area, while a successful breakout above $160 could open the door to retesting local highs. Traders and investors alike are closely watching Solana’s next move in this high-stakes consolidation phase. Solana Holds Key Support Amid Rising Channel Formation Solana is currently trading below the $150 level, reflecting a notable 20% decline from its local high set in May. Despite this setback, the asset continues to hold a strong support base, signaling that bullish sentiment has not entirely faded. The broader market remains in a consolidation phase, with Solana showing signs of indecision as it moves sideways within a tightening price range. Analysts remain cautiously optimistic, pointing out that a breakout above the key $150–$160 supply zone could spark renewed upside momentum. However, the current price structure suggests that Solana may not be ready yet to retest previous highs. According to Carl Runefelt, Solana is ranging within a rising channel—a pattern that can lead to sharp movements if broken. While rising channels can sustain bullish continuation, a breakdown below the lower trendline often results in accelerated downside moves. Runefelt warns that if Solana breaks below the channel, the next key support area lies around $128.50. This level has historically acted as a strong demand zone and could serve as the next target in the event of a bearish move. In the meantime, Solana’s consolidation reflects broader market uncertainty, with traders waiting for a decisive breakout or breakdown to guide positioning. A successful reclaim of the $150 level would improve sentiment significantly and could set the stage for a push toward the $170–$180 range. On the other hand, failure to hold above current levels may shift the narrative toward further downside risk. Related Reading: Chainlink Consolidates Above Key Support – Bulls Eye $20 Range SOL Holds Range Amid Resistance Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $147.62, moving sideways within a tightening range and forming a potential rising channel pattern. The daily chart reveals that SOL has been unable to break decisively above the $155–$160 resistance zone, while strong support remains near the $140 level. Price action shows repeated rejections near the 100-day moving average (blue line), which now acts as dynamic resistance around $155.60. The 200-day moving average (red) sits further above $165.54, marking a long-term resistance area. Volume remains relatively low compared to early June spikes, suggesting market participants are waiting for a clear breakout direction. A push above $160 would likely trigger bullish momentum, potentially opening the door toward the $170 level. However, the rising channel identified by analysts suggests a possible downside risk if the lower trendline fails. Related Reading: Litecoin Surges Past Descending Resistance – Bulls Target $97.10 Level If Solana breaks below the $145 support and falls out of the channel, the next target would be the $128.50 area, which previously acted as a demand zone in mid-May.

The coming sessions may offer clarity as consolidation nears its resolution.

2025-07-05T07:48:54,"Bitcoin Price Crash Coming? Analyst Predicts 80% Drop Soon","The post Bitcoin Price Crash Coming? Analyst Predicts 80% Drop Soon appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin may seem bullish right now , but a leading crypto analyst has issued a shocking warning: a crash of over 80% could be just around the corner. While Bitcoin has climbed 3.3% in the last 30 days and currently trades at $108,161, concerns are building beneath the surface. Crypto analyst EDO FARINA XRP , who commands a following of more than 167,000 on X, believes Bitcoin’s rally is dangerously overheated. In a recent post, he predicted that a sudden, sharp correction is not just possible—it’s imminent. And when it hits, he warns, it will be fast and severe. Bitcoin Market Is Overheating According to the analyst, Bitcoin’s recent surge isn’t backed by fundamentals. Since the U.S. political shift in November 2024 , Bitcoin has surged by nearly 60%. In Q2 2025 alone, it delivered a quarterly return of 29.9%, and so far in July, it has grown by nearly 1%. But the economic backdrop tells a different story. Inflation in the U.S. has eased to 2.4%, close to the Federal Reserve’s target. Still, GDP growth is slowing—projected to drop to 1.8% in 2025. The labor market is cooling too, with unemployment rising to 4.1% in June, while consumer spending is expected to weaken. The analyst suggests this kind of economic environment doesn’t support such an aggressive BTC rally. Missed the Bitcoin Boom? EDO FARINA argues that the best time to buy Bitcoin was years ago. In 2020, BTC returned a staggering 304.1%, followed by a solid 59.6% in 2021. Although 2022 saw a major correction with a 64.3% drop, the market bounced back strongly—posting gains of 115.4% in 2023 and 121.1% in 2024. According to the analyst, today’s price level is no longer ideal for those seeking “safe” long-term gains. Bitcoin Whales Are Allegedly Selling Another red flag is the behavior of Bitcoin whales. The analyst claims that large holders, especially those owning Satoshi-era coins, are moving their BTC to exchanges. Each time the price approaches the critical $110,000 level, it faces strong resistance. For instance, on May 22, BTC touched $111,662. But by the next day, the market dropped nearly 4%. On June 10, Bitcoin climbed to $110,266, only to fall by more than 8% over the next 12 days. A similar trend occurred on July 3, when BTC touched $110,681 and dropped by 1.44% the very next day. These repeated sell-offs around the $110K mark suggest that whales are actively cashing out, keeping Bitcoin from breaking out to a new high. [post_titles_links postid=”478664″] The Real Concern: Low Trading Volume According to Farina, what’s even more dangerous than whale selling is the low trading volume in the current market. Compared to previous bull runs, fewer retail investors are buying. The analyst argues that today’s price action is driven by a few large players, not widespread demand. This poses a serious risk. If whales decide to dump their holdings all at once, there may not be enough buying support to hold the price up. This lack of liquidity could trigger a cascade of sell-offs and lead to a massive crash. Could Bitcoin Crash Soon? Farina believes the crash will be triggered by a major, unexpected event—what’s often called a “black swan” in financial markets. Once it happens, the crash will be swift and brutal, catching most investors off-guard. He concludes that Bitcoin’s current high is artificially inflated and not supported by real market activity. Without strong and broad demand, the price could collapse quickly when the pressure hits. While Bitcoin’s price action appears bullish , the warning signs are hard to ignore. Whale movements, resistance at $110K, weak economic fundamentals, and low volume suggest that the rally might not be as healthy as it looks. Whether this ends in a soft pullback or a dramatic crash, investors may want to stay alert.

In a post on the social media platform X, the billionaire says that Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” will increase the US national debt from about $230,000 per American household to $425,000 per American household over the next decade. The ballooning national debt will have severe ramifications, according to Dalio. “Now that the budget bill has passed Congress, we can see what the projections look like for deficits, government debt, and debt service expenses. In brief, the bill is expected to lead to spending of about $7 trillion a year with inflows of about $5 trillion a year, so the debt, which is now about 6x of the money taken in, 100% of GDP, and about $230,000 per American family, will rise over ten years to about 7.5x the money taken in, 130% of GDP and $425,000 per family. That will increase interest and principal payments on the debt from about $10 trillion ($1 trillion in interest, $9 trillion in principal) to about $18 trillion (of which $2 trillion is interest payments), which will lead to either a big squeezing out (and cutting off) of spending and/or unimaginable tax increases, or a lot of printing and devaluing of money and pushing interest rates to unattractively low levels.” Dalio believes the remedy to the looming fiscal crises is to cut spending and raise taxes to lower the annual deficit to gross domestic product (GDP) ratio. “This printing and devaluing is not good for those holding bonds as a storehold of wealth, and what’s bad for bonds and US credit markets is bad for everyone because the US Treasury market is the backbone of all capital markets, which are the backbones of our economic and social conditions. Unless this path is soon rectified to bring the budget deficit from roughly 7% of GDP to about 3% by making adjustments to spending, taxes, and interest rates, big, painful disruptions will likely occur.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-05T07:00:28,"Oregon Vs Coinbase: AG Files Motion To Keep ‘Gensler-Era Copycat Lawsuit’ In State Court","Oregon’s Attorney General (AG) has filed a motion to keep the lawsuit against Coinbase in state court, following the crypto exchange’s efforts to move the litigation to federal court. Oregon Says Coinbase Case Must Stay In State Courts On July 2, Oregon’s Attorney General, Dan Rayfield, filed a motion to remand its lawsuit against Coinbase back to the Circuit Court of the State of Oregon for Multnomah County. The motion follows the crypto exchange’s attempt to move the case to federal court. In early June, Coinbase filed a notice of removal, seeking to take the action from the Oregon courts to federal court, arguing that the case raises a federal question. The exchange argues that Oregon’s state law (OSL) claims “arise under” the federal law because the state’s courts use the federal Securities Act of 1993, and the federal Howey Test, for guidance to define what constitutes an “investment contract.” However, Oregon’s motion explains that “almost 50 years ago, the Supreme Court of Oregon, sitting en banc , broke stride with Howey in its interpretation of an ‘investment contract’ under the OSL, deciding the term should be ‘modified’ to encompass a broader range of investment schemes. Pratt v. Kross , 276, Or. 483, 497 (1976).” Since then, Oregon courts have followed the Pratt Test, which applies a broader definition of investment contract. The AG noted that “because Oregon does not strictly follow the Howey test, the State’s claims here do not turn on the Howey test.” The motion claims that the lawsuit isn’t a “regulatory land grab,” as Coinbase called it. Instead, it is a “quintessential state law action” that seeks redress on behalf of Oregonians under the state’s law. Therefore, it should be “adjudicated by the state court in which the Attorney General filed it.” Oregon’s ‘Gensler-Era’ Lawsuit On April 18, Oregon’s AG filed a complaint in Multnomah County Circuit Court against Coinbase, alleging the crypto exchange had violated the Oregon securities law by facilitating the sale of unregistered cryptocurrencies to the state’s residents. As reported by Bitcoinist, the lawsuit states that the exchange “has continuously and repeatedly violated the Oregon Securities Law, which ascribes liability to persons ´who [s]ell[] or successfully solicit[] the sale of a security … in violation of the Oregon Securities Law’ (ORS 59.115(1)(a)), as well as to persons who ‘participate[] or materially aid[] in the sale’ (ORS 59.115(3)).” Following the news, Coinbase’s CLO, Paul Grewal, affirmed that Rayfield is “literally picking up where the Gary Gensler SEC left off,” adding that the lawsuit is a “copycat case” attempting to “resurrect” the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) long-criticized regulatory approach under the previous administration. The SEC sued Coinbase in June 2023, affirming that the platform operated as an unregistered broker-dealer and illegally sold unregistered securities through its staking program. However, the lawsuit was dismissed in February 2025 following the establishment of the agency’s Crypto Task Force. Oregon’s lawsuit now claims that Coinbase sold high-risk investments without properly vetting to protect consumers, which has caused significant losses for Oregonians. Notably, the case covers significantly more tokens than the SEC originally named in its case, which listed 13 tokens. The lawsuit claims that the crypto exchange offered and sold 31 cryptocurrencies as investment contracts. In a Wednesday post , Grewal called out Rayfield for attempting to send his “Gensler-era copycat” lawsuit back to state courts, affirming that it goes against the US’s recent progress developing a clear and unified framework for the industry. In most places, it’s 2025. But the Oregon AG still thinks it’s 2023 with his Gensler-era @secgov copycat suit. Yesterday, he asked the federal court to send the case back to his home state court. This pursuit of a patchwork of state regulation – especially against the historic progress towards a unified federal framework – only helps politicians and harms consumers.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/oregon-vs-coinbase-ag-files-motion-to-keep-gensler-era-copycat-lawsuit-in-state-court/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|coinbase|Coinbase lawsuit|crypto lawsuit|Oregon AG|Oregon Attorney General|Oregon vs Coinbase|SEC|SEC vs Coinbase|Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)",cryptocompare

Turkey Bans PancakeSwap The Turkish financial regulator, CMB, announced that it had taken legal action against PancakeSwap , a high-profile DEX that handled over $325 billion in trading volume in June. The CMB did not specify how it determined PancakeSwap was in breach of Turkish law. PancakeSwap has now become the first decentralized exchange banned in Turkey. The exchange failed to meet the licensing requirement set by CMB. Apart from PancakeSwap, CMB also banned Cryptoradar and Exchange Investr, along with more than 40 other websites. Why did Turkey Ban PancakeSwap? CMB has not yet released a criterion behind the enforcement, and PancakeSwap has not commented on the action. However, this step could be seen as a part of a broader strategy in Turkey, as the regulators are aiming to advance their goal of improving market stability and investor protection. Turkey is enhancing its regulatory framework to protect users from potential financial risks and illicit transactions. Under new regulations, it is tightening its security measures by increasing crypto market transparency through licensing and anti-money laundering (AML) rules. So the decision of the PancakeSwap ban follows the regulatory authority granted to the CMB last year, allowing it to block unlicensed foreign cryptocurrency service platforms targeting Turkish users. [post_titles_links postid=”478736″] Turkey Tightens Crypto Rules in 2025 On 28th June, Turkey published new, stricter rules for crypto in the Official Gazette, to maintain security and transparency in the transactions. Under Law No. 5549, the regulators introduced new transfer limits, mandatory waiting periods, and anti-money laundering (AML) policies in a bold move to tighten CMB oversight over crypto. Besides this, the country implemented a series of new regulations to mitigate risks in the crypto space. Final Thought It is crucial for all crypto service-providing platforms to seek proper approval from official regulators to continue operations in Turkey. This enforcement of banning websites is a precedent for other exchanges and platforms to comply with the Turkish regulatory regime. CMB and PancakeSwap have yet to deliver a comment regarding the enforcement. [article_inside_subscriber_shortcode title=”Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!” description=”Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more.” category_name=”News” category_id=”6″] FAQs What specific regulations did PancakeSwap violate to be banned by the CMB? The Turkish Capital Markets Board (CMB) banned PancakeSwap for “providing unauthorized crypto services” and failing to meet the licensing requirements it set for virtual asset service providers. The specific details of the breach weren’t elaborated, but it falls under the CMB’s authority to block unlicensed foreign platforms targeting Turkish users. How will the ban affect Turkish users of PancakeSwap and other blocked platforms? The ban restricts direct access for Turkish users to PancakeSwap and the other 45 blocked platforms, pushing them towards licensed, centralized exchanges or potentially into less secure methods like VPNs to bypass restrictions. This could reduce DeFi participation and stifle innovation within Turkey’s crypto community. Can PancakeSwap or other blocked platforms appeal the ban or obtain a license to operate in Turkey? The article doesn’t specify if PancakeSwap can appeal the ban directly. However, for any crypto service provider to operate legally in Turkey, they would need to comply with the CMB’s licensing requirements and new regulations, including AML/CFT and KYC rules.

2025-07-05T06:30:49,"Unveiling the Critical Truth: Is Your Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Truly Sustainable?","BitcoinWorld Unveiling the Critical Truth: Is Your Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Truly Sustainable? In the dynamic world of digital assets, few topics spark as much debate and fascination as a company’s decision to integrate Bitcoin (BTC) into its treasury. Once heralded as a visionary move, a recent commentary from Glassnode lead analyst James Check has cast a shadow of doubt over the long-term viability of the Bitcoin treasury strategy . Are we witnessing a pivotal moment where the shine of corporate BTC holdings is beginning to fade for new entrants? This article delves deep into these concerns, exploring the nuances of corporate Bitcoin adoption, the inherent crypto risk, and what it truly takes for a digital asset strategy to be sustainable. The Genesis of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption: Why Companies Embraced BTC Holdings For several years, the narrative around companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets was overwhelmingly positive. Pioneers like MicroStrategy led the charge, viewing Bitcoin as a superior alternative to traditional fiat currencies, a hedge against inflation, and a strategic asset signaling innovation and forward-thinking leadership. The allure was multifaceted: Inflation Hedge: In an era of quantitative easing and rising inflation concerns, Bitcoin’s fixed supply offered a compelling alternative to depreciating fiat currencies. Innovation and Brand Image: Embracing Bitcoin allowed companies to position themselves at the forefront of technological advancement, appealing to a tech-savvy investor base and attracting talent interested in the future of finance. Balance Sheet Optimization: For some, it was a way to potentially generate significant returns on idle cash, outperforming traditional low-yield investments. Market Signal: A strong commitment to Bitcoin could be seen as a vote of confidence in the broader crypto ecosystem, potentially influencing stock prices and market perception. These motivations drove a wave of corporate Bitcoin purchases, transforming the balance sheets of publicly traded companies and setting a new precedent for treasury management in the digital age. However, as with any emerging trend, the initial enthusiasm often gives way to a more critical examination of long-term implications. Questioning Long-Term Viability: Is Your Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Still Relevant? James Check’s recent remarks on X (formerly Twitter) highlight a critical shift in perspective. He suggests that the traditional model of accumulating Bitcoin for corporate treasuries may already be losing its relevance, especially for newer participants looking to replicate past successes. His core argument is profound: ‘long-term accumulation depends more on the strength of a company’s core business and strategy than on symbolic BTC holdings.’ This statement challenges the very foundation of the ‘Bitcoin as a primary treasury asset’ philosophy. Here’s why the viability is being questioned: Diminishing Novelty for New Entrants: The initial shockwave of a company announcing BTC holdings has subsided. Newer firms attempting to mimic this strategy might not achieve the same ‘first-mover’ advantage or market excitement that early adopters did. Volatility as a Double-Edged Sword: While Bitcoin’s price appreciation can be spectacular, its volatility can equally decimate balance sheets. Quarterly earnings reports can be significantly impacted by BTC price swings, introducing an unpredictable element that traditional investors might shy away from. Opportunity Cost: Capital tied up in Bitcoin is capital not invested in core business expansion, research and development, or traditional, less volatile assets. For companies whose primary business isn’t crypto, this can be a significant drain on resources that could otherwise fuel organic growth. Regulatory Uncertainty: The global regulatory landscape for digital assets is still evolving. Changes in taxation, accounting standards, or outright prohibitions could significantly impact the value and utility of corporate BTC holdings. Focus Shift from Core Business: When a company’s financial performance becomes heavily linked to its Bitcoin holdings, there’s a risk that management’s focus might inadvertently shift from operational excellence to crypto market speculation. This can dilute investor confidence in the company’s primary value proposition. The essence of Check’s argument is that Bitcoin should complement, not define, a company’s financial health. A strong core business provides the stability and revenue streams necessary to weather market fluctuations, making any digital asset holding a strategic enhancement rather than a speculative gamble. Navigating the Peril: Sound Crypto Risk Management for Your BTC Holdings Adding to the concerns, Fakhul Miah, GoMining Institutional Managing Director, previously warned about the dangers of newer firms attempting to replicate the BTC banking model without proper risk controls. His apprehension is well-founded: a collapse due to unchecked crypto exposure could severely damage Bitcoin’s broader reputation, potentially setting back institutional adoption. What exactly constitutes ‘proper risk controls’ in the context of corporate Bitcoin adoption ? It goes far beyond simply buying and holding. It involves a sophisticated understanding of the unique risks associated with digital assets: Market Risk: The Volatility Challenge Bitcoin’s price can fluctuate wildly. A robust risk management strategy must include: Clear Allocation Limits: Defining a maximum percentage of the treasury that can be allocated to Bitcoin to prevent overexposure. Stress Testing: Regularly simulating worst-case scenarios (e.g., a 50% or 80% drop in BTC price) to understand the potential impact on the company’s balance sheet and liquidity. Rebalancing Strategies: Establishing rules for when and how to adjust BTC holdings if they grow too large or fall too low as a percentage of the overall treasury. Operational Risk: Securing Digital Assets Unlike traditional assets, Bitcoin requires specialized custody and security measures: Secure Custody Solutions: Utilizing reputable institutional-grade custodians with robust security protocols (e.g., cold storage, multi-signature wallets, air-gapped systems). Internal Controls: Implementing strict internal policies for access, transaction approvals, and audit trails to prevent fraud or error. Cybersecurity Measures: Protecting digital infrastructure from hacking attempts, phishing, and other cyber threats. Regulatory Risk: The Evolving Landscape The lack of clear, consistent global regulation poses significant challenges: Legal and Compliance Expertise: Engaging legal and compliance professionals specialized in digital assets to navigate evolving laws, tax implications, and reporting requirements. Jurisdictional Awareness: Understanding how regulations in different countries might impact the company’s ability to hold, use, or sell Bitcoin. Reputational Risk: Public Perception A company’s foray into Bitcoin can be viewed positively or negatively. Poor management of BTC holdings, especially during market downturns, can damage investor confidence and brand image. Transparent communication and consistent strategy are key. Without these foundational controls, a company’s attempt to replicate a successful Bitcoin treasury strategy can quickly devolve into a high-stakes gamble, potentially leading to financial distress and undermining the broader acceptance of digital assets in traditional finance. Beyond Symbolic: Crafting a Robust Corporate Bitcoin Strategy for Long-Term Success Given the growing concerns, how can companies approach corporate Bitcoin holdings in a way that is truly sustainable and beneficial? The answer lies in moving beyond symbolic accumulation towards a deeply integrated, risk-aware strategy. 1. Strategic Alignment with Core Business Before acquiring any Bitcoin, a company must clearly articulate how this investment aligns with its core mission, business objectives, and risk appetite. Is it truly a long-term strategic asset, or is it merely speculative? For example, a payment processing company might see Bitcoin as a natural extension of its services, while a manufacturing firm might view it purely as a treasury diversification tool. 2. Comprehensive Due Diligence Treat Bitcoin acquisition with the same rigor as any major capital expenditure or M&A activity. This includes thorough research into market dynamics, regulatory implications, security requirements, and accounting treatments. 3. Robust Treasury Management Framework Develop clear, written policies for Bitcoin holdings, including: Investment Thesis: Why are we holding Bitcoin? Allocation Limits: Maximum percentage of total treasury assets. Custody Solutions: Detailed plan for secure storage. Valuation and Accounting: Clear methodologies for reporting. Exit Strategy: Conditions under which Bitcoin holdings would be reduced or sold. 4. Active Risk Mitigation Implement the crypto risk management controls discussed earlier. This is not a one-time setup but an ongoing process that requires continuous monitoring and adaptation to market and regulatory changes. 5. Transparency and Communication Communicate your Bitcoin strategy clearly to investors, employees, and the public. Transparency builds trust and helps manage expectations, especially during periods of market volatility. Explain the rationale, the risks involved, and the long-term vision. 6. Explore Beyond Pure HODL While holding Bitcoin is a common strategy, companies might explore other avenues for digital asset integration, albeit with careful consideration of additional risks: Bitcoin for Payments: Accepting BTC for goods or services can expand customer reach and reduce transaction fees. Yield Strategies (with caution): Some companies explore lending out BTC or participating in decentralized finance (DeFi) for yield, but these come with significantly higher risks (smart contract risk, counterparty risk, impermanent loss). Indirect Exposure: Investing in Bitcoin ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) or companies with significant BTC holdings rather than direct ownership, which can simplify custody and regulatory compliance, though it still carries market risk. The key takeaway here is that a successful Bitcoin treasury strategy is not about blindly following trends but about making informed, strategic decisions that align with a company’s fundamental strengths and long-term vision. The Future Landscape: What’s Next for Corporate Bitcoin and Digital Asset Integration? The conversation around corporate Bitcoin holdings is evolving. We are likely to see a more nuanced approach from companies going forward. Instead of simply accumulating Bitcoin as a ‘symbolic’ gesture, future strategies may focus on: Utility-Driven Adoption: Companies will increasingly integrate Bitcoin and other digital assets where they offer clear operational or financial advantages, such as cross-border payments, supply chain transparency, or tokenized loyalty programs. Diversified Digital Asset Portfolios: Beyond Bitcoin, companies might explore stablecoins for operational liquidity, or other cryptocurrencies that align with specific business use cases (e.g., Ethereum for smart contract-based services). Sophisticated Treasury Management Tools: The development of more advanced software and services for managing digital assets will make it easier for corporate treasuries to handle crypto with the same rigor as traditional assets. Regulatory Clarity: As regulations mature, it will provide a clearer framework for companies to operate within, reducing uncertainty and potentially encouraging broader adoption. The journey of Bitcoin adoption by corporations is still in its early stages. The initial speculative phase is giving way to a more mature, strategic evaluation. This shift is healthy and necessary for the long-term integration of digital assets into the global economy. Conclusion: Navigating the New Frontier of Corporate Finance with Prudence James Check’s insights serve as a crucial reminder that the enthusiasm for digital assets must be tempered with pragmatic financial principles. While Bitcoin offers undeniable potential, its integration into corporate treasuries is not a panacea for all financial challenges. The long-term viability of a Bitcoin treasury strategy hinges not just on the price of BTC, but fundamentally on the robustness of a company’s core business, its strategic foresight, and its commitment to rigorous crypto risk management. For companies contemplating or currently holding Bitcoin, the message is clear: move beyond symbolic gestures. Embrace a comprehensive, disciplined approach that prioritizes financial stability, operational integrity, and a clear understanding of both the opportunities and the inherent risks. Only then can Bitcoin truly become a sustainable and valuable component of a forward-looking corporate treasury.

2025-07-05T06:30:30,"Ethereum Wave Count Predicts Price Crash To $1,800 — But $6,000 Is Still In Play","Ethereum is still struggling below $3,000 despite the Bitcoin price sitting close to all-time highs. At the current levels, Ethereum continues to look incredibly bearish, with sell-offs dominating the market at this level. While piling shorts are pointing to a possible relief rally, there is also the possibility that the price will crash back down from here. Crypto analyst Weslad maps out the ETH price trajectory using the ABCDE wave structure, showing a possible crash below $2,000. The Bullish Ethereum Scenario Weslad points to the 2021 Ethereum peak when the price reached $4,851 as the point when a large-scale symmetrical pennant had formed for the digital asset. Interestingly, this has continued for multiple years already, and continues to play out even in 2025, four years later. So far, the analyst believes that the altcoin has been in a long-term accumulation phase in a defined corrective range. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Not Remotely Close, Bitcoin Dominance Still Too High: Market Expert Says Another important development is the formation of an ABCDE wave pattern. This pattern often predicts peaks and troughs, and depending on where the asset is in the pattern, it could point to a recovery or a crash. Presently, the crypto analyst puts the Ethereum price as being somewhere in a D wave, which is still bullish for the price. “Currently, price action is developing near point D, approaching the upper boundary of the pennant, a crucial area that could define the next directional move,” the analyst said. If this D wave plays out as expected, then the Ethereum price is expected to actually surge from here. The top of this pattern would put it above $3,500 before the move is completed. On the upper end of this is the formation of an Inverse Head and Shoulders Pattern. This pattern has seen the $2,855 acting as key resistance, beating the Ethereum price down multiple times this year. However, if a sustained break is achieved above this level, in conjunction with a breakout from Wave D, then it is possible that the price does rally to new all-time highs above $6,000. The Bearish Scenario While the formation of the ABCDE wave count points to some bullishness for the Ethereum price, there is still the possibility that the price could go in the opposite direction. For example, after the D wave is completed, comes the next wave in the sequence, which is the E wave, and this is a bearish wave. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Not Remotely Close, Bitcoin Dominance Still Too High: Market Expert Says As the crypto analyst explains, a temporary rejection at the neckline or pennant resistance would trigger an E wave retracement. In this case, the Ethereum price could see an over 30% crash, putting it back toward the $1,400-$1,800 level, where there is the most support. “Recent price behavior shows compressed volatility and increased buying interest on dips, reinforcing the possibility of an imminent directional breakout,” Weslad warned. “A decisive move outside this macro structure may mark the beginning of a new phase of long-term price expansion.” Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",newsbtc,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-wave-count-1800/,"TRADING|ETH|ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET","Ethereum|ETH|ETH news|eth price|ethereum|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT",cryptocompare

2025-07-05T06:20:47,"Bitcoin Dormant Supply: Unveiling the Astonishing 30% Untouched for Five Years","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Dormant Supply: Unveiling the Astonishing 30% Untouched for Five Years The cryptocurrency world recently buzzed with news of an astounding $8 billion worth of Bitcoin moving from wallets dormant for 14 years. This massive transfer, reported by Cointelegraph, underscored a fascinating truth about Bitcoin’s ecosystem: a significant portion of its circulating supply remains untouched for extended periods. In fact, over 30.4% of all Bitcoin has not moved in more than five years, highlighting a unique aspect of its ownership and market behavior. This remarkable statistic points to a powerful underlying trend: the prevalence of Bitcoin dormant supply . What Does “Bitcoin Dormant Supply” Truly Mean? Understanding Bitcoin dormant supply is crucial for anyone trying to grasp the deeper trends within the digital asset space. Simply put, ‘dormant supply’ refers to Bitcoin that has remained in the same wallet address for a specified period without any outgoing transactions. While the recent $8 billion transfer involved Bitcoin that had been untouched for 14 years, the broader statistic of over 30% pertains to coins that haven’t moved in at least five years. This period is significant because it often indicates a strong conviction from the holder, suggesting they are not interested in short-term trading or profit-taking. On-chain analytics firms meticulously track these movements, segmenting dormant supply into various age bands, such as 1-3 years, 3-5 years, and 5+ years. The longer the dormancy period, the stronger the signal of long-term holding. This phenomenon is particularly noteworthy for Bitcoin due to its fixed supply cap of 21 million coins. When a significant portion of this limited supply is locked away in dormant wallets, it effectively reduces the amount of Bitcoin available for active trading, contributing to its scarcity and potentially influencing its value proposition as a store of value. The Unwavering Conviction of Long-Term Bitcoin Holders The significant portion of Bitcoin that remains unmoved is largely attributed to long-term Bitcoin holders . These individuals and entities embody the ‘HODL’ ethos, a term born from a misspelling of ‘hold’ during a volatile market period, which has since become a mantra for holding onto cryptocurrency regardless of price fluctuations. These holders are not swayed by daily market swings or speculative fervor; their belief is rooted in Bitcoin’s fundamental value as a decentralized, censorship-resistant, and finite digital asset. Who are these steadfast holders? They include early adopters who mined or acquired Bitcoin when it was worth mere pennies, institutional investors who have recently added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, and individual investors who view Bitcoin as a long-term hedge against inflation or a generational wealth transfer mechanism. Their collective decision to hold, often through multiple bear markets and significant price corrections, showcases a profound confidence in Bitcoin’s future potential. This commitment from long-term Bitcoin holders forms a bedrock of stability for the entire crypto ecosystem, contrasting sharply with the often-volatile short-term trading landscape. How Does Dormant Supply Influence Bitcoin Market Dynamics? The existence of such a large Bitcoin dormant supply profoundly impacts Bitcoin market dynamics . When over 30% of the circulating supply is not actively traded, it creates a unique supply-side pressure. In essence, it means that the effective liquid supply available for buying and selling is considerably smaller than the total circulating supply. This reduced liquidity can amplify price movements, as fewer coins are available to absorb large buy orders, potentially leading to more significant upward price action during periods of high demand. Conversely, a sudden decision by a large number of these dormant holders to sell could introduce a substantial amount of supply into the market, potentially leading to downward price pressure. However, the historical trend suggests that these holders are remarkably resilient, often choosing to hold even during significant downturns. Their inactivity acts as a constant removal of supply from the active market, underpinning Bitcoin’s scarcity narrative. This phenomenon is a key factor differentiating Bitcoin’s market behavior from traditional assets, where a much larger percentage of assets are actively traded, making the influence of Bitcoin market dynamics from dormant supply a critical analytical point. Mastering the Crypto HODL Strategy: Benefits and Challenges For many, the observation of this dormant supply validates the crypto HODL strategy . This approach, which involves holding onto cryptocurrency for extended periods regardless of price fluctuations, has proven to be incredibly lucrative for early adopters and those with a long-term vision. But what are the tangible benefits and inherent challenges? Benefits of a HODL Strategy: Compounding Gains: By holding through market cycles, investors can benefit from the long-term appreciation of Bitcoin, allowing their initial investment to grow exponentially. Reduced Stress and Emotional Trading: HODLing removes the temptation to make impulsive trading decisions based on short-term volatility, which often leads to losses. Tax Efficiency: In many jurisdictions, holding assets for longer periods can qualify for more favorable long-term capital gains tax rates. Alignment with Bitcoin’s Vision: It aligns investors with Bitcoin’s core narrative as a long-term store of value, rather than a speculative asset. Challenges of a HODL Strategy: Market Volatility: Enduring significant price drops (e.g., 80% corrections) requires immense psychological fortitude. Opportunity Cost: Funds are tied up, meaning they cannot be used for other investments or short-term gains. Psychological Temptation: The urge to sell during euphoric bull runs or panic during severe bear markets can be overwhelming. Security Risks: Long-term holding necessitates impeccable digital asset security to prevent loss or theft. Examples abound, from individuals who bought Bitcoin for a few dollars and are now millionaires, to companies like MicroStrategy that have adopted Bitcoin as their primary treasury reserve asset, demonstrating a corporate-level crypto HODL strategy . Ensuring Digital Asset Security for Long-Term Holdings The sheer volume of Bitcoin dormant supply also raises critical questions about digital asset security . How have these vast sums of Bitcoin remained safe and untouched for so long? The answer lies in robust security practices, primarily the use of cold storage solutions. Unlike hot wallets, which are connected to the internet, cold storage devices keep private keys offline, making them virtually impervious to online hacks. Key Security Measures for Long-Term Bitcoin Holders: Hardware Wallets: Devices like Ledger or Trezor store private keys offline, requiring physical confirmation for transactions. Multi-Signature Wallets: These require multiple private keys (held by different individuals or in different locations) to authorize a transaction, adding layers of security. Air-Gapped Computers: Using a computer never connected to the internet for generating and storing private keys. Seed Phrase Management: Securely backing up and protecting the recovery seed phrase, often on physically robust materials and in multiple secure locations. Inheritance Planning: Crucial for ensuring that assets can be accessed by beneficiaries in the event of the holder’s incapacitation or death. The recent movement of 14-year-old Bitcoin highlights that even after more than a decade, the security measures employed by these holders proved effective. However, the challenge of maintaining such high levels of digital asset security over extended periods is immense, requiring constant vigilance against evolving threats like sophisticated phishing attempts or even physical theft of storage devices. Beyond the Five-Year Mark: The Future Implications What does this vast Bitcoin dormant supply mean for Bitcoin’s future? If these coins remain dormant, they effectively reduce Bitcoin’s true circulating supply, enhancing its scarcity and reinforcing its narrative as ‘digital gold.’ This continued dormancy could contribute to higher price floors and less volatility in the long run, as fewer coins are available for speculative trading. However, the potential for these coins to eventually move remains a significant factor. While a sudden, massive sell-off could create market shock, it’s more likely that any movement would be gradual or for specific purposes, such as rebalancing portfolios, transferring to institutional custody, or even for philanthropic endeavors. The fact that the recent $8 billion transfer was picked up by exchanges suggests some intent to liquidate, but it represents a tiny fraction of the overall dormant supply. The long-term behavior of these holders will continue to be a fascinating aspect of Bitcoin’s journey, shaping its trajectory and cementing its status as a revolutionary digital asset. The phenomenon of Bitcoin dormant supply is more than just a statistic; it’s a testament to the unwavering belief of long-term Bitcoin holders in its future. It profoundly shapes Bitcoin market dynamics , underscores the power of the crypto HODL strategy , and highlights the critical importance of robust digital asset security . As Bitcoin continues its journey, the silent strength of its long-term holders will remain a foundational pillar, influencing its trajectory and cementing its status as a unique and revolutionary digital asset in the global financial landscape.

2025-07-05T06:10:45,"Altcoin Season Index at 24: Bitcoin’s Crucial Reign in the Crypto Market","BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season Index at 24: Bitcoin’s Crucial Reign in the Crypto Market Are you tracking the pulse of the cryptocurrency market? The latest update from CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index reveals a score of 24 as of July 5th, a clear signal that the market is currently experiencing Bitcoin Season . For many investors, this number is a crucial indicator of where capital is flowing and how different digital assets are performing. But what exactly does an index score of 24 signify for your portfolio and the broader crypto market trends ? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index : What Does 24 Mean? The Altcoin Season Index , meticulously tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), provides a snapshot of the market’s current state by evaluating the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin over the past 90 days. A score of 24, as recently reported, is a definitive indicator: we are not in Altcoin Season. For the market to be declared an ‘Altcoin Season,’ a staggering 75% or more of these top 100 altcoins must have outperformed Bitcoin within that 90-day window. Conversely, a score like 24 places us firmly in ‘Bitcoin Season,’ where 25% or fewer of these altcoins have managed to surpass Bitcoin’s performance. This index, ranging from 1 to 100, serves as a vital barometer for understanding the prevailing capital flows and investor sentiment across the digital asset landscape. Navigating Bitcoin Season : Why Dominance Matters When the Altcoin Season Index points to Bitcoin Season , it signifies a period where Bitcoin (BTC) is not just holding its own, but actively outperforming the vast majority of alternative cryptocurrencies. This dominance is not merely a statistical quirk; it reflects deeper underlying dynamics within the crypto market trends . Often, Bitcoin Season emerges during times of market uncertainty, where investors tend to flock to what they perceive as the safer, more established asset in the volatile crypto space. Bitcoin’s larger market capitalization, greater liquidity, and increasing institutional adoption contribute to its role as a ‘digital gold,’ making it a preferred haven. This period also often sees a consolidation of capital, with funds rotating out of smaller, riskier altcoins and into Bitcoin, further solidifying its lead. Analyzing Current Crypto Market Trends : Beyond the Index Score While the Altcoin Season Index provides a clear numerical value, understanding the current crypto market trends requires looking beyond just the score. Bitcoin Season is a recurring phenomenon in the cyclical nature of the cryptocurrency market. It often precedes or follows periods of intense altcoin speculation. During such times, the market’s attention and liquidity are heavily concentrated on Bitcoin, which can lead to a ‘cooling off’ period for many altcoins. This doesn’t necessarily mean altcoins are ‘dead,’ but rather that their individual altcoin performance may be subdued relative to Bitcoin. Key factors influencing these trends include global macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, and significant industry news. Investors often use Bitcoin’s performance as a bellwether for the overall health and direction of the crypto ecosystem. Impact on Your Altcoin Performance : Strategies for Investors For investors holding a diversified portfolio of digital assets, the current Bitcoin Season directly impacts your altcoin performance . Many altcoins may experience stagnation or even declines in their Bitcoin-denominated value, even if their USD value remains stable or slightly increases. This period can be challenging for those solely focused on rapid altcoin gains. However, it also presents unique opportunities for strategic cryptocurrency investing . Here are some considerations: Re-evaluate your portfolio: Is your risk exposure appropriate for a Bitcoin-dominant market? Consider rebalancing some positions towards Bitcoin if you believe its dominance will continue. Focus on fundamentals: This is an excellent time to research projects with strong technology, active development, clear use cases, and solid communities. Projects with genuine utility tend to fare better in bear or consolidation phases. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, consider regularly investing a fixed amount into promising altcoins. This strategy can help mitigate risk during volatile periods. Patience is key: Market cycles are a natural part of crypto. While Bitcoin may be leading now, history suggests that altcoin seasons eventually return. Strategic Cryptocurrency Investing in a Shifting Landscape Successfully navigating the current market demands a strategic approach to cryptocurrency investing . Understanding that the market operates in cycles—alternating between Bitcoin dominance and altcoin surges—is paramount. During Bitcoin Season, a conservative stance might be warranted for some, focusing on capital preservation. For others, it might be an opportune moment to accumulate undervalued altcoins at lower prices, anticipating their eventual resurgence when market sentiment shifts. Diversification remains a core principle, but the allocation within that diversification might need adjustment based on the prevailing market conditions indicated by metrics like the Altcoin Season Index . Always conduct thorough due diligence and never invest more than you can afford to lose. The Altcoin Season Index at 24 clearly signals that the cryptocurrency market is currently in a phase of Bitcoin dominance. While this may mean subdued altcoin performance in the short term, it offers valuable insights into prevailing crypto market trends . For those engaged in cryptocurrency investing , understanding these cycles and adapting strategies accordingly is crucial. Whether you’re rebalancing your portfolio, researching new projects, or simply holding through the current climate, staying informed about key metrics like the Altcoin Season Index empowers you to make more informed decisions in this dynamic digital landscape.

2025-07-05T06:00:43,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Decoding Market Sentiment’s Powerful Grip","BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Decoding Market Sentiment’s Powerful Grip Are you tracking the pulse of the cryptocurrency market? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a crucial barometer for investor sentiment, recently registered 67 on July 5th, a slight dip from the previous day but still firmly entrenched in the ‘Greed’ zone. For seasoned investors and curious newcomers alike, understanding this index is like having a compass in the often-turbulent seas of crypto. But what does this ‘Greed’ signal truly mean for your digital assets, and how can you leverage this insight to make smarter decisions? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: A Deep Dive into Market Sentiment At its core, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , provided by Alternative, is designed to distill the complex emotions driving the cryptocurrency market into a single, digestible number. Ranging from 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed), it offers a snapshot of whether market participants are feeling overly anxious or excessively exuberant. This index isn’t just a random number; it’s a sophisticated aggregation of various data points, aiming to capture the collective psychological state of crypto investors. Why is this important? Because emotions, particularly fear and greed, are powerful forces in financial markets. When fear dominates, investors tend to panic sell, often at a loss. Conversely, when greed takes over, it can lead to irrational exuberance, inflated prices, and eventually, market corrections. The index serves as a potential contrarian indicator: extreme fear might signal a buying opportunity, while extreme greed could suggest it’s time to exercise caution. The Six Pillars of the Index: What Drives the Numbers? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t a simple survey; it’s a weighted average of six distinct factors, each contributing to the overall score. Let’s break down these components to truly understand what influences the Crypto Market Sentiment : Volatility (25%): This factor measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average values over the last 30 and 90 days. High volatility, especially sudden downward movements, often indicates fear in the market. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This component analyzes the current trading volume and market momentum, comparing it with average values over the last 30 and 90 days. High buying volume in a rising market suggests strong positive momentum and potentially greed. Social Media (15%): The index scans various social media platforms, particularly Twitter, for crypto-related hashtags and analyzes the sentiment of posts. A high volume of positive, excited mentions can point towards increasing greed. Surveys (15%): While currently paused, this factor historically involved weekly polls asking investors about their market outlook. These surveys provided direct insights into investor confidence. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Bitcoin Dominance refers to Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. An increasing Bitcoin dominance often indicates that investors are moving from altcoins to Bitcoin, which is seen as a safer haven during uncertain times (fear), or that Bitcoin is leading a bull run (greed, but more focused). Google Trends (10%): This factor analyzes search queries related to cryptocurrencies on Google Trends. A surge in searches for terms like ‘Bitcoin price manipulation’ or ‘crypto crash’ might indicate fear, while terms like ‘how to buy crypto’ or ‘Bitcoin halving’ during a bull run could signal growing public interest and greed. The weighting of these factors highlights their perceived importance in gauging overall market sentiment. It’s a holistic approach, moving beyond just price action to include the underlying psychological currents. Navigating the ‘Greed Zone’: What Does a 67 Mean for Your Investments? With the index at 67, we are firmly in the ‘Greed’ zone. But what does this imply for you as an investor? Being in the Greed Zone suggests that investors are becoming overly optimistic, potentially leading to inflated prices due to Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO). Here’s what it typically signifies: Increased FOMO: Many investors might be rushing to buy, fearing they’ll miss out on further price increases. This can drive prices up unsustainably. Higher Risk: As prices climb on the back of speculative buying, the market becomes more vulnerable to sudden corrections. The risk of buying at a local top increases. Potential for Profit-Taking: Experienced traders often view the ‘Greed’ zone as a signal to consider taking some profits off the table, especially if they entered positions during periods of fear. It’s crucial to remember that the index is a sentiment tool, not a crystal ball. A high ‘Greed’ reading doesn’t guarantee an immediate crash, just as ‘Fear’ doesn’t guarantee an immediate rally. However, it serves as a powerful reminder to approach the market with a degree of caution and to re-evaluate your investment strategy. Challenges and Limitations: Why Market Volatility Isn’t the Only Factor While incredibly useful, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t without its limitations. Relying solely on this index for investment decisions can be perilous. For instance, while Market Volatility is a significant component, it’s just one piece of a much larger puzzle. Other factors to consider include: Aspect Description Relevance to Index Economic Indicators Inflation rates, interest rates, global economic stability. Indirectly impacts overall investor confidence, which can influence crypto sentiment. Regulatory News New laws, bans, or approvals for cryptocurrencies. Directly impacts market sentiment, sometimes overriding index signals. Technological Developments Upgrades to blockchain networks, new dApps, scaling solutions. Can drive long-term value and sentiment, not fully captured by short-term sentiment metrics. Whale Movements Large transactions by institutional investors or major holders. Can significantly influence price and sentiment, often before the index fully reflects it. The index is most effective when used as a complementary tool alongside technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and a thorough understanding of macroeconomic trends. It’s a sentiment gauge, not a definitive buy or sell signal. Unlocking Insights: How to Leverage the Crypto Fear & Greed Index for Better Decisions So, how can you effectively integrate the Crypto Fear & Greed Index into your investment strategy? Here are some actionable insights: Contrarian Thinking: The classic advice is to be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful. When the index is extremely low (0-20), it might be a good time to accumulate assets, assuming your fundamental analysis supports the investment. When it’s extremely high (80-100), consider reducing exposure or taking profits. Risk Management: A high ‘Greed’ score should prompt you to review your portfolio’s risk exposure. Are you over-allocated to volatile assets? This might be a good time to rebalance. Patience and Discipline: Don’t let the index dictate impulsive decisions. Use it as a prompt for deeper analysis. If the index is high, ask yourself: Is this asset truly undervalued, or am I just feeling FOMO? Trend Confirmation: Observe the trend of the index. Is it steadily rising into greed, or has it just spiked? A rapid change can be more indicative of a short-term emotional swing than a sustained trend. Remember, successful investing in crypto, or any market, is about making informed, rational decisions, not emotional ones. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index helps you identify when emotions are running high, giving you an edge to act more rationally than the crowd. Conclusion: Your Compass in the Crypto Storm The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , currently hovering at 67 in the ‘Greed’ zone, offers invaluable insight into the prevailing sentiment of the cryptocurrency market. By deconstructing its components—from market momentum and social media buzz to Bitcoin Dominance and Google Trends—we gain a deeper appreciation for the complex interplay of factors that shape investor psychology. While it’s a powerful tool for gauging market sentiment and acting as a potential contrarian indicator, it’s not a standalone solution. Instead, it serves as an essential compass, guiding you to exercise caution when exuberance peaks and to consider opportunities when fear reigns supreme. By understanding and strategically utilizing this index alongside other analytical tools, you can navigate the dynamic crypto landscape with greater confidence and make more informed investment choices.
