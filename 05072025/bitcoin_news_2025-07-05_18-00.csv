2025-07-05T15:58:21,"Ethereum Price Prediction 2025 Shows Gains, But Bitcoin Solaris Presale Investors Could See Fortune-Building Returns Sooner","Ethereum remains one of crypto’s strongest assets — but its trajectory requires time. Most 2025 forecasts show 2x to 4x gains depending on network adoption, ETF momentum, and Layer-2 integrations. For investors looking to beat those timelines and access Bitcoin-level wealth mechanics, Bitcoin Solaris is drawing serious attention. Now in phase 10 of its presale, Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is priced at $10 with a confirmed $20 exchange listing already locked in. The difference? It’s not just a promise. Over 11,500 users are already involved. Over $5 million in presale funding has come in. And the systems that drive the token economy are either live or in advanced development. Smartphone Mining and High-Speed Architecture One of the primary reasons investors are shifting focus to BTC-S is accessibility. With the Nova App, users contribute to blockchain validation directly from their smartphones using idle CPU and storage. No staking, no infrastructure — just protocol-level integration that earns BTC-S in return. This is made possible by a hybrid architecture. Bitcoin Solaris uses Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Capacity at the base layer, while the Solaris Layer adds Delegated Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Time. That combination allows for 10,000 transactions per second with 2-second finality — and an energy profile that’s 99.95% more efficient than Bitcoin. Tokenomics That Mirror Bitcoin — Not Ethereum Ethereum’s supply is elastic. It burns fees, adjusts emissions, and reacts to market variables. Bitcoin Solaris offers a simpler proposition: 21 million tokens total, 4.2 million are available during presale. BTC-S is priced at $10 now. The launch price is set at $20. That’s more than 120% upside already confirmed—and that doesn’t factor in market demand or token velocity once listings go live. The presale ends July 31, and entry at this phase remains open to the public. As highlighted in a recent Crypto Vlog analysis , “Bitcoin Solaris is where smart money is moving. Not for hype — but for returns tied to actual usage.” Audits, Verifications, and Active Development Unlike most presale tokens, Bitcoin Solaris is already delivering. Cyberscope has completed its smart contract audit . Freshcoins audited the Nova App logic . The team is fully KYC-verified . And development isn’t waiting on listings. Development is advancing on multiple fronts. The Mining Power Marketplace — where users will be able to rent or monetize computing power using BTC-S — is actively under construction. Wallet enhancements are in progress to support broader functionality. A public testnet and full developer suite are on the roadmap for release in the near term. Ethereum will continue to grow. But Bitcoin Solaris is the only sub-$10 token on track to deliver network-driven returns before its first listing. The time window for entry is narrow — and this presale is one of the last confirmed steps before the token moves into full circulation.

2025-07-05T15:53:13,"Solana ETF with Staking Feature Debuts, Attracting $12 Million","The first Solana-based ETF with staking capabilities, the REX-Osprey Solana Staking ETF (SSK), has launched in the United States, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. On its first day of trading on the CBOE BZX exchange, SSK attracted $12 million in inflows with a total trading volume of $33 million. The fund offers investors direct exposure to spot Solana as well as access to staking yields. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffarth described the trading debut as “healthy,” noting that $8 million in volume was recorded within the first 20 minutes. Balchunas further noted that SSK’s launch significantly outperformed the initial trading of Solana and XRP futures ETFs, although it was surpassed by the debut of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum funds. Regulatory Highlights The fund is structured under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which allows it to bypass the standard Form 19b-4 filing process typically required for spot ETFs. Nate Geraci, President of NovaDius Wealth Management, described this approach as a “regulatory workaround.” Anchorage Digital serves as both the staking and custody partner for SSK. Growing Institutional Interest The launch of SSK coincided with a surge in institutional interest in Solana. Open interest in Solana futures on the CME reached a record $167 million, signaling increased attention from institutional investors. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US have returned to positive capital inflows. Over the course of two days, investors poured more than $1 billion into these funds, offsetting a previous outflow of $342.2 million. On July 2, net inflows totaled $407.8 million, followed by $601.8 million the next day. Fidelity’s FBTC fund led the way, attracting $184 million and $237.1 million on those respective days. BlackRock’s IBIT fund also saw strong interest, raising $224.5 million on July 3 after two days of zero flows.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9818/solana-etf-with-staking-feature-debuts-attracting-12-million,"SOL|TRADING|BUSINESS|BTC|ETH","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

According to the newly updated settlement portal, General Motors will provide compensation to affected owners and lessees for issues related to excessive oil consumption in vehicles equipped with LC9 engines. The payout will go to customers in California, Idaho and North Carolina. The lawsuit alleges GM was aware of a defect triggered by excessively worn piston rings, which leads to excessive oil consumption, spark plug fouling, rough idling, rough acceleration, check engine light activation, engine shutdown commands, oil loss and potentially permanent engine damage or shutdown. Although GM has decided to settle, the company firmly denies any wrongdoing or liability and rejects the notion that any vehicles connected to the case are defective. The lawsuit alleges certain 2011 through 2014 models are defective, including Chevrolet Avalanche, Chevrolet Silverado, Chevrolet Suburban, Chevrolet Tahoe, GMC Sierra, GMC Yukon and GMC Yukon XL. Eligible owners or lessees may automatically receive a pro rata payment estimated at a minimum of $2,149).

2025-07-05T15:30:43,"Crypto Market Cap On Track To $4.5 Trillion As Q3 Unfolds – Details","Popular market analyst and key opinion leader (KOL) Ted Pillows is projecting the crypto market to hit a $4.5 trillion valuation before Q3 2025 ends. This interestingly bullish forecast comes off the back of another Bitcoin price rejection allowing the total crypto market cap to maintain the choppy price movement seen in the last month. Related Reading: Bitcoin Near Historic Weekly Close Despite Drop – Analyst Warns Of Volatile Weekend Rally Ahead? Crypto Market Tests $3.5T Barrier In an X post on July 4, Pillows shares an insightful technical analysis on the total crypto market cap. Using the daily CryptoCap chart from Tradingview, the renowned analyst highlights the recent formation of a bull flag hinting at an impending price breakout. For context, the bull flag is a classic bullish continuation pattern. It starts with the formation of a flagpole i.e. a strong upward price movement, as seen between early April to late May when Bitcoin reached a new all-time high. This structure is followed by the “flag,” i.e., a descending price channel that reflects a period of consolidation. This market action is seen from late May to the present, as the crypto market cap entered a temporary pullback phase. Pillows’ analysis shows a complete bull flag formation. However, the crypto market cap must achieve a decisive price close above the $3.5 trillion mark which represents the upper boundary of the flag to confirm a price breakout. If this bullish scenario occurs, Ted Pillows predicts the crypto total market cap to surge to around $4.3 trillion – $4.5 trillion in Q3 2025. Considering its market dominance levels of 62.77%, Bitcoin’s market cap could also rise to around $2.82 trillion in such bullish conditions providing a market price of $141,800 per unit. However, it’s worth noting that the occurrence of an altseason amidst this crypto price surge could alter the projected market status for the premier cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Ethereum Approaches Wyckoff ‘Liftoff’ Phase – Can ETH Reach A New High?

However, the ongoing crypto bull run has delivered an impressive 51.24% gain over the past year. The market leader, Bitcoin, is presently valued at $108,118 reflecting a 1.46% loss in the last 24 hours as previously stated. The maiden cryptocurrency is also witnessing a 14.40% fall in daily trading volume indicating crash in transactions and market activity.

Is Litecoin a good investment? Litecoin is an alternative to Bitcoin, making it an appealing choice for everyday transactions worldwide. Additionally, with a finite cap of 84 million coins, LTC presents itself as a potential investment for value preservation, akin to Bitcoin’s role as a digital asset. Why is the LTC price down today?

According to our Litecoin price prediction, the LTC price might hit the $500 mark in 2028. However, this rally depends on the future buying interest in the altcoin market. Does LTC have a good long-term future? Despite the recent adjustments and potential peak formation, Litecoin exhibits a robust long-term price trajectory and outlook, indicating a high potential for future growth. If the network continues to witness robust activities and growth, the price might reach $1000 in no time. Recent news/opinion on Litecoin The U.S. SEC has postponed its decision on Canary Funds’ plan to launch a spot Litecoin (LTC) ETF. It’s now asking the public to share thoughts on whether the ETF can help stop fraud and manipulation. Litecoin price prediction July 2025 Litecoin’s price shows signs of bullish moves as it has been surging toward $100. However, as BTC’s price aims for a hold above the $110K mark in July, Litecoin’s price intends to end this month on a bullish note.

2025-07-05T15:25:29,"Veteran Trader to XRP Holders: You Are Not Bullish Enough. Here’s Why","Veteran crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto has sparked renewed optimism in the XRP community with a bold assertion: “You are not bullish enough.” In a recent post on X, CrediBULL pointed to XRP’s strong and sustained technical positioning as evidence that most traders are drastically underestimating what could be a massive upcoming move. With XRP now entering its eighth consecutive month of consolidation above a key historical level, his statement has struck a chord across the crypto space. A Clean, Impulsive Rally from $0.50 CrediBULL highlights a critical detail that sets XRP apart from nearly every altcoin in the market: its clear and impulsive price action since rebounding from the $0.50 level. In technical terms, an impulsive move is the beginning of a strong bullish trend, often serving as the first leg of a multi-wave rally. According to CrediBULL, XRP and Bitcoin are currently the only major coins exhibiting such clean impulsive structures , a rare and powerful signal in a market often dominated by erratic volatility. Aside from being one of the only coins in this entire market with the clearest/cleanest impulsive PA (aside from $BTC ) starting at it's launch off of .50, $XRP is currently going on it's EIGHTH month of consolidation above the prior ATH monthly close. You Are Not … https://t.co/sM4zJgK378 pic.twitter.com/EucpQZVaLF — CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) July 5, 2025 Since breaking above $0.50, XRP has demonstrated disciplined, wave-based movements that suggest accumulation rather than speculation. This behavior is not just bullish, it’s foundational. It means smart money could be quietly positioning ahead of a major breakout that retail investors have yet to fully price in. Consolidating Above a Major Historical Benchmark Perhaps even more telling than its wave structure is XRP’s current location on the chart. The asset has now spent eight months consolidating above its previous all-time high (ATH) monthly close, a level that capped XRP’s price in the 2017 bull run and again during much of the 2020–2021 cycle. In the world of technical analysis, this kind of sustained price action above a former ATH monthly close is highly significant. It signals that the market has re-evaluated the asset, converting long-standing resistance into solid support. For XRP, which has faced regulatory pressure and years of suppressed price action, this prolonged consolidation suggests a coiled spring preparing for release. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Why Traders Are Still Underestimating XRP Despite all of this, sentiment around XRP remains curiously subdued. Many traders remain skeptical, possibly due to the coin’s long and frustrating legal battle with the SEC. But with that case moving close to fresolution, the fundamental picture for XRP has never been clearer. CrediBULL argues that this sentiment lag is precisely what makes the current setup so powerful. While most of the market looks elsewhere, XRP has quietly built a base above a critical level, supported by a clean price structure and strengthening fundamentals, including Ripple’s expanding global reach, the integration of RLUSD, and regulatory clarity in key jurisdictions. Final Thoughts CrediBULL Crypto’s message is clear: XRP holders may be significantly underestimating what lies ahead. With technicals, sentiment, and fundamentals aligning, XRP is positioned for a potential breakout of historic proportions. For those still sitting on the sidelines or doubting the setup, the veteran trader’s warning couldn’t be more timely, this may be the calm before an explosive storm.

2025-07-05T15:20:00,"Crypto dips after Fed Powell remain mute on rate cuts, but this altcoin remains strong","Bitcoin is tumbling below $106,000, shaking confidence across the crypto market. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s silence on rate cut timing is fueling unease. Tensions with President Trump, who demands lower rates, are intensifying the slide. Bitcoin lost 2.47% in two days, hovering at $106,998. Other tokens are also struggling. Yet, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is standing tall in its presale phase. Investors are rushing to this DeFi project, which has raised $11,700,000 and sold over 580 million tokens to 12,700 holders. Its resilience is turning heads. As the crypto market falters, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) shines with strong fundamentals. Powell remains mute on rate cuts Jerome Powell is staying tight-lipped on when rate cuts might happen. At a recent Portugal conference, he stressed decisions hinge on economic data, offering no timeline. This ambiguity, coupled with Trump’s tariff policies, is fueling inflation fears, pushing Bitcoin down 1.3% to $105,859. Powell’s cautious approach is keeping markets on edge. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is unfazed, gaining traction with its presale. This contrast highlights MUTM’s appeal as a top crypto to buy now. Investors are eyeing its stability amid uncertainty. Mutuum Finance presale surges forward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is powering through Phase 5 of its 11-phase presale. The current price is $0.03, up 200% from the $0.01 starting point. Over 60% of Phase 5 is filled, meaning time to buy at this price is running out. Phase 6 will raise the price 16.7% to $0.035. With a launch price set at $0.06, buyers now lock in a 100% return. Analysts predict a $2.50 post-launch value in 2025, promising significant gains. This makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a top crypto to buy now. Furthermore, its utility-driven model outshines speculative coins in today’s crypto market. DeFi lending with real utility Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is transforming decentralized lending with a dual system. Its Peer-to-Contract model uses smart contracts for dynamic, market-based interest rates. This creates stability for users. The Peer-to-Peer option allows direct lending, perfect for volatile assets. Users keep full control, boosting security. Additionally, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum. Fully collateralized, it avoids depegging risks, unlike algorithmic coins. This practical approach appeals to investors seeking the best crypto to buy now. The platform’s transparency and flexibility set it apart. Consequently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction in a turbulent crypto market.

2025-07-05T15:15:14,"Why Remittix’s Unique PayFi Offering Has Cardano & XRP Whales Circling After $15 Million Is Raised!","The post Why Remittix’s Unique PayFi Offering Has Cardano & XRP Whales Circling After $15 Million Is Raised! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Remittix is quickly gaining ground as a serious crypto player, especially after raising over $15.9 million. Cardano and XRP whales are now taking notice, as the project’s PayFi innovation opens up an entirely new world for real-world crypto adoption. What Makes PayFi Stand Out From ADA & XRP Remittix’s PayFi allows crypto holders to move BTC, ETH or XRP to traditional bank accounts in four and a half minutes. That bridge to the physical world is what XRP and Cardano have been reaching for, but Remittix seems to be there first. Cardano is trading at $0.5761, down by 4.12% with volume down by 50.24%. XRP also fell by 2.37% to $2.21, volume down 54.2%. The two cryptocurrencies have long touted mass adoption with seamless payments but now are at risk of being displaced by a leaner and faster model. Remittix, for its part, is already conducting full wallet flight testing and hopes to formally launch in Q3 2025. Why Whales Are Taking Remittix Seriously Whales prefer to track utility not buzz. And Remittix has aplenty. With over 547 million tokens already sold, an active presale at $0.0811 and an active 50% token bonus, large investors are considering gigantic upside potential. The project is seeking an $18M soft cap and having already received $15.9M+, it’s close to reaching that goal in a hurry. But what really makes it stand out is that it doesn’t merely guarantee cross-border payments, it does them. Whereas Cardano’s ongoing-building ecosystem or XRP’s perpetual fight against regulations, Remittix is giving consumers an instant use case anybody can comprehend: send crypto, get fiat. Can Remittix Catch Up with XRP And Cardano? If trends continue the way they are, it might. The demand for fast, efficient and global payment systems is growing rapidly. XRP and ADA helped create the early narrative on crypto utility and Remittix is turning that utility into reality with minimal friction. Remittix’s whitepaper has goals for global expansion and its product is already in functional test stages. That’s greater than several layer-1s or cross-border coins in the same tier. Investors are now wondering: if Remittix can do in one click what XRP and ADA have only dreamed about, why risk being short on the newer project? A Real Chance At The Top 10? Remittix isn’t some pretty-looking site coin. It’s a full payment system with real-world usage. By touching upon the crossroads between crypto and fiat, it’s addressing one of the biggest problems in crypto adoption today. As PayFi continues to gain steam and as whales continue to pour in, Remittix could threaten the very foundations that ADA and XRP were established on. If it continues to gain strength on this trajectory throughout Q3 and onwards, it would not be so surprising for Remittix (RTX) to climb into the top 10 crypto rankings.

Analysts note that since breaking above the $0.50 level, it has shown one of the strongest and clearest uptrends. Among major cryptocurrencies, only Bitcoin displays a more established and solid market structure. The monthly XRP chart is quietly showing strength. Historically, the $1.90–$2.00 zone has served as a key resistance level. But in 2024, XRP decisively broke above $2 and since then, the price has stabilized and is holding steady above it. Aside from being one of the only coins in this entire market with the clearest/cleanest impulsive PA (aside from $BTC ) starting at it's launch off of .50, $XRP is currently going on it's EIGHTH month of consolidation above the prior ATH monthly close. You Are Not … https://t.co/sM4zJgK378 pic.twitter.com/EucpQZVaLF — CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) July 5, 2025 Analyst Predicts Bitcoin to Surge Beyond $30 XRP has firmly remained above the $1.90 mark for more than eight consecutive months. With price holding steady and low volatility, the pressure is building. When assets move like this, major breakouts often follow. According to Elliott Wave theory , XRP is all set to enter a strong upward trend. This means that we could see the price rise through five distinct waves, pushing it beyond $30 by mid-2026. Multiple Drivers Behind XRP’s Growth Analys t Vincent Code also predicts that XRP could hit $30–$50. He cited several reasons for XRP’s rise. RippleNet could capture 20–30% of the $1 trillion cross-border payments market. More than 50 countries may adopt XRP for CBDC bridges. A big crypto bull run in 2026–2027 could spark strong market excitement. Demand for RLUSD is also growing. Further, Ripple’s 2024 agreement with Saudi Arabia’s central bank could pave the way for XRP to be used in oil-related settlements. He also expects that an XRP Spot ETF approval could bring $20–$50 billion in institutional investments. Analyst MelarinX says that XRP is coiling like a spring and quietly building energy before a big breakout. Davinci Jeremie , a Bitcoin proponent has also made a U-turn and predicted that XRP could possibly hit $24 this year. He cited that many people in the US government are “pushing for XRP.” XRP at a Crucial Price Crossroad XRP is currently trading at $2.23. It is stuck in a tight range, and key moving averages are closing in. This kind of setup often comes before a big, sudden move. Both upward and downward moves are possible. Nevertheless, XRP’s strong bullish setup and the growing institutional interest, like Ripple’s U.S. bank license bid and ETF talks, are keeping the long-term optimism alive.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrps-tight-range-signals-imminent-move-experts-predict-major-breakout/,"XRP|TRADING|MARKET|BTC|FIAT","News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare
2025-07-05T15:06:21,"Bitcoin (BTC) breakout delayed: Will it still happen?","Bitcoin (BTC) rose out of its bull flag on Thursday, and for all intents and purposes looked as though it might be able to consolidate above. However, the bears had other ideas, and not only forced the price back to the upper trendline, but drove it back inside the flag. Is this just a postponement of the breakout, or could the price be brought lower still? Is $BTC going to break out or not? Source: TradingView The short-term chart for $BTC shows a fakeout of the bull flag. When the price was over $110,000 on Thursday this was probably the last thing that the bulls expected. That said, $BTC was becoming overbought, and once the first breakout confirmation had been made, and the price rolled over again, the bulls suddenly lost their nerve and the price receded back into the bull flag. One further bearish factor that will give the bulls food for thought is that the surge out of the bull flag did not put in a higher high. It got pretty close, but pretty close still isn’t a higher high. On the more positive side of things, the overbought condition for $BTC is resetting as the Stochastic RSI indicators on the 4-hour time frame have now hit the bottom. Having said that, the 8-hour and 12-hour Stochastic RSIs still have a way to go, and might even start turning up before they get to the bottom. $106,000 important level to hold Source: TradingView The daily chart reveals that the price is still above the $106,000 support. This is an important level because it marks the top of some candle bodies from December 2024 through to January 2025. If this level continues to hold, the breakout and fakeout of the bull flag could just be a momentary setback. Weekly close crucial for deciding next week’s price direction Source: TradingView The 4 of July holiday in the United States may have had something to do with the lacklustre trading of $BTC on Friday. Be that as it may, looking at the macro picture, the surge out of the falling wedge pattern has turned into a classic bull flag, and it might be expected that this plays out to the upside, even if it does take a while longer. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI indicators are still sitting on a knife edge. Any positive or negative price action over this weekend could tip the scales in either direction. The ideal situation for the bulls would be for a confirmed cross back up at the end of Sunday. If this doesn’t take place, expect at least another week of sideways price action.

2025-07-05T14:30:09,"US Bond Holders Abruptly Dump ~$11,000,000,000 in Treasuries and Corporate Debt Amid Fears of US Fiscal Fallout: Report","Investors are selling billions of dollars of US bonds in a dramatic turnaround signaling fears over America’s fiscal future, according to a new report. Nearly $11 billion in long-term bonds and corporate debt has been dumped in just three months, reports the Financial Times. The Q2 2025 selloff ends a five year run of net inflows into long-term US bond funds, with the previous selloff happening back in the first quarter of 2020. PGIM’s top fixed income strategist Robert Tipp says the shift shows investors are wary of rising inflation and increasing government debt. “It’s a volatile environment, with inflation still above target and heavy government supply as far as the eye can see. This is driving a skittishness about the long end of the yield curve, and a general uneasiness.” The news comes amid the passing of President Trump’s “big beautiful” spending bill, which raises the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, extends 2017 tax cuts permanently, boosts spending on defense and border security, cuts parts of Medicaid and SNAP programs, eliminates clean energy tax credits, and introduces tax exemptions for tips and overtime. Although the impact of the legislation is highly contested by the Trump administration, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates the bill will add approximately $3.5 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says he believes the bill will ignite unprecedented economic growth and offset the deficit through increased revenue, while establishing the US as the global leader in manufacturing and job creation.

2025-07-05T14:29:24,"Grayscale Reacts to SEC Action On XRP ETF","Grayscale Investments has responded to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) sudden decision to delay the launch of its Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) as an exchange-traded fund (ETF), describing the move as unexpected and indicative of a rapidly evolving regulatory climate. The announcement came in an email to Decrypt on Thursday, sparking broader conversations about the SEC’s shifting stance on crypto investment products, particularly those involving XRP. SEC Pauses GDLC ETF Launch Despite Early Approval The SEC initially fast-tracked Grayscale’s application to convert its GDLC product into a spot ETF. The fund, which primarily focuses on Bitcoin, also provides diversified exposure to Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Cardano. While the regulator had previously moved swiftly in greenlighting the conversion process, it halted progress just before allowing the ETF to begin trading. Grayscale called the move surprising but framed it as part of a broader pattern. “While this development was not anticipated, it highlights the dynamic nature of the regulatory landscape for first-of-its-kind products like GDLC,” the company said. GDLC: A Diversified Crypto Investment Vehicle The GDLC fund is modeled on the CoinDesk 5 Index, which tracks the performance of the five largest and most liquid cryptocurrencies. According to the SEC filing, GDLC’s holdings include over 80% in Bitcoin, 11% in Ethereum, 4.8% in XRP, 2.8% in Solana, and 0.8% in Cardano. By offering investors a single product that spreads exposure across top-tier digital assets, GDLC aims to simplify access to the crypto market. The planned ETF listing was set to bring added liquidity and market efficiency compared to the original closed-end structure. Grayscale Vows to Push Forward Despite the regulatory holdup, Grayscale reaffirmed its commitment to listing GDLC as a full-fledged ETF. “We are actively working with key stakeholders to meet all requirements,” the firm said, promising to keep the public updated as new information becomes available. Grayscale has already successfully converted both its Bitcoin and Ethereum trusts into ETFs. These conversions helped solve pricing inefficiencies caused by their closed-end fund structures, which often led to significant discounts or premiums. SEC’s Evolving Approach to Crypto ETFs The SEC’s decision underscores its cautious yet shifting attitude toward crypto ETFs. While the agency now appears more receptive to funds centered on major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, it continues to withhold approval for ETFs that focus solely on mid-cap coins like XRP, Solana, or Cardano. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Instead, the regulator has shown greater openness to diversified funds that include a mix of these altcoins, provided Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the dominant components. This nuanced approach suggests that while XRP isn’t off-limits, it still carries regulatory uncertainty when standing alone. Court Battle with the SEC Set the Stage Grayscale’s ongoing pursuit of ETF approval comes on the heels of a major legal victory against the SEC in 2023. After several rejections, Grayscale sued the agency, and a U.S. appellate court ruled in its favor, criticizing the SEC’s inconsistent reasoning when approving futures-based ETFs but denying spot products. That legal win was instrumental in forcing the SEC to revisit its position and ultimately approve spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have since attracted nearly $50 billion in inflows. Spot Ethereum ETFs followed suit, pulling in around $4 billion to date. What It Means for XRP and the Road Ahead Although XRP remains a small component of GDLC, the SEC’s refusal to greenlight the fund’s launch highlights the lingering regulatory headwinds surrounding the asset. The decision doesn’t amount to an outright rejection of XRP in ETFs, but it does reflect the SEC’s reluctance to move forward with products that heavily emphasize altcoins outside Bitcoin and Ethereum. For now, Grayscale remains undeterred. The firm sees GDLC as a milestone product—one that could shape the future of crypto exposure in traditional finance. As regulatory signals continue to shift, the industry will be watching closely to see whether XRP, and altcoins like it, will eventually gain equal footing in the ETF space.

In a Saturday X post , the exchange apologized for its mishap, conceding that its compliance and risk systems still grapple with false positives and operational shortcomings. The exchange, however, claimed it is working to improve its risk control processes promptly. OKX says it performs checks on its employees as well In its X post, OKX also detailed the necessity of its compliance and risk control systems and what they mean for users. It explained that the processes are vital to ensure the platform remains free from illicit use and meets the required compliance laws. The exchange also asserted that it vets its staff and upholds a zero-tolerance stance on misconduct, including spreading disinformation, engaging in insider activities, or undermining user rights. It added that it has several internal monitoring checks to help spot infractions and take action promptly. For its clients, the exchange stated that its systems perform identity verification (KYC checks), monitor transactions, screen against sanctions lists, and detect potential market manipulation. It also incorporates third-party databases with proprietary behavioral models to help identify suspicious or risky accounts. Should an account be verified to have breached legal requirements or user agreements, the exchange responds by issuing notices, requesting additional information, suspending certain features, or closing the account permanently. However, if a user’s account is tied to sanctions or terrorism, the exchange will freeze their assets. OKX acknowledges false positives and asks users not to worry The exchange, however, revealed that its compliance and risk control systems are not 100% accurate, having flagged several normal users as risky. The exchange argued that many service providers typically use an aggressive play in identification checks, driven partly by regulatory guidance recommending prudence in risk oversight. As a result, even fully compliant users with normal activity may occasionally receive additional information requests from the compliance team. The notice also claimed that platforms evaluate customer risk levels on multiple factors. If one’s account is found to be high risk, more investigation into where the funds originate is conducted. The exchange, nevertheless, acknowledged that false positives are an issue in any compliance system. It further commented, “We are continuously improving the user experience for submitting documents after triggering risk controls. If you are asked to provide information such as the source of funds, proof of address, or past employment details, please don’t worry—just submit the information truthfully.” It also assured users that as long as they are not involved in any criminal activity, their account and funds will not be affected, and the platform is still obligated to protect their privacy. One X user, however, accused OKX of maliciously freezing user account funds and excessively collecting user privacy information. He explained that the exchange had asked for more information multiple times and even froze about 10,000 USDT in his account. He claimed he contacted the platform’s customer service and submitted tickets, which led to more inquiries about his work history and residential addresses. From his experience, he concluded that the exchange only wanted to trouble its consumers, saying it should be a wake-up call to everyone. He claimed the exchange starts by asking for additional info and then moves on to ask for more repeatedly before eventually freezing your account and rejecting your application.

2025-07-05T13:32:45,"XRP to ‘trigger a major move’ if this level is breached","As the price of XRP experiences notable volatility around the $2.20 mark, technical indicators suggest that a move above this level could trigger a significant rally. To this end, cryptocurrency trading expert Ali Martinez has identified the $2.38 mark as the key barrier preventing XRP from a major breakout, according to a July 4 post on X. Martinez arrived at this target by analyzing XRP’s UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) chart, which shows $2.38 as the highest concentration of previously transacted XRP, representing over 2.75 billion tokens, or 4.33% of the total supply. XRP URPD chart. Source: Glassnode The URPD metric, which tracks the price levels where tokens were last moved, indicates strong resistance at $2.38, as many holders may look to sell or break even at that point. However, the analyst believes a decisive break above $2.38 could “trigger a major move” by clearing both psychological and technical resistance levels. Such a breakout would invalidate significant overhead supply and potentially usher in renewed bullish momentum. Martinez also noted strong support between $0.50 and $1.80, particularly below the $1 level. Still, the key challenge remains the $2.38 zone, which has remained untested since XRP’s all-time highs. XRP price in consolidation Meanwhile, analyst CrediBULL Crypto emphasized XRP’s potential for a breakout in a July 5 X post. He pointed out that XRP is entering its eighth consecutive month of consolidation above its previous all-time high monthly close, an important technical milestone. This sustained price action above a former resistance-turned-support area signals growing strength and maturity. Aside from being one of the only coins in this entire market with the clearest/cleanest impulsive PA (aside from $BTC ) starting at it's launch off of .50, $XRP is currently going on it's EIGHTH month of consolidation above the prior ATH monthly close.

If confirmed, it could mark a new bullish impulse, further cementing XRP’s status as one of the most technically resilient digital assets.

Insider Credentials Sold for $2,700 According to Brazilian newspaper São Paulo, the attack began when a C&M employee exchanged their login credentials for approximately $2,700. The credentials granted the attackers entry into the systems of C&M, which link the Central Bank with domestic banks. The hackers targeted six institutions and withdrew cash from reserve accounts. One C&M employee suspected of making the breach possible through selling their access credentials has been detained by Brazilian police. $30M–$40M Cleaned via Crypto Blockchain analyst ZachXBT reported that the hackers instantly moved $30 million to $40 million to Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and USDt (USDT). Those assets were cleaned via Latin American crypto exchanges and over-the-counter (OTC) desks. The use of crypto for laundering is pointing towards increasing overlap among traditional finance systems and blockchain-based technologies in cybercrime operations. Centralized Systems Susceptible to AI-Era Threats The breach is a wake-up call to growing fear surrounding centralized software networks . Professionals say such networks are vulnerable to insider threats, ransomware, and exploits — particularly in a world where AI tools can be leveraged by cybercriminals to help them identify and breach such networks. Shielded Technologies CEO Eran Barak explained that hackers view centralized platforms as “massive ROI targets” due to the quantity of sensitive data and money that they hold. Decentralization as a Defense Barak demonstrated that decentralized blockchain systems, such as those utilizing zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), provide a less appealing target in that the hackers would need to break individual wallets rather than a central database. “If you can only access one account at a time, the payoff isn’t worth the risk,” Barak said.",btcpulse,https://btc-pulse.com/brazils-central-bank-service-provider-hacked-140m/,"FIAT|BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY|BTC|ETH","Blockchain|Sticky|Web3",cryptocompare

A jury in California has found the tech giant must pay damages for transferring data from idle Android smartphones without authorization, reports Reuters. Google says it will appeal the decision, which the lawsuit claims triggered “mandatory and unavoidable burdens shouldered by Android device users for Google’s benefit.” The jury found the data transfers violated California’s privacy laws, and the money will be handed exclusively to users in the state. According to the lawsuit, which was initiated in 2019, the company used customers’ cellular data to transfer information that was used for things like targeted advertising. In court, Google argued that the transfers were fully legal and covered by the company’s privacy policies and terms of service, and no users were harmed in any way. After the verdict was announced, Google spokesperson Jose Castaneda said the jury’s decision “misunderstands services that are critical to the security, performance, and reliability of Android devices.” Google is also facing a lawsuit on the transfers that represent customers in the rest of the country, which is set to start in the first half of next year.

2025-07-05T13:15:55,"Analyst to XRP Holders: XRP Mega Breakout Incoming","In a recent post that has stirred excitement across the crypto community, STEPH IS CRYPTO, a prominent analyst on X, issued a bold proclamation: a “mega breakout” is incoming for XRP. With XRP trading just above $2.20, mounting technical signals and broader market dynamics are aligning to suggest a major move could be imminent. Technical Compression Suggests Imminent Explosion Steph’s analysis centers around a well-defined descending triangle pattern on XRP’s 3-day chart, stretching back to January 2025. This formation, known for forecasting volatile breakouts once price compresses into a tight range, has seen XRP repeatedly test support above $2.00 while facing resistance around $2.33. According to Steph, the key signal to watch is a daily close above $2.33. If confirmed, it could trigger a sustained rally that breaks the current consolidation. Volume indicators support this view. Declining volume within the triangle suggests market indecision, but historically, this leads to explosive price action once momentum returns. #XRP MEGA breakout incoming! pic.twitter.com/ZTHaEXGgd4 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) July 5, 2025 Projected Price Targets: From $5 to Over $30 Using Fibonacci extensions drawn from XRP’s 2024 low to its January 2025 high, Steph outlined a series of ambitious but technically grounded price targets. The first leg, projected at $5.38, represents the 0.618 Fibonacci extension, a common target in early bullish waves. If momentum accelerates, further price levels at $11.31, $23.78, and even $37.63 come into view. Steph has consistently maintained that these projections are not short-term predictions, but part of a broader multi-leg breakout that could unfold over weeks or months. Patience, he notes, is essential. Monthly Chart Breakout on the Horizon The long-term setup also strengthens the bullish narrative. On the monthly chart, XRP appears to be forming a symmetrical triangle , with an apex estimated between early July and mid-September. This coincides with the timing window Steph referenced in previous updates. The importance of this setup cannot be overstated, historically, symmetrical triangles on higher time frames tend to precede prolonged directional moves. Key resistance zones sit between $2.40 and $2.69, which coincide with the 100-day and 200-day simple moving averages. A clean breakout above this region could see XRP reclaim $3.00 quickly, setting the stage for a move toward its all-time high of $3.40. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Broader Market and Regulatory Tailwinds Outside of technicals, broader market dynamics may serve as catalysts. Regulatory clarity is improving, especially following Ripple’s legal progress in its battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Combined with the increasing adoption of RLUSD and Ripple’s U.S. bank charter application, institutional sentiment around XRP appears to be turning positive. Steph and other analysts also point to the current macro cycle in crypto. With Bitcoin recently breaking new highs and altcoins starting to rotate into the spotlight, XRP’s timing for a breakout could hardly be better. Caution Still Warranted Despite the optimistic outlook, risks remain. There is a notable liquidity block around $2.00, representing a large sell wall. If price rejects from resistance and breaks below support zones like $2.06 or $1.95, the bullish setup could be invalidated or delayed. Traders and investors should watch these levels closely. A Moment of Truth for XRP With converging technical signals, supportive market sentiment, and macro tailwinds, XRP appears primed for what STEPH IS CRYPTO calls a “mega breakout.” The $2.33 level is the line in the sand, clear it, and XRP could be on a fast track to its most significant rally since 2017. For holders, the next few weeks may prove pivotal. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

2025-07-05T13:07:00,"Glassnode’s James Check Warns Bitcoin Treasury Boom Could Be Short-Lived","Glassnode lead analyst James Check has raised concerns over the longevity of the corporate Bitcoin treasury strategy, arguing the easy gains might already be gone for new entrants as the market matures. Key Takeaways: Glassnode’s James Check warns the Bitcoin treasury strategy may have limited upside left. Early movers like Michael Saylor’s Strategy are well-positioned. However, new treasury firms could struggle to differentiate and sustain premiums. “My instinct is the Bitcoin treasury strategy has a far shorter lifespan than most expect,” Check said in an X post on Friday , cautioning that many recent firms jumping into Bitcoin reserves could struggle to sustain interest or justify premiums. “For many new entrants, it could already be over,” he added. Early Bitcoin Treasuries Thrive as Newcomers Face Uphill Battle Check argued that while early adopters like Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which holds nearly 600,000 BTC, have cemented their lead, new treasury firms face a steeper climb. “Nobody wants the 50th Treasury company,” he noted, warning that investors increasingly expect clear differentiation rather than another firm adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet. “I think we’re already close to the ‘show me’ phase, where it will be increasingly difficult for random company X to sustain a premium and get off the ground without a serious niche,” Check said. My instinct is the Bitcoin treasury strategy has a far shorter lifespan than most expect, and for many new entrants, it could already be over. It's not about a measuring contest. It's about how serious & sustainable your product & Strategy is to sustain the accumulation. — _Checkmate (@_Checkmatey_) July 4, 2025 Despite Bitcoin’s recent rally to within 4% of its all-time high, Check suggested the growing number of Bitcoin treasury firms risks saturating the market. Data from BitcoinTreasuries shows at least 21 new entities added BTC holdings in the past month alone. Check highlighted that speculative retail investors may flock to these newcomers, but stressed they don’t “have infinite money” to support dozens of copycats chasing the same strategy. He noted that larger, well-established firms like Strategy have more time to prove their thesis compared to latecomers. Echoing his concerns, Taproot Wizards co-founder Udi Wizardheimer said many startups entering the Bitcoin treasury space appear to be motivated by short-term profits rather than long-term conviction. “Many of the folks raising just see easy money and have no idea what they’re doing,” Wizardheimer argued. He added that weaker players may eventually be acquired at a discount by stronger firms, though he believes the trend could still see “a few more legs.” Nobody wants the 50th Treasury company. I think we're already close to the 'show me' phase, where it will be increasingly difficult for random company x to sustain a premium and get off the ground without a serious niche. Retail speculators buy startup TCos, and they don't have… — _Checkmate (@_Checkmatey_) July 4, 2025 Doubts Grow Over Long-Term Viability of Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Skepticism around the sustainability of the Bitcoin treasury trend is growing. Breed, a venture capital firm, warned in a June 29 report that only a few Bitcoin treasury companies are likely to survive long term without falling into a “death spiral” as their stock prices converge with the value of their BTC holdings. The warning echoes recent comments from Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, who has voiced concerns over the Bitcoin treasury strategies adopted by some publicly traded firms. Sigel singled out the use of at-the-market (ATM) share issuance programs, arguing that these can become dilutive if a company’s stock price nears its Bitcoin net asset value (NAV). Meanwhile, New York law firm Pomerantz LLP has filed a class action lawsuit against Michael Saylor’s Strategy, accusing the Bitcoin-focused firm of misleading investors about the profitability and risks of its crypto investment strategy.

2025-07-05T13:00:50,"Bitcoin Enters New Era: Derivatives Dominate As Futures Volume Hits $650 Trillion","Bitcoin has experienced a volatile week, consolidating just below its $112,000 all-time high while bears repeatedly fail to break the key $105,000 support level. This price resilience comes as major macroeconomic developments fuel optimism across global markets. The US Congress passed President Donald Trump’s highly anticipated “big, beautiful” bill ahead of the July 4 deadline, and stronger-than-expected job report data added to the bullish sentiment. These events have helped stabilize risk appetite, providing a favorable backdrop for Bitcoin’s next move. Meanwhile, the derivatives market continues to expand rapidly. According to new data from CryptoQuant, since the launch of Bitcoin futures on Binance in September 2019, the platform has recorded over $650 trillion in cumulative BTC futures volume. In contrast, spot volume during the same period reached only $168 trillion—highlighting the growing dominance of leveraged trading and short-term speculation in shaping price action. As Bitcoin consolidates in this critical range, the interplay between macroeconomic catalysts and futures market dynamics will likely determine whether the next leg is a breakout into price discovery or a deeper retracement. For now, Bitcoin remains on solid footing, and market participants are watching closely for confirmation of trend direction. Bitcoin Approaches Price Discovery As Futures Volume Surges Bitcoin is on the verge of entering price discovery as bulls maintain control above the key $107,000 support. After a volatile consolidation phase, the market is heating up again with macroeconomic uncertainty fading. Bitcoin has gained 47% since its April lows and now trades less than 2% below its all-time high of $112,000. The coming days are expected to be decisive, as a confirmed breakout above this level would signal a fresh bullish expansion, while a drop below key support could trigger short-term downside. Top analyst Darkfost shared striking data revealing how the structure of the Bitcoin market has evolved. Since the launch of BTC futures on Binance in September 2019, the platform has accumulated more than $650 trillion in cumulative futures volume for Bitcoin alone. In comparison, spot volume during the same period reached $168 trillion, four times lower. This disparity marks a paradigm shift in market behavior. While spot volumes typically reflect long-term investor conviction, the rising dominance of futures trading illustrates the growing influence of speculative and leveraged activity in shaping price action. During this cycle, daily BTC futures volume on Binance has exceeded $75 billion on multiple occasions—an unprecedented threshold since the exchange first introduced BTC futures. As Bitcoin approaches a new potential high, the interaction between futures-driven momentum and broader market sentiment will play a pivotal role in determining the sustainability of the next move. Whether it’s a push into uncharted territory or another round of consolidation, the structure of today’s market makes clear that derivatives are now leading the charge. BTC Price Analysis: $109K Resistance Remains The Key Hurdle Bitcoin (BTC) continues to consolidate just below its all-time high, with the 12-hour chart showing a clear rejection from the $109,300 resistance zone. Price action remains compressed between $109K and the $106,000–$106,300 support cluster, which aligns with the 50 and 100 simple moving averages (SMAs). This structure suggests the market is in a state of preparation for a larger move. Volume has decreased slightly, reflecting market indecision, while price remains above the 200 SMA—a bullish sign for the medium-term trend. Bitcoin’s higher low structure since mid-June remains intact, supporting a bullish bias as long as the $106K area holds. A decisive breakout above $109,300 could trigger a rally toward price discovery above the $112K all-time high, but until then, the sideways movement signals caution. A breakdown below the $106K support could open the path to retesting $103,600, the last major demand zone. However, bulls continue to defend key moving averages, reinforcing current momentum. As the market awaits confirmation, traders are watching volume spikes and structural breaks for the next leg. With macro conditions improving and sentiment leaning bullish, Bitcoin’s next move could define July’s trend.

Long-Term Outlook Buoyed by Liquidity Forecasts While short-term sentiment faltered, longer-term bulls found encouragement in macro commentary from Sui Group Chief Economist Hong Hao. Speaking to Phoenix Finance, Hong projected that Bitcoin could hit fresh all-time highs by late 2025, driven by strong global liquidity and dovish monetary policies. Hong emphasised that Bitcoin remains highly responsive to changes in liquidity, and with central banks likely to loosen financial conditions into 2025, risk assets like BTC stand to benefit. He also pointed to improving sentiment in U.S. equities, suggesting broader risk-on appetite could return. For now, analysts say this dual narrative—short-term caution vs. long-term optimism—will likely keep BTC consolidating as markets digest the implications of dormant coin activity. #Bitcoin $BTC is consolidating near $108K after rejecting $110,400 resistance.

Trade Setup : Entry Zone: $107,800–$108,100 (watch for bullish engulfing) Upside Targets: $109,307 and $110,413 Stop-Loss: Below $107,200 to reduce risk MACD Signal: Bearish crossover; wait for confirmation For a Bitcoin price prediction , the next 48 hours will be crucial, as a break below the trendline support would invalidate the uptrend. However, if the $108K level holds, this remains a classic “buy-the-dip” scenario in a structurally bullish setup.

2025-07-05T13:00:19,"Bitcoin ‘Very, Very Likely’ To Hit $250,000 or Higher, Says Crypto Trader Michaël van de Poppe – Here’s His Timeline","A widely followed crypto analyst says that Bitcoin ( BTC ) is extremely likely to hit $250,000 or possibly even higher. In a new video update, crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 170,000 YouTube subscribers that based on historical precedent, the top crypto asset by market cap appears ready to skyrocket. According to Van de Poppe, BTC is flashing signs of an upcoming rally fueled by exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows. “We are currently consolidating around $100,000 only because we have a new group of participants being into the space due to the ETFs, which if that amount of money is pushing Bitcoin to $100,000, then we are I think underestimating the impact of the actual bull run to be happening and how high Bitcoin can go.” The trader goes on to say that BTC is essentially repeating the same pattern it did during its last few cycles, which this time around would see it rally to a price tag of $250,000, noting that he believes the crypto king would be $50,000 currently if it weren’t for the ETFs. “It’s remarkable and it’s comparable with the previous cycles but just at a different stage and we just need to move upwards with our expectations given that the ETF has been bringing Bitcoin towards higher valuations and I think if we didn’t have the ETF we would have been swimming around $50,000 and then it follows us with the M2 supply chart… which basically tells us that Bitcoin is going to follow that. And if Bitcoin is going to follow through with that, we are about to see Bitcoin move to $160,000- $180,000 in the next three months. And what we also know is that the second half of the year is usually the best period for crypto, if the next quarter after that is going to take place as well, it is very, very likely that Bitcoin is going to reach a number of $250,000 or potentially even higher.” BTC ETFs launched in January 2024 and have a total combined market cap of $138.5 billion at time of writing, according to data from Coinglass. BTC is trading for $107,627 at time of writing, a 1.9% decrease during the last 24 hours.

2025-07-05T12:56:55,"Senator Lummis Introduces New Crypto Tax Bill With a $300 Tax-Free Threshold","Senator Cynthia Lummis has introduced a crypto tax bill that exempts capital gains of $300 or less and has a $5,000 annual exemption cap. The US Senator has introduced the bill to address what she believes is the unfair treatment of crypto traders. Lummis said that her tax bill will allow US citizens to engage with the crypto economy without inadvertently accruing a tax bill. Lummis justifies the viability of her bill by stating that the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimates it will generate $600 million by 2035. This is a significant step for the crypto community, which has faced uncertainty and regulatory hurdles for quite some time now, and would like to embrace financial innovations without having to deal with draconian tax requirements. “This groundbreaking legislation”, said Senator Lummis, “is fully paid-for, cuts through the bureaucratic red tape, and establishes common-sense rules that reflect how digital technologies function in the real world. We cannot allow our archaic tax policies to stifle American innovation, and my legislation ensures Americans can participate in the digital economy without inadvertent tax violations”. The Lummis Crypto Tax Bill would adhere to the current agenda made popular under President Trump, introducing commonsense tax legislation that allows American businesses to thrive in a competitive global market. Lummis has introduced a practical tax-free threshold for digital asset transactions that fall below $300, with an annual limit of $5,000 in transactions. In many countries, cryptocurrencies are not considered currencies, despite clear indications, including their name, as to the true intention of their creator. There remains considerable uncertainty regarding crypto regulation, particularly with respect to tax requirements. Senator Lummis’s bill, therefore, could be a very big breakthrough for crypto traders across the globe. With Lummis’ crypto tax, a person could buy a coffee without having to pay capital gains. It should be a matter of common sense that a person using cryptocurrencies to buy a coffee is not engaging in a serious investment, but is instead treating their cryptocurrency as a currency. The Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that Lummis’s bill would generate $600 million through 2034, a figure that Senator Lummis likes to remind people about. Lummis stresses that the bill reflects how cryptocurrencies are used in the real world. She has described her bill as a commonsense approach. The current government in the US has been focused on cutting red tape and creating regulation that seeks to deregulate the market. Lummis, therefore, is creating timely legislation that may have a good chance of succeeding. The implications for American crypto traders would be immense and would certainly lift a weight of uncertainty from their shoulders. Lummis is concerned that inadvertent tax penalties would discourage Americans from embracing technological innovation. Senator Lummis is a Republican politician from Wyoming. She could very well succeed in passing the bill due to the substantial magnitude of the tax exemption. America could very well become a crypto superpower if the industry is given appropriate tax incentives. Senator Lummis believes this is the case and stresses the need to provide Americans with commonsense tax requirements. Lummis has frequently been an outspoken advocate for Bitcoin and other digital assets. She believes that draconian tax requirements are preventing people from experimenting with cryptocurrencies. Lummis aims to create laws that encourage people to use cryptocurrencies without incurring large tax bills. The tax department should use incentives rather than punishments to support the tech sector. After all, punishments are less effective than incentives.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/senator-lummis-introduces-new-crypto-tax-bill-with-a-300-tax-free-threshold/,"REGULATION|MARKET|BTC","Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Cryptocurrency News",cryptocompare
2025-07-05T12:30:42,"Bitcoin Investor Sentiment Back To ‘Very Bullish’ — What This Means","The Bitcoin price action was largely sideways rather than strongly bullish for most of June. As of early July, the flagship cryptocurrency has maintained its movements around $108,000 – $110,000 region. While Bitcoin still retains its bullish market structure, recent on-chain data calls for a level of caution when investors are looking for opportunities in the market. Bitcoin Sentiment Recovers From Bearish In a July 4 post on the social media platform X, crypto analytics firm Alphractal revealed that the Bitcoin investor sentiment is “very bullish.” This on-chain observation is based on the Alpha Crypto Sentiment Gauge metric. Related Reading: XRP’s 30% Jump To $2.8: Analyst Says This ‘Classic Confirmation’ Must Happen First As its name suggests, the indicator evaluates the emotions of investors in the market, ranging from extreme fear to euphoria. These emotions are represented as color-coded interpretations, usually in red, yellow, light green, and dark green, and these further represent investor sentiment ranging from bearish to very bullish. In the chart shared by Alphractal above, the appearance of a dark green colour signals that the market sentiment is “very bullish” at the moment. Prior to their July 4 post, Alphractal reported in a June 23 post that the market sentiment was flashing bearish signals. In the post on X, the analytics firm warned that the bears could be in trouble. Interestingly, the bears were indeed in trouble, as Bitcoin picked up more buying momentum, consequently liquidating several bearish positions. However, Alphractal explained that sighting green does not necessarily mean the market may be at a top. Instead, it signals that euphoria is taking over the market, which, according to the analytics firm, unlocks a wave of opportunities for Bitcoin buyers. Alphractal said: On the other hand, red zones are usually short-lived, but offer exceptional buy opportunities — like no other indicator can. As the market displayed, the bearish signal interpreted from the Sentiment Gauge eventually provided more buying opportunities. Growing market euphoria is not the only meaning that can be derived from a green signal in the market. It could also serve as a warning for potential overconfidence in the market as Bitcoin continues to gain value. If history is anything to go by, the market could experience rapid price expansions and an increase in investor risk-on approach. On the other hand, the “very bullish” sentiment could also precede sharp corrections, especially if fueled by crowd emotion, rather than market fundamentals. Whether this green sentiment signals the next price leg up, or the establishment of a market top is yet to be known — as a result, traders are advised to remain alert. Bitcoin Price At A Glance After its early show of strength on Thursday, Bitcoin has lost nearly 2% of its value in the past 24 hours. As of this writing, the premier cryptocurrency is valued at about $107,754.

2025-07-05T12:30:29,"Russia goes after illegal miners with new registry for crypto mining rigs","Government departments in Russia have created a special register for coin mining equipment to help local authorities in their efforts to curb illegal mining activities. The initiative of the executive power in Moscow comes amid an ongoing crackdown on miners working outside the law in Russian regions, often powering their crypto farms with stolen electricity. Russia registers mining hardware to track down rogue miners Russia’s Ministry of Energy, the Federal Tax Service (FNS) and the Ministry of Digital Development have compiled a register of devices used for cryptocurrency mining, RIA Novosti reported , quoting Deputy Energy Minister Petr Konyushenko. The gathered information has already been shared with authorities in the Russian regions witnessing increased miner activity, the government official revealed in an interview with the leading news agency, elaborating: “The creation of such a register will allow us to accurately identify consumers using electricity for mining needs. This is necessary in order to apply special regulation and taxation to those.” Konyushenko described the move as a step towards legalizing the whole industry while reducing the illegal consumption of electricity, which has been blamed for losses for the power distribution companies and the state as well as energy deficits in parts of the country. The energy ministry pitched the idea to establish a unified register of mining equipment during a working meeting on the regulation of digital currency extraction in February. The proposal was also backed by the Russian Ministry of Industry in May. Russia legalized cryptocurrency mining with a law adopted in the summer of 2024. It allows both companies and individual entrepreneurs to legally mint digital coins in the Russian Federation, provided they register with the tax authority and pay due taxes. Private citizens are allowed to mine without registration as long as their electricity consumption does not exceed a limit set by the government, which is currently 6,000 kWh a month. However, all miners, including the latter, are obliged to inform the FNS about the amount and the value of the mined cryptocurrency. Moscow cracks down on illegal crypto farms amid mining ban Russia, which has established itself as a major player in the global Bitcoin mining market over the past few years, has been struggling to bring its miners out of the shadows ever since it legalized the industry last year. Less than a third of all Russian mining enterprises have so far registered with the FNS and the new register of mining machines aims to increase the share of legal mining businesses. Other Russian authorities have also joined the hunt for underground miners. In June, the national grid operator Rosseti announced it’s developing a mechanism to pinpoint illegal mining facilities by tracking internet traffic with the help of telecom companies and mobile operators. To limit the negative consequences of the mining boom, which has caused electricity shortages, the Russian government has also imposed seasonal and permanent restrictions on the activity in parts of the vast country. Mining has been completely banned for six years in a dozen regions. This week, President Vladimir Putin justified the measures with the need to balance the exploitation of Russia’s natural resources. At a forum devoted to discussing development initiatives, Putin said that governors have been complaining about growing energy deficits and admitted: “We were forced to make certain decisions in the mining sphere.” Meanwhile, Russian law enforcement and other officials have been cracking down on mining facilities illegally tapped into electricity networks in energy-deficient regions. Last month, the authorities in Krasnoyarsk Krai, a major mining hotspot in Siberia, busted a massive crypto farm occupying almost 30,000 square meters of land, officially registered as a non-residential building on an industrial plot.

2025-07-05T12:30:00,"MUTM keeps climbing as XRP fails: is this the top crypto of July 2025?","Ripple’s XRP had a turbulent run in June, which saw the coin lose momentum. The price hovered around $2 even amid an ambitious announcement by Ripple Labs’ CEO. However, July could be different for the crypto market, and investors are paying attention. The fundamentals in the crypto sector look strong, which could signal that a massive run is in the works. To capitalize on this run, XRP whales are looking for small, promising projects that signal a massive upside. So far, one of the best projects that analysts have identified is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . All signs point to the MUTM token outperforming XPR in the upcoming rally, and investors are capitalizing on this positive forecast. July 2025 has seen a massive rush into the Mutuum Finance presale, and we will dive deep into this trend to help you understand what is going on. The protocol design Mutuum Finance is a DeFi lending protocol that lets users participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. As lenders, they deposit their assets into the pools for the chance to earn interest. Meanwhile, borrowers can deposit their collateral into the pools to access the liquidity in the pools. The stability of the entire ecosystem is protected via over-collateralization. This process ensures that the value of collateral is always higher than the value of borrowed assets. To achieve capital efficiency, interest rates in the pools are based on the pool utilization rate. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale breaks records The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is currently in phase 5, where tokens are going for $0.03. So far, the presale has raised over $11.7 million from around 12,700 unique buyers. At the rate at which tokens in phase 5 are selling out, there may not be any left for you. So far, over half of the tokens set aside for the phase have been sold, barely a month after they went on sale. One of the main drivers of the current phase of the presale is that the price is a 50% discount on the final launch price of $0.06. Most observers of the presale expect the tokens in phase 5 to sell out by the end of July. With 60% of the tokens already sold, this could be a reality soon. As such, now is the time to get your tokens while the massive discount is still available. In the upcoming phase 6, the token price will go up by 16.67%, wiping out this discount. How high could MUTM tokens rise? According to the latest analysts’ projections, the price of MUTM tokens could go up by 4400% when they launch. That means a $1600 investment in the presale today could grow to over $70,000. That is a massive return that no one should miss out on. Best of all, the presale has no upper caps on how much you can invest. Consequently, your return could easily be double or triple the $70k, depending on how much you decide to invest. One of the reasons why analysts are so confident about the future of MUTM tokens is due to the current market conditions. For instance, it is worth noting that while crypto prices are in a consolidation phase, there have not been massive outflows of capital. The price of BTC remains at around $105,000, which is a huge change from past performance. In the past, after a huge rally, like the one in May 2025, the price of BTC would sometimes fall by double digits. However, this time, the price of BTC has basically stagnated. That means there have not been major outflows, thanks in part to the entry of institutional investors in the sector. The current conditions mean that the next rally will be bigger than anything experienced before in the crypto market. It could be the final rally before the crypto market finally stabilizes and matures. As such, this MUTM token presale represents the last opportunity to make truly massive returns in the crypto sector. Mutuum Finance partners with CertiK To ensure the long-term protection of its users, Mutuum Finance recently announced a partnership with CertiK. The two will partner on a $50,000 USDT bug bounty program. The program will be split into four tiers, which are critical, major, minor, and low. This will ensure that those security experts who identify the biggest issues will receive the biggest rewards. MUTM is the crypto to watch in July 2025 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents an exciting opportunity for massive gains. So far, 60% of the tokens set aside for phase 5 have been sold, less than a month after they launched. With a 50% discount available to phase 5 buyers, this is the time to act. In the next phase, the token price will go up by double digits, greatly diminishing the discount you will get.

While most retail investors remain cautious as the bitcoin price continues to consolidate around $108k. In the meantime, Bitcoin’s “mega whales” are quietly adding to their stacks. This quiet accumulation might be a strong signal of what’s coming next for Bitcoin’s price. Mega Whales Keep Accumulating Recent data shows more Bitcoin wallets now hold over $10 million worth of Bitcoin. This number has grown by 4.23%, which means big investors and rich companies still trust Bitcoin. These big players are not buying because of hype, they are buying quietly now, hoping for a bigger price jump later. Smaller wallets are doing the same. Wallets with $100,000 to $1 million in Bitcoin have gone up by 2.71%, and wallets with $1 million to $10 million have increased by 2.34%. This steady buying shows that many people still believe Bitcoin will grow more in the future, especially if new ETFs bring in more money and governments stay supportive. Price Still Range-Bound, But Whales Stay Calm Right now, Bitcoin has been stuck trying to break above the key resistance between $107,000 and $110,000 . So far, it’s mostly been bouncing around this area without a strong breakout. Even though excitement among smaller traders hasn’t fully returned, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at a healthy 55, showing there’s still room for upward momentum without the market being overbought. What’s different this time is the patience. These big players aren’t chasing short-term gains. Their buying looks slow and deliberate, suggesting they expect something bigger in the long run. Bitcoin Eyeing New ATH: $120k History shows that whale accumulation often happens before major rallies. If Bitcoin can break above the $110,000 resistance with strong volume and hold its ground, the next target could be the psychological $120,000 mark.

BlackRock’s substantial and continuous accumulation of Ethereum, following their success with Bitcoin ETFs, is widely seen as a definitive sign of increasing institutional adoption.
