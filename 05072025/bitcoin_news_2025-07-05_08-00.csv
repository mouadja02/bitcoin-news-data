2025-07-05T05:52:16,"Billionaire Bitcoin Whales Waking Up; More Than 80,000 BTC Moved—Should You be Worried?","The post Billionaire Bitcoin Whales Waking Up; More Than 80,000 BTC Moved—Should You be Worried? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As the Bitcoin price is heading close to the ATH, interesting events unfold within the crypto markets. Not long after, a whale that had remained dormant for over 14 years woke up, transferred 10,000 BTC, and reportedly sold. Many more ‘Billionaire’ whales have also emerged. Despite this, the BTC price continues to remain calm with fewer signs of a massive pullback. This raises concerns over the upcoming rally as the price remains unaffected by the whale movements. 80,000 BTC Moved—Will They Be SOLD? During the earlier days of BTC, addresses held more than 10,000 BTC. There are 20 such dormant addresses, which collectively hold 1% of all BTC mined in 2010-2011. Interestingly, 8 out of 20 addresses have just woken up and have transferred more than 80,000 BTC collectively. Source: X The question is not whether the whales are preparing for a sell-off, but why they have moved now. Previously, when Bitcoin surged above the $100K milestone and went on to mark a new ATH above $111K, these whales remained passive. Now that the price has hit $110K yet again, these whales have become active. This suggests either the whales may not be confident of the upcoming price action, or they may be feeling that the markets may face a liquidity crunch as BTC marks a new ATH. Hence, they may be preparing to accumulate as much liquidity as they can. However, many believe this whale is an old miner from 2011, having originally controlled around 200,000 BTC. Meanwhile, the rumors are also that these are Satoshi-linked funds, but there is no evidence to support this. Historically, Q1 2025 has seen more BTC token transfers than Q1 2024, marking a 121% year-on-year increase, which signals a broader trend of awakening old coins. What Does it Mean Going Forward? The Bitcoin price may face high short-term volatility, such as large transactions that usually spook the markets. In this case, there is no clear sell-off potential, as no immediate sign of deposits to exchanges was seen. However, the market participants need to closely monitor the price actions and a few watchpoints, like, Further movement from the remaining 4 dormant wallets Any BTC transferred to exchange addresses or OTC desks Bitcoin (BTC) price action around the key levels—$110,000 resistance to $108,000 support.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/billionaire-bitcoin-whales-waking-up-more-than-80000-btc-moved-should-you-be-worried/,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|EXCHANGE","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

Still, he predicts BTC will resume its climb. He also noted rising government interest in stablecoins not for payments, but to help reduce U.S. debt through Treasury bill purchases.

A BCH test transaction was spotted from one of the whale wallets just an hour before the BTC began moving, suggesting the private key may have been tested discreetly.

2025-07-05T05:12:31,"Eight Bitcoin Wallets Move 80,000 BTC in Largest Ever ‘Satoshi Era’ Transfers","More than $8 billion worth of bitcoin mined during the network’s earliest days — colloquially known as the “Satoshi era” — were moved Friday in the largest such transfer on record. Two wallets that had remained dormant for over 14 years each transferred 10,000 BTC to new addresses around early Friday, blockchain data shows. The two addresses had initially received their coins on April 3, 2011, when bitcoin traded at just 78 cents. That BTC is now worth over $1.1 billion per wallet at current prices, marking an appreciation of more than 13.9 million percent. The original source of the coins was wallet “1HqXB…gDwcK,” which sent 23,377.83 BTC to three separate wallets in 2011. Two of those — “12tLs…xj2me” and “1KbrS…AWJYm” — held the bulk until this week. The third wallet, which received 3,377 BTC, had already spent its funds in 2011. Late Friday, on-chain analysis firm Arkham flagged that six other wallets moved over 10,000 bitcoin (BTC) in quick succession, worth over $8.6 billion at current prices. The same entity apparently owns all of these wallets, Akrham said. However, no individual or company has publicly claimed ownership of these wallets as of Asian morning hours on Saturday. The transferred BTC was sent to fresh wallets using a modern, lower-fee address format. Neither of the new wallets has since moved the funds further, and the identity of the wallet owner remains unknown. All of these moved coins are among the rarest class of BTC: mined or transacted during the “Satoshi era,” a loosely defined period from bitcoin’s launch in 2009 through 2011, when its pseudonymous creator was still active online. Wallets from this time are considered part of crypto’s holy grail — rarely moved and often watched closely by traders for market signals, as any large sales could be perceived as an early believer or miner changing their stance on the market.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/05/eight-bitcoin-wallets-move-80000-btc-in-largest-ever-satoshi-era-transfers,"BTC|MARKET|ARKM|BLOCKCHAIN","Markets|Bitcoin|News",cryptocompare

2025-07-05T05:00:21,"Bitcoin Near Historic Weekly Close Despite Drop – Analyst Warns Of Volatile Weekend","As the market sees a Friday retrace, Bitcoin (BTC) is attempting to reclaim a crucial area as support. An analyst suggests that the flagship crypto’s daily close could set the stage for a bullish end of the week despite potential volatility. Related Reading: SUI Prepares For Bullish Flag Breakout Amid $3 Reclaim – Analyst Doubles The Target Bitcoin Breakout To Come ‘Sooner Or Later’ At the start of the new quarter, Bitcoin has retested crucial levels, touching the $105,000 support and $110,000 resistance over the past four days. Amid its Tuesday pullback, the flagship crypto fell to a two-week low but managed to bounce from a crucial range. Analyst Sjuul from AltCryptoGems previously noted that BTC needed a strong rebound from the “most important” support and resistance area, between the $104,000 and $106,000 price levels, explaining that failing to hold this range would open the door for a drop to the range lows around $101,000. On Friday, the analyst highlighted Bitcoin’s price action after holding the key levels, which “provided the perfect entry for a bounce, just as expected.” Following this performance, he asserted that Bitcoin is expanding on its two-month Power of Three (Po3) setup, signaling that potential further expansion is ahead. Nonetheless, he pointed out that the flagship crypto is still trading in a two-month range, suggesting a volatile price action until the price successfully breaks out, which it has attempted to do earlier this week. “Since we are in a range, we are forced to respect the key levels of the range: high, mid, and low,” Sjuul detailed, adding that all eyes are currently on the mid-range, where bulls must step in to confirm the bullish move to the range high. Based on this, the analyst forecasted another move above the $110,00 mark, where “we have left a lot of unfinished business” and “plenty of liquidity lies.” He pointed to a huge cluster near the $111,000 area in BTC’s Liquidity Heatmap, affirming that “price is attracted by liquidity, so I am expecting that level to be visited sooner or later.” BTC Eyes Pivotal Closes After being rejected from the $108,000 at the start of the week, analyst Rekt Capital noted that Bitcoin broke out of two 2-week downtrends in the past 40 days but was rejected from the crucial 6-week diagonal downtrend, around the $108,000 mark, during the same timeframe. This week, BTC closed above this resistance twice, and daily closed above the $109,000 mark on Thursday. However, Friday’s pullback saw Bitcoin drop below the crucial level, falling to the $107,245 area. The analyst considers that a key retest of the pattern is in progress. He previously explained that any dipping into the top of Bitcoin’s pattern could “technically be considered additional retesting to further solidify the recently broken black diagonal resistance into new support.” Nonetheless, BTC must close today above the diagonal resistance for a successful retest. “Bitcoin is losing the diagonal for the moment. But if price Daily Closes above the diagonal, then this will have ended as a downside wick as part of a volatile retest. Upcoming Daily Close will be pivotal,” he stated. Related Reading: Ethereum Eyes Key Resistance As Price Reclaims $2,550 – Here Are The Levels To Watch Meanwhile, Bitcoin is also on the cusp of making history as its price nears the “final major Weekly resistance” around the $109,000. Rekt Capital detailed that if BTC closes above this level, it would confirm a break from this major resistance, which would likely unlock a new all-time high (ATH). He concluded that, with the recent weekend volatility, “we won’t know until the very last moment heading into the new Weekly Close whether this level has been flipped into support or not.” Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",newsbtc,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-near-historic-weekly-close-despite-drop-analyst-warns-of-volatile-weekend/,"BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET","Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin price|btc|BTC ATH|BTC breakout|BTCUSDT|crypto analyst|Crypto Bull Run 2025|Crypto Market Recovery|crypto market retrace|Crypto trader",cryptocompare
2025-07-05T05:00:16,"Gunnar Strömmer calls law enforcement to increase cryptocurrency seizure","Strömmer has encouraged the authorities to utilize more forfeiture laws that were put in place last November. These laws allow enforcement agencies to confiscate assets even if it cannot be proved that someone has broken the law. This means if officials believe that anyone has earned cryptocurrency illegally or that person cannot explain where the money came from, the police and other arms of the government will be able to acquire it by law. Swedish lawmakers advocate for a national Bitcoin reserve The new laws are one of the strictest in Europe, Strömmer noted. Following reliable sources, the rule prompted the seizure of 80 million Swedish kronor, equivalent to $8.4 million in assets. According to the website of the Swedish parliament, this law also applies to children and young people, as well as those who suffered from a severe mental disorder at the time of the crime. Based on the Minister of Justice they aim to ensure that the authorities work together more closely and pay special attention to assets that bring big profits. “Now it’s a matter of turning up the pressure further,” Strömmer said. Strömmer’s requests for more active seizures come as some Riksdag lawmakers advocate creating a national Bitcoin reserve . This approach resembles the trend in the US, Czechia, and Italy. In the meantime, a leading advocate of a Bitcoin reserve, Dennis Dioukarev, a Member of the Riksdag, commented on the topic of discussion. Dioukarev told reporters he agrees with Strömmer’s calls to increase seizure enforcement. He welcomed every effort to seize illegally obtained assets. Dioukarev argued that this would help to fight crime and make life hard for criminals. As for what will or should be done with seized crypto, Dioukarev reiterates his calls for the accumulation of a strategic reserve. Based on his explanation, cryptocurrencies in general and Bitcoin in particular that are confiscated should be transferred to Sweden’s central bank, the Riksbank, to build a strategic Bitcoin reserve. The Swedish authorities reveal increasing cryptocurrency adoption among criminals When reporters last asked Minister Strömmer’s press office about the fate of seized cryptocurrencies, one of his press officers responded that they could not answer those questions then. This inability to comment also extended to questions about what steps Strömmer and the Swedish government intend to take to enhance crypto-related asset seizures. In 2024, 62,000 individuals were part of or linked to criminal networks in Sweden, according to the Bloomsbury Intelligence & Security Institute. Drug dealers and money launderers were among those using cryptocurrency a lot, though it is hard to measure exactly how much. Additionally, in September, the Police Authority and the Financial Intelligence Unit in Sweden reported that some cryptocurrency exchanges were skilled money launderers. The report recommended that law enforcement gradually increase its monitoring and infiltration of crypto exchange platforms to help detect and disrupt illegal operations.

Here’s how much profit was involved in the transaction. A Significant Amount Of Ancient Bitcoin Has Just Been Transferred As explained by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in a new post on X, there have been a couple of unprecedented transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. The transfers in question involved the movement of 20,000 BTC in two batches (that is, 10,000 tokens in each move) sitting dormant since 14.3 years ago. “This is never before witnessed in Bitcoin’s entire history,” notes Maartunn. When the tokens involved in these moves were last transacted in April 2011, they were worth a total of $15,586. Today, they are worth upwards of $2.1 billion. This naturally suggests that with the move, the owner of the tokens has harvested an extraordinary amount of profit. More specifically, the move has realized a gain of almost 13.8 million percent. An indicator that has registered a notable spike because of the dormancy-breaking transactions is the Bitcoin Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) . A ‘coin day’ is a quantity that one token of the asset accumulates after being still on the blockchain for one day. When a coin that has been dormant for some number of days is moved, its coin days counter resets back to zero and the coin days that it had been carrying are said to be ‘destroyed.’ The CDD measures the total number of coin days being reset in this manner across the network. Naturally, the CDD is particularly sensitive to moves from the diamond hands of the Bitcoin market, as their tokens tend to carry a large number of coin days. The 20,000 BTC transactions from today are quite ancient, so it’s to be expected that they would register on the indicator. And indeed, as the chart for the metric displays, each of the two 10,000 BTC transfers involved the destruction of more than 52 million coin days. Thus, collectively, the moves have caused the CDD to reach over 104 million coin days. Now, what could these moves mean for the Bitcoin market? Generally, when such ancient coins move, the motive is likely to be selling. In this particular case, however, the investor involved may not be a high-conviction holder. This is because coins that reach such an old age usually get there by becoming lost, either due to their existence being forgotten or having their keys misplaced. As such, it’s probable that the tokens have only recently been rediscovered. Selling from holders carrying coins from a few years ago can be a sign of conviction breaking in the sector, but this particular move may not be it.

2025-07-05T03:45:50,"While Bitcoin Hovers Below $120K, MAGACOIN FINANCE Near $0.00010425 Gains Buyers As Optimism Weakens","While Bitcoin finishes June with a record monthly close, hovering just below $120,000, a different kind of asset is turning heads among crypto investors— MAGACOIN FINANCE . This decentralized political memecoin is gaining traction fast, leveraging cultural relevance and community-first principles to draw attention during a phase of Bitcoin consolidation. With BTC trading just under major resistance levels and short-term optimism showing signs of fatigue, traders are increasingly looking for early-stage altcoins that combine narrative strength with transparent tokenomics. MAGACOIN FINANCE is meeting that demand by offering not only meme-driven virality but also a strong ideological identity. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Grabbing Trader Interest Bitcoin remains the market anchor, but its current rangebound behavior—hovering between $106,500 and $109,000—has led many to look elsewhere for growth catalysts. As 97% of BTC supply sits in profit, profit-taking and increased volatility are likely. This has opened a window for tokens that aren’t dependent on macro catalysts. MAGACOIN FINANCE is thriving in that gap, driven by: A grassroots political theme that resonates with today’s crypto-savvy, ideologically driven investor A fixed supply and zero-tax structure that encourages clean trading and long-term holding Increasing market visibility via Telegram growth, Twitter engagement, and early analyst coverage A community-based roadmap that emphasizes decentralized control over VC-backed influence Rather than react to market cycles, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building a brand—one that blends humor, resistance, and decentralized ideals into one package. Not Just a Meme Coin—A Cultural Statement MAGACOIN FINANCE separates itself from other memecoins through purpose. It’s not just a token chasing virality—it’s a political and cultural statement against centralization and gatekeeping in both traditional finance and blockchain governance. That positioning places it alongside community-aligned projects like Cardano and Ethereum in philosophy, while operating in the meme-layer ecosystem popularized by Dogecoin and SHIBA INU. It bridges these two worlds: the entertainment value of memes and the conviction of decentralized movements. This hybrid identity is fueling a sense of belonging among holders who view crypto not just as a market—but as a movement. Why Market Analysts Are Watching Closely With Bitcoin dominance still high and many top altcoins consolidating, attention is turning to tokens that show organic growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE has already crossed key traction milestones, including: Over 20,000 active community members across platforms Inclusion in early “watchlist” articles by altcoin analysts Strong participation from politically engaged investor segments Rumors of exchange readiness and upcoming feature rollouts As Bitcoin prepares for potentially volatile July sessions and macro conditions fluctuate around U.S. Federal Reserve decisions, many believe the cultural layer of crypto could lead the next wave of rotation. MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioned as a leading candidate. The Bottom Line: MAGACOIN FINANCE Taps Into 2025’s Meme-Political Wave Bitcoin may be holding its ground just below a psychological milestone, but MAGACOIN FINANCE is moving differently. It’s not waiting for ETF headlines or macro decisions—it’s building a decentralized brand powered by meme culture and political relevance. For investors seeking the next wave of crypto identity projects—where culture, narrative, and ownership align—MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a frontrunner.

2025-07-05T02:00:47,"Dogecoin Social Surge: Rising Buzz And Network Use Spark New Interest","Dogecoin’s price action caught traders’ attention this week. After dipping toward the $0.13–$0.15 demand zone, the meme‑coin shot higher, and a surge in derivatives data suggests many expect more gains. Related Reading: Ethereum Network Awakens—Massive On-Chain Moves Signal What’s Coming Trader Interest Climbs Around $0.19 Resistance According to market data, Open Interest jumped by 16% to reach over $2 billion. Options volume exploded by 400%. That kind of rise often points to big bets on upward swings. Right now, many eyes are on the $0.20 resistance level. If DOGE can close a daily candle above that line, it may clear the way toward $0.27. Dogecoin’s technical setup is drawing fresh looks from chart watchers. The Stochastic RSI crossed above 80, which can mark an overbought zone. Yet coins have stayed above overbought readings before when buyers kept pushing. Traders will want to see real volume behind any move above that descending trendline near $0.19. Without it, the rally may stall or give back gains. Whales Return With Spot Inflows Based on reports, Dogecoin saw a net inflow of $8.20 million into spot wallets. That marks a big shift after weeks of outflows. Large holders have been moving coins onto exchanges in the past, but now they’re pulling more in. In other cycles, fresh whale buys have lined up with mid‑term rallies. On‑chain metrics add another layer. Dogecoin’s MVRV Z‑score climbed back to 0.355 after hitting near‑historical lows late in June. That figure measures how much profit holders stand to make on average. A rising score hints that fewer holders are underwater, and that might draw in new buyers. Still, MVRV is backward‑looking. It can’t predict if price will break through key resistance. Network Activity Shows Mixed Signals Network stats tell a mixed story. Daily active addresses slid to 34 K, and transaction counts dropped to 15K as of July 3. That’s a sharp fall from the more than 500K addresses and transactions seen in the last week of June. Lower usage could sap the rally’s legs if retail traders don’t reengage soon. Related Reading: The Silent Bitcoin Accumulation: Public Companies’ Surprising H1 2025 Lead Even with these mixed signals, the mood toward Dogecoin is brighter than it was a week ago. Traders piling into options and hikes in Open Interest show speculative appetite is up. Large spot inflows show that whales have stepped back in. But network usage is lagging. If daily addresses and transactions don’t bounce back, bulls may find it harder to sustain the push.

This shift opens up new opportunities for savvy investors. Discover which DeFi projects are poised for significant growth and could potentially offer impressive returns. Jupiter (JUP) Price Insights: Past Declines and Key Support Zones JUP behavior shows a one-month drop of 18.01% and a six-month decline of 53.73%. A one-week gain of 12.07% hints at short-term movement amid longer-term pressure. Price action over the recent month was marked by a steady descent, with the half-year view underlining a significant weakening in value. The past figures indicate that the coin experienced a brief rally before facing sustained losses, highlighting a period of volatility and bearish influence. Current price stands between $0.34 and $0.57, with the first resistance at $0.69 and a higher barrier at $0.92. Support emerges at $0.21, with a secondary level at $0.00. Technical readings, including an RSI near 50, reveal a market lacking a clear trend. Bears hold sway for now, as reflected in the negative summary and moving average recommendations. Traders might target support at $0.21 for a bounce before considering a push higher, while breaks above $0.69 could trigger bullish activity. A cautious approach is advised, monitoring these key levels for decisive movements. Chainlink Price Shifts: Recent Rally Amid Long-Term Bearish Trends Chainlink experienced a modest rebound last week with a 3.75% increase. However, the asset declined about 5% over the month and saw a significant drop of over 43% in the past six months. This recent activity points to short-term gains, contrasting sharply with long-term bearish trends as selling pressure has dominated for several months. Price movements remain volatile, with brief moments of buyer activity, yet the overall trend suggests a lack of sustained upward momentum. Chainlink is currently trading within a range of approximately $11 to $15.70. Key resistance is noted around $18.03, with initial support at $8.63. Additional resistance appears near $22.73, and a secondary support level is at $3.94. Technical indicators provide a mixed picture, indicating balance between buyers and sellers, with the Relative Strength Index near 50. Recent trading reflects a minor weekly gain, but ongoing monthly and six-month declines show persistent selling pressure. Bulls need to overcome the $18.03 barrier, while bears may push prices toward support. Traders should watch for movements around $8.63 or potential pullbacks. Caution is necessary due to the mixed market signals. Aave: Price Fluctuations Signal Cautious Optimism for Recovery Over the last month, Aave witnessed modest gains as its price increased by 1.68%, following a strong one-week surge of 8.27%. The coin experienced mixed performance with a striking six-month decline of 22.90%, reflecting investor hesitance after prior volatility. Price actions during this period showcased erratic behavior, with brief bullish bursts amid broader downward trends, highlighting the challenges of market recovery. Investors exhibited cautious optimism, balancing short-term rallies with long-term decline, resulting in market sentiment oscillating between hope and uncertainty. Current prices trade between $216 and $328.64, with bulls eyeing a primary resistance level at $382.89 and a secondary target at $494.61, while bears support a near-term floor of $159.44 and a deeper level at $47.72. Indicators including an Awesome Oscillator reading of 8.83 and a Momentum Indicator of 7.18 point to moderate upward pressure, with an RSI at 53.32 suggesting near-neutral conditions. The market lacks a definitive trend, requiring careful positioning within these key levels. Traders may consider short-term entries to profit from rebounds toward resistance while using stop-loss orders beneath support levels to limit risk. Uniswap Price Rebound: Short-Term Gains Amid Long-Term Struggles Recent UNI price action shows a gain of nearly 11% over the past month following a marked recovery. Over the past six months, the coin fell by about 52%, indicating a significant long-term decline. The data outlines a striking short-term rebound contrasting with an extended downtrend, highlighting market hesitancy. The noticeable monthly improvement suggests renewed investor interest despite ongoing challenges. The contrasting figures indicate a volatile market where short-term gains exist alongside broader weakness in the coin's performance. Current activity places Uniswap between a support at $4.33 and a resistance level at $10.08, with the trading range being $5.73 to $8.61. The coin is testing these key levels as traders seek opportunities for breakouts or reversals. Indicators, such as a mildly bullish RSI at 54.19, hint at buying pressure, yet the overall trend remains unclear. There is potential for trades; bullish participants may push toward $10.08, while bearish traders could aim for a dip to support. Monitoring price reactions near these levels, along with volume, is essential for position management. Conclusion As capital shifts from Bitcoin to altcoins, key projects to monitor include JUP , LINK , AAVE , and UNI . Each of these offers unique features and potential growth. JUP focuses on creating a secure ecosystem. LINK enhances interoperability between smart contracts. AAVE allows users to lend and borrow assets. UNI is the governance token for a leading decentralized exchange. Observing these projects could provide insights into emerging trends and opportunities within the market.

2025-07-05T00:00:59,"Bitcoin Traders Accumulate While MAGACOIN FINANCE Trades at $0.00011450 — Chainlink Sentiment Wanes","As the crypto market continues to rebound, Bitcoin traders are showing renewed signs of bullish accumulation, pushing market optimism higher even as some altcoins face mixed signals. While MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to hold the attention of early-stage meme-powered altcoin fans, Chainlink’s sentiment appears to be softening as technical signals point to a period of cautious consolidation. MAGACOIN FINANCE Stays Early-Stage, Community-Driven MAGACOIN FINANCE is a meme-driven altcoin and is also a decentralised political memecoin. It is gaining steady traction, while Bitcoin remains the anchor of the crypto market. It is currently trading at the minimum, and the strength of the project refers to how well it is developed and its community. MAGACOIN FINANCE is a unique, zero-tax, community-governed meme altcoin with political and cultural implications. Hashex has duly audited the coin’s token, and the project does not have VC control, unlike most other speculative meme coins, which lack absolute transparency. People who supported the coin in its earlier days do so because of its ideology, thousands of active holders, an ever-increasing Telegram presence, and decentralisation. Traders have kept MAGACOIN FINANCE on their watchlists due to rumours about upcoming exchange listings. At the same time, the narrative of early-stage momentum helps traders find culturally relevant tokens that transcend hype-driven pumps. Its hybrid identity, which combines the viral meme-coin energy with governance focus more commonly associated with larger altcoins, enables it to carve a distinct niche for itself. Bitcoin’s Bullish Momentum Gathers Pace Bitcoin’s market action this month has reinforced its reputation as the bellwether asset in the crypto market. Trading activity has surged to new yearly highs, with large derivatives traders and prediction markets reflecting growing confidence that BTC could push toward a fresh all-time high in the coming months. Current estimates place an 85% chance of Bitcoin hitting new record levels before October 2025, driven by improving liquidity, risk-on investor sentiment, and easing geopolitical tensions. Despite the optimism, short-term traders have recently locked in profits, with some data indicating that short-term holders have sold significant portions of their BTC holdings since May. This has resulted in a notable imbalance in the derivatives market, where bearish perpetual futures positions outnumber bullish longs by approximately two to one. Even so, the underlying trend remains upward as strong buy-side support keeps BTC trading well above $108,000, with analysts eyeing key resistance at $110,000 to $112,000. A breakout above these levels could open the door to further gains into the $125,000–$140,000 range. Chainlink Sees Cautious Sentiment By comparison, Chainlink (LINK) has shown signs of short-term weakness in recent sessions. As of July 2025, LINK is holding near the $13.30–$13.40 range, maintaining key support levels around $13.00. However, recent declines and an inability to reclaim the resistance levels around $13.86 to $14.36 have made some traders more cautious. On the fundamentals side, Chainlink remains a cornerstone of the blockchain data ecosystem. Its decentralised oracle services and the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) continue to attract real-world enterprise pilots and tokenisation partnerships. Yet, near-term momentum appears muted as broader market sentiment recalibrates. Analysts see potential for a bounce back into the $14.50–$15.00 range if sentiment improves. Still, any further weakness could push LINK into a deeper consolidation phase, with downside targets around $12.80 or lower. A Market Balancing Accumulation and Early-Stage Opportunity In a market where cultural tokens, foundational blockchains, and data providers all coexist, investors are watching for assets that offer a clear edge, whether that’s Bitcoin’s liquidity leadership, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s decentralised political narrative, or Chainlink’s oracle dominance. MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a unique opportunity for investors to get in early on an ecosystem with massive upsides.

2025-07-05T00:00:53,"XRP’s Time Is Now, Says Pundit—Don’t Snooze On The ‘Biggest Transfer Of Wealth’","Proponents of XRP are stepping up their pitch this week, calling the token “one of the greatest wealth transfers in history.” They argue it’s more than just another crypto. You’ll hear claims that XRP is already reshaping global finance and leaving old systems in the dust. According to influencer Coach JV, Ripple is building a whole new rails for money. He says XRP isn’t here to compete with banks. It’s here to replace them. Related Reading: Ethereum Network Awakens—Massive On-Chain Moves Signal What’s Coming He points out that transactions on the XRP Ledger settle in 3–5 seconds and cost fractions of a penny. That beats SWIFT transfers, which can take days and cost up to $50 per payment. XRP still trades around $2,25 but that figure, he argues, won’t stay low for long if the token keeps winning regulatory approvals and new partners. XRP is the most disruptive financial technology of our lifetime. Ripple isn’t just competing with the banking system, it’s replacing it. The old system is dead. The new financial rails are being laid right before your eyes. Stay asleep and you’ll miss the greatest wealth transfer… — Coach, JV (@Coachjv_) July 2, 2025 Ripple’s Technology Versus Legacy Rails Based on reports, RippleNet now counts more than 300 financial institutions in its network. Yet daily on‑chain volumes for XRP hover around $1 billion—small next to global cross‑border flows of roughly $150 billion per day. Banks are testing the tech, but most haven’t shifted large sums yet. That gap between tests and real‑world use is one reason XRP’s price has stayed below its all‑time high for seven years. Push For Regulatory Clarity XRP backers are watching the US carefully. They see growing buzz around spot XRP ETFs. Analysts like Eric Balchunas have given those filings up to 95% odds of approval by year‑end. If an ETF hits a US exchange, they say, more money will pour in. Ripple has also been chasing money‑transmitter licenses in Europe and Asia. Every new license, they believe, brings Ripple a step closer to mainstream use. Community Calls For Patience Coach JV keeps telling followers not to panic over a stagnant price. He uses phrases like “greatest wealth transfer in history” to drive home his point. In an earlier tweet, he promised “unimaginable wealth” for anyone who holds on. Other voices, such as commentator Edoardo Farina, point out that only about 1 to 2 million people hold XRP today. That number, they say, leaves room for 100 million or more newcomers—and more buyers often means higher prices. Related Reading: The Silent Bitcoin Accumulation: Public Companies’ Surprising H1 2025 Lead Analysts Caution Over Hype Even so, some experts urge caution. They note that bold forecasts don’t guarantee buy‑in from big banks or regulators. An ETF approval won’t force funds to rush in overnight. And test programs don’t always turn into full rollouts. For now, XRP remains a high‑risk play. Investors should track on‑chain metrics and regulatory milestones before getting swept up in the hype.

2025-07-04T23:45:46,"Chainlink’s Consolidation Echoes Bitcoin’s 2023 As Retail Apathy Meets Whale Hunger","Chainlink (LINK) remains locked in a $12-$15 price stalemate, owing to the continued whale accumulation amid retail disengagement. On-chain data shows sustained negative exchange netflows of around 100,000 LINK per week, which indicates that whale entities are absorbing sell pressure without significant price disruption. LINK Faces Critical Test CryptoQuant stated that this trend contrasts with occasional retail-driven spikes, such as March 2025’s 5 million LINK deposit surge. Retail activity has stayed flat, as evidenced by the daily active addresses hovering between 28,000 and 32,000, while transaction counts remain stagnant at around 9,000 per day. Despite increased oracle utility, retail failed to capitalize on a minor activity bump seen in late 2024. Whale urgency is evident as exchange withdrawals peaked at 3,000 transactions per day in Q4 2024 and remain elevated, thereby steadily draining exchange reserves, which have fallen approximately 40% year-to-date. Neutral leverage metrics are preventing volatility and have allowed systematic accumulation without triggering a breakout above $15. A resolution to this deadlock will require a spike in retail participation to ignite momentum or a slowdown in whale withdrawals to weaken accumulation. Until a catalyst emerges, LINK’s structure matches Bitcoin’s 2023 consolidation phase before its surge in 2024. While this accumulation standoff continues on-chain, Chainlink has been expanding its broader ecosystem through partnerships. Collaborations With Mastercard and Visa Last month, the decentralized oracle network partnered with Mastercard to allow 3 billion cardholders to purchase crypto directly on-chain using fiat payments. The collaboration utilizes interoperability infrastructure and Mastercard’s global network to remove barriers to crypto access. Partners like Zerohash, Shift4, Swapper Finance, and XSwap support liquidity, compliance, and fiat-to-crypto conversion, bridging traditional payments with decentralized finance environments. Chainlink also completed a pilot under the HKMA’s e-HKD+ initiative with Visa, wherein the duo tested cross-border investment transactions using CBDCs and stablecoins. In the trial, ANZ’s AUD-backed stablecoin A$DC was converted into e-HKD and used to invest in a tokenized money market fund. Chainlink’s CCIP enabled asset transfers between ANZ’s private blockchain and Ethereum’s public testnet, while Visa’s VTAP managed the token lifecycle. The pilot demonstrated instant, compliant investment fund access, which reduced settlement times from days to just seconds, even on weekends.

2025-07-04T23:36:05,"Bitcoin investors are up $1.2T in unrealized profit, but it's a double-edged sword","Bitcoin’s rally above $107,000 has delivered a spectacular windfall for investors, an estimated $1.2 trillion in unrealized profit, according to Glassnode’s latest on-chain data. Yet this massive pool of paper gains cuts both ways, signaling both strong bullish sentiment and a latent risk of sudden sell pressure. Bitcoin’s rally above $107,000 raised unrealized profits to around $1.2 trillion. Source: Glassnode Investors are HODLing on to their Bitcoins Despite the theoretical windfall, BTC investors have demonstrated notable restraint. Data shows that realized profits are declining, long-term holder supply has reached new highs, and selling pressure from short-term holders has eased. This mix of massive unrealized gains and cautious behavior is representative of the market’s current dynamics. Bitcoin recently saw a sell-off to about $99,000 prompted by geopolitical tension between Israel and Iran. Yet, prices rebounded to $107,000 after a cease-fire, with support emerging near the $98,300 cost basis of short-term holders—a level that analysts say consolidates the bullish narrative. Off-chain capital inflows from institutional sources, such as U.S. spot BTC ETFs , averaging $298 million per week, also bolster demand even as existing investors hold steady. The combination of patient holders and fresh institutional liquidity paints a picture of a deepening, mature market. However, the situation is precarious. While holding remains dominant, a shift in sentiment could unleash significant selling pressure. Analysts warn that current price levels are “insufficient to trigger significant profit-taking,” and note that the market may need to move higher (or lower) to unlock additional supply. History says pressure to sell is due Historical precedent amplifies the concern of wholesale profit-taking. CryptoQuant’s network unrealized profit/loss (NUPL) indicator has previously flashed sell signals when unrealized profits spiked, often ahead of market pullbacks. Similarly, previous reports note that long-term holders historically start spending and increasing sell-side pressure when their average unrealized gains reach around 350%, which reportedly happens near the $100,000 price zone. This suggests that rising prices could shift sentiment even among staunch holders, creating a feedback loop of profit-taking and price corrections. Despite these risks, the institutional cohort continues to strengthen Bitcoin’s market foundation. The Gemini‑Glassnode Q2 report shows over 30% of circulating BTC now resides in centralized entities, including ETFs, exchanges, custodians, and sovereign treasuries. Moreover, off-chain venues now account for over 75% of trading volume , signaling that price discovery is migrating toward regulated, institutional platforms. That’s a structural evolution that, while supporting liquidity, could also mean more organized and potentially sudden sell pressure from big stakeholders. Analysts continue to monitor the market Several analysts note that a meaningful price move, either surpassing the $110,000–$112,000 resistance or slipping below the recent $98,000–$99,000 support band, may be required to dislodge the market’s current equilibrium. As the market stands, Bitcoin’s $1.2 trillion in unrealized gains signals both its maturity and vulnerability. The enormous paper profits reflect investor confidence and institutional backing. At the same time, it signals a latent pool of potential selling fuel, one that could ignite if sentiment cracks or technical levels fail. For now, HODLing remains the dominant behavior, institutional inflows power momentum, and averages of realized profit and liveliness continue to decline.

2025-07-04T23:30:05,"Bitcoin Smashes $110k: Top 3 Altcoins That Are Set to Explode Next","Bitcoin has soared past the $110,000 mark , capturing global attention and sparking excitement in the crypto market. This surge sets the stage for other digital currencies to shine. Discover the top three altcoins poised for significant growth, ready to ride the wave of Bitcoin's impressive rally. Find out which coins are primed to take off next. SUI Price Recap: Past Weakness Followed by Recent Rally SUI experienced a 9.55% decline over the past month and a steep 44.39% drop over the last six months. A recent surge saw a 12.94% gain in the past week, indicating a brief recovery amid ongoing uncertainty. The price performance shows marked volatility, reflecting shifting market sentiment and periods of bearish pressure following significant downturns. The current trading range is between $2.19 and $3.48, with immediate resistance at $4.19 and support found at $1.59. Technical indicators present a mixed picture; momentum is modest, and the RSI hovers around 50, suggesting balance after the recent bounce, while other measures indicate lingering weakness. Bulls have gained recently, but the trend remains unclear. Traders might consider waiting near support levels for opportunities to buy, while sellers could target resistance levels. Cosmos (ATOM) Price Trends and Key Trading Levels Cosmos experienced a 7.5% drop over the past month and a steep decline of nearly 44% over the last six months. Price action over the past week showed a modest gain of about 4.8%, highlighting a coin that has struggled to maintain upward momentum. Overall, the trend points to ongoing weakness, with historical price behavior indicating a longer-term bearish sentiment. Despite the brief recovery, challenges remain in reversing the downturn, leaving investors cautious about future movement. The current trading band for Cosmos rests between $3.56 and $4.63. Immediate support is positioned at $3.03, with resistance at $5.16. The relative strength index around 48.51 reflects a balance between buying and selling pressures, though negative readings from momentum measures suggest bears remain dominant. The recent uptick hasn't significantly shifted the trend, prompting traders to watch for a potential bounce near support or a breakout at resistance as market conditions evolve. Ethena (ENA) Price Snapshot: Past Performance and Current Levels Over the past month, ETHENA experienced a notable drop of 22.18% from its price levels, while a one-week uptick of 5.04% offered a brief glimpse of recovery. Over the last six months, the coin suffered a steep decline of 78.64%. Price movements ranged between $0.2011 and $0.3549, marking clear volatility. Data shows that ETHENA’s performance has been considerably downbeat, emphasizing the impact of bearish market influences and investor caution. Currently, the coin trades within a range that sets a strong support at $0.13 and offers a nearest resistance of $0.44, with a second resistance level at $0.59. Trading decisions depend on whether bulls can push the price above these resistance areas or if bears will keep the coin anchored near its low points. The momentum indicator sits very low at -0.0049, suggesting bears dominate given the falling moving average. Traders might consider short-term buying opportunities near the support level or betting on a break above the $0.44 resistance. Conclusion As Bitcoin crosses the $110k mark, attention now shifts to other promising coins. SUI , known for its strong community and unique features, is expected to gain traction. ATOM shows potential due to its interoperability between different blockchains. ENA , with its innovative technology, could also see significant growth. These altcoins are positioned to perform well in the coming days. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-07-04T22:32:19,"Google’s Gemini AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Solana and Cardano by the End of 2025","Google’s Gemini predicts that leading altcoins may find new price highs through the latter part of 2025. See, in the last 24 hours Bitcoin rose to $109,997, which put it just 1.6% short of beating its historic price peak of $111,814 on May 22. Clearly bulls are looking to recapture that ground fast, which bodes well for various other leading cryptocurrencies, since Bitcoin clearly sets the pace of growth for the rest of the industry. This persistent market optimism has led many to believe that the next bull cycle could eclipse the legendary 2021 bull market, with altcoins expected to chart unprecedented highs. Here are several digital assets that Gemini has identified as having strong growth potential in the coming months. XRP (Ripple): Google’s Gemini Expects a Smooth Doubling for This Global Payments Leader According to Gemini’s forecasts, Ripple’s XRP could reach $20 by late 2025—effectively increasing ninefold from its present price of around $2.23. This positive projection is driven by growing institutional integration, strengthened regulatory clarity, and speculation regarding a potential XRP spot ETF approval, which would broaden access to institutional and retail buyers. XRP continues to enjoy worldwide recognition for facilitating quick, low-cost, and compliant cross-border payments. In 2024, the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) lauded XRP for its effectiveness in facilitating instant international remittances without intermediaries. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!! UN Endorses @Ripple and @StellarOrg as Cornerstones of New Global Payments Network! #XRP and #XLM will run the new financial system! pic.twitter.com/ufewexCKmR — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) October 13, 2024 A landmark U.S. court decision ruled that XRP’s retail sales did not constitute securities transactions, delivering a major setback to the SEC’s long-standing claims. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed in March that the protracted legal battle had finally concluded, removing a major obstacle and lifting market sentiment for XRP and the broader altcoin space. In the short term, resistance around $3 remains a key test. Should XRP surpass this barrier in the coming months, a move toward $5 (Gemini’s most conservative target) by year-end becomes increasingly feasible. However, getting to Gemini’s most ambitious target of $20 would require serious political developments, mainly a framework for regulating crypto in the US and a peaceful solution to the Middle East crisis. It’s also worth noting that XRP is clearly the best-performing coin among the projects with billionaire market caps. In the last 365 days, its price has risen 397% compared to Bitcoin’s meager 88%. Solana ($SOL): Gemini Projects This High-Throughput Blockchain Could More-Than-Treble by New Year Solana ($SOL) remains a formidable player in the smart contract ecosystem, second only to Ethereum in terms of decentralized application deployment and user activity. With its market cap now approaching $80.5 billion, SOL continues to attract developer interest and institutional funds. Speculation is mounting around the potential approval of a Solana spot ETF in the U.S., which could mirror the substantial capital inflows seen for Bitcoin and Ethereum after their ETF launches. Moreover, discussions of including SOL within a proposed U.S. digital asset reserve are enhancing its standing among large-scale investors. From a technical perspective, Solana has reversed its previous downtrend. After sliding from highs above $250 in January to lows near $100 in April, it recently broke out from a descending wedge pattern in early April—a formation typically viewed as bullish—and now trades for $150. Gemini’s projections place SOL at $500 by the end of 2025, up from its current trading price of around $150, more than tripling its value. A bullish summer could see SOL reaching $300, while a subsequent rise into the $500 range is considered well within reach. Some analysts even believe Solana can hit the the $1,000 milestone, but it would require the green light of US crypto legislation to catalyze such a big price movement. Cardano ($ADA): Google’s Gemini Predicts a Massive 10X Upsurge for This Smart Contract Pioneer Cardano ($ADA) was recently sighted in the crosshairs of US President Donald Trump, who took to his social media platform, Truth Social, to post a proposal to include ADA as part of a US Strategic Crypto Reserve strategy. Unlike Bitcoin, which the plan suggested the government could directly acquire, Cardano would be sourced exclusively via law enforcement seizures. Created by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, Cardano staked its reputation on a rigorous, research-driven development approach and emphasis on scalability and environmental sustainability. With a market valuation near $21 billion, ADA remains a key competitor to Ethereum and is closing in on rapidly growing blockchains like Solana. Gemini’s models suggest ADA could reach $5.66 by the end of this year—a near tenfold jump from its current level of $0.58. Technically, ADA has been consolidating within a descending wedge pattern since late 2024. A breakout above its $1.10 resistance could trigger a short-term rally toward $1.50. Under a strong bull market scenario, even Gemini’s most conservative upside target of around $3 could see ADA surpassing its previous all-time high of $3.09. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): Meme-Driven Layer-2 Solution Primed for a Breakout While Google’s Gemini excels in evaluating established assets, it may not fully account for the explosive potential of early-stage projects like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) . This presale-phase, meme-inspired Layer-2 protocol merges viral marketing with technical innovation. Although $HYPER is not yet trading on major exchanges such as Gemini, its presale has already raised over $1.9 million, with early backers eyeing potential 10X returns post-launch. Leveraging Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) architecture, Bitcoin Hyper integrates smart contract capabilities into the Bitcoin ecosystem through its proprietary Layer-2 network. Its Canonical Bridge supports rapid and cost-efficient transactions alongside an expanding suite of DeFi and NFT functionalities. Recent security audits by Coinsult found no key vulnerabilities, enhancing investor confidence. The native $HYPER token powers governance, staking, fees, and access to its ecosystem, while staking yields currently reach as high as 408% APY.
