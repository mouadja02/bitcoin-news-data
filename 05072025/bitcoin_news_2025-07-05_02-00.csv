2025-07-04T23:45:46,"Chainlink’s Consolidation Echoes Bitcoin’s 2023 As Retail Apathy Meets Whale Hunger","Chainlink (LINK) remains locked in a $12-$15 price stalemate, owing to the continued whale accumulation amid retail disengagement. On-chain data shows sustained negative exchange netflows of around 100,000 LINK per week, which indicates that whale entities are absorbing sell pressure without significant price disruption. LINK Faces Critical Test CryptoQuant stated that this trend contrasts with occasional retail-driven spikes, such as March 2025’s 5 million LINK deposit surge. Retail activity has stayed flat, as evidenced by the daily active addresses hovering between 28,000 and 32,000, while transaction counts remain stagnant at around 9,000 per day. Despite increased oracle utility, retail failed to capitalize on a minor activity bump seen in late 2024. Whale urgency is evident as exchange withdrawals peaked at 3,000 transactions per day in Q4 2024 and remain elevated, thereby steadily draining exchange reserves, which have fallen approximately 40% year-to-date. Neutral leverage metrics are preventing volatility and have allowed systematic accumulation without triggering a breakout above $15. A resolution to this deadlock will require a spike in retail participation to ignite momentum or a slowdown in whale withdrawals to weaken accumulation. Until a catalyst emerges, LINK’s structure matches Bitcoin’s 2023 consolidation phase before its surge in 2024. While this accumulation standoff continues on-chain, Chainlink has been expanding its broader ecosystem through partnerships. Collaborations With Mastercard and Visa Last month, the decentralized oracle network partnered with Mastercard to allow 3 billion cardholders to purchase crypto directly on-chain using fiat payments. The collaboration utilizes interoperability infrastructure and Mastercard’s global network to remove barriers to crypto access. Partners like Zerohash, Shift4, Swapper Finance, and XSwap support liquidity, compliance, and fiat-to-crypto conversion, bridging traditional payments with decentralized finance environments. Chainlink also completed a pilot under the HKMA’s e-HKD+ initiative with Visa, wherein the duo tested cross-border investment transactions using CBDCs and stablecoins. In the trial, ANZ’s AUD-backed stablecoin A$DC was converted into e-HKD and used to invest in a tokenized money market fund. Chainlink’s CCIP enabled asset transfers between ANZ’s private blockchain and Ethereum’s public testnet, while Visa’s VTAP managed the token lifecycle. The pilot demonstrated instant, compliant investment fund access, which reduced settlement times from days to just seconds, even on weekends.

2025-07-04T23:36:05,"Bitcoin investors are up $1.2T in unrealized profit, but it's a double-edged sword","Bitcoin’s rally above $107,000 has delivered a spectacular windfall for investors, an estimated $1.2 trillion in unrealized profit, according to Glassnode’s latest on-chain data. Yet this massive pool of paper gains cuts both ways, signaling both strong bullish sentiment and a latent risk of sudden sell pressure. Bitcoin’s rally above $107,000 raised unrealized profits to around $1.2 trillion. Source: Glassnode Investors are HODLing on to their Bitcoins Despite the theoretical windfall, BTC investors have demonstrated notable restraint. Data shows that realized profits are declining, long-term holder supply has reached new highs, and selling pressure from short-term holders has eased. This mix of massive unrealized gains and cautious behavior is representative of the market’s current dynamics. Bitcoin recently saw a sell-off to about $99,000 prompted by geopolitical tension between Israel and Iran. Yet, prices rebounded to $107,000 after a cease-fire, with support emerging near the $98,300 cost basis of short-term holders—a level that analysts say consolidates the bullish narrative. Off-chain capital inflows from institutional sources, such as U.S. spot BTC ETFs , averaging $298 million per week, also bolster demand even as existing investors hold steady. The combination of patient holders and fresh institutional liquidity paints a picture of a deepening, mature market. However, the situation is precarious. While holding remains dominant, a shift in sentiment could unleash significant selling pressure. Analysts warn that current price levels are “insufficient to trigger significant profit-taking,” and note that the market may need to move higher (or lower) to unlock additional supply. History says pressure to sell is due Historical precedent amplifies the concern of wholesale profit-taking. CryptoQuant’s network unrealized profit/loss (NUPL) indicator has previously flashed sell signals when unrealized profits spiked, often ahead of market pullbacks. Similarly, previous reports note that long-term holders historically start spending and increasing sell-side pressure when their average unrealized gains reach around 350%, which reportedly happens near the $100,000 price zone. This suggests that rising prices could shift sentiment even among staunch holders, creating a feedback loop of profit-taking and price corrections. Despite these risks, the institutional cohort continues to strengthen Bitcoin’s market foundation. The Gemini‑Glassnode Q2 report shows over 30% of circulating BTC now resides in centralized entities, including ETFs, exchanges, custodians, and sovereign treasuries. Moreover, off-chain venues now account for over 75% of trading volume , signaling that price discovery is migrating toward regulated, institutional platforms. That’s a structural evolution that, while supporting liquidity, could also mean more organized and potentially sudden sell pressure from big stakeholders. Analysts continue to monitor the market Several analysts note that a meaningful price move, either surpassing the $110,000–$112,000 resistance or slipping below the recent $98,000–$99,000 support band, may be required to dislodge the market’s current equilibrium. As the market stands, Bitcoin’s $1.2 trillion in unrealized gains signals both its maturity and vulnerability. The enormous paper profits reflect investor confidence and institutional backing. At the same time, it signals a latent pool of potential selling fuel, one that could ignite if sentiment cracks or technical levels fail. For now, HODLing remains the dominant behavior, institutional inflows power momentum, and averages of realized profit and liveliness continue to decline.

2025-07-04T23:30:05,"Bitcoin Smashes $110k: Top 3 Altcoins That Are Set to Explode Next","Bitcoin has soared past the $110,000 mark , capturing global attention and sparking excitement in the crypto market. This surge sets the stage for other digital currencies to shine. Discover the top three altcoins poised for significant growth, ready to ride the wave of Bitcoin's impressive rally. Find out which coins are primed to take off next. SUI Price Recap: Past Weakness Followed by Recent Rally SUI experienced a 9.55% decline over the past month and a steep 44.39% drop over the last six months. A recent surge saw a 12.94% gain in the past week, indicating a brief recovery amid ongoing uncertainty. The price performance shows marked volatility, reflecting shifting market sentiment and periods of bearish pressure following significant downturns. The current trading range is between $2.19 and $3.48, with immediate resistance at $4.19 and support found at $1.59. Technical indicators present a mixed picture; momentum is modest, and the RSI hovers around 50, suggesting balance after the recent bounce, while other measures indicate lingering weakness. Bulls have gained recently, but the trend remains unclear. Traders might consider waiting near support levels for opportunities to buy, while sellers could target resistance levels. Cosmos (ATOM) Price Trends and Key Trading Levels Cosmos experienced a 7.5% drop over the past month and a steep decline of nearly 44% over the last six months. Price action over the past week showed a modest gain of about 4.8%, highlighting a coin that has struggled to maintain upward momentum. Overall, the trend points to ongoing weakness, with historical price behavior indicating a longer-term bearish sentiment. Despite the brief recovery, challenges remain in reversing the downturn, leaving investors cautious about future movement. The current trading band for Cosmos rests between $3.56 and $4.63. Immediate support is positioned at $3.03, with resistance at $5.16. The relative strength index around 48.51 reflects a balance between buying and selling pressures, though negative readings from momentum measures suggest bears remain dominant. The recent uptick hasn't significantly shifted the trend, prompting traders to watch for a potential bounce near support or a breakout at resistance as market conditions evolve. Ethena (ENA) Price Snapshot: Past Performance and Current Levels Over the past month, ETHENA experienced a notable drop of 22.18% from its price levels, while a one-week uptick of 5.04% offered a brief glimpse of recovery. Over the last six months, the coin suffered a steep decline of 78.64%. Price movements ranged between $0.2011 and $0.3549, marking clear volatility. Data shows that ETHENA’s performance has been considerably downbeat, emphasizing the impact of bearish market influences and investor caution. Currently, the coin trades within a range that sets a strong support at $0.13 and offers a nearest resistance of $0.44, with a second resistance level at $0.59. Trading decisions depend on whether bulls can push the price above these resistance areas or if bears will keep the coin anchored near its low points. The momentum indicator sits very low at -0.0049, suggesting bears dominate given the falling moving average. Traders might consider short-term buying opportunities near the support level or betting on a break above the $0.44 resistance. Conclusion As Bitcoin crosses the $110k mark, attention now shifts to other promising coins. SUI , known for its strong community and unique features, is expected to gain traction. ATOM shows potential due to its interoperability between different blockchains. ENA , with its innovative technology, could also see significant growth. These altcoins are positioned to perform well in the coming days. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-07-04T22:32:19,"Google’s Gemini AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Solana and Cardano by the End of 2025","Google’s Gemini predicts that leading altcoins may find new price highs through the latter part of 2025. See, in the last 24 hours Bitcoin rose to $109,997, which put it just 1.6% short of beating its historic price peak of $111,814 on May 22. Clearly bulls are looking to recapture that ground fast, which bodes well for various other leading cryptocurrencies, since Bitcoin clearly sets the pace of growth for the rest of the industry. This persistent market optimism has led many to believe that the next bull cycle could eclipse the legendary 2021 bull market, with altcoins expected to chart unprecedented highs. Here are several digital assets that Gemini has identified as having strong growth potential in the coming months. XRP (Ripple): Google’s Gemini Expects a Smooth Doubling for This Global Payments Leader According to Gemini’s forecasts, Ripple’s XRP could reach $20 by late 2025—effectively increasing ninefold from its present price of around $2.23. This positive projection is driven by growing institutional integration, strengthened regulatory clarity, and speculation regarding a potential XRP spot ETF approval, which would broaden access to institutional and retail buyers. XRP continues to enjoy worldwide recognition for facilitating quick, low-cost, and compliant cross-border payments. In 2024, the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) lauded XRP for its effectiveness in facilitating instant international remittances without intermediaries. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!! UN Endorses @Ripple and @StellarOrg as Cornerstones of New Global Payments Network! #XRP and #XLM will run the new financial system! pic.twitter.com/ufewexCKmR — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) October 13, 2024 A landmark U.S. court decision ruled that XRP’s retail sales did not constitute securities transactions, delivering a major setback to the SEC’s long-standing claims. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed in March that the protracted legal battle had finally concluded, removing a major obstacle and lifting market sentiment for XRP and the broader altcoin space. In the short term, resistance around $3 remains a key test. Should XRP surpass this barrier in the coming months, a move toward $5 (Gemini’s most conservative target) by year-end becomes increasingly feasible. However, getting to Gemini’s most ambitious target of $20 would require serious political developments, mainly a framework for regulating crypto in the US and a peaceful solution to the Middle East crisis. It’s also worth noting that XRP is clearly the best-performing coin among the projects with billionaire market caps. In the last 365 days, its price has risen 397% compared to Bitcoin’s meager 88%. Solana ($SOL): Gemini Projects This High-Throughput Blockchain Could More-Than-Treble by New Year Solana ($SOL) remains a formidable player in the smart contract ecosystem, second only to Ethereum in terms of decentralized application deployment and user activity. With its market cap now approaching $80.5 billion, SOL continues to attract developer interest and institutional funds. Speculation is mounting around the potential approval of a Solana spot ETF in the U.S., which could mirror the substantial capital inflows seen for Bitcoin and Ethereum after their ETF launches. Moreover, discussions of including SOL within a proposed U.S. digital asset reserve are enhancing its standing among large-scale investors. From a technical perspective, Solana has reversed its previous downtrend. After sliding from highs above $250 in January to lows near $100 in April, it recently broke out from a descending wedge pattern in early April—a formation typically viewed as bullish—and now trades for $150. Gemini’s projections place SOL at $500 by the end of 2025, up from its current trading price of around $150, more than tripling its value. A bullish summer could see SOL reaching $300, while a subsequent rise into the $500 range is considered well within reach. Some analysts even believe Solana can hit the the $1,000 milestone, but it would require the green light of US crypto legislation to catalyze such a big price movement. Cardano ($ADA): Google’s Gemini Predicts a Massive 10X Upsurge for This Smart Contract Pioneer Cardano ($ADA) was recently sighted in the crosshairs of US President Donald Trump, who took to his social media platform, Truth Social, to post a proposal to include ADA as part of a US Strategic Crypto Reserve strategy. Unlike Bitcoin, which the plan suggested the government could directly acquire, Cardano would be sourced exclusively via law enforcement seizures. Created by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, Cardano staked its reputation on a rigorous, research-driven development approach and emphasis on scalability and environmental sustainability. With a market valuation near $21 billion, ADA remains a key competitor to Ethereum and is closing in on rapidly growing blockchains like Solana. Gemini’s models suggest ADA could reach $5.66 by the end of this year—a near tenfold jump from its current level of $0.58. Technically, ADA has been consolidating within a descending wedge pattern since late 2024. A breakout above its $1.10 resistance could trigger a short-term rally toward $1.50. Under a strong bull market scenario, even Gemini’s most conservative upside target of around $3 could see ADA surpassing its previous all-time high of $3.09. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): Meme-Driven Layer-2 Solution Primed for a Breakout While Google’s Gemini excels in evaluating established assets, it may not fully account for the explosive potential of early-stage projects like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) . This presale-phase, meme-inspired Layer-2 protocol merges viral marketing with technical innovation. Although $HYPER is not yet trading on major exchanges such as Gemini, its presale has already raised over $1.9 million, with early backers eyeing potential 10X returns post-launch. Leveraging Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) architecture, Bitcoin Hyper integrates smart contract capabilities into the Bitcoin ecosystem through its proprietary Layer-2 network. Its Canonical Bridge supports rapid and cost-efficient transactions alongside an expanding suite of DeFi and NFT functionalities. Recent security audits by Coinsult found no key vulnerabilities, enhancing investor confidence. The native $HYPER token powers governance, staking, fees, and access to its ecosystem, while staking yields currently reach as high as 408% APY.

MAGACOIN FINANCE has opened its Stage 3 presale amid surging interest. Bitcoin’s price forecasts continue to climb. XRP is gaining ETF traction. And Stellar, once a staple in cross-border conversations, is struggling to keep up. MAGACOIN FINANCE Stage 3: A Meme Coin With a Movement MAGACOIN FINANCE has formally launched Stage 3 of its rollout, building on a series of rapidly sold-out rounds. Community engagement is rising across its Telegram and social channels. Positioned as both a meme-powered altcoin and decentralized political memecoin, the project taps into cultural and ideological themes, all built around a capped 170 billion token supply. Its contract has been independently audited, and its zero-tax model appeals to traders looking for clean, community-first transactions. Analysts have taken note. With capital rotating out of slower-moving assets like Litecoin and even Ethereum in some cases, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a speculative favorite for those seeking high-risk, high-upside plays. Some early models forecast major returns if the token reaches broader listings later this year. Bitcoin: $125K Becomes a Real Target Bitcoin remains the bellwether, and its direction continues to influence capital flows across the market. Analysts at several major firms are now calling for BTC to hit $125,000 by mid-to-late 2025. Others, including Fundstrat’s Tom Lee, are floating more aggressive end-of-year targets in the $150K–$250K range. These projections aren’t just based on chart patterns. Renewed interest from institutional players, anticipation of U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts, and the ongoing supply squeeze (with over 95% of Bitcoin mined) are pushing bullish sentiment higher. While these forecasts are far from guaranteed, the tone across institutional reports has shifted firmly toward long-term accumulation. XRP: ETF Optimism and Regulatory Clarity Align XRP is also entering a strong narrative phase. Bloomberg analysts now assign a 95% probability to XRP ETF approvals in the coming months. If inflows mirror even a fraction of what Bitcoin ETFs attracted earlier this year, XRP could see a steep rerating in price. Behind this momentum is more than speculation. Ripple’s legal victory over the SEC earlier this year, combined with the lifting of institutional restrictions, has removed much of the regulatory uncertainty that once weighed on the asset. Institutional investors now view XRP as a viable component in portfolios with stable compliance exposure. Some models—even those on the conservative side—suggest that XRP could reach double-digit valuations under the right conditions, particularly if ETF inflows mirror past trends seen with Bitcoin products. Stellar: Utility Isn’t Enough Right Now In contrast to these rising names, Stellar (XLM) is finding it harder to maintain relevance. While its core use cases remain intact—especially for cross-border transactions and stablecoin integrations—the market hasn’t rewarded that stability. XLM is stuck below key resistance levels, hovering near $0.29 with $0.23 support acting as a critical floor. Despite partnerships with firms like MoneyGram and strong development credentials, investor sentiment appears muted. For now, it’s not a matter of fundamentals—it’s a matter of momentum. And Stellar doesn’t have it. Closing Thoughts Crypto in Q3 2025 is shaping up to be a contest of narratives and timing. Bitcoin is leading the market with renewed confidence. XRP is positioning itself as the next institutional access point. MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing early-stage attention through ideology, scarcity, and simplicity. Stellar may still have a role to play—but it will need to move fast to stay in the conversation. For now, the momentum is clearly shifting toward MAGACOIN FINANCE and its meme-fueled political movement To learn more about MAGACOIN FINANCE, visit: Website: https://magacoinfinance.com Twitter/X: https://x.com/magacoinfinance Telegram: https://t.me/magacoinfinance Continue Reading: MAGACOIN FINANCE Stage 3 Live — Bitcoin Eyes $125K, XRP Gets ETF Flows, and Stellar Struggles to Stay Relevant",bitcoinsistemi,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/%f0%9f%93%b0-magacoin-finance-stage-3-live-bitcoin-eyes-125k-xrp-gets-etf-flows-and-stellar-struggles-to-stay-relevant/,"BTC|XRP|MARKET|BUSINESS|TRADING","News",cryptocompare

2025-07-04T21:40:22,"Crypto Mining Surge: Mac-House Unveils Bold $11M Bitcoin Investment Strategy","BitcoinWorld Crypto Mining Surge: Mac-House Unveils Bold $11M Bitcoin Investment Strategy The landscape of traditional retail is undergoing a seismic shift, with established players increasingly eyeing the burgeoning world of digital assets. In a move that underscores this transformative trend, Japanese apparel giant Mac-House is making headlines, not for its latest fashion line, but for its audacious dive into the cryptocurrency sector. This isn’t just a tentative step; it’s a strategic leap that begins with a substantial Bitcoin investment and extends into the fascinating realm of crypto mining . What does this mean for the future of retail, and why are more companies following suit? Unpacking Mac-House’s Bold Bitcoin Investment Mac-House, a household name in Japanese retail, has signaled its serious intent by committing a significant 1.7 billion yen, approximately $11 million, into Bitcoin . This isn’t merely a speculative play; it’s a foundational move designed to integrate digital assets directly into their corporate strategy. For a traditional retailer, such an investment in a volatile asset like Bitcoin might seem unconventional. However, it reflects a growing confidence among corporations in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition as a store of value and a hedge against inflation, alongside its potential as a strategic asset for future digital services. This substantial capital allocation highlights a shift in corporate treasury management, where digital assets are no longer just an abstract concept but a tangible part of a diversified portfolio. It sets the stage for Mac-House’s broader ambitions in the Web3 space. The Strategic Leap into Crypto Mining Beyond simply holding Bitcoin, Mac-House is now actively entering the crypto mining sector. This expansion is being facilitated through a strategic partnership with Zero Field, a company likely providing the necessary infrastructure and expertise for mining operations. Mining Bitcoin involves using powerful computers to solve complex computational puzzles, thereby verifying and adding new transactions to the blockchain. In return, miners are rewarded with newly minted Bitcoin. This move offers several potential benefits: Direct Bitcoin Acquisition: Mining allows Mac-House to generate Bitcoin directly, potentially at a lower cost than market purchase, depending on electricity costs and mining difficulty. Revenue Diversification: It introduces a new revenue stream independent of traditional retail sales, potentially cushioning against market fluctuations in their core business. Deeper Industry Immersion: Engaging in mining provides Mac-House with hands-on experience and a deeper understanding of the underlying technology, crucial for future blockchain initiatives. However, crypto mining also comes with its own set of challenges, including high energy consumption, hardware costs, and the volatile nature of mining profitability, which is heavily influenced by Bitcoin’s price and network difficulty. Pioneering Digital Asset Management To spearhead its foray into the digital asset space, Mac-House has established a dedicated Digital Asset Management Group . This is a crucial development, indicating a structured and professional approach to integrating cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology into their business model. The creation of such a specialized group suggests: Strategic Oversight: A dedicated team ensures focused attention on managing crypto assets, assessing risks, and identifying new opportunities. Compliance and Security: It allows for the development of robust internal policies for compliance with regulations and the secure management of digital holdings. Future Innovation: This group will likely be at the forefront of exploring and implementing future blockchain and NFT services, ensuring Mac-House remains competitive in an evolving digital economy. This internal restructuring underscores the long-term vision Mac-House has for its crypto ventures, moving beyond a one-off investment to a sustained strategic pillar. What This Means for the Japanese Retailer Landscape Mac-House’s audacious move could serve as a significant precedent for other companies within the Japanese retailer sector and beyond. Japan has historically been at the forefront of technological adoption, and its regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is relatively developed. This bold step by a well-known retailer might encourage others to explore similar strategies, potentially leading to: Increased institutional adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. More companies venturing into crypto mining as a business diversification strategy. A greater integration of blockchain technology into loyalty programs, supply chains, and payment systems within the retail industry. The success or challenges faced by Mac-House will undoubtedly be closely watched by peers, potentially paving the way for a broader embrace of digital assets across the traditional business spectrum in Japan. Beyond Mining: Mac-House’s Future in Blockchain and NFTs The initial Bitcoin investment and subsequent entry into crypto mining are just the first phases of Mac-House’s ambitious digital strategy. CoinDesk Japan reported that the company has future plans to explore broader blockchain and NFT (Non-Fungible Token) services. This could encompass a wide array of possibilities: NFT Collections: Launching exclusive digital collectibles tied to their apparel lines or brand history. Blockchain-Based Loyalty Programs: Creating more engaging and transparent loyalty programs using tokenized rewards. Supply Chain Transparency: Utilizing blockchain to track the origin and journey of their products, enhancing transparency and trust for consumers. Metaverse Integration: Potentially establishing a presence in virtual worlds, offering digital fashion or experiences.

2025-07-04T21:30:14,"Bitcoin Futures Volume: Unveiling the Summer Slump’s Impact","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Futures Volume: Unveiling the Summer Slump’s Impact The cryptocurrency market, ever-dynamic and full of surprises, often reveals its underlying currents through subtle shifts in trading activity. Recently, a significant trend has emerged from the world of derivatives: Bitcoin futures volume has taken a noticeable dip. Is this just a temporary lull, or a signal of deeper market sentiment? Let’s dive into the data to understand what this seasonal shift means for the broader crypto landscape. What’s Happening with Bitcoin Futures Volume? According to insightful analysis from The Block, June witnessed a sharp 20% month-over-month decline in Bitcoin (BTC) futures volume, settling at approximately $1.55 trillion. This isn’t an isolated incident; rather, it marks a continuation of a pattern observed over the past three years – a consistent midyear slowdown. To put it into perspective, the average monthly volume for the first five months of 2025 stood significantly higher at $1.93 trillion. Significant Drop: A 20% reduction in monthly volume indicates a considerable decrease in institutional and large-scale trader activity. Historical Context: This dip mirrors similar trends seen in both 2023 and 2024, suggesting a predictable, seasonal pattern. Anticipated Rebound: The Block’s analysis concludes that volumes typically rebound later in the year, aligning with historical market cycles. This data on futures trading data offers a crucial window into the pulse of the market. While spot trading reflects immediate buying and selling, futures contracts provide a look at speculative interest and institutional positioning, making their volume a key indicator. Why the Seasonal Crypto Slowdown? The consistent midyear decline in Bitcoin futures volume begs the question: why does this happen? Several factors likely contribute to this “summer slump” phenomenon: Institutional Vacation Schedules: Many institutional traders and fund managers take their summer breaks during June, July, and August. This naturally leads to reduced activity and lower trading volumes. Reduced Retail Interest: Retail investors might also divert their attention from intensive trading during summer months, focusing on holidays and leisure activities. Macroeconomic Lull: Often, major macroeconomic announcements or significant policy shifts tend to slow down during the summer, leading to less volatility and thus less incentive for high-volume speculative trading. Market Consolidation: Periods of lower volume can sometimes indicate a phase of consolidation after periods of high volatility or significant price movements, as the market digests previous trends. Understanding these underlying reasons is vital for anyone tracking crypto market trends , as it helps differentiate between a genuine bearish sentiment and a predictable seasonal ebb. How Does This Impact BTC Price? While declining futures volume doesn’t directly dictate BTC price , it certainly influences market dynamics and sentiment. Lower liquidity in the futures market can lead to: Increased Volatility on Lower Volume: Smaller trades can have a disproportionately larger impact on price movements when overall volume is low, potentially leading to more erratic price swings. Reduced Price Discovery: With fewer participants and less capital flowing through the futures market, the efficiency of price discovery can diminish. Investor Caution: A sustained period of low volume might make some investors more cautious, waiting for clearer signals before committing significant capital. However, it’s also important to remember that these slowdowns are often followed by rebounds. Historical data suggests that the market often re-energizes in the latter half of the year, potentially setting the stage for renewed interest and upward price momentum for BTC price . Navigating the Current Crypto Market Trends For traders and investors, recognizing these crypto market trends is crucial for making informed decisions. Here are some actionable insights: Don’t Panic: A seasonal decline is not necessarily a sign of a fundamental market breakdown. Understand the historical context. Focus on Long-Term: For long-term holders, these periods can present opportunities for accumulation if prices dip due to low liquidity. Watch for Catalysts: Keep an eye out for potential catalysts in Q3/Q4, such as major conferences, regulatory developments, or significant technological upgrades, which could signal the end of the slowdown. Risk Management: During periods of lower liquidity, managing risk becomes even more critical. Consider smaller position sizes or wider stop-losses if actively trading. The current seasonal crypto slowdown offers a moment for reflection and strategic planning rather than reactive fear. It’s a natural part of the market’s ebb and flow. What’s Next for Futures Trading Data? As we move past the summer months, the expectation, based on historical futures trading data , is a gradual return of liquidity and increased activity. This typically aligns with: Return of Institutional Capital: As institutions resume full operations post-summer, their capital inflows tend to increase. Renewed Retail Interest: Retail traders often return with fresh capital and renewed enthusiasm as the year progresses. Year-End Rallies: Historically, the latter part of the year has seen increased market activity, sometimes leading to “year-end rallies” across various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Monitoring this rebound in Bitcoin futures volume will be key to gauging the market’s overall health and potential direction for the rest of the year. While the summer dip is a reality, it often serves as a prelude to a more dynamic second half. Conclusion: The Rhythm of the Crypto Market The recent decline in Bitcoin futures volume serves as a timely reminder of the cyclical nature of financial markets, including the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. This predictable summer slowdown, rooted in historical patterns and seasonal behaviors, is not necessarily a cause for alarm but rather an expected phase in the market’s annual rhythm. By understanding these crypto market trends and leveraging historical futures trading data , investors and traders can navigate these periods with greater confidence and strategic foresight. As the summer winds down, the anticipation builds for a potential resurgence in activity, reaffirming the resilience and long-term potential of Bitcoin and the broader digital asset space.

2025-07-04T21:30:05,"Bitcoin (BTC) vs. XRP: A Look at How One Was Designed to Be a ""Better Version"" of the Other","Bitcoin and XRP have long been vying for attention in the world of cryptocurrency. Each claims to offer unique advantages over the other. This article delves into their key differences and explores which digital currency may be poised for greater growth. Prepare to uncover the intricacies that set these two apart in the ever-evolving crypto landscape. Bitcoin Price Action: Steady Gains and Key Level Targets Over the past month, Bitcoin recorded a modest uplift with a 3.31% increase, hinting at a gradual recovery while maintaining a solid base. In the last six months, the coin showed a more robust rise of 11.07%, signaling growing confidence among traders and a general upward drift. Historical momentum suggests that price moves are building on previous gains, forming a foundation for further advances. The data reveals consistent, upward movement as traders gradually step in to buy on dips and take profits on incremental rises, indicating a market slowly shifting its tone. Current prices oscillate between approximately $100,205 and $112,347, with near-term resistance around $117,508 and support near $93,224. The levels suggest a trading range where bulls have stepped in to drive prices higher, but bears remain ready to defend lower bounds. There is no clear trend, indicating traders should stay alert to short-term reversals and false breakouts. Trading within these levels calls for caution; a break above resistance could spark renewed bullish momentum, while dips near support might offer buying opportunities. XRP’s Price Evolution and Technical Outlook In the last month, XRP showed a slight decline of 0.86% while over the past week it managed a modest gain of 5.72%. Over the past six months, the coin experienced an 8.07% drop, marking a period of subdued momentum with mixed performance. The price oscillated between $1.99 and $2.41, reflecting a phase where gains and losses balanced out without a clear, dominant direction. The current trading range places XRP between $1.99 and $2.41, with a key support level at $1.73 that may serve as a potential entry point for buyers. Immediate resistance is seen at $2.59, while a secondary resistance at $3.02 and a lower support at $1.31 offer additional markers for trading decisions. Recent technical indicators hint at some upward pressure, suggesting potential bullish interest. Traders might consider a buy setup near the $1.73 support, while planning strategies if the price struggles at the $2.59 barrier. Keeping watch on these levels is essential as market dynamics shift. Conclusion BTC and XRP have different purposes and strengths. BTC aims to be a decentralized digital store of value. XRP focuses on improving the existing banking system with faster transactions. Each has unique features that cater to different needs in the financial ecosystem. Both play important roles in the evolving world of blockchain technology and finance.

Imagine, a massive trove of Bitcoin, untouched for over a decade, suddenly springing to life. This is precisely what unfolded recently, sending ripples of speculation and excitement across the digital asset landscape. A Bitcoin address, silent since 2010, made significant transfers, immediately prompting questions: Who is behind this monumental move? And what does it mean for the broader market? This isn’t just about large sums of money; it’s a peek into the very early days of Bitcoin, a time when only a few pioneers truly understood its potential. Let’s dive deep into this fascinating development and uncover the insights from a leading voice at Coinbase. Decoding the Bitcoin Whale Phenomenon In the vast ocean of cryptocurrency, a “Bitcoin whale” refers to an individual or entity holding an exceptionally large amount of Bitcoin. These are the titans whose movements can send significant waves through the market. When such a whale, especially one that has been dormant for an extended period, makes a move, it becomes a focal point of discussion and analysis. Why? Because their actions can signal shifts in sentiment, potential market direction, or simply reflect the personal decisions of early adopters who are now sitting on immense fortunes. The recent activity from a wallet that had remained untouched for 14 years is a prime example of a whale making its presence known. This isn’t just any large holder; this is a holder from Bitcoin’s nascent stages, a true veteran of the decentralized revolution. The sheer volume of BTC involved means that any transaction from such an address is scrutinized intensely by analysts, traders, and enthusiasts alike, all eager to decipher the underlying intentions and potential market repercussions. The Awakening of Dormant Bitcoin : What Happened? On a seemingly ordinary day, the crypto community was abuzz with news of substantial Bitcoin transfers originating from an address that had been dormant since 2010. For over a decade, the coins within this wallet lay untouched, a digital time capsule from Bitcoin’s infancy. The transfers involved a significant portion of the address’s holdings, instantly catching the eye of blockchain analytics firms and crypto observers. Conor Grogan, the Director of Product Strategy and Business Operations at Coinbase, quickly weighed in on the unfolding mystery. Taking to X (formerly Twitter), Grogan provided crucial context, suggesting that the substantial BTC likely belonged to a single miner from 2011. This insight immediately narrowed down the possibilities, shifting the narrative from a random, forgotten wallet to a deliberate move by an early and highly successful participant in the Bitcoin network. Grogan’s analysis highlighted the scale of this miner’s early operations: The miner once consolidated an astonishing 180 block rewards. At its peak in 2011, this miner held an address containing 200,000 BTC. This particular wallet was, at one point, among the top five largest Bitcoin wallets ever recorded. At today’s prices, 200,000 BTC would be valued at an staggering $22 billion, underscoring the immense wealth accumulated by these early pioneers. The activation of such a significant amount of dormant Bitcoin is a rare event, often sparking both excitement and apprehension. While some view it as a potential sell-off signal, others see it as a re-allocation or diversification, or simply an early adopter finally realizing their incredible gains. Who is the 2011 Bitcoin Miner Behind the Moves? While the exact identity of the 2011 Bitcoin miner remains shrouded in the pseudonymous nature of blockchain, Conor Grogan’s detailed commentary provides the most compelling insights to date. His research suggests this isn’t a random accumulation but rather the systematic mining efforts of a dedicated individual or group during Bitcoin’s formative years. In 2011, Bitcoin was still largely unknown outside of niche tech communities. Mining was accessible with standard computer hardware, and block rewards were a generous 50 BTC per block. The fact that this miner accumulated 180 block rewards points to a significant, sustained operation. This wasn’t a casual hobbyist; this was someone deeply committed to the early network, contributing substantial hashing power when the network was still fragile and its future uncertain. Their foresight and dedication have now translated into a fortune that dwarfs the wealth of many traditional billionaires. The mystery surrounding their identity adds to the allure. Are they a forgotten genius, an academic, a cypherpunk, or simply someone who stumbled upon a goldmine? The blockchain offers transparency in transactions but maintains privacy regarding identities, creating these intriguing puzzles that fuel the imagination of the crypto community. The re-emergence of this miner serves as a powerful reminder of Bitcoin’s early days and the incredible foresight of its earliest adopters. Analyzing the Impact of Bitcoin Whale Moves When a whale of this magnitude makes Bitcoin whale moves , the market often holds its breath. The primary concern is usually a potential sell-off, which could flood the market with supply and put downward pressure on prices. However, the reality is often more nuanced. Large transfers don’t always equate to immediate sales. There are several reasons why a long-dormant whale might move their funds: Consolidation: Moving funds to new, more secure addresses. Diversification: Shifting some Bitcoin into other cryptocurrencies or traditional assets. Custodial Changes: Transferring assets to a regulated custodian or an institutional wallet. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deals: Selling large blocks of BTC directly to institutional buyers without impacting exchange liquidity. Security Upgrades: Migrating from older, potentially less secure wallet formats to newer, more robust ones. Estate Planning: Preparing for inheritance or distribution. While the initial reaction might be fear, a closer look often reveals a more complex picture. For instance, if the funds are moved to an exchange, it could signal an intent to sell. However, if they are moved to a new, unknown address, it’s more likely a security-related transfer. The immediate market reaction to this specific whale’s movements was relatively subdued, suggesting that the market absorbed the news without significant panic, possibly due to the expectation of OTC deals or non-selling transfers. The movements of such large holders also provide valuable data for market analysts. They can help identify long-term holder behavior, assess network health, and even gauge the confidence of early adopters in Bitcoin’s continued trajectory. It serves as a powerful testament to the long-term holding strategy, often referred to as “HODLing,” that has become a cornerstone of the Bitcoin community. Stay Ahead with the Latest Cryptocurrency News The saga of the 2011 Bitcoin miner is a compelling narrative that underscores the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. Staying informed about such significant events is crucial for anyone involved in the crypto space, from seasoned investors to curious newcomers. The world of digital assets is constantly evolving, with new developments, regulatory changes, technological advancements, and market shifts occurring at a rapid pace. Understanding the implications of large Bitcoin whale moves , the awakening of dormant Bitcoin , and the historical context provided by figures like the 2011 Bitcoin miner offers invaluable insights. It helps in making informed decisions, managing risk, and identifying potential opportunities. Relying on credible sources and expert analysis, such as that provided by Coinbase executives, is paramount in navigating this complex landscape. Whether it’s tracking the latest price action, delving into blockchain technology, or understanding the macroeconomic factors influencing crypto, continuous learning is key. The story of this re-emerging whale reminds us that even assets dormant for over a decade can suddenly become a major talking point, highlighting the long-term potential and enduring mystique of Bitcoin. Conclusion: The Enduring Legacy of Early Bitcoiners The recent movements from a 14-year dormant Bitcoin address, attributed by Coinbase executive Conor Grogan to a prolific 2011 miner, serve as a powerful testament to the incredible foresight and perseverance of Bitcoin’s earliest adopters. This event isn’t just about billions of dollars; it’s a living piece of Bitcoin history unfolding before our eyes. It highlights the potential for immense wealth creation from pioneering contributions to a then-nascent technology, and it underscores the decentralized, transparent, yet often pseudonymous nature of the blockchain. As the crypto market continues to mature, the actions of these early whales will always remain a subject of fascination and analysis. Their moves offer a rare glimpse into the long-term vision of those who built the foundation of this revolutionary financial system. This particular miner’s awakening reinforces Bitcoin’s resilience and its enduring ability to surprise and captivate the world.

It's an incredibly volatile ecosystem where fortunes are made and lost within hours. This space rewards the informed and punishes the ignorant. You cannot thrive in the cut-throat sector without adequate knowledge, discipline, and consistency. In this context, adequate knowledge refers to being familiar with several key concepts, including how to maximize your crypto investments, harness trends, and control risks. The hacks outlined below will get you started. Maximizing Your Crypto Investments In the current market, which is replete with high volatility, rapid growth, and constant innovation, you must prioritize maximizing your crypto investments. To do that, first visit the AvaTrade educational website. Here you can gain a better understanding of how to trade crypto alongside other popular financial instruments. After learning the basics, set clear investment goals. That will help you build your portfolio, gauge progress over time, and make the necessary adjustments. While setting your investment goals, consider crucial factors like what you plan to achieve, your risk tolerance, and time horizon. Finally, try to put idle crypto assets to work through lending, staking, and yield farming. Harnessing Market Trends A single social media post can send a crypto asset to the moon. Conversely, a regulatory rumor or concern can tank a coin's value. That's just how the crypto market is. You must harness market trends to stay ahead, enjoy maximum returns, and minimize losses. In other words, go with the tide and avoid swimming against the current whenever you can. Harnessing market trends requires you to do your homework.

Controlling Risk Volatility isn't a bug in the world of crypto investing – it's an inherent feature. A coin can pump by over 100% within less than a day, or crash within a matter of minutes. Take $Trump as an example. This meme coin's value rose by over 300% overnight immediately after its launch, only to lose approximately 90% of its value within 24 hours. The sudden price changes led to both massive profits and losses. You must mitigate your risk exposure to avoid enormous losses and remain in the crypto investing game for a long time. First, obey the golden rule of investing: only risk capital you can afford to lose. Secondly, set stop-loss and take-profit orders. Last but not least, you should hold your assets in secure wallets and optimize their protection with protocols like 2FA and biometric authentication.

Sadly, thousands have also lost tons of money to volatile digital assets like Bitcoin, Solana, and Ethereum. Use the tips discussed here to avoid getting wiped out and squeeze every penny from crypto investing. Finally, and this can't be overemphasized, never invest what you can't afford to lose.

Strömmer called for more effective use of the new confiscation law that came into effect in November last year. Thanks to the new legal regulation, if authorities suspect that a person's assets are derived from criminal proceeds and the person cannot explain the source of these assets, these assets can be seized without a conviction. “We are calling on the institutions to increase their cooperation and increase the pressure even further, with a particular focus on assets that generate large profits,” Strömmer said. So far, assets worth 80 million Swedish crowns (about $8.4 million) have been seized. The law also applies to children and mentally ill individuals, according to the Swedish parliament's website.

A groundbreaking announcement from Russia’s state-owned defense giant, Rostec , is set to redefine the landscape of national digital payments. In a move that signals a profound commitment to embracing blockchain technology, Rostec has revealed plans to launch its own ruble-pegged stablecoin, RUBx stablecoin , alongside a comprehensive payment platform called RT-Pay. Slated for a 2025 rollout, this initiative is not just about creating a new digital asset; it’s about integrating cutting-edge technology into the very fabric of Russia’s economic infrastructure. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and those monitoring global digital currency trends, this development presents a fascinating case study in how nations are navigating the complex intersection of traditional finance and decentralized innovation. What is the RUBx Stablecoin and Why Tron Blockchain? At the heart of Rostec’s ambitious project lies the RUBx stablecoin , a digital currency designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged 1:1 to the Russian ruble. This stability is crucial for any digital asset aiming for widespread adoption in everyday transactions, shielding users from the notorious volatility often associated with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. The choice of the Tron blockchain as the underlying technology for RUBx is particularly noteworthy. Tron, known for its high transaction throughput and low fees, offers a robust and scalable infrastructure that can handle the anticipated volume of digital payments. This selection underscores a strategic decision to leverage an established, efficient public blockchain rather than developing a proprietary one from scratch, potentially accelerating development and deployment. Stablecoins like RUBx serve as a bridge between the traditional financial system and the burgeoning world of decentralized finance (DeFi). They offer the speed and transparency of blockchain transactions while mitigating price risk. For Russia, a ruble-pegged stablecoin could offer several advantages: Efficient Cross-Border Transactions: Potentially streamlining international trade, especially with partners amenable to digital assets. Reduced Transaction Costs: Lowering fees associated with traditional banking transfers. Enhanced Financial Inclusion: Providing easier access to digital payments for a wider segment of the population. Programmable Money: Enabling smart contracts for automated payments and complex financial agreements. The decision to utilize an existing, popular blockchain like Tron also implies a degree of interoperability and accessibility that a closed, private blockchain might not offer, potentially fostering broader adoption among external wallets and platforms. Unveiling the RT-Pay Platform: A Game Changer for Russian Digital Payments Complementing the RUBx stablecoin is the RT-Pay platform , envisioned as a comprehensive digital payment ecosystem. According to state news agency TASS, RT-Pay is designed to integrate seamlessly with Russia’s existing banking system, allowing for a smooth transition for users accustomed to traditional financial services. This integration is paramount for widespread adoption, ensuring that digital payments powered by RUBx can flow freely between conventional bank accounts and the new blockchain-based system. The platform’s features are designed to cater to a diverse range of economic sectors, with a particular emphasis on security and innovation: Feature Description Potential Impact Banking System Integration Enables direct transfer of funds between traditional bank accounts and RT-Pay digital wallets. Facilitates mass adoption, reduces friction for users. External Wallet Support Compatibility with various non-custodial and custodial digital wallets. Increases accessibility and user choice, fostering a broader ecosystem. Smart Contracts Automated, self-executing agreements with the terms directly written into code. Enables new business models, enhances transparency and efficiency in transactions. Compliance & AML Adherence to local laws and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. Ensures legality and security, builds trust with regulators and users. The emphasis on compliance with local laws and anti-money laundering (AML) rules is a critical aspect, distinguishing RT-Pay from more unregulated crypto ventures. This commitment to regulatory adherence is likely to build trust among businesses and individuals, paving the way for wider acceptance within the established financial framework of Russia. The platform’s focus on supporting various economic sectors, from retail to industrial, suggests a broad vision for its utility, positioning it as a foundational layer for future digital economic activity. Russia’s Digital Currency Ambitions: A Strategic Imperative? The development of the RUBx stablecoin and RT-Pay platform by Rostec is not an isolated event but rather fits into a broader narrative of Russia’s digital currency ambitions. In recent years, global powers have been exploring central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and other forms of digital money to modernize financial systems, enhance payment efficiency, and maintain monetary sovereignty. For Russia, the geopolitical context, particularly the imposition of international sanctions, has likely accelerated the push towards alternative payment mechanisms that are less reliant on traditional Western-dominated financial infrastructure. While RUBx is a stablecoin issued by a state-owned company rather than a direct CBDC issued by the central bank, it shares many strategic objectives with a CBDC: providing a secure, efficient, and sovereign digital payment rail. This initiative could serve as a testing ground for broader digital ruble adoption or even complement a future official CBDC. The goal is clear: to enhance financial independence and create resilient payment systems that can operate effectively regardless of external pressures. This move by Rostec, a key player in Russia’s defense and industrial sectors, signals a high-level strategic endorsement of blockchain technology for national economic interests. It represents a proactive step to adapt to a rapidly evolving global financial landscape where digital assets are becoming increasingly central. The Promise and Peril: Benefits and Challenges of Rostec’s Initiative Every innovative leap comes with its own set of promises and perils. Rostec’s venture into the RUBx stablecoin and RT-Pay platform holds immense potential benefits for Russia’s economy, but it also faces significant challenges that will determine its ultimate success. Understanding both sides of the coin is crucial for a balanced perspective. Potential Benefits: Economic Efficiency: Streamlined transactions, reduced settlement times, and lower operational costs across various sectors. Enhanced Security: Blockchain technology offers inherent security features, reducing fraud and increasing transparency for digital payments. Innovation Catalyst: The platform’s support for smart contracts could foster new business models and innovative financial products within Russia. Financial Sovereignty: Less reliance on traditional international payment systems, offering greater control over domestic and cross-border transactions. Improved Accessibility: Providing digital payment solutions to unbanked or underbanked populations, fostering greater financial inclusion. Challenges and Considerations: Regulatory Hurdles: Navigating the complex and evolving regulatory landscape for digital assets, ensuring full compliance while fostering innovation. Public Adoption: Overcoming inertia and building trust among the general populace and businesses to encourage widespread use of a new digital payment system. Cybersecurity Risks: Despite blockchain’s inherent security, any large-scale digital platform remains a target for sophisticated cyberattacks, requiring continuous vigilance. Technological Scalability: Ensuring the Tron blockchain and RT-Pay platform can handle the immense transaction volume required for a national payment system. Interoperability: Ensuring seamless interaction with existing financial systems and potentially with other national or international digital currencies. The success of this initiative will heavily depend on Rostec’s ability to address these challenges effectively, building a robust, secure, and user-friendly system that instills confidence and delivers tangible benefits to the Russian economy. Looking Ahead to 2025: The Impact of RUBx and RT-Pay The year 2025 marks a pivotal moment for Russia’s digital currency aspirations with the anticipated launch of RUBx and RT-Pay. This timeline suggests a carefully planned rollout, allowing for rigorous testing, regulatory alignment, and public education. The impact of such a system could be far-reaching, transforming various facets of the Russian economy. For instance, in the realm of B2B payments, smart contracts on RT-Pay could automate supply chain financing, significantly reducing administrative overhead and payment delays. For consumers, the integration with external wallets means more flexible and potentially cheaper ways to send and receive money, pay for goods and services, and manage personal finances digitally. Furthermore, the initiative could position Russia as a leader in leveraging blockchain technology for state-backed financial instruments, potentially influencing other nations considering similar moves. The collaboration between a defense industry giant like Rostec and the financial sector highlights a convergence of strategic national interests with technological innovation. While the primary focus appears to be domestic economic enhancement and resilience, the long-term implications for international trade, particularly with countries in the BRICS bloc and beyond, cannot be overlooked. A successful RUBx and RT-Pay could lay the groundwork for a more diversified and independent global financial architecture, driven by digital assets. Conclusion: Paving the Way for a Digital Tomorrow Rostec’s announcement of the RUBx stablecoin and RT-Pay platform represents a significant stride in Russia’s journey towards a more digitized and resilient financial future. By leveraging the efficient Tron blockchain and integrating with existing banking infrastructure, this initiative aims to create a secure, compliant, and innovative payment ecosystem. While challenges such as regulatory complexities and public adoption remain, the strategic imperative for enhanced financial sovereignty and efficiency is clear. As 2025 approaches, the world will be watching closely to see how this ambitious project unfolds and reshapes the landscape of Russia’s digital currency and beyond. This bold move by Rostec could indeed be a blueprint for how state-backed entities embrace blockchain, signaling a new era for national digital economies.

According to ZachXBT’s statement on his personal channel, C&M Software, one of the service providers of the Brazilian Central Bank, was the target of a massive cyberattack worth approximately $140 million (800 million reais). The incident occurred on June 30, 2025, when six different financial institutions gained unauthorized access to their reserve accounts at the Central Bank. The attackers converted the fiat money they obtained from these accounts into digital assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Tether (USDT) via over-the-counter (OTC) markets and cryptocurrency exchanges in Latin America. According to ZachXBT, at least $30 million to $40 million was converted into cryptocurrencies. Related News: Major Update News Arrives for Altcoin Whose Price Has Plummeted Over the Past Year What’s even more striking is that the attackers purchased the company’s login information from one of C&M Software’s employees for just 15,000 reais (about $2,760). According to information from Brazilian security services, this simple access created a gap worth millions of dollars. ZachXBT stated that it has been tracking funds, helping to freeze some accounts, and trying to identify OTC brokers who are conducting illegal transactions. It also stated that the wallet addresses related to the incident will be shared with the public at the appropriate time. However, it was also noted that despite this serious security breach, the incident received almost no media coverage outside of Brazil. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-04T20:17:25,"Sweden’s crypto crackdown: police told to seize digital assets ‘without proof of crime’","Sweden’s Justice Minister has reportedly ordered law enforcement to ramp up seizures of unexplained crypto holdings—even without direct evidence of a crime. The directive hinges on a controversial law that could redefine asset forfeiture in the digital age. On July 4, Decrypt reported that Sweden’s Justice Minister Gunnar Strömmer issued a formal call for law enforcement, tax authorities, and the national Enforcement Authority to intensify confiscations of crypto assets suspected of being tied to illicit activity. The directive is based on a law passed last November that grants authorities sweeping powers to seize digital assets, even without definitive proof of criminal conduct, if the owners cannot adequately explain their origins. Since its introduction, the law has already been used to seize $8.4 million in property, marking one of Europe’s most aggressive stances on unexplained wealth. According to the report, Strömmer emphasized the importance of improving inter-agency coordination, particularly when dealing with high-value assets like cryptocurrency, stating it was “time to turn up the pressure.” You might also like: Ondo Finance to acquire SEC-regulated broker-dealer Oasis Pro Why Sweden is targeting crypto with aggressive seizure powers Justice Minister Strömmer’s push appears to stem from mounting concern over digital assets’ role in Sweden’s organized crime economy. A September 2024 report from Sweden’s Police Authority and Financial Intelligence Unit found that some cryptocurrency exchanges function as de facto money laundering services—facilitating the flow of drug money, fraud proceeds, and other criminal revenue. The report explicitly urged law enforcement to “increase its presence” on crypto trading platforms to help identify and dismantle such operations. Meanwhile, recent figures from the Bloomsbury Intelligence & Security Institute estimate that roughly 62,000 individuals were involved in or linked to criminal networks in Sweden as of 2024. While data on crypto-specific crime remains sparse, authorities cite the anonymity and cross-border capabilities of digital assets as key enablers of organized crime. These concerns likely fueled Strömmer’s argument that Sweden’s asset forfeiture laws must evolve to match the realities of financial crime in the digital era. One of the most vocal supporters of Strömmer’s crackdown is Sweden Democrat Dennis Dioukarev, a prominent advocate for a national Bitcoin reserve. Dioukarev argues that seized crypto, particularly Bitcoin ( BTC ), should be transferred to Sweden’s central bank, the Riksbank, to build a strategic reserve. “Cryptocurrencies confiscated from criminals should be repurposed to strengthen Sweden’s financial position,” Dioukarev said in the report, framing the move as a way to turn crime-fighting into a long-term economic asset. Still, the government’s silence on what will actually happen to confiscated crypto has raised questions. When pressed, Strömmer’s office declined to clarify whether seized assets would be liquidated, held, or directed into a national reserve.

The transaction between Bitcoin and Cardano was facilitated by BitVMX, an interoperability protocol built using the BitVM programming language and unveiled at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. Why is ORDI down? ORDI is in a bear run this year. The drop in the ORDI value could be attributed to the market’s correction from the bull run in the last quarter of 2024. Will ORDI recover? ORDI is trading at its lowest this year and is ripe for a reversal. It should recover in the coming months. Will ORDI reach $50? Yes, ORDI should rise above $50 in 2027. The move will come as the market recovers to previous highs. Will ORDI reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, ORDI will reach $100 in 2029 and reach a maximum price of $130.84. Will ORDI reach $1,000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely that ORDI will get to $1,000 before 2030. What is the prediction for Ordi in 2030?

According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, ORDI will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is ORDI a good investment? ORDI had the first-mover advantage on the Ordinals protocol. ORDI, like Bitcoin, has a capped supply of 21 million coins and should, therefore, become scarce over time.

ORDI’s historic price sentiment ORDI price history by CoinGecko According to CoinMarketCap, ORDi started trading in May 2023 at $25.3466. It later fell, reaching its lowest value of $2.86 in September 2023. Binance listed ORDI on November 17, 2023. However, due to a lack of clear information from Binance, there needed to be more clarity, leading many to mistakenly believe that ORDI was a direct product of the Ordinals protocol. This misunderstanding contributed to ORDI’s dramatic market performance. The meme coin saw a 40% increase in value within a single day, culminating in a 100% rise over four days. Despite these fluctuations, ORDI’s popularity surged, and by the end of 2023, its price had climbed above $50. ORDI peaked in March 2024, hitting an all-time high of $96.17. It later moved into a bear run, and by April, it had already dropped by 50%. It started recovering in November, rising above the $35 mark, and $48 in December. In 2025, the trend quickly reversed and fell below $12 in February and $8 in May.

A judge has granted preliminary approval for a settlement that will hand $177 million to people affected by the breaches. The first breach is believed to have happened back in 2019, with hackers stealing sensitive data from 7.6 million current and 65.4 million former customers. Although AT&T believes the data may have been taken from one of its vendors, the firm has acknowledged that data including customers’ social security numbers, names and dates of birth was exposed. The second breach happened last year, when hackers breached the company’s Snowflake cloud workspace environment, stealing smartphone call and text metadata of nearly 110 million customers from May of 2022 to October of 2022. People who can prove they suffered financial damages as a result of the data breaches will likely receive a larger share of the payout. At time of publishing, affected customers are expected to receive notice of eligibility by mail or email, with the claims process coming in August.

2025-07-04T20:00:27,"Bitcoin Investors Hoarding $1,200,000,000,000 in Unrealized Profits, According to Glassnode – Here’s What It Means","Investors have accumulated hundreds of billions of dollars in unrealized profits on Bitcoin ( BTC ) as the crypto king hovers just below the all-time high, according to analytics platform Glassnode. The analytics platform says Bitcoin investors are sitting on $1.2 trillion in unrealized profits as “HODLing remains the dominant behavior.” “Despite this surge in profitability, investor behavior signals a strong preference for HODLing, as the current price range appears insufficient to trigger significant profit-taking. This is reflected in declining realized profits, a continued downtrend in Liveliness, and Long-Term Holder supply climbing to a new all-time high.” Liveliness is an on-chain indicator that is used to determine the holding behavior, with a decrease suggesting Bitcoin is being held for longer periods and vice versa. The Long-Term Holder supply metric is used to categorize the total circulating supply based on how long the coins have been held – an increase in the supply suggests coins are being held for lengthy periods. According to the analytics platform, the $1.2 trillion in unrealized profits that Bitcoin investors are sitting on could provide an “incentive for potential sell-side pressure” if sentiment shifts or if the crypto king moves out of the present price range. “Despite this surge in profitability, investor behavior signals a strong preference for HODLing, as the current price range appears insufficient to trigger significant profit-taking.” Compared to other recent periods when Bitcoin broke above the previous all-time high prices, Glassnode says the profits Bitcoin investors are booking are at relatively lower levels. “Around $872 million worth of is currently being locked in profit per day, which is notably less that the $2.8 billion and $3.2 billion in realized profit seen during the $73,000 and $107,000 all-time high formations, respectively.” Bitcoin is trading at $109,422 at time of writing.

2025-07-04T20:00:01,"Bitcoin Price To See 52% Increase To $166,000, Analyst Reveals Tight Timeline","Bitcoin has been gaining strength over the past several days, with price action relaying the buying interest from institutional players. A surge of inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs helped push the price to $109,758, followed shortly after by another move to around $110,386 in the past 24 hours. This brings Bitcoin within close proximity to its price peak just above $111,000. Now that momentum is clearly leaning bullish, technical analysis shows a breakout that could see Bitcoin increase by another 52% within the next three months. Fibonacci Extension Model Points To $166,000 Price Target CryptoCon shared a chart based on Fibonacci extensions that places the next major upside target at $166,754. This level corresponds to the 5.618 Fibonacci ratio and marks a projected 52% increase from the current region around $109,000. The analyst highlighted how previous Fibonacci extension levels like $30,362, $46,831, $71,591, and $109,236, have all aligned with important points for Bitcoin’s price action throughout the ongoing cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Makes History With Highest Monthly Close, But Volume Is Still Bearish According to CryptoCon, this model has consistently tracked Bitcoin’s moves over the past two years. As shown in the price chart below, the 1.618, 2.618, 3.618, and 4.618 Fibonacci extension levels have all been reached this cycle, with the latest being $109,236 at the 4.618 Fib level. Keeping this in mind, the next Fibonacci extension level is at 5.618, which corresponds to $166,754. The $166,000 mark has remained unchanged as the cycle’s next projection. But although the timing has proven difficult to nail down, the structure of the chart is still intact and continues to validate the target. Bitcoin’s price action is currently sitting just above the 4.618 extension level, and a 52% rally from here would complete the pattern. Revised Timeline Pushes Target To September Although the projection for $166,000 is still consistent, the timeline to reach it has undergone several adjustments. CryptoCon estimates that Bitcoin could reach the $166,000 level by September; however, he also acknowledged that the forecast has shifted several times. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price At $145,000 In September? Bullish Dojis Suggest Upward Move He explained that the current cycle has taken longer than any previous one, which has caused earlier predictions to be delayed. To put this in perspective, Bitcoin’s current cycle began in late 2022 after it reached a bottom around $15,000 during the bear market. This means the current bull phase has dragged on for almost three years. Still, data has shown over and over that the cycle is not finished, and so the only thing left to do is to wait. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $109,110.

2025-07-04T19:55:05,"Crypto Analyst Benjamin Cowen Issues Altcoin Alert, Says Alts Primed To Keep Going Lower Against Bitcoin – Here’s Why","A widely followed cryptocurrency analyst is issuing an alert, warning traders that altcoins appear poised to continue declining against Bitcoin ( BTC ). In a new thread, crypto trader Benjamin Cowen tells his 1 million followers on the social media platform X that US monetary policy will remain tight, suggesting that altcoin pairs versus the top crypto asset by market cap are heading to their range lows. “With the economy holding strong, it delays rate cuts and likely delays the end to QT [quantitative tightening]. This suggests that monetary policy will remain restrictive, continuing to support the idea that altcoin/BTC pairs are likely still heading to the range lows.” Source: Benjamin Cowen/X According to Cohen, during the last two summers, altcoin pairs versus BTC would rally before dipping during Q4, a move he believes could happen again. “The last 2 summers ALT/BTC pairs found some brief relief before heading lower into Q4. The larger bounce by ALT/BTC pairs over the last few years did not occur until November.” Source: Benjamin Cowen/X TOTAL3, or the entire market cap of all crypto assets excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH ), is sitting at $827.5 billion at time of writing, a 2.3% decrease on the day. Cowen concludes his analysis by telling traders not to confuse ALT/BTC pairs with USD/BTC pairs, which behave in different ways. “Does anyone understand the difference between ALT/BTC and ALT/USD or are people just going to keep pretending they are the same thing? This is the difference between ALT/USD and ALT/BTC pairs. ALTs keep bleeding to BTC but have gone up on their USD pairs.

The Humanity ( H ) token gained as most altcoins dipped amid Bitcoin ( BTC )’s slip from highs of $110k on Friday. Losses for BTC came amid a massive 80,000 Bitcoin transfer by wallets that had stayed dormant for over 14 years, and saw Ethereum, XRP and Solana among other top digital assets retreat to support levels. However, Humanity’s native token defied the downturn as its price surged from lows of $0.072 to above $0.108. The daily gains, accompanied by a 74% spike in trading volume to over $481 million, extended the cryptocurrency’s weekly rally to over 400%.

One key driver is the launch of Humanity trading pairs against the Korean won, with South Korea-based crypto exchange Bithumb adding the H/KRW pair on Thursday. The token has surged following this listing, largely due to the significant retail demand that often accompanies listings on Korean exchanges. $H is coming to @BithumbOfficial later today! 🖐️ https://t.co/fPCikbPoT1 — Humanity Protocol 「 🖐️ ✦ 🇺🇳 」 (@Humanityprot) July 3, 2025 Market data shows the H/KRW pair had seen over $46 million in 24-hour volume on Bithumb – volumes that are comparable to those recorded on some of the platforms offering Tether ( USDT ) pairs.

Other than spot trading, H is also available for perpetual futures. Humanity secured a $20 million funding round at a $1.1 billion valuation in January 2025. The round was led by Pantera Capital and Jump Crypto.

2025-07-04T19:52:39,"Dormant Bitcoin Whales Move $2B After 14 Years","Two of the all-time great Bitcoin whale wallets, which had lain dormant since 2011, have mysteriously come back to life and shifted a combined 20,000 BTC—over $2 billion at today's prices—out of them to brand-new addresses. The cinematic resurrection of these Satoshi-era wallets has once again sparked controversy about Bitcoin's real circulating supply, the destiny of lost coins, and the possibility of fresh volatility as the market teeters at all-time highs. Following the Whale Transactions The two wallets, both of which were opened back in April 2011 when Bitcoin traded for just $0.78, each moved 10,000 BTC on 4th July 2025. The moves were first pointed out by Blockchain analysts at Whale Alert and Lookonchain before other on-chain data accelerated verification. The BTC, now worth over $1 billion per wallet, had remained completely dormant through three bear markets, the collapse of Mt. Gox, and Bitcoin's run to over $110,000. Most significantly, the coins were not being deposited onto exchanges, but into other fresh addresses, causing speculators to suspect the owner may be upscaling wallet security or preparing for future transactions rather than selling. This intel has fueled gossip on social media outlets, with some speculating the wallets could be owned by Satoshi Nakamoto or other early Bitcoin influencers, while others suggest possible links to Silk Road or recently pardoned individuals. Market Volatility and Impact Signals Historically, the re-appearance of long-dormant Bitcoin addresses—specifically ones of such magnitude—has been a signal for market volatility. While these particular transactions have yet to mean pressure in the form of selling (since the coins did not move to exchanges), the psychological impact to the market is enormous. Traders and experts look closely at such whale activity as potential indicators of supply shocks or price volatility. Real-time on-chain analysis presents the information that while some of these vintage whales have sold during 2025's rally, there are still most coins in such Satoshi-era wallets remaining off exchanges, limiting near-term risk of downside. CryptoQuant data presents the news that the exchange whale ratio has actually fallen, meaning fewer whales selling out and a more ”natural” market environment. Even then, the mere possibility of these coins surfacing on the market at some point is sufficient to keep traders on their toes. What Previous Whale Reactivations Mean for Bitcoin In the past, whale reactivations on a large scale have happened during periods of heightened volatility and, at times, local market tops. However, not all dormant wallet movements translate into a sell-off. Whales sometimes simply upgrade security, roll coins into new custody solutions, or set up for inheritance and estate planning. Recent movements, to non-exchange addresses, suggest no immediate seller intent, but they also re-raise the question of how much Bitcoin supply is truly ”lost” vs simply dormant. On-chain data also shows that the percentage of long-term holders' Bitcoin supply is near all-time highs despite some of the older coins moving. Such action is double-edged: it can prop up prices by reducing circulating supply, yet impulsive whale movement can quickly change sentiment.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9814/dormant-bitcoin-whales-move-2-b-after-14-years,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-07-04T19:46:49,"President Putin blames energy deficits for the creeping ban on crypto mining across Russia","President Putin of Russia has blamed growing energy deficits caused by the booming minting of digital currencies for a creeping ban on crypto mining across his country. Putin’s comments on the matter follow a recent increase in electricity prices which, as analysts predict, is likely to affect the business of companies mining Bitcoin in the Russian Federation. Governors asked for it, Putin says of Russian mining ban Electricity shortages resulting from the rapid growth of crypto mining are the main reason for Moscow’s decision to ban the activity in certain regions, Russian President Vladimir Putin explained during an event devoted to discussing development initiatives. Local officials dealing with the issue have been urging the federal government to do something as they are facing insufficient energy supplies needed for various infrastructure and industry projects, Russia’s head of state revealed, quoted by the Kremlin. Speaking about the need to maintain a balanced approach to exploiting Russia’s resources during the plenary session of the “Strong Ideas for a New Time” forum, organized by the Agency for Strategic Initiatives, Putin gave crypto mining as an example: “We were recently happy we had a surplus of electricity in some regions. But they began actively mining there, and governors started complaining to me they did not have enough electricity to develop their regions. We were forced to make certain decisions in the mining sphere.” The concerns of local authorities highlighted by the Russian leader have so far led to seasonal or permanent restrictions on cryptocurrency mining in many corners of the vast country. A full ban , until 2031, has been imposed in almost a dozen territories, from Siberia to the North Caucasus and occupied Ukraine, although some regions were recently spared with federal officials warning that tax and energy revenues may take a hit. Higher electricity rates also hurt Russian miners Meanwhile, electricity costs in Russia have gone up since July 1. According to a report by the business news portal RBC, tariffs for power transmission via Russia’s national grid will increase by 11.5% by the end of 2025 and the rates charged by local distributors will jump by 11.6%. Electricity is arguably the biggest expense for mining enterprises as their hardware consumes significant amounts of electric energy. The latest generation device can burn about 2.5 MW a month, and industrial-size minting facilities have thousands of these mining machines constantly running. While most mining firms take into account the usual annual indexation of energy prices in advance, this year’s increase is outstripping inflation and threatens to reduce the competitiveness of Russia’s mining sector as a whole, according to Oleg Ogienko, expert on blockchain, energy, and digital finance. The analyst remarked that both customers of Russian mining companies and investors, especially foreign investors, are already choosing other, more favorable jurisdictions, such as the United States, where, in his words, a real mining boom is currently taking place. Russia legalized cryptocurrency mining with a law signed by Vladimir Putin in August 2024. Under the legislation, legal entities and private individuals are allowed to mint digital coins as long as they register with the Federal Tax Service and pay their due taxes. Only about 30% have done so . Low electricity rates and, in some cases, a surplus of generating capacities, turned places like the Siberian Oblast of Irkutsk into mining hotspots over the past few years. Then, the resulting power deficits were met with government prohibitions. Industry watchers claim, however, that the restrictive measures are mostly hurting legal mining businesses. To address the issue, Russian authorities are considering alternative options such as moving crypto farms to energy-rich regions, in the North, for example, while cracking down on illegal mining activities throughout the country, and more specifically in energy-deficient regions.

2025-07-04T19:45:00,"Bitcoin community abuzz as 14-year-dormant wallets move $2 billion","The bitcoin world lit up on Friday after two wallets holding a combined 20,000 BTC — untouched since 2011 — suddenly came to life, sparking speculation, awe, and some market caution. Blockchain trackers Whale Alert and Lookonchain were the first to flag the transfers, noting that each wallet contained 10,000 BTC. When the coins were initially acquired, bitcoin traded at just $0.78. At current levels near $108,868, each wallet now holds more than $1.09 billion — a staggering unrealized gain of over 139,000%. The activation of long-dormant wallets has become a rare but closely watched event in the crypto space, given the potential for large-scale sell-offs and their market impact. A rising trend of old bitcoin awakening Data from blockchain analytics firm Onchain School shows that the movement of older bitcoin is not just a one-off phenomenon this year. According to the group, 62,800 BTC that had remained unmoved for more than seven years was activated between January and March 2025. That marks a 121% increase from the 28,000 BTC moved during the same period in 2024. The reason for this uptick remains uncertain, though analysts point to the sharp rise in bitcoin’s value and the surge in institutional interest following the launch of US-regulated spot bitcoin ETFs as possible drivers. Bitcoin’s price has climbed 16% so far this year and set a new record above $110,000 in May. Still, the mystery surrounding the identities and intentions of the dormant wallet holders remains intact. There has been no indication that the recent transfers are part of a planned sale. HODLers or sellers? The market watches closely Caroline Bowler, CEO of Melbourne-based BTC Markets, said the action is consistent with early bitcoin adopters who embraced a “HODL” — hold on for dear life — strategy during the volatile early years of crypto. “What is remarkable is the amount of self-control that it would have taken through all these market cycles to sit on it for that long,” Bowler told MarketWatch . Bowler noted that if the owners do intend to sell, doing so in a single trade could destabilize the market. However, she expects that any sales would likely occur through over-the-counter (OTC) channels, spread out over time to minimize market disruption. Bowler said there are a number of “dormant wallets out there with significant holdings of bitcoin that are unlikely to ever be activated because people have lost the access to it. And that’s what makes it particularly of interest within the bitcoin community when you see one of these things like back up again.” Speculation builds amid bullish long-term forecasts For now, the wallet holders appear to remain long-term believers in bitcoin’s potential. But with BTC sitting at all-time highs and high-profile forecasts making the rounds, many are watching for signs of a shift. Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, recently reiterated his bullish stance, forecasting that bitcoin could reach $250,000 by the end of 2025 in a best-case scenario. His base case remains at $150,000. Lee said in an interview last month that with “95% of the world still not owning bitcoin,” the supply-demand imbalance leaves significant upside. The sudden reawakening of long-dormant whales could signal rising conviction, nervousness, or just a quiet reshuffling. Either way, in a market as sentiment-sensitive as crypto, the ripples are being felt far and wide.

2025-07-04T19:42:09,"World Famous E-Sports Giant Announces It Will Enter Bitcoin Mining Industry! Here Are the Details","NIP Group, the umbrella company of the world-famous e-sports organization Ninjas in Pyjamas (NiP), announced that it has entered the Bitcoin mining industry. Esports Giant Ninjas in Pyjamas Gets Into Bitcoin Mining: Aims to Produce $6.5 Million in BTC Monthly The company aims to produce 60 BTC per month by purchasing a series of mining rigs with a total computational power of 3.11 EH/s (exahash/second), which corresponds to a production value of approximately $6.5 million at current prices. However, this production represents gross income; net income may differ once expenses such as electricity and operating costs are deducted. NIP Group has established a new unit to manage mining operations and make strategic decisions regarding the BTCs mined: Digital Computing Division. Although the company has not yet given details on how it will evaluate Bitcoins, this new division will also take responsibility for future mining investments. “We Are Not Just a Gaming Company Anymore” NIP Group co-founder and co-CEO Hicham Chahine said in a statement on LinkedIn that after the company went public last year, they wanted to create revenue models in areas other than esports and entertainment. Chahine emphasized that Bitcoin mining stands out as a “related and innovative” area and that they will continue to expand in this area. “We are no longer just a gaming company. We are transforming into a digital infrastructure company fit for the entertainment era,” Chahine said, noting that they are investing in real computing power and operational capacity. But investors don’t seem to have welcomed the decision so far. The company’s shares have fallen 17% since the announcement on Tuesday, falling to $2.13. They have fallen 88% since their peak of $17.76 in July 2024. NIP Group’s move sees institutional firms joining the trend of building bitcoin reserves, much like MicroStrategy’s pioneering model. Led by MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor, the model has led to a 3,300% increase in the company’s stock, turning it into a major crypto asset investor. However, experts remind that this approach carries risks due to high volatility and that companies may have to sell BTC if they are in trouble. NIP Group's new direction shows that gaming giants are now trying to grow not only through content production, but also through digital infrastructure and asset management. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-04T19:27:06,"Sanctioned Russian Giant Rostec Bypasses Banks with Tron-Based RUBx Stablecoin","Rostec, a major Russian state-owned defense conglomerate, has found a way to bypass traditional banking systems. It has revealed its intention to introduce its RUBx stablecoin alongside RT-Pay, a specialized platform designed for cryptocurrency-based transactions. The RUBx token, which maintains a 1:1 peg to the Russian ruble , will function on the TRON blockchain network. In a July 3 company statement , Rostec indicated that both the stablecoin and RT-Pay platforms would function as secure payment mechanisms for commercial entities and retail users. Russia’s state-owned conglomerate Rostec plans to launch a fiat-backed stablecoin called RUBx later this year, built on the Tron blockchain. RUBx will be pegged 1:1 to the Russian ruble and aims to drive ruble digitization through the RT‑Pay payment platform.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) July 4, 2025 Why the RUBx Stablecoin Could ‘Kill SWIFT’ for Russian Payments Despite US Sanctions Rostec asserts that the platform operates in full compliance with Russian regulatory frameworks, including Central Bank requirements and anti-money laundering protocols designed to prevent terrorist financing. “ Each RUBx token is supported by genuine ruble-denominated obligations. This backing is legally secured. The token maintains a one-to-one ratio with the actual ruble. We plan to launch the system within this year, with Rostec acting as the primary operator ,” stated Rostec Deputy General Director Alexander Nazarov. Rostec has operated under comprehensive US sanctions since June 2022, implemented following Russia’s military invasion of Ukraine. These restrictions, enforced by multiple nations, including the United States and European Union, target Rostec’s subsidiary companies and affiliated entities. The sanctions seek to limit Russia’s military production capacity and its capabilities in weapons manufacturing. Industry observers have characterized the RUBx stablecoin initiative as Russia’s strategic attempt to circumvent SWIFT , the international financial messaging system supervised by G-10 central banks, including the United States. This interpretation gains credibility given that Russia’s Central Bank has explicitly stated in recent years that its primary objective in developing a digital ruble is to provide Russian corporations and financial institutions with “independence from SWIFT.” Russia’s ‘Crypto Shift’: State-owned Firms Use Blockchain To Beat Dollar Dominance Regarding the forthcoming RUBx stablecoin, Rostec confirmed that the RT-Pay platform will integrate with existing banking infrastructure, allowing digital payment processing and interaction with external cryptocurrency wallets and smart contracts. The RUBx token, built on Justin Sun’s TRON blockchain , will have its source code made publicly available on GitHub and undergo verification and security auditing by CertiK, an independent international blockchain security firm. Russia also appears to be increasingly embracing cryptocurrency as a method to circumvent international sanctions. Recently, the Russian Agricultural Bank (RusAg) announced it is collaborating with the Bank of Russia to assess digital asset-based payment solutions for grain export transactions. Russia is exploring ways to use cryptocurrencies to settle grain export payments, as the country looks to bypass Western sanctions. #Russia #Crypto https://t.co/zCSTnCTLEJ — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 2, 2025 Irina Zhachkina, RusAg’s First Deputy CEO, characterized cryptocurrencies as a “ practical alternative instrument ” for international payments, particularly as sanctions continue restricting Russia’s access to conventional financial systems. Russian grain exporters are facing mounting pressure from restrictions that affect logistics, shipping insurance, and access to the SWIFT banking network. These constraints have increasingly complicated Russian companies’ ability to conduct transactions in US dollars or euros. Both the RUBx stablecoin initiative and grain settlement mechanisms build upon Russia’s previous experience utilizing cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Tether (USDT) for oil trade settlements with China and India . China and Russia are reportedly using Bitcoin to settle energy trades, marking a significant shift in global trade dynamics and de-dollarization. #Bitcoin #Energy https://t.co/UVJDN4rZSv — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 10, 2025 State-owned enterprises are also simultaneously developing proprietary blockchain services. For example, in March, Gazprom, Russia’s majority-state-owned energy giant, launched a series of tradable blockchain-powered “digital financial assets” (DFAs) . Similarly, Rostelecom, Russia’s largest telecommunications and digital services provider, issued two proprietary DFAs on the Moscow Exchange earlier that month. Additionally, Russia appears to be leveraging cryptocurrency and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) as countermeasures against international sanctions. In May, Russian media outlet RBC reported that the central bank had established regulatory guidelines governing the use of cryptocurrency by Russian firms in international trade agreements. These regulations specify that digital currencies “must not be associated with securities issued by hostile issuers” and emphasize the necessity of engaging with projects that maintain a presence in “friendly countries.” The post Sanctioned Russian Giant Rostec Bypasses Banks with Tron-Based RUBx Stablecoin appeared first on Cryptonews .",cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/sanctioned-russian-giant-rostec-bypasses-banks-with-tron-based-rubx-stablecoin/,"BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|BTC|ASIA|ETH","Blockchain News|News|Russia|Stablecoin",cryptocompare
