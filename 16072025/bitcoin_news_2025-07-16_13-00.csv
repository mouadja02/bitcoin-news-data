2025-07-16T10:53:08,"AI predicts Bitcoin price for August 1, 2025","Bitcoin ( BTC ) is likely to trade around $130,000 at the start of August, according to insights from two artificial intelligence (AI) models, driven by sustained institutional demand and supportive macroeconomic conditions. As of press time, Bitcoin was trading at $119,166, up over 2% in the past 24 hours and nearly 10% over the past week. After climbing to a record high above $123,000, the cryptocurrency slightly pulled back but is now pushing toward the $120,000 resistance level. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold ChatGPT predicts Bitcoin price For the outlook, both OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Grok agree the market remains firmly bullish, supported by strong inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs , growing adoption in emerging markets, and easing global inflation. ChatGPT projects Bitcoin will reach $130,000 by August 1, citing steady, though slowing, upward momentum as the bull market matures. The model sees Bitcoin trading in a range of $125,000 to $135,000 through late summer, with potential upside if ETF demand accelerates or new sovereign buyers emerge, and downside risk from regulatory shocks or typical bull-market corrections.

The model highlighted bullish technical signals, such as a strong MACD and elevated relative strength index ( RSI ), while cautioning about potential short-term pullbacks as traders take profits. Both models stress that their forecasts are speculative, given Bitcoin’s notorious volatility and susceptibility to external shocks. However, they agree that the current stage of the market cycle, roughly 12 to 18 months after the April 2024 halving, still favors higher prices into late 2025. Meanwhile, market sentiment around Bitcoin remains strong, with the Fear & Greed Index at 70, indicating “Greed.” The price continues to hold above the 50-day ($107,744) and 200-day ($88,894) simple moving averages , confirming the uptrend. However, the 14-day RSI at 68 suggests the asset is nearing overbought territory, while volatility remains moderate at 4.44%.

2025-07-16T10:50:02,"Peter Thiel’s Bold Move: Acquires Stake in BitMine, a Major Ethereum Treasury Holder","BitcoinWorld Peter Thiel’s Bold Move: Acquires Stake in BitMine, a Major Ethereum Treasury Holder The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with news that could signal a significant shift in institutional adoption. Peter Thiel, the visionary co-founder of PayPal and a prominent figure in venture capital, has made a strategic move that has caught the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike. His recent acquisition of a substantial stake in BitMine Immersion Technologies, a Bitcoin mining company, isn’t just another investment; it’s a profound statement, especially considering BitMine’s considerable Ethereum (ETH) treasury. This development raises crucial questions about the evolving landscape of digital assets and the future of institutional engagement with cryptocurrencies. What does this bold move signify for the broader market? Unveiling Peter Thiel’s Strategic Crypto Play When a name like Peter Thiel enters the fray, the market pays attention. Known for his groundbreaking work at PayPal, his co-founding of Palantir Technologies, and his influential venture capital firm, Founders Fund, Thiel has a track record of identifying and investing in disruptive technologies. His past commentary on Bitcoin has often been bullish, viewing it as a “store of value” and even a “Chinese financial weapon” against the U.S. dollar, highlighting its geopolitical significance. However, his direct investment in a publicly traded crypto mining firm, especially one with such a diverse crypto holding, marks a tangible commitment. This isn’t Thiel’s first foray into the crypto space. Founders Fund has previously invested in various crypto-related ventures. Yet, acquiring a 9.1% stake in BitMine Immersion Technologies, as disclosed to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), signals a deeper, more direct involvement. It suggests a conviction that the infrastructure supporting cryptocurrencies, specifically mining operations, represents a valuable long-term asset. This strategic play by Thiel could serve as a powerful signal, potentially encouraging other mainstream institutional investors to explore similar opportunities in the digital asset ecosystem. Understanding BitMine: More Than Just Bitcoin Mining At its core, BitMine Immersion Technologies is a Bitcoin (BTC) mining company. Listed on the New York Stock Exchange, it operates facilities dedicated to the energy-intensive process of validating transactions and creating new Bitcoin. Their business model revolves around deploying high-performance mining rigs, often utilizing immersion cooling technology to optimize efficiency and longevity. This focus on industrial-scale Bitcoin production aligns with the growing trend of publicly traded mining companies seeking to capitalize on the increasing demand for decentralized digital currencies. However, what truly sets BitMine apart and makes Thiel’s investment particularly intriguing is its substantial treasury of Ethereum (ETH) . While primarily a Bitcoin miner, BitMine holds an astonishing 163,142 ETH. To put that into perspective, at recent valuations, this stash is worth approximately $500 million. This significant Ethereum holding transforms BitMine from a pure-play Bitcoin miner into a company with substantial exposure to both of the world’s largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. It raises questions about their asset management strategy and whether this dual exposure is a deliberate diversification or a result of historical accumulation. The Ethereum Treasury: A Golden Hoard in BitMine’s Vault The presence of such a massive Ethereum (ETH) treasury within a Bitcoin mining company is highly noteworthy. Why would a company primarily focused on mining Bitcoin accumulate such a large amount of Ether? Several possibilities come to mind: Strategic Diversification: Holding ETH could be a deliberate strategy to diversify their crypto assets, mitigating risks associated with reliance solely on Bitcoin’s price movements. Yield Generation: With Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake, this ETH could potentially be staked to generate passive income, providing an additional revenue stream for BitMine beyond just Bitcoin mining rewards. Historical Accumulation: It’s possible the ETH was acquired during earlier phases of the crypto market or through specific investment decisions that predated their current public profile as a Bitcoin miner. Future Development: The ETH treasury could be earmarked for future projects, perhaps related to decentralized finance (DeFi) or other Web3 initiatives, leveraging Ethereum’s robust ecosystem. Regardless of the exact rationale, this substantial Ethereum holding provides BitMine with significant financial flexibility and a unique position in the market. It offers a strong balance sheet asset that can be leveraged for various corporate objectives, making the company more attractive to investors like Peter Thiel who recognize the long-term value of diversified crypto exposure. Bitcoin’s Enduring Appeal: BitMine’s Core Mining Business While the Ethereum treasury adds an fascinating layer, it’s crucial to remember that BitMine’s foundational business remains Bitcoin (BTC) mining. Bitcoin, as the pioneer cryptocurrency, continues to dominate the market in terms of market capitalization and institutional adoption. Its scarcity, decentralized nature, and role as a digital store of value have attracted significant interest from traditional finance. Peter Thiel has consistently expressed his belief in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. His investment in a Bitcoin mining operation reaffirms his conviction that the underlying infrastructure supporting the network is a critical component of the crypto economy. Mining companies like BitMine play a vital role in securing the Bitcoin network, processing transactions, and introducing new supply into circulation. As Bitcoin continues to gain traction as a global reserve asset, the profitability and strategic importance of robust mining operations are likely to increase, further validating Thiel’s investment thesis. What This Crypto Investment Means for the Market Peter Thiel’s latest crypto investment in BitMine is more than just a headline; it’s a barometer for the evolving relationship between traditional finance and the digital asset space. Here’s what it signifies: Increased Institutional Confidence: A high-profile investor like Thiel putting significant capital into a publicly traded crypto company sends a powerful signal of legitimacy and confidence to the broader market. Diversified Crypto Strategies: BitMine’s unique position with both Bitcoin mining operations and a large Ethereum treasury highlights the potential for companies to embrace multi-asset crypto strategies. Bridging the Gap: This move further bridges the gap between Silicon Valley’s tech giants and the burgeoning crypto industry, potentially paving the way for more mainstream capital inflows. Focus on Infrastructure: Investing in a mining company underscores the importance of the foundational infrastructure of cryptocurrencies. As the industry matures, the value of the underlying operations that secure and maintain these networks becomes increasingly apparent. While the crypto market remains volatile and subject to regulatory shifts, such strategic investments by influential figures suggest a long-term bullish outlook. It encourages a deeper look into companies that are not just holding crypto but are actively participating in its ecosystem through mining, development, or other value-adding activities. This investment could inspire other traditional investors to re-evaluate their positions on digital assets, potentially leading to a new wave of capital deployment. Peter Thiel’s acquisition of a 9.1% stake in BitMine Immersion Technologies is a landmark event in the cryptocurrency world. It underscores the growing convergence of traditional finance and digital assets, signaling a maturing market where prominent investors are willing to make substantial commitments. BitMine’s dual exposure to Bitcoin mining and a massive Ethereum treasury positions it uniquely, making it an intriguing case study for future institutional crypto strategies. This move by Thiel is not just an investment; it’s a powerful endorsement of the enduring value and potential of the decentralized economy.

2025-07-16T10:48:22,"FED Meeting on July 19 2025: 96.9% Chance of No Interest Rate Hike","The post FED Meeting on July 19 2025: 96.9% Chance of No Interest Rate Hike appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The next Federal Reserve FOMC meeting is scheduled for July 19, 2025, and all eyes are on the central bank’s decision. Veteran trader Matthew Dixon has made a sensational claim on X, stating there’s a 96.9% chance the Fed will keep rates unchanged at 4.25%–4.50%, and zero probability of a rate hike. Dixon also noted a minor 3.1% chance of a 25 bps rate cut, but he emphasized that the Fed’s current stance is firmly on hold. His prediction aligns with broader market sentiment, which suggests the central bank is content to observe further economic data before making any policy shifts. #Fed is Expected to Hold Rates Steady 96.9% probability the Fed will keep the target rate at 4.25%–4.50% 3.1% probability of a rate cut to 4.00%–4.25% 0% probability of a rate hike 1. No Surprise Expected The market is almost fully priced in for a pause, meaning… pic.twitter.com/6zlpIWE3sk — Matthew Dixon – Veteran Financial Trader (@mdtrade) July 16, 2025 June FOMC Meeting Shows Shift in Fed Sentiment Toward Fewer Cuts The previous FOMC meeting on June 18, 2025, ended with the Fed keeping its benchmark rate steady. Interestingly, while the Fed’s dot plot continued to signal two cuts later in the year, an increasing number of officials—seven compared to four previously—favored no further cuts in 2025. This growing hesitation reflects ongoing concern over sticky inflation, even as headline numbers have cooled. The last actual rate cut was on December 18, 2024, when the Fed reduced the rate by 25 basis points. That was the third cut in a series that began in September 2024, when the Fed executed a surprise 50 bps cut, followed by another 25 bps cut in November. Economic Data Suggests No Urgency for Fed Action At the heart of this decision-making is the inflation trend. After starting the year at 3%, US inflation fell steadily to a low of 2.3% in April, before inching back up to 2.7% in June. This suggests that while inflation has moderated, it’s not yet decisively under control. The US unemployment rate has remained relatively stable. From 4% in January, it rose to 4.1% in February and hovered around 4.2% through May, before settling back at 4.1% in June. This level signals a cooling—but not collapsing-job—job market, giving the Fed room to be patient. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : “Jerome Powell’s Firing Is Imminent,” Claims Florida Rep. Anna Paulina Luna , Trump Targets Fed Chair Powell in Battle Over Interest Rates Beyond economic indicators, the Fed faces growing political heat. President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized Chair Jerome Powell, urging aggressive rate cuts down to 1% to stimulate growth and reduce government borrowing costs. Powell, however, has stood firm, stating that the Fed will continue making data-driven decisions, regardless of political pressure. This clash between the executive branch and the central bank has drawn attention globally, especially given the proximity to the 2026 election cycle. Crypto Markets Welcome Rate Stability, Says Matthew Dixon Matthew Dixon believes a pause in rate hikes is mildly bullish for risk-on assets, including crypto. With no surprises expected from the Fed, the market has likely priced in the steady policy stance. Historically, stable or falling interest rates support Bitcoin and altcoins, as lower yields encourage risk-taking. Crypto markets tend to react sharply to unexpected Fed pivots, but in this case, the outlook appears calm, at least for now.As the Fed heads into its July 19 meeting, the message from both the markets and insiders like Dixon is clear: no change is coming. Inflation is manageable, employment is steady, and the Fed appears comfortable staying on pause. While political tensions continue to simmer, Powell’s team seems unlikely to act under pressure. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have once again captured the spotlight, recording a phenomenal $404.85 million in net inflows on July 15. This impressive figure marks the ninth consecutive day of positive flows, a clear indicator of growing investor enthusiasm and a strengthening belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value. This consistent influx of capital underscores a significant shift in how traditional finance is embracing the leading cryptocurrency. What’s Driving the Phenomenal Bitcoin Inflows? The latest data, shared by Trader T on X, paints a vivid picture of robust demand. The $404.85 million net inflow on July 15 is not just a number; it represents a powerful vote of confidence from a diverse range of investors. This continuous stream of Bitcoin inflows suggests a deeper trend of institutional and retail investors seeking regulated and accessible avenues to gain exposure to Bitcoin. Let’s break down the key players contributing to this surge: BlackRock’s IBIT: Leading the charge, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) single-handedly brought in a massive $418.20 million. This demonstrates the immense trust placed in established financial giants and their ability to attract substantial capital. BlackRock’s entry into the Bitcoin ETF space has been a game-changer, providing a familiar and trusted vehicle for institutional investors. VanEck’s HODL: Following closely, VanEck’s Bitcoin Trust (HODL) saw $18.99 million in inflows, indicating broader participation across various ETF providers. Grayscale’s Mini BTC: The newly launched Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) attracted $18.56 million, showcasing interest in new, potentially more fee-efficient offerings from established crypto players. Bitwise’s BITB: Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) added $12.70 million, further diversifying the sources of positive flows. Franklin Templeton’s EZBC: Franklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC) contributed $6.76 million, solidifying the trend of multiple issuers attracting capital. While the overall sentiment was overwhelmingly positive, some ETFs experienced outflows: Grayscale’s GBTC: Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) recorded $41.22 million in net outflows. This is a common pattern as investors migrate from the older, higher-fee GBTC product to newer, lower-fee spot ETFs, including Grayscale’s own Mini BTC. Fidelity’s FBTC: Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) saw $22.93 million in outflows. ARK Invest’s ARKB: ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) had $6.21 million in outflows. Other ETFs reported no daily changes in their holdings, indicating a consolidation of capital into the top-performing and most attractive funds. How Are These Inflows Shaping Crypto Market Trends? The consistent positive flows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs are undeniably influencing broader crypto market trends . This sustained demand provides a strong fundamental backing for Bitcoin’s price, suggesting that a significant portion of the recent price stability and upward momentum is driven by legitimate, long-term investment rather than speculative trading. This institutional interest lends credibility to the asset class, making it more appealing to traditional investors who might have previously been hesitant. Here’s what these trends signify: Increased Liquidity and Stability: As more capital flows into these ETFs, the overall liquidity in the Bitcoin market improves. This can lead to reduced volatility over time, making Bitcoin a more attractive asset for larger, more conservative portfolios. Mainstream Acceptance: The success of these ETFs, particularly those from major financial institutions, signals a growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class within mainstream finance. This paves the way for further integration into traditional investment portfolios. Supply Shock Potential: With substantial amounts of Bitcoin being acquired by these ETFs and effectively taken off the open market, there’s a potential for a supply shock, especially as the Bitcoin halving events continue to reduce new supply. This fundamental pressure could be a significant driver for future price appreciation. Retail Investor Confidence: The institutional stamp of approval through ETFs often trickles down to retail investors, instilling greater confidence and potentially attracting more individual capital into the crypto ecosystem. The Dawn of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption The emergence and success of Spot Bitcoin ETFs represent a watershed moment for institutional Bitcoin adoption . For years, institutions faced significant hurdles in gaining direct exposure to Bitcoin, including regulatory uncertainties, custody challenges, and operational complexities. ETFs effectively remove many of these barriers, offering a regulated, liquid, and familiar investment vehicle. Consider the impact: Accessibility: ETFs allow institutions (pension funds, endowments, wealth managers) to invest in Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency, managing private keys, or dealing with unregulated exchanges. This dramatically expands the pool of potential investors. Regulatory Clarity: The SEC’s approval of these ETFs provides a level of regulatory clarity and legitimacy that was previously lacking, making it easier for compliance-conscious institutions to allocate capital. Diversification: Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed as a valuable diversification tool within traditional portfolios, offering uncorrelated returns and a hedge against inflation in certain economic environments. The ETF structure makes this diversification simpler to achieve. This trend is not just about Bitcoin; it’s about the broader maturation of the digital asset space. As more institutions gain comfortable exposure to Bitcoin, it sets a precedent for other digital assets to follow suit, potentially leading to a wider array of regulated crypto investment products. Navigating Digital Asset Investment: Benefits and Challenges Investing in the burgeoning field of digital asset investment , particularly through Spot Bitcoin ETFs, comes with its own set of unique benefits and challenges. Understanding these aspects is crucial for any investor looking to capitalize on this growing market segment. Benefits: Simplicity and Convenience: ETFs trade on traditional stock exchanges, making them as easy to buy and sell as any stock. This eliminates the complexities of setting up crypto wallets, understanding private keys, or navigating various crypto exchanges. Liquidity: As exchange-traded funds, these products offer high liquidity, allowing investors to enter and exit positions easily throughout the trading day. Professional Management and Custody: Investors benefit from professional management and secure custody solutions provided by the ETF issuers, reducing the risks associated with self-custody or less secure platforms. Portfolio Diversification: For traditional portfolios, Bitcoin can offer diversification benefits due to its relatively low correlation with traditional asset classes like stocks and bonds. Challenges and Considerations: Market Volatility: While ETFs provide a regulated wrapper, the underlying asset, Bitcoin, remains highly volatile. Prices can fluctuate significantly in short periods, posing risks for investors. Fees: ETFs charge management fees (expense ratios) that can eat into returns over time. While generally lower than direct crypto purchases on some platforms, they are an ongoing cost. Regulatory Evolution: The regulatory landscape for digital assets is still evolving. While the approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs is a step forward, future regulatory changes could impact the market. No Direct Ownership: Investing in an ETF means you own shares of a fund that holds Bitcoin, not the Bitcoin itself. This means you don’t have the ability to use Bitcoin for transactions or participate in network activities like staking. The Road Ahead: What’s Next for Spot Bitcoin ETFs? The consistent inflows on July 15 and the preceding eight days suggest that the demand for Spot Bitcoin ETFs is not a fleeting trend but a fundamental shift. As these products gain more traction, we can anticipate several developments: Increased Competition: The success of current ETFs will likely spur more competition, potentially leading to lower fees and more innovative product offerings. Broader Advisor Adoption: Financial advisors, who often prefer regulated products, are increasingly comfortable recommending these ETFs to their clients, further widening the investor base. Potential for Other Crypto ETFs: The success of Bitcoin ETFs could pave the way for similar products for other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, once regulatory clarity is established for those assets. Impact on Bitcoin Price: Continued inflows could exert upward pressure on Bitcoin’s price, especially if the supply from mining continues to diminish relative to demand. The journey of Bitcoin from a niche digital curiosity to a mainstream investment asset has been remarkable. The strong performance of Spot Bitcoin ETFs is a testament to this evolution, signaling a new era of accessibility and acceptance for digital assets in the global financial landscape. In conclusion, the sustained positive net inflows into U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, highlighted by the impressive $404.85 million on July 15, underscore a powerful narrative: institutional and retail investors are increasingly confident in Bitcoin’s future. This trend is not just about capital allocation; it’s about the profound legitimization of Bitcoin within traditional finance, shaping new crypto market trends, and accelerating institutional Bitcoin adoption. While the path of digital asset investment still presents challenges, the momentum generated by these ETFs suggests a robust and promising future for Bitcoin as a cornerstone of modern investment portfolios.

2025-07-16T10:19:51,"Bonk (BONK), Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), and Snek (SNEK) Dominate Memecoin Surge: Price Analysis","The memecoins have started to put on their usual surges as Bitcoin traveled to its new all-time high. The most popular of these currently among traders are $BONK, $PENGU, and $SNEK. How are they performing? $BONK now 4th biggest memecoin Source: TradingView $BONK , the number one memecoin for the Solana network, has now moved into 4th place for the memecoins as a category, with just Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe ahead of it. As can be seen in the short-term chart above, $BONK is really motoring. It is up around 10% for the day so far and is up 132% since breaking out of a downtrend towards the end of June. $BONK has just reached a resistance level now, and if it breaks through here, the targets are $0.000040, and $0.0000486. $PENGU star of the show Source: TradingView Pudgy Penguins ( PENGU ) has been a star of the memecoin show since it broke out of its downtrend at the end of June. Since that time, a 250% price spike to the upside has resulted. Going by Fibonacci extension levels, the 0.786 is the next target at $0.037, while the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level is at $0.073. $SNEK surges out of downtrend Source: TradingView $SNEK has recently broken out of a downtrend that goes back to early December 2024, so perhaps the surge out of the breakout will be set to continue. If Bitcoin continues to do its thing, memecoins like $SNEK might be expected to thrive. Horizontal resistance levels in the chart are possible targets for $SNEK going forward. Word of caution We are potentially entering the final stage of this bull market. The normal 4-year cycle would normally draw to a close later in Q4. That said, this could be an extended bull market, and it could carry on into Q1 and even Q2 of 2026. However, nothing is certain, and when trading memecoins it’s probably best to enter at decent pullbacks, with stop losses underneath, and to take profits regularly. Buying and holding memecoins is not for the faint of heart. It might look as if the market is just going to keep going up, but when it turns and you are stuck in a position, heavy losses can result.

Whales Buy Big, Altcoin Season Ignites appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum is on fire again. As Bitcoin briefly pulls back from its new highs, ETH is climbing steadily, fueling growing buzz about a coming altcoin season. Analysts like Michaël van de Poppe are doubling down on this trend, highlighting Ethereum’s surge as a sign of broader altcoin momentum in the making. There we go, a new high for $ETH / $BTC . This signals that #Altcoins are the play for the coming period, as those will follow Ethereum in the momentum. The breakout at 0.02425 was crucial. pic.twitter.com/pEk2Pqb5zA — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) July 16, 2025 ETH Gains Momentum Amid BTC Cool-Off Bitcoin recently soared past $120,000 , hitting multiple all-time highs before slipping back below $117,000, its lowest in five days. Meanwhile, Ethereum jumped to $3,128, up 20% on the week and 4% in the last 24 hours, marking its highest level in five months. According to Amberdata’s Greg Magadini, “ETH is gaining traction again” after years of lagging behind BTC. The reversal in momentum is noteworthy mainly because of the fact that while Bitcoin surged nearly 300% over the past two years, Ethereum posted just a 60% gain and is still down 8% year-to-date. But that trend could now be shifting. Another good morning, a great morning in the history of mankind. $ETH and #Altcoins continue to go up. — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) July 16, 2025 Michaël van de Poppe explained that the market appears to be preparing for a classic shift into altcoins. He pointed out that Ethereum’s breakout has historically been one of the first signs that investors are beginning to move capital from Bitcoin into other cryptocurrencies. With Bitcoin’s dominance starting to decline, van de Poppe sees this as a clear indication that an altcoin season could be on the horizon. Crypto analyst Wolf says Ethereum’s long consolidation below $4K isn’t weakness but built-up pressure ready to explode. He compares it to Tesla’s 2019 breakout, warning that once ETH clears $4K, panic-buying will follow. Meanwhile, Ash Crypto pointed out that ETH is just 9.73% away from breaking out of a massive 4-year accumulation triangle. $ETH IS NOW ONLY 9.73% AWAY FROM BREAKING OUT OF THIS MASSIVE 4-YEAR ACCUMULATION TRIANGLE. ONCE IT BREAKS, ETH WILL EXPLODE pic.twitter.com/05vz8d8QPv — Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) July 16, 2025 Institutional Demand Shifts to Ethereum A flood of institutional ETH buys adds weight to this theory. Sharplink Gaming just bought $225M worth of Ethereum , while BitMine pushed its ETH holdings above $500M. Simultaneously, Ethereum-based funds have seen 19.5% AUM growth over 12 weeks, double that of Bitcoin ETFs in the same period. These moves, along with growing institutional demand, are boosting sentiment. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Top Altcoins to URGENTLY Accumulate on the Dip , Ethereum-based investment products are also seeing significant inflows. CoinShares’ James Butterfill reported a 19.5% rise in ETH fund assets under management over the last 12 weeks, outpacing Bitcoin funds, which grew 9.8%. “People are preferring Ethereum over Bitcoin,” Butterfill noted. Notably, open interest in ETH futures just hit a 12-month high, further suggesting that whales are gearing up. Altcoin Season Around the Corner? Van de Poppe isn’t the only one pointing to Ethereum as the “kickstarter” of altcoin cycles. With Solana, Chainlink, and other majors also showing signs of bottoming and rotating upward, many traders now expect a wave of capital to flow into altcoins over the next few weeks. If Ethereum continues to hold above $3,100, the stage could be set for a full-blown altcoin breakout, with ETH leading the charge and Bitcoin quietly making room. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The “altcoin season” theory suggests capital rotates from Bitcoin to other cryptocurrencies. Analysts like Michaël van de Poppe believe Ethereum’s breakout is a key indicator, as BTC dominance starts to decline, signaling this shift. How might Ethereum’s continued strength impact the broader crypto market? If Ethereum maintains its position above $3,100 and continues its upward trend, it is expected to lead a full-blown altcoin breakout. This would likely cause a wave of capital to flow into other altcoins like Solana and Chainlink. Is Ethereum a good investment? As the altcoin season begins, the short-term gains make Ethereum a lucrative buying option. However, the long-term promises of this programmable blockchain make it a viable long-term crypto investment.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/why-is-ethereum-price-up-today-whales-buy-big-altcoin-season-ignites/,"ETH|ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis|Ethereum",cryptocompare

While there is an ecosystem of unease around Bitcoin, it is also the right time to find the best crypto to buy now, as volatile times cause some of the best investment opportunities to emerge. Bitcoin Price Stalled Below $120K As soon as Bitcoin moved past the $120K level to hit $123K, the community was elated. However, as expected, a correction followed soon after and short-term bearish signals started to flare up. Thankfully, the red candle was long enough for a panic rally to set in, and after a daily correction of 6%, the BTC price bounced. Hourly charts show that Bitcoin’s immediate resistance is around $118.4K, which could hopefully be crossed by the end of the day. After that, the apex crypto would have to go to $120K to retest its all-time high. Why is Bitcoin Trading Sideways? Bitcoin’s correction after reaching its all-time high was only natural. However, there are core reasons why the current accumulation trend is noteworthy. Profit-Taking and Caution One obvious reason is profit-taking. Long-time holders who waited for BTC to reach its all-time high have pulled back a bit to make gains. ETFs by Fidelity, Grayscale, and Ark & 21Shares have also recorded outflows. Also, whenever Bitcoin has peaked, market conditions have turned volatile, which has made investors cautious. This can be seen from the low trading volumes as of late, indicative of bulls and bears being evenly matched. Pause Before the Next Surge Most of the big names within the cryptocurrency space have been very bullish about Bitcoin. Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of BitMEX, has said that Bitcoin reaching $1 million between now and 2028 is “ inevitable .” Robert Kiyosaki, Cathie Wood, and Binance founder CZ have also echoed these sentiments. However, Bitcoin reaching that level hinges on geopolitical conditions and the changing financial ecosystem. That’s why shrewd investors are biding their time, holding their assets (or trading them sparingly) in order to wait for BTC to finally reach $1 million. Waiting for the Output of Crypto Week Crypto Week is one of the biggest events that could set the regulatory tone of decentralized finance moving forward. While several of the core bills were blocked ahead of the week, Trump claims that they are now moving forward. Whether or not these words hold true is making people cautious, leading to Bitcoin trading sideways. ETFs Have Plateaued for the Time Being While the institutional inflow had a massive surge after Bitcoin ETFs were approved, now that these exchange-traded funds have become mainstream, interest in them has stagnated. While BlackRock’s IBIT has seen consistent inflows , FBTC has seen outflows over the last two days. Is Bitcoin Still the Best Crypto to Buy Now? When we consider the sheer level of market interest, Bitcoin stands out as one of the best cryptocurrency investments for long-term holders. 2025 has seen massive institutional push and new highs for BTC. And since the new US administration is moving ahead with creating crypto-specific regulations where investors could get a bit more leeway, the apex crypto looks to be a good cryptocurrency investment. However, it is a high-cap asset, which means it is out of reach for many retail investors. And since going mainstream, chances are high that it could chart in the same way as a traditional asset. In simple words, it may not provide parabolic gains like it did before. Therefore, investors should consider altcoins that could be directly impacted by Bitcoin’s growth. Here are a few options that investors can look into. Bitcoin Hyper It is common knowledge that meme coins are the first to see a massive surge in price whenever Bitcoin hits a new high. However, Bitcoin Hyper is a project that not only tries to capitalize on Bitcoin’s core narratives but also aims to create a Bitcoin network that has more use cases. Developed on the Ethereum blockchain and integrated with the Solana Virtual Machine, Bitcoin Hyper aims to make the Bitcoin network capable of handling smart contracts and become faster and more efficient. An L2 scaling solution provided by the Lightning Network is being used to enhance Bitcoin's capabilities. Furthermore, the project is also using a Canonical Bridge to provide seamless interoperability between the two chains. In time, the developers hope that more decentralized applications could be built on the Bitcoin network so that it would no longer be limited to just being another “store of value” asset. Recent updates reveal that Bitcoin Hyper has already made the Devnet live, which further indicates that the project does want to follow a utility-focused path. Experts at 99Bitcoins have called Bitcoin Hyper the next 10x BTC layer 2. Snorter Bitcoin’s consolidation has had little impact on the Solana price, which is now following an uptrend, with the community hoping that it could cross the $200 mark soon. One of the reasons why Solana has been such a success is due to Solana-based meme coins. Most of them have proven to be wildly successful, and Snorter has emerged as a trading bot that could help investors find the best one among them. Developed for Telegram, Snorter is a trading bot equipped with automated sniping features to find the best Solana-based investments. It also features security tools such as honeypot and rugpull protection, as well as social trading features like copytrading. Being active on Telegram means it could have a large following that could directly influence the Snorter token’s price in the short and long term. Snorter is also a meme coin, highlighted by its main animal: an aardvark. With a unique animal as a meme, Snorter also has viral potential. Experts like Crypto ZIP have said that Snorter could be a strong 10x presale due to its mix of use cases and memes. Token6900 According to Token6900 , the key to success when investing in memes is not going through too much research or tracking corporate earnings, but letting go of fundamentals altogether. The project completely embraces its lack of utility and creates an ambiance similar to SPX6900, down to aesthetics, and aims to provide users with a “not-so-unique” but honest meme coin that could offer massive short-term gains. The official website has a look of Windows 95, and the social media posts are full of AI-driven memes, most of them making no sense and focusing on the new “AI slop” genre. It means users will find random interviews, artworks that look as if built by someone influenced by chemicals, and an aesthetic that pays homage to the sheer ridiculousness of meme coins. Its tokenomics is simple but involves key aspects like vesting, giving the cryptocurrency community complete power. Staking rewards are also part of its appeal, and there is one hidden task to which exactly 24.9993% of the total supply has been allocated. Despite pursuing no utility, Token6900 has raised upwards of $500K within days of being launched on presale. Conclusion Although Bitcoin has started to trade sideways, there is no cause to worry. Correction and consolidation after a growth cycle are common. However, due to ongoing regulatory conversations and geopolitical conditions that often involve liberal talks about tariffs and war, the current trends feel more important than they actually are. Investors are advised to exercise patience. And if they are looking for the best crypto to buy now, they should focus on assets currently only available on presale. These assets could provide gains without subjecting investors to the current market’s volatility and have themes that could create strong communities.

2025-07-16T10:01:56,"From $0.03 to $1.00? This altcoin hints at a potential 30x by late 2026","Analysts watching Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s roadmap closely are beginning to eye a possible 30x run, targeting the $1 mark by late 2026, and it’s not just hype. What separates Mutuum Finance (MUTM) from typical presale tokens is the level of structure behind it. Every phase of its development roadmap is strategically aligned with real product delivery, user utility, and long-term ecosystem value. While retail investors chase short-term pumps, more serious players are studying how each of these roadmap milestones could unlock exponential upside over time. Roadmap-driven growth with built-in utility Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Finance is building a dual-model lending protocol—a decentralized, non-custodial platform offering both Pool-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) loan systems. This isn’t theoretical; it’s already been laid out in a clear 4-phase roadmap. So far, the core elements of Phase 1 have already been executed, ranging from the presale launch and tracking site listings to internal support infrastructure and external contract audits. Phase 2 will bring the foundation of the system online with smart contract engineering, front-end/back-end architecture, and infrastructure rollout. Phase 3 marks the beginning of public beta testing, bug reporting systems, and the demo launch, followed closely by Phase 4, which includes the exchange listing, token claiming, and activation of the bug bounty. Beyond the beta, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will expand rapidly. Later phases will introduce Layer-2 scaling, boosting the protocol’s performance with cheaper and faster transaction throughput. Just as important is the planned release of a decentralized stablecoin, minted only when users borrow against overcollateralized assets like ETH or LINK. These stablecoins will be burned upon loan repayment or liquidation, making the supply tightly regulated by protocol governance. This is a real treasury utility—not an empty promise. Unlike volatile “DeFi experiments,” Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building trust through transparency. Its smart contracts received a Token Scan Score of 95.00 from CertiK, and the platform now features a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program to secure the ecosystem ahead of its public rollout. That level of preparation is already turning heads in the altcoin research communities. Staking, stablecoins, and a revenue-backed passive model At the heart of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s income-generating machine is the mtToken system. When users deposit blue-chip assets into the P2C lending pools, they receive 1:1 mtTokens—ERC-20 assets that accrue value as borrowers pay interest. These mtTokens are not only liquid, but in future platform phases, they will also be staked into designated smart contracts, allowing users to receive MUTM token dividends sourced from actual platform revenue. One early investor made a simple portfolio move—splitting her $6,000 evenly between Bitcoin (BTC) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) during Phase 2, when the token price was just $0.015. While his BTC allocation is up 20% to $3,600, her MUTM holdings have already doubled, growing from $3,000 to $6,000 as the project advanced into Phase 5 at $0.03. The investor now holds 200,000 MUTM tokens, positioning her for significant upside. With a capped supply and expanding on-chain utility, his holdings are projected to surge dramatically when MUTM reaches its $1 target by 2026, turning her initial $3,000 into $200,000—a remarkable 66× gain that dwarfs typical returns in legacy markets and meme coins alike. For early believers, this example shows the power of disciplined allocation and early entry into a protocol designed around sustainable DeFi utility. Only one tier before the final surge With Phase 5 nearly closed and the price at just $0.03, investors are watching closely. The next price tier—$0.035 in Phase 6—marks a 20% increase and is the last chance to enter before the late-stage rush. Once the platform goes live, users will not just be speculating on charts—they’ll be earning, staking, borrowing, and building yield across the full lending suite. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now far more than a low-cap coin. It’s a token backed by utility, governed by code, and supported by a transparent roadmap that stretches through 2026. There’s still time to get in—but it won’t be long before the $0.03 window is gone for good.

2025-07-16T10:00:21,"Bitmax Bitcoin: Korea’s Bold Leap into Corporate Crypto Dominance","BitcoinWorld Bitmax Bitcoin: Korea’s Bold Leap into Corporate Crypto Dominance In a significant move poised to reshape the landscape of institutional crypto adoption in South Korea, Bitmax, a publicly listed Korean company, has announced a substantial increase in its Bitmax Bitcoin holdings. This strategic accumulation underscores a growing trend among corporations globally to embrace digital assets as a core component of their treasury management. With an additional purchase of 51.06 BTC, Bitmax’s total Bitcoin reserves now stand at an impressive 400.25 BTC, solidifying its position as the leading publicly listed company in South Korea by Bitcoin holdings. This bold step has drawn immediate comparisons to MicroStrategy, the U.S. software firm that pioneered large-scale corporate Bitcoin accumulation, signaling Bitmax’s ambition to become the “Korean MicroStrategy.” What does this mean for the future of corporate investment in the crypto space, particularly in a tech-forward nation like South Korea? Why is Bitmax Bitcoin Accumulating So Much? Bitmax’s journey into the crypto world is itself a testament to the transformative power of digital assets. Originally focused on augmented reality (AR) technology, the company made a pivotal strategic shift towards crypto investment, recognizing the immense potential of the burgeoning digital economy. This pivot wasn’t arbitrary; it reflects a calculated decision to capitalize on Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition and its role as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. The latest acquisition of 51.06 BTC is not just an isolated event but part of a continuous accumulation strategy that has seen the company steadily build its reserves. The rationale behind Bitmax Bitcoin ’s aggressive accumulation strategy appears multi-faceted: Strategic Diversification: Moving beyond traditional assets, Bitcoin offers a new avenue for treasury diversification, potentially enhancing overall portfolio resilience. Long-Term Value Appreciation: Bitcoin’s historical performance and its capped supply make it an attractive asset for companies looking to preserve and grow capital over the long term. Market Leadership: By becoming the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin in South Korea, Bitmax aims to establish itself as a pioneer and thought leader in the domestic crypto investment landscape. Mirroring Success: The explicit comparison to MicroStrategy suggests a belief that following a similar accumulation model can yield significant returns and enhance shareholder value, especially in a market with increasing institutional interest. This strategic shift highlights a broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies within the corporate sector, moving from speculative assets to legitimate components of a company’s balance sheet. Korean Corporate Bitcoin: A Growing Trend? Bitmax’s substantial Korean Corporate Bitcoin holdings place it at the forefront of a potentially emerging trend within South Korea’s corporate landscape. While global giants like Tesla and Block (formerly Square) have made headlines with their Bitcoin acquisitions, the adoption by publicly listed companies in South Korea has been more cautious, largely due to a stringent regulatory environment and cultural factors. Bitmax’s move could serve as a catalyst, encouraging other Korean firms to explore similar strategies. The implications of such a trend are significant: Increased Legitimacy: Corporate adoption lends significant credibility to Bitcoin and the broader crypto market, helping to dispel lingering doubts about its volatility and utility. Enhanced Liquidity: As more corporations hold Bitcoin, the overall market liquidity could improve, making it easier for large transactions to occur without significant price impact. Regulatory Scrutiny: A surge in Korean Corporate Bitcoin holdings would likely draw increased attention from financial regulators, potentially leading to clearer guidelines and frameworks for digital asset management. Investor Confidence: When established companies allocate significant capital to Bitcoin, it can boost confidence among retail and institutional investors alike, signaling a robust long-term outlook for the asset. The question now is whether Bitmax’s pioneering step will pave the way for a broader embrace of Bitcoin by other South Korean conglomerates and tech firms, transforming the nation into a hub for corporate crypto treasury management. The MicroStrategy Comparison: Is Bitmax Following the Blueprint? The explicit positioning of Bitmax as the “Korean counterpart to Strategy” (presumably referring to MicroStrategy) invites a detailed comparison. MicroStrategy, under the leadership of Michael Saylor, embarked on an aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy starting in 2020, accumulating over 200,000 BTC. This strategy transformed the software company into a de facto Bitcoin holding entity, significantly impacting its stock performance and market perception. So, how does Bitmax’s approach stack up against the MicroStrategy Comparison ? Feature MicroStrategy (MSTR) Bitmax (Korea) Primary Business Enterprise Software Augmented Reality (Pivoted to Crypto) Initial Holdings Began with zero, accumulated rapidly Pivoted from AR, steadily accumulating Total BTC Holdings 200,000+ BTC (as of early 2024) 400.25 BTC Funding Strategy Utilized corporate cash, convertible notes, debt offerings, equity sales Likely corporate cash, potentially exploring similar financing avenues Public Stance Very vocal, evangelistic about Bitcoin Announcing via X, positioning as Korean leader Market Impact Pioneered corporate BTC treasury strategy, inspired others First mover in Korea among listed firms, potential trendsetter While Bitmax’s holdings are currently modest compared to MicroStrategy’s vast reserves, the strategic intent appears remarkably similar: to leverage Bitcoin as a primary treasury asset. The challenges, however, also mirror those faced by MicroStrategy, including: Volatility Risk: Bitcoin’s price fluctuations can significantly impact a company’s balance sheet and stock performance. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving regulatory landscape in South Korea could pose challenges for large-scale crypto holdings. Shareholder Perception: Investors may view a significant pivot to crypto as either visionary or excessively risky. The success of Bitmax’s strategy will largely depend on its ability to navigate these challenges while effectively communicating its long-term vision to shareholders and the market. Institutional Crypto Adoption: What Does This Mean for the Market? Bitmax’s latest acquisition is more than just a company-specific event; it’s a barometer for the accelerating trend of Institutional Crypto Adoption globally. When publicly traded companies, especially those outside the traditional finance sector, commit significant capital to Bitcoin, it sends a powerful signal to the broader market. This growing institutional interest is crucial for the maturation of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Here’s why: Mainstream Acceptance: Corporate treasury adoption helps to normalize Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, moving it beyond the realm of niche investment. Increased Capital Inflow: Institutional investments bring substantial capital into the market, potentially providing price stability and long-term upward pressure. Product Development: Growing demand from institutions often spurs the development of sophisticated financial products and services, such as Bitcoin ETFs, custodial solutions, and derivatives, further integrating crypto into the traditional financial system. Reduced Volatility (Long-Term): While initial large buys can cause price spikes, a broad base of institutional holders who are in for the long term can help reduce overall market volatility over time, as fewer coins are available for short-term trading. Bitmax’s actions contribute to a global narrative where Bitcoin is increasingly viewed not just as a speculative asset but as a strategic reserve asset, akin to gold or other commodities. This shift is fundamental to Bitcoin’s journey towards becoming a globally recognized store of value and medium of exchange. Understanding the BTC Investment Landscape in Korea South Korea has a unique and often complex relationship with cryptocurrencies. It boasts one of the most active retail trading markets globally, yet its regulatory stance has historically been cautious, focusing on investor protection and anti-money laundering (AML) measures. This backdrop is crucial for understanding Bitmax’s bold BTC Investment strategy. Key aspects of the Korean crypto landscape include: Strict Regulations: The Financial Services Commission (FSC) and other regulatory bodies have implemented stringent rules for virtual asset service providers (VASPs), including licensing requirements and AML obligations. High Retail Adoption: Despite regulations, crypto trading is immensely popular among South Koreans, with a significant portion of the population participating in the market. Innovation Hub: South Korea is a leader in blockchain technology and innovation, with many startups exploring decentralized applications and Web3 initiatives. Government Stance: While there’s a push for innovation, the government also maintains a firm stance on preventing illicit activities and protecting consumers, which can sometimes lead to perceived hurdles for institutional adoption. For Bitmax, navigating this environment means not only managing the inherent risks of Bitcoin price volatility but also ensuring full compliance with Korean financial regulations. The company’s ability to successfully integrate a significant BTC Investment into its balance sheet, while adhering to local laws, could set a precedent for other Korean entities. This move could also signal a growing confidence among Korean businesses that the regulatory framework, while strict, is becoming more predictable, allowing for strategic long-term digital asset holdings. Bitmax’s strategic decision to significantly expand its Bitcoin holdings to 400.25 BTC marks a pivotal moment for corporate crypto adoption in South Korea. By positioning itself as the “Korean MicroStrategy,” the company is not only making a substantial investment in the future of digital finance but also challenging the conventional norms of corporate treasury management within the region. This bold move underscores a growing global trend where forward-thinking companies recognize Bitcoin’s potential as a long-term store of value and a hedge against economic uncertainties. While challenges such as market volatility and regulatory complexities remain, Bitmax’s pioneering step could inspire a wave of similar corporate Bitcoin acquisitions across South Korea, further cementing the legitimacy and integration of cryptocurrencies into the mainstream economy. The world watches to see if Bitmax’s vision will indeed pave the way for a new era of corporate digital asset stewardship in Asia.

2025-07-16T10:00:21,"Cantor Fitzgerald Set to Acquire $3.5B in Bitcoin From Blockstream","Cantor Fitzgerald is reportedly moving to acquire over $3.5 billion worth of Bitcoin from Adam Back’s Blockstream Capital, in a deal that could significantly increase its position in the digital asset space. According to reports from the Financial Times and Bloomberg, Brandon Lutnick, the 27-year-old son of U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, is finalizing the deal through Cantor Fitzgerald, with completion expected as early as this week. Cantor to Receive 30,000 Bitcoin The transaction involves Cantor Equity Partners 1, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) that raised $200 million in January, and Adam Back-founded Blockstream Capital . Under the proposed structure, Blockstream would contribute up to 30,000 Bitcoin, valued at $3.5 billion, in exchange for equity in Cantor’s SPAC, which would be renamed BSTR Holdings following the deal. Additionally, the agreement outlines plans to raise up to $800 million in new capital to facilitate further Bitcoin purchases. If the deal closes as planned, Cantor Fitzgerald would become one of the largest institutional buyers of Bitcoin globally. Combined with Cantor’s other vehicle, Twenty One Capital, the firm’s crypto acquisitions could approach nearly $10 billion by the end of this year. This move comes shortly after Cantor’s $3.6 billion crypto deal with SoftBank and Tether in April to form a dedicated Bitcoin acquisition entity. Brandon Lutnick, who became chair of Cantor Fitzgerald in February after his father’s confirmation as Trump’s trade official, is steering the firm deeper into the Bitcoin market with these acquisitions. Part of a Broader Bitcoin Capital Strategy The strategy reflects a growing trend among institutions looking to maximize Bitcoin per share, taking inspiration from Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which has accumulated approximately $70 billion in Bitcoin since 2020. Twenty One Capital, Cantor’s other crypto-focused entity, is actively following this approach, and Cantor closed its first Bitcoin lending deal in May. These moves underline the firm’s commitment to expanding its presence in the crypto lending and acquisition space amid increased institutional interest in Bitcoin. Adam Back, whose 1997 cryptographic invention Hashcash became foundational to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work mechanism, continues to play a significant role in the Bitcoin ecosystem through Blockstream’s operations and its capital initiatives.

2025-07-16T10:00:14,"Altcoin Season Index Spikes Above 30, But Bitcoin Dominance Remains High, What Next?","The altcoin season has remained elusive because Bitcoin has continued to dominate the market. Even now, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap is still in the lead and continues to determine the direction of the rest of the crypto market. However, there is a turn in the tide coming as more altcoins begin to play catch-up. In particular, the coins in the list of Top 100 altcoins by market cap look to be on the verge of ushering in the next altcoin season. Altcoin Season Index Fires Into The Green The Altcoin Season Index is an index that charts the performance of the Top 100 altcoins by market cap against the performance of Bitcoin to determine when the altcoin season is in full bloom. This index, which goes from 1-100, is ranked by how many top 100 altcoins are outperforming BTC over a 90-day period, and when this figure rises to the 75% mark, it often signals that the altcoin season has begun. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Not Stopping At $123,000 — Technical Indicators Point To $140,000 Top Over the last few months, altcoins have performed quite terribly in comparison to Bitcoin, and this has led to the Altcoin Season Index dropping toward peak lows. The index hit a score of 12 back in June 2025, showing that only 12 altcoins had outperformed Bitcoin over the 90-day timeframe. During this time, the Bitcoin dominance also rose rapidly, reaching as high as 66%, and signaling that most of the attention was on BTC during this time. However, the month of July has come with good tidings for the altcoin market as the index has seen its score more than double from its June lows. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the Altcoin Season Index has now crossed a score of 30. It also shows that during this time, 32 coins have outperformed Bitcoin’s 40% increase in the last three months. Interestingly, the meme coins are once again leading the rally with the likes of PENGU and MemeCore rallying over 500% in the 90-day period. HyperLiquid’s HYPE has also performed quite well, with CoinMarketCap data showing it has risen more than 230% in 90 days. Bitcoin Dominance On The Verge Of Collapse? So far, the Bitcoin dominance has maintained its position in the 60th percentile, and this has remained so for the last 90 days. However, over the last two weeks, there has been enough decline in the dominance to spark a ray of hope among investors, and that is a 3% drop toward 63%. Related Reading: Prepare For ATHs: ‘XRP Train Has Left The Station – Analyst Going by historical performance, though, the Bitcoin dominance would need to drop much more than this for altcoin season to begin in full bloom. For example, back in 2017, the Bitcoin dominance crashed from above 95% to around 50% before the altcoin season began. Again, in 2017, the dominance fell from above 70% to around 41% before the altcoin season began. Going by this trend, the Bitcoin dominance would need to see a drop back into the 40% region, and possibly the 30% region, for the altcoin season to really take hold. But as long as the dominance remains high, then Bitcoin would continue to lead the market, and altcoins could continue to struggle.

2025-07-16T09:53:12,"Trump steps in to save Crypto Bills from GOP rebels","US President Donald Trump delivered a last-minute save for the crypto industry last night. He reportedly brokered a deal with conservative House Republicans to revive long-awaited crypto bills that had faced a surprise setback recently. The dramatic U-turn followed a failed procedural vote in the House earlier in the day, when 13 hard-line GOP members joined Democrats to block debate on the crypto-friendly legislation. This move sparked panic in markets and tanked crypto-linked stocks. Bitcoin price saw a straight dip to $116k levels from trading over $120K amid the fallout. Trump jumps in to revive crypto bills In a late-night post on Truth Social, Trump revealed he met with the dissenting Republicans in the Oval Office. After a “short discussion,” he said, the lawmakers agreed to flip their votes in favor of the rule required to move the bills to the floor for a full vote. “They have all agreed to vote tomorrow morning in favor of the Rule,” Trump wrote in a post. He added that House Speaker Mike Johnson had joined the meeting remotely and supports fast-tracking the vote. However, he even thanked Congress for its quick and positive response. The House will now consider three major industry-backed crypto bills this week. It is being seen as a moment that could reshape US digital asset regulation. Source: Donald Trump’s Truth Social . According to reports, the procedural vote was derailed when conservatives rebelled over the stablecoin legislation’s structure. Lawmakers, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Tim Burchett objected to House leaders’ decision to take up a Senate-passed version of the bill without allowing amendments. Two of the most vocal rebels, Reps. Anna Paulina Luna and Eli Crane were demanding an amendment that would ban the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency ( CBDC ). This has been seen as a growing concern among crypto advocates. The failed rule vote ended in a 196–223 tally while catching the market off guard. Bitcoin bounces back after Trump’s move The digital asset market printed red indexes all around yesterday. Bitcoin fell by over 5% dipping below $117K, while stocks like Coinbase, Robinhood, and Riot Platforms all slipped in extended trading. The fear and greed index is still flashing “Greed” among the traders. The cumulative crypto market saw a recovery of almost 3% on Wednesday morning. BTC is trading at an average price of $118,727 at press time. The biggest altcoin, Ethereum, surged by over 6% in the last 24 hours, outperforming BTC’s surge. ETH price is now up by 22% in the past 7 days. The altcoin is trading at an average price of $3,170 at press time. The fear and greed index is still flashing “Greed” among the traders. Trump’s recent intervention somehow shows his promise to be a “crypto president.” Now, House leaders are expected to hold a re-vote on the rule opening the door for full debate and passage of the three bills. This includes a bipartisan stablecoin regulation framework, a market structure bill clarifying the role of the SEC and CFTC and protections for self-custody and decentralized finance.

2025-07-16T09:52:22,"Bitcoin 2025 Forecast: Analysts Compare Bitcoin Solaris’ Dual-Consensus Technology to Early Bitcoin Investment","The post Bitcoin 2025 Forecast: Analysts Compare Bitcoin Solaris’ Dual-Consensus Technology to Early Bitcoin Investment appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News With Bitcoin pushing through new forecasts for 2025, investors are starting to ask a familiar question: What’s the next big opportunity? Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is emerging as one of the hottest answers. Its revolutionary approach to mobile mining and blockchain scalability is now drawing comparisons to Bitcoin’s earliest days, especially as analysts dissect the power behind its hybrid dual-consensus architecture. Why Bitcoin Solaris is Being Compared to Early Bitcoin Bitcoin Solaris is not just another speculative crypto. The platform merges the best of Bitcoin’s proven PoW security with the scalability of Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) through a layered architecture. At its foundation, the Base Layer utilizes SHA-256 mining, aligning with traditional Bitcoin miners while offering greater efficiency with 5-minute block times and regular difficulty adjustments. Above this, the Solaris Layer brings high-speed DPoS validation with 15-second blocks and validator rotation to maintain network integrity. This blend ensures BTC-S delivers over 10,000 TPS performance through its dual-consensus approach, putting it in a completely different league from Bitcoin’s limited scalability. The New Frontier: Mobile Mining Bitcoin Solaris is redefining what mining looks like in the modern era. Through the upcoming Solaris Nova App, users can mine directly from their smartphones, laptops, or desktops without needing expensive hardware or deep technical knowledge. While Bitcoin miners still require rigs north of $10,000 to stay competitive, BTC-S breaks those barriers with mobile-first mining solutions designed for the everyday user. The Blockchain Built to Break Limits Say Hello to BTC-S For more technical users, the Solaris Nova App also connects with ASICs and GPUs, automatically optimizing mining operations based on device capabilities. Energy efficiency is central here, with BTC-S reducing consumption by 99.95% compared to traditional Bitcoin mining. Mining Made Easy with Bitcoin Solaris One-click mining via mobile or desktop Dynamic device optimization ensures efficiency Access to decentralized mining power marketplaces Built-in wallet and security features, including biometric login BTC-S mining is not just about access, it is about democratizing blockchain wealth creation in a way Bitcoin never could. Presale Momentum: Why Investors Are Piling In Bitcoin Solaris’ presale is racing toward its $20 launch price with over $7M already raised and more than 14,200 users on board. Currently priced at $12, the next phase moves to $13, with only around 2 weeks left before the presale closes on July 31, 2025. Many call this the shortest, most explosive presale in the market right now. Trust Wallet and Metamask are recommended for seamless token delivery post-launch. Bitcoin Solaris has also passed audits from Cyberscope and Freshcoins, adding more confidence for participants eager to lock in before the next price hike. The influencer space is catching on too. A detailed review by Crypto Show highlights why Bitcoin Solaris is not just another presale; it’s a revolution in crypto mining accessibility and blockchain scalability. Behind the Tech: Dual-Consensus Explained The backbone of Bitcoin Solaris’ strength is its hybrid consensus. Base Layer (PoW): SHA-256 mining, 5-minute blocks, robust security against 51% attacks. Solaris Layer (DPoS): 21 validators, 15-second blocks, dynamic sizes up to 32MB, validator rotation every 24 hours. Cross-Layer Sync: Ensures both layers operate in harmony with state commitments on the Base Layer. This structure allows Bitcoin Solaris to achieve up to 100,000 TPS on its Solaris Layer while maintaining a secure, immutable foundation. Expanding Horizons with Tokenomics Bitcoin Solaris supports a long-term ecosystem through a fair and transparent token distribution. With a fixed supply of 21 million BTC-S tokens, its model reflects Bitcoin’s scarcity while optimizing for modern DeFi and blockchain needs. Token Allocation: 66.66% for mining 20% presale 5% liquidity pools 2% ecosystem development 2% community rewards 2% staking rewards 2% marketing 0.33% team and advisors The full breakdown can be reviewed through Bitcoin Solaris Tokenomics . Final Verdict Bitcoin Solaris is shaping up to be more than a presale sensation. It is a serious contender for those who missed the early Bitcoin wave and are now looking for something with comparable long-term upside but modernized for today’s market needs. From mobile mining to its hybrid blockchain architecture, BTC-S delivers scalability, accessibility, and innovation in one package.

2025-07-16T09:52:20,"Top Altcoins to URGENTLY Accumulate on the Dip","The post Top Altcoins to URGENTLY Accumulate on the Dip appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin surged past a new all-time hig h of $123,000 , but the rally didn’t last long. The price quickly dropped below $118,000 as major investors took profits. This led to a market-wide correction of about 5% to 10% across many cryptocurrencies. Amid the dip, popular crypto analyst Crypto Banter has urged investors to treat the current market dip as a rare chance to urgently accumulate top altcoins before the next major rally. Top Altcoins to Buy The Dip As Bitcoin’s dominance begins to wane and capital rotates into altcoins, several key tokens are flashing strong “buy” signals, supported by both technical trends and recent fundamental developments. Among his top picks, Solana (SOL) stands out. It’s currently trading around $166.7, but according to Banter, any dip below $160 creates a great opportunity to buy before a possible move to $187 or even $240. Next is Cardano (ADA). Banter suggests the best buying zone is between $0.69 and $0.71, especially after the price bounced off key support levels. Ripple’s XRP also made the list. With strong support around $2.60 and $2.80, Banter believes XRP is “gearing up” to break its all-time high and possibly reach $6. For Algorand (ALGO), he recommends buying between $2.55 and $2.70, a range that lines up with past resistance levels. Banter puts extra focus on SUI, saying there’s urgency to buy near $3.70 to $3.84. Right now, SUI is trading around $4, showing a 3.65% gain already. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Week Recap: Bitcoin Surges as U.S. Debates Digital Asset Bills , Other Tokens to Keep An Eye on Other altcoins to keep an eye on include Dogecoin (DOGE), trading at $0.17, which could benefit from ETF rumors and growing meme coin interest. NEAR Protocol (NEAR), currently at $2.5, is also showing strong potential for the next rally. Crypto Banter believes that as Bitcoin’s drop slows down and altcoins get stronger, a big rally could be coming. They think altcoins are about to enter a powerful growth phase, helped by good news from governments and more money coming in through ETFs. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-16T09:50:40,"Altcoin Season: Unveiling Bitcoin’s Dominant Grip on the Crypto Market","BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season: Unveiling Bitcoin’s Dominant Grip on the Crypto Market Are you wondering why your favorite altcoins aren’t soaring while Bitcoin seems to be holding its ground? The latest data from CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index offers a compelling answer. Registering at a score of 38 on July 16, 00:30 UTC, this key metric signals a clear shift: the crypto market is currently deep in what’s known as Bitcoin Season . This score, a seven-point increase from the previous day’s figure reported by Bitcoin World, provides crucial insight into the prevailing sentiment and capital flows within the digital asset space. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index and Bitcoin Season Dynamics To truly grasp the implications of an Altcoin Season Index score of 38, it’s essential to understand what this metric represents and how it’s calculated. The Altcoin Season Index, a proprietary tool by CoinMarketCap (CMC), serves as a barometer for the broader cryptocurrency performance across the market. It offers a snapshot of whether altcoins as a collective are outperforming Bitcoin, or vice-versa. Here’s how the index works: Scope: The index rigorously tracks the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization listed on CoinMarketCap. Exclusions: To maintain accuracy and focus on genuine market movements, stablecoins (like USDT, USDC) and wrapped tokens (like WBTC) are deliberately excluded from the calculation. This ensures the index reflects organic growth and decline in volatile assets. Timeframe: The comparison is made over a 90-day period, providing a medium-term view of market trends rather than short-term fluctuations. The Thresholds: The index operates on a scale from 1 to 100. The distinction between Altcoin Season and Bitcoin Season is defined by clear thresholds: Market Phase Altcoin Season Index Score Criteria Altcoin Season 75 or higher At least 75% of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins/wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. Bitcoin Season 25 or lower 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins/wrapped tokens) have managed to outperform Bitcoin over the past 90 days. Neither / Mixed Between 26 and 74 The market is in a transitional or mixed phase, where neither altcoins nor Bitcoin show clear, sustained dominance. With the index currently at 38, it firmly places the market in Bitcoin Season , indicating that Bitcoin is the dominant force, and most altcoins are struggling to keep pace. Why is the Crypto Market Currently in Bitcoin Season? The current state of the crypto market trends , characterized by Bitcoin’s outperformance, is influenced by several intertwined factors. It’s not just a random occurrence; rather, it reflects a combination of macroeconomic conditions, investor sentiment, and specific catalysts within the crypto ecosystem. Macroeconomic Uncertainty: In times of global economic instability or uncertainty, investors often gravitate towards perceived safer assets. Within the crypto space, Bitcoin is widely considered the most established and least volatile asset compared to the vast array of altcoins. This ‘flight to quality’ sees capital flow into BTC, bolstering its price and dominance. Institutional Adoption and ETFs: The increasing interest from institutional investors and the approval of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in various jurisdictions have provided a significant tailwind for Bitcoin. These developments make it easier for large capital to enter the Bitcoin market, driving demand and price appreciation. Altcoins, while gaining traction, generally lack the same level of institutional accessibility and regulatory clarity. The Bitcoin Halving Narrative: Bitcoin’s programmatic supply shock, known as the ‘halving,’ which reduces the rate at which new bitcoins are created, historically precedes significant bull runs. Even in anticipation, this narrative often draws attention and capital specifically to Bitcoin, as investors front-run potential price surges. Liquidity Concentration: During periods of lower overall market liquidity, capital tends to concentrate in the largest and most liquid assets. Bitcoin, with its deep order books and global accessibility, naturally attracts this liquidity, leaving many altcoins struggling for volume and price momentum. Navigating Altcoin Performance During Bitcoin Dominance For investors, understanding that we are in a Bitcoin Season is crucial for managing expectations and strategizing their cryptocurrency portfolio . When Bitcoin dominates, the vast majority of altcoins typically underperform against BTC. This means that even if an altcoin sees a price increase in fiat terms (e.g., USD), it might still be losing value when measured against Bitcoin. What does this mean for your altcoin holdings? General Underperformance: Expect most altcoins to lag behind Bitcoin’s gains. Some might even decline in BTC terms. Selective Opportunities: While the overall trend favors Bitcoin, there can still be selective opportunities in altcoins driven by specific narratives (e.g., AI, RWA, gaming, specific Layer 2 solutions) or strong fundamental developments. However, these are often higher-risk plays and require thorough research. Reduced Liquidity: Many altcoins may experience lower trading volumes, leading to higher volatility and potentially larger price swings, both up and down, on smaller trades. Capital Rotation: Instead of new money flowing broadly into altcoins, any significant altcoin pumps might be due to temporary capital rotation from Bitcoin profits, which often flows back into BTC after a short period. The challenge for investors during such periods is to resist the urge to chase small altcoin pumps and instead focus on risk management and a clear understanding of market cycles. Historical Context: When Does Altcoin Season Emerge? While we are currently in Bitcoin Season , it’s important to remember that the crypto market is cyclical. Altcoin Season is not gone forever; it’s merely waiting for the right conditions to emerge. Historically, Altcoin Seasons have typically followed periods of Bitcoin dominance or consolidation. Key triggers for past Altcoin Seasons (e.g., 2017, 2021) have included: Bitcoin Price Consolidation: After a significant Bitcoin rally, if BTC enters a period of consolidation or sideways trading, capital often starts flowing down the market cap ladder into altcoins. Investors, having made profits on Bitcoin, seek higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities. Ethereum (ETH) Breaking Out: Often, Ethereum, as the second-largest cryptocurrency and the backbone of many DeFi and NFT ecosystems, leads the charge for altcoins. A strong ETH performance can signal the start of broader altcoin rallies. Emergence of New Narratives: Past Altcoin Seasons were fueled by groundbreaking narratives like DeFi (Decentralized Finance), NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), GameFi, and more recently, AI-related tokens. These narratives attract new users and capital, creating significant buzz and demand for related altcoins. Technological Advancements: Major upgrades or successful rollouts of new technologies (e.g., Ethereum’s Merge, Layer 2 scaling solutions gaining traction) can also ignite interest in specific ecosystems and their native tokens. The Altcoin Index will rise again when these conditions align, signifying a shift in market sentiment and capital flow back into the broader altcoin market. Actionable Insights for Your Cryptocurrency Portfolio Given the current crypto market trends and the prevalence of Bitcoin Season, how should you adjust your strategy? Here are some actionable insights to consider for your cryptocurrency portfolio : Prioritize Bitcoin: In a Bitcoin-dominant market, maintaining a significant allocation to BTC can be a prudent strategy. It offers a relatively stable anchor for your portfolio and is likely to capture the majority of market gains. Strategic Altcoin Selection: If you choose to invest in altcoins, be highly selective. Focus on projects with strong fundamentals, clear utility, active development teams, and robust communities. Avoid chasing hype or meme coins unless you have a high-risk tolerance and a clear exit strategy. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, consider using a dollar-cost averaging strategy. This involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the price. This approach helps mitigate risk during volatile periods and allows you to accumulate assets at a better average price over time. Monitor Dominance Charts: Keep an eye on Bitcoin’s dominance chart (BTC.D). A rising dominance indicates Bitcoin Season, while a falling dominance often precedes or accompanies Altcoin Season. Risk Management is Key: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Set stop-loss orders for trades, and understand that altcoins, especially smaller ones, carry higher risks. Patience and Long-Term View: Market cycles take time to play out. A patient, long-term perspective can help you weather periods of Bitcoin dominance and position yourself for the eventual return of Altcoin Season. The Altcoin Season Index at 38 serves as a clear indicator of the current market climate: Bitcoin is in the driver’s seat. While this means many altcoins will struggle to outperform, it also presents an opportunity for strategic positioning. Understanding the dynamics of the Altcoin Index and Bitcoin Season allows investors to make informed decisions, manage risk effectively, and prepare for the inevitable shifts in crypto market trends . The crypto world is constantly evolving, and staying informed about these key metrics is paramount for navigating its complexities and optimizing your cryptocurrency performance .

2025-07-16T09:47:09,"Analyst Reveals What to Expect Next for Bitcoin! ""Is a Harder Correction Coming?""","Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a historic day on Monday, breaking records for the first time in a row, surpassing $123,000. However, the joy of a new ATH was short-lived. Shortly after surpassing $123,000, BTC began to decline, falling to the $116,000 level. While the market agrees that this correction is due to profit taking and is normal, they are divided on which direction the price will move next. At this point, 21 Shares analyst Matt Mena evaluated the rise in Bitcoin and the subsequent decline. Matt Mena said that a sharp decline in Bitcoin is unlikely as institutional demand strengthens. Mena stated that Bitcoin is unlikely to experience a prolonged sharp decline due to increasing demand and shrinking supply. Stating that Bitcoin supply is at a record low level, and spot BTC ETFs have received several times the amount of BTC expected to be issued this year, the analyst said: “The Bitcoin chart shows a structural imbalance between rising demand and a rapidly declining supply base. While the amount of Bitcoin held on exchanges and over-the-counter platforms is at historic lows, demand continues to grow. US Bitcoin ETFs have absorbed several times the amount of Bitcoin that will be mined this year in just the first half of the year. “I would say that a long-term correction in Bitcoin is impossible, as there are far more positive factors than negative factors in the end.” However, Mena warned that while the outlook is positive, US President Donald Trump’s potential tariff policies and delays in Fed interest rate cuts could lead to a correction in risky assets, including BTC. *This is not investment advice.

With a lot of speculation about the token’s upside circling around, the rally has brought a lot of attention to the Pi Cycle Top Indicator. Using the 111-day and a modified 350-day moving averages to predict when the token might approach the end of the bull run , the Pi Cycle Top Indicator has historically been known as one of the most accurate market timing tools in crypto . According to market analyst Rekt Capital, the averages now suggest that Bitcoin could peak between $130,000 and $170,000 as early as late 2025. Bitcoin Pi Cycle Top Indicator. Source: Rekt Capital Bitcoin upside up to $170,000 According to Rekt Capital’s analysis, the recent momentum is pushing the 111-day moving average up rapidly. Indeed, on June 1, the average was sitting around $92,000, but has since then jumped to approximately $98,000. Accordingly, the projected date of the moving average crossover is being adjusted as well, now being expected to occur in February 2027 as opposed to April 2027, projected just days ago. However, if Bitcoin maintains its upward trajectory, that projection could slide further forward into 2026, or even late 2025, when Bitcoin could potentially hit $170,000. Bitcoin & The Pi Cycle Top Indicator – A Crucial Update https://t.co/krUSKzbt5C #BTC #Crypto #Bitcoin — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) July 16, 2025 What do analysts say? Last week, technical analyst Rich Ross from Evercore stated that Bitcoin was “ coiled like a spring ,” with potential upside targets of up to $170,000 as well. Ross’s predictions were the result of bullish momentum Bitcoin was gaining due to rising geopolitical tensions, particularly following President Donald Trump’s announcement of sweeping new tariffs. On July 15, prominent analyst Trader Tardigrade likewise reported a bullish outlook in a post on X. Namely, the analyst pointed out that a slightly elevated Inverse Head and Shoulders ( IH&S ) weekly chart pattern suggests that Bitcoin could soon reach a target of approximately $160,000.

2025-07-16T09:30:19,"Unveiling the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Navigating Shifting Market Sentiment","BitcoinWorld Unveiling the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Navigating Shifting Market Sentiment Are you tracking the pulse of the cryptocurrency market? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is often considered a crucial barometer, offering a snapshot of investor psychology. Recently, this key indicator, provided by software development platform Alternative, registered a reading of 70 as of July 16. This figure, while a three-point dip from the previous day, keeps the market firmly within the ‘Greed’ zone. But what does this really mean for your crypto holdings and potential future moves? Let’s dive deeper into understanding this fascinating tool and how it can inform your trading strategies . What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Does it Matter? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a powerful analytical tool designed to measure the prevailing market sentiment in the cryptocurrency space. Ranging from 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed), it aims to provide insights into whether investors are overly fearful or excessively greedy. Why is this important? Because extreme fear can present buying opportunities for those brave enough, while extreme greed often signals that a market correction might be around the corner. Understanding this index helps you gauge the collective emotional state of the market, which is often a precursor to significant price movements. When the market is in ‘Extreme Fear,’ it suggests that prices are low and investors are selling off, potentially creating a dip for strategic entry. Conversely, ‘Extreme Greed’ indicates high prices and euphoria, which can lead to overvaluation and subsequent corrections. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? The index isn’t just a random number; it’s a weighted average of several key factors, each contributing to the overall score. This multi-faceted approach provides a more holistic view of market dynamics. Here’s a breakdown of the components: Volatility (25%): This measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average over the last 30 and 90 days. Higher volatility often indicates fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This component assesses the current volume and market momentum. High buying volumes in a strong market often suggest greedy behavior. Social Media (15%): The index analyzes Twitter hashtags and sentiment around Bitcoin, looking for an unusual number of posts and specific keywords to gauge public mood. Surveys (15%): While currently paused, these surveys previously gathered insights from investors about their market perceptions. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): This factor looks at Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market cap. A rising Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate fear, as investors might be fleeing altcoins for the relative safety of Bitcoin. Google Trends (10%): By analyzing search queries for terms like ‘Bitcoin price manipulation’ or ‘Bitcoin bubble,’ the index can infer the level of fear or optimism among retail investors. This comprehensive methodology allows the index to capture various aspects of investor behavior, from trading activity to public discourse, offering a nuanced perspective on market sentiment . Navigating the ‘Greed’ Zone: What Does 70 Mean for Crypto Volatility? A reading of 70, firmly in the ‘Greed’ zone, suggests that investors are generally optimistic and eager to buy. While this sounds positive, it’s a double-edged sword. On one hand, it indicates strong buying pressure and potential for further price appreciation. On the other hand, it also signals caution. When greed becomes excessive, markets can become overheated, leading to speculative bubbles. The recent three-point drop from 73 to 70, even within the ‘Greed’ zone, could be interpreted as a slight cooling of exuberance or a minor shift in sentiment. It’s not a dramatic plunge into fear, but rather a subtle indication that some of the intense buying pressure might be easing. This is particularly relevant when considering crypto volatility , as high greed levels can precede sharp corrections. Is High Bitcoin Dominance a Sign of Fear or Strength? The role of Bitcoin dominance within the index is often debated. When Bitcoin’s market share increases, it can mean a couple of things. Historically, during periods of uncertainty or fear, investors tend to consolidate their holdings into Bitcoin, perceiving it as a safer, more established asset compared to smaller altcoins. This ‘flight to quality’ drives up Bitcoin’s dominance. However, Bitcoin dominance can also rise during strong bull markets if Bitcoin leads the rally. The index specifically looks at the trend of dominance relative to overall market conditions. A sharp rise in dominance without a corresponding overall market rally might indeed signal a cautious sentiment, where investors are de-risking from altcoins. Actionable Insights: Using the Index in Your Trading Strategies The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a valuable tool, but it should never be your sole guide. Here’s how you can integrate it into your trading strategies : Counter-Cyclical Investing: A common adage in investing is to be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful. When the index is in ‘Extreme Fear’ (0-24), it might be a good time to consider accumulating assets, assuming your fundamental analysis supports the move. When it’s in ‘Extreme Greed’ (75-100), it might be prudent to take some profits or reduce exposure. Confirmation Tool: Use the index to confirm your existing analysis. If your technical indicators suggest a market top and the index is showing ‘Extreme Greed,’ it strengthens your sell signal. Similarly, if your analysis points to a buying opportunity and the index is in ‘Extreme Fear,’ it adds conviction. Risk Management: A high ‘Greed’ reading should prompt you to re-evaluate your risk exposure. Are you over-leveraged? Is your portfolio too heavily weighted in highly speculative assets? This is a time to tighten stop-losses and perhaps rebalance. Understand Nuance: A score of 70 is ‘Greed,’ but it’s not ‘Extreme Greed.’ This suggests a strong market, but perhaps not yet at the point of irrational exuberance. It’s a reminder to stay alert but not necessarily panic. Challenges and Limitations While powerful, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index has limitations: Lagging Indicator: The index often reflects sentiment that has already developed. Prices might have moved significantly before the index fully captures the shift. Bitcoin-Centric: While it aims to capture overall crypto sentiment, its components are heavily weighted towards Bitcoin. Altcoin-specific sentiment might differ. Not a Crystal Ball: It cannot predict the future with certainty. Unexpected news or black swan events can override any sentiment reading. Psychological Bias: Even knowing the index is in ‘Greed’ doesn’t mean you can easily overcome your own fear of missing out (FOMO) or fear of losing (FOL). What’s Next for Crypto Market Sentiment? The current reading of 70 in the ‘Greed’ zone, despite a slight dip, indicates a robust and optimistic market. Investors are still largely confident, which is a positive sign for continued interest and potential growth. However, vigilance is key. As the index approaches the higher end of the ‘Greed’ spectrum, the potential for increased crypto volatility and subsequent pullbacks rises. Monitoring the index alongside other fundamental and technical analysis will be crucial for navigating the evolving landscape of the crypto market. Pay close attention to upcoming macroeconomic data, regulatory news, and significant on-chain metrics. These external factors can quickly shift sentiment, pushing the index either higher into ‘Extreme Greed’ or lower towards ‘Fear.’ The beauty of the crypto market lies in its dynamic nature, and staying informed is your best defense. Conclusion: Mastering the Market’s Mood The Crypto Fear & Greed Index provides invaluable insights into the collective psyche of cryptocurrency investors. Its recent reading of 70, holding strong in the ‘Greed’ zone, signals ongoing optimism but also warrants a cautious approach. By understanding its components, particularly the role of Bitcoin dominance and the implications of crypto volatility , you can refine your trading strategies and make more informed decisions. Remember, while sentiment is a powerful force, it’s just one piece of the puzzle. Combine it with thorough research and sound risk management to truly master the market’s mood.

2025-07-16T09:27:59,"Top 3 BTC alternatives to grab in July, one still trading below $0.05 with serious upside","With staking rewards, mtTokens that auto-generate yield, and a $100K giveaway underway, this is not just another token—it’s a next-gen income machine backed by real DeFi mechanics and a full CertiK audit. Another promising contender is Toncoin (TON), the native asset of the Telegram-backed TON blockchain. It’s gaining momentum thanks to deep integration with social platforms, giving it mainstream exposure. But despite its user base, TON still lacks the income-driven architecture that makes MUTM more appealing for long-term holders. Finally, Injective (INJ) is gaining respect for its scalable Layer-1 infrastructure and on-chain finance tools. It’s strong on tech, but its value flow is still speculative. Compared to MUTM’s lending fees, buybacks, and treasury-backed stablecoin development, Injective looks more like a bet. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), however, looks like a blueprint. Where yield meets utility What separates Mutuum Finance (MUTM) from typical Bitcoin (BTC) alternatives is its focus on real-time, utility-driven revenue mechanics. The platform will enable users to lend major crypto assets into smart contract-powered liquidity pools using a system called P2C—Peer-to-Contract. Once launched, users who deposit assets will receive mtTokens that not only represent their original holdings but will also grow in value as interest accrues over time. These ERC-20 mtTokens will be stakeable within the designated contracts, adding a second layer of rewards, turning passive deposits into long-term, compounding income streams. Here’s what that could look like once the platform is live: a user supplies 4.5 ETH (around $11,250) into a high-utilization pool projected to earn 7.2% APY. That position alone would yield over $810 annually, with returns reflected directly in the increasing value of mtETH. Unlike legacy lending platforms that require manual re-depositing or lockups, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being designed with smart contract automation, allowing users to earn without additional steps. And because mtTokens will be fully tradable and stakeable, users will be able to maximize earnings across different layers of the protocol. This vision isn’t just for whales. Thanks to Layer-2 infrastructure and a non-custodial architecture, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aims to make high-yield crypto lending accessible to all users, even those new to DeFi. The platform is being designed to remove complexity while enhancing transparency and control, allowing everyday users to put their assets to work in ways previously limited to institutional players. But not all risk appetites are the same, and that’s exactly where the upcoming Peer-to-Peer (P2P) engine will push Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s offering even further. High-risk yield with full control Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s P2P lending system is being developed for users who want to take calculated risks in exchange for higher returns. In this model, lenders and borrowers will be able to negotiate their own terms, from APY and loan duration to the collateral type. Rather than pooling funds, each loan agreement will be individually executed via smart contracts. This design prevents contagion and gives lenders the freedom to cherry-pick the deals that best fit their risk tolerance. A practical scenario: a user might lend 1,000 USDC to a borrower who posts worth of DOGE as collateral, agreeing to a 15% APY. The smart contract will lock in the terms and manage repayments, interest accrual, and automated liquidation if thresholds are breached. The lender would earn $150 in trustless profit if the loan is repaid on time. And because all loans will be overcollateralized, the protocol’s Stability Factor is designed to trigger third-party liquidators to seize collateral before lender capital is affected. This high-yield, low-contagion model is already attracting attention from crypto-native investors eager for better returns on stablecoins and volatile tokens like SHIB, PEPE, or FLOKI. Presale momentum is heating up Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently deep into Phase 5 of its token presale, priced at $0.03 with more than 75% already sold. The project has now raised over $12.35 million from a growing community of over 13,300 holders, and the next pricing tier at $0.035 will mark a 20% increase. With a fixed supply of 4 billion MUTM tokens, scarcity is built into the protocol’s long-term design, and early movers are positioning accordingly. Security-wise, the project is backed by a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program in partnership with CertiK, one of the most respected blockchain audit firms. With a Token Scan Score of 95 and a Skynet Score of 77, the platform is taking every step to ensure transparency and technical robustness before going live. With a listing price of $0.06 already confirmed, buyers from Phase 2 (who entered at $0.015) have already doubled their investment. Analysts tracking the protocol are forecasting 5x to 10x gains from current levels, especially once the beta platform goes live and mtTokens become fully usable. For investors waiting on the sidelines, Phase 5 is shaping up to be the final window before demand floods in ahead of the exchange launch. In a market where few tokens offer both upside and utility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is proving that it belongs on the shortlist of Bitcoin (BTC) alternatives to watch—and possibly act on—this July.

Analyst AxelAdlerJr said in a thread that Peak Signal appears when “the combined normalized Market to Realized Price Index and 30 day/ 365 day Value Days Destroyed ratio score reaches or exceeds 1.” The world’s largest crypto rallied past $122,000 on Monday , driven by renewed institutional interest, and favourable policy. However, it retracted and is now trading at $118,231 at press time. Alexander Zahnd, interim CEO of Zilliqa, calls it a signal that crypto has entered a new phase, where “institutional confidence is driving consistent demand.” He emphasized the quality of the rally this time. “It’s spot-driven, not built on leverage, and it’s unfolding in a relatively calm market,” he told Cryptonews. “That points to a more mature and resilient structure compared to previous cycles.” Bitcoin Could Eventually Hit $130K if Momentum Holds According to Zahnd, Bitcoin’s next bullish key level could be $123,200, with room to push toward $126,500 and eventually $130,000, provided, momentum holds. However, on the downside, BTC would plunge toward $115,000 or $112,000, which could “still be healthy in the broader trend,” he added. “At a macro level, concerns about rising debt, persistent inflation, and uncertainty in monetary policy are all reinforcing the idea of Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. That dynamic isn’t going away anytime soon.” Only Broader Institutional Participation Can Propel BTC to $150K Swiftly Andrejs Balans, risk manager of EU-based fintech platform YouHodler, said that inflows alone will not help propel Bitcoin to $150,000 swiftly. A broader shift in institutional sentiment could be a major catalyst to drive BTC prices up, Balans told Cryptonews. Though institutional exposure has increased through ETFs and custody services, senior banking executives have reiterated their cautious stance, describing crypto as an area of interest but not yet a strategic priority. “Without a broad shift in institutional sentiment, it is unlikely that inflows alone will propel Bitcoin to $150,000 swiftly.” The post Bitcoin ‘Peak Signal’ Not in Yet, Rally May Continue: CryptoQuant Analyst appeared first on Cryptonews .",cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-peak-signal-not-in-yet-rally-may-continue-cryptoquant-analyst/,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET","Bitcoin News|Bitcoin ATH|Bitcoin market",cryptocompare

Brooklyn resident Xerxes Shevar, 57, was part of a prolific international conspiracy ring involving scammers in the United States, Ghana, Nigeria and Ireland, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania. The US Attorney says the conspirators obtained stolen identity info on the internet and then submitted fraudulent federal tax returns under the names of those identities. The alleged scammers also opened bank accounts in those names to receive the returns from the IRS. One of Shevar’s co-conspirators alleges the scam ring attempted to secure around $38 million from the IRS between the tax years 2010 and 2013 and ended up receiving more than $10 million. The scammers allegedly used stolen identities to open 3,493 bank accounts and obtain 4,563 credit cards across 443 financial institutions. In all, the scam ring allegedly victimized 11,468 individuals. Shevar was arrested in February 2024 when he returned to the United States from Ghana. The Brooklyn resident was convicted of wire fraud conspiracy, and US District Judge Susan Paradise Baxter sentenced him earlier this month to three years of probation. The judge also ordered him to pay $290,000 in restitution.

While many companies are purchasing BTC, the latest move came from Cantor Fitzgerald, the company run by US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. According to the Financial Times, Howard Lutnick's company Cantor Fitzgerald is in talks with Adam Back and his company Blockstream to purchase approximately $4 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC). This move is seen as another bold move by Brandon Lutnick, who replaced the company's CEO Howard Lutnick after he was confirmed as the 41st US Secretary of Commerce. Lutnick had previously signed a $3.6 billion Bitcoin deal with SoftBank and Tether in April. According to the FT, citing two unnamed sources, Cantor Fitzgerald-backed Cantor Equity Partners is in final-stage talks with Back to purchase $3 billion to $4 billion worth of BTC. Under the agreement, Cantor will receive Bitcoin from Adam Back. In exchange for Back's Bitcoin contribution, Back and Blockstream will each receive a stake in the SPAC. Cantor Equity Partners is a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) that raised $200 million in its initial public offering in January. Although the deal has reportedly not been finalized yet, it could be finalized this week. *This is not investment advice.

Many altcoins have posted impressive gains over the past day, led by Ethereum’s 6% surge to a five-month high. BTC Eyes $119K The primary cryptocurrency’s historic ascent began last Wednesday. At the time, it was confined in a tight range with an upper boundary of $110,000, which managed to contain the asset during a few breakout attempts. However, the bulls took charge on Wednesday evening and pushed through it to a new all-time high of $112,000. The gains continued in the following 48 hours, and BTC topped at almost $119,000. Following a relatively quiet weekend, bitcoin jumped further on Monday and registered its latest ATH of just over $123,000 . After skyrocketing by $15,000 in five days, the asset was due for a cool-off, which took place yesterday. Amid billions of realized profits , shaky US CPI data , and some uncertainty in the global political scene, bitcoin slipped by several grand and dipped below $116,000. It has reacted well following this decline and has recovered almost $3,000. It now sits close to $119,000, with a market capitalization of $2.360 trillion. Its dominance over the alts, though, has taken a hit and is down to 61.7% as many altcoins have produced bigger gains. BTCUSD.

2025-07-16T09:00:29,"Citigroup CEO Confirms Interest In Issuing A Proprietary Stablecoin—Reuters","American multinational investment bank Citigroup announced plans to potentially issue its stablecoin, as CEO Jane Fraser revealed during a post-earnings conference call. As first reported by Reuters, Fraser emphasized the bank’s focus on both the stablecoin initiative and the growing tokenized deposit sector, stating, “This is a good opportunity for us.” As the third-largest lender in the United States, Citigroup is also exploring solutions for reserve management related to stablecoins and providing custody services for cryptocurrency assets. Citigroup’s Plan For New Stablecoin Initiative This announcement follows a strong second-quarter performance for Citigroup, which saw its shares reach their highest levels since the 2008 financial crisis. The bank reported earnings that exceeded Wall Street expectations and unveiled plans to buy back at least $4 billion in stock, further bolstering investor confidence. Related Reading: Unraveling The Bitcoin Boom: Experts Decode Record $123,000 Surge The timing of Citigroup’s stablecoin discussions coincides with the Republican Party’s “Crypto Week,” a campaign aimed at advancing crucial legislation to establish a regulatory framework for digital assets. Among the key proposals is the GENIUS Act, designed to facilitate the adoption of stablecoins within the traditional financial ecosystem. However, the path to regulatory approval has faced challenges. Legislative Setback For Crypto President Donald Trump called for swift passage of the GENIUS Act and the CLARITY Act, promoting them as pivotal for the United States to maintain its leadership in digital assets. In a Tuesday post on Truth Social, Trump proclaimed: The House will soon VOTE on a tremendous Bill to Make America the UNDISPUTED, NUMBER ONE LEADER in Digital Assets – Nobody does it better! The GENIUS Act is going to put our Great Nation lightyears ahead of China, Europe, and all others, who are trying endlessly to catch up, but they just can’t do it. Digital Assets are the FUTURE, and we are leading by a lot! Get the first Vote done this afternoon (ALL REPUBLICANS SHOULD VOTE YES!). Despite this push, the House of Representatives voted against the bill, with the final tally standing at 196-223. Notably, 13 Republican representatives joined Democrats in opposing the motion, marking a rare instance of dissent within the party. Related Reading: TD Cowen Projects Bitcoin At $155K By Year-End, Raises Strategy’s Price Target Fox journalist Eleanor Terret reported that some House members expressed concerns that the GENIUS Act could inadvertently pave the way for a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). However, the bill includes provisions explicitly prohibiting the Federal Reserve from directly offering services to the public, ensuring that it cannot authorize initiatives like digital wallets or personal accounts related to CBDCs. The ultimate fate of these crucial crypto bills in the US Congress remains to be seen, as does whether this recent decision will cause financial giants to pause their plans to issue or adopt a major stablecoin for their clients.

2025-07-16T09:00:00,"BitMine Shares Soar After Peter Thiel Investment","BitMine surged by close to 400% after it debuted in the US in May, and recently disclosed it holds over $500 million in Ethereum. Meanwhile, Vanguard became the largest institutional shareholder of Strategy (MSTR), despite publicly criticizing cryptocurrencies and refusing to offer Bitcoin ETFs. Separately, Bitcoin miner MARA expanded its BTC yield strategy by boosting its allocation with Two Prime from 500 to 2,000 BTC. BitMine Gains Big After Thiel Buys In Shares in BitMine Immersion Technologies surged 12.5% in after-hours trading on Tuesday after the disclosure that billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel acquired a large stake in the company. According to a regulatory filing , Thiel bought 5.09 million shares through various entities under his Founders Fund, which amounts to a 9.1% ownership in the crypto mining service provider. The move happened during a flurry of crypto-related activity tied to Thiel, who is also known for co-founding PayPal and Palantir Technologies, and has a reported net worth of $22.7 billion. Peter Thiel Thiel has been increasingly active in the crypto and fintech space. Earlier this month, he joined other tech billionaires in applying for a bank charter for Erebor , a new financial institution that plans to fill the void left by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023. Additionally, his firm was reportedly leading a $200 million funding round for prediction market platform Polymarket, valued at $1 billion. Meanwhile, Bullish, a Thiel-backed digital asset exchange, reportedly filed confidential paperwork to pursue an initial public offering. BitMine’s stock closed down 2.5% on Tuesday at $44.97 but rallied in after-hours trading. This allowed it to hit $48.50 at one point. Since its US debut on May 8 at $8 per share, BitMine’s stock soared by close to 400%. In its most recent quarterly report, the company announced a 67.5% year-on-year increase in net revenue and a 43.18% rise in net profits. BitMine share price over the past 24 hours (Source: Google Finance ) Another sign of its deepening crypto strategy is BitMine announcement on Monday that it now holds over $500 million in Ethereum (ETH) in its treasury. The company accumulated more than 163,000 ETH at an average purchase price of $3,072 per token. This massive acquisition was funded through a $250 million private placement that concluded on July 9. Vanguard Becomes Top Strategy Holder Even the most traditional forces in finance are becoming entangled in crypto’s influence. Vanguard, one of the world’s largest investment firms, recently became the biggest institutional shareholder of Strategy (MSTR), the company led by Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor. According to data from Fintel , Vanguard now holds more than 20 million shares of MSTR, which accounts for roughly 8% of its Class A common stock. This gives the firm indirect exposure to more than 200,000 Bitcoin held on Strategy’s balance sheet. (Source: Fintel ) Strategy features in various Vanguard mutual funds and ETFs, including the widely held Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund. Its position in Strategy arises from the firm’s passive investing strategy, which tracks broad market indices and includes companies regardless of their business models or leadership ideologies. Despite its exposure to Bitcoin through Strategy, Vanguard is still publicly skeptical of cryptocurrencies. The firm repeatedly warned investors about the risks of volatile digital assets and chose not to offer spot Bitcoin ETFs, even as rivals like BlackRock surged ahead. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has become its most profitable ETF and is expected to cross $100 billion in assets under management. Vanguard’s CEO Salim Ramji said in a May interview with Bloomberg TV that Vanguard prioritizes long-term dependability over chasing financial trends, and that the company is not in the business of speculative assets. In a separate interview with ETF.com, Ramji held firm that Bitcoin doesn’t align with Vanguard’s 50-year investment philosophy. The firm’s unexpected exposure to Bitcoin reignited conversations around the passive investing model. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas pointed out the irony by explaining that index funds must include all stocks in a benchmark — even those the managers may disapprove of. “God has a sense of humor,” Balchunas said , due to the paradox of one of Bitcoin’s biggest corporate holders being backed by one of its most vocal institutional critics. MARA Invests in Two Prime MARA Holdings also recently completed a minority acquisition of institutional investment adviser Two Prime. The deal included a $20 million equity investment, and it greatly increased MARA’s Bitcoin allocation with Two Prime from 500 BTC to 2,000 BTC. These holdings will be placed in a Separately Managed Account that is designed to generate yield. Two Prime is registered with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It provides Bitcoin exposure and management services to institutional clients and professional investors. MARA’s decision to grow its stake in Two Prime forms part of its strategy to diversify and make better use of its Bitcoin holdings, which were initially built through self-mining and later expanded via stock sales. This pivot happened as Bitcoin miners, including MARA, face growing pressure after the latest halving event, which cut block rewards in half and reduced revenue potential across the industry. Despite posting a 30% increase in revenue to $214 million in the first quarter, MARA reported a net loss of $533 million, driven by rising energy and equipment costs. In response, many miners are now exploring alternative revenue models, including hosting AI data centers and repurposing infrastructure for high-performance computing.

2025-07-16T08:59:07,"Michigan town with no Bitcoin Kiosks plans to impose strict rules on crypto ATMs","Grosse Pointe Farms, a small town in Michigan, USA, is the latest to join a growing list of US municipalities imposing strict regulations on cryptocurrency ATMs. Grosse Pointe Farms’s city council has recently passed an ordinance targeting the regulation of crypto kiosks, popularly known as Bitcoin ATMs, despite the town not currently having any such machines. Officials say the decision was fuelled by recent reports of a local being defrauded through a crypto ATM in nearby St. Clair Shores. The ordinance was passed unanimously during a city council meeting, making Grosse Pointe Farms one of the first municipalities in Michigan to formally regulate cryptocurrency kiosks. City attorney Bill Burgess outlined four key measures included in the ordinance. Notably, Operators of future crypto ATMs will be required to register with the Department of Public Safety and obtain a business license prior to deployment. The ordinance also mandates that operators display warning signs that alert users of the risks of fraud and the irreversible nature of crypto transactions. On top of that, new users will be subject to transaction caps during their initial two-week period. Specifically, first-time users will be limited to $1,000 per day and $5,000 in total transactions within the first 14 days. The limits are being put in place to provide a buffer period for users to familiarise themselves with the machines before conducting higher-value transfers. During the meeting, council member Lev Wood stated that the objective of this ordinance was to improve transparency and prevent residents from falling victim to any further scams. “The crooks tell people to go and put money into these machines, and it’s a very untransparent situation. What we want to do with our ordinance tonight is to enhance transparency and provide a little bit of help to our residents,” Wood said. Crypto ATMs, like standard ATMs, allow anyone to convert their fiat currency to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum and vice versa. However, the anonymous and irreversible nature of cryptocurrency transactions and the fact that Bitcoin ATM transactions often lack identity verification have made these kiosks a tool for scammers to launder illicit loot . Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel has previously issued statewide warnings about scams tied to crypto ATMs, urging residents to be careful when asked to send money through these machines. Local media, including the Detroit Free Press, have also reported multiple incidents involving unsuspecting residents. US states are cracking down on crypto ATMs Similar concerns have prompted several other US states and cities to enact their own restrictions or regulations on crypto ATMs in recent months. In Washington state, the city of Spokane recently became the first in the state to outright ban cryptocurrency kiosks. The Spokane City Council passed the measure unanimously, ordering all operators to remove their kiosks within 60 days. Before that, Nebraska signed the Controllable Electronic Record Fraud Prevention Act into law in March, which mandates operational licenses, transaction caps of $2,000 for new users, and refund policies for those defrauded. Similarly, North Dakota lawmakers passed House Bill 1447 earlier this year, formally imposing a $2,000 daily transaction cap, mandating blockchain analytics for fraud detection, and requiring operators to submit quarterly reports. Arizona also passed a similar bill earlier this year, setting a lower daily transaction limit of $1,000 along with mandatory licensing and consumer protection measures.

Strategy’s (MSTR) aggressive bitcoin BTC acquisition strategy has dramatically boosted the value of its convertible debt. With bitcoin steady near its record price and the company's shares rebounding toward $450, five of the six bonds outstanding are deep in the money, meaning the stock price exceeds their conversion prices. Only the 2029 note, with a high $672.40 conversion price, remains out of reach. The Tysons Corner, Virginia-based company issued convertible notes totaling $8.2 billion in notional principal with ultra-low average coupons of just 0.421%. The bonds, which mature between 2028 and 2032, carry a set price based on MSTR and BTC levels at the time of issues at which the debt can turn into the common stock. MSTR stock has rebounded from as low as $235 three months ago and is within sight of late last year's $543 record. The rally has pushed the bonds’ market value to $13.4 billion, roughly $5.2 billion above their notional value. The premium reflects how much investors are willing to pay in secondary markets, driven by the bonds’ potential to convert into valuable equity. Of late, however, Strategy has paused issuing new convertible notes. That may be due to more cautious sentiment as reflected in the options market. As of July 15, MSTR’s implied volatility sits at 53.1%, well below past highs above 200%. Implied volatility is an indication of how much the options traders believes the stock will move in the future based on their market positioning. Open interest remains healthy at over 2.4 million contracts, but both the open interest put-call ratio (0.93) and the volume put-call ratio (0.62) indicate neutral sentiment, suggesting traders are not aggressively betting on a major surge in the stock. A put is a cautious position that offers protection against price declines in the underlying asset while a call is a bullish instrument that allows traders to profit when the price rises. Additionally, trading volume is just 20% of its 30-day average, hinting at reduced speculative interest. This muted options activity implies that while MSTR’s price is high enough to put five of the six convertible bonds deep in the money, there may not be the same frothy market enthusiasm that allowed the company to issue convertibles at ultra-low coupons and favorable terms. Investors might demand higher yields or lower conversion prices for any new issuance, which could dilute existing shareholders sooner.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/16/strategys-convertible-bond-prices-surge-as-stock-advances-back-toward-record-high,"MARKET|BUSINESS|TRADING|BTC","Markets|MicroStrategy|Bitcoin|Bonds|News",cryptocompare

Is this something for investors to be concerned about, or was this just a blip in Bitcoin’s rise into the final leg of the bull market? Bitcoin was just too overbought US CPI data came in slightly hotter than expected, causing a 0.4% fall in the S&P 500 Index, but the tech-heavy Nasdaq ended the day higher. Now these inflation figures are known and priced in, some stability can potentially return to markets, that is of course, if Wednesday’s PPI figures do not cause more concerns. As far as Bitcoin was concerned, the latest sharp correction was far more likely to be caused by too much elation and overbuying than the odd 0.1% on top of the expected US monthly inflation print. On just about every short-term indicator the $BTC price was very overbought and a market-calming correction was exactly what was needed. While the sharpness of the correction perhaps caught many investors by surprise, it certainly helped to reset the market. $BTC price starts to build again Source: TradingView The 4-hour chart reveals how the $BTC price breakout and surge up to the all-time high was just as quickly negated with an even bigger price move to the downside. That said, now that the dip is potentially over with, the bulls have the opportunity to start bringing the price back to the top. The Fibonacci extensions are showing that the price is consolidating above the first 0.236 level. It might be expected that more price growth could take place from here. A tale of wicks Source: TradingView The daily chart shows the long candle wick to the upside left behind after the two-day dip. That said, a long wick was left in the opposite direction following the rapid recovery. The bulls will be hoping that the last one cancels out the first one. At the bottom of the chart, the RSI is showing that the indicator has moved back down, although it is angled slightly up as of Wednesday morning. The dashed blue line shows that the indicator is still in a downtrend. This will need to be broken to the upside for price to continue to move higher. Source: TradingView The weekly gives a more damning view of the candle wick to the upside. Looking across at similar-sized candle wicks to the upside during previous price history, it should be noted that they did generally show up at the tops of downtrends. Nevertheless, the $BTC price is only 3 days into this week, and with potentially more upside to come, this wick is probably going to reduce in size. The RSI at the bottom of the chart is in a similar condition to the daily. A downtrend has been in force for quite some time, and this will need to be broken if price is to continue going higher. Correction made - time to move on? Yes, Bitcoin did descend precipitously, and more than $7,000 was wiped off of the price in a very short space of time. However, in the grand scheme of things this is very likely to be just a blip. In addition, these corrections are healthy and they allow the build up of air to be released out of the bottle before the market gets too frothy and we end up with a perilous cascade of selling. Bitcoin has had its correction, and now it’s time to move on and continue into the rest of this bull market, US PPI data allowing of course.

2025-07-16T08:40:27,"Meta AI: Critical Security Bug Resolved, Safeguarding User Prompts","BitcoinWorld Meta AI: Critical Security Bug Resolved, Safeguarding User Prompts In the rapidly evolving digital landscape, where the promise of artificial intelligence (AI) converges with the foundational principles of blockchain and decentralization, the security of our digital interactions is paramount. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and tech-savvy individuals, understanding the vulnerabilities within cutting-edge AI platforms like Meta AI is crucial, especially when it concerns the privacy of personal data. Recently, Meta addressed a significant security flaw in its AI chatbot, a fix that underscores the ongoing battle to protect user information in the age of generative AI. Unpacking the Meta AI Vulnerability: What Happened to User Prompts? The core of this security incident revolved around a flaw that allowed unauthorized access to users’ private AI prompts and their generated responses. Sandeep Hodkasia, the astute founder of security testing firm Appsecure, was the one to unearth this critical vulnerability. He exclusively shared his findings with Bitcoin World, detailing how he privately disclosed the bug to Meta on December 26, 2024. For his diligent work and responsible disclosure, Meta paid him a substantial $10,000 in a bug bounty reward. Hodkasia’s discovery stemmed from his meticulous examination of how Meta AI enables logged-in users to edit their AI prompts to regenerate text and images. He found that when a user modified their prompt, Meta’s back-end servers would assign a unique, numerical identifier to both the prompt and its AI-generated response. The critical flaw emerged when Hodkasia analyzed the network traffic in his browser during a prompt edit. He realized he could manipulate this unique number, and Meta’s servers, without proper verification, would return the prompt and AI-generated response of an entirely different user. This meant Meta’s servers were failing to perform a fundamental security check: ensuring that the user requesting the prompt and its response was actually authorized to view it. Hodkasia noted that these prompt numbers were “easily guessable,” posing a significant risk. A malicious actor could potentially scrape vast amounts of users’ original prompts and their AI-generated content by rapidly iterating through these numbers using automated tools, compromising the privacy of countless individuals. The Indispensable Role of Bug Bounty Programs: A Shield for Innovation Meta’s swift response and the subsequent $10,000 payout to Sandeep Hodkasia highlight the critical importance of bug bounty programs in today’s digital security landscape. These programs incentivize ethical hackers and security researchers to identify and responsibly disclose vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by malicious actors. Instead of waiting for a breach to occur, companies proactively invite experts to test their systems, turning potential adversaries into allies. Key Benefits of Bug Bounty Programs: Proactive Security: They allow companies to identify and fix vulnerabilities before they are publicly exploited, significantly reducing the risk of data breaches and reputational damage. Diverse Expertise: By opening their systems to a global community of security researchers, companies gain access to a vast pool of diverse skills and perspectives, often uncovering issues that internal teams might miss. Cost-Effective: While bounties can be substantial, they are often far less costly than recovering from a major security breach, which can involve significant financial penalties, legal fees, and customer churn. Enhanced Trust: Publicly acknowledging and rewarding researchers for their findings builds trust with users and demonstrates a company’s commitment to security and transparency. In this instance, Meta confirmed to Bitcoin World that they fixed the bug in January 2025 and, crucially, “found no evidence of abuse and rewarded the researcher,” as stated by Meta spokesperson Ryan Daniels. This outcome underscores the success of the bug bounty model: a vulnerability was identified, responsibly disclosed, patched, and users remained safe. Navigating Data Privacy in the AI Frontier: Why It Matters More Than Ever The news of this Meta AI bug comes at a pivotal time when tech giants are intensely competing to launch and refine their AI products. However, this rapid innovation often runs parallel to significant security and data privacy risks. AI models, by their very nature, process immense volumes of data, much of which can be highly personal or sensitive. Ensuring the privacy and security of this data is a monumental challenge. Meta AI’s standalone app, which debuted to compete with rivals like ChatGPT, faced a rocky start earlier, with some users inadvertently sharing what they believed were private conversations with the chatbot. This incident, combined with the recently patched prompt leakage bug, highlights a broader industry challenge: balancing the excitement of AI’s capabilities with the fundamental right to privacy. Challenges in AI Data Privacy: Data Volume and Diversity: AI models ingest vast and varied datasets, making it complex to track and secure every piece of information. Inference Risks: AI can infer sensitive attributes about individuals even from seemingly innocuous data, creating new privacy concerns. Model Memorization: Large language models can sometimes “memorize” parts of their training data, potentially regurgitating private information if not properly handled. Prompt Engineering Exposure: As seen with Meta AI, the very input users provide to AI can be sensitive, making prompt security paramount. For platforms building on decentralized principles, like many in the crypto space, the emphasis on user control and transparency serves as a strong counterpoint to these centralized AI challenges. The incident with Meta AI serves as a stark reminder that robust privacy-by-design principles must be integrated into every stage of AI development, not as an afterthought. Protecting Your User Prompts : A New Frontier of Digital Assets? While a simple text input, a “user prompt” to an AI chatbot can contain a wealth of personal, creative, or even proprietary information. Imagine a user brainstorming a new business idea, drafting sensitive emails, or even generating creative content for a novel. The leakage of such user prompts could lead to intellectual property theft, reputational damage, or the exposure of private thoughts and plans. In the context of generative AI, prompts are not merely inputs; they are often the genesis of unique outputs, making their privacy as critical as the privacy of personal messages or financial data. This incident prompts users to consider their interactions with AI platforms with a heightened sense of awareness. Actionable Insights for AI Users: Be Mindful of Sensitive Information: Avoid inputting highly personal, financial, or confidential company data into public AI chatbots. Understand Platform Privacy Policies: Take the time to read how AI services handle your data, prompts, and generated content. Utilize Secure Channels: For sensitive AI-driven tasks, explore enterprise-grade or privacy-focused AI solutions that offer stronger data protection. Regularly Review Settings: Check privacy and security settings on your AI accounts to ensure they align with your preferences. The concept of a prompt as a valuable, protectable asset is gaining traction, especially as AI becomes more integral to creative and professional workflows. This incident underscores the need for both platforms and users to treat prompts with the same care afforded to other forms of digital intellectual property. Strengthening AI Security : The Path Forward for a Safer Digital World The Meta AI bug fix is a testament to the continuous and often challenging work required to maintain robust AI security in a rapidly advancing technological landscape. As AI systems become more complex and deeply integrated into our daily lives, the potential attack surface expands, demanding constant vigilance and innovative security measures. The lessons learned from this incident extend beyond Meta. They serve as a crucial reminder for all AI developers and deployers to prioritize security and privacy from the ground up. This includes implementing rigorous authorization checks, employing robust encryption, conducting regular security audits, and fostering strong relationships with the cybersecurity research community through initiatives like bug bounty programs. For the broader tech community, especially those within the blockchain and cryptocurrency spheres, the emphasis on transparent, auditable, and secure systems resonates deeply. The future of AI hinges not just on its intelligence and capabilities, but fundamentally on the trust users place in its security and ethical operation. As AI continues to evolve, so too must our commitment to safeguarding the digital integrity and privacy of every user. The resolution of this critical Meta AI bug underscores the relentless effort required to secure our digital future. It highlights the invaluable role of ethical hackers and robust bug bounty programs in protecting user data.

2025-07-16T08:30:24,"Bitcoin: Unwavering Accumulation by Long-Term Holders Amidst Market Swings","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin: Unwavering Accumulation by Long-Term Holders Amidst Market Swings In the often-turbulent world of cryptocurrency, where market sentiment can shift on a dime and price charts resemble roller coasters, a fascinating trend has emerged that speaks volumes about conviction: long-term Bitcoin holders are not just holding; they’re aggressively accumulating. This quiet but powerful movement of Bitcoin accumulation by seasoned investors offers a compelling counter-narrative to the prevailing market uncertainty. Why are Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Defying Market Gravity? July 2023 was a period marked by considerable apprehension across financial markets, and Bitcoin was no exception, seeing its price hover around the $30,000 mark after a period of volatility. Yet, amidst this backdrop, a remarkable statistic from CryptoQuant, highlighted by CryptoPotato, revealed that wallets traditionally associated with never-selling — often referred to as ‘HODLers’ — added an astonishing 248,000 BTC to their holdings. This figure isn’t just significant; it’s far above the monthly average, underscoring an unwavering belief in Bitcoin’s intrinsic value and future potential. This phenomenon isn’t new, but its intensity during a period of perceived weakness is particularly telling. It suggests that a core group of investors views price dips not as a reason to panic sell, but as opportune moments to acquire more. This behavior stands in stark contrast to the often-fickle nature of short-term trading, where fear and greed dictate immediate actions. For these dedicated investors, Bitcoin isn’t merely a speculative asset; it’s a foundational store of value, a hedge against inflation, and a decentralized digital future. What Drives This Remarkable Bitcoin Accumulation Trend? The motivations behind such robust Bitcoin accumulation are multi-faceted, rooted in both macro-economic outlooks and Bitcoin’s unique properties. Several key factors contribute to this long-term conviction: Digital Gold Narrative: Many view Bitcoin as the modern equivalent of gold, a finite asset that serves as a hedge against currency debasement and economic instability. In times of global uncertainty, the appeal of a decentralized, immutable asset grows stronger. Halving Event Anticipation: With the next Bitcoin halving event on the horizon (expected in 2024), which historically precedes significant bull runs due to reduced supply, long-term holders are strategically positioning themselves to capitalize on potential future price appreciation. Growing Institutional Interest: Despite market fluctuations, institutional adoption continues to slowly but steadily increase. The prospect of Bitcoin ETFs and growing corporate interest validates Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, drawing in more serious capital. Technological Resilience: Bitcoin’s network has proven incredibly robust over more than a decade, with no downtime and increasing security. This reliability builds confidence among those looking for long-term investments. This strategic patience highlights a divergence in market philosophy. While day traders focus on short-term gains and losses, long-term holders are playing a different game, one focused on the fundamental value proposition of a decentralized, scarce digital asset. How Does This Impact Overall BTC Price Analysis ? The consistent and significant accumulation by long-term holders has profound implications for BTC price analysis , even if its immediate effects aren’t always visible. Here’s why this trend matters: Reduced Circulating Supply: When Bitcoin moves into long-term holding wallets, it effectively removes that supply from active circulation. This creates a supply shock over time, meaning fewer Bitcoins are available for sale on exchanges. Establishing a Price Floor: Strong accumulation during price dips can act as a natural buying pressure, potentially setting a more robust price floor for Bitcoin. It suggests that there’s significant demand at lower price levels, limiting downside risk. Indicator of Fundamental Strength: This behavior is a strong vote of confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term viability. It suggests that despite bearish short-term narratives or macro headwinds, a significant portion of the market believes in its ultimate success, which can influence broader sentiment over time. While accumulation alone doesn’t guarantee immediate parabolic price moves, it lays the groundwork for sustainable growth. It signifies that the asset is being held by conviction, rather than speculation, which is a healthier foundation for any market. Decoding the Current Crypto Market Sentiment : A Tale of Two Traders? The July accumulation trend paints a vivid picture of conflicting forces shaping current crypto market sentiment . On one side, we observe the steadfast conviction of long-term holders; on the other, the apprehension of some large traders and short-term speculators. This divergence creates a nuanced market environment: Metric Long-Term Holders (HODLers) Short-Term Traders / Large Bearish Traders Primary Goal Wealth preservation, long-term growth Short-term profit, capitalizing on volatility Reaction to Dips Accumulation (buying more) Selling (cutting losses, taking profits) Market View Fundamentally bullish Technically driven, often bearish in dips Impact on Supply Reduces circulating supply Increases circulating supply (selling pressure) This ‘tale of two traders’ highlights the maturity of the Bitcoin market. It’s no longer just a playground for quick gains; it’s a battleground of philosophies. Understanding this dynamic is crucial for investors navigating the mixed signals and deciding their own strategy. Embracing the Bitcoin HODL Strategy: Is it for You? The consistent success of long-term holders often prompts the question: should I adopt a Bitcoin HODL strategy? For many, the answer is a resounding yes, provided they understand its nuances and have the right mindset. HODLing, a deliberate misspelling of ‘hold,’ signifies a strategy of buying and holding Bitcoin for extended periods, regardless of short-term price fluctuations. Benefits of HODLing: Compounding Gains: Over long periods, Bitcoin’s historical performance suggests significant potential for compounding returns, far outweighing short-term trading gains for many. Reduced Stress: HODLing eliminates the constant stress of day trading, market timing, and emotional decision-making driven by volatility. Lower Transaction Costs: Fewer trades mean fewer fees, maximizing your capital. Alignment with Fundamentals: It allows you to invest based on Bitcoin’s core value proposition rather than fleeting market sentiment. Challenges of HODLing: Patience is Key: You must be prepared to weather significant bear markets and periods of stagnation. Psychological Resilience: Seeing your portfolio drop by 50% or more requires immense mental fortitude to avoid panic selling. Opportunity Cost: While holding, you might miss out on other short-term opportunities, though this is often offset by long-term gains. For those considering this path, actionable insights include dollar-cost averaging (DCA) – investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price – and only investing capital you can afford to lose. Research, conviction, and a long-term perspective are your best allies. The Enduring Power of Conviction The remarkable Bitcoin accumulation by long-term holders in July 2023 serves as a powerful testament to the enduring belief in Bitcoin’s future. While the broader market may grapple with uncertainty and mixed signals, a significant segment of the investor base is doubling down on their conviction, viewing dips as opportunities rather than threats. This unwavering commitment not only strengthens Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition but also sets the stage for its potential long-term growth. It’s a reminder that in the volatile world of crypto, sometimes the most strategic move is simply to hold, and even better, to accumulate.
