2025-07-16T15:57:25,"Bitcoin and Ethereum Brace for Regulatory Shifts: How Will It Shape the Next Rally?","Bitcoin and Ethereum stand on the brink of significant regulatory changes. These adjustments could impact the entire cryptocurrency landscape. Which digital coins are positioned to thrive amidst these shifts? The article delves into the potential consequences and identifies the cryptocurrencies ready for a new wave of growth. This review is powered by Outset PR , a crypto-native public relations agency. It leverages data, trend insights, and market dynamics to transform fleeting opportunities into sustained visibility and long-term growth for Web3 leaders. Bitcoin Shows Positive Momentum with Upward Growth Potential Source: tradingview Bitcoin's price is currently moving between the low 111,000s to the high 122,000s, indicating a recent upward trend. Over the past week, Bitcoin has increased by over 8%, while the past month saw an upward shift of about 11%. In the last six months, it gained over 17%. The nearest resistance stands around 126,000, and if surpassed, it could aim for the upper 137,000s. This suggests room for substantial growth from today's levels. Investors are eyeing whether Bitcoin can break through these resistance points, which could drive the price higher. Monitoring support levels near 103,000 and 92,000 could also offer insights into potential pullbacks. Ethereum Eyes Growth with Recent Price Surge Source: tradingview Ethereum is showing promising movement in its current price range of just over two and a half thousand to over three thousand dollars. Recently, Ethereum's price has jumped by more than 18% in the past week alone. This could signal good news for investors. If it keeps climbing, it may face some challenges around the nearest resistance level, about ten percent higher than the current top range. But should it break through this point, the second resistance suggests the potential to rally much further, reaching nearly 23% from the present level. While it has dipped in the past months, this positive momentum hints that Ethereum could be bouncing back.

2025-07-16T15:49:30,"Top 5 Countries Leading Crypto Adoption in 2025","As the crypto market continues its global expansion, 2025 has seen a remarkable surge in both institutional and grassroots adoption across emerging economies. While tech-savvy populations and economic instability drive adoption in some regions, others are strategically integrating digital assets into national development plans. This global shift offers massive opportunity, but also raises a critical challenge for crypto founders: how to gain visibility and trust in different markets. That’s where Outset PR plays a pivotal role. This review explores the top five countries leading the charge in crypto adoption this year: India, Bhutan, El Salvador, Nigeria, and Vietnam. India: The Retail Adoption Giant India continues to dominate global rankings with the largest number of cryptocurrency users—over 100 million, according to estimates by Triple-A . Despite regulatory ambiguity, Indian users have embraced crypto for investments, remittances, and participation in DeFi ecosystems. 🔹 Key Drivers: A rapidly digitizing economy with high mobile and internet penetration A booming startup and blockchain developer ecosystem Popular platforms like WazirX and CoinDCX providing local onramps 🔹 Use Cases: Retail investing and trading International remittances from the Indian diaspora NFT and gaming markets gaining traction among Gen Z 🔹 Challenges: Heavy taxation (30% on crypto gains) and lack of a dedicated regulatory framework may limit future growth if not addressed. Bottom Line: India’s crypto momentum is grassroots-led, massive in scale, and largely resilient to policy turbulence. Bhutan: The Sustainable Sovereign Crypto Model Bhutan is the quiet powerhouse in 2025’s crypto landscape, turning heads with its green Bitcoin mining, sovereign holdings, and national merchant adoption. Backed by abundant hydropower, the country has built a reputation for sustainable mining and forward-thinking digital asset policy. 🔹 Key Drivers: Over $1 billion in Bitcoin reserves held by Druk Holdings National strategy to integrate BTC, ETH, and BNB into the treasury Partnership with Binance Pay enabling crypto payments across 1,000+ merchants 🔹 Use Cases: State mining operations using renewable energy Tourism and retail payments in crypto Institutional investment and diversification 🔹 Innovations: The Gelephu Mindfulness City project integrates blockchain, green tech, and digital assets as part of a sustainable economic future. Bottom Line: Bhutan exemplifies a nation-state crypto model blending ecological sustainability with digital finance leadership. El Salvador: The Legal Tender Pioneer In 2021, El Salvador made history as the first country to declare Bitcoin legal tender. While the initial push was met with global scrutiny, 2025 reveals a more balanced approach—with BTC still central to national reserves but no longer mandatory for merchants. 🔹 Key Drivers: Sovereign Bitcoin holdings exceed 6,000 BTC, now worth over $300M–600M Educational campaigns, Bitcoin bonds, and the ""Bitcoin City"" development project Legal infrastructure created by the Bitcoin Law 🔹 Challenges: Low public adoption: Less than 2% of the population actively uses Bitcoin Minimal impact on remittance flows and financial inclusion despite state efforts 🔹 Adjustments: The government softened legal tender mandates in 2025 to align with IMF guidance, focusing on voluntary usage and infrastructure. Bottom Line: El Salvador’s Bitcoin journey remains symbolically and geopolitically significant, though grassroots adoption is limited. Nigeria: Crypto for Financial Survival Nigeria ranks among the top countries for grassroots crypto adoption, especially in peer-to-peer (P2P) trading. With chronic inflation, unstable fiat currency (the Naira), and a young, tech-adept population, crypto has become a financial lifeline. 🔹 Key Drivers: High inflation and limited access to traditional banking Broad adoption of stablecoins like USDT via platforms such as Binance P2P Youth-led digital innovation and freelancing boom 🔹 Use Cases: Daily savings and payments using stablecoins Remittances and cross-border transactions Hedge against local currency devaluation 🔹 Policy Landscape: The Central Bank has shifted from outright bans to regulatory engagement in 2025, signaling a more cooperative approach. Bottom Line: Nigeria showcases real-world crypto utility in response to systemic financial challenges. Vietnam: The Crypto-Gaming Nexus Vietnam continues to impress with a strong mix of grassroots crypto adoption, DeFi engagement, and a booming blockchain gaming sector. From retail investors to developers, Vietnam is a top player in Southeast Asia’s digital economy. 🔹 Key Drivers: Birthplace of Axie Infinity, a pioneer in play-to-earn (P2E) gaming High mobile penetration and youth engagement Fast-growing DeFi ecosystem 🔹 Use Cases: P2E gaming income and NFT trading Crypto savings and trading platforms (e.g., ONUS) Digital remittances among overseas Vietnamese 🔹 Market Dynamics: Despite cautious government oversight, crypto remains a mainstream financial tool in many Vietnamese households. Bottom Line: Vietnam blends tech innovation with financial opportunity, making crypto a vital part of its digital economy. A Multipolar Crypto World The top five countries in 2025 reflect a diverse set of crypto adoption models: Country Adoption Type Distinctive Trait India Mass retail World's largest crypto user base Bhutan Institutional Green mining + merchant adoption El Salvador Legal + symbolic First Bitcoin legal tender, still evolving Nigeria Grassroots survival Crypto as a hedge against inflation Vietnam Hybrid innovation Gaming + DeFi fueling national interest These nations prove that crypto adoption is not one-size-fits-all. Whether driven by necessity, opportunity, or strategy, digital assets are becoming increasingly embedded in national economic fabrics across the globe. As crypto adoption accelerates, the competition for visibility intensifies—new projects, chains, tokens, and protocols emerge daily, all vying for attention in a saturated Web3 landscape. That’s where high-quality public relations comes in—not as an afterthought, but as a core growth lever. Enter Outset PR—the Web3-native agency built for this moment.

2025-07-16T15:39:28,"Altcoin Season Returns? Bitcoin Consolidates With ETH, SUI, SEI Among Those Taking Charge","Bitcoin triumphantly formed a series of fresh record highs last week, eventually topping out just shy of $124,000 as profit taking emerged. The rise has paved the way for what many are describing as the latest ""altcoin season,"" which involves crypto tokens other than bitcoin making often exponential moves to the upside. The recent bitcoin bull market has just been that: a bitcoin bull market with altcoins taking the back seat as institutions rallied around spot bitcoin ETFs and BTC-based treasuries. But there has been a change in behavior this week. Several altcoins have posted gains of between 50% and 80% as capital begins to flow from the world's dominant crypto to more speculative bets. Ether had a good week on the back of a wave of institutional interest, rising by 23.3% compared to bitcoin's 9.3% gain. Other layer-1 blockchains like SEI and SUI also performed well, increasing by 41% and 36%, respectively. Are we in an altcoin season? Altcoin seasons in previous bull markets have been a culmination of euphoria, speculative and viral moves often led by crypto influencers and celebrities. This time around it appears more precise and surgical, altcoins tied to projects with a lot of activity like SUI are the tokens moving. The data is also showing early signs of an altcoin season, CryptoQuant's MRVR-based altcoin season indicator has ticked into altcoin season for consecutive weeks for the first time since June 2024, indicating a shift in momentum. MVRV shows the market value's relative position to BTC and ETH, during previous bullish cycles the indicator was in an altcoin season for months at a time. Furthermore, the meme coin dominance chart has been on a significant downtrend since the turn of the year after botched meme coins issued by U.S. President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump. The shift away from meme coins suggest that the this period of the cycle may be categorized by tokens tied to projects with merit rising as opposed to speculative high and euphoria. CoinDesk's CD20 index has also outperformed the CD5 index , the latter of which just considers BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL and ADA while the CD20 includes more altcoins, further demonstrating a transition into a bullish market for altcoins. CoinMarketCap's altcoin season barometer has also ticked up to 36 out of 100, a level seen just once in the past 90 days. What happens next The altcoin market is still heavily reliant on BTC. If bitcoin continues to consolidate above prior record highs at $112,000, altcoins are primed for a continued move to the upside. However, if bitcoin continues its ascent into unchartered territories, or if it breaks below $112,00, the altcoin market will underperform against BTC. This is because altcoins lack sufficient liquidity to deal with major price swings and if BTC continues to move to the upside, capital will be allocated to chasing that rally while altcoins take a back seat.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/16/is-a-crypto-altcoin-season-here-bitcoin-consolidates-as-alts-take-charge,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ETH","Markets|altcoin|alt season|Bull Market|News",cryptocompare
2025-07-16T15:37:12,"Bitcoin’s Pause Is Ethereum’s Green Light: Here’s What’s Next","Bitcoin’s surge has paused as traders engaged in profit-taking. This triggered a pullback, which dragged the cryptocurrency near $116,000. It has since staged a recovery of nearly 2%, pushing Bitcoin above $119,000 at the time of writing. New data has emerged, signaling that BTC is not at a local top but in a transition phase, with timing, behavior, and structure all pointing to further upside. BTC Makes Room for Alts According to the analytics firm, SwissBlock’s latest market report, ‘Altcoin Vector,’ beneath the surface, capital rotation has started , and Ethereum is emerging as the next leg of the cycle. The firm said that Bitcoin is consolidating , and not breaking down. BTC dominance has likely peaked in the short term as capital rotation accelerates across the crypto market. The ETH/BTC ratio is also rising steadily, which is indicative of Ethereum’s relative strength and its ability to attract liquidity from Bitcoin while also lifting the broader altcoin complex. This is is also driving renewed momentum in other altcoins as liquidity moves within the market rather than exiting it. This trend indicates an expansion phase where capital is redeploying into Ethereum and select altcoins, while simultaneously reducing BTC’s market share. The rotation means that confidence remains intact as investors seek higher returns beyond BTC. BTC Hasn’t Topped Yet While Bitcoin’s pause has triggered rotation into Ethereum and altcoins, SwissBlock argued that the broader cycle for the world’s largest crypto itself remains unfinished. According to BTC Vector’s Optimal Signal, each major expansion in this cycle has lasted 15-30 days, while the current rally is only on day 12. With capital beginning to rotate into Ethereum, it indicates that the cycle remains incomplete. To top that, Glassnode’s Short-Term Holder Relative Unrealized Profit also remains well below levels seen during previous cycle tops in January and April 2024, which means that market participants are not exhibiting excessive profit-taking or euphoria yet. Additionally, both Willy Woo’s Speculation Index and VWAP Liquidity confirm that the market is not overheated, as neither indicator has reached prior cycle extremes. These factors together suggest there is ongoing structural support for Bitcoin to move higher.

Recently, a significant announcement from Canadian fintech firm LQWD has captured the attention of the crypto community: a groundbreaking $10 million At-The-Market (ATM) Program. This move isn’t just about raising capital; it’s a strategic play designed to deepen the company’s commitment to the digital asset space, specifically through increased Bitcoin purchases and robust support for the Lightning Network. Let’s dive into what this means for the future of crypto financing and how LQWD is positioning itself at the forefront of this exciting evolution. Understanding LQWD’s Strategic ATM Program LQWD, a company focused on decentralized finance and the Lightning Network, has unveiled its $10 million ATM Program. This financing vehicle is a common method used by publicly traded companies to raise capital by issuing and selling new common shares directly into the open market at prevailing prices. It offers flexibility and efficiency, allowing companies to tap into liquidity as needed without the complexities and costs associated with traditional underwritten offerings. So, what exactly is an ATM Program and why is it beneficial for a company like LQWD? Flexibility: Unlike a fixed-price offering, an ATM program allows the company to sell shares over a period, adapting to market conditions. Cost-Effective: It typically involves lower fees compared to a traditional public offering. Market-Driven: Shares are sold at market prices, reducing the potential for price dilution often seen with large, sudden issuances. Continuous Capital Access: Provides an ongoing source of funds for strategic initiatives. This approach highlights a growing trend in crypto financing , where companies are finding novel ways to fund their operations and expand their digital asset holdings. LQWD’s decision to utilize an ATM Program signals a mature and measured approach to capital management in the volatile crypto market. Why Are Bitcoin Purchases a Key Focus for LQWD? At the heart of LQWD’s ATM Program lies a clear objective: to facilitate more Bitcoin purchases . Bitcoin, as the original and largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, continues to be seen as a foundational digital asset and a store of value. For a company like LQWD, which is deeply embedded in the Bitcoin ecosystem through its Lightning Network infrastructure, increasing its BTC holdings is a logical and strategic move. There are several compelling reasons why companies are increasingly prioritizing Bitcoin acquisitions: Balance Sheet Strength: Holding Bitcoin can be viewed as a hedge against inflation and a way to diversify corporate treasuries. Alignment with Core Business: For crypto-native companies, holding BTC aligns their financial interests with the success of the broader crypto market. Liquidity for Operations: Bitcoin can be used to fund various operational needs, especially within the crypto space. Strategic Asset: For a company focused on the Lightning Network, owning more Bitcoin provides the necessary liquidity to operate and expand its network nodes. LQWD’s commitment to increasing its Bitcoin reserves demonstrates a strong conviction in the long-term value and utility of the digital asset, reinforcing its position as a key player in the evolving digital economy. How Does This Program Impact the Lightning Network? Beyond direct Bitcoin purchases, a significant portion of the proceeds from LQWD’s ATM Program is earmarked to boost the Lightning Network . For those unfamiliar, the Lightning Network is a ‘layer 2’ payment protocol built on top of Bitcoin. It enables incredibly fast, low-cost, and scalable Bitcoin transactions, addressing some of Bitcoin’s inherent limitations as a medium of exchange. LQWD is a significant operator of Lightning Network nodes, providing crucial infrastructure that allows these rapid transactions to occur. By investing further in this network, LQWD aims to: Aspect Impact of LQWD’s Investment Node Capacity Increased capital allows for more robust and higher-capacity Lightning nodes. Channel Liquidity More Bitcoin enables the creation of larger and more liquid payment channels, improving transaction reliability. Network Reach Expanded infrastructure can lead to broader adoption and accessibility of Lightning payments globally. Transaction Efficiency A stronger network means even faster and cheaper Bitcoin transactions for users. This investment is crucial for the continued growth and mainstream adoption of Bitcoin as a transactional currency. A more robust Lightning Network means a better user experience, paving the way for Bitcoin to be used for everyday purchases, remittances, and micro-transactions worldwide. LQWD’s strategic focus on strengthening this vital layer of the Bitcoin ecosystem is a testament to its vision for a truly scalable digital economy. What Does This Mean for LQWD and Its Investors? For LQWD itself, this $10 million ATM Program represents a significant step in solidifying its financial position and executing its growth strategy. By securing flexible access to capital, the company can proactively pursue opportunities within the Bitcoin and Lightning Network space without being constrained by immediate cash flow needs. For investors, this move could be interpreted in several ways: Confidence in Strategy: The company is demonstrating confidence in its long-term vision for the Lightning Network and Bitcoin. Growth Potential: Increased investment in infrastructure and Bitcoin holdings could lead to enhanced revenue streams and asset appreciation. Market Signal: It sends a strong signal to the market about LQWD’s commitment to expanding its footprint in the digital asset industry. It’s an interesting time for companies operating at the intersection of traditional finance and cutting-edge blockchain technology. LQWD’s ATM Program exemplifies how established financial mechanisms are being adapted to fuel innovation in the rapidly expanding crypto landscape. Conclusion: A Strategic Leap Forward in Crypto Financing LQWD’s launch of a $10 million ATM Program is more than just a fundraising initiative; it’s a strategic declaration of intent. By leveraging this flexible financing vehicle, the Canadian fintech firm is not only securing capital but also directly investing in the foundational pillars of the decentralized economy: Bitcoin and the Lightning Network. This move underscores the growing maturity of the crypto market and the innovative ways companies are approaching capital management to drive adoption and build robust infrastructure. As the crypto space continues to evolve, we can expect to see more such sophisticated financial maneuvers. LQWD’s commitment to strengthening the Lightning Network through strategic Bitcoin purchases is a positive indicator for the broader ecosystem, promising faster, cheaper, and more accessible Bitcoin transactions for everyone. It’s a clear signal that the future of finance is becoming increasingly digital, and companies like LQWD are leading the charge.

On Monday, BTC surged to a new all-time high of $123,200, only to retrace to $115,700 by Tuesday, highlighting the fast-paced, high-stakes environment that has returned to the crypto market. Despite the sharp pullback, the overall trend remains bullish, with price structure and momentum still favoring the bulls. Related Reading: SharpLink Gaming Buys $73M in Ethereum – Smart Money Loads the Dip Bitcoin has held above key support levels, and buyers continue to step in on dips, reinforcing confidence in the ongoing uptrend. The recent move is viewed by many as a healthy correction rather than a reversal, especially given the macro backdrop and rising institutional involvement. Adding to the bullish narrative, CryptoQuant data reveals that retail investors are making a comeback. The 30-day change in demand for small BTC transfers (ranging from $0–$10K) is signaling renewed interest from retail investors. Retail Demand Reawakens As Crypto Week Advances In Washington Top analyst Axel Adler has highlighted a critical on-chain signal that points to the return of retail investors in the Bitcoin market. The 30-day change in demand for small transfer volumes ($0–$10K) has moved out of negative territory for the first time in months. This shift indicates a meaningful increase in activity from smaller holders—widely interpreted as retail participants—after a prolonged period of dormancy. Retail involvement plays a crucial role in sustaining long-term bullish trends. While institutional demand often drives initial breakouts, it is the broad participation from everyday investors that adds momentum and staying power to rallies. The reappearance of retail buying interest not only strengthens Bitcoin’s current price structure but also suggests growing confidence in the asset’s outlook, despite recent volatility. This renewed demand comes at a pivotal time. “Crypto Week” is underway in the US Congress, where lawmakers are actively debating and voting on three major cryptocurrency bills. The outcomes of these discussions are expected to shape the regulatory landscape for years to come and could provide the clarity that both retail and institutional investors have long awaited. For now, the uptick in small-scale BTC transfers is a strong signal. That retail investors are re-engaging just as the crypto industry prepares for potentially historic policy changes.

The recent dip toward $117,000 was met with buyer interest, as seen in the long lower wick and a moderate bounce on rising volume.

Currently at $108,040, $102,116, and $97,362, respectively—all of which are upward sloping. This confirms a strong bullish structure, with momentum still favoring buyers in the medium to long term.

2025-07-16T15:30:09,"JPMorgan Chase Set To Explore Stablecoins, Says CEO Jamie Dimon","In a recent earnings call, Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, expressed skepticism about the appeal of stablecoins but acknowledged that his bank cannot afford to ignore this evolving financial technology. Dimon Embraces Stablecoins Despite Skepticism Last month, JPMorgan announced its intention to launch a limited version of a stablecoin, specifically for its clients. Dimon remarked , “We’re going to be involved in both JPMorgan deposit coin and stablecoins to understand it, to be good at it.” Despite his reservations about their utility compared to traditional payment methods, he recognizes the importance of engaging with this technology. Dimon, known for his vocal opposition to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), leads one of the largest financial institutions in the world, which processes nearly $10 trillion in payments daily. His acknowledgment of stablecoins reflects a strategic pivot at a time when the regulatory environment is becoming more conducive to innovation under President Donald Trump’s second term in the White House. The executive further warned that failing to explore stablecoins could result in losing ground to agile fintech companies that are keen to disrupt traditional banking practices. In fact, JPMorgan’s CEO pointed out the intelligence of fintech competitors, stating, “They’re trying to figure out a way to create bank accounts, to get into payment systems and rewards programs, and we have to be cognizant of that.” Citigroup And Bank Of America Join The Fray Other major banks beyond JPMorgan are also considering their own stablecoin initiatives. Citigroup executives announced they are exploring the issuance of a Citi stablecoin, looking for opportunities in tokenized deposits and cryptocurrency custody services . Similarly, Bank of America’s CEO, Brian Moynihan, indicated that his bank would also participate in the stablecoin space, potentially through collaborations among banks. The concept of banks working together on stablecoin projects is reminiscent of their joint efforts to create Zelle, a platform for instant peer-to-peer payments. However, when questioned about potential collaborations, Dimon was non-committal, stating, “That’s a great question, and we’ll leave it remaining as a question.” Yet, the momentum for stablecoin initiatives faces potential hurdles. Recently, several bills aimed at regulating cryptocurrencies, backed by President Donald Trump, failed to pass a crucial procedural vote in the House of Representatives.

2025-07-16T15:27:09,"Canadian-Based Tech Company Approves Treasury Strategy Aiming to Collect 6,000 Bitcoins! Details Here","Canada-based company Matador Technologies announced that its board of directors has approved a long-term Bitcoin accumulation strategy. Matador Technologies Confirms Treasury Strategy Aiming to Collect 6,000 Bitcoin by 2027 The company's ultimate goal is to reach 6,000 BTC by 2027 and become one of the top 20 institutional Bitcoin holders globally. The company currently holds 77.4 BTC and its equivalent in assets. As part of the new strategy, plans have been created to accumulate 1,000 BTC by 2026 and 6,000 BTC by 2027. The board of directors described these goals as “deterministic but predictive” and emphasized that there is no financial commitment. Matador calculated that if this fund were to be fully acquired in Bitcoin under the current CAD 900 million shelf allowance, approximately 5,934 BTC could be acquired at an average of CAD 151,659. The total is projected to reach approximately 6,011 BTC, including existing assets. This scenario aligns with the company's 2027 target. However, it was noted that these calculations are for illustrative purposes only. The company stated that additional Bitcoin purchases will be subject to various factors, including financing opportunities, market conditions, and regulatory approvals. It also stated that price and timing will be considered, with the goal of maximizing Bitcoin (BPS) value per share. Matador will operate with the goal of maintaining a strong capital structure during this period. There is no guarantee that financing options will be available on favorable terms. This announcement marks Matador's arrival among the firms embracing a digital asset strategy at the institutional level. The company has identified a long-term vision of acquiring a 1% stake in the Bitcoin supply, a move that further solidifies institutional interest in the sector. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-16T15:23:01,"Cantor Equity Partners 1 Gains 25% on $3.5B Bitcoin Deal With Adam Back","Cantor Equity Partners I (CEPO) is changing hands just shy of $15 in morning U.S. action, up about 25% from the $12 level it traded at prior to a late-Tuesday story from the FT that the company and Adam Back were nearing a $3.5 billion funding deal. To review, CEPO is the blank check bitcoin treasury company headed by Brandon Lutnick — chairman of Wall Street investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald and son of Trump administration Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. According to the FT report , Cantor Equity Partners 1 would acquire 30,000 BTC (nearly $3.5 billion at current prices) from Back. In return, Back would receive equity in the vehicle, which would be renamed BSTR Holdings. CEPO is also seeking to raise another $800 million of additional capital to acquire even more BTC, the report said. Back cashing out? Cynics might believe that the move signals a desire by Back — one of Bitcoin's OGs whose cryptography work was used by the network's creator Satoshi Nakamoto — to cash in on some of his vast BTC holdings. This couldn't be further from the truth, according to CoinDesk Senior Analyst James Van Straten. ""Far from being a mere liquidity event for Back, this partnership underscores his long-term conviction that Bitcoin should become a core asset class in traditional finance portfolios,"" said Van Straten. ""Rather than cashing out, Back seems intent on leveraging institutional vehicles to push Bitcoin further into the financial mainstream, bridging the gap between btc-native innovation and Wall Street capital."" Van Straten further noted that Back has invested his own cash in the funding of other bitcoin treasury strategy companies. ""This deal reinforces the notion that Back’s priorities lie in expanding Bitcoin’s institutional use cases, not simply realizing gains on his holdings,"" he concluded.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/16/cantor-equity-partners-1-gains-25-on-35b-bitcoin-deal-with-adam-back,"BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TREASURY|BUSINESS","Markets|Adam Back|Bitcoin|Cantor fitzgerald|News",cryptocompare

2025-07-16T15:15:45,"Tether eyes LATAM commodity trade with strategic $600M Adecoagro acquisition","Tether, the largest digital asset company and USDT issuer globally, signals a significant entry into the Latin American commodity markets with the $600 million purchase of a controlling stake in regional agribusiness leader Adecoagro. According to Reuters, the agreement announced in March awarded Tether approximately 70% of Adecoagro. The New York-listed company makes dairy in Argentina, sugar and rice in Brazil, and ethanol in Uruguay. The acquisition will allow Tether to deepen its US dollar-pegged stablecoin into the multi-trillion-dollar global commodities trade, beginning with agricultural and energy exports in South America, the company said. Bringing stablecoins into the real economy Tether’s USDT token, introduced in 2014, is intended to track the US dollar and is frequently used in cryptocurrency markets as a reliable store of value. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, USDT is primarily supported by US Treasury bonds. Tether reported $149 billion in reserves and $143 billion in issued USDT in its first-quarter 2025 report, with $120 trillion in Treasuries. The company now intends to employ USDT for cross-border payments in traditional industries, rather than just cryptocurrency exchanges. “Tether seeks to increase the use of its stablecoin for cross-border payments. “I believe this will grow significantly in the financial markets, particularly in commodities markets,” said Marcos Viriato, CEO of Parfin, a South American fintech that provides infrastructure for cryptocurrency transactions. Parfin is cooperating with Banco Bradesco, Brazil’s third-largest bank, on a trial program that allows exporters to receive payments in USDT. The stablecoin is converted into local currency and placed into firm accounts, lowering expenses and shortening transaction times from many days to mere seconds. Crypto meets commodity production The acquisition of Adecoagro is part of a larger trend where crypto firms have been making investments in physical assets. Joe Sticco, CEO of Cryptex Finance, commented that Tether earns a steady income from businesses such as farmland and processing plants, making investments that complement the balance sheet of the crypto-oriented company and protect against inflation. For Tether, the plan is two-pronged: fortify its financial base and get as much real-life usage of USDT as possible. It is cooperating with Adecoagro management, as well as agricultural experts, to potentially leverage stablecoins in commodity transactions and increase liquidity and efficiency in trading. This is not an untried concept for the company. Tether paid for a crude oil transaction between a large energy producer and a commodities broker with USDT in late 2024, a first for such an agreement to be fully settled in a stablecoin. As geopolitical developments occur, such use cases gain traction. According to reports, Russia and Venezuela have used cryptocurrency to enable oil deals with countries such as China and India, so bypassing Western financial sanctions. Tokenising Latin America’s harvest While Tether has not announced any concrete intentions, industry experts believe the business would eventually tokenise agricultural items. Gracy Chen, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Bitget, stated that, similar to Tether’s gold-backed token, the company may explore digital tokens for commodities such as corn or sugar. These could be used as collateral for pre-harvest finance or as hedging tools for producers. “In effect, they’re turning farmland and sugar mills into programmable instruments of finance,” Chen told me. Tether acknowledged the possibility of tokenising actual assets such as agricultural commodities, but stated that there are no imminent plans to release such tokens. Renewables and Bitcoin mining Meanwhile, Adecoagro’s renewable energy assets have already been put to use. Tether has revealed that a portion of its bitcoin mining activities would be powered by electricity supplied by Adecoagro’s sugarcane-based mills in South America. The move is consistent with Tether’s objective of integrating real-world infrastructure to serve its cryptocurrency ecosystem. Tether is establishing its stablecoin as a major instrument in global trade by deepening its involvement in Latin America’s agricultural and energy economies.

The company argues that the architecture of Ethereum is evolving beyond a smart contract platform into the foundation for programmable, verifiable trust in financial systems. This shift, it argues, could eventually push the price of Ether (ETH) to $15,800 by 2028. Trustware: Ethereum’s Next Identity Trust is the underpinning of the economy — from banks to justice systems — and Consensys estimates that over $9.3 trillion is spent annually on trust infrastructure. Yet, Ethereum, through its decentralized and transparent code, suggests a digital alternative: trustware. Trustware is a new way of talking about the incredible value that Ethereum is already bringing to the economy,” said Jason Linehan, chief strategy officer at Consensys. In his view, Ethereum has become a programmable alternative to conventional intermediaries. Cost-to-Corrupt: A New Valuation Model At the heart of Consensys’ ETH bull thesis is the “cost-to-corrupt” framework. The framework ties Ethereum’s market capitalization to the security it provides to onchain value like stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets. Given growth in these asset categories — $1T in stablecoins, $500B in tokenized RWAs, and $300B in DeFi TVL by 2028 — ETH would reach $15,800. Linehan characterizes these projections as conservative, with some estimates significantly higher. Ethereum’s First Mover Advantage and Market Opportunity Despite competition, Ethereum is still securing $220B of High-Quality Liquid Assets, compared to Solana’s $20.3B and Avalanche’s $3.7B. Moreover, the entire crypto market is only 0.3% of global wealth, with plenty of room for adoption. Consensys believes the next era will be one of “agentic finance” — global scale finance managed by sophisticated algorithms, with Ethereum at its core. A Decade of Innovation and Institutional Readiness Ethereum’s architecture has been shaped by 21 network upgrades and a series of innovations — from smart contracts and DeFi to proof-of-stake and real-world assets tokenized. With over 1 million validators in 84 countries, it is a mainstay of decentralization and security. As trustware becomes the critical infrastructure for global finance, Consensys thinks Ethereum is poised to capture trillions of value — and ETH holders are just beginning.",btcpulse,https://btc-pulse.com/ethereums-trustware-vision-could-propel-eth-to-15-8k-by-2028-consensys/,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN","Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-07-16T15:01:58,"Bitcoin Has Entered Its Subprime Asset Bubble Phase","Summary Bitcoin's recent rise is driven by speculation and subprime financing, not genuine innovation or adoption, making the rally fragile and risky. Bitcoin ETFs have enabled Wall Street to dominate the asset, undermining its original promise of financial freedom and direct ownership. The current market resembles a 'subprime era' for digital assets, with financial engineering and overleveraged speculation reminiscent of past financial crises. Retail investors are fueling a historic buying spree, but this could end badly as market vulnerabilities and global economic risks mount. While my December short article on Bitcoin led to a drop of around -40%, my latest in March has seen those gains eroded. However, in this article, I will explain why BTC is rising on speculation and a new subprime era of 200+ BTC treasury firms and financial engineering, rather than any new developments. I will also explain how investors buying Bitcoin may be forced to ""own nothing and be happy"". The Bitcoin freedom paradox I warned investors in January 2024 on the release of the Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) that the ""Wall Street Takeover"" was now complete. With the funds being backed by physical coins, it meant that any ETF purchases would mean that funds like BlackRock have to take custody of the physical coins. That is the first iteration of owning nothing and being happy because investors are buying up paper assets for speculative gains and have no right to the actual blockchain version. BlackRock is now the second-largest holder of Bitcoin behind the account attributed to Satoshi Nakamoto, with 700,000 BTC. The real paradox, as I mentioned in previous articles, is that Bitcoin was meant to be a tool for financial freedom. Enthusiasts love to bash fiat currency and talk of sound money, but the sector is now almost completely controlled by a handful of Wall Street-friendly ETF providers and corporations. A well-known phrase over the last years has been the ""You'll Own Nothing and Be Happy"" mantra. This was attributed to the World Economic Forum based on an essay they published, and also to Covid-era videos they released to map out a post-2030 world reliant on the sharing economy. It should not be lost on BTC investors that BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has had close ties to the economic group over the years, including being the group's trustee . What could usher in an era of ""owning nothing"", more than the largest retail stock buying spree in the history of mankind, alongside huge investment flows into thousands of digital tokens with no real-world value? Instead of buying tangible assets, investors are piling into tech stocks and the digital ecosystem, which are both overvalued in my opinion. Bitcoin enters its subprime era Not only has Bitcoin been taken over by Wall Street, but its arrival has now ushered in the digital asset's subprime era. The housing crisis in 2007 showed the likely end goal of tangible assets that are owned and leveraged by hedge funds and investment banks. As large ETF providers and investment managers enter the industry, sophisticated financial engineering in Bitcoin has begun. Short-selling hedge fund guru Jim Chanos has been vocally critical of Strategy ( MSTR ) stock's founder, Michael Saylor, for his current balance sheet maneuvers. Talking on a Bloomberg podcast , Chanos talked of the risk in the company's valuation and the fact that investors are happy to pay for shares that cost almost double the Net Asset Value of the company's BTC holdings. It was stated in the podcast that there are now over 200 ""copycat"" companies replicating this strategy. But cheap debt is only possible as BTC is rising, and in the next downturn, stocks will have to be diluted, and quarterly earnings driven by coin appreciation will disappear. Saylor referred to his new approach as ""intelligent leverage"", where the company has issued more than $6bn in convertible bonds solely to purchase BTC. On the other side of that trade are arbitrageurs, who may short the stock or apply options strategies to lock in some extra premium. All of this is hugely disconnected from the original use case of BTC. Chanos decided to short Strategy, but to hedge it with the physical Bitcoin, which is the opposite of what investors are doing now. He also previously referred to the coin as a “libertarian fantasy.” He stated that if the fiat currency system crashed, he wouldn't want Bitcoin. “Food would work the best,” he said. The curious case of founders and whales The other huge red flag in Bitcoin is the story of its supposed founder, Satoshi Nakamoto. Nakamoto is said to be the largest holder of BTC with 1.2 million coins and disappeared in 2011. Nakamoto emailed a colleague to say he had “moved on to other things” and was never heard of again. His current stash of coins remains untouched and would be worth up to $100 billion in today's prices. Investors can believe that story if they want, but in my view, it is a fantasy. Interestingly enough, we saw movement in some other 2011 Bitcoin holdings that had been untouched. It takes a very patient investor with no material desires to sit on a 14 million percent price hike, but that's the next tale. Data from the blockchain showed that three addresses originating from the same owner shifted 23,377 BTC last week. This is the first activity in the coin since April 2011, when BTC traded at $0.78. Analysts are saying that the move is based on security upgrades, but the timing seems strange, in my opinion. More on that speculation In my December short article, I noted the current setup of the ""Buffett Indicator"", which appears to be arriving right on time for a 2,000-style market top. I also noted it in a February short article on tech stocks, ahead of the market's collapse. That dump into April should have been a warning to investors of the market's fragility, but we are now seeing another push higher, with retail investors buying the dip. In the first half of 2025, retail investors traded a record $6.6 trillion in stocks. The cumulative flow of retail money into ETFs and single stocks was estimated at $137.6 billion to $155.3 billion. Meanwhile, in a recent investor survey , 70% of participants believe that markets will be higher in twelve months and are cutting back on other spending habits to invest in the markets. I believe we are watching one of the largest wealth transfers in world history, which could end very badly for small investors. Possible steps to owning nothing As we saw from February to April, the market rally is technically vulnerable to bad news. That was a mild tariff dispute that has since been remedied with very little damage to the global economy, but many storm clouds are looming in government spending and debt. The U.S. debt is ballooning, but President Trump's huge spending bill is set to delay any near-term issues. However, we have seen cracks in the Japanese bond market, while countries such as the United Kingdom are undergoing fiscal chaos . Like the subprime crisis in 2007, or the tech market rally that was halted by the Russia/Ukraine conflict, I believe that we are only a few bad headlines away from another severe downturn. As we saw in 2021-22, Bitcoin is following the Nasdaq almost perfectly and will follow tech stocks down again in a downturn. In my opinion, investors paying for leveraged coins at these levels could see their investments crushed in Bitcoin treasury companies, and ETF flows could grind to a halt, with the majority of late investors underwater. At that point, nothing is off the table, and in the right crisis, the release of a government-approved USD stablecoin could arrive, allowing you to transfer your beaten-down crypto into a safe USD asset at a fraction of its previous worth. At that point, “You Will Own Nothing and You Will Be Happy.” This may not be far away, as President Trump's GENIUS Act has set the stage for stablecoin regulation in the United States, where banks can issue a digital dollar. Federal Reserve policymakers are also touting stablecoins as being ""good for competition"". The market is moving into an all-time high ahead of the so-called ""crypto week"" in Congress, and history may mark that as an important turning point. Risks to the short thesis The obvious risk at the moment is that I believe we are at the tail end of a speculative move that continues higher while stocks remain elevated. We also have the fact that there is limited selling appetite and a retail thirst for ETF investments, alongside the growing investment flows from the BTC treasury companies. I would be a short-term speculator of BTC, but I believe long-term holders will be punished. Conclusion Investors should know how the game ends when an anonymous account and a handful of large Wall Street investment firms now control Bitcoin. Worse still, we are now entering the subprime phase, where Bitcoin treasury companies are leveraging their balance sheet to purchase the digital currency in the belief that it can only go higher. That was the prevailing belief on the housing market in 2007. Adding to the subprime-era connection, we are seeing record levels of retail investor interest, and everyday consumerism is being shunned to buy into this rally at record highs. Unfortunately, many investors in this game may be left owning nothing, whether they have physical or paper assets.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4801628-bitcoin-has-entered-its-subprime-asset-bubble-phase?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","BTC-USD|MSTR",cryptocompare
2025-07-16T14:59:15,"Jim Chanos Calls Strategy’s Premium 'Financial Gibberish'","Disclaimer: The analyst who wrote this article owns shares in Strategy. Jim Chanos , the founder of Kynikos Associates who famously shorted U.S. energy giant Enron before it collapsed in 2001, has set his sights on Strategy (MSTR), arguing the bitcoin (BTC)-buying company’s premium valuation over its holdings of the largest cryptocurrency is unjustified. Chanos has placed a bet against Strategy’s stock by shorting it while maintaining a long position in bitcoin itself, aiming to profit if the company’s premium valuation shrinks. In shorting, a trader borrows stock, sells it and hopes the price falls enough for them to buy it back in time to return to the lender while leaving them with a profit. The investor has earned a reputation for spotting corporate frauds and overvalued companies. Enron, once a major U.S. energy firm, collapsed amid massive accounting fraud , wiping out billions in value and sending top executives to prison, becoming a lasting symbol of corporate scandal. He criticized the financial maneuvers of Strategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, who has sold convertible debt and preferred shares to raise money to buy more bitcoin, calling them “financial gibberish” and warning that the sales create risks for shareholders. Strategy has accumulated more than 600,000 bitcoins , far surpassing its closest competitors. In a debate on the We Study Billionaires podcast , Chanos clashed with Pierre Rochard , CEO of Bitcoin Bond Co. and a well-known bitcoin advocate, over Strategy's roughly 1.9 times net asset value premium. According to Chanos, the company offers nothing unique beyond owning bitcoin, and contends the premium should disappear as more than 140 other firms worldwide, including MARA Holdings (MARA), Riot Platforms (RIOT) and Metaplanet (3350), pursue similar treasury strategies. Rochard, however, sees Strategy’s large bitcoin stash and first-mover advantage as key strengths. He argued the company can raise significant debt without diluting shareholders and that investors view Strategy as a leveraged play on BTC, akin to holding a call option for potential upside.

2025-07-16T14:56:57,"Swedish Refine Group Launches $1M Bitcoin Treasury Strategy","Swedish digital commerce company Refine Group AB has launched a Bitcoin treasury strategy backed by $1 million in fresh capital. The Stockholm-based company raised 10 million Swedish krona through a directed share issue to fund its initial Bitcoin purchases, establishing a new Digital Assets business area alongside its existing Products and Digital Services divisions. Refine’s board of directors resolved to issue 54.37 million shares at 0.1839 krona per share, representing a 20% discount to the seven-day volume-weighted average price of 0.2299 krona, according to the company’s official press release . The company joins other publicly-traded firms that have adopted Bitcoin treasury strategies, including MicroStrategy and Japan’s Metaplanet . Source: Refine Group Strategic Positioning and Capital Structure Refine Group’s treasury strategy centers on accumulating Bitcoin as a core reserve asset while maintaining focus on its traditional digital commerce operations. The company introduced a new performance metric, “Bitcoin per Share,” to track its ability to create long-term shareholder value through strategic Bitcoin accumulation. Chief Executive Officer David Wallinder emphasized the strategic rationale behind the decision, stating that “Bitcoin’s scarcity and global liquidity make it a powerful complement to traditional cash management, and we look forward to continuing expanding this business area.” The directed share issue attracted significant interest from both new strategic investors and existing shareholders, with all shares in the offering fully subscribed. Caldas Capital, led by entrepreneur João Caldas, emerged as the largest participant in the funding round and is set to become Refine’s largest shareholder following the transaction. Caldas brings substantial experience in both traditional business and cryptocurrency markets, having previously founded and sold cosmetics manufacturer Fancy Stage to Humble Group for approximately 550 million krona. His involvement includes both strategic capital and financial expertise, with existing shareholders representing 20% of the company already expressing intentions to propose his appointment to the board of directors. The share issuance will increase Refine’s outstanding shares from 67.5 million to 121.9 million, resulting in approximately 45% dilution for existing shareholders. The company’s share capital will rise from 6.75 million krona to 12.19 million krona following completion of the transaction. Growing European Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Refine Group’s Bitcoin adoption is part of a broader institutional acceptance of cryptocurrency treasury strategies across Europe, particularly in Nordic markets where regulatory frameworks have shown relative clarity. The company joins H100 Group , which became Sweden’s first publicly listed Bitcoin treasury firm in May 2025 after acquiring 4.39 BTC, worth approximately $475,000. This corporate adoption trend coincides with political developments in Sweden, where lawmakers have urged the government to explore establishing a national Bitcoin reserve . Swedish MP Rickard Nordin has introduced a motion to add Bitcoin Reserve to Sweden’s national holdings, citing economic uncertainty and the need for fiscal diversification. #CryptoRegulation #BitcoinReserve https://t.co/anQdwjNVrO — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 11, 2025 Members of Parliament Dennis Dioukarev and Rickard Nordin submitted letters to Finance Minister Elisabeth Svantesson in April, proposing that Sweden begin accumulating Bitcoin through direct policy or budget-neutral methods such as retaining seized cryptocurrency assets. The Nordic momentum extends beyond Sweden, with nine UK-listed companies announcing Bitcoin treasury plans in recent weeks alone. These developments suggest growing corporate confidence in Bitcoin’s role as a digital store of value, even as traditional financial institutions remain cautious about their exposure to cryptocurrency. The trend extends beyond Europe, with companies like France’s Blockchain Group raising $7.7 million for Bitcoin treasury expansion and targeting 260,000 BTC by 2033. Meanwhile, Asian companies, such as Japan’s Metaplanet, and global technology firms are increasingly viewing Bitcoin as a hedge against currency devaluation and inflation. Countries, governments, and institutions are increasingly adopting Bitcoin as a treasury, and the corporate adoption of Bitcoin treasury strategies will likely accelerate further, especially during the current rally.

2025-07-16T14:55:10,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Rebounds After Tuesday Decline, Reclaims $118,000","Bitcoin (BTC) has recovered after a substantial decline on Tuesday, when it plunged to a low of $115,701 before settling at $117,682. The flagship cryptocurrency is up almost 1% during the current session, trading around $118,447. Despite Tuesday’s decline, analysts believe it is unlikely for BTC to see a prolonged correction in the near term. Cantor Fitzgerald Closes In On Deal With Early Bitcoin Supporter Brandon Lutnick, Chair of Cantor Fitzgerald and son of US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, is closing in on a $4 billion deal with an early Bitcoin supporter to buy billions worth of BTC using a blank cheque vehicle backed by Cantor Fitzgerald. Cantor Equity Partners 1, a black cheque vehicle that raised over $200 million in an initial public offering, is in late-stage talks with Adam Beck, founder of Blockstream Capital, to buy $3 billion in Bitcoin. The deal mirrors a deal Brandon struck with SoftBank and Tether in April, advancing Cantor Fitzgerald’s strategy of using publicly-listed shell companies to buy Bitcoin. The deal could see Beck contribute 30,000 BTC to Cantor Equity Partners 1, worth over $3 billion, part of a broader deal with the blank cheque company to raise as much as $800 million in outside capital to fund future Bitcoin purchases. Beck and Blockstream would contribute their holdings in exchange for shares in the Cantor vehicle. According to sources, a deal could be concluded as early as this week. The deal will make Cantor one of the world’s largest and most active Bitcoin buyers, using blank cheque vehicles led by Brandon, who was named chair after his father, Howard Lutnick, joined the Trump administration. Crypto Spot Trading Down Despite Bitcoin Rally Crypto spot trading fell 22% in Q2 2025, extending its decline despite ongoing bullish sentiment. Crypto spot trading fell from $5.3 trillion in Q4 2024 to $4.6 trillion in Q1 2025. Spot crypto trading volumes on major centralized exchanges fell even further, dropping to $3.6 trillion in Q2, according to data from crypto analytics platform TokenInsight. The downturn in spot market trading comes amid a decline in altcoin trading activity and liquidity in Q2, contrasting with the resilience in the derivatives market. “Traders maintained their Q1 preference for high-frequency derivatives trading amid market uncertainty, aiming to hedge risks and leverage volatility.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) ended the weekend on a bullish note, registering an increase of nearly 2% and settling at $118,624. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as the price surged to an intraday high of $123,091 before declining and settling at $119,714. Selling pressure returned on Tuesday as traders locked in their profits after the flagship cryptocurrency surged to record levels. As a result, BTC fell to an intraday low of $115,701 before settling at $117,682. Despite Monday’s substantial drop, analysts don’t believe Bitcoin will enter a downtrend anytime soon. According to analysts from 21Shares, robust fundamentals are supporting the cryptocurrency’s current trajectory. “The structural imbalance between surging demand and a rapidly vanishing supply base makes a prolonged correction increasingly unlikely. There are far more positives than negatives right now.” According to Matt Mena, the current rally is being driven by spot Bitcoin ETFs and Bitcoin treasury companies, with retail demand almost absent. “US-listed Bitcoin ETFs have already absorbed several multiples of the BTC that will be mined this year. That doesn’t even include corporate treasury buyers, who continue to add quietly in the background.” While Mena believes BTC’s bullish trajectory will continue, he cautioned that a reversal cannot be ruled out due to macroeconomic factors. “It is certainly possible that Bitcoin consolidates, or even sees a pullback. If Trump’s proposed tariffs end up being more severe than markets currently anticipate, or if Powell signals that rate cuts are further off than expected, we could see risk assets broadly reprice lower, including Bitcoin.” BTC crossed $110,000 on Thursday (July 3) but lost momentum after reaching this level and fell 1.41% to $108,097 on Friday. The price recovered over the weekend, rising 0.19% on Saturday and nearly 1% on Sunday to settle at $109,231. Despite the positive weekend, BTC was back in the red on Monday, dropping almost 1% to 108,273. It recovered on Tuesday, rising 0.62% and settling at $108,942. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as the price rose over 2% to cross $111,000 and settle at $111,255. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC registered a 3.51% increase and moved to $115,159. Source: TradingView BTC continued pushing higher on Friday, rising 1.50% to cross $116,000 and settle at $116,885. Despite the positive sentiment, the price registered a marginal decline on Saturday. However, it recovered on Sunday, rising nearly 2% to cross $118,000 and settle at $118,624. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as BTC surged past $120,000 to set a new all-time high of $123,091 before declining and settling at $119,814, ultimately registering an increase of 0.92%. Selling pressure returned on Tuesday as BTC plunged to a low of $115,701 before settling at $117,682. The current session sees BTC up nearly 1%, trading around $118,417.

2025-07-16T14:54:09,"Large cap altcoins challenge BTC's dominance","The BTC dominance metric peaked at 63% during the latest rally to new price records. However, the dominance metric slid in the past week, as ETH and top altcoins strengthened. The dominance of BTC peaked above 63%, later declining rapidly as liquidity shifted to ETH. While a full altcoin season is still far from the current price levels, there are signs that selected coins, tokens, and projects are starting to outperform. BTC dominance returned to 61.6% based on Coingecko data, while the altcoin season index is at 36 points, up from 25 points in June. Currently, the index has moved out of the range of a full Bitcoin season, driven by ETH, SOL, and XRP. However, even smaller assets and the meme market are enjoying increased hype. The altcoin season index bounced from a full-on BTC season, as top assets outperformed on a 30-day and 90-day basis. | Source: Coinmarketcap The recent altcoin performance is seen as a potential turning point. In 2025, altcoins did not see a full season where all assets rallied. However, some of the top coins and tokens had periods of decisively outperforming BTC. Large cap altcoins challenge BTC’s dominance One of the main concerns for an altcoin market is that assets from older cycles will never see liquidity allocations again. ETH proved the exception, recently recovering from its lows and showing its key role for DeFi, stablecoin activity, and decentralized trading. For the past month, 42 out of 56 large-cap altcoins outperformed BTC, signaling a potential return to a modified altcoin market. 📈 Crypto Metric of the Day: Altcoin Season Index. Altcoin Season Index just tagged 75 percent – 42 of 56 large‑cap alts beat Bitcoin over the last 30 days. Classic rule says alt season is on when at least 75 percent of the baskets outperform $BTC . 🔍 What it means ⤵️… pic.twitter.com/iS4Spm46Be — IT Tech (@IT_Tech_PL) July 16, 2025 Over the last 90 days, multiple types of assets outperformed BTC. Some of the best performers included meme tokens, especially Pudgy Penguins (PENGU). Several memes also bounced from their lows with robust gains, including SPX, WIF, BONK, and MOG. The other class of outperforming tokens belonged to DeFi and DEX, including HYPE, AAVE, MORPHO, and others. Unlike previous altcoin seasons, this time investors are following several clear trends. Blue chip tokens like ETH, SOL, and XRP, along with several other assets, are closely watched for signs of ETF launches. Even coins from older bull seasons can hope for a recovery in the case of an ETF approval. Assets from older cycles like IOTA and XMR also outperformed BTC on a quarterly basis. Appetite for risk is increasing, showing altcoins are never really abandoned. Altcoin seasons are still short-lived Even with enthusiasm for altcoins, a full season may be short-lived. The expectation for peak valuations and rallies has ranged from 4 to 8 weeks historically. The last full altcoin season happened in 2023, with smaller rallies in between. Altcoins and tokens are also reassessing their strength. As of July 16, most crypto assets remain neutral based on their relative strength index. Few tokens are overbought or oversold. Some, like SUI, SOL, XRP, ARB, and JUP, are showing strength, based on their usage and utility. This time, the altcoin season may take into account real-world applications and usage. Apps and platforms producing significant fees remain preferable, as their tokens are supported by real economic activity. Fewer VC-backed tokens are launching on the market, removing some of the burden of value extraction.

2025-07-16T14:41:09,"Investment Firm Ark Invest Makes Significant Sell-Offs in Both Coinbase Shares and Its Own Spot Bitcoin ETF, ARKB! Details Here","Cathie Wood-led investment firm Ark Invest has seen significant sell-offs in both Coinbase (COIN) shares and its own spot Bitcoin ETF, ARKB. Ark Invest Sells $1 Million in Coinbase Stock and Its Own Bitcoin ETF The company raised approximately $13.3 million by selling 34,207 Coinbase shares and $8.7 million by selling 225,742 ARKB shares. The sales came just after both Bitcoin and Coinbase reached all-time highs. Ark Invest maintains a strategy of not exceeding 10% of any asset weight in its funds. This policy aims to maintain portfolio diversity and involves regular rebalancing in the event of significant increases or decreases in asset value. According to the company's latest data, Coinbase stock makes up 7.9% of the ARKW fund, worth approximately $172.8 million. Robinhood, the fund's largest holding, is 8%, worth $175.5 million. Coinbase shares rose 1.8% to a record $394.01 on Monday, pushing the company's market capitalization past $100 billion for the first time. However, on Tuesday, the shares fell 1.5% to $388.02. In the past month, the shares have gained more than 50%, fueled by Bitcoin's record-breaking rally and the notable IPO of its stablecoin partner, Circle. Ark Also Sells Out of Its Bitcoin ETF Ark Invest also sold $8.7 million of its own spot Bitcoin ETF, ARKB, from the same fund on Tuesday. The sale coincided with Bitcoin's recent breakout above $123,000 on Monday, followed by a drop below $116,000 on Tuesday. ARKB is the fourth largest position, accounting for 7.2% of the ARKW fund and worth approximately $157.2 million. Strong Inflows Continue into Bitcoin ETFs On Tuesday, ARKB saw net outflows of $6.2 million, while spot Bitcoin ETFs saw net inflows of $403.1 million. BlackRock's IBIT ETF led the inflows, contributing $416.3 million. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen inflows for the past nine days, raising a total of $4.4 billion. Since their launch in January 2024, the ETFs have seen total net inflows exceeding $53.3 billion. ARKB accounts for $2.9 billion of this figure and currently manages $5 billion in assets. BRN chief analyst Valentin Fournier made the following statement in his assessment: “ETF inflows are strong, altcoins are gaining momentum, and sentiment is high on macro optimism. Bitcoin has more room to top, but in the short term, we're leaving the stage to altcoins.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-16T14:37:15,"Hackers Exploit BigONE’s Systems, Steal Millions in Bitcoin and Ethereum","Crypto exchange BigONE has reported a security breach involving its hot wallet infrastructure, which resulted in an estimated $27 million loss. The incident was detected by blockchain security platform SlowMist on July 16. Hot Wallet Nightmare SlowMist said that the production network was compromised, and the operating logic of account and risk control-related servers was modified, which allowed the attacker withdraw funds. BigONE confirmed the breach after the exchange’s real-time monitoring system flagged abnormal asset movements and said it was caused by a third-party attack. The exchange, however, stated that all private keys remain secure and the attack path has been identified and contained to prevent further losses. The exchange said that it is working with SlowMist to trace the attacker’s wallet addresses and monitor the movement of the stolen funds, which include 120 BTC, 350 ETH, and over 8 million USDT across four networks. In a statement, BigONE has vowed to cover all user losses using its internal security reserves. The exchange said it aims to ensure that user assets remain intact while it continues investigations. After a temporary suspension, the platform restored its services. BigONE exec Alex Ash stated , “The system upgrade has been successfully completed. Deposit and trading services have now been fully restored, and you may log in via Web or App to resume your transactions. Thank you for your patience and continued support.” On-chain sleuth ZachXBT remarked that he does not sympathize with the exchange, and alleged that it processed significant volumes tied to pig butchering, romance, and investment scams. He added that if more “questionable” offshore exchanges like MEXC or KuCoin were hacked for large sums, it could benefit the crypto industry by acting as a “natural cleanse” without requiring government intervention. GMX Hack The incident comes days after decentralized trading platform GMX was exploited for $42 million. The hacker, however, returned $40.5 million less than 48 hours after the exploit. The penetration vector included a re-entrancy vulnerability in GMX’s V1 smart contracts on July , allowing the perpetrator to manipulate GLP token prices to drain funds. They later bridged them from Arbitrum to Ethereum. GMX offered a 10% white hat bounty in exchange for the stolen assets, which the hacker accepted, keeping a profit of about $4.5 million. GMX confirmed its V2 protocol was not affected by the incident.

2025-07-16T14:30:58,"Analyst Predicts More Rallies for Two of the ‘Strongest’ Memecoins, Hints at More Altcoin Explosions","An analyst who has earned the “Master Trader” rank on the crypto exchange Bybit believes more rallies are in store for two meme assets. Pseudonymous trader Bluntz tells his 324,600 followers on the social media platform X that he thinks the memecoin Pudgy Penguins ( PENGU ) will rise about 66% from current levels before completing a five-wave surge. Bluntz practices the Elliott Wave theory, which states that a bullish asset tends to witness a five-wave rally. Says the trader, “PENGU has been a standout leader over the last week, now looking like it’s in quite an obvious wave three to the upside here on the daily. Anticipate this to test prior all-time highs and potentially beyond over the next month or so. Has insane normie appeal and basically launched in a meme bear market, so it never had a proper price discovery run, but I think its time has come.” Source: Bluntz/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that PENGU will soar to $0.055. At time of writing, PENGU is worth $0.0327. Another memecoin on the trader’s radar is Bonk ( BONK ), which he thinks is following in the footsteps of PENGU. “From all the major memes, BONK and PENGU are two of the strongest that have taken out their major may high resistances already. Fortunately, PENGU is leading and showing the way for BONK over the coming weeks. I am long both of these coins.” Source: Bluntz/X The trader appears to be predicting that BONK will soar to $0.000043. At time of writing, BONK is trading at $0.00003. As for the broader altcoin market, the trader says he’s keeping an eye on the Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) chart, which tracks how much of the crypto market cap belongs to BTC . Bluntz hints that the bearish divergence on the Bitcoin dominance chart is now playing out, suggesting that altcoins are poised to rise faster than BTC in the current bullish environment. A bearish divergence is a signal indicating waning momentum for an asset or index. “BTC.D proper breaking down now, love to see it.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, BTC.D is hovering at 63.73%.

2025-07-16T14:30:09,"Strategy's preferred equity placements are riding a bullish momentum","Strategy (MSTR) revealed a shift in its fundraising, as buyers moved onto its preferred equity placements. The ATM program for STRK, STRF, and STRD saw increased demand, rising to a record during the past week’s fundraising round. The Saylor-led firm noted a shift in its fundraising playbook, as it continues to build up its BTC treasury. After renewing its weekly purchases , Strategy noted that interest in its preferred shares increased. Last week’s market record demand for all three of the preferred stocks shows the firm’s shares are back in the spotlight, extending the BTC purchasing period. Strategy reported that preferred shares contributed $141M to last week’s raise, where the company acquired 4,225 BTC. Our preferred equity ATMs are seeing record demand. $141M raised last week. $STRK $STRF $STRD pic.twitter.com/QVWYbL2161 — Strategy (@Strategy) July 16, 2025 Strategy started to shift its capital raise to preferred shares in the past month. Last week was the first raise to include all types of preferred shares, as STRD offers were finally taken up by the market. Strategy pauses MSTR raises to improve balance Strategy resorted to its preferred shares to slow down the dilution of its MSTR common stock. For the past two weekly raises, the Saylor-led firm did not issue new MSTR shares in its ATM program. Following a two-week pause of new MSTR issues, combined with a record BTC rally, MSTR rose to a yearly high at $442.13. MSTR trades near its yearly peak, after a two-week pause in new share issuance and dilution. | Source: Google Finance The decision helped narrow the gap between the company’s share price and the value of its BTC holdings. When the share price gets too close to the underlying asset value, the ATM sales become less attractive. MSTR sales are successful when presenting a premium and serve as a proxy for BTC investments. As BTC posted records above $122,000 and held around $118,000, Strategy may be able to tap the MSTR ATM program in the coming weeks. As of July, Strategy has used up to 50% of its MSTR ATM program, with allocations intended to last until 2030. The firm has already acquired 3% of the BTC supply, hoping to hold for the long term. Strategy preferred shares get a boost from yield demand Strategy’s preferred shares offer the potential for dividend payouts, satisfying demand for high-yield products. Some of the preferred shares are riskier, but still inspire demand. The three types of preferred equity were issued in January, March, and June, helping Strategy in its record expansion in 2025. STRF remains the least risky preferred stock, with a 10% yield and higher priority compared to STRK and STRD. STRF traded at $117, rising toward a record during the recent fundraise. Recently, STRF peaked at $126.48. STRK offers 8% yield, and is second in seniority in the case of redemption. STRK peaked at $125.75, later sliding to $118.13. The preferred shares have been trading above their $100 par since June, leading Strategy to expand its preferred share offers each week. One of the biggest sources of liquidity will be the $21B sale program for STRK. STRD is the latest addition to preferred shares, currently trading at $93.28. The new facility offers non-mandatory, non-cumulative dividends, though at a higher yield rate compared to STRF and STRK. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-07-16T14:24:46,"Bitcoin, others see gains on Genius Act hopes","Crypto prices jumped Wednesday after President Donald Trump said a vote to approve two long-stalled bills would happen later today. The announcement came less than 24 hours after Republicans in the House blocked progress on both the GENIUS Act and the CLARITY Act, which together would reshape crypto regulation across the United States. Bitcoin, others see gains on Genius Act hopes According to CNBC, several GOP lawmakers reversed their opposition following a late-night White House meeting, clearing the way for what Trump now says will be final votes. Bitcoin climbed 2% to $119,114.79, recovering most of its Tuesday losses. Ether rose 3% to $3,156. The broader market rallied too. Circle rose 5%, and Coinbase added 2% after both closed lower the previous day. Smaller names saw bigger gains. BitMine and SharpLink, two stocks tied to ether treasuries, each gained around 14%. Bit Digital went up 13%. All of them had dipped earlier when the House failed to advance the bills. The GENIUS Act has already passed the Senate. It focuses on stablecoins and would prohibit issuers from paying interest to users. If passed, it would give even more weight to the Ethereum network, which underpins many stablecoin applications used by large institutions. The second bill, the CLARITY Act, deals with broader market structure rules. Unlike the GENIUS Act, it hasn’t yet made it to a vote. Players like Coinbase were pushing for both bills to pass together, but it’s still unclear if that will happen. Owen Lau, an analyst at Oppenheimer, said the market overreacted to Tuesday’s delay. “It’s not such bad news, which is why the stocks [Coinbase and Circle] recovered in late trading,” Owen told CNBC. He added that while prices may stay bumpy until the vote happens, the bills are still expected to pass eventually. “Both stocks may be under pressure until we get the vote, but these bills will eventually get passed after these negotiations.” According to Owen, whether the bills are passed as a pair or separately won’t affect the long-term value much. However, bundling them would give markets quicker clarity by cutting out months of political stalling. Institutions keep pouring in Ether’s rally, though impressive, isn’t backed by much on-chain growth. Markus Thielen, head of research at 10x Research, said the recent surge was driven by hype and positioning. “Active addresses remain flat, network revenue is unchanged, and gas [transaction] fees have only ticked up slightly,” Markus said. Despite those weak fundamentals, ether has doubled in price in just three months, riding on growing stablecoin interest and the buzz around ether treasuries. Bitcoin’s rise hasn’t been smooth either. The coin fell earlier in the week after over $360 million worth of leveraged long positions were liquidated on Monday. That liquidation dragged the price down briefly after Bitcoin hit an all-time high above $120,000. But after Trump’s post, the coin rebounded again. Money keeps flowing in from institutions. On Tuesday, Bitcoin ETFs took in $402.99 million, while ether funds pulled in $192.3 million, showing that big investors are still loading up even as Washington keeps dragging its feet.

2025-07-16T14:17:41,"XRP Ledger Hits 7.18M Wallets as Canada’s Top ETF Surpasses $50M AUM","The XRP Ledger (XRPL) has crossed 7.18 million registered addresses, marking a major adoption milestone. At the same time, Canada’s 3iQ XRP ETF has surged past $50 million in assets under management, signaling growing institutional confidence in the XRP ecosystem. Rising Institutional & Developer Engagement Over the past year, the XRP Ledger has drawn increasing interest from financial institutions and developers. Coinbase's launch of XRP futures and rising volumes on regulated exchanges like the CME Group to the tune of $542 million in the first month have created a robust framework for large-scale adoption. Meanwhile, the XRP ecosystem has expanded as developers launch new payment rails, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, and non-fungible tokens (NFT) marketplaces on XRPL, driving both on‑chain transfers and address registration. Source: CryptoQuant Higher Token Utility & Consumer Awareness The migration of XRP into new use cases, such as cross-border payments, remittances, and even strategic crypto reserves, has fueled public and institutional awareness. Notably, XRP was included alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano in a U.S. national crypto reserve plan announced in early 2025. Such high-profile validation has likely inspired both retail and corporate users to explore XRPL, leading to a growing base of unique addresses. UX Improvements & Wallet Launches There has been a surge of user-friendly wallet apps tailored for XRPL—including mobile, desktop, and embeddable non‑custodial options. This proliferation, along with simplified KYC processes by exchanges and fiat-on-ramp platforms, lowered barriers, helping onboard millions of new users. Demand for XRP ETF Skyrockets in Canada Canada’s largest XRP-focused ETF continues to witness soaring demand with asset under management (AUM) breaching $50 million. Taking on X, formerly Twitter, 3iQ Digital Asset Management, pointed out , “We are proud to announce that our XRP ETF (TSX: XRPQ, XRPQ.U), Canada’s largest XRP ETF, has accumulated over 50 million USD in client assets since its launch on June 18th.” According to Pascal St-Jean, the 3iQ XRP ETF president and CEO, this milestone underscores rising demand for digital assets, as both retail and institutional investors seek smarter allocations. He added that its 0% launch management fee and ETF flexibility stand in sharp contrast to the high premiums of earlier crypto funds, making it a compelling choice for cost-conscious investors. Notably, 3iQ wowed investors by waiving its management fee for the first six months, making XRPQ one of the most competitively priced crypto ETFs in North America. This aggressive pricing lowered the barrier to entry for retail and institutional investors alike. Furthermore, the 3iQ launch capitalized on Canada’s position as a progressive hub for spot crypto ETFs, joining Purpose Investments , which debuted its own XRP vehicle concurrently. Conclusion The impressive AUM milestone not only validates 3iQ’s strategy, but also signals a broader trend, which is a shift toward regulated, cost‑efficient crypto investing. With regulatory skies clearing and institutional legitimacy increasing, the XRP ETF model may soon become a blueprint for future crypto investment vehicles, paving the way for broader adoption far beyond Canada’s borders. Additionally, the combination of institutional engagement, increased transaction volume, new on‑chain products, and active whale movements has created a self-reinforcing loop for the XRP Ledger. As developers continue building new services, especially around payments and tokenized assets, and regulators embrace XRP’s liquidity and utility, both address counts and on‑chain usage are set for further expansion as XRPL and XRP ETFs take center stage.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9955/xrp-ledger-hits-7-18-m-wallets-as-canada-s-top-etf-surpasses-50-m-aum,"XRP|WALLET|BUSINESS|ADA|BTC","News|Ripple",cryptocompare

According to TokenInsight’s latest Exchange Report, total crypto market capitalization climbed to $3.46 trillion by quarter-end, up 28.2% from Q1. However, exchange activity failed to keep pace with the broader recovery, as cautious sentiment, limited altcoin participation, and macroeconomic headwinds dragged down trading volumes. Trading Volume Down Despite Bitcoin Surge TokenInsight reports that the total trading volume across the top 10 crypto exchanges reached $21.6 trillion in Q2, a 6.16% decline from the previous quarter. 1/ The Top 10 exchanges total $21.58T in volume, a decrease of 6.16% compared to the previous quarter. pic.twitter.com/Ue57kdpUP0 — TokenInsight (@TokenInsight) July 16, 2025 While Bitcoin rallied from $83,000 to over $111,000 before closing near $106,000, the rest of the market saw uneven performance. Liquidity remained concentrated in a few large-cap assets, with many altcoins continuing to see low activity and sharp drops in interest. The spot market, in particular, experienced a marked pullback: average daily spot trading volume declined from $51 billion in Q1 to $40 billion in Q2. Total spot volume across major exchanges reached $3.63 trillion, a 21.7% drop quarter-on-quarter. Derivatives trading fared slightly better, reaching $20.2 trillion, down 3.6% from Q1. This segment remained more resilient as traders sought to hedge volatility and manage risk amid ongoing geopolitical tensions and sluggish global growth. The average daily derivatives trading volume fell to $226 billion, compared to $233 billion in Q1, reflecting broader market caution. Binance Leads, But Market Share is Shifting Binance retains its lead in total trading volume with a 35.39% share, though this reflected a slight decrease from Q1. Other exchanges gained ground: OKX, Bitget, HTX, Gate, and KuCoin all expanded their market shares during the quarter. Gate posted the largest gain with a 2.55% increase, followed by OKX with 1.08%. In the open interest market, Binance strengthened its position with a 0.36% increase, reaching a 23.83% share. Bitget, OKX, and HTX also made modest gains. The data shows a gradual diversification in user behavior, as smaller platforms continue to attract more trading volume despite the broader slowdown in market activity. Exchange Tokens Lag Behind Bitcoin Rally While Bitcoin surged 31.62% during Q2, exchange-related tokens underperformed. BNB led the pack with an 8.91% gain, followed by modest increases in OKB, BGB, and KCS. Most other exchange tokens posted declines, reflecting waning interest in altcoin markets. As TokenInsight notes, exchange tokens remain closely correlated with altcoin activity, which saw reduced liquidity and volume during the quarter. With persistent macro uncertainty and uneven regulatory developments , Q3 is expected to remain challenging for exchange token performance. TokenInsight anticipates continued divergence in this segment as market participants focus on high-cap assets and remain selective in deploying capital across the exchange sector.

QCP Capital: Bitcoin Pulled Back After Surpassing $120,000, But Market Still Structurally Strong As summer approaches, a seasonal decrease in trading volume is observed in the cryptocurrency market. Another key point highlighted in the report is the 10% depreciation of the dollar index since the beginning of the year. This paves the way for strong performance in dollar-denominated assets, particularly Bitcoin. QCP Capital also noted that Ethereum has recently outperformed Bitcoin. This strengthening is attributed to institutions like SBET, which have taken steps to diversify its Ethereum-based treasuries, and the increasing trend of other companies to increase their Ethereum holdings. Retreat Can Be a Healthy Correction According to the analysis, a pullback to $110,000 could allow Bitcoin to consolidate more robustly in the current uptrend.

2025-07-16T14:00:20,"Bitcoin DeFi Unlocking: Bitlayer’s BitVM Bridge Revolutionizes BTC Integration","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin DeFi Unlocking: Bitlayer’s BitVM Bridge Revolutionizes BTC Integration Imagine the vast, untapped potential of Bitcoin, the world’s most secure and valuable cryptocurrency, finally flowing freely into the dynamic world of decentralized finance (DeFi). For years, Bitcoin has largely remained an isolated giant, its immense liquidity locked away from the burgeoning DeFi ecosystem. Now, a groundbreaking development is set to change that narrative. Bitlayer, a prominent Bitcoin layer-2 network, has launched its innovative BitVM Bridge on the mainnet, promising to usher in a new era for Bitcoin DeFi . This is not just another bridge; it’s a trust-minimized pathway designed to unlock Bitcoin’s true potential within decentralized applications, ensuring security and efficiency. Are you ready to witness how this pivotal innovation could redefine the future of crypto finance? What is the Significance of Bringing Bitcoin DeFi to the Forefront? For too long, Bitcoin, despite its market dominance, has been underutilized in the DeFi space. Most DeFi protocols reside on blockchains like Ethereum or Solana, which offer smart contract capabilities that Bitcoin’s native blockchain does not. To use BTC in DeFi, users often relied on ‘wrapped’ versions of Bitcoin (like WBTC) or centralized custodians, introducing various levels of trust and potential points of failure. This meant that the security and decentralization inherent to Bitcoin were often compromised when it entered DeFi. The significance of truly integrating Bitcoin DeFi lies in several key areas: Unlocking Liquidity: Bitcoin represents hundreds of billions of dollars in dormant capital. Bringing this liquidity into DeFi can supercharge existing protocols and enable entirely new financial products. Enhanced Security: By leveraging Bitcoin’s foundational security, DeFi applications can potentially become more robust and resilient. Increased Decentralization: Reducing reliance on centralized custodians or multi-signature schemes for bridging promotes a more decentralized financial ecosystem, aligning with the core ethos of crypto. New Use Cases: Imagine Bitcoin being seamlessly used as collateral for loans, participating in liquidity pools, or earning yield in a trust-minimized manner. This opens up a universe of possibilities for innovation. Bitlayer’s BitVM Bridge aims to address these challenges head-on, offering a pathway that respects Bitcoin’s security principles while expanding its utility. How Does the BitVM Bridge Work its Magic? At the heart of Bitlayer’s innovation is the BitVM Bridge , which leverages the powerful, albeit complex, concept of BitVM. BitVM, or Bitcoin Virtual Machine, is a revolutionary proposal that allows for the execution of complex computations on Bitcoin without altering its core protocol. It achieves this by proving that a given computation could have been executed on Bitcoin, even if it wasn’t. This is done through a mechanism known as ‘fraud proofs’. Here’s a simplified breakdown of how the BitVM Bridge operates: Locking BTC: When a user wants to bring their BTC into the Bitlayer ecosystem (or another DeFi platform via the bridge), their Bitcoin is locked in a special multi-signature address on the Bitcoin mainnet. This address is controlled by a set of participants, including the user and a designated ‘challenger’ or ‘verifier’. The Role of BitVM Smart Contracts: The bridge utilizes a BitVM smart contract. This isn’t a smart contract in the Ethereum sense, but rather a way to express and verify complex conditions using Bitcoin’s existing scripting language (Script). Trust-Minimized Security: The core innovation is the ‘trust-minimized’ framework. It operates on the assumption that at least one honest participant exists within the system. If any malicious activity occurs (e.g., an attempt to improperly release locked BTC), an honest participant can generate a fraud proof. Fraud Proofs and Dispute Resolution: This fraud proof is a cryptographic proof that demonstrates the malicious behavior. It can be verified on the Bitcoin mainnet, effectively penalizing the dishonest party and ensuring the integrity of the locked funds. This mechanism discourages fraud by making it economically irrational. This approach significantly differs from traditional wrapped BTC solutions, which often rely on a centralized entity or a small consortium of multi-sig signers. The BitVM Bridge shifts the security paradigm towards cryptographic proofs and economic incentives, aligning more closely with Bitcoin’s decentralized ethos. The Role of the Bitlayer Network in This Innovation The Bitlayer network is a Bitcoin layer-2 solution built to scale Bitcoin and enhance its smart contract capabilities. It serves as the environment where the bridged BTC can actually be used in DeFi applications. Think of it as an extension of Bitcoin, providing the infrastructure for faster, cheaper transactions and complex smart contract interactions, all while maintaining a strong connection to Bitcoin’s underlying security. Key aspects of the Bitlayer network’s role: Scalability: By processing transactions off the main Bitcoin chain, Bitlayer reduces congestion and transaction fees, making DeFi activities more accessible and efficient. Smart Contract Compatibility: It provides an environment where smart contracts can operate, enabling the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) that can interact with Bitcoin. Security Inheritance: While a separate layer, Bitlayer aims to inherit as much security from Bitcoin as possible. The BitVM Bridge is a prime example of this, using Bitcoin’s scripting capabilities for dispute resolution. Ecosystem Growth: By facilitating the seamless movement of BTC, the Bitlayer network aims to foster a vibrant ecosystem of DeFi protocols, NFTs, and other decentralized applications built on Bitcoin’s foundation. The synergy between the innovative BitVM Bridge and the robust Bitlayer network is what makes this development so powerful. The bridge gets BTC onto the network, and the network provides the platform for its utility. Why is BTC Bridging So Crucial for Decentralized Finance? For decentralized finance to truly flourish and achieve mainstream adoption, it needs access to the largest pool of cryptocurrency liquidity: Bitcoin. Historically, BTC bridging has been a complex and often centralized endeavor. Early methods involved trusted third parties holding Bitcoin and issuing corresponding tokens on other chains. While effective in the short term, these methods introduced significant counterparty risk and went against the very principles of decentralization that DeFi champions. The advent of trust-minimized BTC bridging solutions, like Bitlayer’s BitVM Bridge, is crucial because: Reduces Centralization Risk: By minimizing the need for trusted intermediaries, the risk of censorship, seizure, or single points of failure is significantly reduced. This makes the entire DeFi ecosystem more resilient. Enhances Capital Efficiency: Unlocking Bitcoin’s liquidity allows for more capital to be deployed in various DeFi protocols, leading to deeper liquidity pools, more stable lending markets, and more efficient trading. Boosts Innovation: Developers can now confidently build DeFi applications knowing they can integrate Bitcoin in a secure and decentralized manner. This fosters a new wave of innovation tailored for Bitcoin holders. Broadens DeFi Participation: Bitcoin maximalists and those wary of complex bridging mechanisms might now be more willing to explore DeFi, expanding the user base and overall adoption. The ability to move BTC across chains securely and efficiently is not just a technical feat; it’s a foundational step towards a more interconnected and robust decentralized financial system. Navigating the Future: Challenges and Opportunities in Decentralized Finance While the launch of the BitVM Bridge is a monumental step forward, the journey for Decentralized Finance , especially with Bitcoin integration, still has its challenges and immense opportunities. Challenges Ahead: Adoption and Education: Explaining complex concepts like BitVM and fraud proofs to a broader audience will be key for widespread adoption. Users need to understand the security guarantees. Scalability of Fraud Proofs: While trust-minimized, the actual generation and verification of fraud proofs on Bitcoin can be resource-intensive. Optimizing this process will be an ongoing challenge. Competition: Other Bitcoin Layer-2s and bridging solutions are also vying for market share. The landscape is competitive, requiring continuous innovation from Bitlayer. Security Audits and Real-World Testing: As with any new technology dealing with significant capital, rigorous security audits and extensive real-world testing are paramount to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities. Regulatory Landscape: The evolving regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies and DeFi could impact the growth and operational models of such bridges. Opportunities on the Horizon: New Financial Primitives: The ability to use native BTC opens the door for entirely new DeFi products and services that were previously impossible or too risky. Cross-Chain Interoperability: This development paves the way for greater interoperability between Bitcoin and other major blockchain ecosystems, creating a more unified crypto space. Increased Market Efficiency: By bringing more liquidity and more secure assets into DeFi, the overall market can become more efficient and robust. Mainstream Acceptance: As DeFi becomes more secure and accessible with Bitcoin integration, it increases its appeal to institutional investors and traditional finance, accelerating mainstream acceptance. The integration of Bitcoin into DeFi via solutions like the BitVM Bridge represents a pivotal moment, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in the decentralized economy. A New Horizon for Bitcoin’s Utility The launch of Bitlayer’s BitVM Bridge on the mainnet marks a significant milestone in the evolution of both Bitcoin and decentralized finance. By providing a truly trust-minimized framework for bringing BTC into DeFi, it addresses long-standing challenges and unlocks immense potential. No longer will Bitcoin be seen merely as a store of value, but also as a dynamic asset capable of fueling a new generation of decentralized applications. This innovation paves the way for greater liquidity, enhanced security, and unprecedented opportunities for developers and users alike. The journey of Bitcoin DeFi is just beginning, and with pioneering solutions like the BitVM Bridge, the future looks incredibly bright and interconnected.

The analyst noted that DOGE previously reached this Fibonacci level, which suggests it may do so again in this cycle. Dogecoin Price Eyes Rally Above $10 With This Fibonacci Level In an X post, DOGECAPITAL predicted that the Dogecoin price could rally above $10 if it reaches the 423.6% Fibonacci level. The analyst used the Fibonacci tool to highlight the fact that both the first and second DOGE cycles topped at the 423.6% level. Based on this, the foremost meme coin could reach this level, surpassing the $10 target. Related Reading: Dogecoin Returns To December 2020 Levels, Is Another 36,000% Rally Possible? Interestingly, DOGECAPITAL noted that should history repeat itself, the Dogecoin price could rally to as high as $36, which is where the 423.6% is. This could mark the potential top for the meme coin in this cycle. The analyst also confirmed that DOGE is nowhere near its top in this third cycle based on the historical timing of past cycles. If this historical pattern keeps playing out, DOGECAPITAL predicts that the projected top for the Dogecoin price could occur around the final week of October. The analyst also believes that the market has entered DOGE season with Bitcoin reaching new all-time highs (ATHs) and the meme coin currently sitting near key support. However, despite the current bullish sentiment in the crypto market, it is worth noting that the Dogecoin price is still sitting just below the psychological $0.2 level. As such, this raises doubts about whether the DOGE season has truly begun. Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade stated that the DOGE/BTC chart may show a God candle this season, which would kickstart the DOGE season. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Kevin Capital noted that the DOGE/BTC chart is sitting in a historical zone of support. He added that the monthly time frame indicators are also fully reset, providing the best setup for the Dogecoin price. DOGE Eyes Rally To $0.25 In The Short Term In an X post, crypto analyst Ali Martinez predicted that the Dogecoin price could rally to $0.25 in the short term. Alluding to DOGE’s daily chart, Martinez stated that the meme coin is trading within a channel and that it just bounced off the bottom. He added that a buying spike at this level could send DOGE to the top of the channel at $0.25. Related Reading: Analysts Predict Major Dogecoin Price Rally After Breaking 50-Day Trendline This level is significant as it marked the last local top for the Dogecoin price. As such, a successful break above this level could lead to higher prices for the meme coin. Meanwhile, Trader Tardigrade stated that DOGE’s daily RSI might find support soon, completing a healthy pullback and preparing for a new surge. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.19, up over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

SEC approves UXRP, the first U.S.-listed leveraged XRP ETF, set to launch on NYSE Arca. 3iQ’s Canadian XRP ETF tops $50M in assets as regulated products gain traction globally. XRP Futures Set New Record on CME CME’s XRP futures market posted its highest trading volume to date on July 11. Over $235 million in notional value changed hands in a single day, with volume spread across standard and micro contracts. This brings the total traded volume since the May 19 launch to over $1.6 billion. The contracts offer exposure to XRP without requiring token ownership. The standard contract is based on 50,000 XRP, while the micro version covers 2,500 coins. These cash-settled products are tied to CME’s XRP-Dollar Reference Rate and are available to both institutions and retail traders. Institutions Turn to Regulated Exposure CME has become a go-to exchange for investors who want access to crypto through regulated markets. Its Bitcoin and Ether futures are already widely used, and XRP is now following a similar path. The latest numbers suggest growing use of XRP futures among trading firms. CME’s Active Trader account posted , “XRP and Micro XRP futures crossed $235M notional traded on July 11.” That day, over 9,100 contracts were traded, equal to more than 82 million XRP. Micro contracts also saw their busiest session since launch. Ripple, which uses XRP for international payments, is applying for a banking license in the United States. It is also looking to register under the MiCA framework in the European Union. These moves are part of a broader strategy to build compliant infrastructure for XRP in major markets. XRP Gets First U.S. ETF as Global Demand Grows XRP futures aren’t the only regulated product gaining traction. On July 14, 3iQ reported that its XRP ETF, trading on Canada’s TSX, crossed $50 million in assets. CME data also shows that 45% of XRP futures volume comes from outside North America, pointing to strong demand across regions. Adding to this institutional wave, the SEC has approved the ProShares Ultra XRP ETF, a leveraged futures-based product set to trade under the ticker UXRP on NYSE Arca. Trading is scheduled to begin by week’s end, giving XRP its first U.S.-listed ETF exposure.
