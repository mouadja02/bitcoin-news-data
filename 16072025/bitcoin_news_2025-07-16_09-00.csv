2025-07-16T06:58:43,"Postgres Revolution: How ParadeDB Unleashes Unprecedented Data Search Amidst the AI Applications Boom","BitcoinWorld Postgres Revolution: How ParadeDB Unleashes Unprecedented Data Search Amidst the AI Applications Boom In the fast-paced world of technology, where artificial intelligence is reshaping industries and demanding unprecedented data capabilities, the underlying infrastructure often determines success. For those deeply invested in the crypto space, understanding robust data solutions is key to navigating volatile markets and complex analytics. This is where an unexpected hero emerges: Postgres , an open-source database management system nearly four decades old, is experiencing an explosive resurgence, driven by its surprising suitability for modern AI Applications . But as demand surges, a critical challenge remains: efficient data search and analytics. Enter ParadeDB, a groundbreaking solution poised to transform how we interact with vast datasets, directly challenging established players like Elasticsearch. Why is Postgres Becoming the Database of Choice for AI Applications ? For decades, Postgres has been a reliable workhorse in the database world, known for its stability, extensibility, and adherence to SQL standards. Its open-source nature fosters a vibrant community and continuous innovation. However, its recent surge in popularity is directly tied to the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence. AI models thrive on structured, reliable data, and Postgres offers a robust foundation for managing this information. Its ability to handle complex queries, support various data types, and integrate with a wide array of tools makes it an ideal backend for many AI-driven systems. As Bitcoin World has reported, industry giants are recognizing this trend, with significant acquisitions like Crunchy Data by Snowflake and Neon by Databricks underscoring Postgres’s strategic importance in the evolving data landscape. How is ParadeDB Revolutionizing Data Search and Analytics? Despite Postgres ‘s undeniable strengths, a significant gap has persisted: native, high-performance full-text search and analytics capabilities. Traditionally, organizations would resort to moving their valuable data to separate systems, such as Elasticsearch, to perform these critical functions. This introduces complexity, latency, and increased costs. ParadeDB is changing this paradigm entirely. As an innovative open-source extension, ParadeDB allows users to perform sophisticated Data Search and analytics directly within their existing Postgres databases. This eliminates the need for cumbersome data transfers, ensuring that data remains secure, consistent, and immediately accessible. ParadeDB seamlessly integrates with popular cloud Postgres offerings like Google Cloud SQL, Azure Postgres, and Amazon RDS, making it accessible to a wide range of enterprises. The Elasticsearch Challenge: Why a New Approach to Data Management Was Needed? For years, Elasticsearch has been the go-to solution for full-text search and analytics, especially for large datasets. Founded in 2012, it built its reputation on powerful search capabilities. However, its fundamental architecture often involves moving data back and forth between a primary database like Postgres and Elasticsearch itself. Philippe Noël, co-founder and CEO of ParadeDB, highlights the inherent issues with this approach. “That breaks all the time,” Noël told Bitcoin World. “The two databases are not meant to work together. There’s a lot of compatibility issues, there’s a lot of latency issues, higher costs, and all of that deteriorates the user experience.” This constant data synchronization can be a nightmare for heavy workloads or applications requiring real-time updates. ParadeDB’s core innovation lies in addressing these pain points by building directly into Postgres, offering a more integrated and efficient solution for comprehensive Data Management . Riding the AI Applications Boom: ParadeDB’s Growth and Future Vision ParadeDB’s journey began in 2023, with its founders, Philippe Noël and Ming Ying, driven by their own frustrations with Postgres search limitations during their first startup, Whist. Recognizing a widespread problem, they focused on developing a robust open-source product first. This strategy quickly paid off. In early 2024, Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba became ParadeDB’s first enterprise customer, a testament to the platform’s immediate value. This pivotal moment propelled ParadeDB into building out its enterprise software, attracting other prominent clients like Modern Treasury, Bilt Rewards, and TCDI. The company recently secured a significant $12 million Series A funding round, led by Craft Ventures with participation from existing investors including Y Combinator. These funds are earmarked for strategic hiring, expanding their current team of four to at least ten employees, and enhancing the platform’s user interface and analytics capabilities. This rapid growth trajectory underscores the immense demand for better Data Search solutions in the age of advanced AI Applications . Seamless Data Management : Real-World Impact and Integration ParadeDB’s approach to Data Management is rooted in simplicity and efficiency. By functioning as a native extension, it eliminates the operational overhead associated with managing separate search infrastructures. This direct integration means developers can leverage their existing Postgres knowledge and tools, streamlining workflows and reducing development time. The success stories from early adopters like Alibaba, Modern Treasury, Bilt Rewards, and TCDI highlight the tangible benefits: improved performance, reduced costs, and a more unified data experience. As Devin Pratt, a research director at IDC, noted to Bitcoin World, the industry is increasingly consolidating around Postgres, with major acquisitions validating its central role. ParadeDB is strategically positioned to capitalize on this trend, offering a compelling alternative to traditional, separate search solutions. “We think building on Postgres is actually a meaningful shift,’” Noël concluded. “Because that’s where the data is, and you can make a meaningful dent in Elasticsearch ’s market share by meeting users where their data is, rather than building something that’s marginally faster or marginally cheaper.” In conclusion, ParadeDB represents a significant leap forward in database technology, particularly for organizations grappling with the demands of modern AI Applications . By empowering Postgres with native, high-performance Data Search and analytics, it offers a powerful, integrated, and cost-effective solution that challenges the status quo established by legacy systems like Elasticsearch . As the world becomes increasingly data-driven, ParadeDB’s innovative approach to Data Management positions it as a key player in the next generation of enterprise infrastructure.

2025-07-16T06:54:07,"Circle Applies to OCC: Reinforcing Control in USDC Reserves","The post Circle Applies to OCC: Reinforcing Control in USDC Reserves appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The stablecoin issuer, Circle Internet Group, applied to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) on June 30 to establish a US trust bank called First National Digital Currency Bank. If OCC approves, the trust bank would oversee the company’s reserves of USDC (its dollar-pegged stablecoin) and offer digital asset custody services to institutional clients. Why Did Circle Apply for National Digital Currency Bank Currently, the BlacRock manages the majority of Circle’s stablecoin reserves, which is not ideal for the company. It makes the stablecoin users susceptible to risks without warranting their safety. Without a strong, trustworthy structure, the company would become vulnerable and would be exposed to legal uncertainties. Additionally, this will result in token collapse and scaling back the adoption rate. So, the company is applying to the National Trust Bank to strengthen its USDC infrastructure. Circle’s Key Objectives with National Digital Currency Bank The National Trust Bank will be managing USDC reserves and tokenized treasuries in Circle while offering on-chain payments under federal oversight. This initiative aims to help Circle meet the requirements in the GENIUS Act. One of Circle’s primary goals is to build an internet financial system that is transparent, efficient, and accessible to all users, ensuring legal compliance. Circle plans to focus on the custody of tokenized assets — stocks and bonds on blockchain rails, rather than cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Amid the global trends of modernizing traditional markets by integrating blockchain technology, Circle is fortifying its blockchain priority to meet the global demand. Has the OCC Application Been Approved? The OCC has not yet approved Circle’s application for a national trust bank charter. The process of reviewing the application includes a public comment period of 30 days before finalizing. Generally, the complete process takes 120 days, examining the necessary documentation, business summary, compliance, requirements of global standards, and outline of the services it aspires to provide. Final Thought With over $62 billion in USDC circulation, Circle is thriving in the global competition of digital assets. The company is actively working to terminate its reliance on a third party to oversee its digital asset reserves while strengthening internal control by minimizing risks and enhancing transparency.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/circle-applies-to-occ-reinforcing-control-in-usdc-reserves/,"USDC|FIAT|BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|BTC","News",cryptocompare

2025-07-16T06:47:53,"Crypto Regulations in Argentina 2025","The post Crypto Regulations in Argentina 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In Argentina, cryptocurrency is treated as a form of digital asset, allowing trading, storage, and usage without major restrictions. To ensure the safe and secure use of crypto, the Argentine federal government has implemented important regulations governing its use, including a VASP license, registration, and strict compliance with AMK and CFT. In 2025, Argentina is actively implementing a regulatory framework for crypto to enhance oversight and align with global standards. Major Crypto Regulations in Argentina 2025 April 14, 2025 – Cepo Cambiario The Argentine government lifted most currency controls, also known as “ cepo cambiario ”, allowing individuals to buy US dollars without restrictions. This deregulation extended to transactions involving cryptocurrency, expanding liberalization of foreign exchange. March 14, 2025- Resolution 1058/2025 The rule was issued by the National Securities Commission (CNV) to establish a mandatory registration system for virtual asset service providers (VASPs). It also seeks to align Argentina with global anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CFT) standards recommended by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The full regulatory framework will take effect on December 31, 2025. The deadline for registration of entities is as follows: Individuals– before July 1, 2025; Legal bodies in Argentina– before August 1, 2025; Foreign legal entities– before September 1, 2025. Timeline of crypto regulations: Date Law/ Regulations Details July 18, 2024 Decree 640/2024 Legal framework for the tokenization of goods March 25, 2024 CNV resolution 994/2024 Mandatory VASP registration with CNV March 25, 2024 UIF Resolution 49/2024 VASPs as UIF reporting entities, AML/CFT obligations March 14, 2024 Law 27,739 VASP registration, AML/CFT, phased compliance deadline December 20, 2023 Decree 70/2023 Legal validity of crypto contracts reaffirmed May 4, 2023 Central bank ban Banks decline to offer crypto services What is the Argentine Government Saying About Crypto? In 2025, the Argentine government took a progressive stance towards cryptocurrency, recognizing it as a digital asset. President Javier Milei’s administration has fostered this environment by initiating new legislation to encourage the growth of the cryptocurrency sector. The government’s key focus is: Allowing regulated use in transactions and contracts of crypto Ensure security and consumer protection within the crypto market Promotion of crypto adoption and investment in digital assets as part of the broader economy. Crypto Tax in Argentina 2025 Important note: Crypto is an intangible property, so holding crypto is not taxed, but profits or income from transactions are taxable, aligning with fiscal modernization efforts. Tax reporting: The Financial year runs from January 1 to December 31, and tax returns are due by June 30 of the following year. Crypto tax can be reported through AFIP’s online tax portal. Tax type Tax rate Tax applicability Capital gains tax (CGT) 15% Profits from selling/ exchanging crypto Income tax 5% to 35% Earnings from mining, staking, and payments Personal property tax 0.25%- 1.25% Year-end value of crypto holdings VAT 21% Crypto is used to buy goods and services International transfers 5% -15% Cross-border crypto transactions. Crypto License in Argentina There are no specific licenses in Argentina for crypto businesses; only the Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) registration is required to operate. The Resolution General 994/2024 defined the VASP, while Ley 277739 specified the regulatory (CNV) and functions of VASPs. All crypto companies must register if their transaction volume exceeds 35,000 UVA (approx $29,246). Exemptions for monthly volume below this threshold are also available. Penalty: Failure to register can result in the disqualification of the crypto platform and cease it from operating. Under Ley 27739, the VASP can engage in: Exchange of virtual assets for fiat currencies. Exchange of one virtual asset for another. Transfer of virtual assets. Custody and management of virtual assets. Financial services related to virtual assets offerings and sales. Crypto Adoption In Argentina User penetration rate: The crypto user penetration is expected to be 22.80% in 2025 and is projected to increase to 23.80% by 2026. The number of users in the crypto market is expected to reach 10.95 million by next year. Crypto revenue: The current projected crypto revenue is estimated to reach US$940.9 million in 2025. As the crypto market is growing rapidly in the region, the estimation for 2026 is growing at a rate of 16.02%, depicting US$1.1 billion crypto revenue by 2026. Crypto holdings: The Argentine government has not disclosed its crypto holdings yet; policies are prioritizing creating a framework for crypto regulations to protect investors and consumers. Conclusion Argentina’s recent policies and the government’s active efforts in the crypto space have promised further exploration of blockchain tokenization and open finance. The country is fully supporting high fintech adoption to balance security with modernization. The primary goal of the government is to establish a better digital framework to boost the economy with cryptocurrency and other digital assets. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-16T06:42:12,"Crypto Bulls Rejoice: Congresswoman Confirms Powell’s Imminent Firing","A single-word reply on X from Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R‑FL) — “Confirmed” — rocketed through the crypto markets early Wednesday, convincing a growing chorus of traders that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s tenure is measured in days, not months. Within minutes of Luna’s affirmation that “Jerome Powell is going to be fired. Firing is imminent,” prediction‑market odds of his ouster on Polymarket leapt to 26 percent, the highest reading this year, up from 16 percent only 24 hours earlier. A White‑House‑backed search is already under way. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, in an on‑record Bloomberg interview, acknowledged “a formal process that’s already starting” to identify Powell’s successor, adding that “there are a lot of good candidates inside and outside the Federal Reserve.” Related Reading: ‘Crypto Week’ Takes A Hit: US House Fails To Advance Key Acts President Donald Trump underscored the point during an impromptu press gaggle, repeating last week’s warning that “the renovations at the central bank were a fireable offense.” Those renovations — an over‑budget, $2.5 billion overhaul of the Fed’s historic Eccles Building — have become the legal pretext for dismissal, with Trump allies alleging “inefficiency” and “neglect of duty,” two of the three causes for removal spelled out in the Federal Reserve Act. Powell has asked the Fed’s inspector general to reopen its review of the project. Notably, Bill Pulte, the Federal Housing Finance Agency head and a longtime Powell critic, confirmed the rumors to his followers on X: “I heard from a very credible, bipartisan source, today, that Jerome Powell is considering resigning. This maps with both reports and also the talk in DC.” Crypto Markets Sense A Massive Bull Run The Bitcoin and crypto prices haven’t shown any reaction to the rumor yet. After piercing $123,000 on Monday, BTC is still 4.5 percent below the record high. The entire crypto market seems to be in a wait-and-see position. However, long-term, the implication could be profound for the crypto markets. “I cannot think of a more bullish catalyst for Bitcoin in the past five years than the complete and utter humiliation of Jerome Powell,” wrote macro commentator Julian Figueroa, pointing to what he called the “façade” of central‑bank independence collapsing in real time. Related Reading: Happy Ending: Crypto Hacker Returns Funds From $42 Million GMX Exploit Long‑time trader Byzantine General echoed the ambivalence: “Powell was actually a great Fed chair. But… if he resigns then it’s very likely that whoever comes next will lower rates, which is bullish for our cryptographic currencies.” Should President Trump succeed in replacing Powell with a more accommodating successor—one prepared to deliver the “three‑percentage‑point” rate cut he has publicly demanded—the Federal Reserve would likely be forced to shelve its balance‑sheet runoff precisely as Washington ramps up fresh fiscal stimulus.

2025-07-16T06:36:40,"How Bitcoin Could Hit $200K on Global Institutional Inflows Alone","“Institutional capital can no longer ignore the returns that Bitcoin is providing,” reported the Kobeissi Letter on Tuesday. The cryptocurrency cannot be ignored because it has yielded a 90% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the past 13 years, which no other asset can match. Even “conservative” funds are allocating 1% of their assets under management to Bitcoin as treasury trend momentum builds, they observed. Massive Institutional Inflows Currently, there is an estimated $31 trillion in institutional AUM in the United States, Kobeissi stated. “If just 1% of US institutional capital flows into Bitcoin, this could drive another $300 billion into the asset,” they said. A further $300 billion added to Bitcoin’s $2.34 trillion market capitalization would drive prices up around 13% which would put the asset at $133,000. This figure has been widely predicted by analysts as a short-term target. “Factor in global institutional AUM, and we could see $1 trillion+ flow into Bitcoin,” they said. Another $1 trillion added to the BTC market cap would drive prices up by 70%, which would put it closer to $200,000. “Bitcoin has simply become too big to ignore.” Bitcoin’s next catalyst has arrived: Simply put, institutional capital can no longer ignore the returns that Bitcoin is providing. When an asset provides a return of 90% in one year, it can be ruled an “outlier.” However, when an asset provides a 90% CAGR for 13 years… — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) July 15, 2025 All this is hypothetically achievable without any retail participation in markets. Institutions are already driving the current market rally. BlackRock , for example, has hoovered up a whopping 717,388 BTC, or 3.6% of the entire circulating supply. Meanwhile, Strategy has accumulated 601,550 BTC, 3% of the circulating supply. These two entities alone hold a whopping 6.6% of the entire Bitcoin supply, currently valued at $155 billion. As more institutional Bitcoin funds are launched, and more corporations and nation states stack the asset for their treasuries, the price can only go one way in the long term. BTC Price Outlook Bitcoin is still cooling from its July 14 all-time high and remains down 4.3% from that level. The asset was trading flat on the day at $117,850 at the time of writing, holding around support levels. It is possible that consolidation could continue for some time before the next leg up into the $130,000 range. The retreat has been caused by long-term holders taking profit , not institutions liquidating their stashes. Glassnode reported that this week saw “one of the largest BTC profit realization days this year, driven mostly by long-term holders.” The post How Bitcoin Could Hit $200K on Global Institutional Inflows Alone appeared first on CryptoPotato .",cryptopotato,https://cryptopotato.com/how-bitcoin-could-hit-200k-on-global-institutional-inflows-alone/,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|REGULATION","AA News|Crypto News|Bitcoin|Bitcoin (BTC) Price",cryptocompare

2025-07-16T06:34:08,"First Bitcoin, Then Ethereum On the Move! Analysts Explain Their Expectations: ""ETH May Be on the Verge of an Unprecedented Rise!""","Bitcoin (BTC) made a major push at the beginning of the week, surpassing $123,000 and breaking a new record. While this rise had limited impact on altcoins, Ethereum (ETH) and other altcoins began to surge as profit-taking began in BTC. Ethereum Goes on the Attack! At this point, Ethereum reclaimed the $3,000 level for the first time since February 1st and reached a 5-month high of $3,150. Analytics firm Swissblock said that one of the key drivers behind Ethereum's rise is the capital rotation from Bitcoin. Analysts noted that Bitcoin's previous four bullish waves this year lasted between 15 and 30 days. They noted that the current rally has reached its 12th day, and that profit-taking may begin in BTC after that. They also noted that capital flowing out of BTC could flow into altcoins, particularly ETH, which could further boost ETH. Analysts also noted that the ETH/BTC ratio broke upwards for the first time since May, signaling a trend reversal. They noted that ETH/BTC had broken above its 200-day moving average for the first time in a year, indicating medium- to long-term upward momentum for ETH. Bullish Predictions for Ethereum Are Increasing! Pseudonymous crypto analyst Merlijn The Trader also argued that Ethereum could experience an unprecedented rally. Accordingly, the analyst claimed that ETH could follow a trajectory similar to Bitcoin's 2018-2021 market cycle. If Ethereum follows BTC's 2018-2021 cycle, it could experience a 1,100% rally. He noted that ETH's current price movements mirror those of BTC between 2028 and 2021, particularly the rates of increase and correction being identical. According to the analyst, ETH could experience the same 1,100% increase as BTC from now on. This means Ethereum could potentially rally to around $18,205. While the analyst's chart suggests a significant rally is imminent for Ethereum, it alone isn't enough to trigger a surge. Don't base your investment decisions on a single piece of data or analysis. These analyses are often fallible and are merely helpful data that has never been proven 100% accurate. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: First Bitcoin, Then Ethereum On the Move!

2025-07-16T06:30:10,"‘You Can’t Put the Genie Back’: Bitwise CIO Reveals Why Crypto May Never Be the Same Again","The conversation around cryptocurrency in the United States appears to be entering a new phase as key legislation gains traction in Congress. According to Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan, the passage of several pro-crypto bills under discussion in Washington could have lasting implications for the market. In a note to clients, Hougan emphasized the long-term structural shift underway, stating that once these bills pass, “you can’t put the genie back in the bottle.” The legislative push, dubbed “Crypto Week” by Hougan, follows a declaration by the US House of Representatives to advance three major pieces of digital currency-focused legislation. These include the GENIUS Act, which aims to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins; the CLARITY Act, designed to regulate broader digital currency assets; and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, which would prohibit the introduction of a US central bank digital currency (CBDC). The GENIUS Act has already cleared the Senate, placing it a step closer to becoming law. Legislative Clarity Could Reduce Structural Risk in Crypto Hougan argues that regulatory clarity could play a pivotal role in reducing systemic risk across the digital asset industry. He noted that many of the high-profile failures in the digital currency space, including FTX, Terra (Luna), Celsius, and Mt. Gox, were enabled by a lack of oversight . In the absence of defined rules, offshore platforms with inadequate internal controls and auditing were able to thrive, resulting in significant losses for users. He contends that proper legislation could have prevented such failures. “If clear regulations had allowed safer versions of these services to exist in the US, many of the historical blow-ups might not have occurred,” Hougan stated. Regulatory guidelines, according to the note, could also facilitate entry for traditional financial institutions, allowing for crypto custody and services through familiar, regulated channels. That shift could improve investor confidence and potentially limit the frequency and severity of market drawdowns. Hougan also believes that the passage of these bills could diminish the likelihood of future extreme price crashes. While Bitcoin remains one of the best-performing assets over the last 15 years, its history includes multiple drawdowns exceeding 70%. Hougan argues that enhanced regulation could limit the impact of unpredictable events that trigger such volatility. Bipartisan Support and Institutional Buy-In Signal Lasting Momentum While some may question whether future administrations could reverse pro-crypto momentum, Hougan remains unconcerned. He pointed out that support for legislation like the GENIUS Act has been bipartisan, passing the Senate 68-30 with significant backing from both Democrats and Republicans. He attributes this cross-party alignment not only to generational voter interests but also to Wall Street’s growing involvement in crypto . According to Hougan, as financial institutions like BlackRock, JPMorgan, and Morgan Stanley expand their crypto operations, the likelihood of political reversal diminishes. “As a broader array of investors and firms becomes involved in crypto, it will be increasingly difficult for politicians to align against it,” he said. Should these legislative efforts succeed, Hougan concludes that crypto is positioned to transition further into the mainstream. With clearer rules, reduced risk, and rising institutional support, the digital asset market may be entering a new era of growth and maturity.

Key Takeaways: U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs extended their inflow streak to nine days, adding $403 million on Tuesday. Despite gains, outflows hit Grayscale’s GBTC, Fidelity’s FBTC, and Ark & 21Shares’ ARKB. Ethereum spot ETFs also recorded eight straight days of inflows, adding $192 million. Leading the charge was BlackRock’s IBIT, which alone saw $416.35 million in new money, followed by VanEck’s HODL with $19 million. Other funds such as Grayscale’s Mini Bitcoin Trust and Bitwise’s BITB also reported positive inflows for the day. Notable Outflows Hit Grayscale, Fidelity, and Ark Bitcoin Funds However, the gains were partially offset by outflows from three funds: Grayscale’s GBTC lost $41.22 million, Fidelity’s FBTC saw $23 million exit, and Ark & 21Shares’ ARKB dropped by $6.21 million. Spot bitcoin ETFs have now amassed a cumulative total of $53.07 billion in net inflows, with $4.4 billion added over the past nine trading days alone. The surge builds on a strong run that began in April, during which these funds have drawn nearly $17 billion. Ethereum spot ETFs have followed suit, marking their eighth straight day of net inflows, with $192.33 million added on Tuesday. Bitcoin currently trades at $117,373, holding steady near a key support level despite pulling back from a recent all-time high of $123,000 set earlier this week. “Bitcoin has been able to maintain a solid position at around $118K after core CPI data was lower than expected, prompting speculation that the Fed will be more likely to cut interest rates in September, potentially leading to a surge of demand for bitcoin,” said Nick Ruck, director of LVRG Research. #BTC we’re back at $116K as planned.

On Friday, 11 spot Bitcoin ETF products reported combined inflows totaling $1.03 billion, following $1.17 billion the previous day. Recently, BlackRock reported earning more revenue from IBIT than from its flagship iShares Core S&P 500 ETF. 95% Approval Chance for Spot Solana, XRP ETFS As reported, Bloomberg’s senior ETF analysts have assigned a 95% chance that the SEC will approve spot ETFs for Solana, XRP, and Litecoin this year, raising their previous odds from 90% amid growing optimism for institutional crypto products. They also expect a crypto index ETF tracking multiple assets could gain approval as early as this week, signaling broader access to altcoins for traditional investors. Beyond ETFs, institutional Bitcoin demand is spreading into corporate treasuries. Japan’s Metaplanet recently bought $93 million worth of BTC , becoming the fifth-largest corporate holder with a stack exceeding 16,300 BTC. France’s The Blockchain Group and the UK’s Smarter Web Company also made new BTC treasury allocations this week, purchasing $12.5 million and $24.3 million worth of Bitcoin respectively.

According to analyst Rekt Capital, the PI Cycle Top uses two moving averages to signal when Bitcoin may be nearing its top. Historically, these moving averages, especially the 111-day average, have accurately predicted the end of previous bull markets. Recently, this faster-moving average has been rising sharply. Back on June 1, it was tracking around $92,000, but now it’s already near $98,000, just under $100K. This quick rise shows how strong the current price momentum is. What’s important here is how fast the predicted “crossover,” when the two moving averages intersect, is moving forward in time. A few days ago, the crossover was projected for April 2027, but now it’s shifted to February 2027. And if Bitcoin continues to consolidate or climb, that crossover could move even closer — possibly into 2026 or even late 2025. Why does this matter? Because when the crossover occurs, it has typically marked the top of the bull market. If the trend continues, we could see this crossover hit when Bitcoin is priced somewhere between $130,000 to $170,000, or even more if momentum keeps building. The key takeaway: While we may still be early in this bull run, the data is telling us that the window to take profits could arrive as early as the second half of 2025. The PI Cycle Top Indicator won’t act alone, but it’s one of the most reliable tools we have to track when the cycle might end.

The inflation increase appears to have affected investor sentiment. After reaching a new high above $123,000 on Monday, Bitcoin has since declined by roughly 5.4% from that peak, with its price currently trading just above $116,000. The broader crypto market also reacted to the news, with the global crypto market cap valuation dropping by nearly 7% in the past day amid renewed uncertainty about future interest rate policy. While Bitcoin has exhibited a strong uptrend in recent weeks, the latest pullback introduces short-term volatility that analysts are watching closely. One particularly notable development occurred on-chain: a transfer of 10,000 BTC, valued at roughly $1.2 billion, from a dormant address last active over a decade ago. Related Reading: The Bitcoin Liquidity Supercycle Has Just Begun, Says Hedge Fund CEO Historic Bitcoin Transfer Raises Eyebrows, but No Signs of Exchange Activity CryptoQuant analyst Carmelo Alemán shared insights into the large transaction in a recent post titled “10,000 Historic BTC Move On-Chain.” According to Alemán, the transaction occurred on July 14 at 16:17 UTC, moving 10,000 BTC from address ‘bc1q84…7ef6k ‘ to ‘bc1qmu….8v2p.’ These coins had not moved in over 10 years, indicating they likely originated from early miners during Bitcoin’s earliest phases when the block reward was 50 BTC. Alemán noted that such old unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) often trigger concern about potential sell-offs, but in this case, further analysis suggests a more neutral interpretation. The movement of old coins can occur for various reasons, including UTXO consolidation, wallet upgrades, or potential sales. Alemán explained that this transfer displayed characteristics consistent with consolidation for efficiency and security purposes. For example, the transaction used 16 different inputs, which can help reduce future transaction fees. Additionally, no corresponding inflow to centralized exchanges (CEXs) was detected, typically a key signal when holders intend to liquidate. The analyst also pointed out that two small test transactions were sent to the receiving address before the full transfer. These included a 0.00089 BTC and a 1 BTC transaction, commonly used to verify wallet accessibility before moving a large sum. Interestingly, two hours after the initial transaction, the same destination wallet received another transfer of 10,009 BTC, bringing the total to more than 20,000 BTC moved in the span of a few hours. Implications for Market Behavior and On-Chain Trends While the transaction did not lead to immediate market selling, it has added to ongoing discussions about the role of long-term holders in Bitcoin’s supply dynamics. Large transfers from early addresses are rare and often interpreted as strategic reorganization of funds. Alemán noted that the absence of exchange-related activity makes it unlikely that the coins are being liquidated in the short term.

Hedera Price prediction highlights HBAR could reach $0.750 by the end of 2025 if bullish trends continue. The Long-term forecasts suggest HBAR could hit $2.20 by 2030, indicating stable growth potential. Hedera has been making waves in the crypto space, having entered the top 20 digital assets by market cap in 2024, and now eyeing a potential leap into the top 10 by the end of 2025. With increasing real-world use cases, institutional interest, and strategic partnerships, many are closely tracking HBAR price prediction 2025 to gauge how high the token can rise. With major companies like Google, IBM, and Chainlink Labs backing the project, and talks of an HBAR ETF approval, many are asking: Will HBAR Price Hit $1?

All-time low. $0.01001 (January 2nd, 2020). Hedera Price Analysis: H1 2025 Hedera experienced a volatile first half of 2025. After peaking at $0.40 in mid-January, the HBAR price began a steady decline. External factors and waning investor engagement were evident in the TVL, which contributed to this downturn. Ultimately, HBAR was pushed into a converging falling wedge pattern, hitting a low of $0.125 in early April. However, the tide began to turn in the second week of April. A broader crypto rally provided a much-needed lift for HBAR, breaking free from the wedge and bouncing off a robust support zone that had previously fueled a rally in Q4 2024. This zone, validated by the Fixed Range Volume Profile (FRVP) indicator, indicated strong buying interest and set the stage for a sharp rebound. In a remarkable surge, HBAR climbed nearly 80%, rising from $0.125 to $0.228 between April and mid-May. Unfortunately, this momentum was short-lived, as geopolitical tensions escalated in mid-May, causing HBAR’s price to retreat back to its April lows, forming another parallel declining wedge on the chart. By the end of June, HBAR remained within that channel but started to see bears losing grip to bulls, when entering July, momentum blasted, breaking the upper border of the parallel channel. Hedera Price Targets July 2025 Precisely in July, from the declining parallel channel, Hedera saw strong demand starting from $0.125 in late June to mid-July, where HBAR spiked 108% to $0.26, piercing through all short-term and long-term EMA bands. This movement followed a boost from the ceasefire announcement in late June and was further bolstered by Bitcoin hitting an all-time high of $123,231. As of mid-July, Hedera experienced a slight halt as Bitcoin and the overall market witnessed early profit booking, marking a cooldown phase before another potential rally. If the bulls regain strength and achieve a daily close above $0.270, HBAR price could potentially retest the $0.34 and $0.40 resistance levels in July or the coming months. Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High HBAR Price Prediction July 2025 $0.125 $0.27 $0.40 Hedera Price Prediction 2025 (H2) Looking ahead, if the momentum persists, HBAR price might even reach $0.75 by year-end. However, on the downside, failing to maintain the $0.190 support zone could pull it down towards multi-month support at $0.125. Below this level, the price could even drop toward $0.072. Also, while TVL was previously down, it has witnessed a resurgence, with investor trust reflected in TVL increasing from $75 million to $114 million within the last 30 days. Hedera’s internal developments also tell a promising story. The ecosystem continues to expand, with the launch of its first native hardware wallet, Citadel , and an AI-based tool called the Hedera Agent Kit , which simplifies token creation. Another significant project, HashSphere, is set to launch in Q3 2025, aiming to provide a private, regulated blockchain for stablecoin-based payments and asset management. Moreover, Hedera underwent a rebranding on May 15, with the HBAR Foundation now known as the Hedera Foundation and the Governing Council rebranded as the Hedera Council. This restructuring positions Hedera for a stronger future, signaling maturity within its ecosystem.

2025-07-16T05:55:57,"Jameson Lopp proposes that BTC owners avoid quantum-vulnerable addresses.","Jameson Lopp, CTO and co-founder of the self-custody platform Casa, along with five other developers, has proposed new strategies to counter the potential threat of quantum computing. Their proposal aims to steer Bitcoin holders to adopt more secure, quantum-resistant storage methods and implement additional protective measures. Quantum algorithms are a threat to Bitcoin’s cryptographic pillars Crypto experts say quantum computing could break Bitcoin’s encryption system. The network applies cryptographic security measures such as the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) to protect wallets and SHA-256 to confirm mining and transactions. Quantum algorithms, however, pose a threat to these systems. For example, Shor’s algorithm might allow attackers to solve the math underlying these protections, making it possible to expose a private key from a known public key. Many Pay-to-Public-Key (P2PK) and Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash (P2PKH) addresses are exposed, which puts an estimated 25% of Bitcoin’s total supply in danger, according to a Deloitte study. Furthermore, with identifiable public keys, Satoshi Nakamoto’s dormant wallets would also be vulnerable to quantum attacks . The same applies to another quantum algorithm that threatens the security of Bitcoin — Grover’s algorithm , which cuts the effective security of SHA-256 by 50%. In May, Lopp had cautioned that quantum signature schemes have become significantly larger, which could reopen debates about Bitcoin’s ability to handle high transaction volumes. He also warned that if a quantum computer could break the ECDSA pillar, it would be disastrous—stolen BTC will fill the markets, undermining trust and possibly triggering a price collapse. Experts have articulated that existing quantum computers cannot crack ECDSA now. Some anticipate that quantum computing will become a real threat in at least 10 years, seeing how engineers are still working on building fault-tolerant systems. However, some analysts believe Bitcoin could be in trouble in the next five years if quantum computers advance beyond expectations, an opinion many have brushed off as unlikely. Earlier, Lopp argued that while it’s not easy to estimate how long they have before quantum computing becomes a real threat, the Bitcoin community should collaborate to come up with solutions before it grows into an existential crisis. Lopp’s proposal would have BTC owners shift to post-quantum secure addresses Lopp had help from five other developers to draft the Bitcoin improvement plan. In the proposal, they iterated that Bitcoin is under threat, noting that a successful quantum attack would hurt economies and possibly the entire ecosystem. The proposal also details that miners would have to transfer funds to post-quantum secure addresses and restrict Bitcoin spending within five years. It stated: “It turns quantum security into a private incentive. Fail to upgrade [to a new address type] and you will certainly lose access to your funds.” Ideally, the plan includes incentives for Bitcoin owners who shift to more secure addresses. In his proposal, Lopp also references BIP 360, an upgrade created by Anduro’s Senior Protocol Engineer, Hunter Beast, to introduce address formats incorporating post-quantum cryptography at varying security levels. Other developers, such as Michael B. Casey, Director of Engineering at Marathon, have also contributed their own ideas to strengthen Bitcoin’s defenses. Casey introduced the hourglass narrative, dictating that vulnerable wallet types like pay-to-public-key reduce their number of transactions. He argued that fewer transactions would give the community time to look into other alternatives, at least delaying access to tokens to eight months from a few hours. He further noted that the move would cause hackers to target the older wallets that many people rarely use. Meanwhile, tech giants like Google and Microsoft have poured significant resources into advancing quantum computing.

2025-07-16T05:54:09,"Bad News Came Yesterday for the Three Major US Cryptocurrency Bills! Trump Intervened, Problem Solved! Crucial Vote Today! Here Are the Details","Cryptocurrency week in the US has started with negativity. Accordingly, cryptocurrency legislation that was expected to be voted on in the US House of Representatives this week has been postponed due to a procedural vote failure. In the vote held yesterday, the proposal, which would have paved the way for the discussion of three important cryptocurrency bills, was rejected with 223 “no” votes against 196 “yes” votes. Following the rejection decision, there was a positive development in laws that are of great importance to US President Donald Trump. Trump intervened and announced a meeting with House members who oppose the procedural agreement for the GENIUS Act. At this point, Trump said that an agreement had been reached to hold a vote again on July 16 and advance the stablecoin bill in the US. Donald Trump said on Truth Social that he met with 11 of the 12 people needed for the passage of the GENIUS Act in the Oval Office. According to Trump's post, the group agreed to vote on the morning of July 16. House Speaker Mike Johnson joined the meeting by phone and stated that he was ready to move forward with a vote as soon as possible. This update came after the House failed to hold a procedural vote on the bill. “I'm currently in the Oval Office at the White House with 11 of the 12 members of the House of Representatives whose approval is needed for passage of the GENIUS Act. After a brief discussion, they all agreed to vote yes tomorrow morning. I hope the vote will take place as soon as possible tomorrow. I extend my gratitude to the representatives for their prompt and positive response.” What Are These Laws? This week, dubbed “Crypto Week,” features two important bills on the House agenda: the National Innovation Guidelines and Establishment for U.S. Stablecoins Act (GENIUS) and the Digital Asset Market Openness Act (Clarity). The GENIUS law stipulates that stablecoin issuances must be fully collateralized only by US dollars or similar liquid assets, requires annual audits for issuers with a market capitalization over $50 billion, and establishes rules for overseas stablecoin issuance. The Clarity Act, meanwhile, aims to clarify the regulatory framework for crypto assets by offering a more comprehensive approach. It clarifies the roles and jurisdictions of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), as well as requiring digital asset service providers to notify individual investors and segregate client funds from company assets. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-16T05:48:26,"BNB Price Stalls: Struggles to Resume Gains While Altcoins Rally","BNB price is correcting gains from the $708 zone. The price is now facing hurdles near $692 and might dip again toward the $675 support. BNB price is attempting to recover from the $675 support zone. The price is now trading below $690 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $692 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair must stay above the $680 level to start another increase in the near term. BNB Price Faces Hurdles After a steady increase, BNB price failed to clear the $710 zone. There was a downside correction below the $690 and $680 levels, unlike Ethereum and Bitcoin . The price even dipped below $678 and tested $675. A low was formed at $674 and the price is now attempting to recover. There was a move above $680. The price climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $707 swing high to the $674 low. However, the bears are active near $692. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $692 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. The price is now trading below $690 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $692 level. The next resistance sits near the $695 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $707 swing high to the $674 low. A clear move above the $695 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $708. A close above the $708 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $720 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $732 level in the near term. Another Decline? If BNB fails to clear the $692 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $682 level. The next major support is near the $680 level. The main support sits at $674. If there is a downside break below the $674 support, the price could drop toward the $665 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $650 level. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for BNB/USD is losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BNB/USD is currently below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $685 and $680.

2025-07-16T05:33:25,"Cantor Fitzgerald to Finalize $4B Bitcoin Acquisition Deal With Blockstream Founder: Report","Wall Street investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald and Blockstream Capital founder Adam Back are reportedly working on a SPAC merger valued at approximately $4 billion. Brandon Lutnick, the Chairman of Cantor Fitzgerald, is in “late-stage talks” with Back on a direct Bitcoin transfer deal, exceeding $3 billion, sources told the Financial Times . Cantor Equity Partners 1, a special-purpose acquisition company, would issue new shares to Back in exchange for 30,000 Bitcoin. Further, the company seeks to raise $800 million in outside capital for additional Bitcoin purchases, the report said. Following the completion of the transaction, the vehicle will be renamed BSTR Holdings. Cantor Equity Partners 1 launched in January with $200 million from its IPO to target crypto investments. JUST IN: Cantor Fitzgerald is nearing a $4B SPAC deal with @adam3us & @Blockstream to acquire 30,000+ BTC. ➤ #Bitcoin contributed for equity ➤ Up to $800M in additional capital raised ➤ Mirrors $3.6B SoftBank–Tether venture Another major move in the rise of corporate… pic.twitter.com/pzfiEgHhdg — Bitcoin For Corporations (@BitcoinForCorps) July 15, 2025 Cantor’s Growing Institutional Interest in Bitcoin The deal, if completed, would mirror a $3.6 billion Bitcoin acquisition in April , directed by Lutnick that involves Soft Bank and Tether. Brandon Lutnick took over as chairman of Cantor Fitzgerald early this year, after his father, Howard Lutnick, joined the Trump administration as commerce secretary. Cantor’s combined SPAC, BSTR Holdings and Twenty One Capital, could accumulate nearly $10 billion in Bitcoin this year. Additionally, in the Cantor-Blockstream deal, the investment banking giant would partner with one of the crypto industry’s earliest supporters – Adam Back. Back, who has long championed institutional adoption as a path to “hyperbitcoinization,” has personally funded several Bitcoin-focused companies. In June, he funded a $15 million convertible bond for Swedish health technology and bitcoin treasury company H100 Group, which has plans to stockpile Bitcoin . Crypto Investors Turn to SPAC or Reverse Mergers Several crypto investors are turning to SPACs to publicly list their crypto ventures. Recently, Trump’s crypto adviser, David Bailey-led Nakamoto Holdings announced that it had raised $51.5 million for its own Bitcoin treasury firm, which it plans to take public via merger with KindlyMD. Last month, Anthony Pompliano announced a $1 billion business merger to create a Bitcoin-native firm, ProCap Financial. The company will go public through a SPAC with Columbus Circle Capital Corp. If completed, the Cantor SPAC deal would become the latest in a series of high-profile deals to buy Bitcoin.

2025-07-16T05:31:52,"Ether, Dogecoin Lead Modest Market Gains, Bitcoin Holds $118K as CPI Print Fuels Rate Cut Bets","Bitcoin (BTC) hovered near $118,000 during the Asian trading hours on Wednesday, consolidating gains after June’s U.S. CPI data signaled further disinflation, pushing traders to reprice odds of a September Fed rate cut. Core CPI rose just 0.1% month-over-month for the fifth straight time, fanning bullish sentiment across crypto markets despite broader equity weakness. “The data was bullish for crypto, as the Fed may be more likely to cut interest rates in September, potentially triggering more capital to flow into the crypto industry,” said Eugene Cheung, chief commercial officer of OSL. “Bitcoin’s price held up well as a testament to traders’ optimism, despite some crypto stocks dropping after the GENIUS Act failed to pass a procedural vote, which will continue to be refined by lawmakers for another vote,"" Cheung added. The data sparked a rebound in ether (ETH) which reclaimed the $3,100 level amid inflows into spot ETFs and tailwinds from a newly passed stablecoin bill, seen as reinforcing ETH’s role as a base layer for tokenized dollars. Dogecoin (DOGE) was sitting near 19 cents, delivering a modest 2.7% daily climb and extending its weekly gain to roughly 15%. Solana's SOL (SOL) remains steady at $163, while XRP (XRP) trades near $2.92, reflecting steady interest. BNB (BNB) trades around $688, holding onto recent gains, and TRON's TRX (TRX) remains flat at about 3 cents. Institutional flows remained strong. U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs logged their ninth consecutive day of net inflows, with $403 million added Tuesday. BlackRock’s IBIT alone saw $416 million in new funds, more than offsetting $70 million in combined outflows from GBTC, FBTC and ARKB, according to SoSoValue. Spot ether (ETH) ETFs also posted $192 million in inflows, their eighth straight positive day. In the macro backdrop, Asian markets slipped and U.S. equity futures dipped as traders reassessed the pace of potential rate cuts. While some firms are reportedly passing tariff-related costs to consumers, Fed officials remain cautious. Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan noted that the central bank may still need to hold rates steady unless labor markets or inflation weaken further. Still, crypto traders appear to be looking past short-term policy noise. “Despite a temporary setback for the GENIUS Act, Bitcoin has been able to maintain a solid position at around $118,000” said Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research. “We remain positive that the current bull run still has much runway left to see higher prices in the second half of the year.” Read more: U.S. June CPI Rose an In Line 0.3%; Core Rate Slightly Better Than Hoped at 0.2%",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/16/ether-dogecoin-lead-modest-market-gains-bitcoin-holds-118k-as-cpi-print-fuels-rate-cut-bets,"MARKET|BTC|DOGE|TRADING|ETH","Markets|Markets|Ether|Dogecoin|Bitcoin|Inflation|Fed|market analysis|News",cryptocompare

2025-07-16T05:16:46,"SharpLink Pushes Past 310,000 ETH With Latest Buys — What’s Driving the Buying Frenzy?","SharpLink has added to its already massive Ethereum holdings with another multimillion-dollar purchase this week, continuing a buying streak that has turned the sports-tech firm into one of the largest known corporate holders of ETH. On Wednesday, the Nasdaq-listed company purchased 6,377 ETH , worth about $19.56m at current prices. That brings SharpLink’s total to nearly 312,000 ETH, valued at roughly $974m, based on Wednesday’s price of $3,122.98 per coin. The latest buy follows a 24,371 ETH purchase made on July 15, a $73m outlay. Between July 7 and July 13, SharpLink picked up another 74,656 ETH for $213m , averaging $2,852 per coin. SharpLink Buys 10K ETH Directly From Ethereum Foundation In one of the most notable transactions, the company directly acquired 10,000 ETH from the Ethereum Foundation. SharpLink( @SharpLinkGaming ) bought another 6,377 $ETH ($19.56M) today. In the past 7 days, they've accumulated 91,330 $ETH ($275M). https://t.co/8pOfvpDWym pic.twitter.com/NGepBvYcP4 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 16, 2025 Since late May, SharpLink has been accumulating Ethereum in large batches, often moving funds on-chain through major centralized exchanges and over-the-counter addresses. This deliberate strategy suggests a long-term view, possibly tied to expectations of major price moves or upcoming upgrades to the Ethereum protocol. The company’s pivot into Ethereum marks a strategic shift. While it remains focused on its core business in sports betting and iGaming, SharpLink is now using ETH as its primary treasury reserve asset. That decision came after a $425m private placement led by Consensys, with participation from Pantera Capital, Electric Capital and ParaFi Capital. The move was first announced on May 27, 2025. SharpLink Nears Ethereum Foundation in Holdings Size CEO Rob Phythian has framed the acquisitions as a defining moment for public company engagement with crypto. He said over 99% of SharpLink’s Ethereum holdings are staked or restaked in protocols to generate yield while supporting the security of the Ethereum network. Ethereum co-founder and Consensys CEO Joseph Lubin, who now chairs SharpLink’s board, has described the firm’s strategy as a public-market proxy for Ethereum exposure, similar to MicroStrategy’s approach with Bitcoin. Lubin emphasized Ethereum’s importance for decentralized applications and digital commerce, pointing to favorable U.S. legislation as a major tailwind. With its daily buying spree showing no signs of slowing, SharpLink could soon overtake the Ethereum Foundation itself, which currently holds around $725m worth of ETH. The company’s positioning reflects a broader trend, as corporations increasingly look beyond Bitcoin and toward Ethereum as a programmable, yield-bearing asset. Investors are taking notice. SharpLink’s stock was up more than 14% in pre-market trading on Wednesday.

2025-07-16T05:15:17,"Crypto Legislation Faces Delay Amid GOP Disagreements, But New Vote Scheduled for Wednesday","Efforts to advance three major crypto-related bills in the U.S. House hit a roadblock on Tuesday, as internal disagreements among Republican lawmakers forced a pause on a key procedural vote. At the heart of the dispute is a push by some members of the GOP to include a ban on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) in the legislation. House Speaker Mike Johnson said he is hopeful the House will attempt to pass a procedural vote on Wednesday. “It’s a priority of the White House, the Senate and the House to do all of these crypto bills,” he stated, as reported by Politico. Disagreements on Strategy and Bill Structure The package includes the GENIUS Act, aimed at regulating stablecoins, along with the Anti-CBDC Surveillance Act, and the CLARITY Act, which proposes a new market framework for crypto assets. Some Republicans have argued that the bills should be bundled into one, but Speaker Johnson pushed back, warning the Senate would not approve such a move. “We have to do them in succession,” Johnson reportedly said. This legislative push is part of the Republican-led “Crypto Week,” intended to pass meaningful crypto regulation before Congress adjourns for a month-long break in August. In response, Democrats have dubbed the effort “anti-crypto corruption week” to express their opposition. CBDC Concerns Drive Republican Resistance Tensions escalated on Tuesday when 13 Republicans, including House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, voted against considering the bills. Among those dissenting were lawmakers such as Marjorie Taylor Greene, Andy Biggs, and Victoria Spartz. Several lawmakers took to X to clarify that they weren’t opposed to crypto regulations in general, but refused to support the GENIUS Act without an explicit CBDC ban. “I just voted NO on the Rule for the GENIUS Act because it does not include a ban on central bank digital currency and because Speaker Johnson did not allow us to submit amendments,” Greene said. Biggs echoed the sentiment, warning that the current version of the bill could allow for a layered CBDC and lacked guarantees for self-custody. “House Leadership must allow an open amendment process so Members can freely debate and improve the bill,” he added. Past and Future of the GENIUS Act The GENIUS Act had previously failed its first Senate vote in May due to Democratic concerns about Donald Trump’s involvement in crypto. It eventually passed in June with bipartisan support. Custodia Bank CEO Caitlin Long urged calm after Tuesday’s delay, noting that the Senate also required a second vote to move forward on the GENIUS Act. “BEFORE Y’ALL FREAK OUT, don’t forget that the first procedural vote in the Senate on the GENIUS Act failed as well…the second one passed 11 days later,” she wrote on X. Eleanor Terrett, host of the Crypto in America podcast, argued that the current bill already restricts the Federal Reserve from creating a retail CBDC. Speaker Johnson Continues Talks According to ABC News, Speaker Johnson is continuing discussions with Republican holdouts. However, one of the main sticking points remains whether the three bills should be passed together or separately. “They want to push that and merge them together,” Johnson said. “We’re trying to work with the White House and with our Senate partners on this.” The House is scheduled to reconvene on Wednesday to resume its legislative work.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/crypto-legislation-faces-delay-amid-gop-disagreements-but-new-vote-scheduled-for-wednesday/,"REGULATION|FIAT|BTC|MARKET","Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence",cryptocompare

2025-07-16T05:00:29,"Bitcoin Profit-Taking Spikes Without Price Drop – Strong Demand Or Delayed Reaction?","Bitcoin’s (BTC) on-chain activity has accelerated over the past few days, with the leading cryptocurrency by market cap hitting successive new all-time highs (ATHs). As a result, several metrics now indicate renewed interest from both long-term holders and recent participants. Older Bitcoin Moves Amidst High Profit-Taking According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Kripto Mevsimi, Bitcoin’s Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) has surged significantly over the past week. The metric climbed to 28 million, signalling that older BTC – dormant for extended periods – has begun moving again. For the uninitiated, Bitcoin CDD measures the movement of older coins by multiplying the number of coins moved by how long they were held. A spike in CDD indicates that long-dormant Bitcoin is being spent or transferred, often signaling strategic shifts by long-term holders. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Ahead? DXY Breakdown Suggests Capital Shift To Risk-On Assets Historical data shows that CDD spikes typically precede strategic shifts – often large holders either redistributing supply or repositioning portfolios. Such activity commonly appears near cycle midpoints or local tops. Besides the rising CDD, Bitcoin Net Realized Profit and Loss (NRPL) has also recorded a steep climb. The metric recently surged past $4 billion, the highest level since Q2 2025. To explain, Bitcoin NRPL measures the difference between the price at which coins were bought and the price at which they are sold or moved on-chain. A high positive NRPL indicates investors are realizing profits, while a negative NRPL suggests widespread selling at a loss, often tied to market fear or capitulation. As NRPL hits levels not seen since early Q2 2025, it suggests that Bitcoin whales and recent buyers are actively taking profits. Despite the increased profit-taking, BTC’s price has remained relatively stable, trading between $116,000 and $120,000. The lack of a sharp price pullback amid such profit-taking points to two possible scenarios – either demand remains strong enough to absorb sell pressure, or a delayed correction could be on the horizon. The analyst noted: Interestingly, this current wave differs from late June. Back then, NRPL showed a mix of realized losses and modest profits – suggesting capitulation from late buyers while older holders quietly accumulated. Today, the narrative flips: profits dominate, while older coins flow. Exchange Data Suggests Warning For BTC While the absence of a sharp decline despite significant realized profits may signal strong underlying demand, recent exchange data raises some concerns. Notably, Bitcoin inflows to crypto exchanges have seen a sharp uptick. Related Reading: Bitcoin Absorbs Strong Selling Pressure On Binance Derivatives – Breakout Ahead? Conversely, other sentiment-tracking indicators suggest that despite BTC’s new highs, retail hype remains subdued – unlike in previous ATH phases – implying potential for further upside. At press time, BTC trades at $116,760, down 2.6% in the past 24 hours.

2025-07-16T05:00:16,"BlockDAG’s $0.0016 Countdown Is On Before GLOBAL LAUNCH Release, As Pi Network Holds and ICP’s Caffeine Launch Stirs Buzz","The Pi network price has dropped from $0.52 to about $0.45 but remains steady above a key support zone. This sideways move has people wondering if it’s gathering strength. A push past $0.60 could flip the story, hinting at a run toward $1. Meanwhile, new ICP news shows Internet Computer climbing nearly 4% just before launching its Caffeine platform, which could change how people build Web3 apps. BlockDAG is drawing more eyes as its GLOBAL LAUNCH release date gets closer. The presale price of $0.0016 is still live, but not for long. While Pi holds its ground and ICP builds slowly, BlockDAG ’s presale has already crossed $339 million, with 23.9 billion coins sold. Some are already calling it one of the next top crypto gainers, especially if the $1 prediction becomes a reality. What’s Next for Pi Network Price After Recent Drop? The Pi network price recently fell to $0.45 from a high of $0.52, but it hasn’t broken below $0.40. That’s a level analysts say is important. With 276 million PI coins unlocked between late June and mid-July, pressure remains. Still, lower volume hints that the worst may be over. Dr. Altcoin believes that if supply levels off by August, Pi network price could begin a recovery. A move above $0.60 might push it toward $1. In the background, developers are still building real-world tools that could boost long-term relevance. ICP News Highlights Caffeine’s Launch and Market Reaction The latest ICP news reveals a 4% price jump, putting Internet Computer at $5.48 just as it prepares to release its Caffeine platform. This AI-driven tool will let users create Web3 apps by simply explaining what they want in plain language. That request is turned into working smart contracts, launched directly on the blockchain. ICP news outlets report strong volume and higher lows, suggesting momentum is building. With the July 15 launch in San Francisco approaching, this could be one of the more notable shifts in the Web3 space right now. BlockDAG Builds Pressure Ahead of GLOBAL LAUNCH Release The clock is ticking on BlockDAG’s limited $0.0016 presale as its GLOBAL LAUNCH release approaches on August 11. Demand is rising quickly, with more people trying to secure coins before the price moves up. So far, BlockDAG has raised more than $339 million and sold over 23.9 billion coins across 29 batches. The price has climbed 2,660% since batch one, starting at $0.001 and now sitting at $0.0276, yet the $0.0016 offer remains available for a short time. Analysts note that confidence in BDAG comes from its hybrid design, combining Bitcoin’s Proof of Work security with the scale of Directed Acyclic Graph technology. Its growing community is also hard to ignore, with more than two million people using the mobile miner and over 200,000 unique holders. These signs, paired with the size of the presale, have led to talk that BDAG could reach $1 in the months after launch. Now showing up in talk around the top crypto gainers, BlockDAG’s rising demand and tight supply have made the current price feel more urgent. The $0.0016 point may not last much longer, and with its mix of traction and tools, the project is drawing attention for all the right reasons. Final Takeaway These three names are all moving, but in different ways. The Pi network price is holding steady under pressure, and many are waiting to see if that support can lead to recovery. The latest ICP news reflects steady progress, especially with Caffeine adding momentum to Internet Computer’s platform. BlockDAG, on the other hand, is moving quickly. With the GLOBAL LAUNCH release now just weeks away and the $0.0016 entry window closing fast, it has already pulled in major attention. If things play out as predicted, BlockDAG could be one of the top crypto gainers this cycle. And once that window shuts, it may not reopen.

2025-07-16T04:47:38,"Polymarket Odds on Jerome Powell's Ouster Jumps as Congresswoman Says It's 'Imminent'","A Florida Congresswoman's post on X has moved the market for bettors looking to speculate on the firing of Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell. Anna Paulina Luna (R- Florida) claimed on the social media site that Powell's firing was 'imminent', but provided no further details, moving the 'yes' side of a related contract on Polymarket by 4 % up to 27%. Luna does not serve on the House Financial Services Committee , which oversees the Federal Reserve. The Florida 13th district representative serves on the House Oversight and Accountability Committee and Natural Resources Committee, and is a member of the House Freedom Caucus and Congressional Second Amendment Caucus. President Trump has long wished to remove Jerome Powell, dating back to his first administration , but there would be significant legal challenges to removing him. In 2019, the Brookings Institution prepared an analysis highlighting the 1935 Supreme Court case Humphreys' Executor v. United States , which blocked President Franklin Roosevelt from removing an FTC commissioner, as a key precedent supporting the Federal Reserve Act’s “for cause” removal protections. The law, as it stands, only permits the removal of Fed governors only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office, not policy disagreements. And perhaps that has resonated with Polymarket bettors. In the hours since Rep. Luna's post on X, the odds on the 'Yes' side have come back down to 25%. Bitcoin traders dismissed the possibility entirely of Powell's removal, with BTC staying flat.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/07/16/polymarket-odds-on-jerome-powells-ouster-jumps-as-congresswoman-says-its-imminent,"REGULATION|FIAT|BTC|MARKET","Policy|Jerome Powell|Donald Trump|Federal Reserve|Polymarket|News",cryptocompare
2025-07-16T04:45:27,"14-Year Dormant Wallet Dumps 20K BTC, Stoking Correction Worries","A Bitcoin (BTC) wallet holding over 80,000 BTC, untouched for more than 14 years, has sprung to life, liquidating 20,000 BTC worth $2.4 billion and transferring billions more to institutional custodian Galaxy Digital. The sudden movement of these ancient coins, originating from Bitcoin’s earliest days, has sent ripples of anxiety through the market, drawing stark parallels to the Mt. Gox trustee wallet reactivations in 2024 that preceded a brutal 31% BTC price correction. Strategic Moves from a Bitcoin Pioneer According to Lookonchain, the Bitcoin OG controlled eight wallets. Two received 20,000 BTC on April 2, 2011, while the other six received 60,009 BTC on May 4, 2011. Four addresses woke up on July 4, 2025, transferring 40,000 BTC. Several hours later, the other wallets also stirred to life, moving 20,000 BTC, priced at about $2.17 billion, to a new location. Then, on July 14, after a short period of quiet, the ancient hodler moved 40,009 BTC worth some $4.68 billion to Galaxy Digital, over several hours, with the platform funneling some of these funds directly into Binance and Bybit. It confirmed the whale’s intention to at least sell portions of the stash, moving beyond initial speculation about mere wallet consolidation or security upgrades. Given the sheer scale of the transactions, pseudonymous CryptoQuant analyst OnChainSchool has compared them to the Mt. Gox wallet reactivations in 2024. When the defunct exchange’s trustee began moving BTC last year, it caused the flagship cryptocurrency to lose 31% of its value in the weeks following the dump, and more than six months to recover. The current whale activity shares a few similarities: massive volume, long dormancy, and action near an ATH, fueling speculation that it could trigger a similar correction. “So far, only a portion of the holdings has been sold,” wrote OnChainSchool. “Whether the outcome will be similar this time remains uncertain, but the parallels are worth noting.” Market Jitters vs. Historical Context However, there are also a few key differences. For one, this sell-off is being managed professionally via Galaxy Digital, suggesting a more controlled distribution. Furthermore, according to investor Daan Crypto Trades, such events often generate exaggerated fears that tend to dissipate way before the actual selling concludes. The trader also referenced the sale last summer by the German government of 50,000 BTC for about $2.5 billion, where the market absorbed the pressure over time. While the historic wallet’s potential overhang is up to 80,000 BTC, valued at around $9.46 billion, the institutional and OTC demand right now is arguably stronger than it was last year, giving a glimmer of hope that the supply can be absorbed without ruffling the market too much. Meanwhile, Bitcoin, which celebrated a new all-time high of over $123,000 on Monday, per CoinMarketCap, has retraced a bit. At the time of this writing, the asset was trading around $117,500, reflecting a 4% since the peak. The dip interrupts a commendable weekly performance that saw its value jump 7.5% and a monthly gain of more than 11%.
