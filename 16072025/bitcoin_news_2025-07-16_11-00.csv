2025-07-16T08:40:27,"Meta AI: Critical Security Bug Resolved, Safeguarding User Prompts","BitcoinWorld Meta AI: Critical Security Bug Resolved, Safeguarding User Prompts In the rapidly evolving digital landscape, where the promise of artificial intelligence (AI) converges with the foundational principles of blockchain and decentralization, the security of our digital interactions is paramount. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and tech-savvy individuals, understanding the vulnerabilities within cutting-edge AI platforms like Meta AI is crucial, especially when it concerns the privacy of personal data. Recently, Meta addressed a significant security flaw in its AI chatbot, a fix that underscores the ongoing battle to protect user information in the age of generative AI. Unpacking the Meta AI Vulnerability: What Happened to User Prompts? The core of this security incident revolved around a flaw that allowed unauthorized access to users’ private AI prompts and their generated responses. Sandeep Hodkasia, the astute founder of security testing firm Appsecure, was the one to unearth this critical vulnerability. He exclusively shared his findings with Bitcoin World, detailing how he privately disclosed the bug to Meta on December 26, 2024. For his diligent work and responsible disclosure, Meta paid him a substantial $10,000 in a bug bounty reward. Hodkasia’s discovery stemmed from his meticulous examination of how Meta AI enables logged-in users to edit their AI prompts to regenerate text and images. He found that when a user modified their prompt, Meta’s back-end servers would assign a unique, numerical identifier to both the prompt and its AI-generated response. The critical flaw emerged when Hodkasia analyzed the network traffic in his browser during a prompt edit. He realized he could manipulate this unique number, and Meta’s servers, without proper verification, would return the prompt and AI-generated response of an entirely different user. This meant Meta’s servers were failing to perform a fundamental security check: ensuring that the user requesting the prompt and its response was actually authorized to view it. Hodkasia noted that these prompt numbers were “easily guessable,” posing a significant risk. A malicious actor could potentially scrape vast amounts of users’ original prompts and their AI-generated content by rapidly iterating through these numbers using automated tools, compromising the privacy of countless individuals. The Indispensable Role of Bug Bounty Programs: A Shield for Innovation Meta’s swift response and the subsequent $10,000 payout to Sandeep Hodkasia highlight the critical importance of bug bounty programs in today’s digital security landscape. These programs incentivize ethical hackers and security researchers to identify and responsibly disclose vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by malicious actors. Instead of waiting for a breach to occur, companies proactively invite experts to test their systems, turning potential adversaries into allies. Key Benefits of Bug Bounty Programs: Proactive Security: They allow companies to identify and fix vulnerabilities before they are publicly exploited, significantly reducing the risk of data breaches and reputational damage. Diverse Expertise: By opening their systems to a global community of security researchers, companies gain access to a vast pool of diverse skills and perspectives, often uncovering issues that internal teams might miss. Cost-Effective: While bounties can be substantial, they are often far less costly than recovering from a major security breach, which can involve significant financial penalties, legal fees, and customer churn. Enhanced Trust: Publicly acknowledging and rewarding researchers for their findings builds trust with users and demonstrates a company’s commitment to security and transparency. In this instance, Meta confirmed to Bitcoin World that they fixed the bug in January 2025 and, crucially, “found no evidence of abuse and rewarded the researcher,” as stated by Meta spokesperson Ryan Daniels. This outcome underscores the success of the bug bounty model: a vulnerability was identified, responsibly disclosed, patched, and users remained safe. Navigating Data Privacy in the AI Frontier: Why It Matters More Than Ever The news of this Meta AI bug comes at a pivotal time when tech giants are intensely competing to launch and refine their AI products. However, this rapid innovation often runs parallel to significant security and data privacy risks. AI models, by their very nature, process immense volumes of data, much of which can be highly personal or sensitive. Ensuring the privacy and security of this data is a monumental challenge. Meta AI’s standalone app, which debuted to compete with rivals like ChatGPT, faced a rocky start earlier, with some users inadvertently sharing what they believed were private conversations with the chatbot. This incident, combined with the recently patched prompt leakage bug, highlights a broader industry challenge: balancing the excitement of AI’s capabilities with the fundamental right to privacy. Challenges in AI Data Privacy: Data Volume and Diversity: AI models ingest vast and varied datasets, making it complex to track and secure every piece of information. Inference Risks: AI can infer sensitive attributes about individuals even from seemingly innocuous data, creating new privacy concerns. Model Memorization: Large language models can sometimes “memorize” parts of their training data, potentially regurgitating private information if not properly handled. Prompt Engineering Exposure: As seen with Meta AI, the very input users provide to AI can be sensitive, making prompt security paramount. For platforms building on decentralized principles, like many in the crypto space, the emphasis on user control and transparency serves as a strong counterpoint to these centralized AI challenges. The incident with Meta AI serves as a stark reminder that robust privacy-by-design principles must be integrated into every stage of AI development, not as an afterthought. Protecting Your User Prompts : A New Frontier of Digital Assets? While a simple text input, a “user prompt” to an AI chatbot can contain a wealth of personal, creative, or even proprietary information. Imagine a user brainstorming a new business idea, drafting sensitive emails, or even generating creative content for a novel. The leakage of such user prompts could lead to intellectual property theft, reputational damage, or the exposure of private thoughts and plans. In the context of generative AI, prompts are not merely inputs; they are often the genesis of unique outputs, making their privacy as critical as the privacy of personal messages or financial data. This incident prompts users to consider their interactions with AI platforms with a heightened sense of awareness. Actionable Insights for AI Users: Be Mindful of Sensitive Information: Avoid inputting highly personal, financial, or confidential company data into public AI chatbots. Understand Platform Privacy Policies: Take the time to read how AI services handle your data, prompts, and generated content. Utilize Secure Channels: For sensitive AI-driven tasks, explore enterprise-grade or privacy-focused AI solutions that offer stronger data protection. Regularly Review Settings: Check privacy and security settings on your AI accounts to ensure they align with your preferences. The concept of a prompt as a valuable, protectable asset is gaining traction, especially as AI becomes more integral to creative and professional workflows. This incident underscores the need for both platforms and users to treat prompts with the same care afforded to other forms of digital intellectual property. Strengthening AI Security : The Path Forward for a Safer Digital World The Meta AI bug fix is a testament to the continuous and often challenging work required to maintain robust AI security in a rapidly advancing technological landscape. As AI systems become more complex and deeply integrated into our daily lives, the potential attack surface expands, demanding constant vigilance and innovative security measures. The lessons learned from this incident extend beyond Meta. They serve as a crucial reminder for all AI developers and deployers to prioritize security and privacy from the ground up. This includes implementing rigorous authorization checks, employing robust encryption, conducting regular security audits, and fostering strong relationships with the cybersecurity research community through initiatives like bug bounty programs. For the broader tech community, especially those within the blockchain and cryptocurrency spheres, the emphasis on transparent, auditable, and secure systems resonates deeply. The future of AI hinges not just on its intelligence and capabilities, but fundamentally on the trust users place in its security and ethical operation. As AI continues to evolve, so too must our commitment to safeguarding the digital integrity and privacy of every user. The resolution of this critical Meta AI bug underscores the relentless effort required to secure our digital future. It highlights the invaluable role of ethical hackers and robust bug bounty programs in protecting user data. As AI continues to reshape our world, the ongoing commitment to privacy and security will be paramount for fostering trust and ensuring responsible innovation.

2025-07-16T08:30:24,"Bitcoin: Unwavering Accumulation by Long-Term Holders Amidst Market Swings","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin: Unwavering Accumulation by Long-Term Holders Amidst Market Swings In the often-turbulent world of cryptocurrency, where market sentiment can shift on a dime and price charts resemble roller coasters, a fascinating trend has emerged that speaks volumes about conviction: long-term Bitcoin holders are not just holding; they’re aggressively accumulating. This quiet but powerful movement of Bitcoin accumulation by seasoned investors offers a compelling counter-narrative to the prevailing market uncertainty. Why are Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Defying Market Gravity? July 2023 was a period marked by considerable apprehension across financial markets, and Bitcoin was no exception, seeing its price hover around the $30,000 mark after a period of volatility. Yet, amidst this backdrop, a remarkable statistic from CryptoQuant, highlighted by CryptoPotato, revealed that wallets traditionally associated with never-selling — often referred to as ‘HODLers’ — added an astonishing 248,000 BTC to their holdings. This figure isn’t just significant; it’s far above the monthly average, underscoring an unwavering belief in Bitcoin’s intrinsic value and future potential. This phenomenon isn’t new, but its intensity during a period of perceived weakness is particularly telling. It suggests that a core group of investors views price dips not as a reason to panic sell, but as opportune moments to acquire more. This behavior stands in stark contrast to the often-fickle nature of short-term trading, where fear and greed dictate immediate actions. For these dedicated investors, Bitcoin isn’t merely a speculative asset; it’s a foundational store of value, a hedge against inflation, and a decentralized digital future. What Drives This Remarkable Bitcoin Accumulation Trend? The motivations behind such robust Bitcoin accumulation are multi-faceted, rooted in both macro-economic outlooks and Bitcoin’s unique properties. Several key factors contribute to this long-term conviction: Digital Gold Narrative: Many view Bitcoin as the modern equivalent of gold, a finite asset that serves as a hedge against currency debasement and economic instability. In times of global uncertainty, the appeal of a decentralized, immutable asset grows stronger. Halving Event Anticipation: With the next Bitcoin halving event on the horizon (expected in 2024), which historically precedes significant bull runs due to reduced supply, long-term holders are strategically positioning themselves to capitalize on potential future price appreciation. Growing Institutional Interest: Despite market fluctuations, institutional adoption continues to slowly but steadily increase. The prospect of Bitcoin ETFs and growing corporate interest validates Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, drawing in more serious capital. Technological Resilience: Bitcoin’s network has proven incredibly robust over more than a decade, with no downtime and increasing security. This reliability builds confidence among those looking for long-term investments. This strategic patience highlights a divergence in market philosophy. While day traders focus on short-term gains and losses, long-term holders are playing a different game, one focused on the fundamental value proposition of a decentralized, scarce digital asset. How Does This Impact Overall BTC Price Analysis ? The consistent and significant accumulation by long-term holders has profound implications for BTC price analysis , even if its immediate effects aren’t always visible. Here’s why this trend matters: Reduced Circulating Supply: When Bitcoin moves into long-term holding wallets, it effectively removes that supply from active circulation. This creates a supply shock over time, meaning fewer Bitcoins are available for sale on exchanges. Establishing a Price Floor: Strong accumulation during price dips can act as a natural buying pressure, potentially setting a more robust price floor for Bitcoin. It suggests that there’s significant demand at lower price levels, limiting downside risk. Indicator of Fundamental Strength: This behavior is a strong vote of confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term viability. It suggests that despite bearish short-term narratives or macro headwinds, a significant portion of the market believes in its ultimate success, which can influence broader sentiment over time. While accumulation alone doesn’t guarantee immediate parabolic price moves, it lays the groundwork for sustainable growth. It signifies that the asset is being held by conviction, rather than speculation, which is a healthier foundation for any market. Decoding the Current Crypto Market Sentiment : A Tale of Two Traders? The July accumulation trend paints a vivid picture of conflicting forces shaping current crypto market sentiment . On one side, we observe the steadfast conviction of long-term holders; on the other, the apprehension of some large traders and short-term speculators. This divergence creates a nuanced market environment: Metric Long-Term Holders (HODLers) Short-Term Traders / Large Bearish Traders Primary Goal Wealth preservation, long-term growth Short-term profit, capitalizing on volatility Reaction to Dips Accumulation (buying more) Selling (cutting losses, taking profits) Market View Fundamentally bullish Technically driven, often bearish in dips Impact on Supply Reduces circulating supply Increases circulating supply (selling pressure) This ‘tale of two traders’ highlights the maturity of the Bitcoin market. It’s no longer just a playground for quick gains; it’s a battleground of philosophies. Understanding this dynamic is crucial for investors navigating the mixed signals and deciding their own strategy. Embracing the Bitcoin HODL Strategy: Is it for You? The consistent success of long-term holders often prompts the question: should I adopt a Bitcoin HODL strategy? For many, the answer is a resounding yes, provided they understand its nuances and have the right mindset. HODLing, a deliberate misspelling of ‘hold,’ signifies a strategy of buying and holding Bitcoin for extended periods, regardless of short-term price fluctuations. Benefits of HODLing: Compounding Gains: Over long periods, Bitcoin’s historical performance suggests significant potential for compounding returns, far outweighing short-term trading gains for many. Reduced Stress: HODLing eliminates the constant stress of day trading, market timing, and emotional decision-making driven by volatility. Lower Transaction Costs: Fewer trades mean fewer fees, maximizing your capital. Alignment with Fundamentals: It allows you to invest based on Bitcoin’s core value proposition rather than fleeting market sentiment. Challenges of HODLing: Patience is Key: You must be prepared to weather significant bear markets and periods of stagnation. Psychological Resilience: Seeing your portfolio drop by 50% or more requires immense mental fortitude to avoid panic selling. Opportunity Cost: While holding, you might miss out on other short-term opportunities, though this is often offset by long-term gains. For those considering this path, actionable insights include dollar-cost averaging (DCA) – investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price – and only investing capital you can afford to lose. Research, conviction, and a long-term perspective are your best allies. The Enduring Power of Conviction The remarkable Bitcoin accumulation by long-term holders in July 2023 serves as a powerful testament to the enduring belief in Bitcoin’s future. While the broader market may grapple with uncertainty and mixed signals, a significant segment of the investor base is doubling down on their conviction, viewing dips as opportunities rather than threats. This unwavering commitment not only strengthens Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition but also sets the stage for its potential long-term growth. It’s a reminder that in the volatile world of crypto, sometimes the most strategic move is simply to hold, and even better, to accumulate.

2025-07-16T08:27:48,"Bitcoin (BTC) Whales Break Silence: Is a Mid-Cycle Pivot Imminent?","Bitcoin’s (BTC) rally hit a pause as prices slipped 4% from all-time highs, in a typical pullback during a bull market. Its on-chain signals are now flashing a possible market pivot as whales become active and dormant supply begins flowing again in July. Dormant Coins Flow, Whales Strike In its latest analysis, CryptoQuant revealed that Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) surged to 28 million this week, which indicates older Bitcoin previously held inactive is now being transferred. This pattern is historically tied to large holders repositioning near cycle midpoints or local tops. In addition to this, Net Realized Profit and Loss (NRPL) also spiked above $4 billion in realized profits, the highest since early Q2. Such a trend reflected significant profit-taking by whales and recent buyers while Bitcoin’s price hovers around $117,000-$120,000. The price action amid heavy realized profits suggests “resilient underlying demand or a delayed reaction.” Interestingly, this wave contrasts with late June, when NRPL data showed realized losses and modest profits. It hints at capitulation by late entrants while long-term holders accumulated quietly. The current environment flips this narrative: profits now dominate while older coins flow into the market, which aligns with Q3’s institutional rebalancing phase. It also indicates that these movements are strategic rather than random. Previously, simultaneous spikes in NRPL and CDD have preceded periods of volatility, including local tops, consolidations, or mid-cycle pauses, which means that whales and large players are coordinating activity. Whether this leads to further distribution or an extended rally will depend on follow-through in the coming weeks. But for now, whales are active, profits are being locked in, and dormant supply is re-entering circulation. CryptoQuant stated that the market may stand at a hidden inflection point, layered beneath the surface of stable Bitcoin price action. With whales active and dormant coins re-entering circulation, all eyes are on Bitcoin’s key levels. The recent rally to $124K and the subsequent correction have turned this level into a local top. Key Levels Bitcoin has pulled back after hitting $123,000, a level aligning with the +1 standard deviation of the Short-Term Holder (STH) Realized Price. As such, CryptoQuant stated that the resistance now sits at $124K and $136K, the latter representing the +1 STD of holders with coins less than one month old, a cohort often linked with overbought conditions when the crypto asset approaches this band. On the downside, $113K, which aligns with the +0.5 STD above the STH Realized Price, is emerging as a support during consolidations. Meanwhile, $111K is the average cost basis for new entrants, thereby creating a psychological floor if it corrects further. The most critical level remains $101K, the baseline STH Realized Price, which historically signals medium-term bullish structure and strongholder conviction if the crypto remains above it.

2025-07-16T08:16:17,"Institutional demand and possible rate cut keep Bitcoin above $118k; check forecast","Bitcoin experienced a turbulent Tuesday as the price sank below $116k after hitting an all-time high on Monday. However, the market is currently in a recovery phase, with BTC adding 1% to its value in the last 24 hours to currently trade above $118k. Altcoins, including Ether, XRP, and Dogecoin, also recorded excellent gains in the last few hours as the total cryptocurrency market cap looks set to break above $4 trillion for the first time in history. Spot Bitcoin ETF inflow and possible rate cut push BTC above $118k Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market cap, is up 1% in the last 24 hours and now trades at $118,223. The positive performance came after BTC dropped to $115,627 on Tuesday. The ongoing recovery is fueled by growing institutional demand for Bitcoin products. Data obtained from SoSoValue revealed that U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds reported their ninth consecutive day of total net inflows on Tuesday, with $403 million moving into the funds. As usual, BlackRock’s IBIT led the gains, with net inflows of $416.35 million. In distant second is VanEck’s HODL reporting $19 million in positive flows while Grayscale’s Mini Bitcoin Trust and Bitwise’s BITB also recorded net inflows for the day. In addition to the institutional demand, yesterday’s CPI figures also fanned bullish sentiment across the broader cryptocurrency market. Core CPI rose just 0.1% month-over-month for the fifth straight time, signalling further disinflation. Traders are now predicting a September Fed rate cut following yesterday’s CPI data. Despite Bitcoin’s ongoing rally, analysts are still unsure of a breakout in the medium to long term. In an email, Andrejs Balans, risk manager, YouHodler (an EU-based fintech platform), pointed out that inflation in major economies remains persistently above target, prompting central banks to hold policy rates higher for longer. This tight monetary environment has limited liquidity across risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Balans said: Bitcoin’s market has matured considerably, with improved liquidity and participation by professional trading firms. This evolution has reduced volatility compared to past cycles, a sign of a more resilient market, but also a factor that can dampen large speculative moves. Following significant gains this year, many long-term holders have realized profits, thereby adding to the market’s supply. Without sustained fresh demand, this selling pressure could keep prices range-bound rather than driving a decisive breakout. BTC eyes $120k resistance level The BTC/USD 4-hour chart is bullish and efficient thanks to the cryptocurrency’s rally over the last few days. The coin tapped the 4H Transactional Liquidity (TLQ) level at $116k on Tuesday, prompting a rally above $118k. The technical indicators suggest a sustained rally, which could push BTC towards the $120k resistance level in the near term. The MACD lines remain within the positive zone, while the RSI of 58 shows that the bulls are yet to relinquish control of the market. In the event of an extended rally, BTC could surge past its all-time high of $123k over the next few hours or days. On the downside, failure to build momentum above the Bollinger mid-band of $118,200 could see BTC retest the first major support level at $115k. The bears could retest the second major support at $112,500 if the bearish trend continues, with an important trendline liquidity within that region.

2025-07-16T08:15:13,"Google AI Summaries Spark Alarming Publisher Traffic Decline","BitcoinWorld Google AI Summaries Spark Alarming Publisher Traffic Decline In the rapidly evolving digital landscape, where the lines between technology and content are increasingly blurred, a significant shift is underway that demands the attention of every digital stakeholder, especially those deeply embedded in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space. Just as AI reshapes trading algorithms and smart contracts, it’s now fundamentally altering how we consume information. The latest development from the tech giant, Google, has sent ripples of concern across the publishing industry: the rollout of Google AI summaries in its popular Discover feed. This move, while seemingly innovative, poses a formidable challenge to news publishers already grappling with a severe publisher traffic decline , raising critical questions about the future of digital content distribution and monetization. Understanding the Shift in Google Discover News For years, Google Discover has served as a vital conduit for news organizations, delivering personalized content directly to users’ smartphones. It’s been a steady source of clicks, even as organic search traffic dwindled. However, the introduction of AI-generated summaries is poised to disrupt this delicate balance. Imagine opening your Google app on iOS or Android, expecting to see a compelling headline from your favorite news source. Instead, you’re greeted by a concise, AI-crafted summary, pulling information from multiple publishers, whose logos appear subtly in the corner. This new format aims to provide quick answers, but it fundamentally alters the user’s interaction with the news. Google’s implementation of these summaries isn’t a full-scale launch yet; it appears to be a test. Users will notice multiple news publishers’ logos in the top-left corner, followed by an AI-generated summary that cites those sources. A crucial disclaimer accompanies these summaries: they are “generated with AI, which can make mistakes.” This acknowledgment highlights the nascent stage of the technology and the potential for inaccuracies, a significant concern for publishers and readers alike. Bitcoin World observed these summaries firsthand across both iOS and Android apps in the U.S., confirming the ongoing rollout. Beyond the direct AI summaries, Google is experimenting with other ways to present Google Discover news . Some stories might feature bullet points summarizing content below the headline, while others are grouped with similar news, providing a broader context. For example, a story about a political development might include links to related articles, offering a more comprehensive view without requiring users to navigate away from the app. While these additions aren’t explicitly flagged as AI-powered, they contribute to a trend of condensing information within the Google ecosystem, further reducing the need for direct website visits. The Alarming Publisher Traffic Decline: Is AI the Culprit? The publishing industry has been vocal about its concerns regarding declining website traffic, and the advent of advanced AI features only amplifies these anxieties. The data paints a stark picture: global search traffic reportedly fell by 15% year-over-year as of June, according to market intelligence firm Similarweb. Even more concerning is the rise in “no-click” searches — instances where users find their answers directly on the search results page without visiting any website. This phenomenon surged from 56% in May 2024, when Google’s AI Overviews launched, to nearly 69% by May 2025. This shift isn’t exclusive to Google. Other AI applications, such as ChatGPT and Perplexity, similarly provide summarized information or chatbot-style interfaces, effectively becoming intermediaries between users and original content sources. For publishers, this means a significant reduction in organic traffic, which dropped from over 2.3 billion visits at its peak in mid-2024 to fewer than 1.7 billion. The core issue is clear: if users can get the gist of a story or an answer to a query directly from Google’s interface, the incentive to click through to the original publisher’s website diminishes drastically, leading directly to a severe publisher traffic decline . How is AI in News Being Embraced (and Feared) by Publishers? Despite the widespread concerns, many publishers are not sitting idly by. Major players like The Wall Street Journal, Yahoo, Bloomberg, and USA Today are actively experimenting with AI in news production and content delivery on their own platforms. These trials range from using AI for content generation and summarization to enhancing personalization and user engagement. Startups are also innovating in this space; for instance, Particle, a news reader, leverages AI not just for summarizing stories but also for allowing users to explore different perspectives or ask follow-up questions for deeper understanding. While these internal AI initiatives aim to keep publishers competitive and relevant, they exist against a backdrop of increasing apprehension. The very tools being adopted internally by some are simultaneously being deployed by platforms like Google in ways that threaten their core business model. The promise of AI for efficiency and enhanced user experience is undeniable, but its implementation by dominant tech platforms creates an existential dilemma for content creators who rely on direct engagement for revenue. Navigating Digital Publishing Challenges in an AI-Dominated World The landscape of digital publishing challenges is becoming increasingly complex. Google’s response to these industry-wide concerns includes initiatives like Offerwall, launched to provide publishers with alternative revenue streams beyond traditional, traffic-dependent advertising. Offerwall, integrated with Google Ad Manager, allows publishers to implement various access methods for their content, such as micropayments, surveys, or even requiring users to watch ads. This offers a glimmer of hope for diversification, but for many, it feels like too little, too late, as traffic losses continue to mount. The fundamental problem remains: the value chain is shifting. Content creators invest heavily in reporting, editing, and producing high-quality journalism, only for that content to be summarized and consumed on platforms that don’t directly contribute to their ad revenue or subscription base. This disintermediation is a profound challenge, forcing publishers to rethink their entire strategy, from content creation to audience engagement and monetization. The question is no longer just about adapting to digital, but adapting to an AI-first digital environment where direct traffic is no longer guaranteed. The Future of News Consumption and Monetization The trend of AI-powered summaries and “no-click” experiences suggests a future where information is increasingly consumed in fragmented, aggregated forms. While Google Discover previously remained a relatively stable source of clicks even as general Google Search traffic declined, the widespread rollout of AI summaries within the Google app could soon change that. This poses a significant threat to one of the last remaining reliable traffic channels for news publishers. For publishers, the path forward involves a multi-pronged approach: continuing to innovate with AI on their own platforms to enhance user experience and content creation, exploring diverse monetization models beyond traditional advertising, and advocating for fair compensation and attribution from major platforms that leverage their content. The battle for direct user engagement is intensifying, and the outcome will determine the sustainability of quality journalism in the age of artificial intelligence. The introduction of Google AI summaries in Discover marks a pivotal moment for the publishing industry. While Google aims to provide users with quicker access to information, this innovation comes at a potentially devastating cost for news publishers who rely on traffic for their very survival. The ongoing publisher traffic decline , exacerbated by features like AI Overviews, highlights the urgent need for new strategies and a re-evaluation of the relationship between tech giants and content creators. As AI in news continues to evolve, addressing these digital publishing challenges will be crucial for the future of informed societies.

2025-07-16T08:07:57,"“Jerome Powell’s Firing Is Imminent,” Claims Florida Rep. Anna Paulina Luna","The post “Jerome Powell’s Firing Is Imminent,” Claims Florida Rep. Anna Paulina Luna appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Since the start of Trump’s tenure, he has been vocal on interest rates , and on many occasions, he has put direct blame on Jerome Powell for acting too late on curbing inflation and reducing interest rates. In this context, a recent post on social media stirred up a wave of speculation that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell could be fired soon, but experts and markets say, not so fast. REP LUNA: 99% SURE JEROME POWELL IS GETTING FIRED Rep. Anna Paulina Luna says she’s “99% sure” Jerome Powell is about to be fired, doubling down after initially claiming she heard the news from “a very serious source.” Source: @realannapaulina https://t.co/s0a3UsDs4D pic.twitter.com/SucAAt8brQ — Mario Nawfal (@MarioNawfal) July 16, 2025 The Spark: A Bold Claim from Congresswoman Luna On July 16, Florida Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, in her X post, said that Powell’s firing is “imminent.” Although she gave no evidence to support her claim, her post was enough to move the needle on Polymarket, a crypto-based betting platform. Odds that Powell would be ousted jumped from 23% to 27%, though they quickly slipped back to 25% as the excitement wore off. Luna isn’t part of the House Financial Services Committee, the group that oversees the Fed, so her statement doesn’t carry much weight in official circles. She’s more known for her role on the Oversight and Natural Resources Committees. I heard from a very credible, bipartisan source, today, that Jerome Powell is considering resigning. This maps with both reports and also the talk in DC. — Pulte (@pulte) July 16, 2025 Notably, Bill Pulte, head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency and known Powell critic, also claimed he’d heard from a “very credible, bipartisan source” that Powell might resign soon, adding weight to Luna’s assertion. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Sandman warned that markets aren’t ready for such a shock. He noted that over 80% of market participants still expect Powell to complete his term, suggesting that investors are largely ignoring the scenario. So, Can Powell Be Fired? Removing the Fed Chair isn’t that simple. The Federal Reserve Act says a Fed governor can only be removed for serious issues like misconduct or failure to do their job, not just because someone disagrees with their policies. A Supreme Court ruling from 1935 (Humphreys’ Executor v. United States) reinforced the Fed’s independence by limiting presidential power to remove agency heads. Under current law, Fed governors can only be dismissed for inefficiency or neglect of duty, not policy disagreements. This legal power has stood the test of time and protects Powell, even under political pressure. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Week Recap: Bitcoin Surges as U.S. Debates Digital Asset Bills , However, President Donald Trump reportedly wanted Powell out during his first term, too, but even he didn’t follow through, likely because of these legal barriers. Meanwhile, interestingly, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed that a formal process to find Powell’s successor has already begun, hinting that a transition may come, just not as suddenly as some suggest. No Impact on Crypto or Stocks While some Polymarket bettors got briefly excited, the broader financial markets didn’t react much. Bitcoin didn’t budge, and the stock market showed no signs of concern. Traders appear confident that Powell’s leadership will remain intact, dismissing Luna’s post as speculative noise rather than a signal of real change. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Speculation stems from direct criticism by political figures like Donald Trump regarding Powell’s handling of interest rates and inflation. Congresswoman Luna’s recent social media post directly fueled these rumors. Can the U.S. President easily fire the Federal Reserve Chair? No, firing the Fed Chair is difficult. The Federal Reserve Act and a 1935 Supreme Court ruling state that a Fed governor can only be removed for serious misconduct or neglect of duty, not simply policy disagreements. What is the official stance on a potential transition for the Fed Chair position? While rumors of a sudden firing are dismissed, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has confirmed that a formal process to find Jerome Powell’s successor has already begun, hinting at a transition, but not an abrupt ousting.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/jerome-powells-firing-is-imminent-claims-florida-rep-anna-paulina-luna/,"MARKET|REGULATION|BUSINESS|FIAT|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare

In an official statement, the exchange said it detected “abnormal movements” tied to a third-party attack and has since identified and contained the vector. All private keys remain secure, and no additional losses are expected. BigONE is working with blockchain security firm SlowMist to track the stolen assets, with fund tracing already underway across Bitcoin, ethereum, Tron, Solana, and BNB Chain, per a release . What Was Stolen? The stolen tokens span across major and minor assets, including: 120 BTC 350 ETH 9.5B SHIB 7.1M USDT (multi-chain) 538,000 DOGE 1,800 SOL 1 WBTC 20,730 XIN 15.7M CELR 25,487 UNI 16,071 LEO BigONE said user balances are safe, and all losses will be covered in full using a combination of internal reserves (BTC, ETH, SOL, USDT, XIN) and external borrowing to restore liquidity for niche tokens. Deposits and trading are expected to resume within hours, but withdrawals will be delayed until further security reinforcements are complete. “We sincerely apologize for the impact this incident may have caused,” the team wrote. “All investigation progress and handling results will be communicated with full transparency.” The incident marks yet another major exchange hack in 2025, pushing total crypto exploit losses beyond $2.1 billion for the year.

2025-07-16T08:00:11,"House Republicans Block Epstein Files Amendment To Landmark Crypto Bill – Details","As the ‘Crypto Week’ begins, House Republicans have blocked an amendment to one of the three landmark digital asset legislations that would have forced the US Department of Justice (DOJ) to release the controversial Epstein files. Democrats Propose Controversial Amendment On Monday, the House of Representatives Committee on Rules voted against a proposed amendment to the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act that would have tied the Jeffrey Epstein case to the crypto bill. News media outlet Axios recently reported that several House Democrats increased efforts to force a House vote that would require Attorney General (AG) Pam Bondi to release the “Epstein files.” For context, the Trump administration recently received heavy criticism over the way the DOJ handled the case. Notably, the DOJ concluded that no “client list” existed and Epstein’s death was a suicide, not murder. According to the report , Democrats were “hoping to take advantage of a blow-up between President Trump and his base over the Epstein files by forcing their GOP colleagues to choose between them.” As a result, Representative Ro Khanna filed an amendment to the GENIUS Act ahead of its markup session by the House Rules Committee, scheduled at the start of the highly anticipated “Crypto Week.” The amendment would have required AG Bondi to “retain, preserve and compile any records or evidence related to any investigation, prosecution or incarceration” of Epstein. Additionally, she would have had to release and publish the records on a publicly available website within 30 days of the crypto bill being signed into law. Similarly, Representative Marc Veasey also vowed to introduce a resolution demanding that the Trump administration release all pertinent files. Despite their efforts’ low chances of advancing to a House floor vote, both lawmakers reportedly hoped “to at least embarrass the GOP in the process.” Rules Committee Focuses On Crypto Regulation On July 14, the House Rules Committee voted 6-5 against Khanna’s amendment, with Republicans affirming that the change was not pertinent to the GENIUS Act, which aims to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, allowing tokens like USDT and USDC to fall under the Federal Reserve rules. The crypto bill, introduced by Senator Bill Hagerty in February, would establish a “safe and pro-growth regulatory framework that will unleash innovation and advance the President’s mission to make America the world capital of crypto.” According to the Tuesday report, Republican Representative Ralph Norman voted with the panel’s four Democrats in favor of attaching the amendment, arguing that “the public’s been asking for it.” Nonetheless, he voted with Republicans against Representative Veasey’s five-page resolution, arguing that the House Rules Committee “isn’t the body to do this.” He reportedly considers that “It will be borne out by the legal authorities and by the public,” saying “We’re talking about crypto, Jim. We’re talking about regulations.” As reported by Bitcoinist, the GENIUS Act passed the Senate’s full vote in mid-June and was sent to the House of Representatives to continue the legislative process. However, House leaders reportedly pushed to merge the GENIUS Act and the CLARITY Act, the landmark structure legislation, to increase the bills’ chances of passing Congress and being sent to US President Donald Trump’s desk before the August recess deadline. Since then, Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott revealed a new timeline for the crypto market structure framework at the end of June, suggesting an effort to keep the bills separate.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/house-republicans-block-epstein-files-amendment-to-landmark-crypto-bill-details/,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB","Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Crypto Bill|Crypto legislation|Crypto Week|Donald Trump|Epstein files|GENIUS Act|House Rules Committee|stablecoin bill|Trump administration|US House of Representatives|US President",cryptocompare
2025-07-16T08:00:07,"Bitcoin Falls Below $117,000 Amid $3.5 Billion Profit-Taking Frenzy","The Bitcoin price has slipped under $117,000 as on-chain data shows the network has observed one of its largest profit realization days of the year. Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Did The Major Share Of Profit-Taking In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the latest trend in the Bitcoin Realized Profit indicator for the short-term holders and long-term holders. The “Realized Profit” measures, as its name suggests, the total amount of profit that the BTC investors are realizing through their transactions. The metric works by going through the transfer history of each coin being sold to see what price it was moved at prior to this. The difference between that previous price and the current selling price denote the amount of profit or loss involved in the sale. Related Reading: Strategy Grabs Another $472M In Bitcoin—Even With Price At ATH Naturally, the sale realizes a gain if the difference is positive. The Realized Profit adds up this value involved in all transactions of the type occurring on the blockchain. Another indicator known as the Realized Loss keeps track of the sales of the opposite type. In the context of the current discussion, the Realized Profit of two specific segments of the sector is of interest: short-term holders (STHs) and long-term holders (LTHs). Investors are divided into these groups based on the basis of holding time. More particularly, holders who have been carrying their coins for 155 days or less are put in the STHs and those who have made it past this threshold are considered LTHs. Below is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in the Realized Profit for the two sides of the Bitcoin market. As displayed in the graph, the Bitcoin Realized Profit has seen spikes for both of these groups during the last 24 hours, implying investors across the market have harvested gains taking advantage of the rally to the new all-time high (ATH) above $123,000. In total, the holders took profits equal to $3.5 billion inside this window, making the profit-taking event one of the largest for the year. Interestingly, the LTHs occupied for a higher share ($1.96 billion or 56%) of the profit realization than the STHs ($1.54 billion or 44%). Generally, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell them. As such, the LTHs with their relatively long holding time are considered to represent the resolute side of the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Returns Under $117,000: Is Social Media FOMO To Blame?

2025-07-16T08:00:00,"Bitlayer's BitVM Bridge Debuts Its Mainnet, Offers Trust-Minimized Bitcoin DeFi","Bitlayer's BitVM Bridge launched its mainnet on Wednesday, enabling bitcoin (BTC) liquidity for decentralized finance through a trust-minimized framework. The bridge keeps users' BTC safe by locking it in the BitVM smart contract that operates under the assumption that at least one honest market participant exists, ready to expose malicious attempts to move funds. This trust-minimized setup starkly contrasts traditional custodians that involve centralized custody or distributed custodianship. ""Over the past year, we've dedicated significant resources to developing the BitVM bridge, and we're thrilled to finally deliver this milestone to the community,"" Bitlayer co-founder, Kevin He said in a press release shared with CoinDesk. ""Post-mainnet deployment, our focus shifts to scaling asset compatibility and deepening integration with additional blockchain networks,"" He added. YBTC, a gateway to BTC DeFi Central to Bitlayer is YBTC, a token that directly represents the user's locked bitcoin. Its value is pegged 1:1 with BTC, and it opens decentralized finance to BTC holders looking to generate additional yield by allowing them to stake, lend, borrow, trade and provide liquidity across multi-chain decentralized exchanges. The token's security stems directly from the transparent and verifiable BitVM smart contract – unlike wrapped BTC (such as WBTC), which relies on a trusted central entity to hold the actual BTC. Note that YBTC is distinct from Bitlayer's native token, BTR, which is used for governance, fees and staking within the ecosystem and is slated to be listed on major centralized exchanges. Front-and-reclaim model Typically, eliminating centralized custodians implies longer waiting times, especially in the case of fraud-proof systems like Bitlayer. Here, while transactions are assumed to be honest, anyone watching can step in to prove if something went wrong. To allow enough time for these crucial security checks, there's a built-in waiting period, typically seven days, during which a fraudulent transaction could be challenged. This can lead to longer withdrawal times. However, Bitlayer employs an innovative ""front-and-reclaim"" model, transferring the waiting period to specialized brokers or third-party liquidity providers. These entities provide the withdrawn BTC from their own funds to users within approximately one hour. Meanwhile, they wait for their original seven-day security period to end before getting their funds back from the smart contract. This approach offers both trustless security and a fast, convenient user experience. ""There is a front mechanism in BitVM bridge design, the pegout user will get their BTC back at bitcoin block time,"" He told CoinDesk. ""The waiting time will be left to the broker(operator)."" Expansive ecosystem Bitlayer is prioritizing integration with the Ethereum mainnet and major layer 2 solutions, as well as exploring Solana and Bitcoin-native layer 2s, such as Lightning Network applications. It has already secured integration with other leading ecosystems, including Sui, Base, Starknet, and Arbitrum, Sonic, Plume Network and Sundial. ""Our goal is to make YBTC universally accessible wherever significant DeFi liquidity exists, enabling bitcoin to flow securely and seamlessly into diverse ecosystems,"" BitLayer's team told CoinDesk. The team added that it plans to establish a security committee, release audit reports and conduct bug bounties and open-source their code, creating a roadmap that positions BitLayer's BitVM Bridge as a crucial piece of infrastructure for BTC's future in DeFi.

While AUSTRAC and ASIC are developing consumer protection measures, the Aussie government is actively working to establish a successful regulatory balance between innovation and stability. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-16T07:30:02,"Vanguard Becomes Largest Institutional Shareholder of MicroStrategy","Vanguard, one of the world’s leading investment firms, has quietly become the largest institutional shareholder of Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy (MSTR), a company widely recognized for using Bitcoin as its main treasury reserve asset. According to data from investment research platform Intel, Vanguard now holds over 20 million shares of MicroStrategy, amounting to around 8% of the company’s outstanding Class A common stock. This significant stake indirectly exposes Vanguard to the more than 200,000 Bitcoin that MicroStrategy keeps on its balance sheet, marking a 26.3% increase in holdings from January to April 2025. This exposure largely comes through Vanguard’s various index and mutual funds, including the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund, which includes MicroStrategy in its broad U.S. equity allocation. Additionally, MicroStrategy is part of multiple Vanguard mutual funds and ETFs tracking mid-cap benchmarks. Vanguard: Reluctant on Bitcoin Despite its growing indirect exposure to Bitcoin through MicroStrategy, Vanguard has maintained its cautious stance on cryptocurrency. The firm has consistently warned clients about the volatility of digital assets and has declined to offer spot Bitcoin ETFs , unlike competitors such as BlackRock. In a Bloomberg TV interview in May, Vanguard CEO Salim Ramji made it clear that the company would not change its approach to cryptocurrencies, stating, “We don’t get caught up in the latest fad, but we’re dependable for the long term.” In another interview with ETF.com, Ramji emphasized that Vanguard is not interested in “making bets on speculative assets like Bitcoin,” highlighting that such moves are inconsistent with the investment philosophy Vanguard has built over five decades. A Byproduct of Passive Investing Vanguard’s unexpected exposure to Bitcoin through its stake in MicroStrategy has brought attention to the realities of passive investing. As Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted, passive index funds require holding all stocks within the index, regardless of the company’s focus or the manager’s personal views on certain assets. Balchunas remarked that Vanguard’s significant exposure to a company deeply tied to Bitcoin highlights how index investing can lead to unintended exposure, adding humorously that this situation proves “God has a sense of humor.” The post Vanguard Becomes Largest Institutional Shareholder of MicroStrategy appeared first on TheCoinrise.com .",thecoinrise,https://thecoinrise.com/vanguard-becomes-largest-institutional-shareholder-of-microstrategy/,"BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION","Finance and Business News|Vanguard crypto|Vanguard MSTR Holdings",cryptocompare

2025-07-16T07:27:54,"Cardano Price Breaks $0.74, Is ADA Headed Toward $0.85 Next?","The post Cardano Price Breaks $0.74, Is ADA Headed Toward $0.85 Next? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Cardano has caught the marketers’ attention after breaching the critical $0.74 resistance level. And is expected to set the stage for a potential breakout toward the next big target at $0.85. This technical move comes amid improving altcoin sector’s strength, with capital rotating out of Bitcoin as the altcoin season index climbed 9.4%. What has favored Cardano’s buzz is that Emurgo unveiled the Cardano Card on July 15. This development allows users to spend ADA globally, earn DeFi-based rewards, and allocate a portion of profits to the Cardano treasury, enhancing the ecosystem’s sustainability. While the network has developments fueling its long-term run, wondering when will Cardano go up? Join me as I decode the Cardano analysis for the short term. ADA Network Activity on the Move? Cardano’s rally is supported by surging on-chain activity. According to Santiment data, active ADA addresses have climbed to 38.5k, marking a streak of a 10-day uptrend. This sharp increase reflects renewed user engagement following the Cardano Card launch and aligns with ADA’s breakout above $0.74. Rising active addresses typically signal organic network growth, often coming before sustained price gains, strengthening the bullish outlook as ADA eyes the $0.85 target. Cardano Price Analysis: At the time of press, ADA is changing hands at $0.7434, marking a 2.17% daily increase. The market cap stands at $26.31 billion, while 24-hour trading volume has dropped by 20.12% to $1.34 billion, suggesting a cooling-off phase following recent gains. As evident from the 4-hour chart, ADA is consolidating just above the Bollinger Band mid-line, which is at 20 SMA at $0.7361, with upper band resistance around $0.7607. The price is forming a bullish continuation pattern, with immediate support between $0.68–$0.70. Talking about Cardano future price , it could target $0.85 in the near term. The RSI at 58.59 indicates there’s still room for upward movement without entering overbought territory. This neutral-to-bullish momentum, paired with fundamental catalysts and altcoin market support, makes a compelling case for further upside. FAQs Is ADA bullish above $0.74? Yes, breaking the $0.74 resistance is a strong bullish signal, suggesting the potential to target $0.85 in the near term. What is Cardano price today? At the time of publication, Cardano is changing hands at $0.7434, with an intraday gain of 2.17%. What levels should traders watch now? Immediate support lies at $0.68–$0.70.

2025-07-16T07:15:07,"Prominent Analyst Katie Stockton Commented on Bitcoin and XRP Price","While Bitcoin's recent record high of over $123,000 has created great excitement in the cryptocurrency markets, Fairlead Strategies founder Katie Stockton predicts that the price could rise to $135,000 in the intermediate term. Appearing on CNBC's “Closing Bell” program, Stockton stated that Bitcoin has emerged strongly from the consolidation process in recent weeks and that this rise may continue, according to technical analysis data. Stockton said that this rise, which came after a pause of approximately seven to eight weeks, indicates the market is regaining strength. The expert, who uses a “measured movement projection” method, particularly after the strong breakout of the $108,300 resistance level, stated that this trend could continue to $135,000. According to Stockton, this level stands out as a “quarterly” target before a corrective phase begins. Related News: JUST IN: Three Major Cryptocurrency Bills Expected to Be Legislated in the USA Stalled: Voting Negative - Here are the Details Technical analysis wasn't limited to Bitcoin. Stockton noted that Ethereum also broke above its 200-day moving average, signaling a positive signal, while Ripple broke out of its triangle formation and moved upward. He stated that this situation presents a positive technical outlook for the cryptocurrency market as a whole. Crypto-related stocks are also experiencing this upward trend. Coinbase shares broke through the upper limit of its long-term “cup and handle” formation, while MicroStrategy shares experienced a short-term breakout. Stockton noted that MicroStrategy, in particular, maintained its long-term upward trend despite its volatile nature and is showing a recent surge. But there are caveats. Stockton noted that the crypto market can occasionally experience vertical price movements, followed by prolonged periods of sideways movement that force investors to wait patiently. *This is not investment advice.

Further, BigONE has claimed that they’ll cover all losses. “All user assets are safe. BigONE will fully bear all the losses. Trading and deposits will resume soon; withdrawals after added security upgrades,” the exchange noted . BigONE is closely working with the SlowMist team to trace the hacker’s addresses and monitor fund movements, the exchange said in an official release. Production Network Was the Main Target The attackers exploited the supply chain vector, gaining access to BigONE’s production infrastructure, according to security firms.

2025-07-16T07:07:48,"Analyst: XRP Will Not Go to $10,000, “Glitches” Don’t Count","In a market flooded with speculation and sensational forecasts, precision and realism are often overlooked. A recent post by crypto analyst JD (@jaydee_757) serves as a reminder that not every dramatic price spike, especially those caused by technical “glitches,” can be taken at face value. He shared a chart analysis of XRP/BTC on the weekly timeframe, presenting a sharp rebuttal to inflated predictions, particularly those suggesting XRP could reach $10,000. According to JD, glitches that momentarily display such values are meaningless and should not be treated as valid price action. $XRP – Awaiting MACD Cross on the weekly for confirmation. And NO, we will NOT go to $10,000 LOL! ""Glitches"" does NOT count LOL! Those $10,000 $XRP influencers should NOT be trusted. They been REKTin you while the REAL PLAYAS in the game made RETIREMENT gains w/in months LOL… pic.twitter.com/61m7UBdNWi — JD (@jaydee_757) July 11, 2025 Glitches Do Not Represent Real Price Action JD aimed at glitches that have displayed XRP at absurdly high prices on certain platforms. These anomalies, while occasionally cited by enthusiasts as signs of future valuation, do not reflect actual market dynamics. In recent years, some XRP supporters have circulated screenshots showing the token briefly displaying values in the thousands and millions . However, these are often due to API errors or data feed bugs on certain trading platforms. While these visuals generate interest and sometimes hope, they do not represent actual liquidity or executed trades. Other experts have criticized those who share false and unrealistic predictions , and glitches contribute to this problem. JD reinforced his stance that influencers who push $10,000 XRP predictions should not be trusted, suggesting that real price appreciation must be rooted in organic market movement, not technical hiccups. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Bullish Signals Beginning to Form The technical chart shared in the post offers a clear picture of XRP’s current position and possible trajectory against Bitcoin. The focus is on three main indicators: Stochastic RSI, RSI, and MACD. Each of these tools is demonstrating a shift in momentum, but confirmation is still pending. The latest weekly candle shows a notable shift in momentum, which JD highlights as a potentially significant signal. Although this move does not guarantee reversal, XRP briefly breached the $3 resistance, and other analysts have predicted that the asset’s next stop could range from $10 to $20 . XRP: Technical Indicators Show Progress The Stochastic RSI has broken above the 20 level, an early sign of a possible upward trend forming. RSI has moved above its moving average, a development JD notes as a positive shift. The MACD, however, has not yet completed a bullish crossover. The chart also revisits the last time these indicators aligned back in late 2024. The previous alignment led to a substantial rally in XRP/BTC, and a similar structure is now forming. Until the MACD confirms the momentum with a crossover above the signal line, the setup remains incomplete. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

I think that’s where a lot of the market’s focus is beginning to shift.” Chronert says Citi maintains a long-term bullish stance on the stock market, viewing pullbacks as golden opportunities. “Expectations for the next five-year earnings growth are as high as we’ve seen. So there’s a lot of burden on beats and raises, particularly out of this growth part of the market, and that’s where we get a little bit unnerved. Our view for this second half is that you’re setting this thing up for volatility dynamics to come into play. You get triggers for pullbacks. But we saw enough conviction in the underlying fundamental circumstances structurally for the S&P 500 in particular that we want to be looking to buy pullbacks.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

As it breaks out of a triangle formation, some analysts suggest that a rally to a new all-time high (ATH) could be around the corner. Related Reading: Top Crypto Exchanges Made $172 Million From TRUMP Memecoin Listing – Report SUI Breaks Out Of Multi-Month Pattern On Tuesday, SUI broke above the $4.00 resistance for the first time since May, hitting a two-month high of $4.10. The altcoin has seen an 81% surge over the past three weeks, recovering from the June retracement and setting up for a rally continuation. Notably, SUI ended its multi-month downtrend at the end of March, breaking above its descending resistance and jumping to its $4.29 high in May. Following the Q2 breakout, the cryptocurrency has been trading within the $2.33-$4.10 range. However, last month’s market pullback sent the token from its key $3.00 mid-range support to its three-month low of $2.22 before the recent recovery. Since then, SUI has reclaimed the mid-range area and skyrocketed toward the range high as Bitcoin’s (BTC) ATH rally leads the market. Over the past 24 hours, SUI has soared nearly 15% from the $3.50 support toward the $4.00 resistance, breaking out of a triangle formation and potentially setting the stage for a massive breakout. Analyst Ali Martinez affirmed that the altcoin’s bullish price action could push its price to a new ATH as it has broken out of a multi-month symmetrical triangle pattern over the past few days and attempts to turn the next key level into support. According to the market watcher, SUI finally broke above the descending resistance after reclaiming the $3.50 area on Monday and could target a 140% move to the $7.60 area if there’s a spike in buying pressure. Similarly, analyst Nebraskangooner highlighted that reclaiming the $4.00 resistance will propel the cryptocurrency to a new ATH. This level has been a crucial support since the Q3 2024 rally and a key resistance area after the early 2025 pullbacks. Is A Double-Digit Rally Coming? Crypto Bullet noted that SUI has entered its Wave 3, which eyes a double-digit target for the cryptocurrency. The analyst previously explained that the altcoin had a “clear 1-5 impulse off the April’s low – higher degree Wave (1),” before entering the corrective Wave 2 between late May and Early June. However, “Wave 2 took longer and went deeper than expected (obviously due to the situation in the Middle East).” After the recent breakout, SUI has entered the long-awaited Wave 3, with a 51% increase so far, and a target above the $10 mark, the analyst detailed. Additionally, he pointed to SUI’s trading pair against Solana (SOL), as the weekly chart “Looks like a breakout is imminent.” The altcoin is currently retesting a crucial resistance level against SOL, which could lead to a breakout to the 0.0470 area. “In the coming weeks, SUI will just crush Solana,” Crypto Bullet forecasted. Related Reading: Unraveling The Bitcoin Boom: Experts Decode Record $123,000 Surge Meanwhile, Crypto Kaleo affirmed that the cryptocurrency has continued its bounce on its trading pair against BTC. At the start of the month, the analyst highlighted that SUI had bounced from its BTC and USD pairs, becoming one of the leading altcoins. “BTC ratio chart looks ready to rip out of the wedge it’s been accumulating in since the beginning of 2025. Up only,” he concluded. As of this writing, SUI is trading at $3.96, a 3% increase in the daily timeframe.

The market operator suffered a supply chain attack, managing to drain $27M. The BigOne exchange, a market with $728M in volumes, suffered a supply chain attack. The SlowMist team accounted for $27M in losses so far. The hacker drained liquidity on four chains – Ethereum, Solana, TRON, and Bitcoin. 🚨SlowMist TI Alert🚨 The exchange @BigONEexchange was exploited due to a supply chain attack and loss exceeds $27 million. The production network was compromised, and the operating logic of account and risk control related servers was modified, enabling the attacker to withdraw… pic.twitter.com/GkxlNIUs6A — SlowMist (@SlowMist_Team) July 16, 2025 No private keys were leaked, but the exchange logic outside its wallets allowed the hacker to withdraw an unlimited balance. The recent unauthorized withdrawal is the most significant attack against BigOne to date. The exchange is ranked at position #91 based on the CoinGecko reliability index, with a trust score of 6/10. The exchange has relatively high volumes, but limited liquidity for some of its trading pairs, with significant slippage potential. The exchange is not among the Tier 1 markets that carry the most traffic. On-chain investigator ZachXBT noted the market has been widely used to launder funds from personal scams. BigOne noted outflows from its main hot wallet The BigOne exchange team immediately identified the suspicious outflows, affecting its main hot wallet. The wallet’s keys are unaffected and the exchange is working toward renewing deposits and withdrawals. The exchange still posted a system upgrade message hours after the exploit. ⚠️ Security Incident: unauthorized access to our hot wallet All user assets are safe. BigONE will fully bear all the losses. Trading and deposits will resume soon; withdrawals after added security upgrades. 🔗 https://t.co/CWCrng2KK8 — BigONE (@BigONEexchange) July 16, 2025 The exchange’s biggest hot wallet , holding over $23M, was last active in the past few hours. The recent outflows affected a series of hot wallets on different chains, including 120 BTC . The hacker holds nearly $4M in ETH and several tokens, though the tokens may not be easily tradable. The hacker also took stablecoins on several networks, as well as SHIB, DOGE, and smaller Ethereum-based tokens. Another $7M is held in TRX tokens on the TRON network. User balances have not been materially affected, and BigOne will use its insurance fund to cover the loss. The exchange currently holds over $91M in crypto assets, based on DeFiLlama data. BigOne mostly trades BTC, ETH, and SOL, with significant markets for LTC and older meme tokens like BONK and DOGE. The exchange was founded in 2017, going through several bull and bear markets already. The market operator started out in mainland China, but later moved due to regulatory restrictions on crypto trading. The long-term presence on the market meant BigOne mostly carried altcoins from previous bull cycles, with few inflows from the latest meme tokens. BigOne renews centralized exchange attacks The BigOne exchange attack follows a series of exploits against decentralized protocols. During the week, the GMX protocol saw an outflow of multiple tokens valued at $42M, before the hacker agreed to return the funds. A classic supply chain attack, causing unauthorized withdrawals, is now a more rare event. Centralized exchanges have not suffered such attacks since KuCoin’s exploit for $275M in 2020. Even the Bybit attack used a wallet vulnerability, instead of the exchange’s account and authorization infrastructure. The recent exploit showed that server vulnerabilities can also be exploited, changing the logic to operate hot wallets. The hackers managed to bypass the account and withdrawal controls, though the outsized transactions were still flagged. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-07-16T06:58:43,"Postgres Revolution: How ParadeDB Unleashes Unprecedented Data Search Amidst the AI Applications Boom","BitcoinWorld Postgres Revolution: How ParadeDB Unleashes Unprecedented Data Search Amidst the AI Applications Boom In the fast-paced world of technology, where artificial intelligence is reshaping industries and demanding unprecedented data capabilities, the underlying infrastructure often determines success. For those deeply invested in the crypto space, understanding robust data solutions is key to navigating volatile markets and complex analytics. This is where an unexpected hero emerges: Postgres , an open-source database management system nearly four decades old, is experiencing an explosive resurgence, driven by its surprising suitability for modern AI Applications . But as demand surges, a critical challenge remains: efficient data search and analytics. Enter ParadeDB, a groundbreaking solution poised to transform how we interact with vast datasets, directly challenging established players like Elasticsearch. Why is Postgres Becoming the Database of Choice for AI Applications ? For decades, Postgres has been a reliable workhorse in the database world, known for its stability, extensibility, and adherence to SQL standards. Its open-source nature fosters a vibrant community and continuous innovation. However, its recent surge in popularity is directly tied to the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence. AI models thrive on structured, reliable data, and Postgres offers a robust foundation for managing this information. Its ability to handle complex queries, support various data types, and integrate with a wide array of tools makes it an ideal backend for many AI-driven systems. As Bitcoin World has reported, industry giants are recognizing this trend, with significant acquisitions like Crunchy Data by Snowflake and Neon by Databricks underscoring Postgres’s strategic importance in the evolving data landscape. How is ParadeDB Revolutionizing Data Search and Analytics? Despite Postgres ‘s undeniable strengths, a significant gap has persisted: native, high-performance full-text search and analytics capabilities. Traditionally, organizations would resort to moving their valuable data to separate systems, such as Elasticsearch, to perform these critical functions. This introduces complexity, latency, and increased costs. ParadeDB is changing this paradigm entirely. As an innovative open-source extension, ParadeDB allows users to perform sophisticated Data Search and analytics directly within their existing Postgres databases. This eliminates the need for cumbersome data transfers, ensuring that data remains secure, consistent, and immediately accessible. ParadeDB seamlessly integrates with popular cloud Postgres offerings like Google Cloud SQL, Azure Postgres, and Amazon RDS, making it accessible to a wide range of enterprises. The Elasticsearch Challenge: Why a New Approach to Data Management Was Needed? For years, Elasticsearch has been the go-to solution for full-text search and analytics, especially for large datasets. Founded in 2012, it built its reputation on powerful search capabilities. However, its fundamental architecture often involves moving data back and forth between a primary database like Postgres and Elasticsearch itself. Philippe Noël, co-founder and CEO of ParadeDB, highlights the inherent issues with this approach. “That breaks all the time,” Noël told Bitcoin World. “The two databases are not meant to work together. There’s a lot of compatibility issues, there’s a lot of latency issues, higher costs, and all of that deteriorates the user experience.” This constant data synchronization can be a nightmare for heavy workloads or applications requiring real-time updates. ParadeDB’s core innovation lies in addressing these pain points by building directly into Postgres, offering a more integrated and efficient solution for comprehensive Data Management . Riding the AI Applications Boom: ParadeDB’s Growth and Future Vision ParadeDB’s journey began in 2023, with its founders, Philippe Noël and Ming Ying, driven by their own frustrations with Postgres search limitations during their first startup, Whist. Recognizing a widespread problem, they focused on developing a robust open-source product first. This strategy quickly paid off. In early 2024, Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba became ParadeDB’s first enterprise customer, a testament to the platform’s immediate value. This pivotal moment propelled ParadeDB into building out its enterprise software, attracting other prominent clients like Modern Treasury, Bilt Rewards, and TCDI. The company recently secured a significant $12 million Series A funding round, led by Craft Ventures with participation from existing investors including Y Combinator. These funds are earmarked for strategic hiring, expanding their current team of four to at least ten employees, and enhancing the platform’s user interface and analytics capabilities. This rapid growth trajectory underscores the immense demand for better Data Search solutions in the age of advanced AI Applications . Seamless Data Management : Real-World Impact and Integration ParadeDB’s approach to Data Management is rooted in simplicity and efficiency. By functioning as a native extension, it eliminates the operational overhead associated with managing separate search infrastructures. This direct integration means developers can leverage their existing Postgres knowledge and tools, streamlining workflows and reducing development time. The success stories from early adopters like Alibaba, Modern Treasury, Bilt Rewards, and TCDI highlight the tangible benefits: improved performance, reduced costs, and a more unified data experience. As Devin Pratt, a research director at IDC, noted to Bitcoin World, the industry is increasingly consolidating around Postgres, with major acquisitions validating its central role. ParadeDB is strategically positioned to capitalize on this trend, offering a compelling alternative to traditional, separate search solutions. “We think building on Postgres is actually a meaningful shift,’” Noël concluded. “Because that’s where the data is, and you can make a meaningful dent in Elasticsearch ’s market share by meeting users where their data is, rather than building something that’s marginally faster or marginally cheaper.” In conclusion, ParadeDB represents a significant leap forward in database technology, particularly for organizations grappling with the demands of modern AI Applications . By empowering Postgres with native, high-performance Data Search and analytics, it offers a powerful, integrated, and cost-effective solution that challenges the status quo established by legacy systems like Elasticsearch . As the world becomes increasingly data-driven, ParadeDB’s innovative approach to Data Management positions it as a key player in the next generation of enterprise infrastructure.

2025-07-16T06:56:36,"Ether Races 6% Against Bitcoin as GENIUS Act Puts Spotlight on Yield-Bearing Stablecoins: Analyst","Ethereum's native token ether (ETH), is gaining ground against bitcoin (BTC), as the impending GENIUS Act is likely to ban yield-bearing stablecoins that promise interest-like returns, according to Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research. The Binance-listed ether-bitcoin ratio, representing ether's BTC-denominated price, rose over 5.96% to 0.02670 on Tuesday, registering its best performance since May 13, according to data source TradingView. The upswing marked a bullish resolution to the multi-week range play and suggests continued ether outperformance ahead. Ether's dollar-denominated price rose over 4%, topping $3,100 for the first time since February. According to Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, the key driver for ether's price surge is seemingly the growing anticipation that the GENIUS Act, or the U.S. stablecoin bill, will pass, restricting U.S. stablecoin issuers from paying interest. ""That would potentially reinforce Ethereum's importance within the digital asset ecosystem,"" Thielen said in a client note shared with CoinDesk. Thielen added that the GENIUS Act has put the spotlight on Ethena's $5 billion synthetic dollar USDe, which achieves delta-hedging or cash and carry arbitrage by shorting perpetual futures equivalent to the amount of ETH received from users as collateral. That's how it generates yield on USDe. The long-prevailing theory is that the shorting operation adds to bearish pressures in the futures market and caps basis, the gap between futures and spot prices. ""Ethena currently represents about 4% of Ethereum’s $26 billion open interest, and by consistently selling futures, it has exerted downward pressure on ETH prices,"" Thielen said. Ethena has already reached out to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to seek clarity on synthetic dollars, such as the USDe. The team reportedly argued that the synthetic dollar functions as a payment instrument rather than a security and falls outside the scope of the GENIUS Act and the STABLE Act, which regulate payment stablecoin issuers. Ethena is headquartered in Lisbon, Portugal, with new dollar inflows primarily coming from outside the U.S. So, it remains to be seen how it fits the evolving regulatory picture in the U.S. ""If Ethena were to comply with the U.S. stablecoin bill, it could be forced to stop buying Ethereum altogether. However, the market may be interpreting this dynamic differently—ENA-USDT continues to rally, supported by rising Ethereum funding rates,"" Thielen said, adding that the USDe is not offered in the U.S. and so Ethena is not at risk. The GENIUS Act, which got the Senate approval in June with bipartisan support, is expected to head for a floor vote in the House by Thursday.

2025-07-16T06:54:07,"Circle Applies to OCC: Reinforcing Control in USDC Reserves","The post Circle Applies to OCC: Reinforcing Control in USDC Reserves appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The stablecoin issuer, Circle Internet Group, applied to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) on June 30 to establish a US trust bank called First National Digital Currency Bank. If OCC approves, the trust bank would oversee the company’s reserves of USDC (its dollar-pegged stablecoin) and offer digital asset custody services to institutional clients. Why Did Circle Apply for National Digital Currency Bank Currently, the BlacRock manages the majority of Circle’s stablecoin reserves, which is not ideal for the company. It makes the stablecoin users susceptible to risks without warranting their safety. Without a strong, trustworthy structure, the company would become vulnerable and would be exposed to legal uncertainties. Additionally, this will result in token collapse and scaling back the adoption rate. So, the company is applying to the National Trust Bank to strengthen its USDC infrastructure. Circle’s Key Objectives with National Digital Currency Bank The National Trust Bank will be managing USDC reserves and tokenized treasuries in Circle while offering on-chain payments under federal oversight. This initiative aims to help Circle meet the requirements in the GENIUS Act. One of Circle’s primary goals is to build an internet financial system that is transparent, efficient, and accessible to all users, ensuring legal compliance. Circle plans to focus on the custody of tokenized assets — stocks and bonds on blockchain rails, rather than cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Amid the global trends of modernizing traditional markets by integrating blockchain technology, Circle is fortifying its blockchain priority to meet the global demand. Has the OCC Application Been Approved? The OCC has not yet approved Circle’s application for a national trust bank charter. The process of reviewing the application includes a public comment period of 30 days before finalizing. Generally, the complete process takes 120 days, examining the necessary documentation, business summary, compliance, requirements of global standards, and outline of the services it aspires to provide. Final Thought With over $62 billion in USDC circulation, Circle is thriving in the global competition of digital assets. The company is actively working to terminate its reliance on a third party to oversee its digital asset reserves while strengthening internal control by minimizing risks and enhancing transparency.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/circle-applies-to-occ-reinforcing-control-in-usdc-reserves/,"USDC|FIAT|BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|BTC","News",cryptocompare

2025-07-16T06:47:53,"Crypto Regulations in Argentina 2025","The post Crypto Regulations in Argentina 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In Argentina, cryptocurrency is treated as a form of digital asset, allowing trading, storage, and usage without major restrictions. To ensure the safe and secure use of crypto, the Argentine federal government has implemented important regulations governing its use, including a VASP license, registration, and strict compliance with AMK and CFT. In 2025, Argentina is actively implementing a regulatory framework for crypto to enhance oversight and align with global standards. Major Crypto Regulations in Argentina 2025 April 14, 2025 – Cepo Cambiario The Argentine government lifted most currency controls, also known as “ cepo cambiario ”, allowing individuals to buy US dollars without restrictions. This deregulation extended to transactions involving cryptocurrency, expanding liberalization of foreign exchange. March 14, 2025- Resolution 1058/2025 The rule was issued by the National Securities Commission (CNV) to establish a mandatory registration system for virtual asset service providers (VASPs). It also seeks to align Argentina with global anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CFT) standards recommended by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The full regulatory framework will take effect on December 31, 2025. The deadline for registration of entities is as follows: Individuals– before July 1, 2025; Legal bodies in Argentina– before August 1, 2025; Foreign legal entities– before September 1, 2025. Timeline of crypto regulations: Date Law/ Regulations Details July 18, 2024 Decree 640/2024 Legal framework for the tokenization of goods March 25, 2024 CNV resolution 994/2024 Mandatory VASP registration with CNV March 25, 2024 UIF Resolution 49/2024 VASPs as UIF reporting entities, AML/CFT obligations March 14, 2024 Law 27,739 VASP registration, AML/CFT, phased compliance deadline December 20, 2023 Decree 70/2023 Legal validity of crypto contracts reaffirmed May 4, 2023 Central bank ban Banks decline to offer crypto services What is the Argentine Government Saying About Crypto? In 2025, the Argentine government took a progressive stance towards cryptocurrency, recognizing it as a digital asset. President Javier Milei’s administration has fostered this environment by initiating new legislation to encourage the growth of the cryptocurrency sector. The government’s key focus is: Allowing regulated use in transactions and contracts of crypto Ensure security and consumer protection within the crypto market Promotion of crypto adoption and investment in digital assets as part of the broader economy. Crypto Tax in Argentina 2025 Important note: Crypto is an intangible property, so holding crypto is not taxed, but profits or income from transactions are taxable, aligning with fiscal modernization efforts. Tax reporting: The Financial year runs from January 1 to December 31, and tax returns are due by June 30 of the following year. Crypto tax can be reported through AFIP’s online tax portal. Tax type Tax rate Tax applicability Capital gains tax (CGT) 15% Profits from selling/ exchanging crypto Income tax 5% to 35% Earnings from mining, staking, and payments Personal property tax 0.25%- 1.25% Year-end value of crypto holdings VAT 21% Crypto is used to buy goods and services International transfers 5% -15% Cross-border crypto transactions. Crypto License in Argentina There are no specific licenses in Argentina for crypto businesses; only the Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) registration is required to operate. The Resolution General 994/2024 defined the VASP, while Ley 277739 specified the regulatory (CNV) and functions of VASPs. All crypto companies must register if their transaction volume exceeds 35,000 UVA (approx $29,246). Exemptions for monthly volume below this threshold are also available. Penalty: Failure to register can result in the disqualification of the crypto platform and cease it from operating. Under Ley 27739, the VASP can engage in: Exchange of virtual assets for fiat currencies. Exchange of one virtual asset for another. Transfer of virtual assets. Custody and management of virtual assets. Financial services related to virtual assets offerings and sales. Crypto Adoption In Argentina User penetration rate: The crypto user penetration is expected to be 22.80% in 2025 and is projected to increase to 23.80% by 2026. The number of users in the crypto market is expected to reach 10.95 million by next year. Crypto revenue: The current projected crypto revenue is estimated to reach US$940.9 million in 2025. As the crypto market is growing rapidly in the region, the estimation for 2026 is growing at a rate of 16.02%, depicting US$1.1 billion crypto revenue by 2026. Crypto holdings: The Argentine government has not disclosed its crypto holdings yet; policies are prioritizing creating a framework for crypto regulations to protect investors and consumers. Conclusion Argentina’s recent policies and the government’s active efforts in the crypto space have promised further exploration of blockchain tokenization and open finance. The country is fully supporting high fintech adoption to balance security with modernization. The primary goal of the government is to establish a better digital framework to boost the economy with cryptocurrency and other digital assets. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

On-chain data analysis shows the Ethereum network has received renewed interest from institutional investors. The odds of altseason 2025 having started are high with Ether price above $3.1k against. Ethereum (ETH) price has soared above $3,140 for the first time in 23 weeks on Wednesday, July 16. The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $378 billion, surged 5.53% in the past 24 hours to trade at about $3,141 on Wednesday during the early European trading session. After having experienced a significant resistance level around $2.6k in the past two months, Ether price has confirmed a successful weekly bullish breakout. The Ether price surge above $3.1k, amid the ongoing Bitcoin (BTC) price discovery, has coincided with a sharp uptick in Ethereum’s Open Interest (OI) above $46 billion for the first time since its inception.

2025-07-16T06:42:54,"Crypto is Going Mainstream and 'You Can’t Put the Genie Back in the Bottle,' Bitwise Says","The U.S. is on the verge of passing landmark crypto legislation, and if it succeeds, the impact could be profound, not only by unlocking growth, but by significantly reducing risk, asset manager Bitwise said in a report on Monday. The growth story is straightforward according to Bitwise. Regulatory clarity would empower major financial institutions, such as JPMorgan (JPM), BNY Mellon (BK), Nasdaq (NDAQ), to fully build in crypto, the report said. That means billions in new investment and a path to migrate trillions of traditional assets onto blockchain rails. The infrastructure is ready; it just needs Washington’s go-ahead, according to the asset manager. This week the House of Representatives is voting on the CLARITY Act, a crypto market structure bill, and the GENIUS Act, which regulates stablecoins in the U.S. Yesterday, the top democrat of the Senate Agriculture committee said the market structure bill needs serious changes . If these bills pass through Congress, ""you can’t put the genie back in the bottle,"" wrote Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise. The deeper, under appreciated shift will be in risk, wrote Hougan. Crypto’s reputation has been battered by collapses including FTX , Terra/Luna , 3AC , Celsius , Mt. Gox. These weren’t just failures of business models; they were failures of oversight. Without clear U.S. regulation, bad actors thrived in offshore shadows, and investors paid the price. Stronger laws wouldn’t have prevented every scandal, but they would’ve stopped many, the report said. Bitwise notes that crypto’s volatility, and previous 70%+ drawdowns, have kept institutions on the sidelines. If legislation eliminates the wildcard risk of offshore implosions, those extreme crashes may become far less frequent. And no, the political winds aren’t likely to reverse, Bitwise said. The GENIUS Act passed the Senate 68–30, with bipartisan support including 18 Democrats. Wall Street wants in, and as major institutions deepen their crypto footprints, political support will only grow. When BlackRock, JPMorgan, and millions of Americans are invested, crypto becomes part of the system, too embedded to ignore, and too integral to unwind, the report added.

2025-07-16T06:42:12,"Crypto Bulls Rejoice: Congresswoman Confirms Powell’s Imminent Firing","A single-word reply on X from Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R‑FL) — “Confirmed” — rocketed through the crypto markets early Wednesday, convincing a growing chorus of traders that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s tenure is measured in days, not months. Within minutes of Luna’s affirmation that “Jerome Powell is going to be fired. Firing is imminent,” prediction‑market odds of his ouster on Polymarket leapt to 26 percent, the highest reading this year, up from 16 percent only 24 hours earlier. A White‑House‑backed search is already under way. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, in an on‑record Bloomberg interview, acknowledged “a formal process that’s already starting” to identify Powell’s successor, adding that “there are a lot of good candidates inside and outside the Federal Reserve.” Related Reading: ‘Crypto Week’ Takes A Hit: US House Fails To Advance Key Acts President Donald Trump underscored the point during an impromptu press gaggle, repeating last week’s warning that “the renovations at the central bank were a fireable offense.” Those renovations — an over‑budget, $2.5 billion overhaul of the Fed’s historic Eccles Building — have become the legal pretext for dismissal, with Trump allies alleging “inefficiency” and “neglect of duty,” two of the three causes for removal spelled out in the Federal Reserve Act. Powell has asked the Fed’s inspector general to reopen its review of the project. Notably, Bill Pulte, the Federal Housing Finance Agency head and a longtime Powell critic, confirmed the rumors to his followers on X: “I heard from a very credible, bipartisan source, today, that Jerome Powell is considering resigning. This maps with both reports and also the talk in DC.” Crypto Markets Sense A Massive Bull Run The Bitcoin and crypto prices haven’t shown any reaction to the rumor yet. After piercing $123,000 on Monday, BTC is still 4.5 percent below the record high. The entire crypto market seems to be in a wait-and-see position. However, long-term, the implication could be profound for the crypto markets. “I cannot think of a more bullish catalyst for Bitcoin in the past five years than the complete and utter humiliation of Jerome Powell,” wrote macro commentator Julian Figueroa, pointing to what he called the “façade” of central‑bank independence collapsing in real time. Related Reading: Happy Ending: Crypto Hacker Returns Funds From $42 Million GMX Exploit Long‑time trader Byzantine General echoed the ambivalence: “Powell was actually a great Fed chair. But… if he resigns then it’s very likely that whoever comes next will lower rates, which is bullish for our cryptographic currencies.” Should President Trump succeed in replacing Powell with a more accommodating successor—one prepared to deliver the “three‑percentage‑point” rate cut he has publicly demanded—the Federal Reserve would likely be forced to shelve its balance‑sheet runoff precisely as Washington ramps up fresh fiscal stimulus. That synchronous pivot away from quantitative tightening would flip the liquidity regime from drain to deluge, recreating the macro backdrop that powered the crypto market’s 2020‑21 vertical ascent and positioning it for the next major bull run. At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $3.68 trillion.

2025-07-16T06:36:40,"How Bitcoin Could Hit $200K on Global Institutional Inflows Alone","“Institutional capital can no longer ignore the returns that Bitcoin is providing,” reported the Kobeissi Letter on Tuesday. The cryptocurrency cannot be ignored because it has yielded a 90% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the past 13 years, which no other asset can match. Even “conservative” funds are allocating 1% of their assets under management to Bitcoin as treasury trend momentum builds, they observed. Massive Institutional Inflows Currently, there is an estimated $31 trillion in institutional AUM in the United States, Kobeissi stated. “If just 1% of US institutional capital flows into Bitcoin, this could drive another $300 billion into the asset,” they said. A further $300 billion added to Bitcoin’s $2.34 trillion market capitalization would drive prices up around 13% which would put the asset at $133,000. This figure has been widely predicted by analysts as a short-term target. “Factor in global institutional AUM, and we could see $1 trillion+ flow into Bitcoin,” they said. Another $1 trillion added to the BTC market cap would drive prices up by 70%, which would put it closer to $200,000. “Bitcoin has simply become too big to ignore.” Bitcoin’s next catalyst has arrived: Simply put, institutional capital can no longer ignore the returns that Bitcoin is providing. When an asset provides a return of 90% in one year, it can be ruled an “outlier.” However, when an asset provides a 90% CAGR for 13 years… — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) July 15, 2025 All this is hypothetically achievable without any retail participation in markets. Institutions are already driving the current market rally. BlackRock , for example, has hoovered up a whopping 717,388 BTC, or 3.6% of the entire circulating supply. Meanwhile, Strategy has accumulated 601,550 BTC, 3% of the circulating supply. These two entities alone hold a whopping 6.6% of the entire Bitcoin supply, currently valued at $155 billion. As more institutional Bitcoin funds are launched, and more corporations and nation states stack the asset for their treasuries, the price can only go one way in the long term. BTC Price Outlook Bitcoin is still cooling from its July 14 all-time high and remains down 4.3% from that level. The asset was trading flat on the day at $117,850 at the time of writing, holding around support levels. It is possible that consolidation could continue for some time before the next leg up into the $130,000 range. The retreat has been caused by long-term holders taking profit , not institutions liquidating their stashes. Glassnode reported that this week saw “one of the largest BTC profit realization days this year, driven mostly by long-term holders.” The post How Bitcoin Could Hit $200K on Global Institutional Inflows Alone appeared first on CryptoPotato .",cryptopotato,https://cryptopotato.com/how-bitcoin-could-hit-200k-on-global-institutional-inflows-alone/,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|REGULATION","AA News|Crypto News|Bitcoin|Bitcoin (BTC) Price",cryptocompare

2025-07-16T06:34:08,"First Bitcoin, Then Ethereum On the Move! Analysts Explain Their Expectations: ""ETH May Be on the Verge of an Unprecedented Rise!""","Bitcoin (BTC) made a major push at the beginning of the week, surpassing $123,000 and breaking a new record. While this rise had limited impact on altcoins, Ethereum (ETH) and other altcoins began to surge as profit-taking began in BTC. Ethereum Goes on the Attack! At this point, Ethereum reclaimed the $3,000 level for the first time since February 1st and reached a 5-month high of $3,150. Analytics firm Swissblock said that one of the key drivers behind Ethereum's rise is the capital rotation from Bitcoin. Analysts noted that Bitcoin's previous four bullish waves this year lasted between 15 and 30 days. They noted that the current rally has reached its 12th day, and that profit-taking may begin in BTC after that. They also noted that capital flowing out of BTC could flow into altcoins, particularly ETH, which could further boost ETH. Analysts also noted that the ETH/BTC ratio broke upwards for the first time since May, signaling a trend reversal. They noted that ETH/BTC had broken above its 200-day moving average for the first time in a year, indicating medium- to long-term upward momentum for ETH. Bullish Predictions for Ethereum Are Increasing! Pseudonymous crypto analyst Merlijn The Trader also argued that Ethereum could experience an unprecedented rally. Accordingly, the analyst claimed that ETH could follow a trajectory similar to Bitcoin's 2018-2021 market cycle. If Ethereum follows BTC's 2018-2021 cycle, it could experience a 1,100% rally. He noted that ETH's current price movements mirror those of BTC between 2028 and 2021, particularly the rates of increase and correction being identical. According to the analyst, ETH could experience the same 1,100% increase as BTC from now on. This means Ethereum could potentially rally to around $18,205. While the analyst's chart suggests a significant rally is imminent for Ethereum, it alone isn't enough to trigger a surge. Don't base your investment decisions on a single piece of data or analysis. These analyses are often fallible and are merely helpful data that has never been proven 100% accurate. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: First Bitcoin, Then Ethereum On the Move!
