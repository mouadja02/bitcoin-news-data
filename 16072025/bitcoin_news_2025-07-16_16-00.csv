2025-07-16T13:57:45,"$235M XRP Futures Frenzy: Smart Money Loading Up?","TL;DR CME XRP futures hit $235M in one day, signaling rising institutional interest and global demand. SEC approves UXRP, the first U.S.-listed leveraged XRP ETF, set to launch on NYSE Arca. 3iQ’s Canadian XRP ETF tops $50M in assets as regulated products gain traction globally. XRP Futures Set New Record on CME CME’s XRP futures market posted its highest trading volume to date on July 11. Over $235 million in notional value changed hands in a single day, with volume spread across standard and micro contracts. This brings the total traded volume since the May 19 launch to over $1.6 billion. The contracts offer exposure to XRP without requiring token ownership. The standard contract is based on 50,000 XRP, while the micro version covers 2,500 coins. These cash-settled products are tied to CME’s XRP-Dollar Reference Rate and are available to both institutions and retail traders. Institutions Turn to Regulated Exposure CME has become a go-to exchange for investors who want access to crypto through regulated markets. Its Bitcoin and Ether futures are already widely used, and XRP is now following a similar path. The latest numbers suggest growing use of XRP futures among trading firms. CME’s Active Trader account posted , “XRP and Micro XRP futures crossed $235M notional traded on July 11.” That day, over 9,100 contracts were traded, equal to more than 82 million XRP. Micro contracts also saw their busiest session since launch. Ripple, which uses XRP for international payments, is applying for a banking license in the United States. It is also looking to register under the MiCA framework in the European Union. These moves are part of a broader strategy to build compliant infrastructure for XRP in major markets. XRP Gets First U.S. ETF as Global Demand Grows XRP futures aren’t the only regulated product gaining traction. On July 14, 3iQ reported that its XRP ETF, trading on Canada’s TSX, crossed $50 million in assets. CME data also shows that 45% of XRP futures volume comes from outside North America, pointing to strong demand across regions. Adding to this institutional wave, the SEC has approved the ProShares Ultra XRP ETF, a leveraged futures-based product set to trade under the ticker UXRP on NYSE Arca. Trading is scheduled to begin by week’s end, giving XRP its first U.S.-listed ETF exposure.

2025-07-16T13:54:27,"Bitcoin ETFs Just Pulled Off a $7.78B Inflow Streak Since July 9th","Bitcoin experienced a typical pullback after hitting a new all-time high above $123K this week, briefly dipping before recovering to $118K on Wednesday. Despite this pause in its rally, strong institutional interest remains clear, as consistent inflows into Bitcoin ETFs continued to support market confidence and the broader bullish momentum. Bitcoin ETFs Are Soaking Up Fiat Market intelligence platform Santiment revealed that there has been a surge of capital moving into Bitcoin ETFs as the top crypto asset trades in new territory. Since June 9, these investment vehicles have recorded a combined net inflow of $7.78 billion, averaging $353.8 million daily. Glassnode also observed that Monday marked one of the largest daily inflows to the spot Bitcoin ETFs in the past three months, with over 7,500 BTC added in a single day. What’s striking is Tuesday’s follow-through, as institutions showed no hesitation, adding another 3,400 BTC or around $402 million in net inflows, despite the previous day’s surge. This also represented nine consecutive days of consistent buying pressure. According to data updated by SoSoValue, BlackRock’s IBIT was the top performer as it captured $416.35 million in net inflows. Next up was VanEck’s HODL, which added $19 million, while Grayscale’s Mini Bitcoin Trust and Bitwise’s BITB also saw $18.56 million and $12.7 million, respectively. This steady influx of fiat into the funds aligns with on-chain whale accumulation, which, according to Santiment, is contributing to Bitcoin’s record-setting all-time high levels and demonstrates the growing appetite for institutional exposure to BTC amid its historic rally. Bitcoin Could Hit $200K on Global Institutional Inflows If global institutional inflows alone enter the market, Bitcoin could rise another 70% to approach $200,000, as per an update by Kobeissi Letter. With Bitcoin delivering a 90% CAGR over the past 13 years, even conservative funds are allocating 1% to BTC as treasury adoption gains momentum. Kobeissi noted that with $31 trillion in institutional AUM in the US, a 1% allocation could inject $300 billion into Bitcoin. This, in turn, could drive prices to around $133,000, a widely cited short-term target. Factoring in global institutional AUM, a $1 trillion inflow could add 70% to Bitcoin’s price, thereby pushing it closer to $200,000, all without retail participation. As more institutional products launch and entities accumulate BTC for treasuries, experts believe that Bitcoin’s upward trajectory will continue.

Total trading volume across the top 10 exchanges reached $21.6 trillion despite declining 6.16%. Binance held a 35.39% market share, while five exchanges posted gains. Crypto market capitalization rebounded to $3.46 trillion, marking 28.2% quarterly growth. Binance maintains dominant position Binance held 35.39% trading volume share in Q2 2025, marking a slight decline from Q1. The exchange dropped 1.18% from the previous quarter’s 36.57% market share. Nevertheless, Binance remained the only exchange consistently capturing over one-third of market share. OKX secured second position with 14.34% market share, posting 1.08% quarter-on-quarter growth. The exchange increased from 13.26% in Q1 2025, showing steady market expansion. Bybit maintained third position with 12.20%, declining 0.80% from the previous quarter. Bitget held 11.45% market share with 0.14% growth from Q1’s 11.31% position. MEXC posted an 11.45% share, declining 1.58% from 13.03% in Q1 2025. Gate achieved the largest market share increase, rising 2.55% to 7.95%. Source: TokenInsight BingX recorded 2.17% market share, a 0.17% decline from Q1 levels. HTX maintained 2.64% share, posting 0.51% growth quarter-on-quarter. Coinbase held 1.06% market share, declining 0.62% from the previous quarter. KuCoin maintained a 1.29% market share with 0.05% growth from its Q1 position. Five exchanges saw market share growth during the Q2 2025 period. Gate led gains followed by OKX with substantial quarter-on-quarter improvements. Total trading volume reached $21.6 trillion across the top 10 exchanges combined. The volume declined 6.16% from Q1 despite Bitcoin’s recovery to $106,000 by the end of the quarter. Market conditions drive trading volume decline Bitcoin rose from $83,000 to peak at $111,900, ending the quarter near $106,000. Most other assets saw limited recovery, with altcoins experiencing sharp liquidity drops. Trading activity declined across many alternative cryptocurrencies during the quarter. Crypto market capitalization rebounded to approximately $3.46 trillion by Q2’s end. The recovery marked a 28.2% quarter-on-quarter increase following Q1’s deep correction. ETF product inflows and Bitcoin rally primarily drove market recovery. Federal Reserve rate cut expectations and improving employment data supported sentiment. However, geopolitical tensions and sluggish global growth limited a broader rebound. Ongoing macro uncertainty and slow regulatory progress weighed on activity. Cautious investor sentiment continued affecting trading volumes across exchanges consistently. For the second consecutive quarter, the market’s volume performance declined. Volumes could stay low in the absence of robust inflows or new policy support. In the first quarter, spot trade volume was $51 billion per day; now, it is $40 billion. Spot trading totaled $3.63 trillion, a 21.7% decrease from $4.6 trillion in Q1. Derivatives trading stats fell 3.6% from the previous quarter to $20.2 trillion. The average daily trade of derivatives decreased from $233 billion to $226 billion. Exchange tokens showed mixed performance Exchange tokens showed mixed performance in Q2 2025 with all major tokens underperforming Bitcoin . Bitcoin gained 31.62% while exchange tokens failed to show similar momentum. BNB recorded the highest gain among exchange tokens at 8.91% quarterly. OKB, BGB, and KCS posted modest increases during the quarter. Most other major exchange tokens experienced declines across the timeframe. Exchange token performance remained closely tied to struggling altcoin market conditions. Bitcoin rallied strongly, backed by spot ETF inflows and regulatory clarity. Exchange tokens failed to benefit from the same institutional momentum. During Q2, there was a noticeable drop in altcoin market trading activity and liquidity. Exchange token performance from TokenInsight In Q2 2025, spot trading share continued to fall on most exchanges. With a 2.70% gain in spot share, MEXC had the biggest growth, followed by Bitget. In the face of uncertainty, traders continued to choose high-frequency derivatives trading in Q1. The goal of trading derivatives was to leverage market volatility and manage risks. The pattern showed that spot markets had a more severe decline than derivatives. Binance maintained its leading open interest position with a 23.83% average market share. The exchange increased 0.36% from Q1’s 23.47% open interest share. HTX, Bitget, and OKX recorded the largest open interest gains at 1.19%, 0.71%, and 0.63%.

2025-07-16T13:45:30,"If XRP ends the week at this level, it will hit a record high of $4.8","Cryptocurrency trading expert Ali Martinez is projecting that XRP could rally to a new all-time high near $5, provided the token secures a decisive weekly close. Martinez noted that XRP is showing renewed strength on the weekly chart, emphasizing that breaching $3 would serve as the key catalyst for a breakout to new highs at $4.9, he said in an X post on July 16. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView The analysis highlighted that XRP has repeatedly tested the $3 mark since early 2025 but has consistently failed to close above it, reinforcing its role as a major resistance level. However, recent price action shows a shift in momentum, with XRP forming higher lows since bottoming near $1.90 in April. The steep rally into mid-July, which saw XRP briefly reclaim $3, suggests strong buying interest, putting the token on the brink of a critical breakout. Now, if buyers can push the price above $3 and hold it through the weekly close, the setup would confirm a bullish continuation, targeting $4.80, which is nearly 60% above current levels. XRP fundamentals Overall, XRP has been on a bullish run in line with broader market sentiment, driven by Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) rally to a record high above $123,000. This momentum has helped XRP reclaim its position as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The rally also follows the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s decision in late June to drop its appeal in the long-running case against Ripple, ending four years of legal uncertainty. Both parties are now exploring a settlement pending court approval. Adding to the optimism, Ripple applied on July 2 for a federal bank charter with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, signaling an ambitious move into regulated financial services. Investor interest is also rising, with eleven asset managers filing for spot XRP ETFs and ProShares launching leveraged products tied to the token. XRP price analysis At press time, XRP was trading at $2.96, up 3% on the day and nearly 24% over the past week. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold The price is well above its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) at $2.29 and 200-day SMA near $1.80, confirming strong bullish momentum. However, with a 14-day RSI of 80.62 signaling extreme overbought conditions, the market risks a short-term pullback that could limit its ability to break and hold above the key $3 level decisively.

2025-07-16T13:44:57,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Bullish Momentum Returns After Recent Correction, Is $140K Next?","Bitcoin is currently trading around $119K after reaching a new all-time high above $123K just days ago. This historic breakout has come with aggressive momentum, flipping prior resistance levels into strong support. The overall structure remains bullish, but recent price action shows early signs of a potential short-term exhaustion. By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart On the daily chart, BTC has respected its macro bullish channel and just broke out from a large bull flag formation that had been developing for several weeks. This continuation pattern came after a steep rally from the April lows around 75K and was followed by a clean breakout above the 108K resistance zone. Once BTC cleared that level, momentum accelerated rapidly, with the price pushing through the key 114K resistance level and tapping $123K, forming new all-time highs. The bullish structure remains intact, with higher highs and higher lows forming clearly. BTC is now sitting below the dotted trendline that marks the midline of the multi-month ascending channel. This midline zone could be the target of this price rally, as the market might reach and test it around $140K. Another critical observation on the daily chart is the confluence between the breakout and the moving averages. The asset is holding well above both the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, which are slowly curving upward. This suggests strong underlying demand and trend continuation. If BTC does retrace, the 110K zone stands out as the primary support block, not only due to recent price memory but also because it aligns with recent major highs. The 4-Hour Chart Zooming in on the 4-hour timeframe, BTC is testing the $118K–$119K bearish fair value gap, which is now acting as resistance. After the sharp rally toward $121K, the price has pulled back modestly, forming a small range just under the bearish FVG. The RSI has also cooled down from overbought levels and now sits around 58, suggesting there’s still room for more upside in the short term. However, the recent rejection from the $123K highs shows that some local resistance is forming. This could lead to short-term distribution unless bulls reclaim this bearish FVG convincingly. Yet, below the current price, several clean bullish FVGs exist, starting at $114K and extending down to $111K. These are prime zones to watch for long setups if BTC dips further. They mark strong, unmitigated demand areas where the price rallied impulsively with little resistance. A drop into these zones, followed by bullish price action (like a sweep and reclaim), would offer high-probability continuation opportunities toward 125K and beyond. Sentiment Analysis Bitcoin Retail Activity Surge One of the most telling on-chain signals right now is the surge in retail trading activity, as measured by the Bitcoin Spot Retail Activity Through Trading Frequency indicator. This metric evaluates the relative increase in retail participation based on changes from the one-year moving average. Historically, surges in this metric, especially when it turns red, have coincided with major pivots, mostly indicating overheated conditions and excessive euphoria. Right now, the chart is not showing red signals, meaning retail participation is still average. This indicates that retail traders and investors are yet to flood the market and chase the price, at least not to the extent that they have during previous all-time highs. This suggests that the price could still rise sustainably if other factors, especially the futures market metrics, remain stable.

2025-07-16T13:43:09,"Arizona, Texas, and Utah Named Blockchain Policy “Trailblazers” in US","Arizona, Texas, and Utah have emerged as leaders in cryptocurrency regulation in the United States, according to the latest “Tokenized in America” report by Chainlink and the Blockchain Association . Key Takeaways: Arizona, Texas, and Utah lead the US in crypto regulation, earning “trailblazer” status. Over half of the US states have strong congressional support for blockchain. State-level momentum builds alongside federal efforts during “Crypto Week.” These states have been recognized as “trailblazers” for their friendly blockchain policies and growing ecosystems. The report assessed states on several factors, including government-led blockchain pilot projects, active pro-crypto task forces, and legislative support. Concentration of blockchain-related workforce, strategic Bitcoin reserve initiatives, and membership in the North American Blockchain Association (NABA) were also determining factors. Arizona, Texas, and Utah Lead with Strong Regulatory Clarity Arizona, Texas, and Utah scored highest, reflecting a strong commitment to fostering crypto innovation and regulatory clarity. “Texas, Arizona, and Utah earned Trailblazer status for their strength in both policy and ecosystem development,” the report noted. Other states like North Carolina, California, New Hampshire, and Wyoming also showed notable progress across multiple categories. Adam Minehardt, Chainlink Labs’ head of policy, emphasized that while federal crypto regulation receives most attention, significant momentum is building at the state level. He described the report as shedding light on states’ vital roles in shaping digital asset opportunities and challenges ahead. Currently, more than half of U.S. states have robust congressional support for blockchain policy, and over a third operate dedicated pro-crypto task forces. ARIZONA SIGNS STRATEGIC BITCOIN RESERVE INTO LAW! pic.twitter.com/xQXsm2fEXQ — Dennis Porter (@Dennis_Porter_) May 8, 2025 About 22% run blockchain pilot programs, while 16% are pursuing strategic Bitcoin reserve initiatives, signaling growing institutional interest at the regional level. This surge in state-level activity coincides with the U.S. government’s “Crypto Week,” which aims to pass three crucial bills to enhance industry standards and clarify regulatory frameworks. These include the GENIUS Act for stablecoin innovation, the CLARITY Act focused on digital asset market regulation , and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act opposing a central bank digital currency. While industry insiders admit the CLARITY Act has imperfections, its potential passage could position the U.S. as a global leader in digital asset policy. Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Hit Record $91 Billion in 2025 Corporate interest in Bitcoin surged in Q2 2025, with companies adding a record 159,107 BTC valued at over $17.6 billion. This marked a 23.13% rise from the previous quarter and brought total corporate holdings to 847,000 BTC, about 4% of the capped 21 million supply, according to Bitwise Asset Management. The total value of corporate Bitcoin treasuries soared to $91 billion by the end of June, driven by Bitcoin’s price increase of nearly 61% over the quarter. Public companies holding Bitcoin also jumped sharply, with 46 new entrants raising the total number of firms to 125, a 58.23% quarter-on-quarter increase. Leading corporate holders include Michael Saylor’s Strategy with 597,325 BTC, driving strong stock performance with a 43% year-to-date gain. Bitcoin miner MARA Holdings holds nearly 50,000 BTC, while newcomers like Twenty One and Metaplanet have also made significant purchases .

2025-07-16T13:40:23,"Ripple Price Analysis: Will XRP Break All-Time High Levels in This Aggressive Rally?","XRP has finally come alive after a prolonged period of consolidation and underperformance relative to other major crypto assets. Over the past two weeks, Ripple’s token has broken out from long-standing patterns against both USD and BTC, shifting market structure and flipping critical resistances into support. The breakout is not only technical, it’s aggressive, with surging momentum and elevated RSI levels, hinting at the return of speculation and perhaps early signs of a narrative forming around XRP again. But how sustainable is this rally? Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The USDT Pair The XRPUSDT chart is showing a powerful breakout above $2.30 after months of sideways action. The price broke out of a falling wedge pattern that had been forming since late 2024. The wedge breakout was accompanied by a strong bullish candle that closed well above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, both located around the $2.30 zone. XRP is now pushing into a major resistance area at $3.00, a zone that previously acted as a supply ceiling multiple times during the past year. The rally has been sharp, and the RSI has entered extremely overbought territory at 80. Historically, such RSI spikes have led to corrections or sideways consolidation before continuation. As long as XRP holds above the 100-day and 200-day moving averages in the coming days, the path toward $3.40 and even $4.00 opens up. However, a close below the MAs could trigger profit-taking and drag the price back below $2.00. The BTC Pair The XRP/BTC pair also confirms this momentum shift. The price has broken out of a falling wedge structure and flipped the key 2,200 SAT range into support. This is significant, as XRP had been trending downward against BTC for the majority of 2025. The breakout invalidates the bearish market structure and suggests a new trend phase could be developing. Currently sitting around 2,500 SAT, XRP/BTC is testing its 200-day moving average and is trying to make higher highs and higher lows above it. Moreover, the RSI on this pair is also overbought at 83, suggesting the rally may be overextended in the short term. The next significant resistance lies around 3,100 SAT, a zone that acted as a major distribution region during XRP’s last bullish leg. If XRP/BTC can consolidate above the 2,400 SAT level, the buyers will likely aim for this zone in the next impulse.

2025-07-16T13:29:32,"Standard Chartered: Bankers Prefer Stablecoins Over Bitcoin","Experts predict that the capitalization of stablecoins could grow to $750 billion by the end of 2026 . In the U.S., key cryptocurrency regulation proposals are under consideration, while major banks are increasingly exploring stablecoin solutions under pressure from fintech rivals. Clients of the American division of Standard Chartered Bank are showing more interest in stablecoins than in Bitcoin. This was stated by Jeffrey Kendrick , Head of Digital Asset Research at the bank, according to The Block . According to the bank, around 90% of recent client discussions were focused on stablecoins. Last week, meetings were held in Washington, D.C., New York, and Boston with clients and regulators. Participants discussed the potential economic impact of stablecoins, anticipating growth in the market to $750 billion . As of now, the segment is valued at about $263 billion , according to CoinGecko . Kendrick believes the $750 billion projection could be reached by the end of 2026. At that point, stablecoins may begin to influence traditional financial markets and monetary policy. In particular, a larger issuance of U.S. Treasury bills may be required to back stablecoins, which could alter the structure of national debt and affect the global demand for the U.S. dollar, he emphasized. Regulatory Momentum Builds The discussions coincided with the U.S. government's active review of legislation to regulate the industry—most notably the GENIUS Act , focused on stablecoins. On July 15 , the U.S. House of Representatives rejected three cryptocurrency-related bills. However, following news of President Donald Trump's Oval Office meeting with House members, a new vote schedule was proposed. Consideration of the bills is now set to begin on July 16 . According to Kendrick, once legislation like the GENIUS Act is passed in developed countries, stablecoins will likely enter widespread use for payments. Corporations will benefit from faster and cheaper transactions, while banks and municipalities could begin issuing their own digital assets. He also noted that in developing countries, consumers often purchase stablecoins to save in dollars—offering protection from the devaluation of local currencies. However, Kendrick warned that a large outflow of funds via stablecoins could create challenges for some economies, making it more difficult to manage exchange rates and preserve banking system stability. Tokenization & the CLARITY Act Kendrick also discussed the CLARITY Act , which he believes could serve as a regulatory blueprint for digital assets and commodities. One of its key impacts, he said, would be on the RWA (Real World Asset) market . The legislation aims to set a framework for the tokenization of assets ranging from real estate to stocks, which would expand the use of DeFi protocols like Aave , he added. Fintech Pressure and JPMorgan's Move JPMorgan , the largest bank in the U.S., is currently exploring publicly traded, dollar-pegged stablecoins , according to CNBC . Despite previous skepticism, CEO Jamie Dimon acknowledged the shift in view: “I don’t understand why they are needed in place of normal payments. But we are obliged to investigate it.” Dimon explained that the move comes amid increased competition from fintech firms: “They are smart, they want to build bank accounts and payment systems. We can’t miss that.” JPMorgan is currently testing its JPMD stablecoin on the Base blockchain , a network supported by U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase . Designed to facilitate settlements among institutional clients, the coin may become a key piece in JPMorgan’s emerging blockchain infrastructure.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9964/standard-chartered-bankers-prefer-stablecoins-over-bitcoin,"REGULATION|BTC|FIAT|EXCHANGE|MARKET","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

In a recent X post, Hayes proclaimed that the ‘Ethereum season’ has officially commenced, a statement that immediately sent ripples across the decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) communities. Signaling his conviction, Hayes even updated his profile picture to a CryptoPunk, a classic move often associated with renewed interest in the digital collectibles space. But what exactly does this mean for the future of Ethereum and the broader crypto market? Let’s dive deep into why this announcement is stirring such excitement and what it could signify for the Ethereum price and its ecosystem. Why is the Ethereum Price Poised for a Breakthrough? Arthur Hayes’ pronouncement isn’t just a casual observation; it often reflects a deeper understanding of market cycles and underlying fundamentals. The Ethereum price has been a subject of intense speculation, and several factors suggest it could indeed be on the cusp of significant movement. Ethereum, as the backbone of much of the decentralized web, benefits from a confluence of technological advancements, growing adoption, and shifting institutional sentiment. Dencun Upgrade Impact: The recent Dencun upgrade, particularly the implementation of EIP-4844 (Proto-Danksharding), has significantly reduced transaction costs on Layer 2 networks built on Ethereum. This improvement is crucial for scaling the network, making DeFi applications and NFT transactions more affordable and accessible for a wider user base. Lower fees typically translate to higher usage, which can positively impact demand for ETH. Staking Yields and Deflationary Pressure: Post-Merge, Ethereum transitioned to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. The act of staking ETH removes it from circulation, reducing sell pressure. Furthermore, the EIP-1559 upgrade introduced a fee-burning mechanism, making ETH a deflationary asset under certain network conditions. As network activity increases, more ETH is burned, potentially increasing its scarcity and value. Institutional Interest: The success of spot Bitcoin ETFs has paved the way for similar products for Ethereum. Discussions around spot Ethereum ETFs are gaining traction, with major financial institutions exploring their launch. Approval of such products would open the floodgates for traditional finance capital to flow into ETH, providing a massive liquidity injection and legitimizing the asset further. Macroeconomic Tailwinds: A broader shift in global macroeconomic conditions, such as potential interest rate cuts and increased liquidity, could favor risk assets like cryptocurrencies. As traditional investments yield less, investors often seek higher returns in nascent markets, positioning Ethereum as a prime candidate. These combined forces create a powerful narrative for the potential appreciation of the Ethereum price , making Hayes’ call particularly timely. What Does ‘ ETH Season ‘ Truly Mean for You? The term ‘altcoin season’ or, more specifically, ‘ ETH season ‘ refers to a period where alternative cryptocurrencies, led by Ethereum, outperform Bitcoin. Historically, after Bitcoin experiences a significant rally, capital often flows into large-cap altcoins like ETH, followed by smaller-cap altcoins. Arthur Hayes’ declaration suggests we are entering, or are already in, the phase where Ethereum takes the lead. For investors, ‘ ETH season ‘ implies several key dynamics: Capital Rotation: Money that flowed into Bitcoin during its primary rally begins to rotate into Ethereum, seeking higher potential returns. Increased Network Activity: A rising Ethereum price typically coincides with heightened activity across its ecosystem – more transactions, more users engaging with DeFi protocols, and a more vibrant NFT market. Dominance Shift: Ethereum’s market dominance relative to Bitcoin often increases during this period, signaling its growing influence in the overall crypto landscape. Developer Enthusiasm: A bullish ETH market often fuels innovation, attracting more developers to build on the Ethereum blockchain, further strengthening its utility and ecosystem. Hayes’ influence stems from his deep understanding of market mechanics and his history of making prescient calls. When a figure of his stature declares ‘ ETH season ,’ it acts as a powerful signal, influencing market sentiment and potentially accelerating the very trend he predicts. It’s a psychological trigger that encourages market participants to re-evaluate their portfolios and consider increasing their exposure to Ethereum and its associated assets. Navigating the Next Wave of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Innovation At the heart of the Ethereum ecosystem lies Decentralized Finance (DeFi) , a revolutionary paradigm that aims to recreate traditional financial services using blockchain technology. If ‘ETH season’ truly unfolds, DeFi protocols are set to be major beneficiaries. Renewed interest in Ethereum often translates directly into increased Total Value Locked (TVL) and transaction volumes within DeFi. The landscape of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is constantly evolving, with new innovations emerging regularly. Here are some key areas to watch: Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) & Restaking: Protocols like Lido, Rocket Pool, and EigenLayer allow users to stake their ETH while retaining liquidity, enabling them to participate in other DeFi activities. Restaking, a newer concept, allows staked ETH to be used to secure other networks and protocols, potentially earning additional yield. Layer 2 Scaling Solutions: Optimism, Arbitrum, zkSync, and StarkNet are vital for DeFi’s scalability. With Dencun’s proto-danksharding, these Layer 2s become even more efficient, making DeFi transactions faster and cheaper, thereby attracting more users and applications. Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs): Uniswap, Curve, and Balancer remain central to DeFi, facilitating token swaps and liquidity provision. Increased trading volume during ‘ETH season’ directly benefits these platforms. Lending and Borrowing Protocols: Aave and Compound continue to be foundational. As more capital enters DeFi, the demand for lending and borrowing services will likely surge. Understanding these sectors is key to identifying potential opportunities within the broader Decentralized Finance (DeFi) space. Here’s a quick look at how different DeFi categories might perform: DeFi Category Description Potential Impact of ETH Season Liquid Staking Enables staked ETH to remain liquid (e.g., Lido’s stETH) Increased TVL as more ETH is staked; higher yields. Restaking Re-purposing staked ETH for securing other protocols Emerging sector, potentially high yields and innovation. Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) Peer-to-peer token trading (e.g., Uniswap) Higher trading volumes, increased fee generation. Lending/Borrowing Collateralized loans without intermediaries (e.g., Aave) Increased borrowing demand for leverage or liquidity. Layer 2 Solutions Scaling networks built on Ethereum (e.g., Arbitrum, Optimism) Higher user adoption due to lower fees and faster transactions. Is the NFT Market Primed for a Resurgence? Arthur Hayes’ profile picture change to a CryptoPunk wasn’t just a personal preference; it was a symbolic gesture that reverberated through the NFT market . Historically, the health of the NFT space has been closely tied to the performance of Ethereum. A rising ETH price often leads to increased liquidity and renewed interest in digital collectibles, as the underlying asset for most NFTs gains value. The NFT market experienced a boom in 2021-2022, followed by a significant cooldown. However, signs of revival have been emerging, and an ‘ETH season’ could provide the necessary catalyst for a more widespread resurgence. Key aspects to consider: Blue-Chip NFTs: Collections like CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), and Art Blocks are often the first to see renewed interest. These are considered the ‘digital art’ equivalents of traditional fine art and act as bellwethers for the broader market. Gaming & Metaverse NFTs: The intersection of NFTs with gaming (GameFi) and virtual worlds (Metaverse) continues to be a growth area. As these platforms mature and attract more users, the utility and demand for in-game NFTs and virtual land could increase. New Use Cases: Beyond profile pictures and art, NFTs are finding applications in ticketing, digital identities, intellectual property rights, and supply chain management. These real-world use cases could drive sustainable growth. Challenges remain, including market saturation and regulatory uncertainty. However, if the broader crypto market enters an ‘explosive’ bullish phase led by Ethereum, the NFT market is likely to follow suit, offering opportunities for collectors and investors alike.

The impact of Arthur Hayes crypto commentary extends beyond mere words; it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy in a market driven by sentiment. Preparing for the Next Wave: Actionable Insights If Arthur Hayes’ prediction holds true and an ‘ETH season’ is truly upon us, what can you do to navigate this potentially transformative period? Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): While influential figures provide valuable insights, always conduct your own thorough research. Understand the projects, their fundamentals, and their long-term viability. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. While Ethereum may lead, consider diversifying across different Layer 2s, promising DeFi protocols, and select NFT projects that align with your risk tolerance. Understand Gas Fees: During periods of high network activity, Ethereum gas fees can surge. Familiarize yourself with Layer 2 solutions and their lower fees to make transactions more economical. Risk Management is Key: Crypto markets are inherently volatile. Invest only what you can afford to lose. Consider setting stop-loss orders and having a clear exit strategy for taking profits. Stay Informed: Follow reliable crypto news sources, market analysts, and key opinion leaders. The market moves fast, and staying updated is crucial. This ‘Explosive’ period could offer significant opportunities, but it also comes with increased risks. Prudent decision-making and a well-thought-out strategy are essential. Conclusion: Is Ethereum Poised for an Unprecedented Run? Arthur Hayes’ declaration that ‘Ethereum season’ has begun is more than just a casual tweet; it’s a significant signal from a respected market veteran. Backed by technological advancements like the Dencun upgrade, growing institutional interest, and a robust ecosystem of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and a re-emerging NFT market, Ethereum appears to be in a strong position. While the future is never certain in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, the convergence of these factors suggests that ETH could indeed be poised for an unprecedented run.

The cryptocurrency, which had been trading near record territory, dipped to $118,593, as the global market absorbed the implications of heightened geopolitical risk in the Middle East. Bitcoin price slides on latest news in Middle East. Source: CoinMarketCap The airstrike, broadcast live on Al Jazeera , targeted the Syrian Ministry of Defense. Footage captured massive explosions near central Damascus, with reports confirming the assassination of three senior Syrian military officials. Huge explosions were seen in Damascus as Israel bombed Syria’s defence ministry during a live Al Jazeera broadcast nearby. pic.twitter.com/Fe7N6xH02I — Al Jazeera English (@AJEnglish) July 16, 2025 The move marks a major escalation in Israel’s southern campaign, deepening regional instability at a time when global markets are already on edge from ongoing tariff wars and political volatility. Bitcoin’s 24-hour trading volume stood at $78.34 billion, a significant drop of 47.41%, suggesting reduced conviction among bulls following the geopolitical shock. Despite the decline, BTC retains a market cap of $2.35 trillion and remains just below all-time highs. However, the sharp price reaction underscores Bitcoin’s evolving role not only as a store of value, but also as a risk-sensitive asset tied to global headlines. Historically, Bitcoin has been viewed as a geopolitical hedge during periods of currency debasement or financial repression. But as institutional inflows grow and broader macro linkages deepen, sudden geopolitical escalations, especially in energy-sensitive regions can lead to mixed responses. Market watchers are now closely monitoring whether this latest pullback is a temporary reaction to war-related headlines or the start of a broader consolidation phase. With Bitcoin still up more than 90% year-to-date, some degree of cooling would not be unexpected. Key technical levels to watch include support around $116,500 and deeper demand zones near $114,000, which coincide with the late June breakout range.

2025-07-16T13:12:15,"SharpLink Surpasses Ethereum Foundation in ETH Holdings","The public company SharpLink has surpassed the non-profit organization Ethereum Foundation in terms of ether reserves, with approximately 280,600 ETH compared to about 241,500 ETH (equivalent to $882 million and $759 million , respectively). ETH Reserves: Who Holds the Most? A rating of organizations by ether holdings on their balance sheets shows that PulseChain and BitMine Immersion Technologies occupy third and fourth places, with Ethereum reserves valued at $522 million and $512 million , respectively. Between July 7 and July 13 , SharpLink purchased 74,656 ETH for a total of $213 million , at an average price of $2,852 . “The current balance is approximately 280,706 ETH . Around 99.7% of these coins are staked or restaked. Since June 2, income generated from these activities has been about 415 ETH ,” company representatives stated. The total volume of Ethereum reserves held by corporations globally is estimated at 1.6 million ETH (~$5 billion) . By comparison, Ethereum-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) collectively hold 4.56 million ETH (~$14.33 billion) . Is Ethereum Back in Fashion? Over the past 24 hours, Ethereum , the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has grown by 6.3% . At the time of writing, the weighted average price of ETH is $3,161 , a level last seen in early February. By comparison, Bitcoin has risen by only 1.2% in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $58,214 . (Note: Earlier figure of $118,214 corrected for accuracy.) “After two years of underperformance, ETH is once again gaining attention,” said Greg Magadini , Director of Derivatives at Amberdata , in an interview with Decrypt . Over the past two years, Bitcoin has appreciated nearly 300% , while Ethereum has increased by a relatively modest 60% . Since the beginning of the year, ETH is down approximately 8% . Magadini noted that open interest in Ethereum futures has reached a 12-month high , comparable to levels seen when ETH was trading around $4,000 in December 2024. According to him, this signals an influx of capital and renewed activity among market participants. The Unlucky Whale According to analytics platform Lookonchain , a major investor (wallet address: 0x2258) opened a short position on Ethereum with 18x leverage on July 15 . The trader's unrealized loss currently exceeds $3.5 million . Researchers note that the position faces liquidation if ETH falls below $3,321.81 . Peter Thiel Invests in Ethereum Infrastructure Peter Thiel , co-founder of PayPal, and his investment firm Founders Fund , recently acquired a 9.1% stake in BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) , according to a 13G filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Tuesday. The document indicates that Thiel-linked entities bought 5,094,000 BMNR shares through several legal structures. Other participants in the June funding round included Pantera Capital , Galaxy Digital , and Kraken . BitMine has also appointed Tom Lee , co-founder of Fundstrat and well-known for his Bitcoin market predictions, as its Chairman of the Board . In total, more than 55 million shares were privately placed at a price of $4.50 per share , with proceeds intended to replenish Ethereum reserves . BitMine operates as a digital asset mining and management company. Since June, it has been led by Tom Lee , who also serves as Chief Investment Officer at Fundstrat . Following the launch of its Ethereum strategy, BitMine shares have experienced high volatility , with closing prices ranging from $4.26 to as high as $135 . On July 14 , BMNR shares surged to $59 , a 45% increase from the previous Friday's close of $40.62 . However, by the end of the session, prices fell to $41.02 , ending the day with a modest 1% gain . Ethereum: Complex, but Promising Bitcoin remains the dominant asset held in corporate crypto treasuries. According to Bitcoin Treasuries , public companies currently hold around 863,298 BTC , valued at over $102 billion . However, Ethereum's sophistication and utility continue to attract corporate attention. “Ethereum’s flexibility makes it more attractive—but also more complex to use,” said Ryan Chou , co-founder of BTCFi project Solv Protocol . He describes Ethereum as “digital oil”—a universal asset fueling much of on-chain finance: staking, transaction gas, collateral, and settlements. These concepts, however, are harder to explain to mainstream markets compared to Bitcoin’s simple “store of value” narrative. “Ethereum still has significant potential as a tool for both participation and savings . Forward-thinking corporate treasuries are beginning to understand this,” Chou added. In his view, Ethereum is poised to become a key component of institutional on-chain infrastructure . “As we enter a new wave of mass adoption, assets with real-world utility , not just storage value, will become far more important,” he concluded.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9962/sharp-link-surpasses-ethereum-foundation-in-eth-holdings,"ETH|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX","News|Ethereum",cryptocompare

Breakthrough Project Debuts At Ripple HQ The California Breakthrough Project brings together an influential group of innovators and executives, convened by Governor Newsom to foster a dialogue between state decision-makers and the tech community. The inaugural meeting reportedly took place on June 6 at Ripple’s headquarters in San Francisco and included leaders from diverse sectors, including AME Cloud Ventures, Anduril, Instacart, Scopely, and Snap Inc. Notable figures such as Asheesh Birla, Ron Conway, Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen, Jeff Lawson, Jen Pahlka, and Jason Wheeler also joined the group, underscoring the project’s ambitious scope. The initiative aims to address “systemic inefficiencies” in government processes by harnessing innovative ideas from the tech sector . By fostering collaboration between state leaders and industry experts, the California Breakthrough Project seeks to develop modern solutions that enhance public services. Efforts To Transform California’s Public Services The group will also focus on maintaining public transparency and ethical safeguards throughout the innovation process, ensuring that the interests of labor and civil society are considered. This project builds on Governor Newsom’s ongoing efforts to incorporate expert voices into public policy, particularly in the realm of artificial intelligence (AI). Earlier this year, he co-hosted a Generative AI summit that gathered leaders from academia, industry, and civil society to discuss the transformative potential of AI technologies for the state. As part of this broader initiative, Governor Newsom has signed an executive order mandating all state agencies to implement efficiency measures and create new initiatives aimed at engaging the entire state workforce. Newsom claimed : The Golden State continues to lead in efficiency, strategically implementing technologies and practices that make Californians’ lives better. As the birthplace of modern tech, our state is uniquely positioned to bring the best and the brightest together to advance our work. We will not shy away from progress, but embrace it for the benefit of all Californians, including our state workforce. The task force will collaborate closely with leaders and front-line employees from various state agencies to identify opportunities for streamlining and improving government operations. Despite the governor’s announcement, Ripple, Coinbase, and Moonpay have not issued any official statements clarifying their respective roles in this new project for the Golden State. As of this writing, the broader cryptocurrency market is experiencing a notable correction following the House of Representatives’ failure to pass crucial crypto legislation. Consequently, Ripple’s XRP token dropped toward the $2.90 level after briefly surpassing the $3 mark during Monday’s market rally.

2025-07-16T12:55:24,"Pi Network Wallet Moves 2.8M Tokens from OKX","The post Pi Network Wallet Moves 2.8M Tokens from OKX appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A mysterious wallet has grabbed the crypto community’s attention after on-chain data from PiScan revealed it has withdrawn millions of PI tokens from OKX. The wallet, tagged as ODM, now holds over 315 million PI, sparking speculation about a potential buyback strategy by the Pi Core Team or preparation for a major exchange listing. PiScan Data Reveals Massive PI Token Accumulation According to PiScan, the ODM wallet has received around 2.8 million PI tokens from the OKX exchange . This isn’t the first time it’s made waves—earlier, it withdrew 3.5 million PI tokens in a single move. Currently, the wallet is sitting on over 315 million PI tokens, making it one of the largest holders in the ecosystem. Who Controls the ODM Wallet? As of now, the identity behind the ODM wallet remains undisclosed. However, rumors are circulating that it might be operated by the Pi Core Team as part of an internal buyback initiative. Such strategic accumulation by a non-public wallet has drawn comparisons to early Bitcoin “Satoshi” wallet behavior, fueling speculation that Pi Network could be prepping for something big—perhaps an ecosystem upgrade, token stabilization plan, or exchange listing. Is It an Official PI Buyback Wallet? If confirmed, the ODM wallet may be part of an official buyback mechanism aimed at: Stabilizing PI’s market price, Enhancing liquidity for decentralized exchanges (DEXs), Supporting developer grants and hackathons. While the Pi Core Team has actively promoted development through hackathons, their position on price stabilization remains unclear. PI Token Price: Volatile and Under Pressure The PI token has seen a sharp decline: Down 10.9% in the last 14 days, Down 4.8% in the past week, Down 2.2% in the last 24 hours. This trend reflects growing pressure from token unlocks and circulating supply increases. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Jane Fraser Confirms Citi Stablecoin Plans As Rules Ease Under Trump , Concerns Over Token Unlocks Intensify Between July 8 and July 15, over 100 million PI tokens were unlocked—1.5% of the total supply. The largest daily unlock occurred on July 4, when 19.39 million tokens were released. Looking ahead, another 137.85 million PI tokens are scheduled to unlock by month-end, with similar figures expected in August. These unlocks are causing selling pressure, contributing to volatility in the market. Some investors fear further drops unless liquidity support mechanisms are introduced—possibly via wallets like ODM. Why This Matters: Strategic or Speculative? If ODM is indeed a Pi Core Team-controlled wallet, its activity could: Provide short-term market stability, Signal a major announcement or listing, Support ecosystem growth through controlled accumulation. However, until verified, the wallet’s role remains speculative, and the market is watching closely. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

It’s unconfirmed. However, if the ODM wallet is part of a buyback plan, it could help stabilize prices and support liquidity. Why is PI price falling despite development efforts? PI is undergoing large token unlocks, increasing the circulating supply and putting pressure on the price. Is a PI exchange listing coming soon? While nothing is confirmed, strategic token movements suggest possible preparation for a listing or ecosystem announcement. How many PI tokens will unlock this month?

2025-07-16T12:52:42,"Bitcoin Pizza Guy’s 10,000 BTC Could Buy Private Islands Today – What Else Is Possible After Bitcoin’s New ATH?","Bitcoin’s historic surge to a new all-time high of $123,091 has transformed Laszlo Hanyecz’s legendary 10,000 BTC pizza purchase into a $1.23 billion fortune, capable of purchasing Leonardo da Vinci’s “Salvator Mundi” twice over, multiple private islands, or entire luxury resort chains. The Bitcoin Pizza Guy’s May 22, 2010 , transaction, which bought two Papa John’s pizzas for approximately $41 worth of Bitcoin, now represents one of the most expensive meals in history. The same 10,000 BTC could today be used to acquire over 100 meters long superyachts, fleets of hypercars, or fund world-scale philanthropic initiatives. Source: Hindustan Times Bitcoin at $0.118M Today Bitcoin’s latest milestone liquidated $1.3 billion in short positions within 60 seconds as the cryptocurrency skipped past $120,000 and surged directly to $121,000. In fact, the Bloomberg Terminal has started displaying Bitcoin’s price in millions, showing $0.118M for $118,000 With a market capitalization of $2.39 trillion, Bitcoin has officially surpassed Amazon and ranks as the world’s fifth-largest asset by market value. Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao put the achievement in perspective, noting that after buying Bitcoin in 2014, it took three years to reach $1,000 again in January 2017. He called today’s milestone “just a fraction” of what’s to come , suggesting current excitement will seem minimal in future years. After I bought bitcoin in 2014, it took 3 years to reach an ATH of $1000 again in Jan 2017. We were excited. Now, that is just a small fraction, less than 1%. Today, you might be excited by the current ATH. In a few years, this will be just a fraction. — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) July 14, 2025 The rally has added $1.2 trillion to crypto markets since President Trump paused “reciprocal tariffs” on April 9 , with Bitcoin gaining $15,000 since the House passed Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” on July 3. Institutional capital can no longer ignore Bitcoin, with family offices, hedge funds, and conservative funds allocating approximately 1% of assets under management to BTC. From $41 to Billions: The Evolution of Pizza Money The pizza purchase was part of Bitcoin’s first real-world transaction, establishing a baseline value of $0.0041 per BTC. By November 2013, the same 10,000 BTC would have been worth $11 million, sufficient for a Hamptons mansion, fine art collection, or multiple luxury supercars. The 2017 peak of $19,700 per Bitcoin valued the pizza holdings at $197 million, which could purchase private jets like the Gulfstream G650 ($65 million), Monaco villas, custom superyachts, or small Caribbean islands. The November 2021 all-time high of $68,789 pushed the value to $687.89 million. At current prices, the 10,000 BTC could acquire Leonardo da Vinci’s “ Salvator Mundi ,” previously sold for $450 million, and still retain hundreds of millions for additional masterpieces. Source: Art Of Eric Wayne The fortune could purchase over 20 “Graff Diamonds Hallucination” watches valued at $55 million each, or nearly 50 Patek Philippe Supercomplication timepieces worth $24 million. Alternative investments include approximately 9,500 kilograms of gold bullion, valued at current prices of around $3,332 per ounce, representing over 334,000 ounces of precious metal. The holdings could also fund the purchase and development of large South Pacific or Caribbean islands with extensive infrastructure projects. At projected targets of $150,000 per Bitcoin, the pizza holdings would reach $1.5 billion, which could buy Manhattan skyscraper floors, multiple high-profile private islands, centuries-old European castles, or entire commercial aviation fleets. Historical Context Shows Room for Further Growth Bitcoin’s current rally maintains historical patterns, where multiple 30-40% corrections occur during bull markets; yet, the largest correction in this cycle has been only 23.48%. Previous major corrections include the 2017-2018 crash, which declined from $20,000 to $3,200, representing an 84% decrease. The 2021-2022 drop from $69,000 to $15,600 marked a 77% correction, while the 2013-2015 bear market saw Bitcoin fall 87% from $1,100 to $152 following the Mt. Gox collapse. Recent cycles have shown corrections becoming less severe, often staying within 20-25% ranges during bull markets. Bitcoin ETF IBIT reached a record $76 billion in assets under management in under 350 days, compared to the gold ETF GLD, which took over 15 years to achieve the same milestone. In fact, the S&P 500 in Bitcoin terms has declined 15% year-to-date and 99.98% since 2012.

The firm recently announced it has successfully raised 10 MSEK, equivalent to approximately $1.03 million, through a directed share issue. But here’s the kicker: the explicit purpose of this capital injection is to fund its BTC Purchases . This bold move by Refine Group isn’t just a ripple; it’s a clear signal in the evolving landscape of corporate finance, highlighting a burgeoning trend towards Corporate Bitcoin Adoption . What’s Driving This Swedish Bitcoin Investment? For many, the idea of a marketing company pivoting to invest its capital in a volatile asset like Bitcoin might seem unconventional. However, Refine Group’s decision is part of a larger narrative unfolding across the globe. Companies are increasingly exploring Bitcoin as a legitimate component of their treasury strategies, seeking refuge from inflationary pressures and aiming for long-term value appreciation. Refine Group’s direct share issue for Swedish Bitcoin Investment is a testament to several underlying factors: Inflation Hedge: With global economies grappling with rising inflation, traditional fiat currencies are losing purchasing power. Bitcoin, often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ is seen by many as a robust hedge against this erosion. Store of Value: Its decentralized nature and finite supply of 21 million coins make Bitcoin an attractive long-term store of value, immune to governmental interference or quantitative easing policies. Diversification: Including Bitcoin in a corporate treasury offers diversification away from traditional assets like cash, bonds, and equities, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk and enhancing returns. Forward-Thinking Strategy: Companies like Refine Group recognize the digital transformation sweeping through finance. Embracing Bitcoin positions them as innovative and adaptable, potentially attracting a new generation of investors and clients who are digitally native. The news, initially shared by NLNico (@btcNLNico) on X, quickly garnered attention, underscoring the market’s keen interest in how traditional businesses are integrating cryptocurrencies. The Accelerating Trend of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Refine Group is certainly not the first, nor will it be the last, company to embrace Bitcoin. Over the past few years, we’ve witnessed a growing list of public and private entities making significant Bitcoin allocations. This trend, often referred to as Corporate Bitcoin Adoption , began with pioneers like MicroStrategy, which has accumulated vast amounts of BTC, viewing it as their primary treasury reserve asset. Other notable names include Tesla, Square (now Block), and various smaller enterprises across different sectors. This shift signifies a maturation of the cryptocurrency market. What was once considered a niche, speculative asset is now being seriously considered by corporate boards as a viable treasury management tool. The reasons vary, but the common thread is a belief in Bitcoin’s long-term potential and its role in a future digital economy. Key Indicators of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption: Increased public company holdings of BTC. Development of new financial products and services catering to institutional crypto demand. Growing regulatory clarity (though still evolving) in various jurisdictions. More traditional financial institutions offering crypto services to their corporate clients. Strategic Advantages of a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Implementing a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy goes beyond merely buying BTC; it involves a comprehensive assessment of risk, liquidity, and long-term objectives. For Refine Group, this strategy likely aims to: Enhance Shareholder Value: By potentially increasing the value of the company’s assets, the investment could lead to higher stock prices and greater returns for shareholders. Attract New Investors: Companies with a clear crypto strategy can appeal to a new demographic of investors who are enthusiastic about the digital asset space. Future-Proofing: As the world moves towards digital economies, having exposure to decentralized digital assets like Bitcoin can provide a competitive edge and ensure relevance in the long run. Improved Balance Sheet Strength: If Bitcoin continues its upward trajectory, it can significantly bolster the company’s balance sheet, providing more financial flexibility. However, it’s crucial for any company considering such a move to conduct thorough due diligence, including understanding the tax implications, security requirements for holding digital assets, and the potential for market volatility. Navigating the Landscape of BTC Purchases: Risks and Rewards While the potential rewards of substantial BTC Purchases are alluring, it’s equally important to acknowledge the inherent risks. Bitcoin’s price volatility is well-documented; sharp price swings can impact a company’s balance sheet, at least on paper. Regulatory uncertainty also remains a factor, as governments worldwide continue to develop their frameworks for digital assets. Despite these challenges, the long-term outlook for Bitcoin remains strong for many proponents. The increasing institutional interest, coupled with its fixed supply and growing network effect, paints a compelling picture for its future value. Companies like Refine Group are betting on this long-term appreciation, viewing short-term fluctuations as part of the journey. Considerations for Companies Making BTC Purchases: Custody Solutions: Securely storing Bitcoin is paramount. Companies often use institutional-grade custodians or robust cold storage solutions. Accounting and Reporting: Accounting for Bitcoin on a balance sheet can be complex, requiring specialized knowledge and adherence to relevant standards. Market Timing: While some advocate for dollar-cost averaging, others attempt to time the market, a strategy that carries its own risks. Refine Group’s move adds another layer to the narrative of Bitcoin’s journey from an obscure digital currency to a legitimate corporate asset. It signals a growing confidence among traditional businesses in the long-term viability and potential of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Future of Corporate Finance Refine Group’s $1.03 million share issue for BTC Purchases is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a powerful statement. It highlights the evolving perspective of corporate treasuries, moving beyond traditional assets to embrace the potential of digital currencies. This Swedish Bitcoin Investment exemplifies a growing trend of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption , where companies are strategically leveraging Bitcoin as a hedge, a growth asset, and a signal of their forward-thinking approach. As more firms explore a robust Bitcoin Treasury Strategy , we can expect to see further integration of digital assets into mainstream finance, reshaping how businesses manage their capital in an increasingly digital world. The future of corporate finance is undoubtedly becoming more decentralized and digitally-driven, and Refine Group is clearly positioning itself at the forefront of this exciting transformation.

2025-07-16T12:48:02,"Eskom Grid Surges to 60.6%—Is South Africa Poised for Its Bitcoin Mining Plan?","South Africa’s state-run power utility, Eskom, has posted a notable uptick in performance, marking a milestone in a long-struggling electricity supply system. According to a June 2025 electricity update by Minerals Council South Africa (MCSA), the utility’s Energy Availability Factor (EAF) hit an average of 60.6% for the month, the first time this year that Eskom surpassed the 60% mark. More critically, it comes just as Eskom begins to explore new frontiers, among them, Bitcoin mining. Source: Eskom & Minerals Council SA Eskom Sees Stability Gains Amid Winter Demand, But Long-Term Challenges Persist Eskom has shown signs of short-term recovery after years of persistent blackouts, failing infrastructure, and rising debt. The utility managed to avoid load-shedding through most of June and into July, marking a rare period of stability for the national grid. According to André Lourens, chief economist at MCSA, the improved performance reflects a combination of reduced maintenance, better plant output, and strategic use of emergency reserves. “Emergency reserves were sufficient and used strategically to balance the grid, even as the system came under pressure,” he said. Eskom’s Energy Availability Factor (EAF), a measure of plant readiness, typically improves in winter as maintenance is scaled back. In early June, the utility brought 2,500 MW of generation capacity back online ahead of a cold front, helping keep unplanned outages below the 15,000 MW threshold that often triggers Stage 2 load-shedding. Eskom’s Winter Outlook projects that if unplanned outages remain below 13,000 MW, the country can avoid blackouts altogether. Even in a less favorable scenario with 15,000 MW in outages , blackouts would be limited to 21 days over the 153-day winter season. The National Transmission Company South Africa (NTCSA) also released a 52-week forecast, indicating Eskom has adequate capacity to meet demand and reserve requirements through July 2026, even factoring in up to 17,200 MW in unplanned outages. Still, electricity production remains below pre-pandemic levels. Eskom is currently producing around 16,800 GWh per month, up from earlier in the year but still short of the 17,100 GWh monthly average in 2024 and far below the 19,000 GWh peak in 2019. Eskom 52-week outlook Source: Eskom & Minerals Council SA Lourens said output could edge slightly higher in July and August as winter demand peaks. Financially, the utility remains under pressure. Electricity sales have fallen 16% over the past decade, from 217.9 TWh in 2014 to 183.3 TWh in 2024. Revenue, however, has risen 115% over the same period, largely due to steep tariff increases. The average electricity price rose from R0.71 per kWh in 2014 to R2.12 in 2025. Despite falling demand and rising costs, Eskom’s workforce remains bloated. While employee numbers have dropped from 50,000 to 40,000 over the past decade, the World Bank estimates only 14,200 are needed. Labor costs have soared, increasing nearly tenfold since the 1990s. With R403 billion ($22.7 billion) in debt, Eskom is now exploring new revenue opportunities. CEO Dan Marokane recently suggested repurposing excess electricity to support energy-intensive sectors such as AI, data centers, and Bitcoin mining . Eskom Eyes Bitcoin Mining, AI as Part of Future Energy Strategy Amid Operational Setbacks Eskom is exploring Bitcoin mining and AI-driven data centers as potential solutions to utilize surplus generation capacity and stabilize its finances, according to CEO Dan Marokane. Speaking at the BizNews Conference earlier this month, Marokane said the utility is drawing lessons from the United States, where Bitcoin mining operations have contributed to grid flexibility by reducing power use during high-demand periods. Eskom explores supporting Bitcoin mining, AI, and data centers as South Africa’s utility confronts falling electricity sales, debt, and renewable competition. #Eskom #BitcoinMining https://t.co/1iB479D9fg — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 1, 2025 Eskom is studying similar demand-response models, such as Texas-based Riot Platforms, which earned $32 million in 2023 by cutting power consumption during a heatwave. “There are exciting opportunities around AI and data centers, but also within the space of Bitcoin,” said Marokane. However, environmental concerns persist. A 2024 study in Nature Communications linked major U.S. mining facilities to air pollution across state lines, while their energy use surpassed that of Los Angeles. Although global Bitcoin mining is gradually shifting toward renewables, 52.4% as of the latest Cambridge report , natural gas remains the primary energy source, replacing coal. Eskom’s shift in strategy comes as it continues to struggle with unplanned outages and rising operating costs. From June 13 to 19, outages briefly surged to over 15,000 MW, forcing the utility to increase its use of expensive open-cycle gas turbines. Diesel spending has reached R4.51 billion so far this year—more than double the same period in 2024. The utility is also dealing with delays at the Koeberg Nuclear Power Station. The return of Unit 1 has been pushed back by at least a month after inspections revealed defects in four steam generator tubes. Eskom confirmed that the defects have been addressed in line with safety standards, following assistance from international specialists. Despite the setbacks, Marokane said Eskom must evolve. “The business has to reinvent itself and use part of this baseload in a way that can help it manage the remainder of its debt pile,” he said.

2025-07-16T12:45:29,"Singapore court approves WazirX request to revote on creditor scheme","The Singapore High Court just gave the green light for a revote on the hacked WazirX crypto exchange restructuring plan. The court reversed its June 4 ruling rejecting WazirX’s restructuring proposal. This would allow the Indian crypto exchange to reopen and begin reimbursing users within weeks. The revised plan, submitted by WazirX’s parent firm Zettai, aims to resolve earlier regulatory objections. It is particularly concerned about Panama-based Zensui and its compliance under Singapore’s Financial Services and Markets Act (FSMA). Earlier, the US, Japan, and South Korea had issued a joint statement, confirming that North Korea’s Lazarus Group was behind the attack. WazirX eyes reopening As per the amended scheme, Indian-registered Zanmai Labs will now oversee all distributions to creditors and users. Zettai and Zensui will no longer handle fund disbursement or core operations. The structural shift toward a locally regulated operator seems like a key in swaying the court. The moratorium on Zettai has also been extended. It grants the company temporary relief from legal actions as it prepares for a creditor vote in the coming weeks. The Singaporean Court confirmed that all previous concerns raised during the June proceedings have been addressed in the updated filing. “Zettai is committed to completing the revote process as soon as possible,” the company stated. If approved by the requisite creditor majority and sanctioned by the court, the WazirX platform will reopen, and distributions will begin under the proposed scheme promptly. 📢 Update on Court Hearing The Singapore High Court has set aside its 4th June 2025 order in SUM 940, and has allowed a revote to be conducted based on an amended scheme. Zettai’s moratorium has also been extended. This decision follows further arguments presented by Zettai.… pic.twitter.com/j0pfywAufo — WazirX: India Ka Bitcoin Exchange (@WazirXIndia) July 16, 2025 It added that the creditors’ vote will be instrumental in securing the approval of the scheme and moving forward with the First Distribution. As of now, the WazirX creditor revote is expected to take place in the coming weeks. The crypto industry has moved ahead a lot since the Indian crypto exchange got hacked. At the time of the hack, 18 July 2024, Bitcoin was trading around $60,000-$70,000. As of now, BTC price has reached an all-time high (ATH) above $123,000. Bitcoin is trading at an average price of $118,862 at press time. CoinDCX defends fund handling Separately, another Indian crypto exchange, CoinDCX, denied allegations it moved user funds to unregistered entities in Lithuania. Reports suggest that CoinDCX CEO Sumit Gupta called the claims “misinformation.” It was followed by reports of WazirX raising the issue in an affidavit filed with the Singapore High Court. Gupta has mentioned that all INR and crypto assets from Indian users have always been held by Neblio Technologies, a registered FIU-IND entity. He added that CoinDCX had no Lithuania-based entity until February 2025, and any interactions were strictly exploratory. Source: Sumit Gupta’s X He added that on February 7, 2025, the exchange updated its terms of use to make Neblio Technologies the formal contracting party. This change was made to further strengthen transparency and user trust.

2025-07-16T12:40:20,"Revolutionary Institutional Adoption: Binance CEO Predicts a Bright Future for the Crypto Market","BitcoinWorld Revolutionary Institutional Adoption: Binance CEO Predicts a Bright Future for the Crypto Market The world of cryptocurrency has always been dynamic, often characterized by rapid shifts and passionate retail participation. However, a significant transformation is underway, signaling a profound shift in its very foundation. According to Binance CEO Richard Teng, the crypto market is not just evolving; it’s entering an exciting new phase, largely driven by a powerful force: institutional adoption . This isn’t just a ripple; it’s a tidal wave reshaping the entire landscape. Understanding the Surge in Institutional Adoption : Why Now? For years, the cryptocurrency space was predominantly a playground for individual investors, often leading to dramatic price swings and a perception of high risk. While that energy was vital for early growth, the current narrative is shifting dramatically. Richard Teng’s insights, shared on Mastercard’s official website, underscore a critical pivot: the increasing involvement of major financial institutions. But why is this happening now, and what does it truly signify? The answer lies in a confluence of factors, primarily centered around regulatory clarity and the maturation of market infrastructure. Institutions, by their nature, require robust regulatory frameworks and secure, compliant pathways to engage with new asset classes. The recent developments, particularly in the U.S., have begun to provide just that, paving the way for a more stable and predictable environment. Regulatory Clarity: Governments and financial bodies are increasingly defining how cryptocurrencies fit into existing legal and financial structures. This reduces uncertainty, a major barrier for institutional entry. Improved Infrastructure: The development of secure custody solutions, regulated exchanges, and advanced trading platforms makes it safer and more efficient for large players to participate. Growing Demand: Clients of traditional financial institutions are showing increasing interest in crypto, prompting these firms to offer digital asset products. The Catalyst: How Bitcoin ETFs Reshaped the Landscape If institutional adoption is the rising tide, then the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has been the moon pulling it. This landmark event in early 2024 was a game-changer, opening the floodgates for a new class of investors who previously couldn’t, or wouldn’t, directly hold Bitcoin. Before ETFs, investing in Bitcoin often meant navigating complex exchanges, managing private keys, and dealing with security concerns – hurdles that are simply too high for many institutional investors and their clients. Spot Bitcoin ETFs changed this by offering a familiar, regulated investment vehicle. Now, large asset managers, pension funds, and wealth advisors can gain exposure to Bitcoin through traditional brokerage accounts, just like they would with stocks or bonds. This significantly lowers the barrier to entry for substantial capital. The immediate impact was clear: billions of dollars flowed into these new funds, demonstrating the pent-up demand from the institutional world. This influx of capital not only boosted Bitcoin’s price but also lent unprecedented legitimacy to the asset class, signaling to other institutions that crypto is here to stay and is a viable part of a diversified portfolio. Navigating the Evolving Crypto Market : From Volatility to Stability? The very nature of the crypto market is undergoing a profound transformation. What was once characterized by extreme volatility, often driven by speculative retail trading and market sentiment, is now showing signs of increasing maturity. Richard Teng aptly points out this shift, noting that the market has matured significantly with institutional involvement. While volatility will always be a part of nascent markets, institutional participation tends to bring a more measured, long-term investment approach. This can lead to: Reduced Price Swings: Larger, more consistent capital flows from institutions can help stabilize prices, making extreme pump-and-dump scenarios less frequent. Deeper Liquidity: Increased trading volumes from institutional players enhance market liquidity, making it easier to execute large trades without significant price impact. Enhanced Credibility: The involvement of reputable financial institutions lends credibility to the entire crypto ecosystem, attracting even more mainstream investors and businesses. This isn’t to say the market will become entirely devoid of volatility overnight, but the underlying structure is becoming more robust, resembling traditional financial markets in its operational integrity and participant diversity. Insights from the Top: What the Binance CEO Foresees As the head of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Richard Teng’s perspective carries significant weight. His observations are not merely speculative but are informed by real-time market data and direct engagement with global financial trends. His statement that the industry’s outlook remains highly optimistic, especially with crypto still in the early stages of institutional adoption, is a powerful endorsement. Teng’s optimism stems from several key observations: Untapped Potential: Despite the recent surge, the percentage of institutional capital allocated to crypto is still relatively small compared to traditional asset classes. This indicates vast room for growth. Product Innovation: The demand from institutions is driving the creation of more sophisticated financial products built on blockchain technology, extending beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. Global Expansion: While the U.S. has led the charge with ETFs, other regions are also making strides in regulatory clarity and crypto integration, suggesting a global wave of adoption. The vision is clear: as more institutions enter, the crypto market will become more integrated into the global financial system, potentially unlocking unprecedented levels of capital and innovation. Beyond the Hype: The Path to Market Maturity and Future Growth The journey towards full market maturity is a continuous one, and while significant strides have been made, the path ahead holds both immense opportunities and some challenges. The increasing presence of institutions doesn’t just mean more money; it signifies a shift in perception and functionality. Benefits of this Maturation: Increased Stability: As discussed, larger capital flows can smooth out price volatility. Enhanced Trust: The involvement of regulated entities can build greater public and governmental trust in the asset class. Broader Utility: Institutions are exploring blockchain beyond just trading, looking into its applications for supply chain, tokenization of real-world assets, and more efficient financial services. Innovation Acceleration: Demand from sophisticated clients pushes for better technology, security, and financial products within the crypto space. Potential Challenges to Navigate: Regulatory Nuances: While progress is being made, global regulatory frameworks are still evolving and can vary significantly by jurisdiction. Technological Scalability: As more users and transactions come onto blockchain networks, scalability solutions must keep pace. Security Risks: The digital nature of crypto means constant vigilance against hacks and exploits is necessary. For individual investors, this maturation means a potentially less volatile, more accessible, and more legitimate market. It encourages a long-term investment perspective rather than purely speculative trading. Conclusion: A New Dawn for Digital Assets Richard Teng’s optimistic outlook is more than just a CEO’s hopeful prediction; it’s a reflection of tangible shifts occurring across the global financial landscape. The confluence of regulatory advancements, the success of spot Bitcoin ETFs, and the undeniable interest from traditional finance has ushered in an era where institutional capital is no longer on the sidelines but is actively shaping the future of digital assets. We are witnessing the transformation of a once niche, volatile market into a more robust, integrated, and credible component of the global financial system. While the journey to full maturity is ongoing, the foundation being laid by institutional adoption promises a future for cryptocurrency that is not just bright, but truly revolutionary. This marks a new dawn for digital assets, promising greater stability, wider acceptance, and unprecedented innovation for years to come.

2025-07-16T12:15:00,"Crypto Rally Is Back On, and These Are the Altcoins to Watch","Ethereum forms a strong bull flag pattern, hinting at a possible $4,000 breakout. Surge in Ethereum’s daily transactions shows rising demand and investor confidence. Altcoins like SOL, XRP, and DOGE gain traction despite recent pullbacks and volatility. The price chart for Ethereum is now forming a massive “bull flag,” a classic technical pattern that often signals a major price surge is on the way. Analysts are watching this setup closely, suggesting a breakout could push the price toward the key $4,000 psychological level. With Ethereum currently trading at $3,163.61 , a 5.87% increase, market participants are bracing for a possible run toward the $4,000 mark a key psychological and technical level that many believe could trigger explosive gains. Ethereum Eyes Critical Breakout Level According to market analyst Cas Abbé, Ethereum is showcasing one of the clearest bull flag patterns seen in recent cycles. Historically, a breakout from such a setup has triggered aggressive price surges. Abbé draws a parallel to Bitcoin’s surge from $16,000, which led to a 300% rally. The importance of reclaiming $4,000 for Ethereum cannot be overstated.

2025-07-16T12:14:45,"Cardano Price Prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030: Will ADA Price Hit $2?","The post Cardano Price Prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030: Will ADA Price Hit $2? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Story Highlights The live price of the Cardano token is $ 0.74739182 . Price prediction suggests potential to reach $2.05 by year-end 2025. Long-term forecasts indicate ADA could hit $10.25 by 2030. The Plomin Hard Fork, which activated in Q1 2025, has significantly enhanced Cardano’s appeal to investors by establishing full decentralized governance. This is seen as a key milestone that aligns with the blockchain’s long-term vision of community-driven decision-making. Despite these advancements, bullish attraction post-Plomin Hard Fork was tempered by market dynamics and challenges, on its price chart. However, in Q2 2025, things seem to have changed , as a variety of optimistic factors surround the altcoin sector, which is benefiting the ADA price. As a result, Cardano price prediction is heating up again in the community. With bullish technical signals, major upgrades, and ETF hopes rising , many are intrigued to know, “Is ADA Price ready for a massive breakout?” Here’s a detailed ADA price prediction for 2025 and beyond, including expert targets up to 2050. Coinpedia’s Cardano Price Prediction 2025 Assuming that Cardano continues to focus on the network’s upcoming updates, we can expect a wider adoption rate. Even the ETF odds has higher approval rate that could bring large crowd wil multi-billion dollars into the asset, once approved. Therefore, we expect the ADA price to reach $2.05 in 2025. Table of Contents Coinpedia’s Cardano Price Prediction 2025 Cardano Price Today Cardano Price Prediction for July 2025 ADA Price Prediction 2025 Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Cardano Price Prediction 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Market Analysis FAQs Cardano Price Today Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $ 0.74739182 1.58% Market Cap $ 26,454,196,399.6041 Trading Volume $ 1,249,590,998.1703 Circulating Supply 35,395,351,625.8849 All-time High $3.10 on 02nd Sept 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on 02nd Oct 2017 Cardano Price Prediction for July 2025 The Cardano price is trapped in a long bleeding range in the entire H1 2025, but showed signs of recovery in late June, triggered by the ceasefire in the Iran-Israel-US short-term war. Over the last 22 days, it has recovered nearly 47% from the $0.55 support level. With the recent bullish momentum in the crypto sector, by mid-July, the ADA price has broken out from the upper border of the declining wedge. With the growing hopes of an ADA ETF, rising institutional interest, and global sentiment rising as BTC jumped to a new ATH of $123,231. ADA has now pierced the 200-day EMA band and turned it into support. The current rally shows a sustained bullish momentum that could lead to higher levels. The key level to watch next is $0.83. If ADA holds and reclaims this level, a breakout above that range may lead to a rally toward $1.10, and if this resistance is cleared, ADA could aim for $1.32 by July end. Moreover, in the past 15-day span, Spot volume has peaked, active addresses (7d) have increased to 158.65K, and whale transactions are also pacing up. This is showing sustainable bullish momentum. However, failure to stay above $0.70 could send ADA back to $0.65, and $0.55 Price Prediction Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) July 2025 $0.40 $0.74 $1.10 ADA Price Prediction 2025 Source: coincarp Cardano has always prioritized decentralization, and the recent Plomin hard fork has taken it a step further. Unlike many other blockchains, Cardano gives more control to its users than to any central organization. This is reflected in CoinCarp’s rich list, where the top 100 addresses hold just 22% of the mainnet’s circulating supply, significantly lower than most other altcoins. Technically, if ADA price intends for a long-term rally, then a break above the $1.10–$1.20 range, strong retail participation will be key. A major catalyst could be the approval of an ADA ETF, expected by year-end, which could attract billions in inflows. Another would be a global attraction in the sector with BTC continuing northward moves. Therefore, if ADA holds above its Q1 2025 high, it has a strong chance of retesting the $2.05 mark before the year ends. Scenario Potential Low Average Price Potential High Without ETF Approval $0.85 $1.10 $1.25 With ETF Approval + Retail Surge $1.20 $1.65 $2.05 Bullish Breakout (with ETF & macro support) $1.50 $2.05 $2.80 Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Price Prediction Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) 2026 2.75 3.00 3.25 2027 4.50 4.75 5.00 2028 5.25 5.50 5.75 2029 6.75 7.25 7.75 2030 9.00 9.75 10.25 This table, based on historical movements, shows ADA prices to reach $10.25 by 2030 based on compounding market cap each year.
