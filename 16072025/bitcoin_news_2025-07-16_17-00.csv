2025-07-16T14:56:57,"Swedish Refine Group Launches $1M Bitcoin Treasury Strategy","Swedish digital commerce company Refine Group AB has launched a Bitcoin treasury strategy backed by $1 million in fresh capital. The Stockholm-based company raised 10 million Swedish krona through a directed share issue to fund its initial Bitcoin purchases, establishing a new Digital Assets business area alongside its existing Products and Digital Services divisions. Refine’s board of directors resolved to issue 54.37 million shares at 0.1839 krona per share, representing a 20% discount to the seven-day volume-weighted average price of 0.2299 krona, according to the company’s official press release . The company joins other publicly-traded firms that have adopted Bitcoin treasury strategies, including MicroStrategy and Japan’s Metaplanet . Source: Refine Group Strategic Positioning and Capital Structure Refine Group’s treasury strategy centers on accumulating Bitcoin as a core reserve asset while maintaining focus on its traditional digital commerce operations. The company introduced a new performance metric, “Bitcoin per Share,” to track its ability to create long-term shareholder value through strategic Bitcoin accumulation. Chief Executive Officer David Wallinder emphasized the strategic rationale behind the decision, stating that “Bitcoin’s scarcity and global liquidity make it a powerful complement to traditional cash management, and we look forward to continuing expanding this business area.” The directed share issue attracted significant interest from both new strategic investors and existing shareholders, with all shares in the offering fully subscribed. Caldas Capital, led by entrepreneur João Caldas, emerged as the largest participant in the funding round and is set to become Refine’s largest shareholder following the transaction. Caldas brings substantial experience in both traditional business and cryptocurrency markets, having previously founded and sold cosmetics manufacturer Fancy Stage to Humble Group for approximately 550 million krona. His involvement includes both strategic capital and financial expertise, with existing shareholders representing 20% of the company already expressing intentions to propose his appointment to the board of directors. The share issuance will increase Refine’s outstanding shares from 67.5 million to 121.9 million, resulting in approximately 45% dilution for existing shareholders. The company’s share capital will rise from 6.75 million krona to 12.19 million krona following completion of the transaction. Growing European Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Refine Group’s Bitcoin adoption is part of a broader institutional acceptance of cryptocurrency treasury strategies across Europe, particularly in Nordic markets where regulatory frameworks have shown relative clarity. The company joins H100 Group , which became Sweden’s first publicly listed Bitcoin treasury firm in May 2025 after acquiring 4.39 BTC, worth approximately $475,000. This corporate adoption trend coincides with political developments in Sweden, where lawmakers have urged the government to explore establishing a national Bitcoin reserve . Swedish MP Rickard Nordin has introduced a motion to add Bitcoin Reserve to Sweden’s national holdings, citing economic uncertainty and the need for fiscal diversification. #CryptoRegulation #BitcoinReserve https://t.co/anQdwjNVrO — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 11, 2025 Members of Parliament Dennis Dioukarev and Rickard Nordin submitted letters to Finance Minister Elisabeth Svantesson in April, proposing that Sweden begin accumulating Bitcoin through direct policy or budget-neutral methods such as retaining seized cryptocurrency assets. The Nordic momentum extends beyond Sweden, with nine UK-listed companies announcing Bitcoin treasury plans in recent weeks alone. These developments suggest growing corporate confidence in Bitcoin’s role as a digital store of value, even as traditional financial institutions remain cautious about their exposure to cryptocurrency. The trend extends beyond Europe, with companies like France’s Blockchain Group raising $7.7 million for Bitcoin treasury expansion and targeting 260,000 BTC by 2033. Meanwhile, Asian companies, such as Japan’s Metaplanet, and global technology firms are increasingly viewing Bitcoin as a hedge against currency devaluation and inflation. Countries, governments, and institutions are increasingly adopting Bitcoin as a treasury, and the corporate adoption of Bitcoin treasury strategies will likely accelerate further, especially during the current rally.

2025-07-16T14:55:10,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Rebounds After Tuesday Decline, Reclaims $118,000","Bitcoin (BTC) has recovered after a substantial decline on Tuesday, when it plunged to a low of $115,701 before settling at $117,682. The flagship cryptocurrency is up almost 1% during the current session, trading around $118,447. Despite Tuesday’s decline, analysts believe it is unlikely for BTC to see a prolonged correction in the near term. Cantor Fitzgerald Closes In On Deal With Early Bitcoin Supporter Brandon Lutnick, Chair of Cantor Fitzgerald and son of US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, is closing in on a $4 billion deal with an early Bitcoin supporter to buy billions worth of BTC using a blank cheque vehicle backed by Cantor Fitzgerald. Cantor Equity Partners 1, a black cheque vehicle that raised over $200 million in an initial public offering, is in late-stage talks with Adam Beck, founder of Blockstream Capital, to buy $3 billion in Bitcoin. The deal mirrors a deal Brandon struck with SoftBank and Tether in April, advancing Cantor Fitzgerald’s strategy of using publicly-listed shell companies to buy Bitcoin. The deal could see Beck contribute 30,000 BTC to Cantor Equity Partners 1, worth over $3 billion, part of a broader deal with the blank cheque company to raise as much as $800 million in outside capital to fund future Bitcoin purchases. Beck and Blockstream would contribute their holdings in exchange for shares in the Cantor vehicle. According to sources, a deal could be concluded as early as this week. The deal will make Cantor one of the world’s largest and most active Bitcoin buyers, using blank cheque vehicles led by Brandon, who was named chair after his father, Howard Lutnick, joined the Trump administration. Crypto Spot Trading Down Despite Bitcoin Rally Crypto spot trading fell 22% in Q2 2025, extending its decline despite ongoing bullish sentiment. Crypto spot trading fell from $5.3 trillion in Q4 2024 to $4.6 trillion in Q1 2025. Spot crypto trading volumes on major centralized exchanges fell even further, dropping to $3.6 trillion in Q2, according to data from crypto analytics platform TokenInsight. The downturn in spot market trading comes amid a decline in altcoin trading activity and liquidity in Q2, contrasting with the resilience in the derivatives market. “Traders maintained their Q1 preference for high-frequency derivatives trading amid market uncertainty, aiming to hedge risks and leverage volatility.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) ended the weekend on a bullish note, registering an increase of nearly 2% and settling at $118,624. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as the price surged to an intraday high of $123,091 before declining and settling at $119,714. Selling pressure returned on Tuesday as traders locked in their profits after the flagship cryptocurrency surged to record levels. As a result, BTC fell to an intraday low of $115,701 before settling at $117,682. Despite Monday’s substantial drop, analysts don’t believe Bitcoin will enter a downtrend anytime soon. According to analysts from 21Shares, robust fundamentals are supporting the cryptocurrency’s current trajectory. “The structural imbalance between surging demand and a rapidly vanishing supply base makes a prolonged correction increasingly unlikely. There are far more positives than negatives right now.” According to Matt Mena, the current rally is being driven by spot Bitcoin ETFs and Bitcoin treasury companies, with retail demand almost absent. “US-listed Bitcoin ETFs have already absorbed several multiples of the BTC that will be mined this year. That doesn’t even include corporate treasury buyers, who continue to add quietly in the background.” While Mena believes BTC’s bullish trajectory will continue, he cautioned that a reversal cannot be ruled out due to macroeconomic factors. “It is certainly possible that Bitcoin consolidates, or even sees a pullback. If Trump’s proposed tariffs end up being more severe than markets currently anticipate, or if Powell signals that rate cuts are further off than expected, we could see risk assets broadly reprice lower, including Bitcoin.” BTC crossed $110,000 on Thursday (July 3) but lost momentum after reaching this level and fell 1.41% to $108,097 on Friday. The price recovered over the weekend, rising 0.19% on Saturday and nearly 1% on Sunday to settle at $109,231. Despite the positive weekend, BTC was back in the red on Monday, dropping almost 1% to 108,273. It recovered on Tuesday, rising 0.62% and settling at $108,942. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as the price rose over 2% to cross $111,000 and settle at $111,255. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC registered a 3.51% increase and moved to $115,159. Source: TradingView BTC continued pushing higher on Friday, rising 1.50% to cross $116,000 and settle at $116,885. Despite the positive sentiment, the price registered a marginal decline on Saturday. However, it recovered on Sunday, rising nearly 2% to cross $118,000 and settle at $118,624. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as BTC surged past $120,000 to set a new all-time high of $123,091 before declining and settling at $119,814, ultimately registering an increase of 0.92%. Selling pressure returned on Tuesday as BTC plunged to a low of $115,701 before settling at $117,682. The current session sees BTC up nearly 1%, trading around $118,417.

2025-07-16T14:54:09,"Large cap altcoins challenge BTC's dominance","The BTC dominance metric peaked at 63% during the latest rally to new price records. However, the dominance metric slid in the past week, as ETH and top altcoins strengthened. The dominance of BTC peaked above 63%, later declining rapidly as liquidity shifted to ETH. While a full altcoin season is still far from the current price levels, there are signs that selected coins, tokens, and projects are starting to outperform. BTC dominance returned to 61.6% based on Coingecko data, while the altcoin season index is at 36 points, up from 25 points in June. Currently, the index has moved out of the range of a full Bitcoin season, driven by ETH, SOL, and XRP. However, even smaller assets and the meme market are enjoying increased hype. The altcoin season index bounced from a full-on BTC season, as top assets outperformed on a 30-day and 90-day basis. | Source: Coinmarketcap The recent altcoin performance is seen as a potential turning point. In 2025, altcoins did not see a full season where all assets rallied. However, some of the top coins and tokens had periods of decisively outperforming BTC. Large cap altcoins challenge BTC’s dominance One of the main concerns for an altcoin market is that assets from older cycles will never see liquidity allocations again. ETH proved the exception, recently recovering from its lows and showing its key role for DeFi, stablecoin activity, and decentralized trading. For the past month, 42 out of 56 large-cap altcoins outperformed BTC, signaling a potential return to a modified altcoin market. 📈 Crypto Metric of the Day: Altcoin Season Index. Altcoin Season Index just tagged 75 percent – 42 of 56 large‑cap alts beat Bitcoin over the last 30 days. Classic rule says alt season is on when at least 75 percent of the baskets outperform $BTC . 🔍 What it means ⤵️… pic.twitter.com/iS4Spm46Be — IT Tech (@IT_Tech_PL) July 16, 2025 Over the last 90 days, multiple types of assets outperformed BTC. Some of the best performers included meme tokens, especially Pudgy Penguins (PENGU). Several memes also bounced from their lows with robust gains, including SPX, WIF, BONK, and MOG. The other class of outperforming tokens belonged to DeFi and DEX, including HYPE, AAVE, MORPHO, and others. Unlike previous altcoin seasons, this time investors are following several clear trends. Blue chip tokens like ETH, SOL, and XRP, along with several other assets, are closely watched for signs of ETF launches. Even coins from older bull seasons can hope for a recovery in the case of an ETF approval. Assets from older cycles like IOTA and XMR also outperformed BTC on a quarterly basis. Appetite for risk is increasing, showing altcoins are never really abandoned. Altcoin seasons are still short-lived Even with enthusiasm for altcoins, a full season may be short-lived. The expectation for peak valuations and rallies has ranged from 4 to 8 weeks historically. The last full altcoin season happened in 2023, with smaller rallies in between. Altcoins and tokens are also reassessing their strength. As of July 16, most crypto assets remain neutral based on their relative strength index. Few tokens are overbought or oversold. Some, like SUI, SOL, XRP, ARB, and JUP, are showing strength, based on their usage and utility. This time, the altcoin season may take into account real-world applications and usage. Apps and platforms producing significant fees remain preferable, as their tokens are supported by real economic activity. Fewer VC-backed tokens are launching on the market, removing some of the burden of value extraction.

2025-07-16T14:41:09,"Investment Firm Ark Invest Makes Significant Sell-Offs in Both Coinbase Shares and Its Own Spot Bitcoin ETF, ARKB! Details Here","Cathie Wood-led investment firm Ark Invest has seen significant sell-offs in both Coinbase (COIN) shares and its own spot Bitcoin ETF, ARKB. Ark Invest Sells $1 Million in Coinbase Stock and Its Own Bitcoin ETF The company raised approximately $13.3 million by selling 34,207 Coinbase shares and $8.7 million by selling 225,742 ARKB shares. The sales came just after both Bitcoin and Coinbase reached all-time highs. Ark Invest maintains a strategy of not exceeding 10% of any asset weight in its funds. This policy aims to maintain portfolio diversity and involves regular rebalancing in the event of significant increases or decreases in asset value. According to the company's latest data, Coinbase stock makes up 7.9% of the ARKW fund, worth approximately $172.8 million. Robinhood, the fund's largest holding, is 8%, worth $175.5 million. Coinbase shares rose 1.8% to a record $394.01 on Monday, pushing the company's market capitalization past $100 billion for the first time. However, on Tuesday, the shares fell 1.5% to $388.02. In the past month, the shares have gained more than 50%, fueled by Bitcoin's record-breaking rally and the notable IPO of its stablecoin partner, Circle. Ark Also Sells Out of Its Bitcoin ETF Ark Invest also sold $8.7 million of its own spot Bitcoin ETF, ARKB, from the same fund on Tuesday. The sale coincided with Bitcoin's recent breakout above $123,000 on Monday, followed by a drop below $116,000 on Tuesday. ARKB is the fourth largest position, accounting for 7.2% of the ARKW fund and worth approximately $157.2 million. Strong Inflows Continue into Bitcoin ETFs On Tuesday, ARKB saw net outflows of $6.2 million, while spot Bitcoin ETFs saw net inflows of $403.1 million. BlackRock's IBIT ETF led the inflows, contributing $416.3 million. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen inflows for the past nine days, raising a total of $4.4 billion. Since their launch in January 2024, the ETFs have seen total net inflows exceeding $53.3 billion. ARKB accounts for $2.9 billion of this figure and currently manages $5 billion in assets. BRN chief analyst Valentin Fournier made the following statement in his assessment: “ETF inflows are strong, altcoins are gaining momentum, and sentiment is high on macro optimism. Bitcoin has more room to top, but in the short term, we're leaving the stage to altcoins.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-16T14:37:15,"Hackers Exploit BigONE’s Systems, Steal Millions in Bitcoin and Ethereum","Crypto exchange BigONE has reported a security breach involving its hot wallet infrastructure, which resulted in an estimated $27 million loss. The incident was detected by blockchain security platform SlowMist on July 16. Hot Wallet Nightmare SlowMist said that the production network was compromised, and the operating logic of account and risk control-related servers was modified, which allowed the attacker withdraw funds. BigONE confirmed the breach after the exchange’s real-time monitoring system flagged abnormal asset movements and said it was caused by a third-party attack. The exchange, however, stated that all private keys remain secure and the attack path has been identified and contained to prevent further losses. The exchange said that it is working with SlowMist to trace the attacker’s wallet addresses and monitor the movement of the stolen funds, which include 120 BTC, 350 ETH, and over 8 million USDT across four networks. In a statement, BigONE has vowed to cover all user losses using its internal security reserves. The exchange said it aims to ensure that user assets remain intact while it continues investigations. After a temporary suspension, the platform restored its services. BigONE exec Alex Ash stated , “The system upgrade has been successfully completed. Deposit and trading services have now been fully restored, and you may log in via Web or App to resume your transactions. Thank you for your patience and continued support.” On-chain sleuth ZachXBT remarked that he does not sympathize with the exchange, and alleged that it processed significant volumes tied to pig butchering, romance, and investment scams. He added that if more “questionable” offshore exchanges like MEXC or KuCoin were hacked for large sums, it could benefit the crypto industry by acting as a “natural cleanse” without requiring government intervention. GMX Hack The incident comes days after decentralized trading platform GMX was exploited for $42 million. The hacker, however, returned $40.5 million less than 48 hours after the exploit. The penetration vector included a re-entrancy vulnerability in GMX’s V1 smart contracts on July , allowing the perpetrator to manipulate GLP token prices to drain funds. They later bridged them from Arbitrum to Ethereum. GMX offered a 10% white hat bounty in exchange for the stolen assets, which the hacker accepted, keeping a profit of about $4.5 million. GMX confirmed its V2 protocol was not affected by the incident.

2025-07-16T14:30:58,"Analyst Predicts More Rallies for Two of the ‘Strongest’ Memecoins, Hints at More Altcoin Explosions","An analyst who has earned the “Master Trader” rank on the crypto exchange Bybit believes more rallies are in store for two meme assets. Pseudonymous trader Bluntz tells his 324,600 followers on the social media platform X that he thinks the memecoin Pudgy Penguins ( PENGU ) will rise about 66% from current levels before completing a five-wave surge. Bluntz practices the Elliott Wave theory, which states that a bullish asset tends to witness a five-wave rally. Says the trader, “PENGU has been a standout leader over the last week, now looking like it’s in quite an obvious wave three to the upside here on the daily. Anticipate this to test prior all-time highs and potentially beyond over the next month or so. Has insane normie appeal and basically launched in a meme bear market, so it never had a proper price discovery run, but I think its time has come.” Source: Bluntz/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that PENGU will soar to $0.055. At time of writing, PENGU is worth $0.0327. Another memecoin on the trader’s radar is Bonk ( BONK ), which he thinks is following in the footsteps of PENGU. “From all the major memes, BONK and PENGU are two of the strongest that have taken out their major may high resistances already. Fortunately, PENGU is leading and showing the way for BONK over the coming weeks. I am long both of these coins.” Source: Bluntz/X The trader appears to be predicting that BONK will soar to $0.000043. At time of writing, BONK is trading at $0.00003. As for the broader altcoin market, the trader says he’s keeping an eye on the Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) chart, which tracks how much of the crypto market cap belongs to BTC . Bluntz hints that the bearish divergence on the Bitcoin dominance chart is now playing out, suggesting that altcoins are poised to rise faster than BTC in the current bullish environment. A bearish divergence is a signal indicating waning momentum for an asset or index. “BTC.D proper breaking down now, love to see it.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, BTC.D is hovering at 63.73%.

2025-07-16T14:30:09,"Strategy's preferred equity placements are riding a bullish momentum","Strategy (MSTR) revealed a shift in its fundraising, as buyers moved onto its preferred equity placements. The ATM program for STRK, STRF, and STRD saw increased demand, rising to a record during the past week’s fundraising round. The Saylor-led firm noted a shift in its fundraising playbook, as it continues to build up its BTC treasury. After renewing its weekly purchases , Strategy noted that interest in its preferred shares increased. Last week’s market record demand for all three of the preferred stocks shows the firm’s shares are back in the spotlight, extending the BTC purchasing period. Strategy reported that preferred shares contributed $141M to last week’s raise, where the company acquired 4,225 BTC. Our preferred equity ATMs are seeing record demand. $141M raised last week. $STRK $STRF $STRD pic.twitter.com/QVWYbL2161 — Strategy (@Strategy) July 16, 2025 Strategy started to shift its capital raise to preferred shares in the past month. Last week was the first raise to include all types of preferred shares, as STRD offers were finally taken up by the market. Strategy pauses MSTR raises to improve balance Strategy resorted to its preferred shares to slow down the dilution of its MSTR common stock. For the past two weekly raises, the Saylor-led firm did not issue new MSTR shares in its ATM program. Following a two-week pause of new MSTR issues, combined with a record BTC rally, MSTR rose to a yearly high at $442.13. MSTR trades near its yearly peak, after a two-week pause in new share issuance and dilution. | Source: Google Finance The decision helped narrow the gap between the company’s share price and the value of its BTC holdings. When the share price gets too close to the underlying asset value, the ATM sales become less attractive. MSTR sales are successful when presenting a premium and serve as a proxy for BTC investments. As BTC posted records above $122,000 and held around $118,000, Strategy may be able to tap the MSTR ATM program in the coming weeks. As of July, Strategy has used up to 50% of its MSTR ATM program, with allocations intended to last until 2030. The firm has already acquired 3% of the BTC supply, hoping to hold for the long term. Strategy preferred shares get a boost from yield demand Strategy’s preferred shares offer the potential for dividend payouts, satisfying demand for high-yield products. Some of the preferred shares are riskier, but still inspire demand. The three types of preferred equity were issued in January, March, and June, helping Strategy in its record expansion in 2025. STRF remains the least risky preferred stock, with a 10% yield and higher priority compared to STRK and STRD. STRF traded at $117, rising toward a record during the recent fundraise. Recently, STRF peaked at $126.48. STRK offers 8% yield, and is second in seniority in the case of redemption. STRK peaked at $125.75, later sliding to $118.13. The preferred shares have been trading above their $100 par since June, leading Strategy to expand its preferred share offers each week. One of the biggest sources of liquidity will be the $21B sale program for STRK. STRD is the latest addition to preferred shares, currently trading at $93.28. The new facility offers non-mandatory, non-cumulative dividends, though at a higher yield rate compared to STRF and STRK.

2025-07-16T14:27:41,"Ethereum to $10K? DeepSeek’s Latest ETH Forecast Will Surprise You","Is the current $3.1K price tag just the beginning for the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency? Ethereum ($ETH) could be on track to hit $10K, according to a recent forecast from DeepSeek AI, a China-based artificial intelligence firm. The prediction has ignited fresh debate among investors about whether $ETH is entering a new era of growth – or if the market is simply getting ahead of itself. And there’s the normal question of whether or not AI knows what it’s talking about, of course. DeepSeek AI Issues Bullish Forecast Recently, China-based DeepSeek AI suggested that Ethereum may surpass its previous all-time high of $4.9K by the end of Q3 2025 (it’s currently down 35% from that ATH). After breaking the $4.9K mark, $ETH could make a run toward the $10K mark. The forecast points to Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake, increased adoption of Layer-2 scaling solutions, and steady deployment of key upgrades like Pectra as catalysts for this dramatic price move. Crucially, DeepSeek isn’t the only expert to make the $10K prediction. EMJ Capital Sees Ethereum to $10K – And Beyond Eric Jackson of EMJ Capital points to a number of pending changes that aren’t already priced in, even with Ethereum’s latest gains. That means the true bull run hasn’t started yet, at least for $ETH. Most important of all the coming changes is the pending $ETH ETF approval. While the crypto world waits for the SEC to approve spot $ETH ETFs with staking and yield generation offerings, traditional spot $ETH ETFS marked over a week of positive inflows. What would make yield-bearing crypto ETFs such a big deal? In part, the enhanced ETFs would be a powerful alternative to the currently more popular Bitcoin ETFs. But as Jackson pointed out, it’s not about the simple earning potential of the underlying tokens. Ethereum yield ETFs could provide genuine integration with traditional finance. Jackson sees the next leg of Ethereum’s rally as coming from staking-enabled ETFs, which may launch by October 2025. A staking ETF offering 3.5% yield on top of price appreciation could create a supply crunch and drive $ETH demand to unprecedented levels, as Jackson pointed out. DeepSeek: Ethereum $8K-$12K By 2025, $20K After? DeepSeek shares Jackson’s viewpoints, but see a few potential risks: Regulatory Uncertainty – With Crypto Week underway, regularity clarity is improving, but any delays could still hinder development. Competition – Solana, Cardano, and other L1s could erode Ethereum’s dominance. Macro Downturn – A broader global recession or crypto winter could suppress prices. Technical Risks – Bugs, delays, or failures in upgrades could hinder future scalability improvements. Beyond those hindrances, some experts urge caution. DeepSeek’s earlier projection of $8K- $12K for Q1 2025 has not materialized, and Ethereum remains in the $3K range. A major correction in tech equities or tighter monetary policy could stall Ethereum’s progress. There are also concerns about the centralization risks inherent in proof-of-stake systems and whether Ethereum’s scalability upgrades can keep pace with surging demand. Don’t let Ethereum’s march to $10K distract you entirely; there’s another token with limitless potential lurking just beneath the surface. TOKEN6900 ($T6900) – The Best Crypto Presale and the Essence of Meme Coin Mania Let’s get a few things out of the way: Token 6900 ($T6900) isn’t a utility token in any way, shape, or form. There’s no crypto wallet, no exchange, no P2E game. There’s not even an NFT. There is a meme, a mood, and a vibe. The SPX6900 meme coin sits at $1.81 with a similar lack of utility. In fact, SPX6900 is up 20% in a week, riding the wave of more practical cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum. But Token 6900 is better than $SPX6900. The vibe is better, the timing is better, and the tokenomics is better. After all, $T6900 has a whole 1 token advantage over $SPX6900, a sure sign of a superior project. If all this sounds crazy, you’re in the right place. $T6900 is a wild token for wild times – and it could just be the best play for the crypto bull run. Embrace the old-school, cluttered visual aesthetic. Embrace the independence from the financial system. Embrace Token 6900 (learn how to buy $T6900 in our guide ). Visit the Token 6900 website today . A Pivotal Moment for Ethereum As Ethereum reaches multi-month highs, the stage is set for a crucial few months. If staking-enabled ETFs are approved and Layer-2 adoption accelerates, ETH could accelerate rapidly toward the $10K milestone.

2025-07-16T14:24:46,"Bitcoin, others see gains on Genius Act hopes","Crypto prices jumped Wednesday after President Donald Trump said a vote to approve two long-stalled bills would happen later today. The announcement came less than 24 hours after Republicans in the House blocked progress on both the GENIUS Act and the CLARITY Act, which together would reshape crypto regulation across the United States. Bitcoin, others see gains on Genius Act hopes According to CNBC, several GOP lawmakers reversed their opposition following a late-night White House meeting, clearing the way for what Trump now says will be final votes. Bitcoin climbed 2% to $119,114.79, recovering most of its Tuesday losses. Ether rose 3% to $3,156. The broader market rallied too. Circle rose 5%, and Coinbase added 2% after both closed lower the previous day. Smaller names saw bigger gains. BitMine and SharpLink, two stocks tied to ether treasuries, each gained around 14%. Bit Digital went up 13%. All of them had dipped earlier when the House failed to advance the bills. The GENIUS Act has already passed the Senate. It focuses on stablecoins and would prohibit issuers from paying interest to users. If passed, it would give even more weight to the Ethereum network, which underpins many stablecoin applications used by large institutions. The second bill, the CLARITY Act, deals with broader market structure rules. Unlike the GENIUS Act, it hasn’t yet made it to a vote. Players like Coinbase were pushing for both bills to pass together, but it’s still unclear if that will happen. Owen Lau, an analyst at Oppenheimer, said the market overreacted to Tuesday’s delay. “It’s not such bad news, which is why the stocks [Coinbase and Circle] recovered in late trading,” Owen told CNBC. He added that while prices may stay bumpy until the vote happens, the bills are still expected to pass eventually. “Both stocks may be under pressure until we get the vote, but these bills will eventually get passed after these negotiations.” According to Owen, whether the bills are passed as a pair or separately won’t affect the long-term value much. However, bundling them would give markets quicker clarity by cutting out months of political stalling. Institutions keep pouring in Ether’s rally, though impressive, isn’t backed by much on-chain growth. Markus Thielen, head of research at 10x Research, said the recent surge was driven by hype and positioning. “Active addresses remain flat, network revenue is unchanged, and gas [transaction] fees have only ticked up slightly,” Markus said. Despite those weak fundamentals, ether has doubled in price in just three months, riding on growing stablecoin interest and the buzz around ether treasuries. Bitcoin’s rise hasn’t been smooth either. The coin fell earlier in the week after over $360 million worth of leveraged long positions were liquidated on Monday. That liquidation dragged the price down briefly after Bitcoin hit an all-time high above $120,000. But after Trump’s post, the coin rebounded again. Money keeps flowing in from institutions. On Tuesday, Bitcoin ETFs took in $402.99 million, while ether funds pulled in $192.3 million, showing that big investors are still loading up even as Washington keeps dragging its feet.

2025-07-16T14:17:41,"XRP Ledger Hits 7.18M Wallets as Canada’s Top ETF Surpasses $50M AUM","The XRP Ledger (XRPL) has crossed 7.18 million registered addresses, marking a major adoption milestone. At the same time, Canada’s 3iQ XRP ETF has surged past $50 million in assets under management, signaling growing institutional confidence in the XRP ecosystem. Rising Institutional & Developer Engagement Over the past year, the XRP Ledger has drawn increasing interest from financial institutions and developers. Coinbase's launch of XRP futures and rising volumes on regulated exchanges like the CME Group to the tune of $542 million in the first month have created a robust framework for large-scale adoption. Meanwhile, the XRP ecosystem has expanded as developers launch new payment rails, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, and non-fungible tokens (NFT) marketplaces on XRPL, driving both on‑chain transfers and address registration. Source: CryptoQuant Higher Token Utility & Consumer Awareness The migration of XRP into new use cases, such as cross-border payments, remittances, and even strategic crypto reserves, has fueled public and institutional awareness. Notably, XRP was included alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano in a U.S. national crypto reserve plan announced in early 2025. Such high-profile validation has likely inspired both retail and corporate users to explore XRPL, leading to a growing base of unique addresses. UX Improvements & Wallet Launches There has been a surge of user-friendly wallet apps tailored for XRPL—including mobile, desktop, and embeddable non‑custodial options. This proliferation, along with simplified KYC processes by exchanges and fiat-on-ramp platforms, lowered barriers, helping onboard millions of new users. Demand for XRP ETF Skyrockets in Canada Canada’s largest XRP-focused ETF continues to witness soaring demand with asset under management (AUM) breaching $50 million. Taking on X, formerly Twitter, 3iQ Digital Asset Management, pointed out , “We are proud to announce that our XRP ETF (TSX: XRPQ, XRPQ.U), Canada’s largest XRP ETF, has accumulated over 50 million USD in client assets since its launch on June 18th.” According to Pascal St-Jean, the 3iQ XRP ETF president and CEO, this milestone underscores rising demand for digital assets, as both retail and institutional investors seek smarter allocations. He added that its 0% launch management fee and ETF flexibility stand in sharp contrast to the high premiums of earlier crypto funds, making it a compelling choice for cost-conscious investors. Notably, 3iQ wowed investors by waiving its management fee for the first six months, making XRPQ one of the most competitively priced crypto ETFs in North America. This aggressive pricing lowered the barrier to entry for retail and institutional investors alike. Furthermore, the 3iQ launch capitalized on Canada’s position as a progressive hub for spot crypto ETFs, joining Purpose Investments , which debuted its own XRP vehicle concurrently. Conclusion The impressive AUM milestone not only validates 3iQ’s strategy, but also signals a broader trend, which is a shift toward regulated, cost‑efficient crypto investing. With regulatory skies clearing and institutional legitimacy increasing, the XRP ETF model may soon become a blueprint for future crypto investment vehicles, paving the way for broader adoption far beyond Canada’s borders. Additionally, the combination of institutional engagement, increased transaction volume, new on‑chain products, and active whale movements has created a self-reinforcing loop for the XRP Ledger. As developers continue building new services, especially around payments and tokenized assets, and regulators embrace XRP’s liquidity and utility, both address counts and on‑chain usage are set for further expansion as XRPL and XRP ETFs take center stage.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9955/xrp-ledger-hits-7-18-m-wallets-as-canada-s-top-etf-surpasses-50-m-aum,"XRP|WALLET|BUSINESS|ADA|BTC","News|Ripple",cryptocompare

According to TokenInsight’s latest Exchange Report, total crypto market capitalization climbed to $3.46 trillion by quarter-end, up 28.2% from Q1. However, exchange activity failed to keep pace with the broader recovery, as cautious sentiment, limited altcoin participation, and macroeconomic headwinds dragged down trading volumes. Trading Volume Down Despite Bitcoin Surge TokenInsight reports that the total trading volume across the top 10 crypto exchanges reached $21.6 trillion in Q2, a 6.16% decline from the previous quarter. 1/ The Top 10 exchanges total $21.58T in volume, a decrease of 6.16% compared to the previous quarter. pic.twitter.com/Ue57kdpUP0 — TokenInsight (@TokenInsight) July 16, 2025 While Bitcoin rallied from $83,000 to over $111,000 before closing near $106,000, the rest of the market saw uneven performance. Liquidity remained concentrated in a few large-cap assets, with many altcoins continuing to see low activity and sharp drops in interest. The spot market, in particular, experienced a marked pullback: average daily spot trading volume declined from $51 billion in Q1 to $40 billion in Q2. Total spot volume across major exchanges reached $3.63 trillion, a 21.7% drop quarter-on-quarter. Derivatives trading fared slightly better, reaching $20.2 trillion, down 3.6% from Q1. This segment remained more resilient as traders sought to hedge volatility and manage risk amid ongoing geopolitical tensions and sluggish global growth. The average daily derivatives trading volume fell to $226 billion, compared to $233 billion in Q1, reflecting broader market caution. Binance Leads, But Market Share is Shifting Binance retains its lead in total trading volume with a 35.39% share, though this reflected a slight decrease from Q1. Other exchanges gained ground: OKX, Bitget, HTX, Gate, and KuCoin all expanded their market shares during the quarter. Gate posted the largest gain with a 2.55% increase, followed by OKX with 1.08%. In the open interest market, Binance strengthened its position with a 0.36% increase, reaching a 23.83% share. Bitget, OKX, and HTX also made modest gains. The data shows a gradual diversification in user behavior, as smaller platforms continue to attract more trading volume despite the broader slowdown in market activity. Exchange Tokens Lag Behind Bitcoin Rally While Bitcoin surged 31.62% during Q2, exchange-related tokens underperformed. BNB led the pack with an 8.91% gain, followed by modest increases in OKB, BGB, and KCS. Most other exchange tokens posted declines, reflecting waning interest in altcoin markets. As TokenInsight notes, exchange tokens remain closely correlated with altcoin activity, which saw reduced liquidity and volume during the quarter. With persistent macro uncertainty and uneven regulatory developments , Q3 is expected to remain challenging for exchange token performance. TokenInsight anticipates continued divergence in this segment as market participants focus on high-cap assets and remain selective in deploying capital across the exchange sector.

QCP Capital: Bitcoin Pulled Back After Surpassing $120,000, But Market Still Structurally Strong As summer approaches, a seasonal decrease in trading volume is observed in the cryptocurrency market. Another key point highlighted in the report is the 10% depreciation of the dollar index since the beginning of the year. This paves the way for strong performance in dollar-denominated assets, particularly Bitcoin. QCP Capital also noted that Ethereum has recently outperformed Bitcoin. This strengthening is attributed to institutions like SBET, which have taken steps to diversify its Ethereum-based treasuries, and the increasing trend of other companies to increase their Ethereum holdings. Retreat Can Be a Healthy Correction According to the analysis, a pullback to $110,000 could allow Bitcoin to consolidate more robustly in the current uptrend.

2025-07-16T14:00:20,"Bitcoin DeFi Unlocking: Bitlayer’s BitVM Bridge Revolutionizes BTC Integration","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin DeFi Unlocking: Bitlayer’s BitVM Bridge Revolutionizes BTC Integration Imagine the vast, untapped potential of Bitcoin, the world’s most secure and valuable cryptocurrency, finally flowing freely into the dynamic world of decentralized finance (DeFi). For years, Bitcoin has largely remained an isolated giant, its immense liquidity locked away from the burgeoning DeFi ecosystem. Now, a groundbreaking development is set to change that narrative. Bitlayer, a prominent Bitcoin layer-2 network, has launched its innovative BitVM Bridge on the mainnet, promising to usher in a new era for Bitcoin DeFi . This is not just another bridge; it’s a trust-minimized pathway designed to unlock Bitcoin’s true potential within decentralized applications, ensuring security and efficiency. Are you ready to witness how this pivotal innovation could redefine the future of crypto finance? What is the Significance of Bringing Bitcoin DeFi to the Forefront? For too long, Bitcoin, despite its market dominance, has been underutilized in the DeFi space. Most DeFi protocols reside on blockchains like Ethereum or Solana, which offer smart contract capabilities that Bitcoin’s native blockchain does not. To use BTC in DeFi, users often relied on ‘wrapped’ versions of Bitcoin (like WBTC) or centralized custodians, introducing various levels of trust and potential points of failure. This meant that the security and decentralization inherent to Bitcoin were often compromised when it entered DeFi. The significance of truly integrating Bitcoin DeFi lies in several key areas: Unlocking Liquidity: Bitcoin represents hundreds of billions of dollars in dormant capital. Bringing this liquidity into DeFi can supercharge existing protocols and enable entirely new financial products. Enhanced Security: By leveraging Bitcoin’s foundational security, DeFi applications can potentially become more robust and resilient. Increased Decentralization: Reducing reliance on centralized custodians or multi-signature schemes for bridging promotes a more decentralized financial ecosystem, aligning with the core ethos of crypto. New Use Cases: Imagine Bitcoin being seamlessly used as collateral for loans, participating in liquidity pools, or earning yield in a trust-minimized manner. This opens up a universe of possibilities for innovation. Bitlayer’s BitVM Bridge aims to address these challenges head-on, offering a pathway that respects Bitcoin’s security principles while expanding its utility. How Does the BitVM Bridge Work its Magic? At the heart of Bitlayer’s innovation is the BitVM Bridge , which leverages the powerful, albeit complex, concept of BitVM. BitVM, or Bitcoin Virtual Machine, is a revolutionary proposal that allows for the execution of complex computations on Bitcoin without altering its core protocol. It achieves this by proving that a given computation could have been executed on Bitcoin, even if it wasn’t. This is done through a mechanism known as ‘fraud proofs’. Here’s a simplified breakdown of how the BitVM Bridge operates: Locking BTC: When a user wants to bring their BTC into the Bitlayer ecosystem (or another DeFi platform via the bridge), their Bitcoin is locked in a special multi-signature address on the Bitcoin mainnet. This address is controlled by a set of participants, including the user and a designated ‘challenger’ or ‘verifier’. The Role of BitVM Smart Contracts: The bridge utilizes a BitVM smart contract. This isn’t a smart contract in the Ethereum sense, but rather a way to express and verify complex conditions using Bitcoin’s existing scripting language (Script). Trust-Minimized Security: The core innovation is the ‘trust-minimized’ framework. It operates on the assumption that at least one honest participant exists within the system. If any malicious activity occurs (e.g., an attempt to improperly release locked BTC), an honest participant can generate a fraud proof. Fraud Proofs and Dispute Resolution: This fraud proof is a cryptographic proof that demonstrates the malicious behavior. It can be verified on the Bitcoin mainnet, effectively penalizing the dishonest party and ensuring the integrity of the locked funds. This mechanism discourages fraud by making it economically irrational. This approach significantly differs from traditional wrapped BTC solutions, which often rely on a centralized entity or a small consortium of multi-sig signers. The BitVM Bridge shifts the security paradigm towards cryptographic proofs and economic incentives, aligning more closely with Bitcoin’s decentralized ethos. The Role of the Bitlayer Network in This Innovation The Bitlayer network is a Bitcoin layer-2 solution built to scale Bitcoin and enhance its smart contract capabilities. It serves as the environment where the bridged BTC can actually be used in DeFi applications. Think of it as an extension of Bitcoin, providing the infrastructure for faster, cheaper transactions and complex smart contract interactions, all while maintaining a strong connection to Bitcoin’s underlying security. Key aspects of the Bitlayer network’s role: Scalability: By processing transactions off the main Bitcoin chain, Bitlayer reduces congestion and transaction fees, making DeFi activities more accessible and efficient. Smart Contract Compatibility: It provides an environment where smart contracts can operate, enabling the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) that can interact with Bitcoin. Security Inheritance: While a separate layer, Bitlayer aims to inherit as much security from Bitcoin as possible. The BitVM Bridge is a prime example of this, using Bitcoin’s scripting capabilities for dispute resolution. Ecosystem Growth: By facilitating the seamless movement of BTC, the Bitlayer network aims to foster a vibrant ecosystem of DeFi protocols, NFTs, and other decentralized applications built on Bitcoin’s foundation. The synergy between the innovative BitVM Bridge and the robust Bitlayer network is what makes this development so powerful. The bridge gets BTC onto the network, and the network provides the platform for its utility. Why is BTC Bridging So Crucial for Decentralized Finance? For decentralized finance to truly flourish and achieve mainstream adoption, it needs access to the largest pool of cryptocurrency liquidity: Bitcoin. Historically, BTC bridging has been a complex and often centralized endeavor. Early methods involved trusted third parties holding Bitcoin and issuing corresponding tokens on other chains. While effective in the short term, these methods introduced significant counterparty risk and went against the very principles of decentralization that DeFi champions. The advent of trust-minimized BTC bridging solutions, like Bitlayer’s BitVM Bridge, is crucial because: Reduces Centralization Risk: By minimizing the need for trusted intermediaries, the risk of censorship, seizure, or single points of failure is significantly reduced. This makes the entire DeFi ecosystem more resilient. Enhances Capital Efficiency: Unlocking Bitcoin’s liquidity allows for more capital to be deployed in various DeFi protocols, leading to deeper liquidity pools, more stable lending markets, and more efficient trading. Boosts Innovation: Developers can now confidently build DeFi applications knowing they can integrate Bitcoin in a secure and decentralized manner. This fosters a new wave of innovation tailored for Bitcoin holders. Broadens DeFi Participation: Bitcoin maximalists and those wary of complex bridging mechanisms might now be more willing to explore DeFi, expanding the user base and overall adoption. The ability to move BTC across chains securely and efficiently is not just a technical feat; it’s a foundational step towards a more interconnected and robust decentralized financial system. Navigating the Future: Challenges and Opportunities in Decentralized Finance While the launch of the BitVM Bridge is a monumental step forward, the journey for Decentralized Finance , especially with Bitcoin integration, still has its challenges and immense opportunities. Challenges Ahead: Adoption and Education: Explaining complex concepts like BitVM and fraud proofs to a broader audience will be key for widespread adoption. Users need to understand the security guarantees. Scalability of Fraud Proofs: While trust-minimized, the actual generation and verification of fraud proofs on Bitcoin can be resource-intensive. Optimizing this process will be an ongoing challenge. Competition: Other Bitcoin Layer-2s and bridging solutions are also vying for market share. The landscape is competitive, requiring continuous innovation from Bitlayer. Security Audits and Real-World Testing: As with any new technology dealing with significant capital, rigorous security audits and extensive real-world testing are paramount to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities. Regulatory Landscape: The evolving regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies and DeFi could impact the growth and operational models of such bridges. Opportunities on the Horizon: New Financial Primitives: The ability to use native BTC opens the door for entirely new DeFi products and services that were previously impossible or too risky. Cross-Chain Interoperability: This development paves the way for greater interoperability between Bitcoin and other major blockchain ecosystems, creating a more unified crypto space. Increased Market Efficiency: By bringing more liquidity and more secure assets into DeFi, the overall market can become more efficient and robust. Mainstream Acceptance: As DeFi becomes more secure and accessible with Bitcoin integration, it increases its appeal to institutional investors and traditional finance, accelerating mainstream acceptance. The integration of Bitcoin into DeFi via solutions like the BitVM Bridge represents a pivotal moment, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in the decentralized economy. A New Horizon for Bitcoin’s Utility The launch of Bitlayer’s BitVM Bridge on the mainnet marks a significant milestone in the evolution of both Bitcoin and decentralized finance. By providing a truly trust-minimized framework for bringing BTC into DeFi, it addresses long-standing challenges and unlocks immense potential. No longer will Bitcoin be seen merely as a store of value, but also as a dynamic asset capable of fueling a new generation of decentralized applications. This innovation paves the way for greater liquidity, enhanced security, and unprecedented opportunities for developers and users alike. The journey of Bitcoin DeFi is just beginning, and with pioneering solutions like the BitVM Bridge, the future looks incredibly bright and interconnected.

The analyst noted that DOGE previously reached this Fibonacci level, which suggests it may do so again in this cycle. Dogecoin Price Eyes Rally Above $10 With This Fibonacci Level In an X post, DOGECAPITAL predicted that the Dogecoin price could rally above $10 if it reaches the 423.6% Fibonacci level. The analyst used the Fibonacci tool to highlight the fact that both the first and second DOGE cycles topped at the 423.6% level. Based on this, the foremost meme coin could reach this level, surpassing the $10 target. Related Reading: Dogecoin Returns To December 2020 Levels, Is Another 36,000% Rally Possible? Interestingly, DOGECAPITAL noted that should history repeat itself, the Dogecoin price could rally to as high as $36, which is where the 423.6% is. This could mark the potential top for the meme coin in this cycle. The analyst also confirmed that DOGE is nowhere near its top in this third cycle based on the historical timing of past cycles. If this historical pattern keeps playing out, DOGECAPITAL predicts that the projected top for the Dogecoin price could occur around the final week of October. The analyst also believes that the market has entered DOGE season with Bitcoin reaching new all-time highs (ATHs) and the meme coin currently sitting near key support. However, despite the current bullish sentiment in the crypto market, it is worth noting that the Dogecoin price is still sitting just below the psychological $0.2 level. As such, this raises doubts about whether the DOGE season has truly begun. Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade stated that the DOGE/BTC chart may show a God candle this season, which would kickstart the DOGE season. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Kevin Capital noted that the DOGE/BTC chart is sitting in a historical zone of support. He added that the monthly time frame indicators are also fully reset, providing the best setup for the Dogecoin price. DOGE Eyes Rally To $0.25 In The Short Term In an X post, crypto analyst Ali Martinez predicted that the Dogecoin price could rally to $0.25 in the short term. Alluding to DOGE’s daily chart, Martinez stated that the meme coin is trading within a channel and that it just bounced off the bottom. He added that a buying spike at this level could send DOGE to the top of the channel at $0.25. Related Reading: Analysts Predict Major Dogecoin Price Rally After Breaking 50-Day Trendline This level is significant as it marked the last local top for the Dogecoin price. As such, a successful break above this level could lead to higher prices for the meme coin. Meanwhile, Trader Tardigrade stated that DOGE’s daily RSI might find support soon, completing a healthy pullback and preparing for a new surge. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.19, up over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

SEC approves UXRP, the first U.S.-listed leveraged XRP ETF, set to launch on NYSE Arca. 3iQ’s Canadian XRP ETF tops $50M in assets as regulated products gain traction globally. XRP Futures Set New Record on CME CME’s XRP futures market posted its highest trading volume to date on July 11. Over $235 million in notional value changed hands in a single day, with volume spread across standard and micro contracts. This brings the total traded volume since the May 19 launch to over $1.6 billion. The contracts offer exposure to XRP without requiring token ownership. The standard contract is based on 50,000 XRP, while the micro version covers 2,500 coins. These cash-settled products are tied to CME’s XRP-Dollar Reference Rate and are available to both institutions and retail traders. Institutions Turn to Regulated Exposure CME has become a go-to exchange for investors who want access to crypto through regulated markets. Its Bitcoin and Ether futures are already widely used, and XRP is now following a similar path. The latest numbers suggest growing use of XRP futures among trading firms. CME’s Active Trader account posted , “XRP and Micro XRP futures crossed $235M notional traded on July 11.” That day, over 9,100 contracts were traded, equal to more than 82 million XRP. Micro contracts also saw their busiest session since launch. Ripple, which uses XRP for international payments, is applying for a banking license in the United States. It is also looking to register under the MiCA framework in the European Union. These moves are part of a broader strategy to build compliant infrastructure for XRP in major markets. XRP Gets First U.S. ETF as Global Demand Grows XRP futures aren’t the only regulated product gaining traction. On July 14, 3iQ reported that its XRP ETF, trading on Canada’s TSX, crossed $50 million in assets. CME data also shows that 45% of XRP futures volume comes from outside North America, pointing to strong demand across regions. Adding to this institutional wave, the SEC has approved the ProShares Ultra XRP ETF, a leveraged futures-based product set to trade under the ticker UXRP on NYSE Arca. Trading is scheduled to begin by week’s end, giving XRP its first U.S.-listed ETF exposure.

2025-07-16T13:54:27,"Bitcoin ETFs Just Pulled Off a $7.78B Inflow Streak Since July 9th","Bitcoin experienced a typical pullback after hitting a new all-time high above $123K this week, briefly dipping before recovering to $118K on Wednesday. Despite this pause in its rally, strong institutional interest remains clear, as consistent inflows into Bitcoin ETFs continued to support market confidence and the broader bullish momentum. Bitcoin ETFs Are Soaking Up Fiat Market intelligence platform Santiment revealed that there has been a surge of capital moving into Bitcoin ETFs as the top crypto asset trades in new territory. Since June 9, these investment vehicles have recorded a combined net inflow of $7.78 billion, averaging $353.8 million daily. Glassnode also observed that Monday marked one of the largest daily inflows to the spot Bitcoin ETFs in the past three months, with over 7,500 BTC added in a single day. What’s striking is Tuesday’s follow-through, as institutions showed no hesitation, adding another 3,400 BTC or around $402 million in net inflows, despite the previous day’s surge. This also represented nine consecutive days of consistent buying pressure. According to data updated by SoSoValue, BlackRock’s IBIT was the top performer as it captured $416.35 million in net inflows. Next up was VanEck’s HODL, which added $19 million, while Grayscale’s Mini Bitcoin Trust and Bitwise’s BITB also saw $18.56 million and $12.7 million, respectively. This steady influx of fiat into the funds aligns with on-chain whale accumulation, which, according to Santiment, is contributing to Bitcoin’s record-setting all-time high levels and demonstrates the growing appetite for institutional exposure to BTC amid its historic rally. Bitcoin Could Hit $200K on Global Institutional Inflows If global institutional inflows alone enter the market, Bitcoin could rise another 70% to approach $200,000, as per an update by Kobeissi Letter. With Bitcoin delivering a 90% CAGR over the past 13 years, even conservative funds are allocating 1% to BTC as treasury adoption gains momentum. Kobeissi noted that with $31 trillion in institutional AUM in the US, a 1% allocation could inject $300 billion into Bitcoin. This, in turn, could drive prices to around $133,000, a widely cited short-term target. Factoring in global institutional AUM, a $1 trillion inflow could add 70% to Bitcoin’s price, thereby pushing it closer to $200,000, all without retail participation. As more institutional products launch and entities accumulate BTC for treasuries, experts believe that Bitcoin’s upward trajectory will continue.

Total trading volume across the top 10 exchanges reached $21.6 trillion despite declining 6.16%. Binance held a 35.39% market share, while five exchanges posted gains. Crypto market capitalization rebounded to $3.46 trillion, marking 28.2% quarterly growth. Binance maintains dominant position Binance held 35.39% trading volume share in Q2 2025, marking a slight decline from Q1. The exchange dropped 1.18% from the previous quarter’s 36.57% market share. Nevertheless, Binance remained the only exchange consistently capturing over one-third of market share. OKX secured second position with 14.34% market share, posting 1.08% quarter-on-quarter growth. The exchange increased from 13.26% in Q1 2025, showing steady market expansion. Bybit maintained third position with 12.20%, declining 0.80% from the previous quarter. Bitget held 11.45% market share with 0.14% growth from Q1’s 11.31% position. MEXC posted an 11.45% share, declining 1.58% from 13.03% in Q1 2025. Gate achieved the largest market share increase, rising 2.55% to 7.95%. Source: TokenInsight BingX recorded 2.17% market share, a 0.17% decline from Q1 levels. HTX maintained 2.64% share, posting 0.51% growth quarter-on-quarter. Coinbase held 1.06% market share, declining 0.62% from the previous quarter. KuCoin maintained a 1.29% market share with 0.05% growth from its Q1 position. Five exchanges saw market share growth during the Q2 2025 period. Gate led gains followed by OKX with substantial quarter-on-quarter improvements. Total trading volume reached $21.6 trillion across the top 10 exchanges combined. The volume declined 6.16% from Q1 despite Bitcoin’s recovery to $106,000 by the end of the quarter. Market conditions drive trading volume decline Bitcoin rose from $83,000 to peak at $111,900, ending the quarter near $106,000. Most other assets saw limited recovery, with altcoins experiencing sharp liquidity drops. Trading activity declined across many alternative cryptocurrencies during the quarter. Crypto market capitalization rebounded to approximately $3.46 trillion by Q2’s end. The recovery marked a 28.2% quarter-on-quarter increase following Q1’s deep correction. ETF product inflows and Bitcoin rally primarily drove market recovery. Federal Reserve rate cut expectations and improving employment data supported sentiment. However, geopolitical tensions and sluggish global growth limited a broader rebound. Ongoing macro uncertainty and slow regulatory progress weighed on activity. Cautious investor sentiment continued affecting trading volumes across exchanges consistently. For the second consecutive quarter, the market’s volume performance declined. Volumes could stay low in the absence of robust inflows or new policy support. In the first quarter, spot trade volume was $51 billion per day; now, it is $40 billion. Spot trading totaled $3.63 trillion, a 21.7% decrease from $4.6 trillion in Q1. Derivatives trading stats fell 3.6% from the previous quarter to $20.2 trillion. The average daily trade of derivatives decreased from $233 billion to $226 billion. Exchange tokens showed mixed performance Exchange tokens showed mixed performance in Q2 2025 with all major tokens underperforming Bitcoin . Bitcoin gained 31.62% while exchange tokens failed to show similar momentum. BNB recorded the highest gain among exchange tokens at 8.91% quarterly. OKB, BGB, and KCS posted modest increases during the quarter. Most other major exchange tokens experienced declines across the timeframe. Exchange token performance remained closely tied to struggling altcoin market conditions. Bitcoin rallied strongly, backed by spot ETF inflows and regulatory clarity. Exchange tokens failed to benefit from the same institutional momentum. During Q2, there was a noticeable drop in altcoin market trading activity and liquidity. Exchange token performance from TokenInsight In Q2 2025, spot trading share continued to fall on most exchanges. With a 2.70% gain in spot share, MEXC had the biggest growth, followed by Bitget. In the face of uncertainty, traders continued to choose high-frequency derivatives trading in Q1. The goal of trading derivatives was to leverage market volatility and manage risks. The pattern showed that spot markets had a more severe decline than derivatives. Binance maintained its leading open interest position with a 23.83% average market share. The exchange increased 0.36% from Q1’s 23.47% open interest share. HTX, Bitget, and OKX recorded the largest open interest gains at 1.19%, 0.71%, and 0.63%.

2025-07-16T13:45:30,"If XRP ends the week at this level, it will hit a record high of $4.8","Cryptocurrency trading expert Ali Martinez is projecting that XRP could rally to a new all-time high near $5, provided the token secures a decisive weekly close. Martinez noted that XRP is showing renewed strength on the weekly chart, emphasizing that breaching $3 would serve as the key catalyst for a breakout to new highs at $4.9, he said in an X post on July 16. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView The analysis highlighted that XRP has repeatedly tested the $3 mark since early 2025 but has consistently failed to close above it, reinforcing its role as a major resistance level. However, recent price action shows a shift in momentum, with XRP forming higher lows since bottoming near $1.90 in April. The steep rally into mid-July, which saw XRP briefly reclaim $3, suggests strong buying interest, putting the token on the brink of a critical breakout. Now, if buyers can push the price above $3 and hold it through the weekly close, the setup would confirm a bullish continuation, targeting $4.80, which is nearly 60% above current levels. XRP fundamentals Overall, XRP has been on a bullish run in line with broader market sentiment, driven by Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) rally to a record high above $123,000. This momentum has helped XRP reclaim its position as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The rally also follows the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s decision in late June to drop its appeal in the long-running case against Ripple, ending four years of legal uncertainty. Both parties are now exploring a settlement pending court approval. Adding to the optimism, Ripple applied on July 2 for a federal bank charter with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, signaling an ambitious move into regulated financial services. Investor interest is also rising, with eleven asset managers filing for spot XRP ETFs and ProShares launching leveraged products tied to the token. XRP price analysis At press time, XRP was trading at $2.96, up 3% on the day and nearly 24% over the past week. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold The price is well above its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) at $2.29 and 200-day SMA near $1.80, confirming strong bullish momentum. However, with a 14-day RSI of 80.62 signaling extreme overbought conditions, the market risks a short-term pullback that could limit its ability to break and hold above the key $3 level decisively.

2025-07-16T13:44:57,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Bullish Momentum Returns After Recent Correction, Is $140K Next?","Bitcoin is currently trading around $119K after reaching a new all-time high above $123K just days ago. This historic breakout has come with aggressive momentum, flipping prior resistance levels into strong support. The overall structure remains bullish, but recent price action shows early signs of a potential short-term exhaustion. By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart On the daily chart, BTC has respected its macro bullish channel and just broke out from a large bull flag formation that had been developing for several weeks. This continuation pattern came after a steep rally from the April lows around 75K and was followed by a clean breakout above the 108K resistance zone. Once BTC cleared that level, momentum accelerated rapidly, with the price pushing through the key 114K resistance level and tapping $123K, forming new all-time highs. The bullish structure remains intact, with higher highs and higher lows forming clearly. BTC is now sitting below the dotted trendline that marks the midline of the multi-month ascending channel. This midline zone could be the target of this price rally, as the market might reach and test it around $140K. Another critical observation on the daily chart is the confluence between the breakout and the moving averages. The asset is holding well above both the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, which are slowly curving upward. This suggests strong underlying demand and trend continuation. If BTC does retrace, the 110K zone stands out as the primary support block, not only due to recent price memory but also because it aligns with recent major highs. The 4-Hour Chart Zooming in on the 4-hour timeframe, BTC is testing the $118K–$119K bearish fair value gap, which is now acting as resistance. After the sharp rally toward $121K, the price has pulled back modestly, forming a small range just under the bearish FVG. The RSI has also cooled down from overbought levels and now sits around 58, suggesting there’s still room for more upside in the short term. However, the recent rejection from the $123K highs shows that some local resistance is forming. This could lead to short-term distribution unless bulls reclaim this bearish FVG convincingly. Yet, below the current price, several clean bullish FVGs exist, starting at $114K and extending down to $111K. These are prime zones to watch for long setups if BTC dips further. They mark strong, unmitigated demand areas where the price rallied impulsively with little resistance. A drop into these zones, followed by bullish price action (like a sweep and reclaim), would offer high-probability continuation opportunities toward 125K and beyond. Sentiment Analysis Bitcoin Retail Activity Surge One of the most telling on-chain signals right now is the surge in retail trading activity, as measured by the Bitcoin Spot Retail Activity Through Trading Frequency indicator. This metric evaluates the relative increase in retail participation based on changes from the one-year moving average. Historically, surges in this metric, especially when it turns red, have coincided with major pivots, mostly indicating overheated conditions and excessive euphoria. Right now, the chart is not showing red signals, meaning retail participation is still average. This indicates that retail traders and investors are yet to flood the market and chase the price, at least not to the extent that they have during previous all-time highs. This suggests that the price could still rise sustainably if other factors, especially the futures market metrics, remain stable.

2025-07-16T13:43:09,"Arizona, Texas, and Utah Named Blockchain Policy “Trailblazers” in US","Arizona, Texas, and Utah have emerged as leaders in cryptocurrency regulation in the United States, according to the latest “Tokenized in America” report by Chainlink and the Blockchain Association . Key Takeaways: Arizona, Texas, and Utah lead the US in crypto regulation, earning “trailblazer” status. Over half of the US states have strong congressional support for blockchain. State-level momentum builds alongside federal efforts during “Crypto Week.” These states have been recognized as “trailblazers” for their friendly blockchain policies and growing ecosystems. The report assessed states on several factors, including government-led blockchain pilot projects, active pro-crypto task forces, and legislative support. Concentration of blockchain-related workforce, strategic Bitcoin reserve initiatives, and membership in the North American Blockchain Association (NABA) were also determining factors. Arizona, Texas, and Utah Lead with Strong Regulatory Clarity Arizona, Texas, and Utah scored highest, reflecting a strong commitment to fostering crypto innovation and regulatory clarity. “Texas, Arizona, and Utah earned Trailblazer status for their strength in both policy and ecosystem development,” the report noted. Other states like North Carolina, California, New Hampshire, and Wyoming also showed notable progress across multiple categories. Adam Minehardt, Chainlink Labs’ head of policy, emphasized that while federal crypto regulation receives most attention, significant momentum is building at the state level. He described the report as shedding light on states’ vital roles in shaping digital asset opportunities and challenges ahead. Currently, more than half of U.S. states have robust congressional support for blockchain policy, and over a third operate dedicated pro-crypto task forces. ARIZONA SIGNS STRATEGIC BITCOIN RESERVE INTO LAW! pic.twitter.com/xQXsm2fEXQ — Dennis Porter (@Dennis_Porter_) May 8, 2025 About 22% run blockchain pilot programs, while 16% are pursuing strategic Bitcoin reserve initiatives, signaling growing institutional interest at the regional level. This surge in state-level activity coincides with the U.S. government’s “Crypto Week,” which aims to pass three crucial bills to enhance industry standards and clarify regulatory frameworks. These include the GENIUS Act for stablecoin innovation, the CLARITY Act focused on digital asset market regulation , and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act opposing a central bank digital currency. While industry insiders admit the CLARITY Act has imperfections, its potential passage could position the U.S. as a global leader in digital asset policy. Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Hit Record $91 Billion in 2025 Corporate interest in Bitcoin surged in Q2 2025, with companies adding a record 159,107 BTC valued at over $17.6 billion. This marked a 23.13% rise from the previous quarter and brought total corporate holdings to 847,000 BTC, about 4% of the capped 21 million supply, according to Bitwise Asset Management. The total value of corporate Bitcoin treasuries soared to $91 billion by the end of June, driven by Bitcoin’s price increase of nearly 61% over the quarter. Public companies holding Bitcoin also jumped sharply, with 46 new entrants raising the total number of firms to 125, a 58.23% quarter-on-quarter increase. Leading corporate holders include Michael Saylor’s Strategy with 597,325 BTC, driving strong stock performance with a 43% year-to-date gain. Bitcoin miner MARA Holdings holds nearly 50,000 BTC, while newcomers like Twenty One and Metaplanet have also made significant purchases .

2025-07-16T13:40:23,"Ripple Price Analysis: Will XRP Break All-Time High Levels in This Aggressive Rally?","XRP has finally come alive after a prolonged period of consolidation and underperformance relative to other major crypto assets. Over the past two weeks, Ripple’s token has broken out from long-standing patterns against both USD and BTC, shifting market structure and flipping critical resistances into support. The breakout is not only technical, it’s aggressive, with surging momentum and elevated RSI levels, hinting at the return of speculation and perhaps early signs of a narrative forming around XRP again. But how sustainable is this rally? Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The USDT Pair The XRPUSDT chart is showing a powerful breakout above $2.30 after months of sideways action. The price broke out of a falling wedge pattern that had been forming since late 2024. The wedge breakout was accompanied by a strong bullish candle that closed well above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, both located around the $2.30 zone. XRP is now pushing into a major resistance area at $3.00, a zone that previously acted as a supply ceiling multiple times during the past year. The rally has been sharp, and the RSI has entered extremely overbought territory at 80. Historically, such RSI spikes have led to corrections or sideways consolidation before continuation. As long as XRP holds above the 100-day and 200-day moving averages in the coming days, the path toward $3.40 and even $4.00 opens up. However, a close below the MAs could trigger profit-taking and drag the price back below $2.00. The BTC Pair The XRP/BTC pair also confirms this momentum shift. The price has broken out of a falling wedge structure and flipped the key 2,200 SAT range into support. This is significant, as XRP had been trending downward against BTC for the majority of 2025. The breakout invalidates the bearish market structure and suggests a new trend phase could be developing. Currently sitting around 2,500 SAT, XRP/BTC is testing its 200-day moving average and is trying to make higher highs and higher lows above it. Moreover, the RSI on this pair is also overbought at 83, suggesting the rally may be overextended in the short term. The next significant resistance lies around 3,100 SAT, a zone that acted as a major distribution region during XRP’s last bullish leg. If XRP/BTC can consolidate above the 2,400 SAT level, the buyers will likely aim for this zone in the next impulse.

2025-07-16T13:29:32,"Standard Chartered: Bankers Prefer Stablecoins Over Bitcoin","Experts predict that the capitalization of stablecoins could grow to $750 billion by the end of 2026 . In the U.S., key cryptocurrency regulation proposals are under consideration, while major banks are increasingly exploring stablecoin solutions under pressure from fintech rivals. Clients of the American division of Standard Chartered Bank are showing more interest in stablecoins than in Bitcoin. This was stated by Jeffrey Kendrick , Head of Digital Asset Research at the bank, according to The Block . According to the bank, around 90% of recent client discussions were focused on stablecoins. Last week, meetings were held in Washington, D.C., New York, and Boston with clients and regulators. Participants discussed the potential economic impact of stablecoins, anticipating growth in the market to $750 billion . As of now, the segment is valued at about $263 billion , according to CoinGecko . Kendrick believes the $750 billion projection could be reached by the end of 2026. At that point, stablecoins may begin to influence traditional financial markets and monetary policy. In particular, a larger issuance of U.S. Treasury bills may be required to back stablecoins, which could alter the structure of national debt and affect the global demand for the U.S. dollar, he emphasized. Regulatory Momentum Builds The discussions coincided with the U.S. government's active review of legislation to regulate the industry—most notably the GENIUS Act , focused on stablecoins. On July 15 , the U.S. House of Representatives rejected three cryptocurrency-related bills. However, following news of President Donald Trump's Oval Office meeting with House members, a new vote schedule was proposed. Consideration of the bills is now set to begin on July 16 . According to Kendrick, once legislation like the GENIUS Act is passed in developed countries, stablecoins will likely enter widespread use for payments. Corporations will benefit from faster and cheaper transactions, while banks and municipalities could begin issuing their own digital assets. He also noted that in developing countries, consumers often purchase stablecoins to save in dollars—offering protection from the devaluation of local currencies. However, Kendrick warned that a large outflow of funds via stablecoins could create challenges for some economies, making it more difficult to manage exchange rates and preserve banking system stability. Tokenization & the CLARITY Act Kendrick also discussed the CLARITY Act , which he believes could serve as a regulatory blueprint for digital assets and commodities. One of its key impacts, he said, would be on the RWA (Real World Asset) market . The legislation aims to set a framework for the tokenization of assets ranging from real estate to stocks, which would expand the use of DeFi protocols like Aave , he added. Fintech Pressure and JPMorgan's Move JPMorgan , the largest bank in the U.S., is currently exploring publicly traded, dollar-pegged stablecoins , according to CNBC . Despite previous skepticism, CEO Jamie Dimon acknowledged the shift in view: “I don’t understand why they are needed in place of normal payments. But we are obliged to investigate it.” Dimon explained that the move comes amid increased competition from fintech firms: “They are smart, they want to build bank accounts and payment systems. We can’t miss that.” JPMorgan is currently testing its JPMD stablecoin on the Base blockchain , a network supported by U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase . Designed to facilitate settlements among institutional clients, the coin may become a key piece in JPMorgan’s emerging blockchain infrastructure.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9964/standard-chartered-bankers-prefer-stablecoins-over-bitcoin,"REGULATION|BTC|FIAT|EXCHANGE|MARKET","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

The Ethereum price has been a subject of intense speculation, and several factors suggest it could indeed be on the cusp of significant movement. Ethereum, as the backbone of much of the decentralized web, benefits from a confluence of technological advancements, growing adoption, and shifting institutional sentiment. Dencun Upgrade Impact: The recent Dencun upgrade, particularly the implementation of EIP-4844 (Proto-Danksharding), has significantly reduced transaction costs on Layer 2 networks built on Ethereum. This improvement is crucial for scaling the network, making DeFi applications and NFT transactions more affordable and accessible for a wider user base. Lower fees typically translate to higher usage, which can positively impact demand for ETH. Staking Yields and Deflationary Pressure: Post-Merge, Ethereum transitioned to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. The act of staking ETH removes it from circulation, reducing sell pressure. Furthermore, the EIP-1559 upgrade introduced a fee-burning mechanism, making ETH a deflationary asset under certain network conditions. As network activity increases, more ETH is burned, potentially increasing its scarcity and value. Institutional Interest: The success of spot Bitcoin ETFs has paved the way for similar products for Ethereum. Discussions around spot Ethereum ETFs are gaining traction, with major financial institutions exploring their launch. Approval of such products would open the floodgates for traditional finance capital to flow into ETH, providing a massive liquidity injection and legitimizing the asset further. Macroeconomic Tailwinds: A broader shift in global macroeconomic conditions, such as potential interest rate cuts and increased liquidity, could favor risk assets like cryptocurrencies. As traditional investments yield less, investors often seek higher returns in nascent markets, positioning Ethereum as a prime candidate. These combined forces create a powerful narrative for the potential appreciation of the Ethereum price , making Hayes’ call particularly timely. What Does ‘ ETH Season ‘ Truly Mean for You? The term ‘altcoin season’ or, more specifically, ‘ ETH season ‘ refers to a period where alternative cryptocurrencies, led by Ethereum, outperform Bitcoin. Historically, after Bitcoin experiences a significant rally, capital often flows into large-cap altcoins like ETH, followed by smaller-cap altcoins. Arthur Hayes’ declaration suggests we are entering, or are already in, the phase where Ethereum takes the lead. For investors, ‘ ETH season ‘ implies several key dynamics: Capital Rotation: Money that flowed into Bitcoin during its primary rally begins to rotate into Ethereum, seeking higher potential returns. Increased Network Activity: A rising Ethereum price typically coincides with heightened activity across its ecosystem – more transactions, more users engaging with DeFi protocols, and a more vibrant NFT market. Dominance Shift: Ethereum’s market dominance relative to Bitcoin often increases during this period, signaling its growing influence in the overall crypto landscape. Developer Enthusiasm: A bullish ETH market often fuels innovation, attracting more developers to build on the Ethereum blockchain, further strengthening its utility and ecosystem. Hayes’ influence stems from his deep understanding of market mechanics and his history of making prescient calls. When a figure of his stature declares ‘ ETH season ,’ it acts as a powerful signal, influencing market sentiment and potentially accelerating the very trend he predicts. It’s a psychological trigger that encourages market participants to re-evaluate their portfolios and consider increasing their exposure to Ethereum and its associated assets. Navigating the Next Wave of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Innovation At the heart of the Ethereum ecosystem lies Decentralized Finance (DeFi) , a revolutionary paradigm that aims to recreate traditional financial services using blockchain technology. If ‘ETH season’ truly unfolds, DeFi protocols are set to be major beneficiaries. Renewed interest in Ethereum often translates directly into increased Total Value Locked (TVL) and transaction volumes within DeFi. The landscape of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is constantly evolving, with new innovations emerging regularly. Here are some key areas to watch: Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) & Restaking: Protocols like Lido, Rocket Pool, and EigenLayer allow users to stake their ETH while retaining liquidity, enabling them to participate in other DeFi activities. Restaking, a newer concept, allows staked ETH to be used to secure other networks and protocols, potentially earning additional yield. Layer 2 Scaling Solutions: Optimism, Arbitrum, zkSync, and StarkNet are vital for DeFi’s scalability. With Dencun’s proto-danksharding, these Layer 2s become even more efficient, making DeFi transactions faster and cheaper, thereby attracting more users and applications. Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs): Uniswap, Curve, and Balancer remain central to DeFi, facilitating token swaps and liquidity provision. Increased trading volume during ‘ETH season’ directly benefits these platforms. Lending and Borrowing Protocols: Aave and Compound continue to be foundational. As more capital enters DeFi, the demand for lending and borrowing services will likely surge. Understanding these sectors is key to identifying potential opportunities within the broader Decentralized Finance (DeFi) space. Here’s a quick look at how different DeFi categories might perform: DeFi Category Description Potential Impact of ETH Season Liquid Staking Enables staked ETH to remain liquid (e.g., Lido’s stETH) Increased TVL as more ETH is staked; higher yields. Restaking Re-purposing staked ETH for securing other protocols Emerging sector, potentially high yields and innovation. Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) Peer-to-peer token trading (e.g., Uniswap) Higher trading volumes, increased fee generation. Lending/Borrowing Collateralized loans without intermediaries (e.g., Aave) Increased borrowing demand for leverage or liquidity. Layer 2 Solutions Scaling networks built on Ethereum (e.g., Arbitrum, Optimism) Higher user adoption due to lower fees and faster transactions. Is the NFT Market Primed for a Resurgence? Arthur Hayes’ profile picture change to a CryptoPunk wasn’t just a personal preference; it was a symbolic gesture that reverberated through the NFT market . Historically, the health of the NFT space has been closely tied to the performance of Ethereum. A rising ETH price often leads to increased liquidity and renewed interest in digital collectibles, as the underlying asset for most NFTs gains value. The NFT market experienced a boom in 2021-2022, followed by a significant cooldown. However, signs of revival have been emerging, and an ‘ETH season’ could provide the necessary catalyst for a more widespread resurgence. Key aspects to consider: Blue-Chip NFTs: Collections like CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), and Art Blocks are often the first to see renewed interest. These are considered the ‘digital art’ equivalents of traditional fine art and act as bellwethers for the broader market. Gaming & Metaverse NFTs: The intersection of NFTs with gaming (GameFi) and virtual worlds (Metaverse) continues to be a growth area. As these platforms mature and attract more users, the utility and demand for in-game NFTs and virtual land could increase. New Use Cases: Beyond profile pictures and art, NFTs are finding applications in ticketing, digital identities, intellectual property rights, and supply chain management. These real-world use cases could drive sustainable growth. Challenges remain, including market saturation and regulatory uncertainty. However, if the broader crypto market enters an ‘explosive’ bullish phase led by Ethereum, the NFT market is likely to follow suit, offering opportunities for collectors and investors alike.

Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): While influential figures provide valuable insights, always conduct your own thorough research. Understand the projects, their fundamentals, and their long-term viability. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. While Ethereum may lead, consider diversifying across different Layer 2s, promising DeFi protocols, and select NFT projects that align with your risk tolerance. Understand Gas Fees: During periods of high network activity, Ethereum gas fees can surge. Familiarize yourself with Layer 2 solutions and their lower fees to make transactions more economical. Risk Management is Key: Crypto markets are inherently volatile. Invest only what you can afford to lose. Consider setting stop-loss orders and having a clear exit strategy for taking profits. Stay Informed: Follow reliable crypto news sources, market analysts, and key opinion leaders. The market moves fast, and staying updated is crucial. This ‘Explosive’ period could offer significant opportunities, but it also comes with increased risks. Prudent decision-making and a well-thought-out strategy are essential. Conclusion: Is Ethereum Poised for an Unprecedented Run? Arthur Hayes’ declaration that ‘Ethereum season’ has begun is more than just a casual tweet; it’s a significant signal from a respected market veteran. Backed by technological advancements like the Dencun upgrade, growing institutional interest, and a robust ecosystem of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and a re-emerging NFT market, Ethereum appears to be in a strong position.

2025-07-16T13:19:57,"Crypto Price Analysis 7-16: BITCOIN: BTC, ETHEREUM: ETH, SOLANA: SOL, ARBITRUM: ARB, FILECOIN: FIL, JUPITER: JUP","The crypto market has recovered after Tuesday’s decline as Bitcoin (BTC) tests key support levels. As a result, the overall market cap has risen 1.34% to $3.71 trillion. The flagship cryptocurrency fell nearly 2% on Tuesday, settling at $117,682 after dropping to an intraday low of $115,701. The current session sees BTC marginally up, trading around $117,868. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) has made a strong recovery after Tuesday’s correction. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is up nearly 6% and has reclaimed $3,000, trading around $3,137. Ripple (XRP) is up 1.54%, trading around $2.92, while Solana (SOL) is up nearly 2%, trading around $163. Dogecoin (DOGE) is up over 3%, while Cardano (ADA) is up 2.50%, trading around $0.743. Stellar (XLM) , Chainlink (LINK) , Hedera (HBAR) , Toncoin (TON) , Litecoin (LTC) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable increases. Dow Jones Plunges On CPI Data US stocks had a mixed day, coinciding with an increase in a key inflation metric. The Dow Jones registered a drop of over 300 points (0.72%) while the S&P 500 fell 0.13%. On the other hand, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 100 points or 0.53%, thanks to Nvidia’s robust performance. Markets remained focused on the latest escalation in US tariffs, while June consumer price index (CPI) numbers showed the first signs of tariff-induced inflation. June CPI rose 2.7% on an annual basis and 0.3% month over month, indicating rising inflation, likely due to tariffs on major trading partners. However, the latest round of tariffs did not trigger the type of reactions seen in April, due to skepticism that President Trump would follow through with the tariffs. Key Crypto Bills Stall Key crypto bills backed by President Trump stalled in the US House of Representatives after failing to clear a key procedural step. Trump had urged Republican lawmakers to “get the first vote done” on legislation regulating payment stablecoins as part of a larger effort to pass crypto legislation before the August recess. The President took to Truth Social to order Republicans to vote ""yes"" on the GENIUS Act, designed to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins. Democratic lawmakers have attempted to counter the “Crypto Week” narrative by launching their own event, called Crypto Corruption Awareness Week. Representatives Maxine Waters, Stephen Lynch, and others are attempting to push for clauses that would bar sitting Presidents from participating in or profiting from crypto businesses. However, President Donald Trump claimed he has convinced most Republican lawmakers who did not support the bill to vote in favor when the House convenes on Wednesday. Trump said he met with 11 of the 12 Republican representatives and convinced them to vote in favor of the legislation. “I am in the Oval Office with 11 of the 12 Congressmen/women necessary to pass the GENIUS Act, and, after a short discussion, they have all agreed to vote tomorrow morning in favor of the Rule.” Republicans wanted the GENIUS Act to be bundled in with the other two crypto bills up for a vote later this week, the Anti-CBDC Surveillance Act and the CLARITY Act. House Speaker Mike Johnson took to X to thank President Trump for stepping in, stating, “I’m thankful for President Trump getting involved tonight to ensure that we can pass the GENIUS Act tomorrow, and agreeing again to help us advance additional crypto legislation in the coming days.” Ripple To Pursue MiCA License Ripple has confirmed plans to apply for a MiCA license to expand its crypto and stablecoin offerings across the European Union (EU). A spokesperson for the company stated that Ripple plans to become MiCA-compliant, recognizing the “significant opportunities in Europe.” The development comes after Ripple completed the registration of Ripple Payments Europe SA in Luxembourg in Late April. According to reports, Ripple applied for an electronic money institution license in Luxembourg. However, the company is yet to comment on or confirm the reports. Kraken Launches Regulated Crypto Derivatives Trading Feature Kraken is offering a new derivatives feature that integrates the exchange’s Kraken Pro platform, which gives users access to cryptocurrency futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Kraken noted in a press release, “With this launch, Kraken clients in the US can now trade futures alongside one of the world’s most liquid cryptocurrency spot markets. It’s a meaningful step in giving traders broad market access and increased capital efficiency within a regulated and high-performance environment.” The feature allows Kraken Derivatives US customers to access instant funding and enables seamless transfer of assets used as collateral. It will also provide customers with a unified interface that they can tap into as they explore advanced trading strategies. Kraken is also planning to expand support to include commodities, fixed income, foreign exchange, and equity futures. “Kraken Derivatives US further enriches our unified trading experience, where digital and traditional assets can be accessed side by side without compromising on features, performance, or liquidity.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has registered a marginal recovery during the ongoing session after testing a key support level on Tuesday. The flagship cryptocurrency ended the weekend in positive territory, rising nearly 2% to settle at $118,624. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as BTC raced past $123,000 to an all-time high of $123,091 before losing momentum and settling at $119,714. Selling pressure returned on Tuesday as traders began locking in their profits. As a result, the price plunged to an intraday low of $115,701 before settling at $117,682, ultimately registering a drop of nearly 2%. Despite Tuesday’s decline, analysts believe BTC won't enter a downward trend anytime soon, with on-chain data supporting a continuation of its bullish trajectory. 21Shares crypto research strategist Matt Mena stated, “The structural imbalance between surging demand and a rapidly vanishing supply base makes a prolonged correction increasingly unlikely. There are far more positives than negatives right now.” Mena also pointed out that BTC supply on crypto exchanges and over-the-counter (OTC) desks remained at an all-time low, while the price of the asset soared. “On the supply side, the fundamentals remain even more skewed.” However, he stressed that macro risks could jeopardize the uptrend, and that a reversal could not be completely ruled out. “It is certainly possible that Bitcoin consolidates, or even sees a pullback. If Trump’s proposed tariffs end up being more severe than markets currently anticipate, or if Powell signals that rate cuts are further off than expected, we could see risk assets broadly reprice lower, including Bitcoin.” He predicted the uptrend would resume once summer liquidity returned. “Once summer ends and liquidity returns, we expect upside momentum to resume. What’s truly remarkable is that Bitcoin is setting new all-time highs during the most illiquid, seasonally weak part of the year.” BTC crossed $110,000 on Thursday (July 3) but lost momentum after reaching this level and fell 1.41% to $108,097 on Friday. The price recovered over the weekend, rising 0.19% on Saturday and nearly 1% on Sunday to settle at $109,231.

The cryptocurrency, which had been trading near record territory, dipped to $118,593, as the global market absorbed the implications of heightened geopolitical risk in the Middle East. Bitcoin price slides on latest news in Middle East. Source: CoinMarketCap The airstrike, broadcast live on Al Jazeera , targeted the Syrian Ministry of Defense. Footage captured massive explosions near central Damascus, with reports confirming the assassination of three senior Syrian military officials. Huge explosions were seen in Damascus as Israel bombed Syria’s defence ministry during a live Al Jazeera broadcast nearby. pic.twitter.com/Fe7N6xH02I — Al Jazeera English (@AJEnglish) July 16, 2025 The move marks a major escalation in Israel’s southern campaign, deepening regional instability at a time when global markets are already on edge from ongoing tariff wars and political volatility. Bitcoin’s 24-hour trading volume stood at $78.34 billion, a significant drop of 47.41%, suggesting reduced conviction among bulls following the geopolitical shock. Despite the decline, BTC retains a market cap of $2.35 trillion and remains just below all-time highs. However, the sharp price reaction underscores Bitcoin’s evolving role not only as a store of value, but also as a risk-sensitive asset tied to global headlines. Historically, Bitcoin has been viewed as a geopolitical hedge during periods of currency debasement or financial repression. But as institutional inflows grow and broader macro linkages deepen, sudden geopolitical escalations, especially in energy-sensitive regions can lead to mixed responses. Market watchers are now closely monitoring whether this latest pullback is a temporary reaction to war-related headlines or the start of a broader consolidation phase. With Bitcoin still up more than 90% year-to-date, some degree of cooling would not be unexpected. Key technical levels to watch include support around $116,500 and deeper demand zones near $114,000, which coincide with the late June breakout range.

A rating of organizations by ether holdings on their balance sheets shows that PulseChain and BitMine Immersion Technologies occupy third and fourth places, with Ethereum reserves valued at $522 million and $512 million , respectively. Between July 7 and July 13 , SharpLink purchased 74,656 ETH for a total of $213 million , at an average price of $2,852 . “The current balance is approximately 280,706 ETH . Around 99.7% of these coins are staked or restaked. Since June 2, income generated from these activities has been about 415 ETH ,” company representatives stated. The total volume of Ethereum reserves held by corporations globally is estimated at 1.6 million ETH (~$5 billion) . By comparison, Ethereum-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) collectively hold 4.56 million ETH (~$14.33 billion) . Is Ethereum Back in Fashion? Over the past 24 hours, Ethereum , the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has grown by 6.3% . At the time of writing, the weighted average price of ETH is $3,161 , a level last seen in early February. By comparison, Bitcoin has risen by only 1.2% in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $58,214 . (Note: Earlier figure of $118,214 corrected for accuracy.) “After two years of underperformance, ETH is once again gaining attention,” said Greg Magadini , Director of Derivatives at Amberdata , in an interview with Decrypt . Over the past two years, Bitcoin has appreciated nearly 300% , while Ethereum has increased by a relatively modest 60% . Since the beginning of the year, ETH is down approximately 8% . Magadini noted that open interest in Ethereum futures has reached a 12-month high , comparable to levels seen when ETH was trading around $4,000 in December 2024. According to him, this signals an influx of capital and renewed activity among market participants. The Unlucky Whale According to analytics platform Lookonchain , a major investor (wallet address: 0x2258) opened a short position on Ethereum with 18x leverage on July 15 . The trader's unrealized loss currently exceeds $3.5 million . Researchers note that the position faces liquidation if ETH falls below $3,321.81 . Peter Thiel Invests in Ethereum Infrastructure Peter Thiel , co-founder of PayPal, and his investment firm Founders Fund , recently acquired a 9.1% stake in BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) , according to a 13G filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Tuesday. The document indicates that Thiel-linked entities bought 5,094,000 BMNR shares through several legal structures. Other participants in the June funding round included Pantera Capital , Galaxy Digital , and Kraken . BitMine has also appointed Tom Lee , co-founder of Fundstrat and well-known for his Bitcoin market predictions, as its Chairman of the Board . In total, more than 55 million shares were privately placed at a price of $4.50 per share , with proceeds intended to replenish Ethereum reserves . BitMine operates as a digital asset mining and management company. Since June, it has been led by Tom Lee , who also serves as Chief Investment Officer at Fundstrat . Following the launch of its Ethereum strategy, BitMine shares have experienced high volatility , with closing prices ranging from $4.26 to as high as $135 . On July 14 , BMNR shares surged to $59 , a 45% increase from the previous Friday's close of $40.62 . However, by the end of the session, prices fell to $41.02 , ending the day with a modest 1% gain . Ethereum: Complex, but Promising Bitcoin remains the dominant asset held in corporate crypto treasuries. According to Bitcoin Treasuries , public companies currently hold around 863,298 BTC , valued at over $102 billion . However, Ethereum's sophistication and utility continue to attract corporate attention. “Ethereum’s flexibility makes it more attractive—but also more complex to use,” said Ryan Chou , co-founder of BTCFi project Solv Protocol . He describes Ethereum as “digital oil”—a universal asset fueling much of on-chain finance: staking, transaction gas, collateral, and settlements. These concepts, however, are harder to explain to mainstream markets compared to Bitcoin’s simple “store of value” narrative. “Ethereum still has significant potential as a tool for both participation and savings . Forward-thinking corporate treasuries are beginning to understand this,” Chou added. In his view, Ethereum is poised to become a key component of institutional on-chain infrastructure . “As we enter a new wave of mass adoption, assets with real-world utility , not just storage value, will become far more important,” he concluded.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9962/sharp-link-surpasses-ethereum-foundation-in-eth-holdings,"ETH|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX","News|Ethereum",cryptocompare
