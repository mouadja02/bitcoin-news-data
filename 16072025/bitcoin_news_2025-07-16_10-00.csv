2025-07-16T07:30:02,"Vanguard Becomes Largest Institutional Shareholder of MicroStrategy","Vanguard, one of the world’s leading investment firms, has quietly become the largest institutional shareholder of Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy (MSTR), a company widely recognized for using Bitcoin as its main treasury reserve asset. According to data from investment research platform Intel, Vanguard now holds over 20 million shares of MicroStrategy, amounting to around 8% of the company’s outstanding Class A common stock. This significant stake indirectly exposes Vanguard to the more than 200,000 Bitcoin that MicroStrategy keeps on its balance sheet, marking a 26.3% increase in holdings from January to April 2025. This exposure largely comes through Vanguard’s various index and mutual funds, including the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund, which includes MicroStrategy in its broad U.S. equity allocation. Additionally, MicroStrategy is part of multiple Vanguard mutual funds and ETFs tracking mid-cap benchmarks. Vanguard: Reluctant on Bitcoin Despite its growing indirect exposure to Bitcoin through MicroStrategy, Vanguard has maintained its cautious stance on cryptocurrency. The firm has consistently warned clients about the volatility of digital assets and has declined to offer spot Bitcoin ETFs , unlike competitors such as BlackRock. In a Bloomberg TV interview in May, Vanguard CEO Salim Ramji made it clear that the company would not change its approach to cryptocurrencies, stating, “We don’t get caught up in the latest fad, but we’re dependable for the long term.” In another interview with ETF.com, Ramji emphasized that Vanguard is not interested in “making bets on speculative assets like Bitcoin,” highlighting that such moves are inconsistent with the investment philosophy Vanguard has built over five decades. A Byproduct of Passive Investing Vanguard’s unexpected exposure to Bitcoin through its stake in MicroStrategy has brought attention to the realities of passive investing. As Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted, passive index funds require holding all stocks within the index, regardless of the company’s focus or the manager’s personal views on certain assets. Balchunas remarked that Vanguard’s significant exposure to a company deeply tied to Bitcoin highlights how index investing can lead to unintended exposure, adding humorously that this situation proves “God has a sense of humor.” The post Vanguard Becomes Largest Institutional Shareholder of MicroStrategy appeared first on TheCoinrise.com .",thecoinrise,https://thecoinrise.com/vanguard-becomes-largest-institutional-shareholder-of-microstrategy/,"BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION","Finance and Business News|Vanguard crypto|Vanguard MSTR Holdings",cryptocompare

And is expected to set the stage for a potential breakout toward the next big target at $0.85. This technical move comes amid improving altcoin sector’s strength, with capital rotating out of Bitcoin as the altcoin season index climbed 9.4%. What has favored Cardano’s buzz is that Emurgo unveiled the Cardano Card on July 15. This development allows users to spend ADA globally, earn DeFi-based rewards, and allocate a portion of profits to the Cardano treasury, enhancing the ecosystem’s sustainability. While the network has developments fueling its long-term run, wondering when will Cardano go up? Join me as I decode the Cardano analysis for the short term. ADA Network Activity on the Move? Cardano’s rally is supported by surging on-chain activity. According to Santiment data, active ADA addresses have climbed to 38.5k, marking a streak of a 10-day uptrend.

2025-07-16T07:15:07,"Prominent Analyst Katie Stockton Commented on Bitcoin and XRP Price","While Bitcoin's recent record high of over $123,000 has created great excitement in the cryptocurrency markets, Fairlead Strategies founder Katie Stockton predicts that the price could rise to $135,000 in the intermediate term. Appearing on CNBC's “Closing Bell” program, Stockton stated that Bitcoin has emerged strongly from the consolidation process in recent weeks and that this rise may continue, according to technical analysis data. Stockton said that this rise, which came after a pause of approximately seven to eight weeks, indicates the market is regaining strength. The expert, who uses a “measured movement projection” method, particularly after the strong breakout of the $108,300 resistance level, stated that this trend could continue to $135,000. According to Stockton, this level stands out as a “quarterly” target before a corrective phase begins. Related News: JUST IN: Three Major Cryptocurrency Bills Expected to Be Legislated in the USA Stalled: Voting Negative - Here are the Details Technical analysis wasn't limited to Bitcoin. Stockton noted that Ethereum also broke above its 200-day moving average, signaling a positive signal, while Ripple broke out of its triangle formation and moved upward. He stated that this situation presents a positive technical outlook for the cryptocurrency market as a whole. Crypto-related stocks are also experiencing this upward trend. Coinbase shares broke through the upper limit of its long-term “cup and handle” formation, while MicroStrategy shares experienced a short-term breakout. Stockton noted that MicroStrategy, in particular, maintained its long-term upward trend despite its volatile nature and is showing a recent surge. But there are caveats. Stockton noted that the crypto market can occasionally experience vertical price movements, followed by prolonged periods of sideways movement that force investors to wait patiently. *This is not investment advice.

A recent post by crypto analyst JD (@jaydee_757) serves as a reminder that not every dramatic price spike, especially those caused by technical “glitches,” can be taken at face value. He shared a chart analysis of XRP/BTC on the weekly timeframe, presenting a sharp rebuttal to inflated predictions, particularly those suggesting XRP could reach $10,000. According to JD, glitches that momentarily display such values are meaningless and should not be treated as valid price action. $XRP – Awaiting MACD Cross on the weekly for confirmation.

These anomalies, while occasionally cited by enthusiasts as signs of future valuation, do not reflect actual market dynamics. In recent years, some XRP supporters have circulated screenshots showing the token briefly displaying values in the thousands and millions . However, these are often due to API errors or data feed bugs on certain trading platforms. While these visuals generate interest and sometimes hope, they do not represent actual liquidity or executed trades. Other experts have criticized those who share false and unrealistic predictions , and glitches contribute to this problem.

The focus is on three main indicators: Stochastic RSI, RSI, and MACD. Each of these tools is demonstrating a shift in momentum, but confirmation is still pending. The latest weekly candle shows a notable shift in momentum, which JD highlights as a potentially significant signal. Although this move does not guarantee reversal, XRP briefly breached the $3 resistance, and other analysts have predicted that the asset’s next stop could range from $10 to $20 . XRP: Technical Indicators Show Progress The Stochastic RSI has broken above the 20 level, an early sign of a possible upward trend forming. RSI has moved above its moving average, a development JD notes as a positive shift. The MACD, however, has not yet completed a bullish crossover. The chart also revisits the last time these indicators aligned back in late 2024. The previous alignment led to a substantial rally in XRP/BTC, and a similar structure is now forming. Until the MACD confirms the momentum with a crossover above the signal line, the setup remains incomplete. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

In a new CNBC interview, Citi equity strategist Scott Chronert highlights that markets tend to be forward-looking and investors are now positioning for a potential pick-up in earnings growth next year. “I actually think [the market] is increasingly focused on the follow-through and the aftermath of tariffs and other policy news in terms of what it means for 2026. As we go into the back half of the year, usually [we] flip forward in the calendar, and right now when you’re looking at the way the consensus earnings expectations are set up – it’s for pretty decent acceleration next year. I think that’s where a lot of the market’s focus is beginning to shift.” Chronert says Citi maintains a long-term bullish stance on the stock market, viewing pullbacks as golden opportunities. “Expectations for the next five-year earnings growth are as high as we’ve seen. So there’s a lot of burden on beats and raises, particularly out of this growth part of the market, and that’s where we get a little bit unnerved. Our view for this second half is that you’re setting this thing up for volatility dynamics to come into play. You get triggers for pullbacks.

As it breaks out of a triangle formation, some analysts suggest that a rally to a new all-time high (ATH) could be around the corner. Related Reading: Top Crypto Exchanges Made $172 Million From TRUMP Memecoin Listing – Report SUI Breaks Out Of Multi-Month Pattern On Tuesday, SUI broke above the $4.00 resistance for the first time since May, hitting a two-month high of $4.10. The altcoin has seen an 81% surge over the past three weeks, recovering from the June retracement and setting up for a rally continuation. Notably, SUI ended its multi-month downtrend at the end of March, breaking above its descending resistance and jumping to its $4.29 high in May. Following the Q2 breakout, the cryptocurrency has been trading within the $2.33-$4.10 range. However, last month’s market pullback sent the token from its key $3.00 mid-range support to its three-month low of $2.22 before the recent recovery. Since then, SUI has reclaimed the mid-range area and skyrocketed toward the range high as Bitcoin’s (BTC) ATH rally leads the market. Over the past 24 hours, SUI has soared nearly 15% from the $3.50 support toward the $4.00 resistance, breaking out of a triangle formation and potentially setting the stage for a massive breakout. Analyst Ali Martinez affirmed that the altcoin’s bullish price action could push its price to a new ATH as it has broken out of a multi-month symmetrical triangle pattern over the past few days and attempts to turn the next key level into support. According to the market watcher, SUI finally broke above the descending resistance after reclaiming the $3.50 area on Monday and could target a 140% move to the $7.60 area if there’s a spike in buying pressure. Similarly, analyst Nebraskangooner highlighted that reclaiming the $4.00 resistance will propel the cryptocurrency to a new ATH. This level has been a crucial support since the Q3 2024 rally and a key resistance area after the early 2025 pullbacks. Is A Double-Digit Rally Coming? Crypto Bullet noted that SUI has entered its Wave 3, which eyes a double-digit target for the cryptocurrency. The analyst previously explained that the altcoin had a “clear 1-5 impulse off the April’s low – higher degree Wave (1),” before entering the corrective Wave 2 between late May and Early June. However, “Wave 2 took longer and went deeper than expected (obviously due to the situation in the Middle East).” After the recent breakout, SUI has entered the long-awaited Wave 3, with a 51% increase so far, and a target above the $10 mark, the analyst detailed. Additionally, he pointed to SUI’s trading pair against Solana (SOL), as the weekly chart “Looks like a breakout is imminent.” The altcoin is currently retesting a crucial resistance level against SOL, which could lead to a breakout to the 0.0470 area. “In the coming weeks, SUI will just crush Solana,” Crypto Bullet forecasted. Related Reading: Unraveling The Bitcoin Boom: Experts Decode Record $123,000 Surge Meanwhile, Crypto Kaleo affirmed that the cryptocurrency has continued its bounce on its trading pair against BTC. At the start of the month, the analyst highlighted that SUI had bounced from its BTC and USD pairs, becoming one of the leading altcoins. “BTC ratio chart looks ready to rip out of the wedge it’s been accumulating in since the beginning of 2025. Up only,” he concluded. As of this writing, SUI is trading at $3.96, a 3% increase in the daily timeframe.

The recent unauthorized withdrawal is the most significant attack against BigOne to date. The exchange is ranked at position #91 based on the CoinGecko reliability index, with a trust score of 6/10. The exchange has relatively high volumes, but limited liquidity for some of its trading pairs, with significant slippage potential. The exchange is not among the Tier 1 markets that carry the most traffic. On-chain investigator ZachXBT noted the market has been widely used to launder funds from personal scams. BigOne noted outflows from its main hot wallet The BigOne exchange team immediately identified the suspicious outflows, affecting its main hot wallet. The wallet’s keys are unaffected and the exchange is working toward renewing deposits and withdrawals. The exchange still posted a system upgrade message hours after the exploit. ⚠️ Security Incident: unauthorized access to our hot wallet All user assets are safe. BigONE will fully bear all the losses. Trading and deposits will resume soon; withdrawals after added security upgrades. 🔗 https://t.co/CWCrng2KK8 — BigONE (@BigONEexchange) July 16, 2025 The exchange’s biggest hot wallet , holding over $23M, was last active in the past few hours. The recent outflows affected a series of hot wallets on different chains, including 120 BTC . The hacker holds nearly $4M in ETH and several tokens, though the tokens may not be easily tradable. The hacker also took stablecoins on several networks, as well as SHIB, DOGE, and smaller Ethereum-based tokens. Another $7M is held in TRX tokens on the TRON network. User balances have not been materially affected, and BigOne will use its insurance fund to cover the loss. The exchange currently holds over $91M in crypto assets, based on DeFiLlama data. BigOne mostly trades BTC, ETH, and SOL, with significant markets for LTC and older meme tokens like BONK and DOGE. The exchange was founded in 2017, going through several bull and bear markets already. The market operator started out in mainland China, but later moved due to regulatory restrictions on crypto trading. The long-term presence on the market meant BigOne mostly carried altcoins from previous bull cycles, with few inflows from the latest meme tokens. BigOne renews centralized exchange attacks The BigOne exchange attack follows a series of exploits against decentralized protocols. During the week, the GMX protocol saw an outflow of multiple tokens valued at $42M, before the hacker agreed to return the funds. A classic supply chain attack, causing unauthorized withdrawals, is now a more rare event. Centralized exchanges have not suffered such attacks since KuCoin’s exploit for $275M in 2020. Even the Bybit attack used a wallet vulnerability, instead of the exchange’s account and authorization infrastructure. The recent exploit showed that server vulnerabilities can also be exploited, changing the logic to operate hot wallets. The hackers managed to bypass the account and withdrawal controls, though the outsized transactions were still flagged.

2025-07-16T06:58:43,"Postgres Revolution: How ParadeDB Unleashes Unprecedented Data Search Amidst the AI Applications Boom","BitcoinWorld Postgres Revolution: How ParadeDB Unleashes Unprecedented Data Search Amidst the AI Applications Boom In the fast-paced world of technology, where artificial intelligence is reshaping industries and demanding unprecedented data capabilities, the underlying infrastructure often determines success. For those deeply invested in the crypto space, understanding robust data solutions is key to navigating volatile markets and complex analytics. This is where an unexpected hero emerges: Postgres , an open-source database management system nearly four decades old, is experiencing an explosive resurgence, driven by its surprising suitability for modern AI Applications . But as demand surges, a critical challenge remains: efficient data search and analytics. Enter ParadeDB, a groundbreaking solution poised to transform how we interact with vast datasets, directly challenging established players like Elasticsearch. Why is Postgres Becoming the Database of Choice for AI Applications ? For decades, Postgres has been a reliable workhorse in the database world, known for its stability, extensibility, and adherence to SQL standards. Its open-source nature fosters a vibrant community and continuous innovation. However, its recent surge in popularity is directly tied to the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence. AI models thrive on structured, reliable data, and Postgres offers a robust foundation for managing this information. Its ability to handle complex queries, support various data types, and integrate with a wide array of tools makes it an ideal backend for many AI-driven systems. As Bitcoin World has reported, industry giants are recognizing this trend, with significant acquisitions like Crunchy Data by Snowflake and Neon by Databricks underscoring Postgres’s strategic importance in the evolving data landscape. How is ParadeDB Revolutionizing Data Search and Analytics? Despite Postgres ‘s undeniable strengths, a significant gap has persisted: native, high-performance full-text search and analytics capabilities. Traditionally, organizations would resort to moving their valuable data to separate systems, such as Elasticsearch, to perform these critical functions. This introduces complexity, latency, and increased costs. ParadeDB is changing this paradigm entirely. As an innovative open-source extension, ParadeDB allows users to perform sophisticated Data Search and analytics directly within their existing Postgres databases. This eliminates the need for cumbersome data transfers, ensuring that data remains secure, consistent, and immediately accessible. ParadeDB seamlessly integrates with popular cloud Postgres offerings like Google Cloud SQL, Azure Postgres, and Amazon RDS, making it accessible to a wide range of enterprises. The Elasticsearch Challenge: Why a New Approach to Data Management Was Needed? For years, Elasticsearch has been the go-to solution for full-text search and analytics, especially for large datasets. Founded in 2012, it built its reputation on powerful search capabilities. However, its fundamental architecture often involves moving data back and forth between a primary database like Postgres and Elasticsearch itself. Philippe Noël, co-founder and CEO of ParadeDB, highlights the inherent issues with this approach. “That breaks all the time,” Noël told Bitcoin World. “The two databases are not meant to work together. There’s a lot of compatibility issues, there’s a lot of latency issues, higher costs, and all of that deteriorates the user experience.” This constant data synchronization can be a nightmare for heavy workloads or applications requiring real-time updates. ParadeDB’s core innovation lies in addressing these pain points by building directly into Postgres, offering a more integrated and efficient solution for comprehensive Data Management . Riding the AI Applications Boom: ParadeDB’s Growth and Future Vision ParadeDB’s journey began in 2023, with its founders, Philippe Noël and Ming Ying, driven by their own frustrations with Postgres search limitations during their first startup, Whist. Recognizing a widespread problem, they focused on developing a robust open-source product first. This strategy quickly paid off. In early 2024, Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba became ParadeDB’s first enterprise customer, a testament to the platform’s immediate value. This pivotal moment propelled ParadeDB into building out its enterprise software, attracting other prominent clients like Modern Treasury, Bilt Rewards, and TCDI. The company recently secured a significant $12 million Series A funding round, led by Craft Ventures with participation from existing investors including Y Combinator. These funds are earmarked for strategic hiring, expanding their current team of four to at least ten employees, and enhancing the platform’s user interface and analytics capabilities. This rapid growth trajectory underscores the immense demand for better Data Search solutions in the age of advanced AI Applications . Seamless Data Management : Real-World Impact and Integration ParadeDB’s approach to Data Management is rooted in simplicity and efficiency. By functioning as a native extension, it eliminates the operational overhead associated with managing separate search infrastructures. This direct integration means developers can leverage their existing Postgres knowledge and tools, streamlining workflows and reducing development time. The success stories from early adopters like Alibaba, Modern Treasury, Bilt Rewards, and TCDI highlight the tangible benefits: improved performance, reduced costs, and a more unified data experience. As Devin Pratt, a research director at IDC, noted to Bitcoin World, the industry is increasingly consolidating around Postgres, with major acquisitions validating its central role. ParadeDB is strategically positioned to capitalize on this trend, offering a compelling alternative to traditional, separate search solutions. “We think building on Postgres is actually a meaningful shift,’” Noël concluded. “Because that’s where the data is, and you can make a meaningful dent in Elasticsearch ’s market share by meeting users where their data is, rather than building something that’s marginally faster or marginally cheaper.” In conclusion, ParadeDB represents a significant leap forward in database technology, particularly for organizations grappling with the demands of modern AI Applications . By empowering Postgres with native, high-performance Data Search and analytics, it offers a powerful, integrated, and cost-effective solution that challenges the status quo established by legacy systems like Elasticsearch . As the world becomes increasingly data-driven, ParadeDB’s innovative approach to Data Management positions it as a key player in the next generation of enterprise infrastructure.

2025-07-16T06:56:36,"Ether Races 6% Against Bitcoin as GENUIS Act Puts Spotlight on Yield-Bearing Stablecoins: Analyst","Ethereum's native token ether (ETH), is gaining ground against bitcoin (BTC), as the impending GENUIS Act is likely to ban yield-bearing stablecoins that promise interest-like returns, according to Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research. The Binance-listed ether-bitcoin ratio, representing ether's BTC-denominated price, rose over 5.96% to 0.02670 on Tuesday, registering its best performance since May 13, according to data source TradingView. The upswing marked a bullish resolution to the multi-week range play and suggests continued ether outperformance ahead. Ether's dollar-denominated price rose over 4%, topping $3,100 for the first time since February. According to Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, the key driver for ether's price surge is seemingly the growing anticipation that the GENUIS Act, or the U.S. stablecoin bill, will pass, restricting U.S. stablecoin issuers from paying interest. ""That would potentially reinforce Ethereum's importance within the digital asset ecosystem,"" Thielen said in a client note shared with CoinDesk. Thielen added that the GENUIS Act has put the spotlight on Ethena's $5 billion synthetic dollar USDe, which achieves delta-hedging or cash and carry arbitrage by shorting perpetual futures equivalent to the amount of ETH received from users as collateral. That's how it generates yield on USDe. The long-prevailing theory is that the shorting operation adds to bearish pressures in the futures market and caps basis, the gap between futures and spot prices. ""Ethena currently represents about 4% of Ethereum’s $26 billion open interest, and by consistently selling futures, it has exerted downward pressure on ETH prices,"" Thielen said. Ethena has already reached out to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to seek clarity on synthetic dollars, such as the USDe. The team reportedly argued that the synthetic dollar functions as a payment instrument rather than a security and falls outside the scope of the GENUIS Act and the STABLE Act, which regulate payment stablecoin issuers. Ethena is headquartered in Lisbon, Portugal, with new dollar inflows primarily coming from outside the U.S. So, it remains to be seen how it fits the evolving regulatory picture in the U.S. ""If Ethena were to comply with the U.S. stablecoin bill, it could be forced to stop buying Ethereum altogether. However, the market may be interpreting this dynamic differently—ENA-USDT continues to rally, supported by rising Ethereum funding rates,"" Thielen said.

2025-07-16T06:54:07,"Circle Applies to OCC: Reinforcing Control in USDC Reserves","The post Circle Applies to OCC: Reinforcing Control in USDC Reserves appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The stablecoin issuer, Circle Internet Group, applied to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) on June 30 to establish a US trust bank called First National Digital Currency Bank. If OCC approves, the trust bank would oversee the company’s reserves of USDC (its dollar-pegged stablecoin) and offer digital asset custody services to institutional clients. Why Did Circle Apply for National Digital Currency Bank Currently, the BlacRock manages the majority of Circle’s stablecoin reserves, which is not ideal for the company. It makes the stablecoin users susceptible to risks without warranting their safety. Without a strong, trustworthy structure, the company would become vulnerable and would be exposed to legal uncertainties. Additionally, this will result in token collapse and scaling back the adoption rate. So, the company is applying to the National Trust Bank to strengthen its USDC infrastructure. Circle’s Key Objectives with National Digital Currency Bank The National Trust Bank will be managing USDC reserves and tokenized treasuries in Circle while offering on-chain payments under federal oversight. This initiative aims to help Circle meet the requirements in the GENIUS Act. One of Circle’s primary goals is to build an internet financial system that is transparent, efficient, and accessible to all users, ensuring legal compliance. Circle plans to focus on the custody of tokenized assets — stocks and bonds on blockchain rails, rather than cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Amid the global trends of modernizing traditional markets by integrating blockchain technology, Circle is fortifying its blockchain priority to meet the global demand. Has the OCC Application Been Approved? The OCC has not yet approved Circle’s application for a national trust bank charter. The process of reviewing the application includes a public comment period of 30 days before finalizing. Generally, the complete process takes 120 days, examining the necessary documentation, business summary, compliance, requirements of global standards, and outline of the services it aspires to provide. Final Thought With over $62 billion in USDC circulation, Circle is thriving in the global competition of digital assets. The company is actively working to terminate its reliance on a third party to oversee its digital asset reserves while strengthening internal control by minimizing risks and enhancing transparency.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/circle-applies-to-occ-reinforcing-control-in-usdc-reserves/,"USDC|FIAT|BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|BTC","News",cryptocompare

2025-07-16T06:47:53,"Crypto Regulations in Argentina 2025","The post Crypto Regulations in Argentina 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In Argentina, cryptocurrency is treated as a form of digital asset, allowing trading, storage, and usage without major restrictions. To ensure the safe and secure use of crypto, the Argentine federal government has implemented important regulations governing its use, including a VASP license, registration, and strict compliance with AMK and CFT. In 2025, Argentina is actively implementing a regulatory framework for crypto to enhance oversight and align with global standards. Major Crypto Regulations in Argentina 2025 April 14, 2025 – Cepo Cambiario The Argentine government lifted most currency controls, also known as “ cepo cambiario ”, allowing individuals to buy US dollars without restrictions. This deregulation extended to transactions involving cryptocurrency, expanding liberalization of foreign exchange. March 14, 2025- Resolution 1058/2025 The rule was issued by the National Securities Commission (CNV) to establish a mandatory registration system for virtual asset service providers (VASPs). It also seeks to align Argentina with global anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CFT) standards recommended by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The full regulatory framework will take effect on December 31, 2025. The deadline for registration of entities is as follows: Individuals– before July 1, 2025; Legal bodies in Argentina– before August 1, 2025; Foreign legal entities– before September 1, 2025. Timeline of crypto regulations: Date Law/ Regulations Details July 18, 2024 Decree 640/2024 Legal framework for the tokenization of goods March 25, 2024 CNV resolution 994/2024 Mandatory VASP registration with CNV March 25, 2024 UIF Resolution 49/2024 VASPs as UIF reporting entities, AML/CFT obligations March 14, 2024 Law 27,739 VASP registration, AML/CFT, phased compliance deadline December 20, 2023 Decree 70/2023 Legal validity of crypto contracts reaffirmed May 4, 2023 Central bank ban Banks decline to offer crypto services What is the Argentine Government Saying About Crypto? In 2025, the Argentine government took a progressive stance towards cryptocurrency, recognizing it as a digital asset. President Javier Milei’s administration has fostered this environment by initiating new legislation to encourage the growth of the cryptocurrency sector. The government’s key focus is: Allowing regulated use in transactions and contracts of crypto Ensure security and consumer protection within the crypto market Promotion of crypto adoption and investment in digital assets as part of the broader economy. Crypto Tax in Argentina 2025 Important note: Crypto is an intangible property, so holding crypto is not taxed, but profits or income from transactions are taxable, aligning with fiscal modernization efforts. Tax reporting: The Financial year runs from January 1 to December 31, and tax returns are due by June 30 of the following year. Crypto tax can be reported through AFIP’s online tax portal. Tax type Tax rate Tax applicability Capital gains tax (CGT) 15% Profits from selling/ exchanging crypto Income tax 5% to 35% Earnings from mining, staking, and payments Personal property tax 0.25%- 1.25% Year-end value of crypto holdings VAT 21% Crypto is used to buy goods and services International transfers 5% -15% Cross-border crypto transactions. Crypto License in Argentina There are no specific licenses in Argentina for crypto businesses; only the Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) registration is required to operate. The Resolution General 994/2024 defined the VASP, while Ley 277739 specified the regulatory (CNV) and functions of VASPs. All crypto companies must register if their transaction volume exceeds 35,000 UVA (approx $29,246). Exemptions for monthly volume below this threshold are also available. Penalty: Failure to register can result in the disqualification of the crypto platform and cease it from operating. Under Ley 27739, the VASP can engage in: Exchange of virtual assets for fiat currencies. Exchange of one virtual asset for another. Transfer of virtual assets. Custody and management of virtual assets. Financial services related to virtual assets offerings and sales. Crypto Adoption In Argentina User penetration rate: The crypto user penetration is expected to be 22.80% in 2025 and is projected to increase to 23.80% by 2026. The number of users in the crypto market is expected to reach 10.95 million by next year. Crypto revenue: The current projected crypto revenue is estimated to reach US$940.9 million in 2025. As the crypto market is growing rapidly in the region, the estimation for 2026 is growing at a rate of 16.02%, depicting US$1.1 billion crypto revenue by 2026. Crypto holdings: The Argentine government has not disclosed its crypto holdings yet; policies are prioritizing creating a framework for crypto regulations to protect investors and consumers. Conclusion Argentina’s recent policies and the government’s active efforts in the crypto space have promised further exploration of blockchain tokenization and open finance. The country is fully supporting high fintech adoption to balance security with modernization. The primary goal of the government is to establish a better digital framework to boost the economy with cryptocurrency and other digital assets. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-16T06:42:54,"Crypto is Going Mainstream and 'You Can’t Put the Genie Back in the Bottle,' Bitwise Says","The U.S. is on the verge of passing landmark crypto legislation, and if it succeeds, the impact could be profound, not only by unlocking growth, but by significantly reducing risk, asset manager Bitwise said in a report on Monday. The growth story is straightforward according to Bitwise. Regulatory clarity would empower major financial institutions, such as JPMorgan (JPM), BNY Mellon (BK), Nasdaq (NDAQ), to fully build in crypto, the report said. That means billions in new investment and a path to migrate trillions of traditional assets onto blockchain rails. The infrastructure is ready; it just needs Washington’s go-ahead, according to the asset manager. This week the House of Representatives is voting on the CLARITY Act, a crypto market structure bill, and the GENIUS Act, which regulates stablecoins in the U.S. Yesterday, the top democrat of the Senate Agriculture committee said the market structure bill needs serious changes . If these bills pass through Congress, ""you can’t put the genie back in the bottle,"" wrote Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise. The deeper, under appreciated shift will be in risk, wrote Hougan. Crypto’s reputation has been battered by collapses including FTX , Terra/Luna , 3AC , Celsius , Mt. Gox. These weren’t just failures of business models; they were failures of oversight. Without clear U.S. regulation, bad actors thrived in offshore shadows, and investors paid the price. Stronger laws wouldn’t have prevented every scandal, but they would’ve stopped many, the report said. Bitwise notes that crypto’s volatility, and previous 70%+ drawdowns, have kept institutions on the sidelines. If legislation eliminates the wildcard risk of offshore implosions, those extreme crashes may become far less frequent. And no, the political winds aren’t likely to reverse, Bitwise said. The GENIUS Act passed the Senate 68–30, with bipartisan support including 18 Democrats. Wall Street wants in, and as major institutions deepen their crypto footprints, political support will only grow. When BlackRock, JPMorgan, and millions of Americans are invested, crypto becomes part of the system, too embedded to ignore, and too integral to unwind, the report added.

2025-07-16T06:42:12,"Crypto Bulls Rejoice: Congresswoman Confirms Powell’s Imminent Firing","A single-word reply on X from Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R‑FL) — “Confirmed” — rocketed through the crypto markets early Wednesday, convincing a growing chorus of traders that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s tenure is measured in days, not months. Within minutes of Luna’s affirmation that “Jerome Powell is going to be fired. Firing is imminent,” prediction‑market odds of his ouster on Polymarket leapt to 26 percent, the highest reading this year, up from 16 percent only 24 hours earlier. A White‑House‑backed search is already under way. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, in an on‑record Bloomberg interview, acknowledged “a formal process that’s already starting” to identify Powell’s successor, adding that “there are a lot of good candidates inside and outside the Federal Reserve.” Related Reading: ‘Crypto Week’ Takes A Hit: US House Fails To Advance Key Acts President Donald Trump underscored the point during an impromptu press gaggle, repeating last week’s warning that “the renovations at the central bank were a fireable offense.” Those renovations — an over‑budget, $2.5 billion overhaul of the Fed’s historic Eccles Building — have become the legal pretext for dismissal, with Trump allies alleging “inefficiency” and “neglect of duty,” two of the three causes for removal spelled out in the Federal Reserve Act. Powell has asked the Fed’s inspector general to reopen its review of the project. Notably, Bill Pulte, the Federal Housing Finance Agency head and a longtime Powell critic, confirmed the rumors to his followers on X: “I heard from a very credible, bipartisan source, today, that Jerome Powell is considering resigning. This maps with both reports and also the talk in DC.” Crypto Markets Sense A Massive Bull Run The Bitcoin and crypto prices haven’t shown any reaction to the rumor yet. After piercing $123,000 on Monday, BTC is still 4.5 percent below the record high. The entire crypto market seems to be in a wait-and-see position. However, long-term, the implication could be profound for the crypto markets. “I cannot think of a more bullish catalyst for Bitcoin in the past five years than the complete and utter humiliation of Jerome Powell,” wrote macro commentator Julian Figueroa, pointing to what he called the “façade” of central‑bank independence collapsing in real time. Related Reading: Happy Ending: Crypto Hacker Returns Funds From $42 Million GMX Exploit Long‑time trader Byzantine General echoed the ambivalence: “Powell was actually a great Fed chair. But… if he resigns then it’s very likely that whoever comes next will lower rates, which is bullish for our cryptographic currencies.” Should President Trump succeed in replacing Powell with a more accommodating successor—one prepared to deliver the “three‑percentage‑point” rate cut he has publicly demanded—the Federal Reserve would likely be forced to shelve its balance‑sheet runoff precisely as Washington ramps up fresh fiscal stimulus. That synchronous pivot away from quantitative tightening would flip the liquidity regime from drain to deluge, recreating the macro backdrop that powered the crypto market’s 2020‑21 vertical ascent and positioning it for the next major bull run. At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $3.68 trillion.

2025-07-16T06:36:40,"How Bitcoin Could Hit $200K on Global Institutional Inflows Alone","“Institutional capital can no longer ignore the returns that Bitcoin is providing,” reported the Kobeissi Letter on Tuesday. The cryptocurrency cannot be ignored because it has yielded a 90% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the past 13 years, which no other asset can match. Even “conservative” funds are allocating 1% of their assets under management to Bitcoin as treasury trend momentum builds, they observed. Massive Institutional Inflows Currently, there is an estimated $31 trillion in institutional AUM in the United States, Kobeissi stated. “If just 1% of US institutional capital flows into Bitcoin, this could drive another $300 billion into the asset,” they said. A further $300 billion added to Bitcoin’s $2.34 trillion market capitalization would drive prices up around 13% which would put the asset at $133,000. This figure has been widely predicted by analysts as a short-term target. “Factor in global institutional AUM, and we could see $1 trillion+ flow into Bitcoin,” they said. Another $1 trillion added to the BTC market cap would drive prices up by 70%, which would put it closer to $200,000. “Bitcoin has simply become too big to ignore.” Bitcoin’s next catalyst has arrived: Simply put, institutional capital can no longer ignore the returns that Bitcoin is providing. When an asset provides a return of 90% in one year, it can be ruled an “outlier.” However, when an asset provides a 90% CAGR for 13 years… — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) July 15, 2025 All this is hypothetically achievable without any retail participation in markets. Institutions are already driving the current market rally. BlackRock , for example, has hoovered up a whopping 717,388 BTC, or 3.6% of the entire circulating supply. Meanwhile, Strategy has accumulated 601,550 BTC, 3% of the circulating supply. These two entities alone hold a whopping 6.6% of the entire Bitcoin supply, currently valued at $155 billion. As more institutional Bitcoin funds are launched, and more corporations and nation states stack the asset for their treasuries, the price can only go one way in the long term. BTC Price Outlook Bitcoin is still cooling from its July 14 all-time high and remains down 4.3% from that level. The asset was trading flat on the day at $117,850 at the time of writing, holding around support levels. It is possible that consolidation could continue for some time before the next leg up into the $130,000 range. The retreat has been caused by long-term holders taking profit , not institutions liquidating their stashes. Glassnode reported that this week saw “one of the largest BTC profit realization days this year, driven mostly by long-term holders.” The post How Bitcoin Could Hit $200K on Global Institutional Inflows Alone appeared first on CryptoPotato .",cryptopotato,https://cryptopotato.com/how-bitcoin-could-hit-200k-on-global-institutional-inflows-alone/,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|REGULATION","AA News|Crypto News|Bitcoin|Bitcoin (BTC) Price",cryptocompare

2025-07-16T06:34:08,"First Bitcoin, Then Ethereum On the Move! Analysts Explain Their Expectations: ""ETH May Be on the Verge of an Unprecedented Rise!""","Bitcoin (BTC) made a major push at the beginning of the week, surpassing $123,000 and breaking a new record. While this rise had limited impact on altcoins, Ethereum (ETH) and other altcoins began to surge as profit-taking began in BTC. Ethereum Goes on the Attack! At this point, Ethereum reclaimed the $3,000 level for the first time since February 1st and reached a 5-month high of $3,150. Analytics firm Swissblock said that one of the key drivers behind Ethereum's rise is the capital rotation from Bitcoin. Analysts noted that Bitcoin's previous four bullish waves this year lasted between 15 and 30 days. They noted that the current rally has reached its 12th day, and that profit-taking may begin in BTC after that. They also noted that capital flowing out of BTC could flow into altcoins, particularly ETH, which could further boost ETH. Analysts also noted that the ETH/BTC ratio broke upwards for the first time since May, signaling a trend reversal. They noted that ETH/BTC had broken above its 200-day moving average for the first time in a year, indicating medium- to long-term upward momentum for ETH. Bullish Predictions for Ethereum Are Increasing! Pseudonymous crypto analyst Merlijn The Trader also argued that Ethereum could experience an unprecedented rally. Accordingly, the analyst claimed that ETH could follow a trajectory similar to Bitcoin's 2018-2021 market cycle. If Ethereum follows BTC's 2018-2021 cycle, it could experience a 1,100% rally. He noted that ETH's current price movements mirror those of BTC between 2028 and 2021, particularly the rates of increase and correction being identical. According to the analyst, ETH could experience the same 1,100% increase as BTC from now on. This means Ethereum could potentially rally to around $18,205. While the analyst's chart suggests a significant rally is imminent for Ethereum, it alone isn't enough to trigger a surge. Don't base your investment decisions on a single piece of data or analysis. These analyses are often fallible and are merely helpful data that has never been proven 100% accurate. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: First Bitcoin, Then Ethereum On the Move!

2025-07-16T06:30:10,"‘You Can’t Put the Genie Back’: Bitwise CIO Reveals Why Crypto May Never Be the Same Again","The conversation around cryptocurrency in the United States appears to be entering a new phase as key legislation gains traction in Congress. According to Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan, the passage of several pro-crypto bills under discussion in Washington could have lasting implications for the market. In a note to clients, Hougan emphasized the long-term structural shift underway, stating that once these bills pass, “you can’t put the genie back in the bottle.” The legislative push, dubbed “Crypto Week” by Hougan, follows a declaration by the US House of Representatives to advance three major pieces of digital currency-focused legislation. These include the GENIUS Act, which aims to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins; the CLARITY Act, designed to regulate broader digital currency assets; and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, which would prohibit the introduction of a US central bank digital currency (CBDC). The GENIUS Act has already cleared the Senate, placing it a step closer to becoming law. Legislative Clarity Could Reduce Structural Risk in Crypto Hougan argues that regulatory clarity could play a pivotal role in reducing systemic risk across the digital asset industry. He noted that many of the high-profile failures in the digital currency space, including FTX, Terra (Luna), Celsius, and Mt. Gox, were enabled by a lack of oversight . In the absence of defined rules, offshore platforms with inadequate internal controls and auditing were able to thrive, resulting in significant losses for users. He contends that proper legislation could have prevented such failures. “If clear regulations had allowed safer versions of these services to exist in the US, many of the historical blow-ups might not have occurred,” Hougan stated. Regulatory guidelines, according to the note, could also facilitate entry for traditional financial institutions, allowing for crypto custody and services through familiar, regulated channels. That shift could improve investor confidence and potentially limit the frequency and severity of market drawdowns. Hougan also believes that the passage of these bills could diminish the likelihood of future extreme price crashes. While Bitcoin remains one of the best-performing assets over the last 15 years, its history includes multiple drawdowns exceeding 70%. Hougan argues that enhanced regulation could limit the impact of unpredictable events that trigger such volatility. Bipartisan Support and Institutional Buy-In Signal Lasting Momentum While some may question whether future administrations could reverse pro-crypto momentum, Hougan remains unconcerned. He pointed out that support for legislation like the GENIUS Act has been bipartisan, passing the Senate 68-30 with significant backing from both Democrats and Republicans. He attributes this cross-party alignment not only to generational voter interests but also to Wall Street’s growing involvement in crypto . According to Hougan, as financial institutions like BlackRock, JPMorgan, and Morgan Stanley expand their crypto operations, the likelihood of political reversal diminishes. “As a broader array of investors and firms becomes involved in crypto, it will be increasingly difficult for politicians to align against it,” he said. Should these legislative efforts succeed, Hougan concludes that crypto is positioned to transition further into the mainstream. With clearer rules, reduced risk, and rising institutional support, the digital asset market may be entering a new era of growth and maturity.

Key Takeaways: U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs extended their inflow streak to nine days, adding $403 million on Tuesday. Despite gains, outflows hit Grayscale’s GBTC, Fidelity’s FBTC, and Ark & 21Shares’ ARKB. Ethereum spot ETFs also recorded eight straight days of inflows, adding $192 million. Leading the charge was BlackRock’s IBIT, which alone saw $416.35 million in new money, followed by VanEck’s HODL with $19 million. Other funds such as Grayscale’s Mini Bitcoin Trust and Bitwise’s BITB also reported positive inflows for the day. Notable Outflows Hit Grayscale, Fidelity, and Ark Bitcoin Funds However, the gains were partially offset by outflows from three funds: Grayscale’s GBTC lost $41.22 million, Fidelity’s FBTC saw $23 million exit, and Ark & 21Shares’ ARKB dropped by $6.21 million. Spot bitcoin ETFs have now amassed a cumulative total of $53.07 billion in net inflows, with $4.4 billion added over the past nine trading days alone. The surge builds on a strong run that began in April, during which these funds have drawn nearly $17 billion. Ethereum spot ETFs have followed suit, marking their eighth straight day of net inflows, with $192.33 million added on Tuesday. Bitcoin currently trades at $117,373, holding steady near a key support level despite pulling back from a recent all-time high of $123,000 set earlier this week. “Bitcoin has been able to maintain a solid position at around $118K after core CPI data was lower than expected, prompting speculation that the Fed will be more likely to cut interest rates in September, potentially leading to a surge of demand for bitcoin,” said Nick Ruck, director of LVRG Research. #BTC we’re back at $116K as planned.

On Friday, 11 spot Bitcoin ETF products reported combined inflows totaling $1.03 billion, following $1.17 billion the previous day. Recently, BlackRock reported earning more revenue from IBIT than from its flagship iShares Core S&P 500 ETF. 95% Approval Chance for Spot Solana, XRP ETFS As reported, Bloomberg’s senior ETF analysts have assigned a 95% chance that the SEC will approve spot ETFs for Solana, XRP, and Litecoin this year, raising their previous odds from 90% amid growing optimism for institutional crypto products. They also expect a crypto index ETF tracking multiple assets could gain approval as early as this week, signaling broader access to altcoins for traditional investors. Beyond ETFs, institutional Bitcoin demand is spreading into corporate treasuries. Japan’s Metaplanet recently bought $93 million worth of BTC , becoming the fifth-largest corporate holder with a stack exceeding 16,300 BTC. France’s The Blockchain Group and the UK’s Smarter Web Company also made new BTC treasury allocations this week, purchasing $12.5 million and $24.3 million worth of Bitcoin respectively.

According to analyst Rekt Capital, the PI Cycle Top uses two moving averages to signal when Bitcoin may be nearing its top. Historically, these moving averages, especially the 111-day average, have accurately predicted the end of previous bull markets. Recently, this faster-moving average has been rising sharply. Back on June 1, it was tracking around $92,000, but now it’s already near $98,000, just under $100K. This quick rise shows how strong the current price momentum is. What’s important here is how fast the predicted “crossover,” when the two moving averages intersect, is moving forward in time. A few days ago, the crossover was projected for April 2027, but now it’s shifted to February 2027. And if Bitcoin continues to consolidate or climb, that crossover could move even closer — possibly into 2026 or even late 2025. Why does this matter? Because when the crossover occurs, it has typically marked the top of the bull market. If the trend continues, we could see this crossover hit when Bitcoin is priced somewhere between $130,000 to $170,000, or even more if momentum keeps building. The key takeaway: While we may still be early in this bull run, the data is telling us that the window to take profits could arrive as early as the second half of 2025. The PI Cycle Top Indicator won’t act alone, but it’s one of the most reliable tools we have to track when the cycle might end.

The inflation increase appears to have affected investor sentiment. After reaching a new high above $123,000 on Monday, Bitcoin has since declined by roughly 5.4% from that peak, with its price currently trading just above $116,000. The broader crypto market also reacted to the news, with the global crypto market cap valuation dropping by nearly 7% in the past day amid renewed uncertainty about future interest rate policy. While Bitcoin has exhibited a strong uptrend in recent weeks, the latest pullback introduces short-term volatility that analysts are watching closely. One particularly notable development occurred on-chain: a transfer of 10,000 BTC, valued at roughly $1.2 billion, from a dormant address last active over a decade ago. Related Reading: The Bitcoin Liquidity Supercycle Has Just Begun, Says Hedge Fund CEO Historic Bitcoin Transfer Raises Eyebrows, but No Signs of Exchange Activity CryptoQuant analyst Carmelo Alemán shared insights into the large transaction in a recent post titled “10,000 Historic BTC Move On-Chain.” According to Alemán, the transaction occurred on July 14 at 16:17 UTC, moving 10,000 BTC from address ‘bc1q84…7ef6k ‘ to ‘bc1qmu….8v2p.’ These coins had not moved in over 10 years, indicating they likely originated from early miners during Bitcoin’s earliest phases when the block reward was 50 BTC. Alemán noted that such old unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) often trigger concern about potential sell-offs, but in this case, further analysis suggests a more neutral interpretation. The movement of old coins can occur for various reasons, including UTXO consolidation, wallet upgrades, or potential sales. Alemán explained that this transfer displayed characteristics consistent with consolidation for efficiency and security purposes. For example, the transaction used 16 different inputs, which can help reduce future transaction fees. Additionally, no corresponding inflow to centralized exchanges (CEXs) was detected, typically a key signal when holders intend to liquidate. The analyst also pointed out that two small test transactions were sent to the receiving address before the full transfer. These included a 0.00089 BTC and a 1 BTC transaction, commonly used to verify wallet accessibility before moving a large sum. Interestingly, two hours after the initial transaction, the same destination wallet received another transfer of 10,009 BTC, bringing the total to more than 20,000 BTC moved in the span of a few hours. Implications for Market Behavior and On-Chain Trends While the transaction did not lead to immediate market selling, it has added to ongoing discussions about the role of long-term holders in Bitcoin’s supply dynamics. Large transfers from early addresses are rare and often interpreted as strategic reorganization of funds. Alemán noted that the absence of exchange-related activity makes it unlikely that the coins are being liquidated in the short term.

Hedera Price prediction highlights HBAR could reach $0.750 by the end of 2025 if bullish trends continue. The Long-term forecasts suggest HBAR could hit $2.20 by 2030, indicating stable growth potential. Hedera has been making waves in the crypto space, having entered the top 20 digital assets by market cap in 2024, and now eyeing a potential leap into the top 10 by the end of 2025. With increasing real-world use cases, institutional interest, and strategic partnerships, many are closely tracking HBAR price prediction 2025 to gauge how high the token can rise. With major companies like Google, IBM, and Chainlink Labs backing the project, and talks of an HBAR ETF approval, many are asking: Will HBAR Price Hit $1?

All-time low. $0.01001 (January 2nd, 2020). Hedera Price Analysis: H1 2025 Hedera experienced a volatile first half of 2025. After peaking at $0.40 in mid-January, the HBAR price began a steady decline. External factors and waning investor engagement were evident in the TVL, which contributed to this downturn. Ultimately, HBAR was pushed into a converging falling wedge pattern, hitting a low of $0.125 in early April. However, the tide began to turn in the second week of April. A broader crypto rally provided a much-needed lift for HBAR, breaking free from the wedge and bouncing off a robust support zone that had previously fueled a rally in Q4 2024. This zone, validated by the Fixed Range Volume Profile (FRVP) indicator, indicated strong buying interest and set the stage for a sharp rebound. In a remarkable surge, HBAR climbed nearly 80%, rising from $0.125 to $0.228 between April and mid-May. Unfortunately, this momentum was short-lived, as geopolitical tensions escalated in mid-May, causing HBAR’s price to retreat back to its April lows, forming another parallel declining wedge on the chart. By the end of June, HBAR remained within that channel but started to see bears losing grip to bulls, when entering July, momentum blasted, breaking the upper border of the parallel channel. Hedera Price Targets July 2025 Precisely in July, from the declining parallel channel, Hedera saw strong demand starting from $0.125 in late June to mid-July, where HBAR spiked 108% to $0.26, piercing through all short-term and long-term EMA bands. This movement followed a boost from the ceasefire announcement in late June and was further bolstered by Bitcoin hitting an all-time high of $123,231. As of mid-July, Hedera experienced a slight halt as Bitcoin and the overall market witnessed early profit booking, marking a cooldown phase before another potential rally. If the bulls regain strength and achieve a daily close above $0.270, HBAR price could potentially retest the $0.34 and $0.40 resistance levels in July or the coming months. Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High HBAR Price Prediction July 2025 $0.125 $0.27 $0.40 Hedera Price Prediction 2025 (H2) Looking ahead, if the momentum persists, HBAR price might even reach $0.75 by year-end. However, on the downside, failing to maintain the $0.190 support zone could pull it down towards multi-month support at $0.125. Below this level, the price could even drop toward $0.072. Also, while TVL was previously down, it has witnessed a resurgence, with investor trust reflected in TVL increasing from $75 million to $114 million within the last 30 days. Hedera’s internal developments also tell a promising story. The ecosystem continues to expand, with the launch of its first native hardware wallet, Citadel , and an AI-based tool called the Hedera Agent Kit , which simplifies token creation. Another significant project, HashSphere, is set to launch in Q3 2025, aiming to provide a private, regulated blockchain for stablecoin-based payments and asset management. Moreover, Hedera underwent a rebranding on May 15, with the HBAR Foundation now known as the Hedera Foundation and the Governing Council rebranded as the Hedera Council. This restructuring positions Hedera for a stronger future, signaling maturity within its ecosystem.

2025-07-16T05:55:57,"Jameson Lopp proposes that BTC owners avoid quantum-vulnerable addresses.","Jameson Lopp, CTO and co-founder of the self-custody platform Casa, along with five other developers, has proposed new strategies to counter the potential threat of quantum computing. Their proposal aims to steer Bitcoin holders to adopt more secure, quantum-resistant storage methods and implement additional protective measures. Quantum algorithms are a threat to Bitcoin’s cryptographic pillars Crypto experts say quantum computing could break Bitcoin’s encryption system. The network applies cryptographic security measures such as the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) to protect wallets and SHA-256 to confirm mining and transactions. Quantum algorithms, however, pose a threat to these systems. For example, Shor’s algorithm might allow attackers to solve the math underlying these protections, making it possible to expose a private key from a known public key. Many Pay-to-Public-Key (P2PK) and Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash (P2PKH) addresses are exposed, which puts an estimated 25% of Bitcoin’s total supply in danger, according to a Deloitte study. Furthermore, with identifiable public keys, Satoshi Nakamoto’s dormant wallets would also be vulnerable to quantum attacks . The same applies to another quantum algorithm that threatens the security of Bitcoin — Grover’s algorithm , which cuts the effective security of SHA-256 by 50%. In May, Lopp had cautioned that quantum signature schemes have become significantly larger, which could reopen debates about Bitcoin’s ability to handle high transaction volumes. He also warned that if a quantum computer could break the ECDSA pillar, it would be disastrous—stolen BTC will fill the markets, undermining trust and possibly triggering a price collapse. Experts have articulated that existing quantum computers cannot crack ECDSA now. Some anticipate that quantum computing will become a real threat in at least 10 years, seeing how engineers are still working on building fault-tolerant systems. However, some analysts believe Bitcoin could be in trouble in the next five years if quantum computers advance beyond expectations, an opinion many have brushed off as unlikely. Earlier, Lopp argued that while it’s not easy to estimate how long they have before quantum computing becomes a real threat, the Bitcoin community should collaborate to come up with solutions before it grows into an existential crisis. Lopp’s proposal would have BTC owners shift to post-quantum secure addresses Lopp had help from five other developers to draft the Bitcoin improvement plan. In the proposal, they iterated that Bitcoin is under threat, noting that a successful quantum attack would hurt economies and possibly the entire ecosystem. The proposal also details that miners would have to transfer funds to post-quantum secure addresses and restrict Bitcoin spending within five years. It stated: “It turns quantum security into a private incentive. Fail to upgrade [to a new address type] and you will certainly lose access to your funds.” Ideally, the plan includes incentives for Bitcoin owners who shift to more secure addresses. In his proposal, Lopp also references BIP 360, an upgrade created by Anduro’s Senior Protocol Engineer, Hunter Beast, to introduce address formats incorporating post-quantum cryptography at varying security levels. Other developers, such as Michael B. Casey, Director of Engineering at Marathon, have also contributed their own ideas to strengthen Bitcoin’s defenses. Casey introduced the hourglass narrative, dictating that vulnerable wallet types like pay-to-public-key reduce their number of transactions. He argued that fewer transactions would give the community time to look into other alternatives, at least delaying access to tokens to eight months from a few hours. He further noted that the move would cause hackers to target the older wallets that many people rarely use. Meanwhile, tech giants like Google and Microsoft have poured significant resources into advancing quantum computing. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-07-16T05:54:09,"Bad News Came Yesterday for the Three Major US Cryptocurrency Bills! Trump Intervened, Problem Solved! Crucial Vote Today! Here Are the Details","Cryptocurrency week in the US has started with negativity. Accordingly, cryptocurrency legislation that was expected to be voted on in the US House of Representatives this week has been postponed due to a procedural vote failure. In the vote held yesterday, the proposal, which would have paved the way for the discussion of three important cryptocurrency bills, was rejected with 223 “no” votes against 196 “yes” votes. Following the rejection decision, there was a positive development in laws that are of great importance to US President Donald Trump. Trump intervened and announced a meeting with House members who oppose the procedural agreement for the GENIUS Act. At this point, Trump said that an agreement had been reached to hold a vote again on July 16 and advance the stablecoin bill in the US. Donald Trump said on Truth Social that he met with 11 of the 12 people needed for the passage of the GENIUS Act in the Oval Office. According to Trump's post, the group agreed to vote on the morning of July 16. House Speaker Mike Johnson joined the meeting by phone and stated that he was ready to move forward with a vote as soon as possible. This update came after the House failed to hold a procedural vote on the bill. “I'm currently in the Oval Office at the White House with 11 of the 12 members of the House of Representatives whose approval is needed for passage of the GENIUS Act. After a brief discussion, they all agreed to vote yes tomorrow morning. I hope the vote will take place as soon as possible tomorrow. I extend my gratitude to the representatives for their prompt and positive response.” What Are These Laws? This week, dubbed “Crypto Week,” features two important bills on the House agenda: the National Innovation Guidelines and Establishment for U.S. Stablecoins Act (GENIUS) and the Digital Asset Market Openness Act (Clarity). The GENIUS law stipulates that stablecoin issuances must be fully collateralized only by US dollars or similar liquid assets, requires annual audits for issuers with a market capitalization over $50 billion, and establishes rules for overseas stablecoin issuance. The Clarity Act, meanwhile, aims to clarify the regulatory framework for crypto assets by offering a more comprehensive approach. It clarifies the roles and jurisdictions of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), as well as requiring digital asset service providers to notify individual investors and segregate client funds from company assets. *This is not investment advice.
