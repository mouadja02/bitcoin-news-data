2025-07-15T21:51:33,"ETH News Today: Can Ethereum Flip Bitcoin in the Next Bull Run?","The possibility of Ethereum overtaking Bitcoin stirs excitement in the crypto world. As the next market surge approaches, many wonder if ETH might finally outperform BTC. This article delves into the potential for Ethereum's rise and explores which cryptocurrencies are poised for significant growth. This analysis is delivered by Outset PR, a crypto communications agency that combines high-touch strategy with data-driven performance metrics. Ethereum Price Action: Poised for Potential Growth Source: tradingview Ethereum's price currently floats between two thousand six hundred and three thousand one hundred. The crypto has seen a near 18% bump in the last week, hinting at bullish momentum. Its ten-day moving average of just over three thousand matches its 100-day average, showing stability. With its RSI above 60, Ethereum isn’t in overbought territory, suggesting room for growth. If Ethereum breaks its nearest resistance at three thousand three hundred, it could climb to its second resistance near three thousand nine hundred—a growth potential of around 23%. However, it needs to stay above its support at two thousand three hundred to maintain momentum. Overall, signs point to possible positive movement ahead. Bitcoin Steadily Rises: Potential To Break Key Resistance Source: tradingview Bitcoin's price is riding a positive wave, oscillating between $111,000 and $122,000. It's witnessing strong upward momentum, with a significant climb of around 14.5% over the last month. Currently, it's only a modest leap away from surpassing a resistance point at $126,000. If BTC can break through this, the next strong point lies around $137,000. Such moves could represent a potential growth of around 13% from the current range. The current trends indicate healthy interest and possible further gains, with the market showing signs of bullishness. Enthusiasts are watching closely as Bitcoin inches towards new frontiers.

2025-07-15T21:50:16,"Bitcoin Holdings: Planet Ventures’ Strategic Expansion with New BTC Acquisition","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Holdings: Planet Ventures’ Strategic Expansion with New BTC Acquisition In a significant move that underscores the growing institutional confidence in digital currencies, Canada-listed Planet Ventures has once again made headlines. The company recently announced a strategic acquisition of an additional 3.02 Bitcoin (BTC), significantly bolstering its Bitcoin holdings and signaling a continued commitment to the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Who is Planet Ventures and Why Are They Investing in Crypto? Planet Ventures , a publicly traded company based in Canada, has been steadily making its mark in the digital asset space. While many traditional firms are still contemplating their entry into the volatile yet lucrative cryptocurrency market, Planet Ventures has chosen a proactive approach. Their strategy aligns with a growing number of forward-thinking corporations that view Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a legitimate treasury reserve asset. This move by Planet Ventures is indicative of a broader trend where companies are seeking alternative stores of value and growth opportunities outside of traditional financial instruments. By diversifying into digital assets, they aim to hedge against inflation, capitalize on potential appreciation, and signal a modern, innovative outlook to their investors. This foresight positions them among the early adopters in the corporate world. Decoding Planet Ventures’ Growing Bitcoin Holdings The recent announcement details the acquisition of an additional 3.02 BTC. This incremental purchase might seem modest on its own, but it pushes Planet Ventures’ total Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 19.71 BTC. For a company to publicly disclose and consistently increase its Bitcoin reserves speaks volumes about its conviction in the long-term value proposition of the digital gold. What does 19.71 BTC represent? While the exact fiat value fluctuates daily with market prices, this cumulative figure positions Planet Ventures as a notable player among publicly listed companies with Bitcoin on their balance sheets. It signifies a calculated accumulation strategy, potentially aimed at building a robust digital treasury that can appreciate over time and provide a hedge against economic uncertainties and traditional financial system risks. The Rationale Behind This Latest BTC Acquisition Every BTC acquisition by a public company is typically driven by a well-thought-out strategy. For Planet Ventures, this latest purchase likely stems from a combination of factors. It could be a response to current market conditions, perhaps seeing a favorable entry point, or simply a continuation of a pre-defined dollar-cost averaging strategy designed to mitigate volatility over time. The decision to make another BTC acquisition underscores a belief in Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition: its decentralized nature, scarcity, and potential as a global, censorship-resistant store of value. Companies like Planet Ventures are increasingly recognizing Bitcoin as a viable alternative to traditional cash reserves, which are subject to inflationary pressures and diminishing returns in low-interest-rate environments. This strategic move highlights a long-term vision for their corporate treasury. Broader Implications for Corporate Crypto Investment Planet Ventures’ consistent activity in the crypto space contributes to a broader narrative of increasing corporate crypto investment . This trend, spearheaded by companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla, validates Bitcoin and other digital assets as legitimate components of a corporate treasury strategy. It signals to the wider market that cryptocurrencies are maturing beyond speculative assets into fundamental financial instruments. The benefits for companies engaging in crypto investment are clear: potential for significant capital appreciation, diversification of treasury assets, and an appeal to a new generation of investors. However, challenges remain, including market volatility, evolving regulatory landscapes, and the need for robust security measures to protect these digital holdings. Despite these hurdles, the momentum for corporate adoption appears to be growing, indicating a shift in traditional finance. What’s Next for Planet Ventures’ Digital Assets Strategy? With their total Bitcoin holdings now at 19.71 BTC, what does the future hold for Planet Ventures’ digital assets strategy? It’s reasonable to expect that the company will continue to monitor market conditions closely and potentially make further acquisitions if they align with their long-term financial objectives. Their consistent approach suggests a strategic, rather than opportunistic, engagement with the crypto market, focusing on sustained growth. Beyond Bitcoin, it will be interesting to observe if Planet Ventures diversifies its digital assets portfolio to include other major cryptocurrencies or perhaps explore opportunities in decentralized finance (DeFi) or non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in the future. Their current focus on Bitcoin, however, indicates a foundational belief in the leading cryptocurrency as a primary store of value and a cornerstone of their treasury management. Planet Ventures’ latest acquisition of 3.02 BTC, pushing its total holdings to 19.71 BTC, is more than just a transaction; it’s a statement. It reinforces the growing confidence among public companies in Bitcoin as a strategic asset and highlights the ongoing shift in corporate treasury management. As the digital economy continues to evolve, companies like Planet Ventures are paving the way for mainstream institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies, setting a precedent for others to follow.

2025-07-15T21:40:19,"GameStop Bitcoin: Ryan Cohen Unveils Strategic Inflation Hedge","BitcoinWorld GameStop Bitcoin: Ryan Cohen Unveils Strategic Inflation Hedge In a fascinating turn for the retail gaming giant, GameStop has once again captured the attention of both traditional finance and the cryptocurrency world. The big news? GameStop views its Bitcoin holdings not as a speculative gamble, but as a crucial inflation hedge. This revelation from CEO Ryan Cohen provides a deeper insight into the company’s evolving financial philosophy, moving beyond its meme stock status to a more calculated approach to treasury management. For anyone tracking corporate crypto adoption or the future of retail, GameStop’s latest move offers a compelling case study. Why is GameStop Embracing Bitcoin as an Inflation Hedge? The concept of an inflation hedge is simple yet powerful: it’s an asset designed to retain or increase its value during periods of rising inflation, protecting purchasing power. In today’s economic climate, with persistent inflationary pressures, companies are increasingly seeking ways to safeguard their balance sheets. For GameStop, the decision to hold Bitcoin is a deliberate and strategic move in this direction. Unlike traditional assets that might erode in value due to inflation, Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and finite supply of 21 million coins are often cited as its core strengths as a hedge. Proponents argue that its scarcity makes it resistant to the debasement of fiat currencies. GameStop’s CEO Ryan Cohen articulated this clearly, emphasizing that their Bitcoin holdings are specifically for this purpose, rather than an attempt to chase market trends or replicate the strategies of other companies. This approach contrasts sharply with some earlier corporate crypto adoptions, which were sometimes perceived as more speculative or driven by a desire to gain exposure to a rapidly appreciating asset. GameStop’s stance signals a maturity in its understanding of digital assets, positioning Bitcoin as a fundamental component of its treasury strategy designed to protect its substantial cash reserves against economic volatility. Ryan Cohen’s Vision: A Unique GameStop Strategy At the heart of GameStop’s bold financial moves is CEO Ryan Cohen . Known for his transformative work with Chewy and his activist investor background, Cohen has brought a distinct, independent vision to GameStop. His statement that GameStop follows its own approach and does not seek to replicate others’ models is crucial. This isn’t about following the crowd; it’s about charting a unique course tailored to GameStop’s specific needs and strengths. Cohen’s philosophy appears to prioritize long-term stability and resilience over short-term gains. This is evident in GameStop’s strong balance sheet, which boasts over $9 billion in cash and securities. This significant liquidity provides the company with immense flexibility and a cushion against market fluctuations. By allocating a portion of these substantial reserves into Bitcoin as an inflation hedge, Cohen is demonstrating a proactive risk management strategy. It suggests a belief that traditional cash holdings alone may not be sufficient to preserve value in an unpredictable economic landscape. This distinctive GameStop strategy underscores a commitment to financial prudence while also embracing innovative solutions. It’s a testament to Cohen’s leadership, which has consistently challenged conventional wisdom and sought to redefine GameStop’s place in the modern economy, moving it beyond its legacy as a brick-and-mortar retailer. The Broader Implications of Corporate Crypto Holdings GameStop’s move isn’t isolated; it’s part of a growing trend of companies exploring or adopting crypto holdings as part of their treasury management. While MicroStrategy has famously gone all-in on Bitcoin, viewing it as a primary treasury asset, and Tesla briefly accepted Bitcoin for payments, GameStop’s nuanced approach as a pure inflation hedge offers another model for corporate adoption. Benefits of Corporate Crypto Holdings: Inflation Protection: As GameStop demonstrates, Bitcoin’s scarcity can offer a hedge against fiat currency devaluation. Diversification: Adding uncorrelated assets like Bitcoin can diversify a company’s treasury, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Innovation and Forward-Thinking: Holding crypto can signal a company’s willingness to embrace new technologies and financial paradigms, appealing to a tech-savvy investor base. Potential for Appreciation: While GameStop emphasizes hedging, the long-term growth potential of Bitcoin remains an attractive underlying factor for many corporate holders. Challenges and Considerations: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can fluctuate wildly, posing significant short-term risks to balance sheets. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, which can create compliance challenges. Accounting Treatment: Current accounting rules often require Bitcoin to be treated as an intangible asset, leading to potential impairment charges if its value drops. Security Risks: Storing significant amounts of cryptocurrency requires robust cybersecurity measures to prevent theft. The increasing number of companies like GameStop, Tesla, and MicroStrategy holding Bitcoin signifies a paradigm shift. It indicates a growing acceptance of digital assets beyond speculative trading, integrating them into fundamental corporate finance strategies. This trend could pave the way for more mainstream adoption and greater stability in the crypto markets over time. What Does This Mean for GameStop’s Future and Investors? For GameStop, this strategic allocation of capital into Bitcoin as an inflation hedge could have several implications. Firstly, it reinforces the company’s commitment to protecting its financial health in an unpredictable economic environment. This prudent approach may reassure long-term investors who are looking for stability beyond the speculative fervor that once surrounded the stock. Secondly, it positions GameStop as an innovative player, willing to leverage new financial instruments to achieve its objectives. This could attract a new segment of investors who are interested in companies that are forward-thinking in their treasury management and embrace digital assets. While the immediate impact on GameStop’s stock price might be tied to broader market sentiment around crypto, the underlying strategic rationale is about long-term value preservation. For investors, understanding GameStop’s rationale is key. This isn’t a pivot to becoming a crypto company, but rather a sophisticated use of a digital asset within a traditional corporate finance framework. It highlights the evolving role of Bitcoin from a niche investment to a recognized tool for hedging against macroeconomic risks. Monitoring GameStop’s balance sheet and how these Bitcoin holdings perform against inflation will be crucial for assessing the success of this strategy. A Strategic Play in a Volatile World GameStop’s decision to hold Bitcoin as an inflation hedge, championed by CEO Ryan Cohen, marks a significant moment in the intersection of traditional corporate finance and digital assets. It underscores a pragmatic and independent GameStop strategy focused on long-term financial resilience. By leveraging its robust balance sheet and adopting a nuanced approach to its crypto holdings , GameStop is not just participating in the crypto space; it’s defining its own path. This move highlights Bitcoin’s growing recognition as a legitimate tool for treasury management, offering a protective shield against the erosive effects of inflation. As the economic landscape continues to evolve, GameStop’s strategic foresight in utilizing Bitcoin inflation hedge capabilities may well serve as a blueprint for other companies navigating an uncertain future.

2025-07-15T21:30:23,"Core Foundation Unveils Revolutionary Rev+ Model: A New Era for Crypto Revenue Sharing","BitcoinWorld Core Foundation Unveils Revolutionary Rev+ Model: A New Era for Crypto Revenue Sharing The cryptocurrency landscape is constantly evolving, with innovations pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. For those deeply invested in the future of decentralized finance, a significant development from the Core Foundation is poised to reshape how value is distributed within blockchain ecosystems. The organization behind Core, the robust Bitcoin-based, EVM-compatible Layer 1 network, has just launched an groundbreaking initiative: the Rev+ revenue-sharing program. This move isn’t just a technical upgrade; it’s a strategic pivot towards a more equitable and sustainable economic model for all participants. What is the Rev+ Model and Why Does It Matter? At its core, the Rev+ model is a pioneering mechanism designed to distribute a portion of the network’s gas fee revenue back to key contributors within the Core ecosystem. Traditionally, gas fees primarily compensate miners or validators for processing transactions. While essential, this model often leaves other crucial ecosystem participants, such as stablecoin issuers, application developers, and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), without direct financial incentives from network activity. The Core Foundation’s Rev+ program directly addresses this gap. By allocating gas fee revenue to these vital entities, Rev+ aims to: Incentivize Growth: Directly reward those who bring users and activity to the network. Foster Sustainability: Provide a recurring revenue stream for projects, reducing reliance on grants or venture capital. Promote Innovation: Encourage the development of high-quality applications and stablecoins on the Core blockchain. Enhance Decentralization: Empower DAOs with resources to govern and develop the ecosystem further. This approach marks a significant shift, moving beyond simple token emissions to create a self-sustaining economic loop that benefits everyone contributing to the network’s vitality. How Does Crypto Revenue Sharing Work with Rev+? The mechanics of the crypto revenue sharing within the Rev+ program are designed to be transparent and merit-based. According to reports, the model distributes gas fee revenue based on user activity and contribution metrics. This means that the more a stablecoin is used, the more an application is interacted with, or the more a DAO contributes to governance and development, the greater their share of the distributed revenue. Let’s break down the primary beneficiaries and their roles: Beneficiary Type Role in Ecosystem How Rev+ Benefits Them Stablecoin Issuers Provide liquidity and stability to the ecosystem, facilitating transactions and DeFi activities. Receive a share of gas fees generated by transactions involving their stablecoins, incentivizing adoption and usage. Developers Build decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and tools that drive user engagement and utility. Earn revenue based on the activity their dApps generate, creating a sustainable business model for building on Core. DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) Govern and manage various aspects of the ecosystem, including treasury management, protocol upgrades, and community initiatives. Receive funds to support their operations, development, and community-driven proposals, strengthening decentralized governance. This targeted distribution ensures that those who are actively fostering adoption and utility are directly rewarded, creating a powerful feedback loop for growth. It’s a smart way to align incentives across the entire ecosystem, moving beyond speculative value to intrinsic utility. The Significance of a Bitcoin EVM for Rev+ The Core network’s foundation as a Bitcoin EVM is crucial to understanding the full potential of the Rev+ model. By combining the security and decentralization of Bitcoin with the programmability and developer-friendliness of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), Core offers a unique and powerful platform. This hybrid architecture means that developers familiar with Ethereum’s robust tooling and smart contract capabilities can easily build on Core, while users benefit from Bitcoin’s unparalleled trust and established network effect. For Rev+, the Bitcoin EVM integration means: Enhanced Security: Leveraging Bitcoin’s proof-of-work security model for the underlying Layer 1 provides a robust foundation for financial applications. Broad Developer Adoption: The EVM compatibility attracts a vast pool of existing Ethereum developers, accelerating dApp deployment and user growth. Interoperability Potential: Bridges between Bitcoin and EVM environments open up new possibilities for cross-chain functionality and liquidity. This unique blend positions Core not just as another Layer 1, but as a bridge between the two largest blockchain ecosystems, creating a fertile ground for the Rev+ model to thrive and distribute significant value. Exploring Core as a Leading Layer 1 Blockchain The Core network is rapidly establishing itself as a significant Layer 1 blockchain in the competitive crypto space. Its design principles emphasize decentralization, scalability, and security, aiming to provide a robust infrastructure for a wide range of decentralized applications, from DeFi protocols to NFTs and GameFi. Key features that make Core a compelling Layer 1 include: Satoshi Plus Consensus: A unique hybrid consensus mechanism that combines delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) with Bitcoin’s hash power, ensuring both decentralization and security. EVM Compatibility: Full compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, allowing for seamless migration and development of dApps. Native Bitcoin Integration: Deep integration with Bitcoin, enabling the use of BTC as gas and for other utilities within the Core ecosystem. The introduction of Rev+ further strengthens Core’s position as a leading Layer 1. By directly rewarding active participation, it creates a virtuous cycle: more developers and stablecoin issuers are attracted, leading to more user activity, which in turn generates more revenue for distribution, fueling further growth. This economic model is designed to attract and retain the best projects and talent, fostering a vibrant and self-sustaining ecosystem. What are the Actionable Insights for Participants? For anyone involved in the crypto space – whether you’re a developer, a stablecoin issuer, a DAO member, or simply a user – the launch of Rev+ presents several actionable insights: For Developers: If you’re building dApps, consider deploying on Core. The Rev+ program offers a direct path to sustainable revenue based on your dApp’s usage, a significant advantage over traditional funding models. Focus on building applications that drive high user activity. For Stablecoin Issuers: Explore issuing your stablecoin on the Core network. The Rev+ model provides a direct incentive for your stablecoin’s adoption and transaction volume, offering a unique competitive edge. For DAOs: Engage actively within the Core ecosystem. Your contributions to governance, community building, and protocol development can now be directly rewarded through Rev+, providing resources for your initiatives. For Users: By transacting and interacting with dApps and stablecoins on the Core network, you are directly contributing to the economic sustainability of the ecosystem. Your activity helps reward the projects you use and value. This is a clear call to action for innovators and builders: Core Foundation is not just offering a platform, but a partnership in prosperity. The Future is Bright: A Compelling Summary of Rev+ The Core Foundation’s launch of the Rev+ revenue-sharing model marks a pivotal moment for the Core ecosystem and the broader blockchain industry. By strategically distributing gas fee revenue to stablecoin issuers, developers, and DAOs based on their contributions and user activity, Rev+ creates a powerful incentive structure for growth and sustainability. This innovative approach, built on the secure and versatile Bitcoin-based EVM-compatible Layer 1 network, positions Core as a trailblazer in fostering a truly equitable and self-sustaining decentralized economy. It’s a testament to the Core Foundation’s commitment to long-term value creation and community empowerment, promising a vibrant future for all participants.

2025-07-15T21:28:10,"House Republicans failed a key vote to advance the GENIUS Act, stalling a major crypto legislative push","House Republicans failed to advance a key procedural motion that would have enabled debate on the GENIUS Act and other major crypto bills earlier today, Tuesday. The failed vote stalled the highly anticipated legislative push dubbed part of “Crypto Week,” dealing a setback to the digital asset industry. The vote , which failed 196–222, prevented the House from beginning formal consideration of the GENIUS Act, a landmark bill aimed at establishing the first federal framework for U.S. stablecoins. The collapse of the motion also blocked debate on the annual defense spending bill and a related crypto clarity proposal. With over a dozen Republican holdouts joining Democrats to oppose the rule, House GOP leadership was left scrambling to salvage what was billed as the most ambitious crypto policy package in U.S. history. Discord within Republican ranks While the crypto industry had hoped for a seamless passage of legislation that had already cleared the Senate, internal fractures among Republicans derailed the plan. Notably, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, one of the GOP defectors, publicly criticized the GENIUS Act for lacking a provision to ban central bank digital currencies ( CBDCs ). “I just voted NO on the Rule for the GENIUS Act because it does not include a ban on Central Bank Digital Currency,” Greene wrote on X . “Americans do not want a government-controlled Central Bank Digital Currency. Republicans have a duty to ban CBDC.” I just voted NO on the Rule for the GENIUS Act because it does not include a ban on Central Bank Digital Currency and because Speaker Johnson did not allow us to submit amendments to the GENIUS Act. Americans do not want a government-controlled Central Bank Digital Currency.… pic.twitter.com/NnkeIOH0dE — Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene🇺🇸 (@RepMTG) July 15, 2025 Greene also faulted Speaker Mike Johnson for not allowing amendments to be introduced. Speaker Mike Johnson and House leadership had attempted to bundle the crypto bills with the defense appropriations bill to streamline the legislative push and avoid political infighting. Instead, the strategy backfired. While the GENIUS Act had previously cleared the Senate with bipartisan support in a 68–30 vote, House conservatives accused Johnson of denying them the chance to amend the legislation, including provisions to bar the Federal Reserve from issuing a CBDC. Some, including Rep. Greene, insisted the bill should reflect President Trump’s January executive order banning CBDCs across federal agencies. Other lawmakers, meanwhile, objected to the bundling itself, wanting each bill, especially the highly sensitive defense budget, to be considered on its own. Vote triggers market reactions News of the failed vote quickly rippled across financial markets. Shares of Circle , the issuer of the USDC stablecoin and one of the bill’s main beneficiaries, fell by nearly 5%. Coinbase and MARA Holdings each dropped by about 2%. CRCL stock price. Source: Google Finance Industry advocates, who had spent over $245 million during the 2024 election cycle to back pro-crypto candidates and policies, had framed this week as a major turning point for crypto’s future in Washington. Fairshake, the crypto sector’s leading political action committee, recently disclosed $141 million in cash reserves to continue lobbying efforts and support crypto-friendly candidates ahead of the 2026 midterms. The GENIUS Act’s passage was seen as a regulatory milestone and a potential economic boon. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent previously stated that the U.S. stablecoin market could grow to over $2 trillion if the legislation is enacted. David Sacks, the White House’s AI and crypto czar, also said the bill could unlock “trillions of dollars in new demand” for U.S. Treasuries. The House leadership is reportedly planning a second vote on the rule as early as Tuesday evening, although it’s tentative, and so far, no changes to the bill text or bundling approach have yet been confirmed. Still, there is no clear path forward. To satisfy hardliners like Greene, Johnson may be forced to reopen the legislative process and allow amendments, including a formal CBDC ban, that could jeopardize bipartisan Senate support.

According to the Financial Times , people with direct knowledge of the discussions have shared that the acquisition is planned via Cantor Equity Partners 1. It is a special‑purpose acquisition company that secured $200 million in its January IPO. Insiders have said that the negotiations are now approaching their closing stages. The discussions involve terms under which Adam Back, founder of the crypto trading firm Blockstream Capital, would help Cantor Equity Partners 1 buy over $3 billion of bitcoin. This move follows an April initiative Brandon Lutnick led alongside SoftBank and Tether, in which about $3.6 billion was invested in bitcoin. It aligns with Cantor Fitzgerald’s broader strategy of leveraging publicly listed shell vehicles to accumulate bitcoin, capitalizing on a rally in cryptocurrency valuations amid President Trump’s deregulatory push. In May, Howard Lutnick handed control of the firm over to his children. Draft deal includes 30,000 bitcoins and $800 million capital raise Under the draft agreement, Back would transfer as many as 30,000 bitcoins, valued at more than $3 billion, to Cantor Equity Partners 1. The SPAC also plans to raise up to $800 million from outside investors to fund additional purchases, potentially driving the total transaction value past $4 billion. In return for their bitcoin contribution, Back and Blockstream Capital would receive equity in the SPAC, which is slated to be renamed BSTR Holdings. Insiders indicate that as discussions wrap up, the deal could be completed within days, although terms remain under negotiation. Its timing coincides with what some lawmakers have dubbed “crypto week” as Congress considers digital‑currency legislation. Should the transaction close as anticipated, Cantor would rank among the globe’s leading purchasers of cryptocurrency. Lutnick leads Cantor’s crypto push as Back brings bitcoin legacy The effort is spearheaded by Brandon Lutnick, who took the chairmanship in February after his father’s confirmation as the administration’s chief trade representative. Combined with acquisitions through a second listed vehicle, Twenty One Capital, Cantor’s total bitcoin purchases could approach $10 billion by year‑end. Adam Back is widely recognized as one of the earliest champions of cryptocurrency technology. His 1997 introduction of the Hashcash proof‑of‑work mechanism was cited by Satoshi Nakamoto in the original Bitcoin white paper. He went on to co‑found Blockstream in 2014, a blockchain‑technology company backed by investors such as Khosla Ventures and Baillie Gifford. In the current year, Back has funded multiple enterprises building significant bitcoin treasuries. According to investors, he put €5 million into The Blockchain Group, a Paris‑listed company, during an equity raise announced this week. In June, he financed a SEK 150 million convertible bond for H100 Group, a Swedish health‑tech firm that has also added bitcoin to its balance sheet. This transaction reflects a broader movement in which SPAC structures are deployed to acquire bitcoin, as investors look to mirror Michael Saylor’s approach at MicroStrategy Ltd. Other recent players include Trump Media & Technology Group, founded by President Donald Trump, and a blank‑check enterprise led by crypto advocate Anthony Pompliano.

2025-07-15T21:03:41,"Early Bitcoiner Adam Back Nears $3.5B BTC Deal With Brandon Lutnick-Led Cantor SPAC: FT","Brandon Lutnick , chairman of Wall Street investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald, is in late-stage talks with early bitcoin proponent and Blockstream CEO Adam Back for a bitcoin treasury deal that could be worth over $3 billion, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday. According to the report, Lutnick’s blank cheque company Cantor Equity Partners 1 would acquire 30,000 BTC (nearly $3.5 billion at current prices) from Back. In return, Back would receive equity in the vehicle, which would be renamed BSTR Holdings. The firm also seeks to raise $800 million outside capital, the report said. A final deal could be announced within days, though terms are still being negotiated, per the report. The news follows Cantor Fitzgerald's previous bitcoin investment vehicle Twenty One Capital, which was backed by SoftBank, Tether and Bitfinex and headed by Jack Mallers, the CEO of bitcoin-focused payments app Strike.

2025-07-15T21:00:22,"Satoshi-Era Whale Moves 40K Bitcoin To Galaxy Digital – Major Sell-Off Coming?","After reaching a new all-time high of $123,200, Bitcoin has retraced to the $116,000 level as profit-taking and shifting market sentiment begin to take shape. While the broader trend remains bullish, a key development has caught the attention of analysts and investors alike. Top analyst Darkfost has flagged significant on-chain activity involving the so-called “80K whale”—a mysterious wallet cluster believed to be holding over 80,000 BTC from the Satoshi era. This entity recently transferred a substantial portion of its holdings to a wallet reportedly linked to Galaxy Digital, a major institutional player in the crypto space. The move is raising eyebrows, as Galaxy Digital enforces strict KYC (Know Your Customer) protocols, suggesting that the identity behind the transfer is now known to the firm. While this could indicate an intention to sell through their OTC (Over-the-Counter) brokerage desk, it’s also possible that the whale is simply reallocating funds for asset management purposes, such as earning yield on dormant BTC . 40,000 BTC Sent to Galaxy Digital As Selling Activity Sparks Volatility Darkfost has reported a significant movement in the Bitcoin network—40,000 BTC has been transferred to Galaxy Digital, one of the most prominent institutional players in the space. The transaction originated from wallet address bc1qmuxrzvnx34j8y6h9leg4zen5gnw7wmfmgp8v2p, which is now completely empty. While this transfer is notable, it’s only part of the picture. Four other wallets from the same cluster still collectively hold 40,000 BTC—none of which have moved yet. The total amount of Bitcoin sent to exchanges or OTC brokers remains uncertain for now, but Darkfost noted that selling activity appears to be ongoing. Such large-scale movements often trigger concerns in the market, and the potential for panic selling is real, especially given the scale and timing of this transfer following Bitcoin’s recent all-time high at $123,200. However, it’s important to contextualize the event within the broader market structure. Despite the short-term volatility, Bitcoin’s fundamentals remain strong. Institutional interest continues to grow, supply on exchanges remains historically low, and long-term holders show no signs of mass exit. This development may cause temporary price fluctuations, but it’s unlikely to shake the long-term conviction many investors maintain in Bitcoin’s trajectory. As always, whale activity commands attention, but it rarely defines the entire trend. BTC Drops To $116K After ATH The 12-hour chart shows Bitcoin facing a sharp pullback after reaching its all-time high at $123,200. Currently trading around $116,509, BTC has dropped nearly 6% from its peak, signaling a period of increased selling pressure. Notably, this correction was accompanied by a spike in red volume, indicating strong profit-taking activity or large sell-side orders—possibly linked to the recent whale movement toward Galaxy Digital. Despite the retrace, Bitcoin still trades well above its key moving averages: the 50 SMA ($109,353), 100 SMA ($107,729), and 200 SMA ($101,375). These levels continue to slope upward, reflecting a healthy longer-term trend. The $114,000–$117,000 zone now acts as short-term support, aligning with the last consolidation area before the breakout. Holding this range will be crucial for bulls to maintain momentum. A breakdown below could trigger a retest of the $109,300 support, a level that capped price action through much of June. On the upside, a recovery above $119K would suggest that buyers are stepping back in.

2025-07-15T21:00:21,"Ethereum Forms ‘Pure Cup And Handle’ Pattern After Hitting $3,000, Analysts Set New Targets","Ethereum’s price action in the past seven days has seen it finally touch the $3,000 resistance zone for the first time in months. This interesting move comes amid growing institutional attention caused by the massive inflows into Spot Ethereum ETFs and Bitcoin’s recent climb to new all-time highs. Ethereum has gained over 17% in the past seven days alone, reaching a new local high of $3,065. Interestingly, bullish technical structures are starting to emerge that could send the ETH price soaring toward new all-time highs. Two analysts have now spotted classic bullish setups, both hinting at a significant rally on the horizon. Cup And Handle Pattern Points To $4,200 If Breakout Holds The first analyst, known as @CryptosBatman on the social media platform X, shared a daily candlestick chart of Ethereum, where a pure ‘cup and handle’ pattern is visible over the past four months. The pattern, which started in early March, shows a rounded bottom that dipped to as low as $1,400, followed by a minor consolidation that formed the handle portion. Now, recent price action has caused ETH to break out of the neckline around $2,850. A technical projection from this neckline points to a 45% move to a price target just below $4,200. Related Reading: Ethereum Is Already Outperforming Bitcoin In July, Is Altcoin Season Here? According to this analyst, Ethereum’s breakout from the cup and handle pattern has formed in the middle of powerful fundamentals. Ethereum is now beginning to outperform Bitcoin in terms of short-term returns, and exchange reserves have dropped to an eight-year low. These are both fundamental signals of strong holding behavior and reduced sell-side pressure. With these metrics aligning with the technical breakout, @CryptosBatman believes Ethereum could be next in line to break its all-time high, possibly before the end of Q3. Weekly Chart Echoes Previous 42% Rally Another crypto market technician, CryptoBullet, expressed a similar sentiment on the social media platform X. This analyst referenced Ethereum’s weekly candlestick chart to support his outlook. He pointed to the formation of last week’s massive green breakout candle that has pushed the price above a major supply-resistance zone around $2,850. This move, as shown in the chart below, mirrors the same structure that caused a 42% rally between February and March 2024, when ETH moved from the $2,900 level up to nearly $4,100 within a matter of weeks. Related Reading: Ethereum To Outperform Bitcoin: Buy Before Mid-August, Analyst Warns If that price action is replicated in this current setup, Ethereum could again be on track to test $4,200 in the next three to four weeks. This puts the timeline of a $4,200 price target sometime in August 2025. The projection is shown with the vertical price range box drawn in the chart above, which maps a 42% upside from the breakout zone. Interestingly, this projection relies on the $2,800 price level, which previously acted as resistance, now flipping to support and preventing any sustained retracements below the $2,900 to $2,850 range. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,980, having reached an intraday high of $3,074.

2025-07-15T21:00:09,"Tether Analog USDT0 Goes Live on Bitcoin Layer 2 Rootstock","USDT0, a cross-chain version of the popular stablecoin USDT, has been launched on Rootstock, a Layer 2 network built on top of the Bitcoin network. This new launch will enable users to transfer stablecoins between blockchains easily. At the same time, it aims to enhance the utilization of digital money in Bitcoin-based decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. USDT0 Launches on Rootstock to Power Bitcoin-Based DeFi USDT0 is a version of the USDT stablecoin that can work across many blockchains. USDT is fully backed on the Ethereum network. However, it is not run by Tether itself. A company called Everdawn Labs manages USDT0. According to the team behind the project, the goal of USDT0 is to reduce the cost and difficulty of using stablecoins on different blockchains. USDT0 enables people to send and use digital dollars faster and at lower fees. This makes it easier for developers and users to utilize stablecoins across various blockchain applications without requiring manual fund transfers between networks. With USDT0 now available on Rootstock, people can use stablecoins directly in apps built on the Bitcoin blockchain. This is important because Rootstock allows developers to create applications similar to those on Ethereum. At the same time, it uses Bitcoin’s secure and reliable network for protection. The USDT0 team believes now is the right time to support the growing number of apps being built on Bitcoin. This is happening as more people show interest in using the Bitcoin network for more than just holding the digital currency. As more developers look to build on Bitcoin, having easy access to stablecoins like USDT0 will make the process smoother. USDT0 Expands Its Reach with Rootstock Integration Rootstock was created in 2018. It is designed to bring smart contract features to the Bitcoin ecosystem . It enables developers to create apps while leveraging the network’s strong security. Rootstock combines the flexible tools found in Ethereum with Bitcoin’s proven and decentralized system. Before coming to Rootstock, USDT0 was already launched on Ethereum, Arbitrum, Unichain, and the OP Superchain. Adding Rootstock to this list helps connect the Bitcoin network to the broader stablecoin ecosystem. Now, users and businesses on Rootstock can utilize one of the most widely trusted stablecoins without needing to leave the Bitcoin ecosystem. USDT’s Reach Continues to Expand Tether’s USDT is the largest and most used stablecoin in the world. The US dollar backs it, and it is mainly run on Ethereum, but versions of it exist on many blockchains. The total amount of USDT in circulation exceeds $160 billion. The launch of USDT0 on Rootstock helps bring this stablecoin into new spaces. It connects the stablecoin to Bitcoin-based finance, allowing money to move more freely across blockchain systems. This is a crucial step as digital finance continues to expand across various networks.

2025-07-15T20:50:48,"BTC Digital’s Audacious $6M Raise: Fueling Future with Ethereum","BitcoinWorld BTC Digital’s Audacious $6M Raise: Fueling Future with Ethereum In a significant move that underscores the burgeoning institutional interest in digital assets, Nasdaq-listed BTC Digital (BTCT), a prominent blockchain firm , has announced its ambitious plans to raise $6 million. This substantial capital injection, earmarked specifically for the purchase of Ethereum (ETH), signals a clear strategic pivot towards expanding its digital asset portfolio. According to a recent PR Newswire press release, the company intends to execute this through a direct stock offering, selling 2 million shares at $3 each to institutional investors. Why is BTC Digital Making This Bold Crypto Investment? The decision by BTC Digital to raise capital specifically for an Ethereum purchase is a powerful statement in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. While Bitcoin often dominates headlines, Ethereum, as the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and countless dApps, presents a unique value proposition. This strategic allocation of funds suggests a deeper understanding of the diverse opportunities within the crypto ecosystem beyond just Bitcoin. Diversification: Investing in Ethereum allows BTC Digital to diversify its digital asset holdings, reducing reliance on a single cryptocurrency. Ecosystem Growth: Ethereum’s robust ecosystem, with its ongoing development (e.g., The Merge, Shanghai upgrade, future sharding), offers significant growth potential. Utility Value: Unlike Bitcoin’s primary role as a store of value, Ethereum boasts immense utility as a programmable blockchain, driving innovation across various sectors. Staking Opportunities: With Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake, the potential for staking rewards could offer a new revenue stream for the blockchain firm. Unpacking the $6 Million Digital Asset Acquisition Strategy The mechanics of this digital asset acquisition are straightforward yet impactful. By offering 2 million shares at $3 each, BTC Digital is directly engaging institutional investors. This method bypasses traditional public offerings, often streamlining the fundraising process and targeting entities already familiar with or interested in the blockchain and crypto space. For institutional investors, participating in such an offering can be appealing for several reasons: Direct Exposure: It offers direct exposure to the performance of Ethereum without the complexities of direct crypto custody. Regulated Entity: Investing through a Nasdaq-listed blockchain firm provides a layer of regulatory oversight and transparency not always present in direct crypto investments. Growth Potential: If Ethereum performs well, these institutional investors stand to benefit from the appreciation of their BTCT shares. This move highlights a growing trend where traditional financial mechanisms are being adapted to facilitate mainstream participation in the crypto market, signaling maturity and broader acceptance. The Broader Trend: Institutional Crypto Investment on the Rise BTC Digital ‘s latest announcement is not an isolated incident but rather a clear indicator of a larger trend: the increasing appetite for crypto investment among institutional players. Over the past few years, we’ve witnessed a significant shift from retail-dominated crypto markets to those with substantial institutional participation. Pension funds, hedge funds, corporate treasuries, and asset managers are increasingly allocating portions of their portfolios to digital assets. Several factors are driving this surge: Inflation Hedging: Cryptocurrencies are often seen as a hedge against inflation, particularly Bitcoin. Diversification: Digital assets offer low correlation with traditional asset classes, providing diversification benefits. Technological Innovation: The underlying blockchain technology is recognized for its transformative potential across industries. Improved Infrastructure: The development of regulated custody solutions, derivatives, and investment vehicles has made it safer and easier for institutions to enter the market. This institutional embrace is crucial for the long-term stability and growth of the crypto market, lending it legitimacy and deeper liquidity. What Does This Mean for the Future of Ethereum and BTC Digital? The influx of capital specifically targeted at Ethereum by a publicly traded blockchain firm like BTC Digital could have several ripple effects. For Ethereum, it reinforces its position as a leading smart contract platform and a preferred institutional asset. Increased institutional holdings could contribute to greater price stability and reduced volatility in the long run. For BTC Digital , this strategic move positions them to capitalize on Ethereum’s growth trajectory. Should ETH’s value appreciate, the company’s asset base will grow, potentially boosting its stock price and overall market valuation. However, it’s also important to acknowledge the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrency investments, including market volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and technological risks. Navigating the Challenges of Digital Asset Acquisition While the prospects of this digital asset acquisition are exciting, BTC Digital , like any entity venturing deeper into the crypto space, faces a unique set of challenges: Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile. Price swings can significantly impact the value of their Ethereum holdings. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for digital assets is still evolving globally, posing compliance and operational challenges. Security Risks: Holding large amounts of cryptocurrency necessitates robust security measures to prevent hacks or loss of assets. Competition: The institutional crypto investment space is becoming increasingly crowded, with more traditional financial firms entering the fray. Successfully navigating these challenges will be crucial for BTC Digital to realize the full potential of its strategic Ethereum purchase. Conclusion: A Strategic Bet on the Digital Future BTC Digital ‘s plan to raise $6 million for an Ethereum purchase through a direct stock offering is a compelling story of a blockchain firm making a calculated bet on the future of digital assets. This move not only highlights the growing maturity of the cryptocurrency market but also underscores Ethereum’s increasing importance as a foundational layer for the decentralized web. As institutional crypto investment continues to gain momentum, companies like BTC Digital are at the forefront, bridging traditional finance with the innovative world of blockchain. Their strategic digital asset acquisition could serve as a blueprint for others looking to integrate cryptocurrencies into their core business models, marking another significant step towards mainstream adoption.

2025-07-15T20:45:26,"Fidelity becomes the biggest shareholder in Japan-based Bitcoin treasury company Metaplanet","Popular investment firm Fidelity has become the largest shareholder of Japan-based Bitcoin treasury company Metaplanet. The company CEO, Simon Gerovich, disclosed this today on X, noting that the firm owns 12.9% of its shares. According to Gerovich , a limited liability company known as National Financial Services (NFS) LLC is the biggest shareholder in Metaplanet as of June 30. The company holds 130 billion Yen (approximately $820 million) shares. Interestingly, NFS is a subsidiary fully owned by Fidelity Investments and serves as custodian for shares bought through the Fidelity platform. Gerovich explained: “NFS is a wholly owned subsidiary of Fidelity Investments and typically acts as custodian for retail and institutional investors who purchase shares via Fidelity platforms.” Based on Gerovich’s explanation, Fidelity through NFS holds most of the shares in custody for customers who buy Metaplanet shares through the platform. While the Bitcoin treasury company is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Fidelity is one of the brokerage firms with Metaplanet stock available for its customers earlier this year. Gerovich acknowledged this is a positive sign for the company, noting that its shareholder base continues to expand with its stock becoming globally accessible. Interestingly, Fidelity, being the largest shareholder of Metaplanet, is similar to how Vanguard is also the largest holder of the Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) shares through its funds. However, unlike Vanguard, which refuses to allow Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) trading on its platform, Fidelity not only lists Bitcoin ETFs but also has its own spot Bitcoin ETF (FBTC). In both cases, the firms’ exposure to the Bitcoin treasury companies is due to their customers, showing substantial interest in these companies from retail and institutional investors who trade and invest through the TradFi brokerage and investment firms. Metaplanet solidifies position as a top-five corporate holder of BTC Meanwhile, the recent development represents a positive sign for Metaplanet as the company continues down the path towards accumulating more BTC. It recently acquired 797 BTC for $93.6 million, putting the average price $117,451 for each BTC. With that move, its Bitcoin holdings increased to 16,352 BTC bought for $1.64 billion. While this pales in comparison to the over 600,000 BTC that Strategy holds, Metaplanet has quietly climbed up in the rankings of public corporate holders of BTC over the past few months and now sits at number five. Metaplanet’s new target is now to have 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027, and the company has said it would use its Bitcoin holdings as collateral to secure capital for investing in other cash-generating businesses. Metaplanet stock sees decline amidst Bitcoin profit taking Despite the positive news of growing adoption for Metaplanet, the company’s stock has sharply declined today, falling almost 8% in the past 24 hours to 1,436 Yen. The decline marks a month-long performance that has seen it fall 24.22% in value. Nevertheless, the stock is up 301% year to date, highlighting its overwhelming performance compared to several other Bitcoin treasury stocks. MSTR has only gained 53% while MARA is up 12.49%. Even BTC value has only increased by 23.69% in 2025 Metaplanet stock performance YTD (Source: Google Finance) However, Metaplanet’s recent decline in value is due to the profit taking that has caused BTC value to drop almost 4% in the past 24 hours, sliding to $116,000. With the flagship assets hitting a new ATH, several traders are already taking profit. In one instance, a long-time BTC holder moved 40,000 BTC to Galaxy Digital in what is likely a massive selloff after being inactive for 14 years. This potential sale of over $4 billion worth of BTC was enough to spook the market, with other tokens also falling in value. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Additionally, the 30-day percentage change metric has shifted from the “accumulation” phase to the “selling” phase. This development is being interpreted as an early signal that investors are beginning to take profits. “For long-term investors, the sudden drop in the supply ratio and the reversal of the 30-day change to distribution suggest profit-taking has begun.

2025-07-15T20:40:47,"Bitcoin fell to $115,222 after three major crypto bills backed by Trump were blocked in the House","Bitcoin nosedived to $115,222 on Tuesday, dropping 4% in just minutes, after three key crypto bills tied to Donald Trump were blocked in the House of Representatives. The bills collapsed during a procedural vote that saw 13 Republicans break ranks and join Democrats to stop the motion, resulting in a 196-223 defeat. This triggered an instant sell-off across the market, with Ethereum down 1%, XRP down 1%, and Solana falling 2%. The failed rule vote means the legislation, which needed House approval to move forward, is dead in the water… at least for now. The crash wiped away optimism that had been building for weeks. Bitcoin had been making back-to-back all-time highs recently, driven by heavy institutional buying of Bitcoin ETFs and the assumption that Congress was finally ready to play ball with the industry. Meanwhile, traders pulled profits. Data from CryptoQuant shows Bitcoin holders took $3.5 billion off the table in the past day. Over 56% of those were long-term wallet cashing out. Trump’s House loses 13 Republicans in surprise vote Anyway, this was supposed to be the week crypto got clarity from Washington. But instead, Donald Trump’s own party fractured. House Republicans had lined up three bills; one to regulate stablecoins, one to sort out the mess between the SEC and CFTC, and one to block the Federal Reserve from creating a central bank digital currency. But it all fell apart when 13 GOP members voted no. The first bill, the GENIUS Act , had already cleared the Senate last month and had some Democratic backing. It aimed to create a national framework for stablecoins. The second, called the CLARITY Act, would’ve decided if crypto assets fall under Gary Gensler’s SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The third proposal sought to permanently ban the Fed from launching any government-backed digital currency. All three are now stalled. The chaos hammered stocks, too. Riot Platforms dropped 3.3%, Mara Holdings fell 2.3%, and Coinbase slipped 1.5%. All three continued sinking in extended trading.

2025-07-15T20:40:03,"Solana ETF: ProShares Unveils Revolutionary Ultra SLON for Crypto Investors","BitcoinWorld Solana ETF: ProShares Unveils Revolutionary Ultra SLON for Crypto Investors The world of cryptocurrency investment just got a thrilling new option! Global asset management firm ProShares , a name synonymous with innovation in the ETF space, has launched the ProShares Ultra Solana ETF (SLON). This isn’t just any ordinary fund; it’s designed to deliver 2x the daily performance of Solana, opening up a dynamic new avenue for those looking to amplify their exposure to this popular digital asset. This move, reported by StreetInsider, marks a significant milestone in the evolving landscape of digital asset investment . What Does the ProShares Ultra Solana ETF Mean for You? For many crypto enthusiasts and traditional investors alike, the introduction of a Solana ETF , especially one with leveraged exposure, is a game-changer. Historically, gaining direct exposure to cryptocurrencies often involved navigating complex exchanges, self-custody, or less regulated platforms. ETFs bridge this gap, offering a regulated and familiar investment vehicle through traditional brokerage accounts. Here’s what the ProShares Ultra Solana ETF (SLON) brings to the table: Amplified Performance: The primary appeal of SLON is its 2x daily performance target. This means if Solana gains 5% in a day, the SLON ETF aims to gain 10% (before fees and expenses). This can be incredibly attractive for aggressive traders looking to capitalize on Solana’s well-known volatility. Accessibility: Investors can now gain leveraged exposure to Solana through their standard brokerage accounts, making it as accessible as buying stocks or other traditional ETFs. Liquidity: As an ETF, SLON trades on major exchanges, offering the liquidity and transparency that many institutional and retail investors prefer over direct crypto purchases. Why ProShares is a Key Player in the Crypto ETF Space ProShares isn’t new to the cryptocurrency scene. They were pioneers, launching the first Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) in the U.S. in October 2021, which quickly became one of the most successful ETF launches ever. Their track record demonstrates a clear understanding of the digital asset market and the regulatory landscape. Their continued foray into crypto-linked products, now with Solana, underscores a growing institutional confidence in the long-term viability of cryptocurrencies. ProShares’ expertise in structured products and leveraged funds positions them uniquely to offer sophisticated investment tools that cater to diverse investor appetites, from those seeking conservative exposure to those pursuing aggressive, short-term gains. Understanding the Mechanics of the SLON ETF : 2x Performance The SLON ETF is designed to provide 2x the daily performance of Solana. This is achieved through the use of financial derivatives, such as futures contracts or swaps, rather than holding Solana directly. While this mechanism offers amplified returns, it’s crucial to understand how leveraged ETFs work. Key Considerations for Leveraged ETFs: Feature Description Daily Reset Leveraged ETFs like SLON reset their leverage daily. This means their performance over periods longer than one day can significantly deviate from the stated multiple of the underlying asset’s performance. Compounding Effect Due to daily resetting, compounding can lead to unexpected results, especially in volatile or sideways markets. Small daily gains or losses are compounded, which can erode returns over time. Volatility Decay In highly volatile markets, even if the underlying asset’s price returns to its starting point, a leveraged ETF might show a loss. This is known as volatility decay and is a critical risk for long-term holders. This structure makes leveraged ETFs generally unsuitable for long-term holding. They are primarily designed for short-term trading strategies where investors aim to capitalize on immediate price movements. The Double-Edged Sword: Is a Leveraged Crypto ETF Right for Your Portfolio? A Leveraged Crypto ETF like SLON offers undeniable potential for significant gains, but it comes with equally significant risks. It’s not a ‘set it and forget it’ investment. Investors considering SLON should have a robust understanding of both Solana’s market dynamics and the intricacies of leveraged products. Benefits: Enhanced Returns: For those with a high conviction in Solana’s short-term upward movement, SLON can magnify profits. No Direct Crypto Custody: Eliminates the complexities and security risks associated with holding actual Solana tokens. Short-Term Trading Tool: Excellent for active traders looking to express short-term directional views on Solana. Challenges & Risks: Magnified Losses: Just as gains are amplified, so are losses. A 5% drop in Solana could lead to a 10% drop in SLON. Volatility Decay: As mentioned, extended periods of high volatility can erode returns even if the underlying asset remains flat or recovers. Not for Long-Term: The daily reset mechanism makes these funds generally unsuitable for buy-and-hold strategies. Market Risk: The overall crypto market is inherently volatile and subject to rapid price swings due to regulatory news, technological developments, and broader economic factors. Navigating the Future of Digital Asset Investment with SLON The launch of the ProShares Ultra Solana ETF (SLON) is a clear indicator of the maturing digital asset investment landscape. As more regulated products become available, the barrier to entry for traditional investors into the crypto space continues to lower. However, with greater accessibility comes the responsibility of thorough due diligence. For those considering SLON or any leveraged crypto product, here are some actionable insights: Educate Yourself: Understand the mechanics of leveraged ETFs, including daily resets and volatility decay. Define Your Strategy: Determine if your investment horizon and risk tolerance align with a short-term, high-risk product. Start Small: If you’re new to leveraged products, consider allocating a very small portion of your portfolio to gain experience. Monitor Closely: Leveraged ETFs require active monitoring due to their daily reset nature and the inherent volatility of the underlying asset. Consult a Financial Advisor: Especially for complex products, professional advice can be invaluable. The ProShares Ultra Solana ETF offers an exciting, albeit high-risk, opportunity for investors seeking amplified exposure to Solana. It represents another step forward in the mainstream adoption of digital assets, providing sophisticated tools for a new generation of investors. As the crypto market continues to evolve, expect to see more innovative products emerge, each demanding a thoughtful and informed approach from market participants.

The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with exhilarating news: Bitcoin price has achieved another remarkable milestone, soaring above the $118,000 mark! According to real-time market monitoring from Bitcoin World, BTC is currently trading at an impressive $118,000 on the Binance USDT market. This latest ascent is not just a number; it represents a significant moment for investors, enthusiasts, and the broader financial landscape. What does this incredible surge mean for the future of digital assets, and what factors are propelling the world’s leading cryptocurrency to such unprecedented heights? The Unstoppable BTC Surge : What’s Driving the Momentum? Bitcoin’s journey to $118,000 is a testament to its growing maturity and increasing acceptance in mainstream finance. This isn’t a random spike; it’s the culmination of several powerful forces converging to create a robust bullish trend. Understanding these drivers is crucial for anyone looking to navigate the volatile yet rewarding waters of the crypto space. Key Drivers Behind Bitcoin’s Ascent: Institutional Adoption: Large financial institutions, hedge funds, and corporations are increasingly allocating portions of their portfolios to Bitcoin. This ‘smart money’ inflow brings significant capital and legitimacy to the asset class. Companies are holding BTC on their balance sheets, and investment funds are creating products that offer traditional investors exposure to crypto without directly owning the asset. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic uncertainties, rising inflation concerns, and unprecedented quantitative easing by central banks have driven investors to seek out alternative stores of value. Bitcoin, often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ offers a decentralized and finite supply, making it an attractive hedge against traditional fiat currency devaluation. Halving Narrative: The Bitcoin halving events, which occur approximately every four years, cut the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market by half. Historically, these events have preceded significant bull runs due to the fundamental principle of reduced supply meeting sustained or increasing demand. The anticipation and post-halving effects often create a strong upward price pressure. Spot ETF Approvals: The approval of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in major markets has opened the floodgates for a wider range of investors, including those who prefer regulated investment vehicles accessible through traditional brokerage accounts. This has significantly broadened Bitcoin’s accessibility and liquidity, driving demand. Growing Retail Interest: While institutional money is impactful, a renewed wave of retail interest, fueled by positive news and social media buzz, also contributes to buying pressure. Platforms making it easier to buy and sell Bitcoin further lower the barrier to entry for individual investors. The interplay of these factors creates a powerful feedback loop, where each positive development reinforces the others, propelling the BTC surge higher. The current trading volume and market sentiment suggest a strong conviction among holders and new entrants alike that Bitcoin’s value proposition is solid and its growth trajectory remains intact. Navigating the Crypto Market : Opportunities and Challenges As Bitcoin pushes past new thresholds like $118,000, the entire crypto market experiences a ripple effect. Altcoins often follow Bitcoin’s lead, albeit with higher volatility. For investors, this presents both immense opportunities for wealth creation and significant challenges that demand careful consideration and strategic planning. Opportunities in a Bullish Market: Capital Appreciation: The most obvious opportunity is the potential for significant gains as asset prices rise. Early investors in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have seen life-changing returns. Innovation and Ecosystem Growth: A strong Bitcoin market often signals a healthy broader crypto ecosystem. This encourages innovation in decentralized finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), Web3, and other blockchain-based technologies, creating new investment avenues. Increased Liquidity: Higher prices and increased trading activity lead to greater market liquidity, making it easier for investors to enter and exit positions without significant price slippage. Mainstream Acceptance: As crypto assets gain value, they become harder for traditional finance to ignore, leading to more services, products, and regulatory clarity, which further strengthens the market. Challenges and Risks to Consider: Despite the excitement, the crypto market is inherently volatile, and a BTC surge can be followed by corrections. Prudent investors must be aware of the risks: Challenge Description Volatility Cryptocurrency prices can experience rapid and dramatic fluctuations in short periods, leading to substantial gains or losses. Regulatory Uncertainty The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, and new laws or bans in various jurisdictions can impact market sentiment and price. Market Manipulation Despite increasing maturity, the crypto market can still be susceptible to ‘pump and dump’ schemes or large whale movements that can artificially inflate or depress prices. Security Risks While blockchain technology is secure, individual investors face risks from exchange hacks, phishing scams, or losing private keys to their wallets. A balanced approach, combining excitement with caution, is key to navigating the dynamic crypto market successfully. Never invest more than you can afford to lose, and always conduct thorough research. Decoding the Significance of Bitcoin $118,000 : A New Era? Reaching $118,000 is more than just another number on a chart; it carries significant psychological and economic weight for the entire crypto ecosystem. It signals a shift in perception and potentially ushers in a new era for digital assets. But why is this specific price point so important? The Psychology of Price Milestones: Round numbers and significant thresholds often act as psychological barriers or support levels. Breaking past $100,000 was a massive hurdle, and now pushing towards $120,000 solidifies Bitcoin’s position in a higher valuation bracket. Each new all-time high or significant price level reinforces investor confidence and attracts new capital, creating a positive feedback loop. Bitcoin’s Evolution as a Global Asset: At $118,000, Bitcoin’s market capitalization becomes even more substantial, placing it firmly among the world’s most valuable assets. This increasing market cap makes it harder to manipulate and more attractive to large-scale investors who require deep liquidity. It also strengthens its narrative as a legitimate global reserve asset and a viable alternative to traditional financial instruments. Consider the journey Bitcoin has taken: from a niche digital experiment to a financial behemoth. Each milestone, including the current Bitcoin $118,000 valuation, represents a step further away from its speculative past and closer to its potential as a foundational layer of a new global financial system. This ongoing evolution is what keeps both long-term HODLers and new entrants captivated. The Role of Binance USDT and Market Liquidity The fact that Bitcoin is trading at $118,000 on the Binance USDT market is a crucial detail. Binance is one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges by trading volume, and USDT (Tether) is the most widely used stablecoin, pegged to the US dollar. This combination plays a vital role in Bitcoin’s price discovery and overall market health. Why Binance and USDT Matter: Liquidity Hub: Binance serves as a massive liquidity hub, meaning there’s a constant flow of buyers and sellers, allowing for efficient price discovery and minimizing slippage on large trades. High liquidity is essential for a healthy market. Global Reach: Binance’s global user base ensures that Bitcoin’s price reflects a broad spectrum of demand from various regions, not just isolated markets. USDT as a Trading Pair: Trading against USDT offers stability. Investors can quickly move in and out of Bitcoin without converting to fiat currency, making transactions faster and often cheaper. USDT’s widespread acceptance across exchanges makes it a de facto reserve currency within the crypto space. Market Sentiment Indicator: High trading volume on the Binance USDT pair for Bitcoin often indicates strong market interest and momentum. It’s a key metric for traders and analysts to gauge the strength of a trend. The reliability and depth of the Binance USDT market contribute significantly to Bitcoin’s ability to sustain such high valuations. It provides the necessary infrastructure for seamless trading, allowing for efficient capital allocation and price stability even amidst significant price movements. Actionable Insights for Investors: Capitalizing on the Bitcoin Boom With Bitcoin price reaching new heights, many investors might be wondering how to best position themselves. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or new to the space, a well-thought-out strategy is essential to capitalize on the boom while mitigating risks. Strategies for the Current Market: Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, DCA involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals (e.g., weekly or monthly), regardless of the price. This strategy helps reduce the impact of volatility and can lead to a lower average purchase price over time. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Diversify your portfolio beyond just Bitcoin, considering other promising cryptocurrencies or traditional assets. Set stop-loss orders to limit potential losses, and take profits strategically to secure gains. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Define your investment horizon. If you’re a long-term investor, focus on Bitcoin’s fundamental value and ignore short-term price fluctuations. Traders, on the other hand, will look for entry and exit points based on technical analysis. Stay Informed: The crypto market moves quickly. Keep up with news, regulatory developments, and technological advancements. Follow reputable sources and avoid making decisions based on hype or fear. Secure Your Assets: If you hold significant amounts of Bitcoin, consider moving them from exchange wallets to hardware wallets (cold storage) for enhanced security. Understanding these actionable insights can empower you to make more informed decisions and potentially benefit from Bitcoin’s continued growth, rather than being swept away by market emotions. What’s Next for Bitcoin? Predictions and Long-Term Vision The ascent of Bitcoin $118,000 naturally leads to the question: what’s next? While no one can predict the future with certainty, several factors suggest continued positive momentum for Bitcoin and the broader crypto space. Future Outlook and Potential Trajectories: Continued Institutional Inflow: As more regulated products become available and major financial players integrate crypto into their offerings, institutional capital is likely to continue flowing into Bitcoin. Technological Advancements: Improvements to Bitcoin’s underlying technology, such as the Lightning Network for faster and cheaper transactions, will enhance its utility and scalability, driving further adoption. Global Adoption: More countries and businesses are exploring or adopting Bitcoin and blockchain technology, increasing its utility as a medium of exchange and a store of value worldwide. Supply Shock: With each halving event, the rate of new Bitcoin entering circulation decreases, while demand potentially increases, creating a supply shock that could drive prices higher over the long term. Many analysts predict that Bitcoin is still in the early stages of its adoption curve and has significant room for growth. The long-term vision for Bitcoin sees it evolving into a truly global, decentralized financial backbone, offering an alternative to traditional banking systems and a hedge against economic instability. The journey to $118,000 is a thrilling chapter in Bitcoin’s story, but it’s likely just one of many monumental leaps yet to come. Its resilience, growing acceptance, and unique value proposition continue to solidify its position as a transformative force in the financial world. The surge of Bitcoin price above $118,000 is a powerful reminder of the cryptocurrency’s enduring strength and growing influence. Fueled by institutional adoption, macroeconomic tailwinds, and robust trading on platforms like Binance USDT , Bitcoin continues to redefine financial paradigms. While the crypto market remains volatile, this significant milestone underscores Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value and a transformative technology. For investors, understanding the drivers, opportunities, and risks is paramount to navigating this exciting new era. As Bitcoin continues its ascent, it paves the way for a more decentralized and innovative financial future.

2025-07-15T20:26:41,"US Lawmaker Warns More FTX-Style Crashes Coming Without Crypto CLARITY","Impending crypto legislation, such as the CLARITY Act, could prevent another massive crypto collapse, according to lawmakers. The US House Rules Committee met on Monday to discuss three crypto bills, including the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act, which was introduced at the end of June with the aim of providing a clear regulatory framework for the crypto industry. Republican representative French Hill said that without these regulations, another FTX-type collapse could occur. “If the existing ad hoc process remains in place, I’m convinced we’ll continue to see future FTX-like situations because consumers are not afforded the careful protections included in this legislation.” WATCH: Chairman @RepFrenchHill speaks at @RulesReps on the three bills as part of “Crypto Week:” CLARITY Act GENIUS Act Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act pic.twitter.com/VoHiAoaUt1 — Financial Services GOP (@FinancialCmte) July 14, 2025 Another FTX Looms Without Regulations Hill emphasized that the bill imposes strict consumer and market protections, including a prohibition on co-mingling customer funds. This directly addresses one of FTX’s major failures, where customer deposits were illegally used for other purposes. There are also capital requirements that ensure firms maintain adequate reserves, record-keeping obligations creating audit trails and transparency, and conflict of interest provisions preventing self-dealing that contributed to FTX’s downfall. Hill argued that the current system has gaps that leave consumers unprotected. “For too long, America’s digital assets regime has been delivered in the worst possible world: regulation by enforcement that stifles responsible innovation and an existing commodity and security regulatory framework that’s plagued by gaps that leave consumers unprotected and investors confused.” Rather than the current regulation by enforcement approach, the bill provides clear definitions of digital commodities and assets, specific disclosure requirements for fundraising, and retail investor protections through “carefully calibrated resale limitations.” It also gives authority and oversight of centralized exchanges to the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission. “We are not creating loopholes. We are closing regulatory gaps,” he said. On Tuesday, July 15, policymakers will begin discussing the bills, and voting will start when the debate ends. Two More Crypto Bills in Spotlight In addition to the CLARITY Act, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins ( GENIUS ) Act will also be debated and voted on. This legislation provides a regulatory framework for stablecoins, setting rules for issuers, reserve transparency, and allowing banks to participate. The House votes on my GENIUS Act this week. With this bill, we are one step closer to becoming the global leader in crypto. Let’s get this to @POTUS ’s desk ASAP. — Senator Bill Hagerty (@SenatorHagerty) July 14, 2025 The Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, which aims to prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency, is also up for debate and a vote this week. On July 22, Donald Trump’s Digital Asset Task Force is expected to release a report that could include an American strategic Bitcoin reserve, which could also boost crypto market sentiment.

2025-07-15T20:20:09,"OFA Group Unleashes Massive $100M Crypto Investment Wave","BitcoinWorld OFA Group Unleashes Massive $100M Crypto Investment Wave In a bold move signaling growing confidence in the digital asset space, Nasdaq-listed OFA Group (OFAL) has announced a monumental commitment to the cryptocurrency market. This isn’t just another small dip into digital assets; we’re talking about a significant financial pledge that could reshape perceptions and pave the way for more traditional entities to embrace the future of finance. What does this mean for the crypto landscape, and why are OFA Group’s choices of Bitcoin, Solana, and Sui so intriguing? Who is OFA Group and What Does This Crypto Investment Mean? OFA Group (OFAL), a company listed on the Nasdaq exchange, has made headlines with its recent announcement. According to a Globe Newswire press release, the firm has entered into a committed equity purchase agreement with Atsion Opportunity Fund LLC. This agreement is set to provide OFA Group with up to $100 million to specifically fund the purchase of cryptocurrencies. This initial commitment also comes with an exciting option to expand to $200 million upon mutual consent, indicating a long-term strategic vision for their digital asset portfolio. This isn’t just about buying some tokens; it’s about a publicly traded company allocating substantial capital to what was once considered a niche or speculative asset class. It speaks volumes about the maturation of the cryptocurrency market and the increasing comfort level of institutional players. For OFA Group, this investment could be a strategic diversification, a hedge against inflation, or a move to capitalize on the high-growth potential of the digital economy. Why Bitcoin (BTC) Remains a Cornerstone of Institutional Portfolios? When institutions like OFA Group decide to dive into crypto, Bitcoin (BTC) is almost always at the top of their list. Why? Because Bitcoin has firmly established itself as the undisputed king of cryptocurrencies and a legitimate store of value, often dubbed ‘digital gold’. Its limited supply, decentralized nature, and robust network security make it an attractive asset for long-term holding and capital preservation. Scarcity and Digital Gold Narrative: With a capped supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin’s scarcity mimics that of precious metals, making it an appealing hedge against traditional financial market uncertainties and inflation. First-Mover Advantage and Brand Recognition: Bitcoin has the longest track record and the highest brand recognition in the crypto space, making it the most liquid and widely accepted cryptocurrency. Institutional Infrastructure: The recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has created regulated and accessible avenues for institutional investors to gain exposure to BTC without directly holding the asset, further legitimizing its status. Network Security: Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism ensures an incredibly secure and resilient network, making it highly resistant to attacks. For OFA Group, investing in Bitcoin provides a stable foundation for their crypto portfolio, offering exposure to the most mature and widely accepted digital asset. What Makes Solana (SOL) an Attractive Bet for Institutional Crypto Investment? Beyond Bitcoin, OFA Group’s decision to include Solana (SOL) in their investment strategy highlights a keen eye for high-performance blockchain ecosystems. Solana has emerged as a formidable competitor in the Layer-1 blockchain space, known for its incredible speed and low transaction costs. These attributes make it particularly appealing for applications requiring high throughput, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and gaming. Blazing Fast Transactions: Solana boasts the ability to process thousands of transactions per second (TPS), significantly outperforming many other blockchains. This speed is crucial for real-time applications. Low Fees: The cost of transacting on Solana is remarkably low, making it accessible for a wide range of users and applications. Thriving Ecosystem: Despite past challenges, Solana’s ecosystem has shown remarkable resilience and growth, attracting a large developer community and a diverse array of projects in DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 gaming. Scalability Solutions: Solana’s unique architecture, including Proof-of-History (PoH) combined with Proof-of-Stake (PoS), allows for significant scalability without compromising decentralization. OFA Group’s investment in Solana suggests a belief in the future of scalable, high-performance blockchain technology that can support mainstream adoption of decentralized applications. Is Sui (SUI) the Next Big Thing in Institutional Crypto Adoption? Perhaps the most intriguing choice in OFA Group’s portfolio is Sui (SUI). As a relatively newer Layer-1 blockchain, Sui represents a forward-looking investment, signaling confidence in emerging technologies with significant growth potential. Sui is built on the Move programming language, originally developed by Meta (formerly Facebook) for its Diem blockchain project, and features a unique object-centric data model and parallel execution capabilities. Innovative Technology: Sui’s architecture allows for parallel execution of transactions, meaning multiple transactions can be processed simultaneously, leading to incredibly high throughput and low latency. This is a game-changer for applications requiring massive scalability. Move Language: The use of Move, a Rust-based programming language designed for secure and verifiable smart contracts, offers enhanced security features and developer-friendliness. Object-Centric Model: Unlike account-centric blockchains, Sui’s object-centric model simplifies complex transactions and enables more expressive and efficient smart contract development, particularly for gaming and social applications. Strong Backing and Vision: Developed by Mysten Labs, a team with deep roots in blockchain research from Meta, Sui has attracted significant venture capital funding and is positioned as a strong contender in the next generation of Layer-1s. Including Sui demonstrates that OFA Group isn’t just looking at established giants but is also willing to invest in cutting-edge technology with the potential for exponential growth and disruption. This choice suggests a sophisticated understanding of the evolving blockchain landscape. What are the Broader Implications of OFA Group’s Crypto Investment? OFA Group’s substantial investment is more than just a single company’s financial decision; it’s a significant indicator of a larger trend: the increasing institutionalization of the cryptocurrency market. This move sends a powerful signal to other traditional finance firms that digital assets are no longer just a fringe asset class but a viable component of a diversified investment portfolio. Benefits of Such Institutional Inflows: Increased Legitimacy: When publicly traded companies invest, it adds a layer of credibility and legitimacy to the crypto space, helping to dispel past skepticism. Enhanced Liquidity: Large capital injections improve market liquidity, making it easier for both institutional and retail investors to enter and exit positions without significant price slippage. Market Maturation: Institutional involvement often brings higher standards of due diligence, risk management, and regulatory compliance, contributing to the overall maturation of the market. Innovation and Development: More capital flowing into the ecosystem can spur further innovation, attracting top talent and funding new projects across various blockchain networks. Potential Challenges and Considerations: Market Volatility: While institutional money can stabilize markets, crypto remains inherently volatile. OFA Group, like any investor, will face price fluctuations. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Changes in regulations could impact the value and accessibility of these assets. Security Risks: Custody and security of digital assets remain paramount concerns, requiring robust solutions to protect large investments. Public Scrutiny: As a Nasdaq-listed company, OFA Group’s crypto holdings will be under public and shareholder scrutiny, requiring clear communication and performance reporting. What Actionable Insights Can We Glean from OFA Group’s Strategy? For individual investors and market observers, OFA Group’s move offers several key takeaways: Diversification is Key: OFA Group isn’t putting all its eggs in one basket. Their selection of Bitcoin (a store of value), Solana (a high-performance platform), and Sui (an emerging innovative Layer-1) shows a diversified approach to managing crypto exposure. Look Beyond the Top Two: While Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate headlines, institutional interest is clearly expanding to other promising Layer-1s. This encourages deeper research into projects with strong fundamentals and innovative technology. Long-Term Vision: A $100 million commitment, with an option to double, indicates a long-term strategic play rather than short-term speculation. This aligns with a belief in the enduring value and growth of the crypto economy. The Future is Multi-Chain: The investment across different blockchain ecosystems (Bitcoin, Solana, Sui) underscores the growing belief that the future of Web3 will likely be a multi-chain environment, where different blockchains specialize in different use cases. A Compelling Future: The Ripple Effect of OFA Group’s Commitment OFA Group’s decision to invest up to $100 million in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Solana, and Sui marks a pivotal moment for the digital asset industry. It’s a clear signal that traditional finance is not just observing but actively participating in the crypto revolution. This significant crypto investment by a Nasdaq-listed entity validates the growing maturity and potential of the market, paving the way for more institutional capital to flow in. As companies like OFA Group lead the charge, the boundaries between traditional finance and the decentralized world continue to blur, promising an exciting and transformative future for global financial systems.

2025-07-15T20:15:22,"Short interest declines for 6 out of 8 crypto stocks in June","Crypto short interest declined for the third straight month in June. The majority of the crypto stocks saw a decrease in short interest in the month with only Coinbase Global ( NASDAQ: COIN ) and Core Scientific ( NASDAQ: CORZ ) seeing a slight uptick. Short interest in Bitfarms ( NASDAQ: BITF ) saw the steepest fall of nearly three percentage points to 8.61%. Strategy ( NASDAQ: MSTR ) and HIVE Digital Technologies ( NASDAQ: HIVE ) were among other companies that saw short interest decline. It fell to 9.41% and 4.34% for the companies respectively. Meanwhile, Coinbase Global ( COIN ) and Core Scientific ( CORZ ) short interest rose to 6.95% and 19.77% respectively. Overall, about 383M shares were sold short in the crypto sector in June, a dip from 388M in the month of May. According to short interest data as of June 30, the short dollar volume in the crypto stocks was $18.50B, compared to $14.7B the previous month. Of these, Strategy, Coinbase and MARA Holdings continued to attract the most interest from short sellers, accounting for $15.84B or 85.62% of the total bets. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) prices remained wobbly throughout July due to tensions in the Middle East, but despite that, it managed to stay above the $100K mark. However, the cryptocurrency has been showing swift recovery in July with its prices notching new record highs. Bitcoin surged past the $120K mark for the first time on June 15 amid growing optimism over regulatory advancements and increased institutional interest. Going further, Standard Chartered has predicted BTC to climb to around $135K by the end of Q3 and $200K by end-Q4.

While calling on the Fed to cut interest rates, Trump made striking warnings about the Ukraine-Russia war and shared developments regarding a series of trade agreements. Trump argued that the Fed should cut interest rates and stated that Fed Chair Jerome Powell was late on this issue. Fed Richmond President Thomas Barkin offered an indirect response to interest rate policy. Barkin stated that they do not expect a return to the high inflationary pressures seen in 2022, but noted that customs duties could create new price pressures. He added that the final tariff levels have not yet been finalized.

He also said the US will provide full access to the Indonesian market. He noted that Indonesia possesses valuable resources such as rare earth elements. Trump announced that new tariff measures are underway for Brazil, adding that negotiations with the European Union are ongoing and that he believes the results will be satisfactory for everyone. He also stated that new agreements with India, which will provide market access, will be announced soon. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-15T20:00:59,"Cycurion Crypto: A Bold Leap into Bitcoin and Ethereum Investment","BitcoinWorld Cycurion Crypto: A Bold Leap into Bitcoin and Ethereum Investment In a move that’s sending ripples across both the traditional financial markets and the burgeoning cryptocurrency space, Nasdaq-listed Cycurion (CYCU) has announced a significant strategic decision. The company, known for its focus on cybersecurity and data analytics, is venturing into the world of digital assets in a substantial way. This isn’t just a fleeting interest; it’s a calculated long-term play that underscores the growing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. For anyone interested in the evolving landscape of corporate finance and digital assets, Cycurion’s entry marks a compelling moment. What is Cycurion Crypto and Why Does Its Formation Matter? Cycurion has formally established Cycurion Crypto , a wholly owned subsidiary dedicated to acquiring and holding Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) as long-term investments. This isn’t a small-scale pilot project; the company plans an initial investment of $10 million into these crypto assets, leveraging a portion of its existing $60 million equity line of credit. This decision is more than just an allocation of capital; it represents a strategic pivot for a publicly traded company. The formation of a dedicated subsidiary like Cycurion Crypto signals a serious commitment. It suggests that Cycurion views digital assets not merely as speculative instruments but as legitimate components of a diversified corporate treasury strategy. By creating a separate entity, Cycurion can streamline its operations related to crypto asset management, potentially manage regulatory considerations more effectively, and clearly delineate its digital asset holdings from its core business operations. This structure can also provide transparency for shareholders regarding its crypto exposure. Why is Cycurion Making a Significant Bitcoin Acquisition? The decision to prioritize a substantial Bitcoin acquisition aligns with a growing trend among forward-thinking corporations. Bitcoin, often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ has proven its resilience and value proposition over more than a decade. Companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Block have famously added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, viewing it as a superior store of value and a hedge against inflation and currency debasement. Here are some of the key reasons why a Bitcoin acquisition makes strategic sense for companies like Cycurion: Inflation Hedge: With its fixed supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin is seen by many as a strong hedge against the inflationary pressures often associated with traditional fiat currencies. Digital Gold Narrative: As the world becomes increasingly digital, Bitcoin offers a decentralized, borderless alternative to physical gold, appealing to companies seeking modern asset diversification. Scarcity and Demand: The finite supply, combined with increasing institutional and retail demand, creates a compelling value proposition for long-term holding. First-Mover Advantage (for traditional companies): While not the absolute first, being an early adopter among Nasdaq-listed firms still offers a perceived advantage in a rapidly evolving financial landscape. Cycurion’s move suggests confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term appreciation and its role as a foundational digital asset in the global economy. This isn’t about short-term trading; it’s about securing a piece of what many believe will be a fundamental component of future financial systems. How Does Cycurion’s Ethereum Investment Bolster Its Digital Asset Portfolio? Beyond Bitcoin, Cycurion’s equally significant commitment to Ethereum investment highlights a nuanced understanding of the crypto ecosystem. While Bitcoin is primarily a store of value, Ethereum is the backbone of the decentralized internet, powering a vast array of applications, including decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and the broader Web3 movement. An Ethereum investment brings different, yet equally compelling, advantages to a corporate treasury: Ecosystem Growth: Ethereum’s network effect is immense. Its smart contract capabilities enable an entire universe of decentralized applications, indicating strong future growth potential as Web3 adoption expands. Yield Opportunities: While Cycurion’s immediate goal is long-term holding, Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) opens up possibilities for staking rewards, potentially generating passive income on their holdings in the future. Technological Innovation: Investing in ETH is investing in a platform that continuously innovates, driving forward the frontier of blockchain technology. Diversification within Crypto: Holding both BTC and ETH provides a diversified exposure to the two largest cryptocurrencies, capturing both the ‘store of value’ and ‘programmable money’ narratives. Cycurion’s dual approach to Bitcoin and Ethereum demonstrates a strategic understanding of the distinct roles these assets play in the digital economy. It’s not just about owning crypto; it’s about owning the foundational layers of the future digital financial system. Is This the Dawn of Widespread Institutional Crypto Adoption? Cycurion’s announcement is not an isolated incident but rather another strong indicator of accelerating institutional crypto adoption . For years, cryptocurrencies were viewed with skepticism by mainstream finance. However, as the market matured, regulatory clarity improved, and infrastructure developed, more and more traditional institutions are recognizing the potential of digital assets. The trend of institutional crypto adoption is driven by several factors: Maturing Market: Increased liquidity, better custody solutions, and regulated products (like Bitcoin ETFs) have made crypto more accessible and less risky for institutions. Competitive Pressure: As some companies successfully integrate crypto, others feel pressure to explore similar strategies to remain competitive and innovative. Investor Demand: A growing number of institutional and retail investors are demanding exposure to digital assets, prompting companies to respond. Macroeconomic Climate: Persistent inflation and low-interest rates in traditional markets make alternative assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum more attractive for yield and capital preservation. Cycurion’s move further legitimizes crypto as a viable asset class for corporate treasuries, potentially encouraging other companies on Nasdaq and beyond to follow suit. This could lead to a domino effect, where increasing corporate holdings contribute to greater market stability and broader acceptance. What Are the Key Considerations for a Robust Corporate Crypto Strategy? While Cycurion’s move is exciting, developing a sound corporate crypto strategy involves navigating a complex landscape of benefits and challenges. Companies considering a similar path need to undertake careful planning and due diligence. Benefits of a Corporate Crypto Strategy: Benefit Description Diversification Adds a non-correlated asset to the treasury, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Potential for Growth Exposure to a high-growth asset class with significant upside potential. Innovation & Brand Image Positions the company as forward-thinking and technologically savvy, potentially attracting new talent and customers. Inflation Hedge Provides a potential hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Challenges and Considerations for a Corporate Crypto Strategy: Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are known for their price swings, which can impact financial statements. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape is still evolving, posing potential risks for compliance and future operations. Custody and Security: Securely storing digital assets requires specialized expertise and robust security measures to prevent hacks or loss. Accounting and Tax Implications: Managing crypto on the balance sheet involves complex accounting standards and tax reporting requirements. Shareholder Reaction: Explaining the rationale and managing potential skepticism from shareholders. Actionable Insights for Companies: Start Small: Begin with a manageable allocation to test the waters and gain experience. Due Diligence: Thoroughly research the chosen assets, their underlying technology, and market dynamics. Secure Custody: Partner with reputable institutional-grade custodians or implement robust self-custody solutions. Legal and Regulatory Counsel: Engage experts to navigate the evolving legal and tax implications. Transparent Communication: Clearly articulate the strategy and its rationale to stakeholders. Risk Management: Implement a comprehensive risk management framework, including potential hedging strategies. Cycurion’s decision reflects a calculated risk, but one that is increasingly being embraced by corporate leaders who see the long-term value and disruptive potential of digital assets. Cycurion’s formation of Cycurion Crypto and its strategic $10 million investment in Bitcoin and Ethereum represents a significant milestone. It’s a clear signal that publicly traded companies are increasingly viewing cryptocurrencies as legitimate, long-term assets for their balance sheets, rather than mere speculative plays. This bold move not only positions Cycurion at the forefront of corporate innovation in the digital age but also contributes to the broader trend of institutional crypto adoption. As more companies explore similar strategies, the integration of digital assets into mainstream finance will only accelerate, reshaping the future of corporate treasuries and investment portfolios worldwide.

2025-07-15T20:00:55,"Merrill Lynch Ordered To Pay $3,684,163 in Damages and Other Costs Following Unsuitable Private Equity Recommendations: Report","Merrill Lynch will have to shell out nearly $3.7 million in damages and other costs after arbitrators sided against the wealth management firm following a private equity complaint. Two customers, Qun He and Haihui Zhang, filed a complaint against Merrill, Bank of America’s wealth management division, in late 2023, alleging the firm violated securities laws, industry standards and its fiduciary duty. The complainants also alleged the firm acted with negligence and negligent supervision and breached its contract related to various unspecified securities. Merrill Lynch denied the allegations. The U.S. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) made an independent arbitration forum available, and a public panel of arbitrators decided Merrill Lynch should pay the claimants $2.73 million in compensatory damages, $2,002 in costs and $954,634 in attorneys’ fees. Michael Bixby, a Florida attorney who represented the two customers, tells AdvisorHub that a broker recommended investments in illiquid proprietary feeder funds sold by Merrill. Bixby says that the feeder funds pooled capital into private equity investments overseen by institutional investors such as Apollo Global Management, KKR and Blackstone. The lawyer says the recommended funds were advertised as having potential annual returns of 15% to 20%, but ended up recording annual returns around 3% after subtracting private equity fees and administrative charges from Merrill. “We’re pleased with the result, and we think it reflects the arbitrator’s decision that Merrill was responsible for misconduct and held them accountable.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-15T20:00:47,"Corporations Are Actively Adding XRP to Their Balance Sheets. Here’s The Latest","A clear trend is emerging in July 2025: corporations are actively adding XRP to their balance sheets, marking a new chapter in institutional cryptocurrency adoption. This momentum, highlighted by crypto commentator SMQKE on X, shows that XRP is no longer on the sidelines; it is now part of serious corporate treasury strategies. Thumzup Leads the Charge with XRP Accumulation One of the most prominent examples of this shift comes from Thumzup Media Corporation, a Nasdaq-listed company specializing in programmatic advertising and digital branding. In a press release dated July 9, 2025, Thumzup announced that its Board of Directors had approved the accumulation of multiple leading cryptocurrencies, including XRP, Dogecoin (DOGE), Litecoin (LITE), Solana (SOL), Ether (ETH), and USD Coin (USDC). This expansion builds on Thumzup’s earlier Bitcoin acquisition strategy. As of July 8, the company holds 19.106 BTC, valued at approximately $2.1 million. The newly authorized resolution broadens that scope, empowering Thumzup to diversify its digital asset holdings beyond Bitcoin and reinforce its financial infrastructure. JULY 2025: CORPORATES ARE ACCUMULATING XRP ON THEIR BALANCE SHEETS Documented. pic.twitter.com/xSNt3j1Po0 — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) July 15, 2025 Strategic Treasury Management and Digital Diversification Thumzup’s CEO, Robert Steele, emphasized that the move reflects both innovation and financial prudence. “Expanding our exploration into other leading cryptocurrencies aligns with our commitment to innovation and prudent treasury management,” Steele noted. “We believe that a diversified approach to digital assets could enhance our financial flexibility as we continue to scale our AdTech platform and grow our advertiser base.” This corporate mindset reflects a maturing approach to digital assets. Rather than treating cryptocurrencies purely as speculative investments, companies like Thumzup are now viewing them as strategic components of long-term financial planning. XRP Gains Ground Post-Regulatory Clarity A major factor fueling corporate interest in XRP is the regulatory clarity it has recently gained. Following a landmark legal ruling in 2023 , XRP is no longer classified as a security in secondary market transactions. This outcome concluded Ripple’s long legal standoff with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), giving institutional players the green light to hold XRP without fear of legal repercussions. This regulatory resolution has helped reframe XRP as one of the most credible digital assets on the market, especially for institutions looking to diversify beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP’s Utility and Institutional Appeal Beyond legal clarity, XRP’s real-world utility is a key driver of corporate adoption. Ripple’s global payment network, including its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution and the RLUSD stablecoin, is transforming how businesses and banks handle cross-border transactions. XRP’s low cost, high speed , and energy efficiency make it uniquely positioned as a treasury asset for corporations operating in an increasingly digital global economy. For companies like Thumzup, XRP represents more than a bet on crypto; it’s a tool for navigating the future of finance. A Turning Point for XRP and Corporate Adoption As SMQKE observed, July 2025 may be remembered as a turning point for XRP’s institutional credibility. With firms like Thumzup now openly accumulating the asset, a clear signal has been sent to the broader market: XRP is no longer just for retail investors; it’s entering corporate vaults. As more companies recognize XRP’s potential for utility, stability, and diversification, its presence on corporate balance sheets is expected to grow, redefining the future of crypto adoption in the business world.

2025-07-15T20:00:20,"SharpLink Gaming Buys $73M in Ethereum – Smart Money Loads the Dip","Ethereum is undergoing a critical test after breaking above the key $2,850 resistance level and reaching a local high of $3,080. Since then, ETH has retraced by less than 5%, holding steady and showing signs of strength amid broader market volatility. The ability to maintain levels above $2,850 is being closely watched by traders and analysts as a potential launchpad for the next leg higher. Related Reading: Ethereum Supply Locked Hits New ATH: Smart Money Bets On Long-Term Growth Market sentiment remains increasingly optimistic, fueled by strong fundamentals and signs of institutional accumulation. According to on-chain data, SharpLink Gaming—one of the first Nasdaq-listed companies to develop a treasury strategy centered on Ethereum—purchased another $73,210,000 worth of ETH yesterday. This marks another strong signal that smart money is confident in Ethereum’s long-term value. As the crypto market awaits key developments from US regulators during “Crypto Week,” Ethereum’s price action and on-chain indicators remain aligned with a bullish outlook. If ETH can hold current levels and build momentum, the path toward $3,500 becomes increasingly realistic. With rising institutional demand and strong network fundamentals—including record ETH staking—Ethereum appears well-positioned to lead the next phase of the altcoin market rally. SharpLink Becomes Largest Public ETH Holder With $611M in Ethereum SharpLink Gaming has officially become the largest publicly known holder of Ethereum, with total holdings now reaching 205,634 ETH, valued at approximately $611 million. This milestone positions the Nasdaq-listed company at the forefront of institutional Ethereum adoption, setting a new benchmark for corporate treasury strategies in the crypto space. Top analyst Ted Pillows confirmed the latest purchase through on-chain data, revealing that the transaction originated from a Coinbase Prime hot wallet, commonly used by institutions for large-scale acquisitions. This move signals increasing confidence in Ethereum’s long-term value, particularly as companies begin diversifying beyond Bitcoin to gain exposure to smart contract infrastructure. Ethereum’s technical setup remains strong, with price holding well above the $2,850 support zone following its recent move to $3,080. At the same time, fundamentals continue to improve. The ETH supply staked has reached new all-time highs, indicating that more long-term holders are locking up their assets rather than selling into strength. Combined with increased institutional interest, this reflects growing conviction in Ethereum’s role as a foundational layer for Web3. The coming weeks promise to be pivotal. With market sentiment turning bullish and Ethereum gaining traction in corporate circles, the stage is set for a sustained upward move, especially if broader macro and regulatory conditions remain favorable.

ETH Holds Above Key Breakout Zone Ethereum’s 3-day chart shows a bullish continuation pattern, with price currently holding at $2,978 after recently breaking through a critical resistance zone at $2,850. The breakout marked a shift in momentum following a prolonged consolidation phase and pushed ETH to a local high of $3,041.41. Although a slight retracement followed, the current structure remains strong as bulls successfully defend the $2,850–$2,900 area. This level is particularly important as it aligns with multiple technical indicators. The 200-day simple moving average (SMA) sits at $2,805.46, now acting as dynamic support. ETH also remains well above the 50-day and 100-day SMAs, currently at $2,244.80 and $2,661.68, confirming that the broader trend has turned bullish.

According to CNBC, the final tally stood at 196-223, with 13 Republican representatives siding with Democrats to block the motion, marking a rare moment of dissent among House Republicans. House Rejects Key Crypto Legislation The proposed legislation included notable measures such as the GENIUS Act, which aimed to establish regulatory clarity for cryptocurrencies including stablecoins, which have gained notable traction over the past months among traditional firms. In light of the failed vote, House leadership has indicated plans to hold another vote later in the day. However, it remains uncertain whether this subsequent vote will address the same bills or if amendments will be made to appease those who opposed the original motion. Related Reading: Unraveling The Bitcoin Boom: Experts Decode Record $123,000 Surge This vote occurred during “Crypto Week,” a period enthusiastically promoted by President Trump in an earlier Tuesday post on the social media site X (formerly Twitter), in which the president stated: The GENIUS Act is going to put our Great Nation lightyears ahead of China, Europe, and all others, who are trying endlessly to catch up, but they just can’t do it.

Following this historic surge, investors and analysts have begun to re-discuss the next big goal for the world's largest digital asset: reaching the market capitalization of gold. Currently, the price of Bitcoin is hovering around $117,252 and its total market capitalization is around $2.34 trillion. In comparison, gold's estimated total market capitalization is $23.13 trillion. This means Bitcoin currently represents only 10.09% of gold's market capitalization. Analysts estimate that for Bitcoin to “flip”—or surpass—gold's market capitalization, its price would need to rise to $1,161,767, representing an increase of approximately 890% from today's level. Related News: US President Donald Trump Makes Hot Remarks on Cryptocurrencies - Shares a Long Statement Bitcoin's long-term performance is increasing the number of investors who believe this goal is beyond imagination. While Bitcoin has gained over 1,168 percent in the last five years, gold's return has been only around 85 percent. Over the three-year period, Bitcoin has risen 470 percent, while gold's return has remained at 92 percent. This comparison paints a similar picture over the two-year, one-year, and three-month periods. For example, since the beginning of 2025, BTC has increased by approximately 25%, while gold has gained around 26%. However, in just the last three months, Bitcoin has gained over 38%, while gold has only gained around 3%. In the last month, Bitcoin has risen by more than 11%, while gold has lost 4%. There are also significant differences between the two assets on the supply side. Bitcoin's annual supply growth is around 0.83%, while gold's is estimated at around 1.72%. Furthermore, Bitcoin's halving mechanism, which occurs every four years, further reduces new supply, making the digital asset even more scarce. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-15T19:42:37,"3 tokens ready to skyrocket: find the best crypto to watch now","Crypto moves fast, and if you’ve been around for more than five minutes, you know meme coins don’t wait for anyone. They pump hard, they pull back fast, and they often reward the boldest traders who spot them early. Right now, the market is showing serious signs of heating up again, and a handful of meme coins are leading the charge. Here are three tokens grabbing the spotlight this month. These aren’t just random pumps; they’ve got real momentum, engaged communities, and strong upside potential as Bitcoin gears up for its next leg. Whether you’re in it for the memes or the money, these projects deserve a spot on your radar. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) — the meme coin that’s actually building something big If there’s one meme coin that everyone seems to be talking about lately, it’s Little Pepe. But this isn’t just another frog-themed meme riding the Pepe trend; this project is doing something almost no other meme coin has dared to attempt. While most meme tokens focus on short-term hype, $LILPEPE is building its own Layer 2 blockchain on Ethereum. Let that sink in. A meme coin creating its own Layer 2 solution? That’s not just unusual—it’s borderline unheard of in this space. Currently priced at $0.0014 in its presale stage 5, Little Pepe has already raised over $5 million, with more than 4 billion tokens sold. But beyond those numbers, it’s the project’s unique roadmap that has crypto traders watching closely. The team has combined humor, functionality, and community incentives in a way that feels fresh. And here’s the kicker: $LILPEPE isn’t just relying on social media noise. It’s currently running a massive $777,000 giveaway—10 winners will each bag $77,000 worth of tokens. Naturally, this has sent its community into overdrive. But there’s more to it than giveaways. Every time Bitcoin rallies, Little Pepe sees spikes in wallet activity and transaction volume, showing a clear pattern of riding broader market sentiment while also creating its own momentum. Dogwifhat (WIF) — the Solana meme that won’t quit If you’ve spent any time in the crypto scene this year, you’ve definitely seen Dogwifhat—better known as $WIF. With its iconic pink-beanie-wearing dog mascot, this Solana-based meme coin has become the face of Solana’s meme movement. At its core, $WIF started like any other meme coin: goofy branding, viral Twitter posts, and a lot of speculative trading. But the difference? It stuck around. And now, it consistently pulls in daily volumes of over $200 million, with a market cap that comfortably sits among the top meme tokens. What makes $WIF really stand out is how closely it follows Bitcoin’s lead, albeit with more volatility. Every time Bitcoin rallies, $WIF tends to outperform it by a wide margin, as traders rush into meme plays with higher upside potential. Over the last few weeks, it bounced strongly from its recent lows, riding both Solana’s ecosystem growth and general market optimism. Floki (FLOKI) — the viking pup with real utility Floki isn’t new to the scene, but it’s proving that staying power is a superpower in crypto. Born from an Elon Musk tweet, Floki quickly turned into a household name among meme coin traders. Over the past year, Floki has built an ecosystem of products, from NFT metaverses like Valhalla to DeFi tools through FlokiFi. Recently, it regained traders’ attention after high-profile partnerships and exchange listings renewed interest. And it’s been moving in sync with Bitcoin’s rallies, often showing stronger percentage gains during bullish swings. Its price action indicates accumulation as traders build positions for a significant move. Floki appeals to meme coin traders and utility investors with strong liquidity, access to major exchanges, and a recognizable brand. Conclusion: Little Pepe could lead the next meme wave Dogwifhat and Floki have certainly earned their stripes in the meme coin world. Both have strong communities, rising prices, and serious market momentum—but neither feels quite as “early” as Little Pepe right now. What makes $LILPEPE stand out isn’t just its humor or viral memes—it’s the fact that it’s actually building something much bigger beneath the surface, between its Layer 2 blockchain plans, zero-tax trading, and that eye-popping $777,000 giveaway, this isn’t your typical meme project. It’s still in its presale phase, meaning those who spot it now are getting in at a stage where explosive upside is possible. If history repeats itself—and in crypto, it often does—this frog might just be the one hopping ahead of the rest.

2025-07-15T19:28:08,"JUST IN: Three Major Cryptocurrency Bills Expected to Be Legislated in the USA Stalled: Voting Negative – Here are the Details","Cryptocurrency bills expected to be voted on in the US House of Representatives this week have been postponed due to a procedural vote failure. In today's vote, a proposal that would have paved the way for discussion of three important cryptocurrency bills was rejected by 223 “no” votes to 196. According to parliamentary sources, a retry is scheduled for midnight the same day. During what has been dubbed “Crypto Week,” two major bills were on the House agenda: the National Innovation Guidelines and Establishment for U.S. Stablecoins Act (GENIUS) and the Digital Asset Market Openness Act (Clarity). The GENIUS bill has already passed the Senate and is expected to reach President Trump's desk by the end of the week. The GENIUS law stipulates that stablecoin issuances must be fully collateralized only by US dollars or similar liquid assets, requires annual audits for issuers with a market capitalization over $50 billion, and establishes rules for overseas stablecoin issuance. Related News: Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Hater JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon Backtracked Again: “I Still Don't Fully Understand It, But...” The Clarity Act, meanwhile, aims to clarify the regulatory framework for crypto assets by offering a more comprehensive approach. It clarifies the roles and jurisdictions of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), as well as requiring digital asset service providers to notify individual investors and segregate client funds from company assets. A vote was also expected in the House this week on a bill spearheaded by House Republican Deputy Chairman Tom Emmer, which aims to block the direct issuance of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) to individuals. However, the procedural vote failed after 12 Republicans, including Marjorie Taylor Greene, Chip Roy, Michael Cloud, and Anna Paulina Luna, voted “no.” House Speaker Mike Johnson stated that some opposition lawmakers had demanded that all crypto bills be merged into a single text. *This is not investment advice.
