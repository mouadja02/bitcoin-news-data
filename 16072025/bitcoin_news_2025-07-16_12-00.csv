2025-07-16T09:53:12,"Trump steps in to save Crypto Bills from GOP rebels","US President Donald Trump delivered a last-minute save for the crypto industry last night. He reportedly brokered a deal with conservative House Republicans to revive long-awaited crypto bills that had faced a surprise setback recently. The dramatic U-turn followed a failed procedural vote in the House earlier in the day, when 13 hard-line GOP members joined Democrats to block debate on the crypto-friendly legislation. This move sparked panic in markets and tanked crypto-linked stocks. Bitcoin price saw a straight dip to $116k levels from trading over $120K amid the fallout. Trump jumps in to revive crypto bills In a late-night post on Truth Social, Trump revealed he met with the dissenting Republicans in the Oval Office. After a “short discussion,” he said, the lawmakers agreed to flip their votes in favor of the rule required to move the bills to the floor for a full vote. “They have all agreed to vote tomorrow morning in favor of the Rule,” Trump wrote in a post. He added that House Speaker Mike Johnson had joined the meeting remotely and supports fast-tracking the vote. However, he even thanked Congress for its quick and positive response. The House will now consider three major industry-backed crypto bills this week. It is being seen as a moment that could reshape US digital asset regulation. Source: Donald Trump’s Truth Social . According to reports, the procedural vote was derailed when conservatives rebelled over the stablecoin legislation’s structure. Lawmakers, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Tim Burchett objected to House leaders’ decision to take up a Senate-passed version of the bill without allowing amendments. Two of the most vocal rebels, Reps. Anna Paulina Luna and Eli Crane were demanding an amendment that would ban the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency ( CBDC ). This has been seen as a growing concern among crypto advocates. The failed rule vote ended in a 196–223 tally while catching the market off guard. Bitcoin bounces back after Trump’s move The digital asset market printed red indexes all around yesterday. Bitcoin fell by over 5% dipping below $117K, while stocks like Coinbase, Robinhood, and Riot Platforms all slipped in extended trading. The fear and greed index is still flashing “Greed” among the traders. The cumulative crypto market saw a recovery of almost 3% on Wednesday morning. BTC is trading at an average price of $118,727 at press time. The biggest altcoin, Ethereum, surged by over 6% in the last 24 hours, outperforming BTC’s surge. ETH price is now up by 22% in the past 7 days. The altcoin is trading at an average price of $3,170 at press time. The fear and greed index is still flashing “Greed” among the traders. Trump’s recent intervention somehow shows his promise to be a “crypto president.” Now, House leaders are expected to hold a re-vote on the rule opening the door for full debate and passage of the three bills. This includes a bipartisan stablecoin regulation framework, a market structure bill clarifying the role of the SEC and CFTC and protections for self-custody and decentralized finance.

2025-07-16T09:52:22,"Bitcoin 2025 Forecast: Analysts Compare Bitcoin Solaris’ Dual-Consensus Technology to Early Bitcoin Investment","The post Bitcoin 2025 Forecast: Analysts Compare Bitcoin Solaris’ Dual-Consensus Technology to Early Bitcoin Investment appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News With Bitcoin pushing through new forecasts for 2025, investors are starting to ask a familiar question: What’s the next big opportunity? Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is emerging as one of the hottest answers. Its revolutionary approach to mobile mining and blockchain scalability is now drawing comparisons to Bitcoin’s earliest days, especially as analysts dissect the power behind its hybrid dual-consensus architecture. Why Bitcoin Solaris is Being Compared to Early Bitcoin Bitcoin Solaris is not just another speculative crypto. The platform merges the best of Bitcoin’s proven PoW security with the scalability of Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) through a layered architecture. At its foundation, the Base Layer utilizes SHA-256 mining, aligning with traditional Bitcoin miners while offering greater efficiency with 5-minute block times and regular difficulty adjustments. Above this, the Solaris Layer brings high-speed DPoS validation with 15-second blocks and validator rotation to maintain network integrity. This blend ensures BTC-S delivers over 10,000 TPS performance through its dual-consensus approach, putting it in a completely different league from Bitcoin’s limited scalability. The New Frontier: Mobile Mining Bitcoin Solaris is redefining what mining looks like in the modern era. Through the upcoming Solaris Nova App, users can mine directly from their smartphones, laptops, or desktops without needing expensive hardware or deep technical knowledge. While Bitcoin miners still require rigs north of $10,000 to stay competitive, BTC-S breaks those barriers with mobile-first mining solutions designed for the everyday user. The Blockchain Built to Break Limits Say Hello to BTC-S For more technical users, the Solaris Nova App also connects with ASICs and GPUs, automatically optimizing mining operations based on device capabilities. Energy efficiency is central here, with BTC-S reducing consumption by 99.95% compared to traditional Bitcoin mining. Mining Made Easy with Bitcoin Solaris One-click mining via mobile or desktop Dynamic device optimization ensures efficiency Access to decentralized mining power marketplaces Built-in wallet and security features, including biometric login BTC-S mining is not just about access, it is about democratizing blockchain wealth creation in a way Bitcoin never could. Presale Momentum: Why Investors Are Piling In Bitcoin Solaris’ presale is racing toward its $20 launch price with over $7M already raised and more than 14,200 users on board. Currently priced at $12, the next phase moves to $13, with only around 2 weeks left before the presale closes on July 31, 2025. Many call this the shortest, most explosive presale in the market right now. Trust Wallet and Metamask are recommended for seamless token delivery post-launch. Bitcoin Solaris has also passed audits from Cyberscope and Freshcoins, adding more confidence for participants eager to lock in before the next price hike. The influencer space is catching on too. A detailed review by Crypto Show highlights why Bitcoin Solaris is not just another presale; it’s a revolution in crypto mining accessibility and blockchain scalability. Behind the Tech: Dual-Consensus Explained The backbone of Bitcoin Solaris’ strength is its hybrid consensus. Base Layer (PoW): SHA-256 mining, 5-minute blocks, robust security against 51% attacks. Solaris Layer (DPoS): 21 validators, 15-second blocks, dynamic sizes up to 32MB, validator rotation every 24 hours. Cross-Layer Sync: Ensures both layers operate in harmony with state commitments on the Base Layer. This structure allows Bitcoin Solaris to achieve up to 100,000 TPS on its Solaris Layer while maintaining a secure, immutable foundation. Expanding Horizons with Tokenomics Bitcoin Solaris supports a long-term ecosystem through a fair and transparent token distribution. With a fixed supply of 21 million BTC-S tokens, its model reflects Bitcoin’s scarcity while optimizing for modern DeFi and blockchain needs. Token Allocation: 66.66% for mining 20% presale 5% liquidity pools 2% ecosystem development 2% community rewards 2% staking rewards 2% marketing 0.33% team and advisors The full breakdown can be reviewed through Bitcoin Solaris Tokenomics . Final Verdict Bitcoin Solaris is shaping up to be more than a presale sensation. It is a serious contender for those who missed the early Bitcoin wave and are now looking for something with comparable long-term upside but modernized for today’s market needs. From mobile mining to its hybrid blockchain architecture, BTC-S delivers scalability, accessibility, and innovation in one package.

2025-07-16T09:52:20,"Top Altcoins to URGENTLY Accumulate on the Dip","The post Top Altcoins to URGENTLY Accumulate on the Dip appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin surged past a new all-time hig h of $123,000 , but the rally didn’t last long. The price quickly dropped below $118,000 as major investors took profits. This led to a market-wide correction of about 5% to 10% across many cryptocurrencies. Amid the dip, popular crypto analyst Crypto Banter has urged investors to treat the current market dip as a rare chance to urgently accumulate top altcoins before the next major rally. Top Altcoins to Buy The Dip As Bitcoin’s dominance begins to wane and capital rotates into altcoins, several key tokens are flashing strong “buy” signals, supported by both technical trends and recent fundamental developments. Among his top picks, Solana (SOL) stands out. It’s currently trading around $166.7, but according to Banter, any dip below $160 creates a great opportunity to buy before a possible move to $187 or even $240. Next is Cardano (ADA). Banter suggests the best buying zone is between $0.69 and $0.71, especially after the price bounced off key support levels. Ripple’s XRP also made the list. With strong support around $2.60 and $2.80, Banter believes XRP is “gearing up” to break its all-time high and possibly reach $6. For Algorand (ALGO), he recommends buying between $2.55 and $2.70, a range that lines up with past resistance levels. Banter puts extra focus on SUI, saying there’s urgency to buy near $3.70 to $3.84. Right now, SUI is trading around $4, showing a 3.65% gain already. Other Token To Keep An Eye Other altcoins to keep an eye on include Dogecoin (DOGE), trading at $0.17, which could benefit from ETF rumors and growing meme coin interest. NEAR Protocol (NEAR), currently at $2.5, is also showing strong potential for the next rally. Crypto Banter believes that as Bitcoin’s drop slows down and altcoins get stronger, a big rally could be coming. They think altcoins are about to enter a powerful growth phase, helped by good news from governments and more money coming in through ETFs.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/top-altcoins-to-urgently-accumulate-on-the-dip/,"ALTCOIN|TRADING|NEAR|BTC|ADA","News",cryptocompare
2025-07-16T09:50:40,"Altcoin Season: Unveiling Bitcoin’s Dominant Grip on the Crypto Market","BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season: Unveiling Bitcoin’s Dominant Grip on the Crypto Market Are you wondering why your favorite altcoins aren’t soaring while Bitcoin seems to be holding its ground? The latest data from CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index offers a compelling answer. Registering at a score of 38 on July 16, 00:30 UTC, this key metric signals a clear shift: the crypto market is currently deep in what’s known as Bitcoin Season . This score, a seven-point increase from the previous day’s figure reported by Bitcoin World, provides crucial insight into the prevailing sentiment and capital flows within the digital asset space. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index and Bitcoin Season Dynamics To truly grasp the implications of an Altcoin Season Index score of 38, it’s essential to understand what this metric represents and how it’s calculated. The Altcoin Season Index, a proprietary tool by CoinMarketCap (CMC), serves as a barometer for the broader cryptocurrency performance across the market. It offers a snapshot of whether altcoins as a collective are outperforming Bitcoin, or vice-versa. Here’s how the index works: Scope: The index rigorously tracks the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization listed on CoinMarketCap. Exclusions: To maintain accuracy and focus on genuine market movements, stablecoins (like USDT, USDC) and wrapped tokens (like WBTC) are deliberately excluded from the calculation. This ensures the index reflects organic growth and decline in volatile assets. Timeframe: The comparison is made over a 90-day period, providing a medium-term view of market trends rather than short-term fluctuations. The Thresholds: The index operates on a scale from 1 to 100. The distinction between Altcoin Season and Bitcoin Season is defined by clear thresholds: Market Phase Altcoin Season Index Score Criteria Altcoin Season 75 or higher At least 75% of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins/wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. Bitcoin Season 25 or lower 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins/wrapped tokens) have managed to outperform Bitcoin over the past 90 days. Neither / Mixed Between 26 and 74 The market is in a transitional or mixed phase, where neither altcoins nor Bitcoin show clear, sustained dominance. With the index currently at 38, it firmly places the market in Bitcoin Season , indicating that Bitcoin is the dominant force, and most altcoins are struggling to keep pace. Why is the Crypto Market Currently in Bitcoin Season? The current state of the crypto market trends , characterized by Bitcoin’s outperformance, is influenced by several intertwined factors. It’s not just a random occurrence; rather, it reflects a combination of macroeconomic conditions, investor sentiment, and specific catalysts within the crypto ecosystem. Macroeconomic Uncertainty: In times of global economic instability or uncertainty, investors often gravitate towards perceived safer assets. Within the crypto space, Bitcoin is widely considered the most established and least volatile asset compared to the vast array of altcoins. This ‘flight to quality’ sees capital flow into BTC, bolstering its price and dominance. Institutional Adoption and ETFs: The increasing interest from institutional investors and the approval of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in various jurisdictions have provided a significant tailwind for Bitcoin. These developments make it easier for large capital to enter the Bitcoin market, driving demand and price appreciation. Altcoins, while gaining traction, generally lack the same level of institutional accessibility and regulatory clarity. The Bitcoin Halving Narrative: Bitcoin’s programmatic supply shock, known as the ‘halving,’ which reduces the rate at which new bitcoins are created, historically precedes significant bull runs. Even in anticipation, this narrative often draws attention and capital specifically to Bitcoin, as investors front-run potential price surges. Liquidity Concentration: During periods of lower overall market liquidity, capital tends to concentrate in the largest and most liquid assets. Bitcoin, with its deep order books and global accessibility, naturally attracts this liquidity, leaving many altcoins struggling for volume and price momentum. Navigating Altcoin Performance During Bitcoin Dominance For investors, understanding that we are in a Bitcoin Season is crucial for managing expectations and strategizing their cryptocurrency portfolio . When Bitcoin dominates, the vast majority of altcoins typically underperform against BTC. This means that even if an altcoin sees a price increase in fiat terms (e.g., USD), it might still be losing value when measured against Bitcoin. What does this mean for your altcoin holdings? General Underperformance: Expect most altcoins to lag behind Bitcoin’s gains. Some might even decline in BTC terms. Selective Opportunities: While the overall trend favors Bitcoin, there can still be selective opportunities in altcoins driven by specific narratives (e.g., AI, RWA, gaming, specific Layer 2 solutions) or strong fundamental developments. However, these are often higher-risk plays and require thorough research. Reduced Liquidity: Many altcoins may experience lower trading volumes, leading to higher volatility and potentially larger price swings, both up and down, on smaller trades. Capital Rotation: Instead of new money flowing broadly into altcoins, any significant altcoin pumps might be due to temporary capital rotation from Bitcoin profits, which often flows back into BTC after a short period. The challenge for investors during such periods is to resist the urge to chase small altcoin pumps and instead focus on risk management and a clear understanding of market cycles. Historical Context: When Does Altcoin Season Emerge? While we are currently in Bitcoin Season , it’s important to remember that the crypto market is cyclical. Altcoin Season is not gone forever; it’s merely waiting for the right conditions to emerge. Historically, Altcoin Seasons have typically followed periods of Bitcoin dominance or consolidation. Key triggers for past Altcoin Seasons (e.g., 2017, 2021) have included: Bitcoin Price Consolidation: After a significant Bitcoin rally, if BTC enters a period of consolidation or sideways trading, capital often starts flowing down the market cap ladder into altcoins. Investors, having made profits on Bitcoin, seek higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities. Ethereum (ETH) Breaking Out: Often, Ethereum, as the second-largest cryptocurrency and the backbone of many DeFi and NFT ecosystems, leads the charge for altcoins. A strong ETH performance can signal the start of broader altcoin rallies. Emergence of New Narratives: Past Altcoin Seasons were fueled by groundbreaking narratives like DeFi (Decentralized Finance), NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), GameFi, and more recently, AI-related tokens. These narratives attract new users and capital, creating significant buzz and demand for related altcoins. Technological Advancements: Major upgrades or successful rollouts of new technologies (e.g., Ethereum’s Merge, Layer 2 scaling solutions gaining traction) can also ignite interest in specific ecosystems and their native tokens. The Altcoin Index will rise again when these conditions align, signifying a shift in market sentiment and capital flow back into the broader altcoin market. Actionable Insights for Your Cryptocurrency Portfolio Given the current crypto market trends and the prevalence of Bitcoin Season, how should you adjust your strategy? Here are some actionable insights to consider for your cryptocurrency portfolio : Prioritize Bitcoin: In a Bitcoin-dominant market, maintaining a significant allocation to BTC can be a prudent strategy. It offers a relatively stable anchor for your portfolio and is likely to capture the majority of market gains. Strategic Altcoin Selection: If you choose to invest in altcoins, be highly selective. Focus on projects with strong fundamentals, clear utility, active development teams, and robust communities. Avoid chasing hype or meme coins unless you have a high-risk tolerance and a clear exit strategy. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, consider using a dollar-cost averaging strategy. This involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the price. This approach helps mitigate risk during volatile periods and allows you to accumulate assets at a better average price over time. Monitor Dominance Charts: Keep an eye on Bitcoin’s dominance chart (BTC.D). A rising dominance indicates Bitcoin Season, while a falling dominance often precedes or accompanies Altcoin Season. Risk Management is Key: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Set stop-loss orders for trades, and understand that altcoins, especially smaller ones, carry higher risks. Patience and Long-Term View: Market cycles take time to play out. A patient, long-term perspective can help you weather periods of Bitcoin dominance and position yourself for the eventual return of Altcoin Season. The Altcoin Season Index at 38 serves as a clear indicator of the current market climate: Bitcoin is in the driver’s seat. While this means many altcoins will struggle to outperform, it also presents an opportunity for strategic positioning. Understanding the dynamics of the Altcoin Index and Bitcoin Season allows investors to make informed decisions, manage risk effectively, and prepare for the inevitable shifts in crypto market trends . The crypto world is constantly evolving, and staying informed about these key metrics is paramount for navigating its complexities and optimizing your cryptocurrency performance .

2025-07-16T09:47:09,"Analyst Reveals What to Expect Next for Bitcoin! ""Is a Harder Correction Coming?""","Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a historic day on Monday, breaking records for the first time in a row, surpassing $123,000. However, the joy of a new ATH was short-lived. Shortly after surpassing $123,000, BTC began to decline, falling to the $116,000 level. While the market agrees that this correction is due to profit taking and is normal, they are divided on which direction the price will move next. At this point, 21 Shares analyst Matt Mena evaluated the rise in Bitcoin and the subsequent decline. Matt Mena said that a sharp decline in Bitcoin is unlikely as institutional demand strengthens. Mena stated that Bitcoin is unlikely to experience a prolonged sharp decline due to increasing demand and shrinking supply. Stating that Bitcoin supply is at a record low level, and spot BTC ETFs have received several times the amount of BTC expected to be issued this year, the analyst said: “The Bitcoin chart shows a structural imbalance between rising demand and a rapidly declining supply base. While the amount of Bitcoin held on exchanges and over-the-counter platforms is at historic lows, demand continues to grow. US Bitcoin ETFs have absorbed several times the amount of Bitcoin that will be mined this year in just the first half of the year. “I would say that a long-term correction in Bitcoin is impossible, as there are far more positive factors than negative factors in the end.” However, Mena warned that while the outlook is positive, US President Donald Trump’s potential tariff policies and delays in Fed interest rate cuts could lead to a correction in risky assets, including BTC. *This is not investment advice.

With a lot of speculation about the token’s upside circling around, the rally has brought a lot of attention to the Pi Cycle Top Indicator. Using the 111-day and a modified 350-day moving averages to predict when the token might approach the end of the bull run , the Pi Cycle Top Indicator has historically been known as one of the most accurate market timing tools in crypto . According to market analyst Rekt Capital, the averages now suggest that Bitcoin could peak between $130,000 and $170,000 as early as late 2025. Bitcoin Pi Cycle Top Indicator. Source: Rekt Capital Bitcoin upside up to $170,000 According to Rekt Capital’s analysis, the recent momentum is pushing the 111-day moving average up rapidly. Indeed, on June 1, the average was sitting around $92,000, but has since then jumped to approximately $98,000. Accordingly, the projected date of the moving average crossover is being adjusted as well, now being expected to occur in February 2027 as opposed to April 2027, projected just days ago. However, if Bitcoin maintains its upward trajectory, that projection could slide further forward into 2026, or even late 2025, when Bitcoin could potentially hit $170,000.

2025-07-16T09:30:19,"Unveiling the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Navigating Shifting Market Sentiment","BitcoinWorld Unveiling the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Navigating Shifting Market Sentiment Are you tracking the pulse of the cryptocurrency market? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is often considered a crucial barometer, offering a snapshot of investor psychology. Recently, this key indicator, provided by software development platform Alternative, registered a reading of 70 as of July 16. This figure, while a three-point dip from the previous day, keeps the market firmly within the ‘Greed’ zone. But what does this really mean for your crypto holdings and potential future moves? Let’s dive deeper into understanding this fascinating tool and how it can inform your trading strategies . What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Does it Matter? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a powerful analytical tool designed to measure the prevailing market sentiment in the cryptocurrency space. Ranging from 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed), it aims to provide insights into whether investors are overly fearful or excessively greedy. Why is this important? Because extreme fear can present buying opportunities for those brave enough, while extreme greed often signals that a market correction might be around the corner. Understanding this index helps you gauge the collective emotional state of the market, which is often a precursor to significant price movements. When the market is in ‘Extreme Fear,’ it suggests that prices are low and investors are selling off, potentially creating a dip for strategic entry. Conversely, ‘Extreme Greed’ indicates high prices and euphoria, which can lead to overvaluation and subsequent corrections. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? The index isn’t just a random number; it’s a weighted average of several key factors, each contributing to the overall score. This multi-faceted approach provides a more holistic view of market dynamics. Here’s a breakdown of the components: Volatility (25%): This measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average over the last 30 and 90 days. Higher volatility often indicates fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This component assesses the current volume and market momentum. High buying volumes in a strong market often suggest greedy behavior. Social Media (15%): The index analyzes Twitter hashtags and sentiment around Bitcoin, looking for an unusual number of posts and specific keywords to gauge public mood. Surveys (15%): While currently paused, these surveys previously gathered insights from investors about their market perceptions. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): This factor looks at Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market cap. A rising Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate fear, as investors might be fleeing altcoins for the relative safety of Bitcoin. Google Trends (10%): By analyzing search queries for terms like ‘Bitcoin price manipulation’ or ‘Bitcoin bubble,’ the index can infer the level of fear or optimism among retail investors. This comprehensive methodology allows the index to capture various aspects of investor behavior, from trading activity to public discourse, offering a nuanced perspective on market sentiment . Navigating the ‘Greed’ Zone: What Does 70 Mean for Crypto Volatility? A reading of 70, firmly in the ‘Greed’ zone, suggests that investors are generally optimistic and eager to buy. While this sounds positive, it’s a double-edged sword. On one hand, it indicates strong buying pressure and potential for further price appreciation. On the other hand, it also signals caution. When greed becomes excessive, markets can become overheated, leading to speculative bubbles. The recent three-point drop from 73 to 70, even within the ‘Greed’ zone, could be interpreted as a slight cooling of exuberance or a minor shift in sentiment. It’s not a dramatic plunge into fear, but rather a subtle indication that some of the intense buying pressure might be easing. This is particularly relevant when considering crypto volatility , as high greed levels can precede sharp corrections. Is High Bitcoin Dominance a Sign of Fear or Strength? The role of Bitcoin dominance within the index is often debated. When Bitcoin’s market share increases, it can mean a couple of things. Historically, during periods of uncertainty or fear, investors tend to consolidate their holdings into Bitcoin, perceiving it as a safer, more established asset compared to smaller altcoins. This ‘flight to quality’ drives up Bitcoin’s dominance. However, Bitcoin dominance can also rise during strong bull markets if Bitcoin leads the rally. The index specifically looks at the trend of dominance relative to overall market conditions. A sharp rise in dominance without a corresponding overall market rally might indeed signal a cautious sentiment, where investors are de-risking from altcoins. Actionable Insights: Using the Index in Your Trading Strategies The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a valuable tool, but it should never be your sole guide. Here’s how you can integrate it into your trading strategies : Counter-Cyclical Investing: A common adage in investing is to be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful. When the index is in ‘Extreme Fear’ (0-24), it might be a good time to consider accumulating assets, assuming your fundamental analysis supports the move. When it’s in ‘Extreme Greed’ (75-100), it might be prudent to take some profits or reduce exposure. Confirmation Tool: Use the index to confirm your existing analysis. If your technical indicators suggest a market top and the index is showing ‘Extreme Greed,’ it strengthens your sell signal. Similarly, if your analysis points to a buying opportunity and the index is in ‘Extreme Fear,’ it adds conviction. Risk Management: A high ‘Greed’ reading should prompt you to re-evaluate your risk exposure. Are you over-leveraged? Is your portfolio too heavily weighted in highly speculative assets? This is a time to tighten stop-losses and perhaps rebalance. Understand Nuance: A score of 70 is ‘Greed,’ but it’s not ‘Extreme Greed.’ This suggests a strong market, but perhaps not yet at the point of irrational exuberance. It’s a reminder to stay alert but not necessarily panic. Challenges and Limitations While powerful, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index has limitations: Lagging Indicator: The index often reflects sentiment that has already developed. Prices might have moved significantly before the index fully captures the shift. Bitcoin-Centric: While it aims to capture overall crypto sentiment, its components are heavily weighted towards Bitcoin. Altcoin-specific sentiment might differ. Not a Crystal Ball: It cannot predict the future with certainty. Unexpected news or black swan events can override any sentiment reading. Psychological Bias: Even knowing the index is in ‘Greed’ doesn’t mean you can easily overcome your own fear of missing out (FOMO) or fear of losing (FOL). What’s Next for Crypto Market Sentiment? The current reading of 70 in the ‘Greed’ zone, despite a slight dip, indicates a robust and optimistic market. Investors are still largely confident, which is a positive sign for continued interest and potential growth. However, vigilance is key. As the index approaches the higher end of the ‘Greed’ spectrum, the potential for increased crypto volatility and subsequent pullbacks rises. Monitoring the index alongside other fundamental and technical analysis will be crucial for navigating the evolving landscape of the crypto market. Pay close attention to upcoming macroeconomic data, regulatory news, and significant on-chain metrics. These external factors can quickly shift sentiment, pushing the index either higher into ‘Extreme Greed’ or lower towards ‘Fear.’ The beauty of the crypto market lies in its dynamic nature, and staying informed is your best defense. Conclusion: Mastering the Market’s Mood The Crypto Fear & Greed Index provides invaluable insights into the collective psyche of cryptocurrency investors. Its recent reading of 70, holding strong in the ‘Greed’ zone, signals ongoing optimism but also warrants a cautious approach. By understanding its components, particularly the role of Bitcoin dominance and the implications of crypto volatility , you can refine your trading strategies and make more informed decisions. Remember, while sentiment is a powerful force, it’s just one piece of the puzzle. Combine it with thorough research and sound risk management to truly master the market’s mood.

2025-07-16T09:30:05,"Bitcoin ETF Inflows For 2025 Now Outpace 2024, Data Shows","US Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have seen more inflows this year so far compared to the same point in 2024, according to data. Bitcoin Spot ETF Net Inflows Have Crossed $14.8 Billion In 2025 So Far In a new post on X, the Head of Research at CryptoQuant, Julio Moreno, has discussed about how the US spot ETF inflows compare between 2024 and 2025 for Bitcoin. Spot ETFs refer to investment vehicles that provide for an alternative route of exposure to BTC’s price movements. These ETFs trade on traditional platforms and the investor doesn’t have to deal with custody themselves, as the ETF provider holds the coin on their behalf. This means that traders who don’t want to bother with digital asset wallets and exchanges can use these vehicles to invest into Bitcoin in a mode that’s familiar to them. In the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved BTC spot ETFs on January 10th, 2024. The ETFs were quick to gain popularity and today represent an important cornerstone of the market. While 2024 was more of an up-only year for them, 2025 has so far been different. Below is the chart shared by Moreno that shows how the cumulative net inflow trend for the Bitcoin spot ETFs has compared this year versus the last. As is visible in the graph, the US Bitcoin spot ETF inflows were initially ahead of pace in 2025 relative to 2024, but as the market downturn took hold, inflows dried up and 2025 fell significantly behind. A few months into the year, though, demand for spot ETFs started to return and the gap began to shrink. Now, following the latest wave of inflows that has accompanied the rally to the new price all-time highs (ATHs) , 2025 inflows have flipped 2024. From the chart, it’s apparent that 2025 cumulative net inflows stand at $14.8381 billion right now. At the same phase of the year in 2024, they amounted to $14.8278 billion. The spot ETF demand had been sideways at this point of the time last year, so it’s possible that if inflows continue at the current pace, 2025 will gain some distance. That said, it only remains to be seen how long demand can keep up, as in 2024, inflows saw an acceleration toward the end of the year as interest flooded into the market alongside the surge beyond $100,000. In some other news, US Ethereum spot ETFs have been seeing a boom of their own recently, as the netflow has remained green for many weeks now. Last week was the largest for the Ethereum spot ETFs since the SEC approval in mid-2024, with inflows totaling at 225,857 ETH.

The Peak Signal only appears at major market tops, and it hasn’t shown up this time suggesting we’re not at a peak yet. pic.twitter.com/wtojcw4VKs — Axel Adler Jr (@AxelAdlerJr) July 16, 2025 ‘Peak signal’ refers to the metric indicators that say the market is overheated and a corrective phase is approaching. Analyst AxelAdlerJr said in a thread that Peak Signal appears when “the combined normalized Market to Realized Price Index and 30 day/ 365 day Value Days Destroyed ratio score reaches or exceeds 1.” The world’s largest crypto rallied past $122,000 on Monday , driven by renewed institutional interest, and favourable policy. However, it retracted and is now trading at $118,231 at press time. Alexander Zahnd, interim CEO of Zilliqa, calls it a signal that crypto has entered a new phase, where “institutional confidence is driving consistent demand.” He emphasized the quality of the rally this time. “It’s spot-driven, not built on leverage, and it’s unfolding in a relatively calm market,” he told Cryptonews. “That points to a more mature and resilient structure compared to previous cycles.” Bitcoin Could Eventually Hit $130K if Momentum Holds According to Zahnd, Bitcoin’s next bullish key level could be $123,200, with room to push toward $126,500 and eventually $130,000, provided, momentum holds. However, on the downside, BTC would plunge toward $115,000 or $112,000, which could “still be healthy in the broader trend,” he added. “At a macro level, concerns about rising debt, persistent inflation, and uncertainty in monetary policy are all reinforcing the idea of Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. That dynamic isn’t going away anytime soon.” Only Broader Institutional Participation Can Propel BTC to $150K Swiftly Andrejs Balans, risk manager of EU-based fintech platform YouHodler, said that inflows alone will not help propel Bitcoin to $150,000 swiftly. A broader shift in institutional sentiment could be a major catalyst to drive BTC prices up, Balans told Cryptonews. Though institutional exposure has increased through ETFs and custody services, senior banking executives have reiterated their cautious stance, describing crypto as an area of interest but not yet a strategic priority. “Without a broad shift in institutional sentiment, it is unlikely that inflows alone will propel Bitcoin to $150,000 swiftly.” The post Bitcoin ‘Peak Signal’ Not in Yet, Rally May Continue: CryptoQuant Analyst appeared first on Cryptonews .",cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-peak-signal-not-in-yet-rally-may-continue-cryptoquant-analyst/,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET","Bitcoin News|Bitcoin ATH|Bitcoin market",cryptocompare

Brooklyn resident Xerxes Shevar, 57, was part of a prolific international conspiracy ring involving scammers in the United States, Ghana, Nigeria and Ireland, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania. The US Attorney says the conspirators obtained stolen identity info on the internet and then submitted fraudulent federal tax returns under the names of those identities. The alleged scammers also opened bank accounts in those names to receive the returns from the IRS. One of Shevar’s co-conspirators alleges the scam ring attempted to secure around $38 million from the IRS between the tax years 2010 and 2013 and ended up receiving more than $10 million. The scammers allegedly used stolen identities to open 3,493 bank accounts and obtain 4,563 credit cards across 443 financial institutions. In all, the scam ring allegedly victimized 11,468 individuals. Shevar was arrested in February 2024 when he returned to the United States from Ghana. The Brooklyn resident was convicted of wire fraud conspiracy, and US District Judge Susan Paradise Baxter sentenced him earlier this month to three years of probation. The judge also ordered him to pay $290,000 in restitution.

While many companies are purchasing BTC, the latest move came from Cantor Fitzgerald, the company run by US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. According to the Financial Times, Howard Lutnick's company Cantor Fitzgerald is in talks with Adam Back and his company Blockstream to purchase approximately $4 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC). This move is seen as another bold move by Brandon Lutnick, who replaced the company's CEO Howard Lutnick after he was confirmed as the 41st US Secretary of Commerce. Lutnick had previously signed a $3.6 billion Bitcoin deal with SoftBank and Tether in April. According to the FT, citing two unnamed sources, Cantor Fitzgerald-backed Cantor Equity Partners is in final-stage talks with Back to purchase $3 billion to $4 billion worth of BTC. Under the agreement, Cantor will receive Bitcoin from Adam Back. In exchange for Back's Bitcoin contribution, Back and Blockstream will each receive a stake in the SPAC. Cantor Equity Partners is a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) that raised $200 million in its initial public offering in January.

Many altcoins have posted impressive gains over the past day, led by Ethereum’s 6% surge to a five-month high. BTC Eyes $119K The primary cryptocurrency’s historic ascent began last Wednesday. At the time, it was confined in a tight range with an upper boundary of $110,000, which managed to contain the asset during a few breakout attempts. However, the bulls took charge on Wednesday evening and pushed through it to a new all-time high of $112,000. The gains continued in the following 48 hours, and BTC topped at almost $119,000. Following a relatively quiet weekend, bitcoin jumped further on Monday and registered its latest ATH of just over $123,000 . After skyrocketing by $15,000 in five days, the asset was due for a cool-off, which took place yesterday. Amid billions of realized profits , shaky US CPI data , and some uncertainty in the global political scene, bitcoin slipped by several grand and dipped below $116,000. It has reacted well following this decline and has recovered almost $3,000. It now sits close to $119,000, with a market capitalization of $2.360 trillion.

2025-07-16T09:00:29,"Citigroup CEO Confirms Interest In Issuing A Proprietary Stablecoin—Reuters","American multinational investment bank Citigroup announced plans to potentially issue its stablecoin, as CEO Jane Fraser revealed during a post-earnings conference call. As first reported by Reuters, Fraser emphasized the bank’s focus on both the stablecoin initiative and the growing tokenized deposit sector, stating, “This is a good opportunity for us.” As the third-largest lender in the United States, Citigroup is also exploring solutions for reserve management related to stablecoins and providing custody services for cryptocurrency assets. Citigroup’s Plan For New Stablecoin Initiative This announcement follows a strong second-quarter performance for Citigroup, which saw its shares reach their highest levels since the 2008 financial crisis. The bank reported earnings that exceeded Wall Street expectations and unveiled plans to buy back at least $4 billion in stock, further bolstering investor confidence. Related Reading: Unraveling The Bitcoin Boom: Experts Decode Record $123,000 Surge The timing of Citigroup’s stablecoin discussions coincides with the Republican Party’s “Crypto Week,” a campaign aimed at advancing crucial legislation to establish a regulatory framework for digital assets.

However, the path to regulatory approval has faced challenges. Legislative Setback For Crypto President Donald Trump called for swift passage of the GENIUS Act and the CLARITY Act, promoting them as pivotal for the United States to maintain its leadership in digital assets.

Digital Assets are the FUTURE, and we are leading by a lot! Get the first Vote done this afternoon (ALL REPUBLICANS SHOULD VOTE YES!). Despite this push, the House of Representatives voted against the bill, with the final tally standing at 196-223. Notably, 13 Republican representatives joined Democrats in opposing the motion, marking a rare instance of dissent within the party. Related Reading: TD Cowen Projects Bitcoin At $155K By Year-End, Raises Strategy’s Price Target Fox journalist Eleanor Terret reported that some House members expressed concerns that the GENIUS Act could inadvertently pave the way for a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).

2025-07-16T09:00:00,"BitMine Shares Soar After Peter Thiel Investment","BitMine surged by close to 400% after it debuted in the US in May, and recently disclosed it holds over $500 million in Ethereum. Meanwhile, Vanguard became the largest institutional shareholder of Strategy (MSTR), despite publicly criticizing cryptocurrencies and refusing to offer Bitcoin ETFs. Separately, Bitcoin miner MARA expanded its BTC yield strategy by boosting its allocation with Two Prime from 500 to 2,000 BTC. BitMine Gains Big After Thiel Buys In Shares in BitMine Immersion Technologies surged 12.5% in after-hours trading on Tuesday after the disclosure that billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel acquired a large stake in the company. According to a regulatory filing , Thiel bought 5.09 million shares through various entities under his Founders Fund, which amounts to a 9.1% ownership in the crypto mining service provider. The move happened during a flurry of crypto-related activity tied to Thiel, who is also known for co-founding PayPal and Palantir Technologies, and has a reported net worth of $22.7 billion. Peter Thiel Thiel has been increasingly active in the crypto and fintech space. Earlier this month, he joined other tech billionaires in applying for a bank charter for Erebor , a new financial institution that plans to fill the void left by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023. Additionally, his firm was reportedly leading a $200 million funding round for prediction market platform Polymarket, valued at $1 billion. Meanwhile, Bullish, a Thiel-backed digital asset exchange, reportedly filed confidential paperwork to pursue an initial public offering. BitMine’s stock closed down 2.5% on Tuesday at $44.97 but rallied in after-hours trading. This allowed it to hit $48.50 at one point. Since its US debut on May 8 at $8 per share, BitMine’s stock soared by close to 400%. In its most recent quarterly report, the company announced a 67.5% year-on-year increase in net revenue and a 43.18% rise in net profits. BitMine share price over the past 24 hours (Source: Google Finance ) Another sign of its deepening crypto strategy is BitMine announcement on Monday that it now holds over $500 million in Ethereum (ETH) in its treasury. The company accumulated more than 163,000 ETH at an average purchase price of $3,072 per token. This massive acquisition was funded through a $250 million private placement that concluded on July 9. Vanguard Becomes Top Strategy Holder Even the most traditional forces in finance are becoming entangled in crypto’s influence. Vanguard, one of the world’s largest investment firms, recently became the biggest institutional shareholder of Strategy (MSTR), the company led by Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor. According to data from Fintel , Vanguard now holds more than 20 million shares of MSTR, which accounts for roughly 8% of its Class A common stock. This gives the firm indirect exposure to more than 200,000 Bitcoin held on Strategy’s balance sheet. (Source: Fintel ) Strategy features in various Vanguard mutual funds and ETFs, including the widely held Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund. Its position in Strategy arises from the firm’s passive investing strategy, which tracks broad market indices and includes companies regardless of their business models or leadership ideologies. Despite its exposure to Bitcoin through Strategy, Vanguard is still publicly skeptical of cryptocurrencies. The firm repeatedly warned investors about the risks of volatile digital assets and chose not to offer spot Bitcoin ETFs, even as rivals like BlackRock surged ahead. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has become its most profitable ETF and is expected to cross $100 billion in assets under management. Vanguard’s CEO Salim Ramji said in a May interview with Bloomberg TV that Vanguard prioritizes long-term dependability over chasing financial trends, and that the company is not in the business of speculative assets. In a separate interview with ETF.com, Ramji held firm that Bitcoin doesn’t align with Vanguard’s 50-year investment philosophy. The firm’s unexpected exposure to Bitcoin reignited conversations around the passive investing model. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas pointed out the irony by explaining that index funds must include all stocks in a benchmark — even those the managers may disapprove of. “God has a sense of humor,” Balchunas said , due to the paradox of one of Bitcoin’s biggest corporate holders being backed by one of its most vocal institutional critics. MARA Invests in Two Prime MARA Holdings also recently completed a minority acquisition of institutional investment adviser Two Prime. The deal included a $20 million equity investment, and it greatly increased MARA’s Bitcoin allocation with Two Prime from 500 BTC to 2,000 BTC. These holdings will be placed in a Separately Managed Account that is designed to generate yield. Two Prime is registered with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It provides Bitcoin exposure and management services to institutional clients and professional investors. MARA’s decision to grow its stake in Two Prime forms part of its strategy to diversify and make better use of its Bitcoin holdings, which were initially built through self-mining and later expanded via stock sales. This pivot happened as Bitcoin miners, including MARA, face growing pressure after the latest halving event, which cut block rewards in half and reduced revenue potential across the industry. Despite posting a 30% increase in revenue to $214 million in the first quarter, MARA reported a net loss of $533 million, driven by rising energy and equipment costs. In response, many miners are now exploring alternative revenue models, including hosting AI data centers and repurposing infrastructure for high-performance computing.

2025-07-16T08:59:07,"Michigan town with no Bitcoin Kiosks plans to impose strict rules on crypto ATMs","Grosse Pointe Farms, a small town in Michigan, USA, is the latest to join a growing list of US municipalities imposing strict regulations on cryptocurrency ATMs. Grosse Pointe Farms’s city council has recently passed an ordinance targeting the regulation of crypto kiosks, popularly known as Bitcoin ATMs, despite the town not currently having any such machines. Officials say the decision was fuelled by recent reports of a local being defrauded through a crypto ATM in nearby St. Clair Shores. The ordinance was passed unanimously during a city council meeting, making Grosse Pointe Farms one of the first municipalities in Michigan to formally regulate cryptocurrency kiosks. City attorney Bill Burgess outlined four key measures included in the ordinance. Notably, Operators of future crypto ATMs will be required to register with the Department of Public Safety and obtain a business license prior to deployment. The ordinance also mandates that operators display warning signs that alert users of the risks of fraud and the irreversible nature of crypto transactions. On top of that, new users will be subject to transaction caps during their initial two-week period. Specifically, first-time users will be limited to $1,000 per day and $5,000 in total transactions within the first 14 days. The limits are being put in place to provide a buffer period for users to familiarise themselves with the machines before conducting higher-value transfers. During the meeting, council member Lev Wood stated that the objective of this ordinance was to improve transparency and prevent residents from falling victim to any further scams. “The crooks tell people to go and put money into these machines, and it’s a very untransparent situation. What we want to do with our ordinance tonight is to enhance transparency and provide a little bit of help to our residents,” Wood said. Crypto ATMs, like standard ATMs, allow anyone to convert their fiat currency to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum and vice versa. However, the anonymous and irreversible nature of cryptocurrency transactions and the fact that Bitcoin ATM transactions often lack identity verification have made these kiosks a tool for scammers to launder illicit loot . Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel has previously issued statewide warnings about scams tied to crypto ATMs, urging residents to be careful when asked to send money through these machines. Local media, including the Detroit Free Press, have also reported multiple incidents involving unsuspecting residents. US states are cracking down on crypto ATMs Similar concerns have prompted several other US states and cities to enact their own restrictions or regulations on crypto ATMs in recent months. In Washington state, the city of Spokane recently became the first in the state to outright ban cryptocurrency kiosks. The Spokane City Council passed the measure unanimously, ordering all operators to remove their kiosks within 60 days. Before that, Nebraska signed the Controllable Electronic Record Fraud Prevention Act into law in March, which mandates operational licenses, transaction caps of $2,000 for new users, and refund policies for those defrauded. Similarly, North Dakota lawmakers passed House Bill 1447 earlier this year, formally imposing a $2,000 daily transaction cap, mandating blockchain analytics for fraud detection, and requiring operators to submit quarterly reports. Arizona also passed a similar bill earlier this year, setting a lower daily transaction limit of $1,000 along with mandatory licensing and consumer protection measures.

Strategy’s (MSTR) aggressive bitcoin BTC acquisition strategy has dramatically boosted the value of its convertible debt. With bitcoin steady near its record price and the company's shares rebounding toward $450, five of the six bonds outstanding are deep in the money, meaning the stock price exceeds their conversion prices. Only the 2029 note, with a high $672.40 conversion price, remains out of reach. The Tysons Corner, Virginia-based company issued convertible notes totaling $8.2 billion in notional principal with ultra-low average coupons of just 0.421%. The bonds, which mature between 2028 and 2032, carry a set price based on MSTR and BTC levels at the time of issues at which the debt can turn into the common stock. MSTR stock has rebounded from as low as $235 three months ago and is within sight of late last year's $543 record. The rally has pushed the bonds’ market value to $13.4 billion, roughly $5.2 billion above their notional value. The premium reflects how much investors are willing to pay in secondary markets, driven by the bonds’ potential to convert into valuable equity. Of late, however, Strategy has paused issuing new convertible notes. That may be due to more cautious sentiment as reflected in the options market. As of July 15, MSTR’s implied volatility sits at 53.1%, well below past highs above 200%. Implied volatility is an indication of how much the options traders believes the stock will move in the future based on their market positioning. Open interest remains healthy at over 2.4 million contracts, but both the open interest put-call ratio (0.93) and the volume put-call ratio (0.62) indicate neutral sentiment, suggesting traders are not aggressively betting on a major surge in the stock. A put is a cautious position that offers protection against price declines in the underlying asset while a call is a bullish instrument that allows traders to profit when the price rises. Additionally, trading volume is just 20% of its 30-day average, hinting at reduced speculative interest. This muted options activity implies that while MSTR’s price is high enough to put five of the six convertible bonds deep in the money, there may not be the same frothy market enthusiasm that allowed the company to issue convertibles at ultra-low coupons and favorable terms. Investors might demand higher yields or lower conversion prices for any new issuance, which could dilute existing shareholders sooner.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/16/strategys-convertible-bond-prices-surge-as-stock-advances-back-toward-record-high,"MARKET|BUSINESS|TRADING|BTC","Markets|MicroStrategy|Bitcoin|Bonds|News",cryptocompare
2025-07-16T08:49:08,"Bitcoin (BTC) Dips $7,400: Just a Temporary Blip?","Having become extremely overbought, and coming into the release of the latest US CPI data, Bitcoin suffered a huge $7,400 correction in a matter of just two days. Is this something for investors to be concerned about, or was this just a blip in Bitcoin’s rise into the final leg of the bull market? Bitcoin was just too overbought US CPI data came in slightly hotter than expected, causing a 0.4% fall in the S&P 500 Index, but the tech-heavy Nasdaq ended the day higher. Now these inflation figures are known and priced in, some stability can potentially return to markets, that is of course, if Wednesday’s PPI figures do not cause more concerns. As far as Bitcoin was concerned, the latest sharp correction was far more likely to be caused by too much elation and overbuying than the odd 0.1% on top of the expected US monthly inflation print. On just about every short-term indicator the $BTC price was very overbought and a market-calming correction was exactly what was needed. While the sharpness of the correction perhaps caught many investors by surprise, it certainly helped to reset the market. $BTC price starts to build again Source: TradingView The 4-hour chart reveals how the $BTC price breakout and surge up to the all-time high was just as quickly negated with an even bigger price move to the downside. That said, now that the dip is potentially over with, the bulls have the opportunity to start bringing the price back to the top. The Fibonacci extensions are showing that the price is consolidating above the first 0.236 level. It might be expected that more price growth could take place from here. A tale of wicks Source: TradingView The daily chart shows the long candle wick to the upside left behind after the two-day dip. That said, a long wick was left in the opposite direction following the rapid recovery. The bulls will be hoping that the last one cancels out the first one. At the bottom of the chart, the RSI is showing that the indicator has moved back down, although it is angled slightly up as of Wednesday morning. The dashed blue line shows that the indicator is still in a downtrend. This will need to be broken to the upside for price to continue to move higher. Source: TradingView The weekly gives a more damning view of the candle wick to the upside. Looking across at similar-sized candle wicks to the upside during previous price history, it should be noted that they did generally show up at the tops of downtrends. Nevertheless, the $BTC price is only 3 days into this week, and with potentially more upside to come, this wick is probably going to reduce in size. The RSI at the bottom of the chart is in a similar condition to the daily. A downtrend has been in force for quite some time, and this will need to be broken if price is to continue going higher. Correction made - time to move on? Yes, Bitcoin did descend precipitously, and more than $7,000 was wiped off of the price in a very short space of time. However, in the grand scheme of things this is very likely to be just a blip. In addition, these corrections are healthy and they allow the build up of air to be released out of the bottle before the market gets too frothy and we end up with a perilous cascade of selling. Bitcoin has had its correction, and now it’s time to move on and continue into the rest of this bull market, US PPI data allowing of course.

2025-07-16T08:40:27,"Meta AI: Critical Security Bug Resolved, Safeguarding User Prompts","BitcoinWorld Meta AI: Critical Security Bug Resolved, Safeguarding User Prompts In the rapidly evolving digital landscape, where the promise of artificial intelligence (AI) converges with the foundational principles of blockchain and decentralization, the security of our digital interactions is paramount. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and tech-savvy individuals, understanding the vulnerabilities within cutting-edge AI platforms like Meta AI is crucial, especially when it concerns the privacy of personal data. Recently, Meta addressed a significant security flaw in its AI chatbot, a fix that underscores the ongoing battle to protect user information in the age of generative AI. Unpacking the Meta AI Vulnerability: What Happened to User Prompts? The core of this security incident revolved around a flaw that allowed unauthorized access to users’ private AI prompts and their generated responses. Sandeep Hodkasia, the astute founder of security testing firm Appsecure, was the one to unearth this critical vulnerability. He exclusively shared his findings with Bitcoin World, detailing how he privately disclosed the bug to Meta on December 26, 2024. For his diligent work and responsible disclosure, Meta paid him a substantial $10,000 in a bug bounty reward. Hodkasia’s discovery stemmed from his meticulous examination of how Meta AI enables logged-in users to edit their AI prompts to regenerate text and images. He found that when a user modified their prompt, Meta’s back-end servers would assign a unique, numerical identifier to both the prompt and its AI-generated response. The critical flaw emerged when Hodkasia analyzed the network traffic in his browser during a prompt edit. He realized he could manipulate this unique number, and Meta’s servers, without proper verification, would return the prompt and AI-generated response of an entirely different user. This meant Meta’s servers were failing to perform a fundamental security check: ensuring that the user requesting the prompt and its response was actually authorized to view it. Hodkasia noted that these prompt numbers were “easily guessable,” posing a significant risk. A malicious actor could potentially scrape vast amounts of users’ original prompts and their AI-generated content by rapidly iterating through these numbers using automated tools, compromising the privacy of countless individuals. The Indispensable Role of Bug Bounty Programs: A Shield for Innovation Meta’s swift response and the subsequent $10,000 payout to Sandeep Hodkasia highlight the critical importance of bug bounty programs in today’s digital security landscape. These programs incentivize ethical hackers and security researchers to identify and responsibly disclose vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by malicious actors. Instead of waiting for a breach to occur, companies proactively invite experts to test their systems, turning potential adversaries into allies. Key Benefits of Bug Bounty Programs: Proactive Security: They allow companies to identify and fix vulnerabilities before they are publicly exploited, significantly reducing the risk of data breaches and reputational damage. Diverse Expertise: By opening their systems to a global community of security researchers, companies gain access to a vast pool of diverse skills and perspectives, often uncovering issues that internal teams might miss. Cost-Effective: While bounties can be substantial, they are often far less costly than recovering from a major security breach, which can involve significant financial penalties, legal fees, and customer churn. Enhanced Trust: Publicly acknowledging and rewarding researchers for their findings builds trust with users and demonstrates a company’s commitment to security and transparency. In this instance, Meta confirmed to Bitcoin World that they fixed the bug in January 2025 and, crucially, “found no evidence of abuse and rewarded the researcher,” as stated by Meta spokesperson Ryan Daniels. This outcome underscores the success of the bug bounty model: a vulnerability was identified, responsibly disclosed, patched, and users remained safe. Navigating Data Privacy in the AI Frontier: Why It Matters More Than Ever The news of this Meta AI bug comes at a pivotal time when tech giants are intensely competing to launch and refine their AI products. However, this rapid innovation often runs parallel to significant security and data privacy risks. AI models, by their very nature, process immense volumes of data, much of which can be highly personal or sensitive. Ensuring the privacy and security of this data is a monumental challenge. Meta AI’s standalone app, which debuted to compete with rivals like ChatGPT, faced a rocky start earlier, with some users inadvertently sharing what they believed were private conversations with the chatbot. This incident, combined with the recently patched prompt leakage bug, highlights a broader industry challenge: balancing the excitement of AI’s capabilities with the fundamental right to privacy. Challenges in AI Data Privacy: Data Volume and Diversity: AI models ingest vast and varied datasets, making it complex to track and secure every piece of information. Inference Risks: AI can infer sensitive attributes about individuals even from seemingly innocuous data, creating new privacy concerns. Model Memorization: Large language models can sometimes “memorize” parts of their training data, potentially regurgitating private information if not properly handled. Prompt Engineering Exposure: As seen with Meta AI, the very input users provide to AI can be sensitive, making prompt security paramount. For platforms building on decentralized principles, like many in the crypto space, the emphasis on user control and transparency serves as a strong counterpoint to these centralized AI challenges. The incident with Meta AI serves as a stark reminder that robust privacy-by-design principles must be integrated into every stage of AI development, not as an afterthought. Protecting Your User Prompts : A New Frontier of Digital Assets? While a simple text input, a “user prompt” to an AI chatbot can contain a wealth of personal, creative, or even proprietary information. Imagine a user brainstorming a new business idea, drafting sensitive emails, or even generating creative content for a novel. The leakage of such user prompts could lead to intellectual property theft, reputational damage, or the exposure of private thoughts and plans. In the context of generative AI, prompts are not merely inputs; they are often the genesis of unique outputs, making their privacy as critical as the privacy of personal messages or financial data. This incident prompts users to consider their interactions with AI platforms with a heightened sense of awareness. Actionable Insights for AI Users: Be Mindful of Sensitive Information: Avoid inputting highly personal, financial, or confidential company data into public AI chatbots. Understand Platform Privacy Policies: Take the time to read how AI services handle your data, prompts, and generated content. Utilize Secure Channels: For sensitive AI-driven tasks, explore enterprise-grade or privacy-focused AI solutions that offer stronger data protection. Regularly Review Settings: Check privacy and security settings on your AI accounts to ensure they align with your preferences. The concept of a prompt as a valuable, protectable asset is gaining traction, especially as AI becomes more integral to creative and professional workflows. This incident underscores the need for both platforms and users to treat prompts with the same care afforded to other forms of digital intellectual property. Strengthening AI Security : The Path Forward for a Safer Digital World The Meta AI bug fix is a testament to the continuous and often challenging work required to maintain robust AI security in a rapidly advancing technological landscape. As AI systems become more complex and deeply integrated into our daily lives, the potential attack surface expands, demanding constant vigilance and innovative security measures. The lessons learned from this incident extend beyond Meta. They serve as a crucial reminder for all AI developers and deployers to prioritize security and privacy from the ground up. This includes implementing rigorous authorization checks, employing robust encryption, conducting regular security audits, and fostering strong relationships with the cybersecurity research community through initiatives like bug bounty programs. For the broader tech community, especially those within the blockchain and cryptocurrency spheres, the emphasis on transparent, auditable, and secure systems resonates deeply. The future of AI hinges not just on its intelligence and capabilities, but fundamentally on the trust users place in its security and ethical operation. As AI continues to evolve, so too must our commitment to safeguarding the digital integrity and privacy of every user. The resolution of this critical Meta AI bug underscores the relentless effort required to secure our digital future. It highlights the invaluable role of ethical hackers and robust bug bounty programs in protecting user data. As AI continues to reshape our world, the ongoing commitment to privacy and security will be paramount for fostering trust and ensuring responsible innovation.

2025-07-16T08:30:24,"Bitcoin: Unwavering Accumulation by Long-Term Holders Amidst Market Swings","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin: Unwavering Accumulation by Long-Term Holders Amidst Market Swings In the often-turbulent world of cryptocurrency, where market sentiment can shift on a dime and price charts resemble roller coasters, a fascinating trend has emerged that speaks volumes about conviction: long-term Bitcoin holders are not just holding; they’re aggressively accumulating. This quiet but powerful movement of Bitcoin accumulation by seasoned investors offers a compelling counter-narrative to the prevailing market uncertainty. Why are Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Defying Market Gravity? July 2023 was a period marked by considerable apprehension across financial markets, and Bitcoin was no exception, seeing its price hover around the $30,000 mark after a period of volatility. Yet, amidst this backdrop, a remarkable statistic from CryptoQuant, highlighted by CryptoPotato, revealed that wallets traditionally associated with never-selling — often referred to as ‘HODLers’ — added an astonishing 248,000 BTC to their holdings. This figure isn’t just significant; it’s far above the monthly average, underscoring an unwavering belief in Bitcoin’s intrinsic value and future potential. This phenomenon isn’t new, but its intensity during a period of perceived weakness is particularly telling. It suggests that a core group of investors views price dips not as a reason to panic sell, but as opportune moments to acquire more. This behavior stands in stark contrast to the often-fickle nature of short-term trading, where fear and greed dictate immediate actions. For these dedicated investors, Bitcoin isn’t merely a speculative asset; it’s a foundational store of value, a hedge against inflation, and a decentralized digital future. What Drives This Remarkable Bitcoin Accumulation Trend? The motivations behind such robust Bitcoin accumulation are multi-faceted, rooted in both macro-economic outlooks and Bitcoin’s unique properties. Several key factors contribute to this long-term conviction: Digital Gold Narrative: Many view Bitcoin as the modern equivalent of gold, a finite asset that serves as a hedge against currency debasement and economic instability. In times of global uncertainty, the appeal of a decentralized, immutable asset grows stronger. Halving Event Anticipation: With the next Bitcoin halving event on the horizon (expected in 2024), which historically precedes significant bull runs due to reduced supply, long-term holders are strategically positioning themselves to capitalize on potential future price appreciation. Growing Institutional Interest: Despite market fluctuations, institutional adoption continues to slowly but steadily increase. The prospect of Bitcoin ETFs and growing corporate interest validates Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, drawing in more serious capital. Technological Resilience: Bitcoin’s network has proven incredibly robust over more than a decade, with no downtime and increasing security. This reliability builds confidence among those looking for long-term investments. This strategic patience highlights a divergence in market philosophy. While day traders focus on short-term gains and losses, long-term holders are playing a different game, one focused on the fundamental value proposition of a decentralized, scarce digital asset. How Does This Impact Overall BTC Price Analysis ? The consistent and significant accumulation by long-term holders has profound implications for BTC price analysis , even if its immediate effects aren’t always visible. Here’s why this trend matters: Reduced Circulating Supply: When Bitcoin moves into long-term holding wallets, it effectively removes that supply from active circulation. This creates a supply shock over time, meaning fewer Bitcoins are available for sale on exchanges. Establishing a Price Floor: Strong accumulation during price dips can act as a natural buying pressure, potentially setting a more robust price floor for Bitcoin. It suggests that there’s significant demand at lower price levels, limiting downside risk. Indicator of Fundamental Strength: This behavior is a strong vote of confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term viability. It suggests that despite bearish short-term narratives or macro headwinds, a significant portion of the market believes in its ultimate success, which can influence broader sentiment over time. While accumulation alone doesn’t guarantee immediate parabolic price moves, it lays the groundwork for sustainable growth. It signifies that the asset is being held by conviction, rather than speculation, which is a healthier foundation for any market. Decoding the Current Crypto Market Sentiment : A Tale of Two Traders? The July accumulation trend paints a vivid picture of conflicting forces shaping current crypto market sentiment . On one side, we observe the steadfast conviction of long-term holders; on the other, the apprehension of some large traders and short-term speculators. This divergence creates a nuanced market environment: Metric Long-Term Holders (HODLers) Short-Term Traders / Large Bearish Traders Primary Goal Wealth preservation, long-term growth Short-term profit, capitalizing on volatility Reaction to Dips Accumulation (buying more) Selling (cutting losses, taking profits) Market View Fundamentally bullish Technically driven, often bearish in dips Impact on Supply Reduces circulating supply Increases circulating supply (selling pressure) This ‘tale of two traders’ highlights the maturity of the Bitcoin market. It’s no longer just a playground for quick gains; it’s a battleground of philosophies. Understanding this dynamic is crucial for investors navigating the mixed signals and deciding their own strategy. Embracing the Bitcoin HODL Strategy: Is it for You? The consistent success of long-term holders often prompts the question: should I adopt a Bitcoin HODL strategy? For many, the answer is a resounding yes, provided they understand its nuances and have the right mindset. HODLing, a deliberate misspelling of ‘hold,’ signifies a strategy of buying and holding Bitcoin for extended periods, regardless of short-term price fluctuations. Benefits of HODLing: Compounding Gains: Over long periods, Bitcoin’s historical performance suggests significant potential for compounding returns, far outweighing short-term trading gains for many. Reduced Stress: HODLing eliminates the constant stress of day trading, market timing, and emotional decision-making driven by volatility. Lower Transaction Costs: Fewer trades mean fewer fees, maximizing your capital. Alignment with Fundamentals: It allows you to invest based on Bitcoin’s core value proposition rather than fleeting market sentiment. Challenges of HODLing: Patience is Key: You must be prepared to weather significant bear markets and periods of stagnation. Psychological Resilience: Seeing your portfolio drop by 50% or more requires immense mental fortitude to avoid panic selling. Opportunity Cost: While holding, you might miss out on other short-term opportunities, though this is often offset by long-term gains. For those considering this path, actionable insights include dollar-cost averaging (DCA) – investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price – and only investing capital you can afford to lose. Research, conviction, and a long-term perspective are your best allies. The Enduring Power of Conviction The remarkable Bitcoin accumulation by long-term holders in July 2023 serves as a powerful testament to the enduring belief in Bitcoin’s future. While the broader market may grapple with uncertainty and mixed signals, a significant segment of the investor base is doubling down on their conviction, viewing dips as opportunities rather than threats. This unwavering commitment not only strengthens Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition but also sets the stage for its potential long-term growth. It’s a reminder that in the volatile world of crypto, sometimes the most strategic move is simply to hold, and even better, to accumulate.

2025-07-16T08:27:48,"Bitcoin (BTC) Whales Break Silence: Is a Mid-Cycle Pivot Imminent?","Bitcoin’s (BTC) rally hit a pause as prices slipped 4% from all-time highs, in a typical pullback during a bull market. Its on-chain signals are now flashing a possible market pivot as whales become active and dormant supply begins flowing again in July. Dormant Coins Flow, Whales Strike In its latest analysis, CryptoQuant revealed that Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) surged to 28 million this week, which indicates older Bitcoin previously held inactive is now being transferred. This pattern is historically tied to large holders repositioning near cycle midpoints or local tops. In addition to this, Net Realized Profit and Loss (NRPL) also spiked above $4 billion in realized profits, the highest since early Q2. Such a trend reflected significant profit-taking by whales and recent buyers while Bitcoin’s price hovers around $117,000-$120,000. The price action amid heavy realized profits suggests “resilient underlying demand or a delayed reaction.” Interestingly, this wave contrasts with late June, when NRPL data showed realized losses and modest profits. It hints at capitulation by late entrants while long-term holders accumulated quietly. The current environment flips this narrative: profits now dominate while older coins flow into the market, which aligns with Q3’s institutional rebalancing phase. It also indicates that these movements are strategic rather than random. Previously, simultaneous spikes in NRPL and CDD have preceded periods of volatility, including local tops, consolidations, or mid-cycle pauses, which means that whales and large players are coordinating activity. Whether this leads to further distribution or an extended rally will depend on follow-through in the coming weeks. But for now, whales are active, profits are being locked in, and dormant supply is re-entering circulation. CryptoQuant stated that the market may stand at a hidden inflection point, layered beneath the surface of stable Bitcoin price action. With whales active and dormant coins re-entering circulation, all eyes are on Bitcoin’s key levels. The recent rally to $124K and the subsequent correction have turned this level into a local top. Key Levels Bitcoin has pulled back after hitting $123,000, a level aligning with the +1 standard deviation of the Short-Term Holder (STH) Realized Price. As such, CryptoQuant stated that the resistance now sits at $124K and $136K, the latter representing the +1 STD of holders with coins less than one month old, a cohort often linked with overbought conditions when the crypto asset approaches this band. On the downside, $113K, which aligns with the +0.5 STD above the STH Realized Price, is emerging as a support during consolidations. Meanwhile, $111K is the average cost basis for new entrants, thereby creating a psychological floor if it corrects further. The most critical level remains $101K, the baseline STH Realized Price, which historically signals medium-term bullish structure and strongholder conviction if the crypto remains above it.

ETH has climbed above $3,100, while altcoins have also seen significant gains. While this rise reignited the enthusiasm in the market, cryptocurrency analysis company Santiment said in its latest post that investors showed intense interest in Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), PEP, PEPE and MicroStrategy (MSTR) on social media. Bitcoin (BTC): The word 'BTC' has been trending on Reddit, Telegram, and Twitter due to intense discussions about Bitcoin's price movements, investment strategies, and market dominance. This signals an upward trend and increasing adoption. Bitcoin is expected to reach new market capitalization milestones. Ethereum (ETH): Its institutional appeal, market capitalization, transaction behavior, and potential future performance are key factors. Ethereum's role in DeFi, AI token ecosystems, and blockchain technology is further fueling interest and market activity, bringing ETH into focus within the crypto community. XRP: XRP has experienced significant price gains, nearing all-time highs, as analysts predict potential rallies amid favorable market conditions and regulatory developments. This surge has seen investors closely monitor its movements and its correlation with Bitcoin. PEP: The word 'Pep' has been trending due to its association with the layer-1 cryptocurrency Pepecoin (PEP), a fork of Dogecoin and Litecoin. PEP is gaining momentum with potential listings on major exchanges like Kraken and XT, separating it from the Ethereum-based PEPE. The community is optimistic about its growth potential and utility compared to other meme coins. PEPE: The word 'Pepe' is trending due to the buzz around the name PEP (Pepecoin), a separate Layer 1 blockchain with proof of work. MSTR: The word 'Mstr' is trending due to significant financial and crypto-related activity involving MicroStrategy (MSTR).

2025-07-16T08:16:17,"Institutional demand and possible rate cut keep Bitcoin above $118k; check forecast","Bitcoin experienced a turbulent Tuesday as the price sank below $116k after hitting an all-time high on Monday. However, the market is currently in a recovery phase, with BTC adding 1% to its value in the last 24 hours to currently trade above $118k. Altcoins, including Ether, XRP, and Dogecoin, also recorded excellent gains in the last few hours as the total cryptocurrency market cap looks set to break above $4 trillion for the first time in history. Spot Bitcoin ETF inflow and possible rate cut push BTC above $118k Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market cap, is up 1% in the last 24 hours and now trades at $118,223. The positive performance came after BTC dropped to $115,627 on Tuesday. The ongoing recovery is fueled by growing institutional demand for Bitcoin products. Data obtained from SoSoValue revealed that U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds reported their ninth consecutive day of total net inflows on Tuesday, with $403 million moving into the funds. As usual, BlackRock’s IBIT led the gains, with net inflows of $416.35 million. In distant second is VanEck’s HODL reporting $19 million in positive flows while Grayscale’s Mini Bitcoin Trust and Bitwise’s BITB also recorded net inflows for the day. In addition to the institutional demand, yesterday’s CPI figures also fanned bullish sentiment across the broader cryptocurrency market. Core CPI rose just 0.1% month-over-month for the fifth straight time, signalling further disinflation. Traders are now predicting a September Fed rate cut following yesterday’s CPI data. Despite Bitcoin’s ongoing rally, analysts are still unsure of a breakout in the medium to long term. In an email, Andrejs Balans, risk manager, YouHodler (an EU-based fintech platform), pointed out that inflation in major economies remains persistently above target, prompting central banks to hold policy rates higher for longer. This tight monetary environment has limited liquidity across risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Balans said: Bitcoin’s market has matured considerably, with improved liquidity and participation by professional trading firms. This evolution has reduced volatility compared to past cycles, a sign of a more resilient market, but also a factor that can dampen large speculative moves. Following significant gains this year, many long-term holders have realized profits, thereby adding to the market’s supply. Without sustained fresh demand, this selling pressure could keep prices range-bound rather than driving a decisive breakout. BTC eyes $120k resistance level The BTC/USD 4-hour chart is bullish and efficient thanks to the cryptocurrency’s rally over the last few days. The coin tapped the 4H Transactional Liquidity (TLQ) level at $116k on Tuesday, prompting a rally above $118k. The technical indicators suggest a sustained rally, which could push BTC towards the $120k resistance level in the near term. The MACD lines remain within the positive zone, while the RSI of 58 shows that the bulls are yet to relinquish control of the market. In the event of an extended rally, BTC could surge past its all-time high of $123k over the next few hours or days. On the downside, failure to build momentum above the Bollinger mid-band of $118,200 could see BTC retest the first major support level at $115k. The bears could retest the second major support at $112,500 if the bearish trend continues, with an important trendline liquidity within that region.

Just as AI reshapes trading algorithms and smart contracts, it’s now fundamentally altering how we consume information. The latest development from the tech giant, Google, has sent ripples of concern across the publishing industry: the rollout of Google AI summaries in its popular Discover feed. This move, while seemingly innovative, poses a formidable challenge to news publishers already grappling with a severe publisher traffic decline , raising critical questions about the future of digital content distribution and monetization. Understanding the Shift in Google Discover News For years, Google Discover has served as a vital conduit for news organizations, delivering personalized content directly to users’ smartphones. It’s been a steady source of clicks, even as organic search traffic dwindled. However, the introduction of AI-generated summaries is poised to disrupt this delicate balance. Imagine opening your Google app on iOS or Android, expecting to see a compelling headline from your favorite news source. Instead, you’re greeted by a concise, AI-crafted summary, pulling information from multiple publishers, whose logos appear subtly in the corner. This new format aims to provide quick answers, but it fundamentally alters the user’s interaction with the news. Google’s implementation of these summaries isn’t a full-scale launch yet; it appears to be a test. Users will notice multiple news publishers’ logos in the top-left corner, followed by an AI-generated summary that cites those sources. A crucial disclaimer accompanies these summaries: they are “generated with AI, which can make mistakes.” This acknowledgment highlights the nascent stage of the technology and the potential for inaccuracies, a significant concern for publishers and readers alike. Bitcoin World observed these summaries firsthand across both iOS and Android apps in the U.S., confirming the ongoing rollout. Beyond the direct AI summaries, Google is experimenting with other ways to present Google Discover news . Some stories might feature bullet points summarizing content below the headline, while others are grouped with similar news, providing a broader context. For example, a story about a political development might include links to related articles, offering a more comprehensive view without requiring users to navigate away from the app. While these additions aren’t explicitly flagged as AI-powered, they contribute to a trend of condensing information within the Google ecosystem, further reducing the need for direct website visits. The Alarming Publisher Traffic Decline: Is AI the Culprit? The publishing industry has been vocal about its concerns regarding declining website traffic, and the advent of advanced AI features only amplifies these anxieties. The data paints a stark picture: global search traffic reportedly fell by 15% year-over-year as of June, according to market intelligence firm Similarweb. Even more concerning is the rise in “no-click” searches — instances where users find their answers directly on the search results page without visiting any website. This phenomenon surged from 56% in May 2024, when Google’s AI Overviews launched, to nearly 69% by May 2025. This shift isn’t exclusive to Google. Other AI applications, such as ChatGPT and Perplexity, similarly provide summarized information or chatbot-style interfaces, effectively becoming intermediaries between users and original content sources. For publishers, this means a significant reduction in organic traffic, which dropped from over 2.3 billion visits at its peak in mid-2024 to fewer than 1.7 billion. The core issue is clear: if users can get the gist of a story or an answer to a query directly from Google’s interface, the incentive to click through to the original publisher’s website diminishes drastically, leading directly to a severe publisher traffic decline . How is AI in News Being Embraced (and Feared) by Publishers? Despite the widespread concerns, many publishers are not sitting idly by. Major players like The Wall Street Journal, Yahoo, Bloomberg, and USA Today are actively experimenting with AI in news production and content delivery on their own platforms. These trials range from using AI for content generation and summarization to enhancing personalization and user engagement. Startups are also innovating in this space; for instance, Particle, a news reader, leverages AI not just for summarizing stories but also for allowing users to explore different perspectives or ask follow-up questions for deeper understanding. While these internal AI initiatives aim to keep publishers competitive and relevant, they exist against a backdrop of increasing apprehension. The very tools being adopted internally by some are simultaneously being deployed by platforms like Google in ways that threaten their core business model. The promise of AI for efficiency and enhanced user experience is undeniable, but its implementation by dominant tech platforms creates an existential dilemma for content creators who rely on direct engagement for revenue. Navigating Digital Publishing Challenges in an AI-Dominated World The landscape of digital publishing challenges is becoming increasingly complex. Google’s response to these industry-wide concerns includes initiatives like Offerwall, launched to provide publishers with alternative revenue streams beyond traditional, traffic-dependent advertising. Offerwall, integrated with Google Ad Manager, allows publishers to implement various access methods for their content, such as micropayments, surveys, or even requiring users to watch ads. This offers a glimmer of hope for diversification, but for many, it feels like too little, too late, as traffic losses continue to mount. The fundamental problem remains: the value chain is shifting. Content creators invest heavily in reporting, editing, and producing high-quality journalism, only for that content to be summarized and consumed on platforms that don’t directly contribute to their ad revenue or subscription base. This disintermediation is a profound challenge, forcing publishers to rethink their entire strategy, from content creation to audience engagement and monetization. The question is no longer just about adapting to digital, but adapting to an AI-first digital environment where direct traffic is no longer guaranteed. The Future of News Consumption and Monetization The trend of AI-powered summaries and “no-click” experiences suggests a future where information is increasingly consumed in fragmented, aggregated forms. While Google Discover previously remained a relatively stable source of clicks even as general Google Search traffic declined, the widespread rollout of AI summaries within the Google app could soon change that. This poses a significant threat to one of the last remaining reliable traffic channels for news publishers. For publishers, the path forward involves a multi-pronged approach: continuing to innovate with AI on their own platforms to enhance user experience and content creation, exploring diverse monetization models beyond traditional advertising, and advocating for fair compensation and attribution from major platforms that leverage their content. The battle for direct user engagement is intensifying, and the outcome will determine the sustainability of quality journalism in the age of artificial intelligence. The introduction of Google AI summaries in Discover marks a pivotal moment for the publishing industry. While Google aims to provide users with quicker access to information, this innovation comes at a potentially devastating cost for news publishers who rely on traffic for their very survival. The ongoing publisher traffic decline , exacerbated by features like AI Overviews, highlights the urgent need for new strategies and a re-evaluation of the relationship between tech giants and content creators. As AI in news continues to evolve, addressing these digital publishing challenges will be crucial for the future of informed societies.

2025-07-16T08:07:57,"“Jerome Powell’s Firing Is Imminent,” Claims Florida Rep. Anna Paulina Luna","The post “Jerome Powell’s Firing Is Imminent,” Claims Florida Rep. Anna Paulina Luna appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Since the start of Trump’s tenure, he has been vocal on interest rates , and on many occasions, he has put direct blame on Jerome Powell for acting too late on curbing inflation and reducing interest rates. In this context, a recent post on social media stirred up a wave of speculation that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell could be fired soon, but experts and markets say, not so fast. REP LUNA: 99% SURE JEROME POWELL IS GETTING FIRED Rep. Anna Paulina Luna says she’s “99% sure” Jerome Powell is about to be fired, doubling down after initially claiming she heard the news from “a very serious source.” Source: @realannapaulina https://t.co/s0a3UsDs4D pic.twitter.com/SucAAt8brQ — Mario Nawfal (@MarioNawfal) July 16, 2025 The Spark: A Bold Claim from Congresswoman Luna On July 16, Florida Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, in her X post, said that Powell’s firing is “imminent.” Although she gave no evidence to support her claim, her post was enough to move the needle on Polymarket, a crypto-based betting platform. Odds that Powell would be ousted jumped from 23% to 27%, though they quickly slipped back to 25% as the excitement wore off. Luna isn’t part of the House Financial Services Committee, the group that oversees the Fed, so her statement doesn’t carry much weight in official circles. She’s more known for her role on the Oversight and Natural Resources Committees. I heard from a very credible, bipartisan source, today, that Jerome Powell is considering resigning. This maps with both reports and also the talk in DC. — Pulte (@pulte) July 16, 2025 Notably, Bill Pulte, head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency and known Powell critic, also claimed he’d heard from a “very credible, bipartisan source” that Powell might resign soon, adding weight to Luna’s assertion. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Sandman warned that markets aren’t ready for such a shock. He noted that over 80% of market participants still expect Powell to complete his term, suggesting that investors are largely ignoring the scenario. So, Can Powell Be Fired? Removing the Fed Chair isn’t that simple. The Federal Reserve Act says a Fed governor can only be removed for serious issues like misconduct or failure to do their job, not just because someone disagrees with their policies. A Supreme Court ruling from 1935 (Humphreys’ Executor v. United States) reinforced the Fed’s independence by limiting presidential power to remove agency heads. Under current law, Fed governors can only be dismissed for inefficiency or neglect of duty, not policy disagreements. This legal power has stood the test of time and protects Powell, even under political pressure. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Week Recap: Bitcoin Surges as U.S. Debates Digital Asset Bills , However, President Donald Trump reportedly wanted Powell out during his first term, too, but even he didn’t follow through, likely because of these legal barriers. Meanwhile, interestingly, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed that a formal process to find Powell’s successor has already begun, hinting that a transition may come, just not as suddenly as some suggest. No Impact on Crypto or Stocks While some Polymarket bettors got briefly excited, the broader financial markets didn’t react much. Bitcoin didn’t budge, and the stock market showed no signs of concern. Traders appear confident that Powell’s leadership will remain intact, dismissing Luna’s post as speculative noise rather than a signal of real change. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In the context of the current discussion, the Realized Profit of two specific segments of the sector is of interest: short-term holders (STHs) and long-term holders (LTHs). Investors are divided into these groups based on the basis of holding time. More particularly, holders who have been carrying their coins for 155 days or less are put in the STHs and those who have made it past this threshold are considered LTHs. Below is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in the Realized Profit for the two sides of the Bitcoin market. As displayed in the graph, the Bitcoin Realized Profit has seen spikes for both of these groups during the last 24 hours, implying investors across the market have harvested gains taking advantage of the rally to the new all-time high (ATH) above $123,000. In total, the holders took profits equal to $3.5 billion inside this window, making the profit-taking event one of the largest for the year. Interestingly, the LTHs occupied for a higher share ($1.96 billion or 56%) of the profit realization than the STHs ($1.54 billion or 44%). Generally, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell them. As such, the LTHs with their relatively long holding time are considered to represent the resolute side of the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Returns Under $117,000: Is Social Media FOMO To Blame?

2025-07-16T08:00:00,"Bitlayer's BitVM Bridge Debuts Its Mainnet, Offers Trust-Minimized Bitcoin DeFi","Bitlayer's BitVM Bridge launched its mainnet on Wednesday, enabling bitcoin (BTC) liquidity for decentralized finance through a trust-minimized framework. The bridge keeps users' BTC safe by locking it in the BitVM smart contract that operates under the assumption that at least one honest market participant exists, ready to expose malicious attempts to move funds. This trust-minimized setup starkly contrasts traditional custodians that involve centralized custody or distributed custodianship. ""Over the past year, we've dedicated significant resources to developing the BitVM bridge, and we're thrilled to finally deliver this milestone to the community,"" Bitlayer co-founder, Kevin He said in a press release shared with CoinDesk. ""Post-mainnet deployment, our focus shifts to scaling asset compatibility and deepening integration with additional blockchain networks,"" He added. YBTC, a gateway to BTC DeFi Central to Bitlayer is YBTC, a token that directly represents the user's locked bitcoin. Its value is pegged 1:1 with BTC, and it opens decentralized finance to BTC holders looking to generate additional yield by allowing them to stake, lend, borrow, trade and provide liquidity across multi-chain decentralized exchanges. The token's security stems directly from the transparent and verifiable BitVM smart contract – unlike wrapped BTC (such as WBTC), which relies on a trusted central entity to hold the actual BTC. Note that YBTC is distinct from Bitlayer's native token, BTR, which is used for governance, fees and staking within the ecosystem and is slated to be listed on major centralized exchanges. Front-and-reclaim model Typically, eliminating centralized custodians implies longer waiting times, especially in the case of fraud-proof systems like Bitlayer. Here, while transactions are assumed to be honest, anyone watching can step in to prove if something went wrong. To allow enough time for these crucial security checks, there's a built-in waiting period, typically seven days, during which a fraudulent transaction could be challenged. This can lead to longer withdrawal times. However, Bitlayer employs an innovative ""front-and-reclaim"" model, transferring the waiting period to specialized brokers or third-party liquidity providers. These entities provide the withdrawn BTC from their own funds to users within approximately one hour. Meanwhile, they wait for their original seven-day security period to end before getting their funds back from the smart contract. This approach offers both trustless security and a fast, convenient user experience. ""There is a front mechanism in BitVM bridge design, the pegout user will get their BTC back at bitcoin block time,"" He told CoinDesk. ""The waiting time will be left to the broker(operator)."" Expansive ecosystem Bitlayer is prioritizing integration with the Ethereum mainnet and major layer 2 solutions, as well as exploring Solana and Bitcoin-native layer 2s, such as Lightning Network applications. It has already secured integration with other leading ecosystems, including Sui, Base, Starknet, and Arbitrum, Sonic, Plume Network and Sundial. ""Our goal is to make YBTC universally accessible wherever significant DeFi liquidity exists, enabling bitcoin to flow securely and seamlessly into diverse ecosystems,"" BitLayer's team told CoinDesk. The team added that it plans to establish a security committee, release audit reports and conduct bug bounties and open-source their code, creating a roadmap that positions BitLayer's BitVM Bridge as a crucial piece of infrastructure for BTC's future in DeFi.

As the week began on Monday, the announcement drew mixed reactions from the market, with Bitcoin trading activity increasing as investors expected possible regulatory updates. What Happened So Far in Crypto Week? U.S. President Hailed Crypto Week: On Tuesday, US President Donald Trump cheered, “Happy Crypto Week,” while urging the Republican House to vote in favor of what he calls “tremendous bills.” he reiterated that digital assets are the future of the US nation, and this could make the US the global leader. Trump stated, “This is our moment – Digital assets, GENIUS, clarity! It is all part of Making America Great Again, bigger and better than ever before. We are leading the world, and will work hard with the Senate and the House to get even more legislation on this passed!” The Bills Stalled: Republicans Joined Democrats After several hours, a bunch of Republicans joined the Democrats to prevent the legislation from coming to a vote or debate. Previously, Congress leaders, Maxine Waters and Stephen Lynch, announced “ anti-crypto corruption week ” to stop the US president’s nefarious intentions with digital assets in the name of legislation. At the time, they did not receive any support. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : “Jerome Powell’s Firing Is Imminent,” Claims Florida Rep.

Impact on Bitcoin Trade Crypto investors have been anticipating Bitcoin to hit new records as US lawmakers prepare to reinforce regulations in digital assets. Bitcoin trade indeed reached new records with trading above $120,000 on the first day of crypto week. Investors’ Confidence Boosted in Stablecoins The GENIUS Act is one of the major bills under consideration in crypto week.

Xu Han, the director of Liquid Fund at HashKey Capital, said this bill has boosted investors’ confidence in stablecoins while providing clarity. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!
