2025-07-16T05:55:57,"Jameson Lopp proposes that BTC owners avoid quantum-vulnerable addresses.","Jameson Lopp, CTO and co-founder of the self-custody platform Casa, along with five other developers, has proposed new strategies to counter the potential threat of quantum computing. Their proposal aims to steer Bitcoin holders to adopt more secure, quantum-resistant storage methods and implement additional protective measures. Quantum algorithms are a threat to Bitcoin’s cryptographic pillars Crypto experts say quantum computing could break Bitcoin’s encryption system. The network applies cryptographic security measures such as the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) to protect wallets and SHA-256 to confirm mining and transactions. Quantum algorithms, however, pose a threat to these systems. For example, Shor’s algorithm might allow attackers to solve the math underlying these protections, making it possible to expose a private key from a known public key. Many Pay-to-Public-Key (P2PK) and Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash (P2PKH) addresses are exposed, which puts an estimated 25% of Bitcoin’s total supply in danger, according to a Deloitte study. Furthermore, with identifiable public keys, Satoshi Nakamoto’s dormant wallets would also be vulnerable to quantum attacks . The same applies to another quantum algorithm that threatens the security of Bitcoin — Grover’s algorithm , which cuts the effective security of SHA-256 by 50%. In May, Lopp had cautioned that quantum signature schemes have become significantly larger, which could reopen debates about Bitcoin’s ability to handle high transaction volumes. He also warned that if a quantum computer could break the ECDSA pillar, it would be disastrous—stolen BTC will fill the markets, undermining trust and possibly triggering a price collapse. Experts have articulated that existing quantum computers cannot crack ECDSA now. Some anticipate that quantum computing will become a real threat in at least 10 years, seeing how engineers are still working on building fault-tolerant systems. However, some analysts believe Bitcoin could be in trouble in the next five years if quantum computers advance beyond expectations, an opinion many have brushed off as unlikely. Earlier, Lopp argued that while it’s not easy to estimate how long they have before quantum computing becomes a real threat, the Bitcoin community should collaborate to come up with solutions before it grows into an existential crisis. Lopp’s proposal would have BTC owners shift to post-quantum secure addresses Lopp had help from five other developers to draft the Bitcoin improvement plan. In the proposal, they iterated that Bitcoin is under threat, noting that a successful quantum attack would hurt economies and possibly the entire ecosystem. The proposal also details that miners would have to transfer funds to post-quantum secure addresses and restrict Bitcoin spending within five years. It stated: “It turns quantum security into a private incentive. Fail to upgrade [to a new address type] and you will certainly lose access to your funds.” Ideally, the plan includes incentives for Bitcoin owners who shift to more secure addresses. In his proposal, Lopp also references BIP 360, an upgrade created by Anduro’s Senior Protocol Engineer, Hunter Beast, to introduce address formats incorporating post-quantum cryptography at varying security levels. Other developers, such as Michael B. Casey, Director of Engineering at Marathon, have also contributed their own ideas to strengthen Bitcoin’s defenses. Casey introduced the hourglass narrative, dictating that vulnerable wallet types like pay-to-public-key reduce their number of transactions. He argued that fewer transactions would give the community time to look into other alternatives, at least delaying access to tokens to eight months from a few hours. He further noted that the move would cause hackers to target the older wallets that many people rarely use. Meanwhile, tech giants like Google and Microsoft have poured significant resources into advancing quantum computing.

2025-07-16T05:54:09,"Bad News Came Yesterday for the Three Major US Cryptocurrency Bills! Trump Intervened, Problem Solved! Crucial Vote Today! Here Are the Details","Cryptocurrency week in the US has started with negativity. Accordingly, cryptocurrency legislation that was expected to be voted on in the US House of Representatives this week has been postponed due to a procedural vote failure. In the vote held yesterday, the proposal, which would have paved the way for the discussion of three important cryptocurrency bills, was rejected with 223 “no” votes against 196 “yes” votes. Following the rejection decision, there was a positive development in laws that are of great importance to US President Donald Trump. Trump intervened and announced a meeting with House members who oppose the procedural agreement for the GENIUS Act. At this point, Trump said that an agreement had been reached to hold a vote again on July 16 and advance the stablecoin bill in the US. Donald Trump said on Truth Social that he met with 11 of the 12 people needed for the passage of the GENIUS Act in the Oval Office. According to Trump's post, the group agreed to vote on the morning of July 16. House Speaker Mike Johnson joined the meeting by phone and stated that he was ready to move forward with a vote as soon as possible. This update came after the House failed to hold a procedural vote on the bill. “I'm currently in the Oval Office at the White House with 11 of the 12 members of the House of Representatives whose approval is needed for passage of the GENIUS Act. After a brief discussion, they all agreed to vote yes tomorrow morning. I hope the vote will take place as soon as possible tomorrow. I extend my gratitude to the representatives for their prompt and positive response.” What Are These Laws? This week, dubbed “Crypto Week,” features two important bills on the House agenda: the National Innovation Guidelines and Establishment for U.S. Stablecoins Act (GENIUS) and the Digital Asset Market Openness Act (Clarity). The GENIUS law stipulates that stablecoin issuances must be fully collateralized only by US dollars or similar liquid assets, requires annual audits for issuers with a market capitalization over $50 billion, and establishes rules for overseas stablecoin issuance. The Clarity Act, meanwhile, aims to clarify the regulatory framework for crypto assets by offering a more comprehensive approach. It clarifies the roles and jurisdictions of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), as well as requiring digital asset service providers to notify individual investors and segregate client funds from company assets. *This is not investment advice.

Brandon Lutnick, the Chairman of Cantor Fitzgerald, is in “late-stage talks” with Back on a direct Bitcoin transfer deal, exceeding $3 billion, sources told the Financial Times . Cantor Equity Partners 1, a special-purpose acquisition company, would issue new shares to Back in exchange for 30,000 Bitcoin. Further, the company seeks to raise $800 million in outside capital for additional Bitcoin purchases, the report said.

Brandon Lutnick took over as chairman of Cantor Fitzgerald early this year, after his father, Howard Lutnick, joined the Trump administration as commerce secretary. Cantor’s combined SPAC, BSTR Holdings and Twenty One Capital, could accumulate nearly $10 billion in Bitcoin this year. Additionally, in the Cantor-Blockstream deal, the investment banking giant would partner with one of the crypto industry’s earliest supporters – Adam Back. Back, who has long championed institutional adoption as a path to “hyperbitcoinization,” has personally funded several Bitcoin-focused companies. In June, he funded a $15 million convertible bond for Swedish health technology and bitcoin treasury company H100 Group, which has plans to stockpile Bitcoin . Crypto Investors Turn to SPAC or Reverse Mergers Several crypto investors are turning to SPACs to publicly list their crypto ventures. Recently, Trump’s crypto adviser, David Bailey-led Nakamoto Holdings announced that it had raised $51.5 million for its own Bitcoin treasury firm, which it plans to take public via merger with KindlyMD. Last month, Anthony Pompliano announced a $1 billion business merger to create a Bitcoin-native firm, ProCap Financial. The company will go public through a SPAC with Columbus Circle Capital Corp. If completed, the Cantor SPAC deal would become the latest in a series of high-profile deals to buy Bitcoin.

On Wednesday, the Nasdaq-listed company purchased 6,377 ETH , worth about $19.56m at current prices. That brings SharpLink’s total to nearly 312,000 ETH, valued at roughly $974m, based on Wednesday’s price of $3,122.98 per coin. The latest buy follows a 24,371 ETH purchase made on July 15, a $73m outlay. Between July 7 and July 13, SharpLink picked up another 74,656 ETH for $213m , averaging $2,852 per coin. SharpLink Buys 10K ETH Directly From Ethereum Foundation In one of the most notable transactions, the company directly acquired 10,000 ETH from the Ethereum Foundation. SharpLink( @SharpLinkGaming ) bought another 6,377 $ETH ($19.56M) today. In the past 7 days, they've accumulated 91,330 $ETH ($275M). https://t.co/8pOfvpDWym pic.twitter.com/NGepBvYcP4 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 16, 2025 Since late May, SharpLink has been accumulating Ethereum in large batches, often moving funds on-chain through major centralized exchanges and over-the-counter addresses. This deliberate strategy suggests a long-term view, possibly tied to expectations of major price moves or upcoming upgrades to the Ethereum protocol. The company’s pivot into Ethereum marks a strategic shift. While it remains focused on its core business in sports betting and iGaming, SharpLink is now using ETH as its primary treasury reserve asset. That decision came after a $425m private placement led by Consensys, with participation from Pantera Capital, Electric Capital and ParaFi Capital. The move was first announced on May 27, 2025. SharpLink Nears Ethereum Foundation in Holdings Size CEO Rob Phythian has framed the acquisitions as a defining moment for public company engagement with crypto. He said over 99% of SharpLink’s Ethereum holdings are staked or restaked in protocols to generate yield while supporting the security of the Ethereum network. Ethereum co-founder and Consensys CEO Joseph Lubin, who now chairs SharpLink’s board, has described the firm’s strategy as a public-market proxy for Ethereum exposure, similar to MicroStrategy’s approach with Bitcoin. Lubin emphasized Ethereum’s importance for decentralized applications and digital commerce, pointing to favorable U.S. legislation as a major tailwind. With its daily buying spree showing no signs of slowing, SharpLink could soon overtake the Ethereum Foundation itself, which currently holds around $725m worth of ETH. The company’s positioning reflects a broader trend, as corporations increasingly look beyond Bitcoin and toward Ethereum as a programmable, yield-bearing asset. Investors are taking notice. SharpLink’s stock was up more than 14% in pre-market trading on Wednesday.

2025-07-16T05:15:17,"Crypto Legislation Faces Delay Amid GOP Disagreements, But New Vote Scheduled for Wednesday","Efforts to advance three major crypto-related bills in the U.S. House hit a roadblock on Tuesday, as internal disagreements among Republican lawmakers forced a pause on a key procedural vote. At the heart of the dispute is a push by some members of the GOP to include a ban on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) in the legislation. House Speaker Mike Johnson said he is hopeful the House will attempt to pass a procedural vote on Wednesday. “It’s a priority of the White House, the Senate and the House to do all of these crypto bills,” he stated, as reported by Politico. Disagreements on Strategy and Bill Structure The package includes the GENIUS Act, aimed at regulating stablecoins, along with the Anti-CBDC Surveillance Act, and the CLARITY Act, which proposes a new market framework for crypto assets. Some Republicans have argued that the bills should be bundled into one, but Speaker Johnson pushed back, warning the Senate would not approve such a move. “We have to do them in succession,” Johnson reportedly said. This legislative push is part of the Republican-led “Crypto Week,” intended to pass meaningful crypto regulation before Congress adjourns for a month-long break in August. In response, Democrats have dubbed the effort “anti-crypto corruption week” to express their opposition. CBDC Concerns Drive Republican Resistance Tensions escalated on Tuesday when 13 Republicans, including House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, voted against considering the bills. Among those dissenting were lawmakers such as Marjorie Taylor Greene, Andy Biggs, and Victoria Spartz. Several lawmakers took to X to clarify that they weren’t opposed to crypto regulations in general, but refused to support the GENIUS Act without an explicit CBDC ban. “I just voted NO on the Rule for the GENIUS Act because it does not include a ban on central bank digital currency and because Speaker Johnson did not allow us to submit amendments,” Greene said. Biggs echoed the sentiment, warning that the current version of the bill could allow for a layered CBDC and lacked guarantees for self-custody. “House Leadership must allow an open amendment process so Members can freely debate and improve the bill,” he added. Past and Future of the GENIUS Act The GENIUS Act had previously failed its first Senate vote in May due to Democratic concerns about Donald Trump’s involvement in crypto. It eventually passed in June with bipartisan support. Custodia Bank CEO Caitlin Long urged calm after Tuesday’s delay, noting that the Senate also required a second vote to move forward on the GENIUS Act. “BEFORE Y’ALL FREAK OUT, don’t forget that the first procedural vote in the Senate on the GENIUS Act failed as well…the second one passed 11 days later,” she wrote on X. Eleanor Terrett, host of the Crypto in America podcast, argued that the current bill already restricts the Federal Reserve from creating a retail CBDC. Speaker Johnson Continues Talks According to ABC News, Speaker Johnson is continuing discussions with Republican holdouts. However, one of the main sticking points remains whether the three bills should be passed together or separately. “They want to push that and merge them together,” Johnson said. “We’re trying to work with the White House and with our Senate partners on this.” The House is scheduled to reconvene on Wednesday to resume its legislative work.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/crypto-legislation-faces-delay-amid-gop-disagreements-but-new-vote-scheduled-for-wednesday/,"REGULATION|FIAT|BTC|MARKET","Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence",cryptocompare

As a result, several metrics now indicate renewed interest from both long-term holders and recent participants. Older Bitcoin Moves Amidst High Profit-Taking According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Kripto Mevsimi, Bitcoin’s Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) has surged significantly over the past week. The metric climbed to 28 million, signalling that older BTC – dormant for extended periods – has begun moving again. For the uninitiated, Bitcoin CDD measures the movement of older coins by multiplying the number of coins moved by how long they were held. A spike in CDD indicates that long-dormant Bitcoin is being spent or transferred, often signaling strategic shifts by long-term holders. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Ahead? DXY Breakdown Suggests Capital Shift To Risk-On Assets Historical data shows that CDD spikes typically precede strategic shifts – often large holders either redistributing supply or repositioning portfolios. Such activity commonly appears near cycle midpoints or local tops. Besides the rising CDD, Bitcoin Net Realized Profit and Loss (NRPL) has also recorded a steep climb. The metric recently surged past $4 billion, the highest level since Q2 2025. To explain, Bitcoin NRPL measures the difference between the price at which coins were bought and the price at which they are sold or moved on-chain. A high positive NRPL indicates investors are realizing profits, while a negative NRPL suggests widespread selling at a loss, often tied to market fear or capitulation. As NRPL hits levels not seen since early Q2 2025, it suggests that Bitcoin whales and recent buyers are actively taking profits. Despite the increased profit-taking, BTC’s price has remained relatively stable, trading between $116,000 and $120,000. The lack of a sharp price pullback amid such profit-taking points to two possible scenarios – either demand remains strong enough to absorb sell pressure, or a delayed correction could be on the horizon. The analyst noted: Interestingly, this current wave differs from late June. Back then, NRPL showed a mix of realized losses and modest profits – suggesting capitulation from late buyers while older holders quietly accumulated. Today, the narrative flips: profits dominate, while older coins flow. Exchange Data Suggests Warning For BTC While the absence of a sharp decline despite significant realized profits may signal strong underlying demand, recent exchange data raises some concerns. Notably, Bitcoin inflows to crypto exchanges have seen a sharp uptick. Related Reading: Bitcoin Absorbs Strong Selling Pressure On Binance Derivatives – Breakout Ahead? Conversely, other sentiment-tracking indicators suggest that despite BTC’s new highs, retail hype remains subdued – unlike in previous ATH phases – implying potential for further upside. At press time, BTC trades at $116,760, down 2.6% in the past 24 hours.

2025-07-16T05:00:16,"BlockDAG’s $0.0016 Countdown Is On Before GLOBAL LAUNCH Release, As Pi Network Holds and ICP’s Caffeine Launch Stirs Buzz","The Pi network price has dropped from $0.52 to about $0.45 but remains steady above a key support zone. This sideways move has people wondering if it’s gathering strength. A push past $0.60 could flip the story, hinting at a run toward $1. Meanwhile, new ICP news shows Internet Computer climbing nearly 4% just before launching its Caffeine platform, which could change how people build Web3 apps. BlockDAG is drawing more eyes as its GLOBAL LAUNCH release date gets closer. The presale price of $0.0016 is still live, but not for long. While Pi holds its ground and ICP builds slowly, BlockDAG ’s presale has already crossed $339 million, with 23.9 billion coins sold. Some are already calling it one of the next top crypto gainers, especially if the $1 prediction becomes a reality. What’s Next for Pi Network Price After Recent Drop? The Pi network price recently fell to $0.45 from a high of $0.52, but it hasn’t broken below $0.40. That’s a level analysts say is important. With 276 million PI coins unlocked between late June and mid-July, pressure remains. Still, lower volume hints that the worst may be over. Dr. Altcoin believes that if supply levels off by August, Pi network price could begin a recovery. A move above $0.60 might push it toward $1. In the background, developers are still building real-world tools that could boost long-term relevance. ICP News Highlights Caffeine’s Launch and Market Reaction The latest ICP news reveals a 4% price jump, putting Internet Computer at $5.48 just as it prepares to release its Caffeine platform. This AI-driven tool will let users create Web3 apps by simply explaining what they want in plain language. That request is turned into working smart contracts, launched directly on the blockchain. ICP news outlets report strong volume and higher lows, suggesting momentum is building. With the July 15 launch in San Francisco approaching, this could be one of the more notable shifts in the Web3 space right now. BlockDAG Builds Pressure Ahead of GLOBAL LAUNCH Release The clock is ticking on BlockDAG’s limited $0.0016 presale as its GLOBAL LAUNCH release approaches on August 11. Demand is rising quickly, with more people trying to secure coins before the price moves up. So far, BlockDAG has raised more than $339 million and sold over 23.9 billion coins across 29 batches. The price has climbed 2,660% since batch one, starting at $0.001 and now sitting at $0.0276, yet the $0.0016 offer remains available for a short time. Analysts note that confidence in BDAG comes from its hybrid design, combining Bitcoin’s Proof of Work security with the scale of Directed Acyclic Graph technology. Its growing community is also hard to ignore, with more than two million people using the mobile miner and over 200,000 unique holders. These signs, paired with the size of the presale, have led to talk that BDAG could reach $1 in the months after launch. Now showing up in talk around the top crypto gainers, BlockDAG’s rising demand and tight supply have made the current price feel more urgent. The $0.0016 point may not last much longer, and with its mix of traction and tools, the project is drawing attention for all the right reasons. Final Takeaway These three names are all moving, but in different ways. The Pi network price is holding steady under pressure, and many are waiting to see if that support can lead to recovery. The latest ICP news reflects steady progress, especially with Caffeine adding momentum to Internet Computer’s platform. BlockDAG, on the other hand, is moving quickly. With the GLOBAL LAUNCH release now just weeks away and the $0.0016 entry window closing fast, it has already pulled in major attention. If things play out as predicted, BlockDAG could be one of the top crypto gainers this cycle. And once that window shuts, it may not reopen.

2025-07-16T04:47:38,"Polymarket Odds on Jerome Powell's Ouster Jumps as Congresswoman Says It's 'Imminent'","A Florida Congresswoman's post on X has moved the market for bettors looking to speculate on the firing of Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell. Anna Paulina Luna (R- Florida) claimed on the social media site that Powell's firing was 'imminent', but provided no further details, moving the 'yes' side of a related contract on Polymarket by 4 % up to 27%. Luna does not serve on the House Financial Services Committee , which oversees the Federal Reserve. The Florida 13th district representative serves on the House Oversight and Accountability Committee and Natural Resources Committee, and is a member of the House Freedom Caucus and Congressional Second Amendment Caucus. President Trump has long wished to remove Jerome Powell, dating back to his first administration , but there would be significant legal challenges to removing him. In 2019, the Brookings Institution prepared an analysis highlighting the 1935 Supreme Court case Humphreys' Executor v. United States , which blocked President Franklin Roosevelt from removing an FTC commissioner, as a key precedent supporting the Federal Reserve Act’s “for cause” removal protections. The law, as it stands, only permits the removal of Fed governors only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office, not policy disagreements. And perhaps that has resonated with Polymarket bettors. In the hours since Rep. Luna's post on X, the odds on the 'Yes' side have come back down to 25%. Bitcoin traders dismissed the possibility entirely of Powell's removal, with BTC staying flat.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/07/16/polymarket-odds-on-jerome-powells-ouster-jumps-as-congresswoman-says-its-imminent,"REGULATION|FIAT|BTC|MARKET","Policy|Jerome Powell|Donald Trump|Federal Reserve|Polymarket|News",cryptocompare
2025-07-16T04:45:27,"14-Year Dormant Wallet Dumps 20K BTC, Stoking Correction Worries","A Bitcoin (BTC) wallet holding over 80,000 BTC, untouched for more than 14 years, has sprung to life, liquidating 20,000 BTC worth $2.4 billion and transferring billions more to institutional custodian Galaxy Digital. The sudden movement of these ancient coins, originating from Bitcoin’s earliest days, has sent ripples of anxiety through the market, drawing stark parallels to the Mt. Gox trustee wallet reactivations in 2024 that preceded a brutal 31% BTC price correction. Strategic Moves from a Bitcoin Pioneer According to Lookonchain, the Bitcoin OG controlled eight wallets. Two received 20,000 BTC on April 2, 2011, while the other six received 60,009 BTC on May 4, 2011. Four addresses woke up on July 4, 2025, transferring 40,000 BTC. Several hours later, the other wallets also stirred to life, moving 20,000 BTC, priced at about $2.17 billion, to a new location. Then, on July 14, after a short period of quiet, the ancient hodler moved 40,009 BTC worth some $4.68 billion to Galaxy Digital, over several hours, with the platform funneling some of these funds directly into Binance and Bybit. It confirmed the whale’s intention to at least sell portions of the stash, moving beyond initial speculation about mere wallet consolidation or security upgrades. Given the sheer scale of the transactions, pseudonymous CryptoQuant analyst OnChainSchool has compared them to the Mt. Gox wallet reactivations in 2024. When the defunct exchange’s trustee began moving BTC last year, it caused the flagship cryptocurrency to lose 31% of its value in the weeks following the dump, and more than six months to recover. The current whale activity shares a few similarities: massive volume, long dormancy, and action near an ATH, fueling speculation that it could trigger a similar correction. “So far, only a portion of the holdings has been sold,” wrote OnChainSchool. “Whether the outcome will be similar this time remains uncertain, but the parallels are worth noting.” Market Jitters vs. Historical Context However, there are also a few key differences. For one, this sell-off is being managed professionally via Galaxy Digital, suggesting a more controlled distribution. Furthermore, according to investor Daan Crypto Trades, such events often generate exaggerated fears that tend to dissipate way before the actual selling concludes. The trader also referenced the sale last summer by the German government of 50,000 BTC for about $2.5 billion, where the market absorbed the pressure over time. While the historic wallet’s potential overhang is up to 80,000 BTC, valued at around $9.46 billion, the institutional and OTC demand right now is arguably stronger than it was last year, giving a glimmer of hope that the supply can be absorbed without ruffling the market too much. Meanwhile, Bitcoin, which celebrated a new all-time high of over $123,000 on Monday, per CoinMarketCap, has retraced a bit. At the time of this writing, the asset was trading around $117,500, reflecting a 4% since the peak. The dip interrupts a commendable weekly performance that saw its value jump 7.5% and a monthly gain of more than 11%.

2025-07-16T04:23:07,"Best BTC alternatives this summer? This crypto could 10x","Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a non-custodial, DeFi-native lending protocol built to serve both passive earners and active traders. But what makes it stand out are its mtTokens—yield-bearing ERC-20 tokens designed to capture both deposit value and interest. Investors looking to generate stable, long-term income on blue-chip assets like ETH, SOL, or USDC are beginning to recognize Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a serious alternative to stagnant large caps. Earning yield with mtTokens while holding blue-chips Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s Pool-to-Contract (P2C) system will allow users to lend top-tier tokens like SOL, USDT, and ETH into decentralized smart contract pools. In exchange, lenders receive mtTokens, which represent the original deposit and automatically grow in value over time as interest is earned. These mtTokens will also be eligible for staking in smart contracts, unlocking compound rewards sourced from protocol revenue. Here’s a real example: a user deposits 60 SOL (roughly $10,000) into a lending pool earning 8.2% APY. That generates around $820 per year, passively, through mtSOL that increases in value the longer it’s held. Once staked in the platform’s upcoming smart contracts, that same mtSOL could begin earning MUTM dividends, giving lenders two parallel income streams while still retaining exposure to the original SOL asset. This model is turning heads because it solves two pain points in one go: holding blue-chip tokens without watching them sit idle, and doing it all in a non-custodial, automated way. No active trading required. No complex LP positions. Just smart contracts working behind the scenes. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s roadmap is also designed for long-term sustainability. The protocol uses dynamic interest rate adjustments based on pool utilization, ensuring lender returns increase as more borrowing occurs. And because all funds are overcollateralized and auto-liquidated if thresholds are breached, the system is designed to maintain solvency at every step. Custom loan deals with higher returns and direct control For those seeking higher returns—and willing to take on more risk—Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending engine offers a second, fully customizable option. In this model, users don’t interact with shared pools. Instead, lenders and borrowers connect directly and negotiate their own terms. One user might lend 2,000 USDC to a borrower who posts SHIB as collateral. The lender agrees to a 14% interest rate, a 20-day repayment window, and a 72% loan-to-value ratio. That short-term deal delivers $280 in profit within three weeks, enforced by smart contracts and isolated from the rest of the ecosystem. Since there’s no pooled liquidity involved, the lender isn’t exposed to systemic contagion. Each loan lives in its own container, and each party sets the risk they’re comfortable with. To keep the protocol stable, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) uses a mechanism called the Stability Factor—a dynamic adjustment system that tracks collateral volatility and triggers liquidation if it drops below safe margins. This way, even high-risk meme tokens like PEPE, DOGE, or SHIB are handled responsibly, without putting the broader ecosystem in danger. Presale momentum building as listing approaches Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently deep into Phase 5 of its presale, with over 75% of the round sold out. More than 13,300 holders have already joined the community, and over $12.35 million has been raised so far. The token is now priced at $0.03, but that price will climb by 20% in Phase 6, bringing it to $0.035, and the final listing price is already confirmed at $0.06. That’s why presale buyers are moving quickly. A SOL holder who swapped $15,000 into MUTM during Phase 1 at just $0.01 per token now sits on $45,000 in value as the presale enters Phase 5 at $0.03. And with the token preparing to list at $0.06, that same portfolio is projected to hit $90,000—a 6x return in under 6 months. It’s not hype fueling this growth, but real fundamentals: on-chain yield, a functioning DeFi product suite, and a roadmap featuring Layer-2 scaling, stablecoin mechanics, and institutional partnerships. Security is also front and center. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has partnered with CertiK for audits and is running a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program to catch vulnerabilities before launch. To grow awareness, a $100,000 giveaway is underway, offering $10,000 worth of tokens each to 10 lucky winners. With over 12,000 followers on X and daily engagement climbing, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s momentum is now hard to ignore. Final word The DeFi market is waking up, and tokens with real-world use cases are rising to the top. While BTC idles and speculation burns out, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building something fundamentally different—a way to earn from your assets without giving up control. Whether you’re holding stablecoins, SOL, or meme tokens, the platform is built to work for you—not the other way around. Phase 5 is closing fast. Don’t miss your shot at one of the last high-utility tokens still priced under $0.05.

2025-07-16T04:00:07,"Ethereum Treasury Adoption Booms: 550,000 ETH Acquired By Corporates In A Month","As the crypto market continues its upward trajectory – with total market capitalization briefly surpassing $3.8 trillion yesterday – institutional interest in Ethereum (ETH) has grown increasingly evident. A growing number of corporations are now accumulating ETH at an unprecedented pace. Ethereum Demand Showing No Signs Of Exhaustion According to an X post by crypto entrepreneur Kyle Reidhead, current demand for ETH has been “insane.” Specifically, ten Ethereum treasury firms have collectively accumulated more than 550,000 ETH – worth approximately $1.65 billion – over the past 30 days. Reidhead emphasized that this momentum is accelerating, with no signs of slowing. He noted that new ETH treasury companies are launching every week, and the largest of these may not have entered the market yet. Moreover, each of these companies is reportedly aiming to buy more ETH than they did the previous week. If this trend continues, ETH purchases could hit $2 billion in the next month, and potentially $3 billion the month after. While this demand will inevitably taper off at some point, it appears unlikely to do so in the near term. In particular, stablecoin supply growth and favorable digital asset regulations could further encourage companies to add crypto to their balance sheets. It’s worth noting that the week beginning July 14 marks “ Crypto Week ” in the US, during which three major digital asset bills are expected to face congressional votes. These bills focus on key issues like stablecoin regulation and the potential use of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) in monetary policy. ETH To Face Supply Shock? Reidhead added that in the past 30 days, ETH treasury firms have bagged as much as 0.5% of the total circulating ETH supply. These firms have also moved ETH into Ethereum decentralized finance (DeFi) contracts through staking or lending. The entrepreneur also drew a contrast between treasury buyers and Ethereum ETFs, stating that unlike ETFs, these treasury firms do not sell. Instead, they appear committed to accumulating and holding ETH long-term. He remarked: This is going to create a supply shock for ETH over the coming months, there’s really no way around it. Fade ETH and the treasury companies at your own caution. Supporting this thesis, data from SoSoValue shows that spot ETH ETFs have enjoyed nine consecutive weeks of positive inflows, with $907 million added in the week ending July 11. As of July 15, spot ETH ETFs have already received $259 million in fresh inflows. Another data point that strengthens the argument for a looming ETH supply shock is the rapidly depleting exchange reserves. That said, some caution is warranted .

2025-07-16T03:30:25,"Bitcoin OG Whale Moves 40,000 BTC To Galaxy, Triggering Market Shock","A single wallet that has sat untouched since 2011 jolted the market overnight, wiring 40,009 BTC—worth roughly $4.68 billion at prevailing prices—to New York‑based trading giant Galaxy Digital. The address had held 80,009 BTC in total and had never previously moved funds in the modern era. According to on‑chain sleuth Lookonchain, “the Bitcoin OG with 80,009 BTC ($9.46 B) has transferred 40,009 BTC ($4.68 B) to Galaxy Digital,” and Galaxy “has directly deposited 6,000 BTC ($706 M) into Binance and Bybit.” Bitcoin OG Whale Awakens The activity began late Monday evening (UTC). First, 9,000 BTC—about $1.06 billion—left the dormant wallet, followed an hour later by another 7,843 BTC ($927 million) Over the next five hours several smaller tranches arrived at Galaxy Digital’s custodial accounts before the decisive push that brought the running total to 40,009 BTC. Blockchain explorers show the coins originated from a bech32 address that first received block rewards in early 2011, when bitcoin changed hands for less than one US dollar. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Trajectory To $155,000: Why No Major Dips Are Expected From Here Notably, Galaxy Digital operates one of the largest over‑the‑counter (OTC) desks in the industry and regularly intermediates block trades for institutions seeking to avoid slippage on public venues. The firm advertises “premier execution” and bespoke liquidity provisioning for trades that are too large for order‑book execution. On‑chain analysts therefore read the wallet’s choice of counterparty as a signal that the owner intends to liquidate at least part of the hoard discreetly rather than deploy it into DeFi or cold storage. Within hours of receiving the coins, Galaxy split 6,000 BTC between Binance and Bybit, the two venues that currently post the deepest spot‑BTC liquidity. Bitcoin had just printed an all‑time high of $123,153 on 14 July, buoyed by Washington’s “Crypto Week” legislative push. As the OG whale’s transactions hit public mempools, spot prices recoiled more than 6%, sliding from $123,000 to an intraday low near $115,700 before stabilising around $116,900 at press time. Related Reading: The Bitcoin Liquidity Supercycle Has Just Begun, Says Hedge Fund CEO With half of the stash now under Galaxy’s control and only a fraction confirmed as exchange deposits, traders are bracing for further transfers. If Galaxy executes an OTC cross, the impact could be muted; if the coins bleed into order books, bids at $112,000‑$115,000 will face a major test. US Inflation Data Dampens Sentiment However, today’s price drop can not solely be attributed to the OG whale’s doing; it coincided with the US Bureau of Labor Statistics’ June CPI print, which showed headline consumer prices rising 0.3 % month‑on‑month and 2.7 % year‑on‑year—up from 2.4 % in May—while core CPI ticked up 0.2 % on the month and 2.9 % on the year. The modest print pushed the dollar index above 95.5, and risk assets have been whipsawing ever since. “The price action on the dollar pretty much tells you everything you need to know about this CPI report—mixed and the market is trying to digest it and to figure out the direction today,” observed Daan Crypto Trades on X. At press time, BTC stood at $116,972.

2025-07-16T02:03:06,"The Node: Stablecoin Supremacy","The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, wrote a letter to the G20 yesterday stating that the Financial Stability Board (FSB) — the forum’s financial overseer, which Bailey was appointed to head in April — is assessing the role of stablecoins in payments and settlements as a top priority. To the point: an analyst at Standard Chartered says that, once stablecoins hit the $750 billion mark, they may begin to influence the structure of U.S. Treasury markets. (Their market cap is currently at roughly $258 billion according to DefiLlama.) We also have Deribit making it possible for USDC holders to earn 4% yield, a crypto startup called Dakota raising $12.5 million to make it easier for businesses to move funds from U.S. dollars to stablecoins, and back again. These four headlines are all from today, and they’re nothing out of the ordinary. We are used to seeing an abundance of news, every day, about stablecoin adoption. “Stablecoins are crypto’s killer app” has become a motto almost akin to “stay humble, stack sats.” The underdiscussed winners of the stablecoin growth are market makers — the outfits that provide liquidity to crypto markets and ensure trades are executed efficiently. Kevin de Patoul, CEO of global investment firm Keyrock , recently told CoinDesk that demand for bitcoin and stablecoins outshined demand for any other type of cryptocurrencies by a wide margin. Even more interesting, demand for stablecoins is increasingly coming from companies that aren’t crypto native, but consider stablecoins as a genuinely superior technology for international payments. “That’s really been a change over the last year and a half, seeing those assets being used for their superior efficiency, rather than simply a way to gain exposure to crypto,” he said. Stablecoins will show the way for the tokenization of stocks , money market funds , and other, stranger types of financial products . De Patoul expects the financial system’s backend will be completely updated to improve user access to these vehicles. While tokenization is a bit of a newer and shinier concept for crypto natives — a little more like bleeding edge tech — stablecoins, with their “mind-boggling” potential, will likely remain the bigger story for years to come, De Patoul said. “Eventually, 50% of global payments are going to be made in stablecoins,” he said. “Stablecoins are going to continue to be the biggest use case for digital assets for the next few years.”",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/07/15/the-node-stablecoin-supremacy,"MARKET|BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY","Opinion|Stablecoins|Keyrock|Opinion",cryptocompare
2025-07-16T02:02:00,"Crypto price predictions: THENA, Aevo, Morpho","The cryptocurrency market wavered on Wednesday, with Bitcoin remaining below the key resistance level at $120,000. This price action occurred after the US released its latest consumer inflation data. This article explores the top crypto forecasts on THENA, Aevo, and Morpho. THENA price prediction THENA, the third-largest cryptocurrency on the BNB Chain, experienced a parabolic surge this week, making it one of the best-performing tokens of the week. It surged to a high of $0.6255, its highest level since March 2nd and nearly 200% above its lowest point this year. THENA token jumped as its network volume soared to over $30 million in the last 24 hours and $628 million in the last 30. It also happened after the CEO made some major announcements, including plans to onboard liquidity pools for blue-chip assets and stablecoins, pushing new proposals for the VENUS deal, and LP onboarding with Solv Finance. THENA price soared after it formed a double-bottom pattern at $0.2095, its lowest swing in April and June. This pattern is one of the most popular signs in technical analysis. THENA has moved above the important resistance at $0.4040, its highest point in May and the neckline of the double-bottom pattern. The most likely scenario is where the THENA price pulls back and retests the support at $0.4040. THENA price chart | Source: TradingView Aevo price analysis Aevo is a top player in the crypto industry, offering a platform to trade options and perpetual futures. It has over $35 million in total value locked, and handled perpetual futures volume worth over $123 million in June. It recently launched Aevo Degen, offering 1000x leverage on stocks and crypto. The daily chart shows that the Aevo price double-bottomed at $0.07595 an then bounced back to the current $0.1200. This is one of the most bullish reversal patterns in technical analysis. The token is about to form a mini golden cross as the 50-day and 25-day moving averages cross each other. Oscillators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the MACD have all pointed upwards. Therefore, the Aevo token will likely keep rising as bulls target the neckline at $0.1600. A move above that level will indicate further gains, potentially reaching $0.20. Aevo price chart | Source: TradingView Morpho price analysis Morpho is the biggest player in the Base blockchain with over $1.4 billion in total value locked. It is an AAVE rival enabling users to borrow money and earn interest. It is best known for its partnership with Coinbase , one of the biggest crypto exchanges in the industry. Morpho crypto price went parabolic this week, reaching a high of $2.1283, its highest level since March 3 and slightly below the 78.6% Fibonacci Retracement level. The token moved above the key resistance level at $1.7735, the highest swing in March this year. It has moved above the 50-day moving average. Morpho price chart | Source: TradingView Therefore, the token will likely resume its downtrend and retest the support at $1.7735, after which it will likely resume its uptrend. Ultimately, the token will then rebound and retest the year-to-date high of $2.5.
