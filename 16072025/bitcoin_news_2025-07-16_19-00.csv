2025-07-16T16:55:42,"Analyst Kevin Svenson Says Bitcoin Now Entering Vertical Stage of BTC Bull Market – Here Are His Price Targets","Cryptocurrency analyst and trader Kevin Svenson believes Bitcoin ( BTC ) is now poised to ignite steep rallies with shallow pullbacks. In a new strategy session, Svenson tells his 83,500 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin will likely print new all-time high prices as it launches the final phase of its parabolic advance. While Svenson believes that rallies are in sight for BTC, he cautions that a sharp correction may follow the next leg up. “We are now entering the vertical stage, where most likely the price is going to be sending up toward levels like $140,000 – $150,000 is my estimated range for the next top zone to come in before a break of the parabolic trend. And unlike the textbook diagram where it’s a straight line, that’s of course not how it goes. It’s not going to be a straight line up. There’s going to be chop, volatility all along the way on our way to those higher levels. Maybe around October, we’ll be seeing $140,000 – $150,000 for Bitcoin.” Source: Kevin Svenson/YouTube Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that Bitcoin is now escaping base four of the parabolic curve pattern – a phase where BTC will likely witness a blow-off rally before a parabolic burst.

2025-07-16T16:30:25,"Ripple Joins Forces with Ctrl Alt For Middle East Custody Push","Ripple has announced a strategic partnership with Ctrl Alt, a tokenization infrastructure provider, marking a significant expansion of its institutional digital asset custody services into the United Arab Emirates. The collaboration aims to power the Dubai Land Department’s (DLD) Real Estate Tokenization Project, which will issue tokenized property title deeds on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). Ripple Joins Forces With Ctrl Alt According to the official statement today, Ctrl Alt will leverage Ripple’s institutional-grade custody technology to provide secure and scalable storage for digital assets linked to Dubai’s pioneering real estate tokenization effort. Reece Merrick, Ripple’s Managing Director for the Middle East and Africa, highlighted the importance of this initiative, calling it “a perfect example of the type of forward-thinking, innovative initiative that is positioning Dubai at the heart of the global digital asset industry.” Merrick emphasized the significance of the project, noting, “This is the first time a government real estate registration authority in the Middle East has tokenized property title deeds on a public blockchain. That the DLD has chosen the XRPL for this is really exciting and reinforces the XRPL’s credentials as the blockchain of choice for serious financial use cases.” Ctrl Alt’s role as the designated tokenization provider for the DLD project is further strengthened by its recent regulatory milestone. The firm secured a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license from Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), becoming the first VASP authorized to conduct Issuer-related services in the UAE. This development establishes a compliant framework for real-world asset tokenization, covering issuance, custody, on-chain settlement, and lifecycle management. Matt Ong, CEO and Founder of Ctrl Alt, said, “Partnering with Ripple allows us to leverage proven and trusted technology that meets the highest security and operational standards. We’re excited to work with them and bring Dubai real estate investment opportunities to a wider audience.” The Dubai Land Department’s Real Estate Tokenization Project represents a major step toward modernizing property investment in the region. By placing property title deeds on the XRPL, the initiative introduces transparency and efficiency while enabling fractional ownership, allowing multiple investors to co-own properties. This approach is designed to broaden market access and create a more liquid, inclusive real estate ecosystem in Dubai. Ripple’s latest move builds on its growing momentum in the UAE. Earlier this year, Ripple became the first blockchain-enabled payments provider licensed by the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA). The company has since deepened its presence through partnerships with institutions such as Zand Bank and Mamo, both of which are leveraging Ripple’s blockchain-based payment solutions. Additionally, Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, was recently approved by the DFSA as a recognized crypto token for use within the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), reinforcing its regulatory standing in the region. With over a decade in the digital asset space and more than 60 regulatory licenses globally, Ripple is positioning itself as a key infrastructure provider for financial institutions transitioning into blockchain-based systems. Its custody solutions are designed to meet the highest compliance and security standards, catering to institutions seeking to store, exchange, and move digital assets seamlessly. Ctrl Alt, which has tokenized over $325 million worth of assets as of July 2025—including real estate, private credit, and alternative investments—brings extensive experience in financial engineering and blockchain infrastructure to the partnership. Its collaboration with Ripple underscores a growing trend: the fusion of regulated tokenization platforms with enterprise-grade custody solutions to facilitate real-world asset integration on blockchain networks.

2025-07-16T16:30:09,"Czech Koruna’s Resilient Rally: Why CNB Interest Rates Are Pivotal","BitcoinWorld Czech Koruna’s Resilient Rally: Why CNB Interest Rates Are Pivotal For many cryptocurrency enthusiasts, keeping an eye on global macroeconomic trends is just as crucial as tracking Bitcoin’s latest movements. The recent rally of the Czech Koruna offers a compelling case study in how central bank signals can profoundly impact currency markets, creating ripple effects across the broader financial landscape. What’s driving this newfound strength, and what does it mean for investors and the wider economy? Understanding the Rally: What’s Driving the Czech Koruna? The strength of the Czech Koruna can be primarily attributed to a significant shift in market expectations regarding the Czech National Bank’s (CNB) future interest rate policy. Earlier this year, market participants largely anticipated a series of aggressive rate cuts from the CNB, aiming to stimulate the economy as inflation seemed to cool. However, recent economic data has painted a different picture, leading to a moderation of these dovish expectations. Persistent Inflation: While headline inflation has decreased, core inflation, which excludes volatile items like energy and food, has shown resilience, indicating underlying price pressures. This suggests that inflation might not be falling as rapidly as initially projected. Strong Labor Market: The Czech Republic continues to boast a robust labor market with low unemployment rates and rising wages. This wage growth can fuel consumer spending, potentially creating upward pressure on prices. Global Economic Stability: A more stable global economic outlook, particularly within the Eurozone, the Czech Republic’s primary trading partner, has reduced the urgency for deep domestic rate cuts. This revised outlook has led investors to believe that the CNB will maintain its higher interest rates for a longer period than previously thought. Higher rates make a currency more attractive to foreign investors seeking better returns, thereby increasing demand for the Czech Koruna and driving its value up. CNB Interest Rates: The Core of the Koruna’s Strength The decisions made by the Czech National Bank regarding its CNB Interest Rates are the linchpin of the Koruna’s current performance. The CNB has adopted a cautious, data-dependent approach, signaling that it will only ease monetary policy when there is clear and sustained evidence that inflation is firmly on a path towards its target. Historically, central banks use interest rates as a primary tool to manage inflation and economic growth. When inflation is high, raising or maintaining high rates helps to cool down the economy by making borrowing more expensive, thereby reducing spending. Conversely, cutting rates stimulates the economy. The CNB’s current stance reflects its commitment to price stability, even if it means tolerating a stronger currency. Consider the recent trajectory of the CNB’s benchmark rate. After a period of aggressive hikes to combat surging inflation, the bank has held rates steady, resisting pressure for rapid cuts. This steadfastness has reassured the market that the CNB is serious about its inflation mandate. The expectation that CNB Interest Rates will remain elevated relative to some other developed economies creates a positive carry for investors, further bolstering the Koruna. The Czech Economy: Navigating Inflation and Growth The strength of the Czech Koruna has significant implications for the broader Czech Economy . A stronger currency can be a double-edged sword, offering both advantages and challenges. Benefits for the Czech Economy: Lower Import Costs: A stronger Koruna means that imported goods, including raw materials and energy, become cheaper. This directly helps to alleviate inflationary pressures and can reduce costs for businesses. Increased Purchasing Power: Czech consumers benefit from a stronger currency as their money can buy more foreign goods and services, including travel abroad. Attracting Foreign Investment: Higher interest rates and a stable currency can attract foreign direct investment (FDI) and portfolio investment, providing capital for economic growth and development. Challenges for the Czech Economy: Impact on Exports: A stronger Koruna makes Czech exports more expensive for foreign buyers, potentially reducing their competitiveness in international markets. This is a key concern for the export-oriented Czech economy. Tourism Sector: Similarly, a stronger currency can make the Czech Republic a more expensive destination for tourists, potentially affecting the tourism industry. Despite these challenges, the overall health of the Czech Economy , supported by low unemployment and a resilient domestic demand, provides a buffer. The CNB’s balancing act aims to achieve price stability without unduly harming economic growth. Navigating the Forex Market: Opportunities and Risks for Traders For participants in the global Forex Market , the Czech Koruna’s rally presents both opportunities and risks. Currency pairs involving the Koruna, such as EUR/CZK and USD/CZK, have experienced notable movements, reflecting the shifting sentiment. Opportunities: Carry Trade Potential: The relatively higher CNB Interest Rates compared to the Eurozone or the US make the Koruna an attractive currency for carry trades. Investors can borrow in a low-interest currency and invest in the Koruna to earn the interest rate differential. Directional Trading: Traders who correctly anticipated the moderation of rate cut expectations have been able to profit from the Koruna’s appreciation. Risks: Sudden Policy Shifts: While the CNB has been consistent, any unexpected shift in its Monetary Policy rhetoric or actual rate decisions could trigger rapid reversals in the Koruna’s value. Global Risk Sentiment: As a smaller, open economy, the Koruna can be susceptible to broader shifts in global risk sentiment. During periods of global economic uncertainty, investors often flock to safe-haven currencies, potentially putting downward pressure on emerging market currencies like the Koruna. Intervention Risk: Although less likely now, central banks sometimes intervene in currency markets to curb excessive volatility or prevent sharp appreciation/depreciation if it threatens economic stability. For those engaged in Forex Market trading, it is crucial to closely monitor CNB communications, key economic indicators from the Czech Republic, and global macroeconomic trends to make informed decisions. Monetary Policy Outlook: What’s Next for the CNB? The future trajectory of the Czech Koruna will largely depend on the Czech National Bank’s ongoing Monetary Policy decisions. The CNB has consistently emphasized its data-dependent approach, meaning that future rate adjustments will be dictated by the evolution of inflation, wage growth, and the overall economic environment. Several scenarios could unfold for the CNB’s Monetary Policy in the coming months: Gradual Cuts: If inflation continues its downward trend and approaches the CNB’s target, the bank may embark on a series of gradual rate cuts to support economic activity. These cuts are likely to be cautious and measured, reflecting the bank’s prudence. Prolonged Hold: Should inflation prove stickier than expected, or if global economic conditions deteriorate, the CNB might opt to hold rates at their current levels for an extended period, prioritizing price stability over growth stimulation. External Factors: Significant changes in the European Central Bank’s (ECB) policy or major geopolitical events could also influence the CNB’s decisions, potentially forcing it to adapt its stance to maintain stability. The CNB’s primary objective remains achieving and maintaining price stability. Its cautious approach to easing Monetary Policy is a testament to this commitment, aiming to ensure that the Koruna’s stability is built on solid economic fundamentals. Challenges and Considerations for Investors While the Czech Koruna ‘s rally highlights the power of central bank policy, investors should remain aware of inherent challenges. Currency markets are inherently volatile, influenced by a myriad of factors from economic data releases to geopolitical events. For cryptocurrency investors, understanding these macro shifts is vital, as they can indirectly impact capital flows and risk appetite across all asset classes, including digital assets. A stable traditional financial environment, partly underpinned by strong currencies, can foster broader confidence, which in turn might influence how capital is allocated across the investment spectrum. Conclusion: What Lies Ahead for the Koruna? The recent rally of the Czech Koruna is a clear indicator that market expectations around CNB Interest Rates have fundamentally shifted. The moderation of aggressive rate cut anticipations, driven by persistent inflation and a resilient Czech Economy , has provided significant tailwinds for the currency. For participants in the Forex Market , this presents both opportunities and challenges, demanding careful attention to the CNB’s ongoing Monetary Policy signals. As the Czech National Bank continues its delicate balancing act between combating inflation and supporting economic growth, the Koruna’s trajectory will remain a fascinating watch. Its resilience underscores the importance of central bank credibility and the nuanced interplay of economic data in shaping currency valuations. Investors and analysts alike will be keenly observing future CNB statements and economic releases to gauge the Koruna’s next move, cementing its position as a key currency to monitor in the global financial landscape.

The team responded within minutes by suspending all deposits. However, by that time, the hackers had already gained control of the platform’s hot wallets. In a rapid series of transactions, they extracted millions in crypto. The attackers didn’t stop there. They immediately fragmented the stolen funds, pushing them through a mix of bridges and decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Assets were quickly swapped, some converted to privacy coins to obscure the trail. Each transaction happened almost instantly, making it difficult for investigators to keep up. SlowMist TI Alert The exchange @BigONEexchange was exploited due to a supply chain attack and loss exceeds $27 million. The production network was compromised, and the operating logic of account and risk control related servers was modified, enabling the attacker to withdraw… pic.twitter.com/GkxlNIUs6A — SlowMist (@SlowMist_Team) July 16, 2025 Blockchain analysts and on-chain sleuths wasted no time mapping the hacker’s four wallet addresses. All of them showed rapid, high-volume activity. The BTC address funneled all 120 BTC (about $14.15M) into a mixing service. The TRX wallet scattered over 23 million TRX across multiple accounts in a deliberate obfuscation attempt. The ETH wallet deployed 1,272 ETH via smart contracts to disperse funds. The SOL stash routed 2,625 SOL through the Serum DEX. Investigators have tagged each transaction, and screenshots of the movement are being widely shared on social media. Despite privacy measures, many of the hacker’s steps remain visible on-chain, allowing ongoing surveillance. BigONE Responds, Promises Full Reimbursement BigONE moved quickly to reassure its community. In a bold statement, the exchange promised to fully cover all user losses. They confirmed that insurance reserves would be used, and all withdrawals would remain paused until critical upgrades are completed. They’ve brought in external auditors, hardened their security infrastructure, and isolated hot wallets into secure enclaves. A full audit roadmap has been shared publicly, and white-hat hackers have been invited to test the new systems. “We stand by our users. We will cover every cent lost. Security upgrades are nearly complete. Thank you for your continued trust and patience,” BigONE said in a pinned post on X. The response has drawn mixed reactions. Some in the community applauded the fast, transparent action and the guarantee of reimbursement—a rare move in the crypto world. Others remain skeptical, questioning how such a breach occurred and whether user funds are truly safe moving forward. Regulatory agencies across multiple jurisdictions have begun coordinating their responses. Interpol, U.S. regulators like the SEC and FinCEN, and Asian watchdogs have all requested logs and incident reports from BigONE. These cross-border investigations highlight the complex legal landscape that continues to challenge crypto enforcement. Meanwhile, bridges and DEX platforms are tightening their KYC checks, and several protocols are revisiting on-chain AML safeguards. Conversations across the community are intensifying—particularly around the trade-off between convenience and custody. Key Takeaways: Hot wallets remain a critical risk , even for major exchanges. Real-time audits and responsive monitoring are essential. Clear, transparent insurance policies help rebuild trust. Privacy tools make asset tracing more difficult—but not impossible. The wallets used in this attack are still being tracked, and any further movement could provide clues—or expose vulnerabilities. While BigONE’s recovery plan offers reassurance, the crypto world is once again reminded of the high stakes involved. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

2025-07-16T16:20:19,"Bitcoin recovers after US-CPI driven dip, ENS, BONK, SPX6900 lead altcoin recovery","Bitcoin rebounded from Tuesday’s slump after bulls held the $115,000 support, trimming earlier losses. The broader crypto market followed suit, with total market capitalisation climbing back above $3.8 trillion and reaching an intraday high of $3.838 trillion. However, sentiment turned cautious amid renewed macro uncertainty. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index slipped three points to 70, though it remained in the “Greed” zone. Altcoin markets regained momentum alongside Bitcoin, as it began retracing its path toward the $120,000 level. What’s next for Bitcoin? Bitcoin’s recent dip followed the release of the June U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI), which showed inflation climbing for the second month in a row. Headline inflation rose to 2.7% year-over-year, the highest since February, while core inflation increased to 2.9%, just below expectations. The monthly rise in CPI was 0.3%, the steepest since January, reinforcing concerns that inflation remains persistent, particularly in key categories such as food and transportation. The data tempered market expectations of a near-term shift in U.S. Federal Reserve policy. Although the lower-than-expected core CPI figure offered some relief, rising headline inflation dampened hopes of a dovish outcome at the upcoming July Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. As of now, CME FedWatch data shows a 54.3% probability of a rate cut in September, leaving markets in a wait-and-see mode ahead of the U.S. Producer Price Index (PPI) report due later this week. Compounding the pressure were concerns over potential trade escalation between the US and Russia. Washington’s threat to impose 100% tariffs unless the Ukraine conflict is resolved within 50 days has added another layer of uncertainty, slowing the pace of the recent crypto rally. Profit-taking further weighed on prices as Glassnode data shows that investors holding Bitcoin for over five months accounted for 56% of realized profits during the downturn, collectively offloading $1.96 billion. Miners also joined in. According to on-chain data from CryptoQuant, the Miners’ Position Index (MPI) rose above 2.7, which signals an uptick in Bitcoin transfers from miners to exchanges. Historically, such movements often precede short-term corrections, as miners look to lock in gains after strong price rallies. However, analysts note that this MPI level remains far below extremes seen during past market tops. Some see the current trend as consistent with a typical bull cycle, where brief consolidations or pullbacks are followed by renewed upward momentum. Further on-chain analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Onchain School highlighted a spike in profit-taking from long-term holders about 10 days ago. While this didn’t prevent Bitcoin from notching new highs, it signals that older coins are being moved, often an indicator of top-cycle selling. Despite the temporary pressure, Bitcoin’s defense of the $115,000 level has revived bullish sentiment. With the June PPI data now released, showing wholesale inflation remained flat, markets are shifting focus to upcoming Fed guidance, as traders watch whether Bitcoin can regain strength and attempt another breakout above $120,000. Bitcoin still has room to run Despite hitting new all-time highs earlier this week, analysts say Bitcoin is not yet in overheated territory. According to CryptoQuant’s Axel Adler Jr., the market has not triggered a “Peak Signal”, a metric that typically appears when Bitcoin reaches major tops. The signal, based on normalized price models and coin destruction metrics, remains absent, suggesting the current cycle may still have upside potential. See below. Axel 💎🙌 Adler Jr @AxelAdlerJr · Follow The Peak Signal only appears at major market tops, and it hasn’t shown up this time suggesting we’re not at a peak yet. 11:13 AM · Jul 16, 2025 343 Reply Copy link Read 26 replies Supporting this view, analyst and CryptoQuant contributor Crypto Dan pointed to Bitcoin’s Realized Cap-UTXO Age Bands, which also show no signs of excessive market froth. Bitcoin: Realized Cap – UTXO age bands (%). Source: Crypto Dan These metrics track the realised value of Bitcoin across different age cohorts and currently reflect a healthy distribution, not one typically seen during overheated conditions. Analysts are also analysing cost-basis levels of short-term holders to identify potential inflection points in Bitcoin’s price trend. CryptoQuant’s Crazzyblockk recently flagged several cost-basis levels derived from the realized price model that could act as key technical zones. On the upside, $124,000 marks the STH cost basis pushed one standard deviation above average, a level historically linked to local tops and profit-taking zones. A breakout above this could open the door to the next resistance band at $136,000, the most aggressive STH threshold. This level often coincides with overbought conditions and heightened unrealized profits for recent buyers. To the downside, immediate support lies near $113,000, followed by $111,000, the average acquisition price of Bitcoin holders from the past month. The most critical level to watch is $101,000, which represents the base STH realized price. Holding above this zone is seen as a key indicator of the bullish structure remaining in the short-medium term. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was hovering just below the $120,000 mark. A decisive break above this psychological threshold could reignite bullish momentum, provided macroeconomic headwinds do not undermine market confidence. In that scenario, many analysts speculated that the next technical target for Bitcoin would likely fall near the $130,000 mark, which also aligns with the key resistance zones highlighted in short-term holder cost-basis models. Top altcoin gainers of the day Alongside Bitcoin, the altcoin market rose 15.5% over the past 24 hours, reaching a total market cap of $1.49 trillion at the time of writing. This came as the Altcoin Season Index score increased by 6 points to 36, indicating more altcoins are starting to outbid BTC’s performance, signalling an early shift in market dynamics toward a potential altcoin season.. Ethereum, the largest altcoin by market cap, posted a 9% gain during this period, slightly ahead of XRP, Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Cardano (ADA), which recorded gains between 4% and 8%. Ethereum Name Service (ENS), Bonk (BONK), and SPX6900 (SPX) showed the best performance among the top 100 altcoins today, with all of them netting gains around 20%. See below: Source: CoinMarketCap Ethereum Name Service : As a core part of the Ethereum ecosystem, ENS has benefited from Ethereum’s rally over the past week, which has strengthened bullish sentiment across related tokens. ENS climbed to a five-month high of $27.33 earlier today before stabilising at $26.70, bringing its market cap to $976 million at press time. Bonk : Bonk’s rally today builds on momentum sparked by news that Grayscale Investments has added BONK to its expanded institutional monitoring list. As such, traders believe BONK is now on Grayscale’s radar for potential inclusion in future investment products, like trusts or ETFs. Any sort of institutional involvement is typically considered bullish, especially for hype driven memecoins like Bonk. SPX6900 : SPX6900 extended its rally after breaking out of a bullish flag pattern, with momentum further boosted by softer-than-expected U.S. PPI data released earlier today. The cooling inflation print revived risk appetite across speculative assets, helping SPX climb over 22% to a new all-time high of $1.85, before easing slightly at press time.

2025-07-16T16:17:28,"Bitcoin Surge Could Propel Ethereum and Cardano Toward New Highs","A significant rise in Bitcoin's value may push other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Cardano to impressive new levels. As Bitcoin gains momentum, it often influences the broader market, creating potential opportunities for other digital assets. This article delves into the possible ripple effect, examining which coins could be poised for substantial growth. This analysis is brought to you by Outset PR , a crypto-native firm that combines data analysis with communication strategy. It keenly observes trends and timing to help blockchain projects transform pivotal moments into lasting visibility. Ethereum Eyes Growth with Recent Price Surge Source: tradingview Ethereum is showing promising movement in its current price range of just over two and a half thousand to over three thousand dollars. Recently, Ethereum's price has jumped by more than 18% in the past week alone. This could signal good news for investors. If it keeps climbing, it may face some challenges around the nearest resistance level, about ten percent higher than the current top range. But should it break through this point, the second resistance suggests the potential to rally much further, reaching nearly 23% from the present level. While it has dipped in the past months, this positive momentum hints that Ethereum could be bouncing back. Cardano's Steady Climb: What’s Next for ADA? Source: tradingview Cardano's price has been moving between a little over sixty cents and just above eighty cents recently. It gained over 26% in the past week and nearly 17% for the month. The coin sits right above its ten and hundred-day simple moving averages, both at seventy-three cents. While its relative strength shows a balanced momentum, the nearest hurdle is at ninety cents. If Cardano breaks this level, it could target a dollar ten, meaning a potential climb of about 35% from current top levels. However, should it slip, the closest safety net lies around just under fifty cents. This mix of steady movements and promising growth potential keeps traders' eyes on ADA.

2025-07-16T16:17:07,"Chinese Analyst Shares the Level He Thinks Bitcoin (BTC) Price Will Hit in Six Months","Constellation Research founder and investor Ray “R” Wang made noteworthy predictions about digital assets and tech giants on the Fox Business program “Varney & Co.” Wang argued that a “golden age” for digital assets has begun, while stating that Bitcoin could rise to $150,000 within the next six months. According to Wang, legislative developments in the US, such as the Clarity Act, the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, and the Genius Act, which provide clarity on cryptocurrency regulations, are boosting confidence in Bitcoin. Furthermore, the White House's actions supporting these regulations and the expectation of falling interest rates, coupled with the depreciation of the dollar, will drive investors toward riskier assets. This, Wang argues, creates a strong foundation for Bitcoin's rise. Related News: Ripple's Dubai Landing: Announced Critical Collaboration Wang also stated that the adoption of Bitcoin as a reserve asset by some countries and the rise of stablecoin initiatives will also increase demand. “Digital assets are poised for growth in a more decentralized and regulated manner than ever before,” Wang said, adding that these developments will push prices higher. Wang made a striking prediction not only about the cryptocurrency market but also about tech giant Nvidia. He claimed that Nvidia shares, currently trading around $170, could reach $200 by the end of the year. He cited the lifting of the Chinese chip ban and the shift of countries toward Nvidia hardware for “sovereign AI” projects as key reasons for this. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-16T16:05:34,"It’s Time to Promote the Correct Crypto Allocation","Let’s be honest. Last month, I released a white paper explaining that conservative investors should allocate 10% to crypto, moderate clients should invest 25% and aggressive investors should place 40% of their portfolios into crypto. Bitcoin has outperformed every other asset class for 12 of the past 15 years , and it’s highly likely that it will continue to do so for years to come. Institutions are investing like never before. Congress and the administration now fully support crypto, and we’re beginning to get the regulatory clarity we’ve wanted. The SEC and FINRA’s prohibitions that blocked brokerage firms from trading or custodying crypto have been rescinded. The OCC and the Fed have revoked similar prohibitions against banks, and the Department of Labor has rescinded its objection that prevented 401(k) plans from offering bitcoin as an investment option. Despite the growth and performance of bitcoin, I keep seeing suggestions that people ought to allocate only 1 or 2 percent to crypto. In my opinion, that is no longer enough. Crypto is no longer speculative. It is no longer niche. It now deserves to be treated as a core allocation. Consider this hypothetical illustration, comparing a traditional 60/40 portfolio of stocks/bonds to portfolios that hold 10 percent, 25 percent or 40 percent in bitcoin. Let’s assume we invest $100 for five years, earning 7 percent annually in the 60/40 allocation. Let’s also look at two extreme outcomes: bitcoin either becomes worthless, or it rises in five years to $1 million (roughly a 10x increase from today). As you see in the chart below, the $100 invested in the 60/40 portfolio rises to $140 after five years. Not bad. But the portfolio with a 25 percent bitcoin allocation could be worth more than 250 percent more. Even if bitcoin were to become worthless (and you held it all the way to zero), your portfolio would still be profitable – with a value above your original investment. Seems to me that the risk/reward ratio strongly favors a significant crypto allocation – and certainly one that’s far higher than a measly 1 or 2 percent. Potential Range of Portfolio Returns Based on Bitcoin Allocation Bitcoin’s price appreciation isn’t speculation – it’s just supply and demand. In Q1 2025, public companies purchased 95,000 bitcoins – more than double the new supply. And that’s from just one category of buyers – it ignores additional demand from retail investors, financial advisors, family offices, hedge funds, institutional investors and sovereign wealth funds. This massive imbalance between supply and demand is driving bitcoin’s price to all-time highs. I predict that bitcoin will reach $500,000 by 2030 – a 5x increase as of this writing. The adoption curve has tremendous room to run – supporting the thesis that there is substantial upside yet to come in bitcoin’s price.

2025-07-16T15:49:30,"Top 5 Countries Leading Crypto Adoption in 2025","As the crypto market continues its global expansion, 2025 has seen a remarkable surge in both institutional and grassroots adoption across emerging economies. While tech-savvy populations and economic instability drive adoption in some regions, others are strategically integrating digital assets into national development plans. This global shift offers massive opportunity, but also raises a critical challenge for crypto founders: how to gain visibility and trust in different markets. That’s where Outset PR plays a pivotal role. This review explores the top five countries leading the charge in crypto adoption this year: India, Bhutan, El Salvador, Nigeria, and Vietnam. India: The Retail Adoption Giant India continues to dominate global rankings with the largest number of cryptocurrency users—over 100 million, according to estimates by Triple-A . Despite regulatory ambiguity, Indian users have embraced crypto for investments, remittances, and participation in DeFi ecosystems. 🔹 Key Drivers: A rapidly digitizing economy with high mobile and internet penetration A booming startup and blockchain developer ecosystem Popular platforms like WazirX and CoinDCX providing local onramps 🔹 Use Cases: Retail investing and trading International remittances from the Indian diaspora NFT and gaming markets gaining traction among Gen Z 🔹 Challenges: Heavy taxation (30% on crypto gains) and lack of a dedicated regulatory framework may limit future growth if not addressed. Bottom Line: India’s crypto momentum is grassroots-led, massive in scale, and largely resilient to policy turbulence. Bhutan: The Sustainable Sovereign Crypto Model Bhutan is the quiet powerhouse in 2025’s crypto landscape, turning heads with its green Bitcoin mining, sovereign holdings, and national merchant adoption. Backed by abundant hydropower, the country has built a reputation for sustainable mining and forward-thinking digital asset policy. 🔹 Key Drivers: Over $1 billion in Bitcoin reserves held by Druk Holdings National strategy to integrate BTC, ETH, and BNB into the treasury Partnership with Binance Pay enabling crypto payments across 1,000+ merchants 🔹 Use Cases: State mining operations using renewable energy Tourism and retail payments in crypto Institutional investment and diversification 🔹 Innovations: The Gelephu Mindfulness City project integrates blockchain, green tech, and digital assets as part of a sustainable economic future. Bottom Line: Bhutan exemplifies a nation-state crypto model blending ecological sustainability with digital finance leadership. El Salvador: The Legal Tender Pioneer In 2021, El Salvador made history as the first country to declare Bitcoin legal tender. While the initial push was met with global scrutiny, 2025 reveals a more balanced approach—with BTC still central to national reserves but no longer mandatory for merchants. 🔹 Key Drivers: Sovereign Bitcoin holdings exceed 6,000 BTC, now worth over $300M–600M Educational campaigns, Bitcoin bonds, and the ""Bitcoin City"" development project Legal infrastructure created by the Bitcoin Law 🔹 Challenges: Low public adoption: Less than 2% of the population actively uses Bitcoin Minimal impact on remittance flows and financial inclusion despite state efforts 🔹 Adjustments: The government softened legal tender mandates in 2025 to align with IMF guidance, focusing on voluntary usage and infrastructure. Bottom Line: El Salvador’s Bitcoin journey remains symbolically and geopolitically significant, though grassroots adoption is limited. Nigeria: Crypto for Financial Survival Nigeria ranks among the top countries for grassroots crypto adoption, especially in peer-to-peer (P2P) trading. With chronic inflation, unstable fiat currency (the Naira), and a young, tech-adept population, crypto has become a financial lifeline. 🔹 Key Drivers: High inflation and limited access to traditional banking Broad adoption of stablecoins like USDT via platforms such as Binance P2P Youth-led digital innovation and freelancing boom 🔹 Use Cases: Daily savings and payments using stablecoins Remittances and cross-border transactions Hedge against local currency devaluation 🔹 Policy Landscape: The Central Bank has shifted from outright bans to regulatory engagement in 2025, signaling a more cooperative approach. Bottom Line: Nigeria showcases real-world crypto utility in response to systemic financial challenges. Vietnam: The Crypto-Gaming Nexus Vietnam continues to impress with a strong mix of grassroots crypto adoption, DeFi engagement, and a booming blockchain gaming sector. From retail investors to developers, Vietnam is a top player in Southeast Asia’s digital economy. 🔹 Key Drivers: Birthplace of Axie Infinity, a pioneer in play-to-earn (P2E) gaming High mobile penetration and youth engagement Fast-growing DeFi ecosystem 🔹 Use Cases: P2E gaming income and NFT trading Crypto savings and trading platforms (e.g., ONUS) Digital remittances among overseas Vietnamese 🔹 Market Dynamics: Despite cautious government oversight, crypto remains a mainstream financial tool in many Vietnamese households. Bottom Line: Vietnam blends tech innovation with financial opportunity, making crypto a vital part of its digital economy. A Multipolar Crypto World The top five countries in 2025 reflect a diverse set of crypto adoption models: Country Adoption Type Distinctive Trait India Mass retail World's largest crypto user base Bhutan Institutional Green mining + merchant adoption El Salvador Legal + symbolic First Bitcoin legal tender, still evolving Nigeria Grassroots survival Crypto as a hedge against inflation Vietnam Hybrid innovation Gaming + DeFi fueling national interest These nations prove that crypto adoption is not one-size-fits-all. Whether driven by necessity, opportunity, or strategy, digital assets are becoming increasingly embedded in national economic fabrics across the globe.

2025-07-16T15:39:28,"Altcoin Season Returns? Bitcoin Consolidates With ETH, SUI, SEI Among Those Taking Charge","Bitcoin triumphantly formed a series of fresh record highs last week, eventually topping out just shy of $124,000 as profit taking emerged. The rise has paved the way for what many are describing as the latest ""altcoin season,"" which involves crypto tokens other than bitcoin making often exponential moves to the upside. The recent bitcoin bull market has just been that: a bitcoin bull market with altcoins taking the back seat as institutions rallied around spot bitcoin ETFs and BTC-based treasuries. But there has been a change in behavior this week. Several altcoins have posted gains of between 50% and 80% as capital begins to flow from the world's dominant crypto to more speculative bets. Ether had a good week on the back of a wave of institutional interest, rising by 23.3% compared to bitcoin's 9.3% gain. Other layer-1 blockchains like SEI and SUI also performed well, increasing by 41% and 36%, respectively. Are we in an altcoin season? Altcoin seasons in previous bull markets have been a culmination of euphoria, speculative and viral moves often led by crypto influencers and celebrities. This time around it appears more precise and surgical, altcoins tied to projects with a lot of activity like SUI are the tokens moving. The data is also showing early signs of an altcoin season, CryptoQuant's MRVR-based altcoin season indicator has ticked into altcoin season for consecutive weeks for the first time since June 2024, indicating a shift in momentum. MVRV shows the market value's relative position to BTC and ETH, during previous bullish cycles the indicator was in an altcoin season for months at a time. Furthermore, the meme coin dominance chart has been on a significant downtrend since the turn of the year after botched meme coins issued by U.S. President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump. The shift away from meme coins suggest that the this period of the cycle may be categorized by tokens tied to projects with merit rising as opposed to speculative high and euphoria. CoinDesk's CD20 index has also outperformed the CD5 index , the latter of which just considers BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL and ADA while the CD20 includes more altcoins, further demonstrating a transition into a bullish market for altcoins. CoinMarketCap's altcoin season barometer has also ticked up to 36 out of 100, a level seen just once in the past 90 days. What happens next The altcoin market is still heavily reliant on BTC. If bitcoin continues to consolidate above prior record highs at $112,000, altcoins are primed for a continued move to the upside. However, if bitcoin continues its ascent into unchartered territories, or if it breaks below $112,00, the altcoin market will underperform against BTC. This is because altcoins lack sufficient liquidity to deal with major price swings and if BTC continues to move to the upside, capital will be allocated to chasing that rally while altcoins take a back seat.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/16/is-a-crypto-altcoin-season-here-bitcoin-consolidates-as-alts-take-charge,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ETH","Markets|altcoin|alt season|Bull Market|News",cryptocompare
2025-07-16T15:37:12,"Bitcoin’s Pause Is Ethereum’s Green Light: Here’s What’s Next","Bitcoin’s surge has paused as traders engaged in profit-taking. This triggered a pullback, which dragged the cryptocurrency near $116,000. It has since staged a recovery of nearly 2%, pushing Bitcoin above $119,000 at the time of writing. New data has emerged, signaling that BTC is not at a local top but in a transition phase, with timing, behavior, and structure all pointing to further upside. BTC Makes Room for Alts According to the analytics firm, SwissBlock’s latest market report, ‘Altcoin Vector,’ beneath the surface, capital rotation has started , and Ethereum is emerging as the next leg of the cycle. The firm said that Bitcoin is consolidating , and not breaking down. BTC dominance has likely peaked in the short term as capital rotation accelerates across the crypto market. The ETH/BTC ratio is also rising steadily, which is indicative of Ethereum’s relative strength and its ability to attract liquidity from Bitcoin while also lifting the broader altcoin complex. This is is also driving renewed momentum in other altcoins as liquidity moves within the market rather than exiting it. This trend indicates an expansion phase where capital is redeploying into Ethereum and select altcoins, while simultaneously reducing BTC’s market share. The rotation means that confidence remains intact as investors seek higher returns beyond BTC. BTC Hasn’t Topped Yet While Bitcoin’s pause has triggered rotation into Ethereum and altcoins, SwissBlock argued that the broader cycle for the world’s largest crypto itself remains unfinished. According to BTC Vector’s Optimal Signal, each major expansion in this cycle has lasted 15-30 days, while the current rally is only on day 12. With capital beginning to rotate into Ethereum, it indicates that the cycle remains incomplete. To top that, Glassnode’s Short-Term Holder Relative Unrealized Profit also remains well below levels seen during previous cycle tops in January and April 2024, which means that market participants are not exhibiting excessive profit-taking or euphoria yet. Additionally, both Willy Woo’s Speculation Index and VWAP Liquidity confirm that the market is not overheated, as neither indicator has reached prior cycle extremes. These factors together suggest there is ongoing structural support for Bitcoin to move higher.

Recently, a significant announcement from Canadian fintech firm LQWD has captured the attention of the crypto community: a groundbreaking $10 million At-The-Market (ATM) Program. This move isn’t just about raising capital; it’s a strategic play designed to deepen the company’s commitment to the digital asset space, specifically through increased Bitcoin purchases and robust support for the Lightning Network. Let’s dive into what this means for the future of crypto financing and how LQWD is positioning itself at the forefront of this exciting evolution. Understanding LQWD’s Strategic ATM Program LQWD, a company focused on decentralized finance and the Lightning Network, has unveiled its $10 million ATM Program. This financing vehicle is a common method used by publicly traded companies to raise capital by issuing and selling new common shares directly into the open market at prevailing prices. It offers flexibility and efficiency, allowing companies to tap into liquidity as needed without the complexities and costs associated with traditional underwritten offerings. So, what exactly is an ATM Program and why is it beneficial for a company like LQWD? Flexibility: Unlike a fixed-price offering, an ATM program allows the company to sell shares over a period, adapting to market conditions. Cost-Effective: It typically involves lower fees compared to a traditional public offering. Market-Driven: Shares are sold at market prices, reducing the potential for price dilution often seen with large, sudden issuances. Continuous Capital Access: Provides an ongoing source of funds for strategic initiatives. This approach highlights a growing trend in crypto financing , where companies are finding novel ways to fund their operations and expand their digital asset holdings. LQWD’s decision to utilize an ATM Program signals a mature and measured approach to capital management in the volatile crypto market. Why Are Bitcoin Purchases a Key Focus for LQWD? At the heart of LQWD’s ATM Program lies a clear objective: to facilitate more Bitcoin purchases . Bitcoin, as the original and largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, continues to be seen as a foundational digital asset and a store of value. For a company like LQWD, which is deeply embedded in the Bitcoin ecosystem through its Lightning Network infrastructure, increasing its BTC holdings is a logical and strategic move. There are several compelling reasons why companies are increasingly prioritizing Bitcoin acquisitions: Balance Sheet Strength: Holding Bitcoin can be viewed as a hedge against inflation and a way to diversify corporate treasuries. Alignment with Core Business: For crypto-native companies, holding BTC aligns their financial interests with the success of the broader crypto market. Liquidity for Operations: Bitcoin can be used to fund various operational needs, especially within the crypto space. Strategic Asset: For a company focused on the Lightning Network, owning more Bitcoin provides the necessary liquidity to operate and expand its network nodes. LQWD’s commitment to increasing its Bitcoin reserves demonstrates a strong conviction in the long-term value and utility of the digital asset, reinforcing its position as a key player in the evolving digital economy. How Does This Program Impact the Lightning Network? Beyond direct Bitcoin purchases, a significant portion of the proceeds from LQWD’s ATM Program is earmarked to boost the Lightning Network . For those unfamiliar, the Lightning Network is a ‘layer 2’ payment protocol built on top of Bitcoin. It enables incredibly fast, low-cost, and scalable Bitcoin transactions, addressing some of Bitcoin’s inherent limitations as a medium of exchange. LQWD is a significant operator of Lightning Network nodes, providing crucial infrastructure that allows these rapid transactions to occur. By investing further in this network, LQWD aims to: Aspect Impact of LQWD’s Investment Node Capacity Increased capital allows for more robust and higher-capacity Lightning nodes. Channel Liquidity More Bitcoin enables the creation of larger and more liquid payment channels, improving transaction reliability. Network Reach Expanded infrastructure can lead to broader adoption and accessibility of Lightning payments globally. Transaction Efficiency A stronger network means even faster and cheaper Bitcoin transactions for users. This investment is crucial for the continued growth and mainstream adoption of Bitcoin as a transactional currency. A more robust Lightning Network means a better user experience, paving the way for Bitcoin to be used for everyday purchases, remittances, and micro-transactions worldwide. LQWD’s strategic focus on strengthening this vital layer of the Bitcoin ecosystem is a testament to its vision for a truly scalable digital economy. What Does This Mean for LQWD and Its Investors? For LQWD itself, this $10 million ATM Program represents a significant step in solidifying its financial position and executing its growth strategy. By securing flexible access to capital, the company can proactively pursue opportunities within the Bitcoin and Lightning Network space without being constrained by immediate cash flow needs. For investors, this move could be interpreted in several ways: Confidence in Strategy: The company is demonstrating confidence in its long-term vision for the Lightning Network and Bitcoin. Growth Potential: Increased investment in infrastructure and Bitcoin holdings could lead to enhanced revenue streams and asset appreciation. Market Signal: It sends a strong signal to the market about LQWD’s commitment to expanding its footprint in the digital asset industry. It’s an interesting time for companies operating at the intersection of traditional finance and cutting-edge blockchain technology. LQWD’s ATM Program exemplifies how established financial mechanisms are being adapted to fuel innovation in the rapidly expanding crypto landscape. Conclusion: A Strategic Leap Forward in Crypto Financing LQWD’s launch of a $10 million ATM Program is more than just a fundraising initiative; it’s a strategic declaration of intent. By leveraging this flexible financing vehicle, the Canadian fintech firm is not only securing capital but also directly investing in the foundational pillars of the decentralized economy: Bitcoin and the Lightning Network. This move underscores the growing maturity of the crypto market and the innovative ways companies are approaching capital management to drive adoption and build robust infrastructure. As the crypto space continues to evolve, we can expect to see more such sophisticated financial maneuvers. LQWD’s commitment to strengthening the Lightning Network through strategic Bitcoin purchases is a positive indicator for the broader ecosystem, promising faster, cheaper, and more accessible Bitcoin transactions for everyone. It’s a clear signal that the future of finance is becoming increasingly digital, and companies like LQWD are leading the charge.

On Monday, BTC surged to a new all-time high of $123,200, only to retrace to $115,700 by Tuesday, highlighting the fast-paced, high-stakes environment that has returned to the crypto market. Despite the sharp pullback, the overall trend remains bullish, with price structure and momentum still favoring the bulls. Related Reading: SharpLink Gaming Buys $73M in Ethereum – Smart Money Loads the Dip Bitcoin has held above key support levels, and buyers continue to step in on dips, reinforcing confidence in the ongoing uptrend. The recent move is viewed by many as a healthy correction rather than a reversal, especially given the macro backdrop and rising institutional involvement. Adding to the bullish narrative, CryptoQuant data reveals that retail investors are making a comeback. The 30-day change in demand for small BTC transfers (ranging from $0–$10K) is signaling renewed interest from retail investors. Retail Demand Reawakens As Crypto Week Advances In Washington Top analyst Axel Adler has highlighted a critical on-chain signal that points to the return of retail investors in the Bitcoin market. The 30-day change in demand for small transfer volumes ($0–$10K) has moved out of negative territory for the first time in months. This shift indicates a meaningful increase in activity from smaller holders—widely interpreted as retail participants—after a prolonged period of dormancy. Retail involvement plays a crucial role in sustaining long-term bullish trends. While institutional demand often drives initial breakouts, it is the broad participation from everyday investors that adds momentum and staying power to rallies. The reappearance of retail buying interest not only strengthens Bitcoin’s current price structure but also suggests growing confidence in the asset’s outlook, despite recent volatility. This renewed demand comes at a pivotal time. “Crypto Week” is underway in the US Congress, where lawmakers are actively debating and voting on three major cryptocurrency bills. The outcomes of these discussions are expected to shape the regulatory landscape for years to come and could provide the clarity that both retail and institutional investors have long awaited. For now, the uptick in small-scale BTC transfers is a strong signal. That retail investors are re-engaging just as the crypto industry prepares for potentially historic policy changes. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bears Strike Back After ATH: Long/Short Ratio Flips Negative BTC Holds Above $118K After Reclaiming Breakout Zone Bitcoin is currently trading at $118,914 on the daily chart. After a sharp rally pushed it to a new all-time high of $123,200 earlier this week. The price has since retraced, but BTC continues to hold above key support levels, signaling bullish resilience. The recent dip toward $117,000 was met with buyer interest, as seen in the long lower wick and a moderate bounce on rising volume. The chart shows that BTC is comfortably trading above the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day simple moving averages (SMAs). Currently at $108,040, $102,116, and $97,362, respectively—all of which are upward sloping. This confirms a strong bullish structure, with momentum still favoring buyers in the medium to long term.

2025-07-16T15:27:09,"Canadian-Based Tech Company Approves Treasury Strategy Aiming to Collect 6,000 Bitcoins! Details Here","Canada-based company Matador Technologies announced that its board of directors has approved a long-term Bitcoin accumulation strategy. Matador Technologies Confirms Treasury Strategy Aiming to Collect 6,000 Bitcoin by 2027 The company's ultimate goal is to reach 6,000 BTC by 2027 and become one of the top 20 institutional Bitcoin holders globally. The company currently holds 77.4 BTC and its equivalent in assets. As part of the new strategy, plans have been created to accumulate 1,000 BTC by 2026 and 6,000 BTC by 2027. The board of directors described these goals as “deterministic but predictive” and emphasized that there is no financial commitment. Matador calculated that if this fund were to be fully acquired in Bitcoin under the current CAD 900 million shelf allowance, approximately 5,934 BTC could be acquired at an average of CAD 151,659. The total is projected to reach approximately 6,011 BTC, including existing assets. This scenario aligns with the company's 2027 target. However, it was noted that these calculations are for illustrative purposes only. The company stated that additional Bitcoin purchases will be subject to various factors, including financing opportunities, market conditions, and regulatory approvals. It also stated that price and timing will be considered, with the goal of maximizing Bitcoin (BPS) value per share. Matador will operate with the goal of maintaining a strong capital structure during this period. There is no guarantee that financing options will be available on favorable terms. This announcement marks Matador's arrival among the firms embracing a digital asset strategy at the institutional level. The company has identified a long-term vision of acquiring a 1% stake in the Bitcoin supply, a move that further solidifies institutional interest in the sector. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-16T15:23:01,"Cantor Equity Partners 1 Gains 25% on $3.5B Bitcoin Deal With Adam Back","Cantor Equity Partners I (CEPO) is changing hands just shy of $15 in morning U.S. action, up about 25% from the $12 level it traded at prior to a late-Tuesday story from the FT that the company and Adam Back were nearing a $3.5 billion funding deal. To review, CEPO is the blank check bitcoin treasury company headed by Brandon Lutnick — chairman of Wall Street investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald and son of Trump administration Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. According to the FT report , Cantor Equity Partners 1 would acquire 30,000 BTC (nearly $3.5 billion at current prices) from Back. In return, Back would receive equity in the vehicle, which would be renamed BSTR Holdings. CEPO is also seeking to raise another $800 million of additional capital to acquire even more BTC, the report said. Back cashing out? Cynics might believe that the move signals a desire by Back — one of Bitcoin's OGs whose cryptography work was used by the network's creator Satoshi Nakamoto — to cash in on some of his vast BTC holdings. This couldn't be further from the truth, according to CoinDesk Senior Analyst James Van Straten. ""Far from being a mere liquidity event for Back, this partnership underscores his long-term conviction that Bitcoin should become a core asset class in traditional finance portfolios,"" said Van Straten. ""Rather than cashing out, Back seems intent on leveraging institutional vehicles to push Bitcoin further into the financial mainstream, bridging the gap between btc-native innovation and Wall Street capital."" Van Straten further noted that Back has invested his own cash in the funding of other bitcoin treasury strategy companies. ""This deal reinforces the notion that Back’s priorities lie in expanding Bitcoin’s institutional use cases, not simply realizing gains on his holdings,"" he concluded.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/16/cantor-equity-partners-1-gains-25-on-35b-bitcoin-deal-with-adam-back,"BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TREASURY|BUSINESS","Markets|Adam Back|Bitcoin|Cantor fitzgerald|News",cryptocompare

2025-07-16T15:15:45,"Tether eyes LATAM commodity trade with strategic $600M Adecoagro acquisition","Tether, the largest digital asset company and USDT issuer globally, signals a significant entry into the Latin American commodity markets with the $600 million purchase of a controlling stake in regional agribusiness leader Adecoagro. According to Reuters, the agreement announced in March awarded Tether approximately 70% of Adecoagro. The New York-listed company makes dairy in Argentina, sugar and rice in Brazil, and ethanol in Uruguay. The acquisition will allow Tether to deepen its US dollar-pegged stablecoin into the multi-trillion-dollar global commodities trade, beginning with agricultural and energy exports in South America, the company said. Bringing stablecoins into the real economy Tether’s USDT token, introduced in 2014, is intended to track the US dollar and is frequently used in cryptocurrency markets as a reliable store of value. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, USDT is primarily supported by US Treasury bonds. Tether reported $149 billion in reserves and $143 billion in issued USDT in its first-quarter 2025 report, with $120 trillion in Treasuries. The company now intends to employ USDT for cross-border payments in traditional industries, rather than just cryptocurrency exchanges. “Tether seeks to increase the use of its stablecoin for cross-border payments. “I believe this will grow significantly in the financial markets, particularly in commodities markets,” said Marcos Viriato, CEO of Parfin, a South American fintech that provides infrastructure for cryptocurrency transactions. Parfin is cooperating with Banco Bradesco, Brazil’s third-largest bank, on a trial program that allows exporters to receive payments in USDT. The stablecoin is converted into local currency and placed into firm accounts, lowering expenses and shortening transaction times from many days to mere seconds. Crypto meets commodity production The acquisition of Adecoagro is part of a larger trend where crypto firms have been making investments in physical assets. Joe Sticco, CEO of Cryptex Finance, commented that Tether earns a steady income from businesses such as farmland and processing plants, making investments that complement the balance sheet of the crypto-oriented company and protect against inflation. For Tether, the plan is two-pronged: fortify its financial base and get as much real-life usage of USDT as possible. It is cooperating with Adecoagro management, as well as agricultural experts, to potentially leverage stablecoins in commodity transactions and increase liquidity and efficiency in trading. This is not an untried concept for the company. Tether paid for a crude oil transaction between a large energy producer and a commodities broker with USDT in late 2024, a first for such an agreement to be fully settled in a stablecoin. As geopolitical developments occur, such use cases gain traction. According to reports, Russia and Venezuela have used cryptocurrency to enable oil deals with countries such as China and India, so bypassing Western financial sanctions. Tokenising Latin America’s harvest While Tether has not announced any concrete intentions, industry experts believe the business would eventually tokenise agricultural items. Gracy Chen, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Bitget, stated that, similar to Tether’s gold-backed token, the company may explore digital tokens for commodities such as corn or sugar. These could be used as collateral for pre-harvest finance or as hedging tools for producers. “In effect, they’re turning farmland and sugar mills into programmable instruments of finance,” Chen told me. Tether acknowledged the possibility of tokenising actual assets such as agricultural commodities, but stated that there are no imminent plans to release such tokens. Renewables and Bitcoin mining Meanwhile, Adecoagro’s renewable energy assets have already been put to use. Tether has revealed that a portion of its bitcoin mining activities would be powered by electricity supplied by Adecoagro’s sugarcane-based mills in South America. The move is consistent with Tether’s objective of integrating real-world infrastructure to serve its cryptocurrency ecosystem. Tether is establishing its stablecoin as a major instrument in global trade by deepening its involvement in Latin America’s agricultural and energy economies.

The company argues that the architecture of Ethereum is evolving beyond a smart contract platform into the foundation for programmable, verifiable trust in financial systems. This shift, it argues, could eventually push the price of Ether (ETH) to $15,800 by 2028. Trustware: Ethereum’s Next Identity Trust is the underpinning of the economy — from banks to justice systems — and Consensys estimates that over $9.3 trillion is spent annually on trust infrastructure. Yet, Ethereum, through its decentralized and transparent code, suggests a digital alternative: trustware. Trustware is a new way of talking about the incredible value that Ethereum is already bringing to the economy,” said Jason Linehan, chief strategy officer at Consensys. In his view, Ethereum has become a programmable alternative to conventional intermediaries. Cost-to-Corrupt: A New Valuation Model At the heart of Consensys’ ETH bull thesis is the “cost-to-corrupt” framework. The framework ties Ethereum’s market capitalization to the security it provides to onchain value like stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets. Given growth in these asset categories — $1T in stablecoins, $500B in tokenized RWAs, and $300B in DeFi TVL by 2028 — ETH would reach $15,800. Linehan characterizes these projections as conservative, with some estimates significantly higher. Ethereum’s First Mover Advantage and Market Opportunity Despite competition, Ethereum is still securing $220B of High-Quality Liquid Assets, compared to Solana’s $20.3B and Avalanche’s $3.7B. Moreover, the entire crypto market is only 0.3% of global wealth, with plenty of room for adoption. Consensys believes the next era will be one of “agentic finance” — global scale finance managed by sophisticated algorithms, with Ethereum at its core. A Decade of Innovation and Institutional Readiness Ethereum’s architecture has been shaped by 21 network upgrades and a series of innovations — from smart contracts and DeFi to proof-of-stake and real-world assets tokenized. With over 1 million validators in 84 countries, it is a mainstay of decentralization and security. As trustware becomes the critical infrastructure for global finance, Consensys thinks Ethereum is poised to capture trillions of value — and ETH holders are just beginning.",btcpulse,https://btc-pulse.com/ethereums-trustware-vision-could-propel-eth-to-15-8k-by-2028-consensys/,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN","Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-07-16T15:01:58,"Bitcoin Has Entered Its Subprime Asset Bubble Phase","Summary Bitcoin's recent rise is driven by speculation and subprime financing, not genuine innovation or adoption, making the rally fragile and risky. Bitcoin ETFs have enabled Wall Street to dominate the asset, undermining its original promise of financial freedom and direct ownership. The current market resembles a 'subprime era' for digital assets, with financial engineering and overleveraged speculation reminiscent of past financial crises. Retail investors are fueling a historic buying spree, but this could end badly as market vulnerabilities and global economic risks mount. While my December short article on Bitcoin led to a drop of around -40%, my latest in March has seen those gains eroded. However, in this article, I will explain why BTC is rising on speculation and a new subprime era of 200+ BTC treasury firms and financial engineering, rather than any new developments. I will also explain how investors buying Bitcoin may be forced to ""own nothing and be happy"". The Bitcoin freedom paradox I warned investors in January 2024 on the release of the Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) that the ""Wall Street Takeover"" was now complete. With the funds being backed by physical coins, it meant that any ETF purchases would mean that funds like BlackRock have to take custody of the physical coins. That is the first iteration of owning nothing and being happy because investors are buying up paper assets for speculative gains and have no right to the actual blockchain version. BlackRock is now the second-largest holder of Bitcoin behind the account attributed to Satoshi Nakamoto, with 700,000 BTC. The real paradox, as I mentioned in previous articles, is that Bitcoin was meant to be a tool for financial freedom. Enthusiasts love to bash fiat currency and talk of sound money, but the sector is now almost completely controlled by a handful of Wall Street-friendly ETF providers and corporations. A well-known phrase over the last years has been the ""You'll Own Nothing and Be Happy"" mantra. This was attributed to the World Economic Forum based on an essay they published, and also to Covid-era videos they released to map out a post-2030 world reliant on the sharing economy. It should not be lost on BTC investors that BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has had close ties to the economic group over the years, including being the group's trustee . What could usher in an era of ""owning nothing"", more than the largest retail stock buying spree in the history of mankind, alongside huge investment flows into thousands of digital tokens with no real-world value? Instead of buying tangible assets, investors are piling into tech stocks and the digital ecosystem, which are both overvalued in my opinion. Bitcoin enters its subprime era Not only has Bitcoin been taken over by Wall Street, but its arrival has now ushered in the digital asset's subprime era. The housing crisis in 2007 showed the likely end goal of tangible assets that are owned and leveraged by hedge funds and investment banks. As large ETF providers and investment managers enter the industry, sophisticated financial engineering in Bitcoin has begun. Short-selling hedge fund guru Jim Chanos has been vocally critical of Strategy ( MSTR ) stock's founder, Michael Saylor, for his current balance sheet maneuvers. Talking on a Bloomberg podcast , Chanos talked of the risk in the company's valuation and the fact that investors are happy to pay for shares that cost almost double the Net Asset Value of the company's BTC holdings. It was stated in the podcast that there are now over 200 ""copycat"" companies replicating this strategy. But cheap debt is only possible as BTC is rising, and in the next downturn, stocks will have to be diluted, and quarterly earnings driven by coin appreciation will disappear. Saylor referred to his new approach as ""intelligent leverage"", where the company has issued more than $6bn in convertible bonds solely to purchase BTC. On the other side of that trade are arbitrageurs, who may short the stock or apply options strategies to lock in some extra premium. All of this is hugely disconnected from the original use case of BTC. Chanos decided to short Strategy, but to hedge it with the physical Bitcoin, which is the opposite of what investors are doing now. He also previously referred to the coin as a “libertarian fantasy.” He stated that if the fiat currency system crashed, he wouldn't want Bitcoin. “Food would work the best,” he said. The curious case of founders and whales The other huge red flag in Bitcoin is the story of its supposed founder, Satoshi Nakamoto. Nakamoto is said to be the largest holder of BTC with 1.2 million coins and disappeared in 2011. Nakamoto emailed a colleague to say he had “moved on to other things” and was never heard of again. His current stash of coins remains untouched and would be worth up to $100 billion in today's prices. Investors can believe that story if they want, but in my view, it is a fantasy. Interestingly enough, we saw movement in some other 2011 Bitcoin holdings that had been untouched. It takes a very patient investor with no material desires to sit on a 14 million percent price hike, but that's the next tale. Data from the blockchain showed that three addresses originating from the same owner shifted 23,377 BTC last week. This is the first activity in the coin since April 2011, when BTC traded at $0.78. Analysts are saying that the move is based on security upgrades, but the timing seems strange, in my opinion. More on that speculation In my December short article, I noted the current setup of the ""Buffett Indicator"", which appears to be arriving right on time for a 2,000-style market top. I also noted it in a February short article on tech stocks, ahead of the market's collapse. That dump into April should have been a warning to investors of the market's fragility, but we are now seeing another push higher, with retail investors buying the dip. In the first half of 2025, retail investors traded a record $6.6 trillion in stocks. The cumulative flow of retail money into ETFs and single stocks was estimated at $137.6 billion to $155.3 billion. Meanwhile, in a recent investor survey , 70% of participants believe that markets will be higher in twelve months and are cutting back on other spending habits to invest in the markets. I believe we are watching one of the largest wealth transfers in world history, which could end very badly for small investors. Possible steps to owning nothing As we saw from February to April, the market rally is technically vulnerable to bad news. That was a mild tariff dispute that has since been remedied with very little damage to the global economy, but many storm clouds are looming in government spending and debt. The U.S. debt is ballooning, but President Trump's huge spending bill is set to delay any near-term issues. However, we have seen cracks in the Japanese bond market, while countries such as the United Kingdom are undergoing fiscal chaos . Like the subprime crisis in 2007, or the tech market rally that was halted by the Russia/Ukraine conflict, I believe that we are only a few bad headlines away from another severe downturn. As we saw in 2021-22, Bitcoin is following the Nasdaq almost perfectly and will follow tech stocks down again in a downturn. In my opinion, investors paying for leveraged coins at these levels could see their investments crushed in Bitcoin treasury companies, and ETF flows could grind to a halt, with the majority of late investors underwater. At that point, nothing is off the table, and in the right crisis, the release of a government-approved USD stablecoin could arrive, allowing you to transfer your beaten-down crypto into a safe USD asset at a fraction of its previous worth. At that point, “You Will Own Nothing and You Will Be Happy.” This may not be far away, as President Trump's GENIUS Act has set the stage for stablecoin regulation in the United States, where banks can issue a digital dollar. Federal Reserve policymakers are also touting stablecoins as being ""good for competition"". The market is moving into an all-time high ahead of the so-called ""crypto week"" in Congress, and history may mark that as an important turning point. Risks to the short thesis The obvious risk at the moment is that I believe we are at the tail end of a speculative move that continues higher while stocks remain elevated. We also have the fact that there is limited selling appetite and a retail thirst for ETF investments, alongside the growing investment flows from the BTC treasury companies. I would be a short-term speculator of BTC, but I believe long-term holders will be punished. Conclusion Investors should know how the game ends when an anonymous account and a handful of large Wall Street investment firms now control Bitcoin. Worse still, we are now entering the subprime phase, where Bitcoin treasury companies are leveraging their balance sheet to purchase the digital currency in the belief that it can only go higher. That was the prevailing belief on the housing market in 2007. Adding to the subprime-era connection, we are seeing record levels of retail investor interest, and everyday consumerism is being shunned to buy into this rally at record highs. Unfortunately, many investors in this game may be left owning nothing, whether they have physical or paper assets.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4801628-bitcoin-has-entered-its-subprime-asset-bubble-phase?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","BTC-USD|MSTR",cryptocompare
2025-07-16T14:59:15,"Jim Chanos Calls Strategy’s Premium 'Financial Gibberish'","Disclaimer: The analyst who wrote this article owns shares in Strategy. Jim Chanos , the founder of Kynikos Associates who famously shorted U.S. energy giant Enron before it collapsed in 2001, has set his sights on Strategy (MSTR), arguing the bitcoin (BTC)-buying company’s premium valuation over its holdings of the largest cryptocurrency is unjustified. Chanos has placed a bet against Strategy’s stock by shorting it while maintaining a long position in bitcoin itself, aiming to profit if the company’s premium valuation shrinks. In shorting, a trader borrows stock, sells it and hopes the price falls enough for them to buy it back in time to return to the lender while leaving them with a profit. The investor has earned a reputation for spotting corporate frauds and overvalued companies. Enron, once a major U.S. energy firm, collapsed amid massive accounting fraud , wiping out billions in value and sending top executives to prison, becoming a lasting symbol of corporate scandal. He criticized the financial maneuvers of Strategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, who has sold convertible debt and preferred shares to raise money to buy more bitcoin, calling them “financial gibberish” and warning that the sales create risks for shareholders. Strategy has accumulated more than 600,000 bitcoins , far surpassing its closest competitors. In a debate on the We Study Billionaires podcast , Chanos clashed with Pierre Rochard , CEO of Bitcoin Bond Co. and a well-known bitcoin advocate, over Strategy's roughly 1.9 times net asset value premium. According to Chanos, the company offers nothing unique beyond owning bitcoin, and contends the premium should disappear as more than 140 other firms worldwide, including MARA Holdings (MARA), Riot Platforms (RIOT) and Metaplanet (3350), pursue similar treasury strategies. Rochard, however, sees Strategy’s large bitcoin stash and first-mover advantage as key strengths. He argued the company can raise significant debt without diluting shareholders and that investors view Strategy as a leveraged play on BTC, akin to holding a call option for potential upside. Rochard also suggest that crypto-friendly policies under the administration of President Trump could attract more investment into the industry, boosting Strategy’s appeal. While Chanos insisted direct bitcoin ownership is safer and simpler, Rochard countered that Strategy’s size enables it to leverage more efficiently than individual investors.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/16/jim-chanos-calls-strategys-premium-financial-gibberish,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Markets|MicroStrategy|Short|Bitcoin|Digital Asset Treasury|News",cryptocompare

2025-07-16T14:56:57,"Swedish Refine Group Launches $1M Bitcoin Treasury Strategy","Swedish digital commerce company Refine Group AB has launched a Bitcoin treasury strategy backed by $1 million in fresh capital. The Stockholm-based company raised 10 million Swedish krona through a directed share issue to fund its initial Bitcoin purchases, establishing a new Digital Assets business area alongside its existing Products and Digital Services divisions. Refine’s board of directors resolved to issue 54.37 million shares at 0.1839 krona per share, representing a 20% discount to the seven-day volume-weighted average price of 0.2299 krona, according to the company’s official press release . The company joins other publicly-traded firms that have adopted Bitcoin treasury strategies, including MicroStrategy and Japan’s Metaplanet . Source: Refine Group Strategic Positioning and Capital Structure Refine Group’s treasury strategy centers on accumulating Bitcoin as a core reserve asset while maintaining focus on its traditional digital commerce operations. The company introduced a new performance metric, “Bitcoin per Share,” to track its ability to create long-term shareholder value through strategic Bitcoin accumulation. Chief Executive Officer David Wallinder emphasized the strategic rationale behind the decision, stating that “Bitcoin’s scarcity and global liquidity make it a powerful complement to traditional cash management, and we look forward to continuing expanding this business area.” The directed share issue attracted significant interest from both new strategic investors and existing shareholders, with all shares in the offering fully subscribed. Caldas Capital, led by entrepreneur João Caldas, emerged as the largest participant in the funding round and is set to become Refine’s largest shareholder following the transaction. Caldas brings substantial experience in both traditional business and cryptocurrency markets, having previously founded and sold cosmetics manufacturer Fancy Stage to Humble Group for approximately 550 million krona. His involvement includes both strategic capital and financial expertise, with existing shareholders representing 20% of the company already expressing intentions to propose his appointment to the board of directors. The share issuance will increase Refine’s outstanding shares from 67.5 million to 121.9 million, resulting in approximately 45% dilution for existing shareholders. The company’s share capital will rise from 6.75 million krona to 12.19 million krona following completion of the transaction. Growing European Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Refine Group’s Bitcoin adoption is part of a broader institutional acceptance of cryptocurrency treasury strategies across Europe, particularly in Nordic markets where regulatory frameworks have shown relative clarity. The company joins H100 Group , which became Sweden’s first publicly listed Bitcoin treasury firm in May 2025 after acquiring 4.39 BTC, worth approximately $475,000. This corporate adoption trend coincides with political developments in Sweden, where lawmakers have urged the government to explore establishing a national Bitcoin reserve . Swedish MP Rickard Nordin has introduced a motion to add Bitcoin Reserve to Sweden’s national holdings, citing economic uncertainty and the need for fiscal diversification. #CryptoRegulation #BitcoinReserve https://t.co/anQdwjNVrO — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 11, 2025 Members of Parliament Dennis Dioukarev and Rickard Nordin submitted letters to Finance Minister Elisabeth Svantesson in April, proposing that Sweden begin accumulating Bitcoin through direct policy or budget-neutral methods such as retaining seized cryptocurrency assets. The Nordic momentum extends beyond Sweden, with nine UK-listed companies announcing Bitcoin treasury plans in recent weeks alone. These developments suggest growing corporate confidence in Bitcoin’s role as a digital store of value, even as traditional financial institutions remain cautious about their exposure to cryptocurrency. The trend extends beyond Europe, with companies like France’s Blockchain Group raising $7.7 million for Bitcoin treasury expansion and targeting 260,000 BTC by 2033. Meanwhile, Asian companies, such as Japan’s Metaplanet, and global technology firms are increasingly viewing Bitcoin as a hedge against currency devaluation and inflation. Countries, governments, and institutions are increasingly adopting Bitcoin as a treasury, and the corporate adoption of Bitcoin treasury strategies will likely accelerate further, especially during the current rally.

2025-07-16T14:55:10,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Rebounds After Tuesday Decline, Reclaims $118,000","Bitcoin (BTC) has recovered after a substantial decline on Tuesday, when it plunged to a low of $115,701 before settling at $117,682. The flagship cryptocurrency is up almost 1% during the current session, trading around $118,447. Despite Tuesday’s decline, analysts believe it is unlikely for BTC to see a prolonged correction in the near term. Cantor Fitzgerald Closes In On Deal With Early Bitcoin Supporter Brandon Lutnick, Chair of Cantor Fitzgerald and son of US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, is closing in on a $4 billion deal with an early Bitcoin supporter to buy billions worth of BTC using a blank cheque vehicle backed by Cantor Fitzgerald. Cantor Equity Partners 1, a black cheque vehicle that raised over $200 million in an initial public offering, is in late-stage talks with Adam Beck, founder of Blockstream Capital, to buy $3 billion in Bitcoin. The deal mirrors a deal Brandon struck with SoftBank and Tether in April, advancing Cantor Fitzgerald’s strategy of using publicly-listed shell companies to buy Bitcoin. The deal could see Beck contribute 30,000 BTC to Cantor Equity Partners 1, worth over $3 billion, part of a broader deal with the blank cheque company to raise as much as $800 million in outside capital to fund future Bitcoin purchases. Beck and Blockstream would contribute their holdings in exchange for shares in the Cantor vehicle. According to sources, a deal could be concluded as early as this week. The deal will make Cantor one of the world’s largest and most active Bitcoin buyers, using blank cheque vehicles led by Brandon, who was named chair after his father, Howard Lutnick, joined the Trump administration. Crypto Spot Trading Down Despite Bitcoin Rally Crypto spot trading fell 22% in Q2 2025, extending its decline despite ongoing bullish sentiment. Crypto spot trading fell from $5.3 trillion in Q4 2024 to $4.6 trillion in Q1 2025. Spot crypto trading volumes on major centralized exchanges fell even further, dropping to $3.6 trillion in Q2, according to data from crypto analytics platform TokenInsight. The downturn in spot market trading comes amid a decline in altcoin trading activity and liquidity in Q2, contrasting with the resilience in the derivatives market. “Traders maintained their Q1 preference for high-frequency derivatives trading amid market uncertainty, aiming to hedge risks and leverage volatility.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) ended the weekend on a bullish note, registering an increase of nearly 2% and settling at $118,624. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as the price surged to an intraday high of $123,091 before declining and settling at $119,714. Selling pressure returned on Tuesday as traders locked in their profits after the flagship cryptocurrency surged to record levels. As a result, BTC fell to an intraday low of $115,701 before settling at $117,682. Despite Monday’s substantial drop, analysts don’t believe Bitcoin will enter a downtrend anytime soon. According to analysts from 21Shares, robust fundamentals are supporting the cryptocurrency’s current trajectory. “The structural imbalance between surging demand and a rapidly vanishing supply base makes a prolonged correction increasingly unlikely. There are far more positives than negatives right now.” According to Matt Mena, the current rally is being driven by spot Bitcoin ETFs and Bitcoin treasury companies, with retail demand almost absent. “US-listed Bitcoin ETFs have already absorbed several multiples of the BTC that will be mined this year. That doesn’t even include corporate treasury buyers, who continue to add quietly in the background.” While Mena believes BTC’s bullish trajectory will continue, he cautioned that a reversal cannot be ruled out due to macroeconomic factors. “It is certainly possible that Bitcoin consolidates, or even sees a pullback. If Trump’s proposed tariffs end up being more severe than markets currently anticipate, or if Powell signals that rate cuts are further off than expected, we could see risk assets broadly reprice lower, including Bitcoin.” BTC crossed $110,000 on Thursday (July 3) but lost momentum after reaching this level and fell 1.41% to $108,097 on Friday. The price recovered over the weekend, rising 0.19% on Saturday and nearly 1% on Sunday to settle at $109,231. Despite the positive weekend, BTC was back in the red on Monday, dropping almost 1% to 108,273. It recovered on Tuesday, rising 0.62% and settling at $108,942. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as the price rose over 2% to cross $111,000 and settle at $111,255. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC registered a 3.51% increase and moved to $115,159. Source: TradingView BTC continued pushing higher on Friday, rising 1.50% to cross $116,000 and settle at $116,885. Despite the positive sentiment, the price registered a marginal decline on Saturday. However, it recovered on Sunday, rising nearly 2% to cross $118,000 and settle at $118,624. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as BTC surged past $120,000 to set a new all-time high of $123,091 before declining and settling at $119,814, ultimately registering an increase of 0.92%. Selling pressure returned on Tuesday as BTC plunged to a low of $115,701 before settling at $117,682. The current session sees BTC up nearly 1%, trading around $118,417.

However, the dominance metric slid in the past week, as ETH and top altcoins strengthened. The dominance of BTC peaked above 63%, later declining rapidly as liquidity shifted to ETH. While a full altcoin season is still far from the current price levels, there are signs that selected coins, tokens, and projects are starting to outperform. BTC dominance returned to 61.6% based on Coingecko data, while the altcoin season index is at 36 points, up from 25 points in June. Currently, the index has moved out of the range of a full Bitcoin season, driven by ETH, SOL, and XRP. However, even smaller assets and the meme market are enjoying increased hype.

Some of the best performers included meme tokens, especially Pudgy Penguins (PENGU). Several memes also bounced from their lows with robust gains, including SPX, WIF, BONK, and MOG. The other class of outperforming tokens belonged to DeFi and DEX, including HYPE, AAVE, MORPHO, and others. Unlike previous altcoin seasons, this time investors are following several clear trends. Blue chip tokens like ETH, SOL, and XRP, along with several other assets, are closely watched for signs of ETF launches. Even coins from older bull seasons can hope for a recovery in the case of an ETF approval. Assets from older cycles like IOTA and XMR also outperformed BTC on a quarterly basis. Appetite for risk is increasing, showing altcoins are never really abandoned. Altcoin seasons are still short-lived Even with enthusiasm for altcoins, a full season may be short-lived. The expectation for peak valuations and rallies has ranged from 4 to 8 weeks historically. The last full altcoin season happened in 2023, with smaller rallies in between. Altcoins and tokens are also reassessing their strength. As of July 16, most crypto assets remain neutral based on their relative strength index. Few tokens are overbought or oversold. Some, like SUI, SOL, XRP, ARB, and JUP, are showing strength, based on their usage and utility. This time, the altcoin season may take into account real-world applications and usage. Apps and platforms producing significant fees remain preferable, as their tokens are supported by real economic activity. Fewer VC-backed tokens are launching on the market, removing some of the burden of value extraction. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-07-16T14:41:09,"Investment Firm Ark Invest Makes Significant Sell-Offs in Both Coinbase Shares and Its Own Spot Bitcoin ETF, ARKB! Details Here","Cathie Wood-led investment firm Ark Invest has seen significant sell-offs in both Coinbase (COIN) shares and its own spot Bitcoin ETF, ARKB. Ark Invest Sells $1 Million in Coinbase Stock and Its Own Bitcoin ETF The company raised approximately $13.3 million by selling 34,207 Coinbase shares and $8.7 million by selling 225,742 ARKB shares. The sales came just after both Bitcoin and Coinbase reached all-time highs. Ark Invest maintains a strategy of not exceeding 10% of any asset weight in its funds. This policy aims to maintain portfolio diversity and involves regular rebalancing in the event of significant increases or decreases in asset value. According to the company's latest data, Coinbase stock makes up 7.9% of the ARKW fund, worth approximately $172.8 million. Robinhood, the fund's largest holding, is 8%, worth $175.5 million. Coinbase shares rose 1.8% to a record $394.01 on Monday, pushing the company's market capitalization past $100 billion for the first time. However, on Tuesday, the shares fell 1.5% to $388.02. In the past month, the shares have gained more than 50%, fueled by Bitcoin's record-breaking rally and the notable IPO of its stablecoin partner, Circle. Ark Also Sells Out of Its Bitcoin ETF Ark Invest also sold $8.7 million of its own spot Bitcoin ETF, ARKB, from the same fund on Tuesday. The sale coincided with Bitcoin's recent breakout above $123,000 on Monday, followed by a drop below $116,000 on Tuesday. ARKB is the fourth largest position, accounting for 7.2% of the ARKW fund and worth approximately $157.2 million. Strong Inflows Continue into Bitcoin ETFs On Tuesday, ARKB saw net outflows of $6.2 million, while spot Bitcoin ETFs saw net inflows of $403.1 million. BlackRock's IBIT ETF led the inflows, contributing $416.3 million. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen inflows for the past nine days, raising a total of $4.4 billion. Since their launch in January 2024, the ETFs have seen total net inflows exceeding $53.3 billion. ARKB accounts for $2.9 billion of this figure and currently manages $5 billion in assets. BRN chief analyst Valentin Fournier made the following statement in his assessment: “ETF inflows are strong, altcoins are gaining momentum, and sentiment is high on macro optimism. Bitcoin has more room to top, but in the short term, we're leaving the stage to altcoins.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-16T14:37:15,"Hackers Exploit BigONE’s Systems, Steal Millions in Bitcoin and Ethereum","Crypto exchange BigONE has reported a security breach involving its hot wallet infrastructure, which resulted in an estimated $27 million loss. The incident was detected by blockchain security platform SlowMist on July 16. Hot Wallet Nightmare SlowMist said that the production network was compromised, and the operating logic of account and risk control-related servers was modified, which allowed the attacker withdraw funds. BigONE confirmed the breach after the exchange’s real-time monitoring system flagged abnormal asset movements and said it was caused by a third-party attack. The exchange, however, stated that all private keys remain secure and the attack path has been identified and contained to prevent further losses. The exchange said that it is working with SlowMist to trace the attacker’s wallet addresses and monitor the movement of the stolen funds, which include 120 BTC, 350 ETH, and over 8 million USDT across four networks. In a statement, BigONE has vowed to cover all user losses using its internal security reserves. The exchange said it aims to ensure that user assets remain intact while it continues investigations. After a temporary suspension, the platform restored its services. BigONE exec Alex Ash stated , “The system upgrade has been successfully completed. Deposit and trading services have now been fully restored, and you may log in via Web or App to resume your transactions. Thank you for your patience and continued support.” On-chain sleuth ZachXBT remarked that he does not sympathize with the exchange, and alleged that it processed significant volumes tied to pig butchering, romance, and investment scams. He added that if more “questionable” offshore exchanges like MEXC or KuCoin were hacked for large sums, it could benefit the crypto industry by acting as a “natural cleanse” without requiring government intervention. GMX Hack The incident comes days after decentralized trading platform GMX was exploited for $42 million. The hacker, however, returned $40.5 million less than 48 hours after the exploit. The penetration vector included a re-entrancy vulnerability in GMX’s V1 smart contracts on July , allowing the perpetrator to manipulate GLP token prices to drain funds. They later bridged them from Arbitrum to Ethereum. GMX offered a 10% white hat bounty in exchange for the stolen assets, which the hacker accepted, keeping a profit of about $4.5 million. GMX confirmed its V2 protocol was not affected by the incident.
