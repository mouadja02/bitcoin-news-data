However, the Democrats’ about-face reflects growing unease within the party.Although revisions were made to the bill after its committee approval to address Democratic concerns, the lawmakers said the changes fell short. They called for stronger safeguards related to Anti-Money Laundering, national security, foreign issuers, and accountability measures for noncompliant actors.The statement was also signed by Senators Raphael Warnock, Catherine Cortez Masto, Ben Ray Luján, John Hickenlooper and Adam Schiff.A copy of the statement.

Fintech giants are investing in Bitcoin mining rather than just accumulating the asset, all thanks to the favorable regulatory environment in the US and the profitability margin of BTC. Then, numerous companies are diversifying by allocating computing power to AI, further strengthening their economics and, thus, investment attractiveness. For now, it looks like the future of the foundational layer for the Bitcoin network could mark the new gusher age.Is Bitcoin mining profitable?Bitcoin mining is still profitable. CoinShares, a digital asset investment firm, shared that the average cost to mine 1 BTC for US-listed miners reached $55,950 in Q3 2024. Two other popular models — one from MacroMicro and another dubbed the Glassnode Difficulty Regression Model — give different estimates. On the very same day of Feb. 20, MacroMicro.me data shows that the average cost to produce 1 BTC hovers above $92,000; Glassnode’s Difficulty Regression Model estimates the cost to mine a single BTC at approximately $34,400, all while the cryptocurrency’s price hit $98,300 on that day.On a global scale, mining costs differ based on the region. For example, the electricity cost to produce 1 BTC in Ireland is roughly $321,000, but it costs just over $1,300 to mine 1 BTC in Iran. Electricity is only part of the equation — hardware, labor and maintenance costs also play a crucial role.Recent data from CoinShares and MacroMicro.me paints a challenging yet nuanced picture for Bitcoin miners in the United States. While some institutional miners remain profitable, the broader landscape reveals increasing operational pressures that could reshape the mining industry.What happens if the challenges aren’t addressed? Mining institutions with high profitability rates could start to expand their operations and possibly acquire struggling miners at bargain prices, potentially putting retail and smaller miners at risk.Sustainable economics for investment attractivenessIn addition to receiving the block rewards, miners also benefit from the Bitcoin network’s transaction fees, which depend on network usage. Data shows that the daily Bitcoin transaction fees have been hovering between $360,000 and $1.3 million over the past month — reaching an average of $595,000 daily. This additional revenue stream bolsters Bitcoin mining’s economic appeal and strengthens the resilience of the mining business model by diversifying income sources.Recent: Bitcoin miner Bitfarms secures up to $300M loan from MacquarieIt’s not only mining that mining hardware is used for. High computational power, captive power supplies and ready-made infrastructure make miners uniquely equipped to support AI and high-performance computing. In simple terms, mining firms can now rent out their hardware to process AI tasks instead of only focusing on mining Bitcoin.The combination of transaction fee revenue growth and AI computing diversification creates a more resilient and profitable industry model (the existing one has never been quite appealing to institutional investments in the US). Institutional investments on the riseThe appealing revenues in the Bitcoin mining industries brought huge attention from institutional investors. This process is easy to spot: Bitcoin mining pools in the US accounted for over 40% of the global Bitcoin network’s hashrate in 2024. According to research by EY-Parthenon and Coinbase, 83% of the 352 global institutions plan to increase their crypto allocations this year, while 51% of the asset managers are considering investments in digital asset companies, including mining companies. That’s why I’m not surprised to witness huge investments in Riot Platforms, CoreWeave and other mining industry players. The favorable market sentiment has paved the way for more initial public offerings (IPOs) and specialized funds targeting mining companies. In addition to securing the $650-million investment, CoreWeave aims to go public with a $4-billion IPO to help the Nvidia-backed company reach a $35-billion valuation.Bgin Blockchain, a Singapore-based crypto miner manufacturer, recently filed to go public in the US. Renaissance Capital, an investment advisory firm, expects Bgin Blockchain to raise $50 million for its IPO.This surge in institutional momentum is set to benefit the Bitcoin mining industry by driving up demand and tightening available supply on the market. As more large players accumulate and hold Bitcoin, market scarcity could increase, supporting higher prices and, in turn, boosting miner profitability.The future optimism is more than tangibleThe strong support from institutional investors comes as the optimism around crypto-friendly policies has significantly increased after Donald Trump won the US presidential elections in November 2024.Establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in early March, seen as a massive policy shift, triggered positivity in the crypto and mining sectors. This sector gained importance. Last year, Bitcoin mining operations significantly contributed to the US economy, generating roughly $4.1 billion in gross domestic product and creating over 31,000 jobs nationwide. The industry is also revitalizing rural areas by generating tax revenue and repurposing remote locations for mining operations. It sounds like the gusher days of the oil industry a century ago, doesn’t it?The latest investments, leadership appointments and IPOs show that Bitcoin mining firms have a significant tailwind. Meanwhile, they are no longer just about BTC — they are becoming data infrastructure providers for the AI sector, turning into hybrid data processing giants.Taking advantage of this shift, the US could potentially become the leader in the digital asset and Bitcoin mining space due to the pro-crypto stance of the Trump administration and fulfill its stated goal of being the “crypto capital of the world.”As institutions double down on Bitcoin mining and AI convergence, the question isn’t if this industry will evolve but who will lead the charge. The modern digital gold rush is underway, and the smartest capital is already claiming it.Opinion by: Fakhul Miah, managing director of GoMining Institutional.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

In simple terms, mining firms can now rent out their hardware to process AI tasks instead of only focusing on mining Bitcoin.The combination of transaction fee revenue growth and AI computing diversification creates a more resilient and profitable industry model (the existing one has never been quite appealing to institutional investments in the US). Institutional investments on the riseThe appealing revenues in the Bitcoin mining industries brought huge attention from institutional investors. This process is easy to spot: Bitcoin mining pools in the US accounted for over 40% of the global Bitcoin network’s hashrate in 2024. According to research by EY-Parthenon and Coinbase, 83% of the 352 global institutions plan to increase their crypto allocations this year, while 51% of the asset managers are considering investments in digital asset companies, including mining companies. That’s why I’m not surprised to witness huge investments in Riot Platforms, CoreWeave and other mining industry players. The favorable market sentiment has paved the way for more initial public offerings (IPOs) and specialized funds targeting mining companies. In addition to securing the $650-million investment, CoreWeave aims to go public with a $4-billion IPO to help the Nvidia-backed company reach a $35-billion valuation.Bgin Blockchain, a Singapore-based crypto miner manufacturer, recently filed to go public in the US. Renaissance Capital, an investment advisory firm, expects Bgin Blockchain to raise $50 million for its IPO.This surge in institutional momentum is set to benefit the Bitcoin mining industry by driving up demand and tightening available supply on the market. As more large players accumulate and hold Bitcoin, market scarcity could increase, supporting higher prices and, in turn, boosting miner profitability.The future optimism is more than tangibleThe strong support from institutional investors comes as the optimism around crypto-friendly policies has significantly increased after Donald Trump won the US presidential elections in November 2024.Establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in early March, seen as a massive policy shift, triggered positivity in the crypto and mining sectors. This sector gained importance. Last year, Bitcoin mining operations significantly contributed to the US economy, generating roughly $4.1 billion in gross domestic product and creating over 31,000 jobs nationwide. The industry is also revitalizing rural areas by generating tax revenue and repurposing remote locations for mining operations. It sounds like the gusher days of the oil industry a century ago, doesn’t it?The latest investments, leadership appointments and IPOs show that Bitcoin mining firms have a significant tailwind. Meanwhile, they are no longer just about BTC — they are becoming data infrastructure providers for the AI sector, turning into hybrid data processing giants.Taking advantage of this shift, the US could potentially become the leader in the digital asset and Bitcoin mining space due to the pro-crypto stance of the Trump administration and fulfill its stated goal of being the “crypto capital of the world.”As institutions double down on Bitcoin mining and AI convergence, the question isn’t if this industry will evolve but who will lead the charge. The modern digital gold rush is underway, and the smartest capital is already claiming it.Opinion by: Fakhul Miah, managing director of GoMining Institutional.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-03T13:15:00.000Z,"What is a sealed-bid token launch?","What are the various methods for launching crypto tokens?              Launching a new token is a critical step for any blockchain project. Token launches enable projects to offer their native assets to early users, investors or supporters while securing capital or encouraging community growth. From initial coin offerings (ICOs) to fair launches and airdrops, each approach carries different levels of transparency, accessibility and risk. Since projects differ in their goals and target communities, several token launch models have evolved over time. Some focus on decentralization and wide community offering, while others aim for optimized fundraising or targeted allocation. Elements such as market swings, bot interference and regulatory pressures influence how tokens are brought to the market.The sealed-bid token launch is a growing trend in this crypto fundraising landscape. Unlike public presales or airdrops, where participants see pricing or allocation terms in advance, sealed-bid models keep each bid confidential until the process ends. This approach is increasingly favored for enabling better price discovery, limiting front-running and curbing manipulation, especially for in-demand tokens.Did you know? Sealed-bid auctions are a crypto twist on traditional finance. They have been used for government bond sales and initial public offerings (IPOs). Now they are redefining token launches by hiding bidder-related information and transparency.                  Sealed-bid token launch, explained              A sealed-bid token launch is a method of distributing cryptocurrency tokens where participants submit private bids without knowing what others are offering. This approach, derived from traditional sealed-bid auctions, involves participants offering secret bids, and the highest bidder typically wins. Auction systems, such as sealed-bid launches, are increasingly built on blockchain platforms like Ethereum, using privacy-enhancing technologies such as Zama’s fhEVM (fully homomorphic Ethereum Virtual Machine) to ensure confidentiality and fairness. Unlike open auctions, where public visibility can escalate prices through bidding wars, sealed-bid formats prevent strategic bidding based on competitors’ actions. In crypto, a sealed-bid token launch leads to fair and transparent token allocation, minimizing price manipulation and front-running. Systems enforce a single bid per participant by leveraging cryptographic techniques like commitments and smart contract logic to prevent multiple bids and enforce payment obligations. Each participant specifies desired token quantities and prices. After the bidding window closes, bids are revealed and assessed using predefined rules, like clearing prices or allocation tiers. This method often reduces bot interference and promotes equitable access during high-demand launches.A key feature of a sealed-bid token launch is its “one-shot” bidding process. Bidders cannot revise their offers or view others’ bids beforehand, which sets up a level playing field. However, it also brings in strategic uncertainty, as participants must estimate optimal bids without cues about other bids. In April 2024, Conor McGregor fundraised for his memecoin REAL using a sealed-bid launch. The mixed martial arts icon introduced the fundraising through a sealed-bid token auction to prevent bots and snipers from manipulating the sale. The project hoped to promote transparency and integrity in a space often plagued by front-running and rug pulls.While the project didn’t disclose token lock-up details, the sealed-bid format and focus on long-term engagement suggest a strategic attempt to execute a transparent and more community-driven launch.                  How do sealed-bid token launches work?              Sealed-bid token launches follow a structured process that minimizes the chances of manipulation and ensures transparency. Here is how the process usually unfolds:Step 1 (Project announcement): The crypto project typically announces the sealed-bid token sale through its official website, social media channels like X, or platforms like Binance Launchpad. It outlines details such as the number of tokens available, bidding timeline, minimum and maximum bid limits, and the process of token allocation.Step 2 (Private bid submission): Participants submit bids to an auctioneer on the platform by providing secret bids before a deadline. Each bid includes the desired token quantity and the offered price. Participants cannot view other bids, ensuring privacy and reducing strategic manipulation.Step 3 (Bid locking): Once submitted, all bids are locked. This prevents users from changing or withdrawing their bids, reinforcing transparency.Step 4 (Token allocation): Post deadline, the smart contract processes all bids. Tokens are distributed either to the highest bidders or through a pricing model like a clearing price or a tiered allocation. Lower bids may receive a partial allocation or a refund.In McGregor’s fundraising, participants submitted private bids in USDC (USDC) during a limited 28-hour window without knowing what others were offering. Once the auction closed, bids were ranked, and tokens were allocated to the highest bidders until the supply ran out. Such auction systems function on a smart contract that ranks all offers, calculates the cutoff price, and allocates tokens to qualifying bidders. Excess funds are refunded automatically. This onchain process eliminates the need for intermediaries, offering immutability and trustless execution.                  Advantages of sealed-bid token launches              Sealed-bid token launches offer an alternative to other models of token sales. This format has gained popularity in crypto, thanks to its potential to create more balanced token distribution and pricing.Transparency: While individual bids remain hidden during the process, all bids and allocations are revealed after the deadline via smart contracts. This ensures onchain verifiability and trust.Reduces gas wars and front-running: Unlike first-come-first-served launches where users race to submit transactions, sealed bids are submitted over a set period. It reduces congestion and the risk of bots exploiting faster access.Encourages fairer price discovery: Since bids are placed without seeing other offers, participants bid based on perceived token value. This mechanism leads to a more organic price that reflects market demand rather than hype or manipulation.Minimizes whale dominance: Sealed bids make it harder for large players to take tokens by simply outbidding small participants in real-time. Prevents manipulation: By removing live price visibility, sealed-bid launches reduce the chances of orchestrated pump-and-dump behavior. It discourages collusion of bidders or biased decisions on the part of the project.Did you know? Sealed-bid launches may evolve with decentralized identity tools. A world might emerge where only verified wallets can bid — combining privacy, fairness and compliance in one go.                  Risks and limitations of sealed-bid tokens              Although sealed-bid token launches introduce a range of benefits, they also entail various risks and compromises. These issues can affect both project teams and participants:Opacity at the initial stage: Since bids remain confidential until the sale concludes, some users might feel lost, unaware of what other people are bidding.Complexity: Sealed-bid auctions can be complex and less transparent to average investors. This complexity may deter participation, especially from those unfamiliar with such mechanisms.Less suitable for small-cap projects: Small-cap projects generally lack an established community. Moreover, small-cap projects rely on viral marketing and word-of-mouth to gain traction, but the closed environment of sealed-bid auctions can dampen momentum.Blockchain-specific risks: As the whole process is executed onchain by a smart contract, blockchain-specific risks such as malfunctioning code and an attacker breaching the network are always present.Risk of underfunding: If the project doesn’t attract enough competitive bids, which is common with lesser-known tokens, it may fall short of funding goals. McGregor’s REAL could raise only 39% of its target.The REAL memecoin, backed by McGregor and launched through a sealed-bid auction, failed to meet its fundraising target, securing only $392,315 — approximately 39% of its $1.008 million goal. Several external factors played a significant role in this outcome. Several external factors contributed significantly to this outcome. Chief among them was the broader downturn in the cryptocurrency market, which coincided with the token’s launch and led to a generally risk-averse investment environment. This was compounded by growing skepticism toward memecoins, as investors became increasingly wary following a series of high-profile scams and failed projects in the space. The celebrity endorsement, while attention-grabbing, may have also backfired — many investors viewed McGregor’s involvement as superficial and questioned the project’s long-term credibility. Additionally, the token’s design raised red flags, particularly its 12-hour unlock window, which resembled patterns seen in pump-and-dump schemes. A lack of transparent communication and insufficient community engagement further weakened investor confidence. While the sealed-bid auction format is designed to ensure fairness and reduce manipulation, its complexity may have posed a barrier to broader participation, particularly among retail investors unfamiliar with the mechanism.                  Use cases of sealed-bid tokens in crypto and future potential              Sealed-bid token launches offer a unique approach to fair token distribution. These launches are gaining attention as an alternative to traditional public sales or airdrops. Their design ensures privacy and minimizes manipulation during high-demand token sales.Here are some prominent use cases of sealed-bid tokens in crypto that reflect their future potential:DAO fundraising and decentralized launchpads: Sealed bids can enhance transparency in fundraising campaigns by decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), thus boosting their credibility. The sealed-bid format reduces front-running and increases trust. Future decentralized launchpads may adopt similar systems to build credibility and avoid hype-driven token launches.KYC and identity integration: As compliance becomes more critical, sealed-bid systems could integrate with Know Your Customer (KYC) or digital identity verification layers. This would allow only verified participants to bid, reducing Sybil attacks and increasing regulatory confidence. Such integration could attract institutional investors and expand access to compliant, fair token sales.Effective for scarce supply tokens: Sealed-bid auctions are most effective when distributing tokens with limited supply. By hiding bid amounts until the auction ends, this method encourages genuine price discovery and prevents bots or whales from dominating the sale.As the crypto space matures, sealed-bid launches may become a standard for transparent and inclusive fundraising.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-a-sealed-bid-token-launch?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3FREFRESH1635508618602&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

This method often reduces bot interference and promotes equitable access during high-demand launches.A key feature of a sealed-bid token launch is its “one-shot” bidding process. Bidders cannot revise their offers or view others’ bids beforehand, which sets up a level playing field. However, it also brings in strategic uncertainty, as participants must estimate optimal bids without cues about other bids. In April 2024, Conor McGregor fundraised for his memecoin REAL using a sealed-bid launch. The mixed martial arts icon introduced the fundraising through a sealed-bid token auction to prevent bots and snipers from manipulating the sale. The project hoped to promote transparency and integrity in a space often plagued by front-running and rug pulls.While the project didn’t disclose token lock-up details, the sealed-bid format and focus on long-term engagement suggest a strategic attempt to execute a transparent and more community-driven launch.                  How do sealed-bid token launches work?              Sealed-bid token launches follow a structured process that minimizes the chances of manipulation and ensures transparency. Here is how the process usually unfolds:Step 1 (Project announcement): The crypto project typically announces the sealed-bid token sale through its official website, social media channels like X, or platforms like Binance Launchpad. It outlines details such as the number of tokens available, bidding timeline, minimum and maximum bid limits, and the process of token allocation.Step 2 (Private bid submission): Participants submit bids to an auctioneer on the platform by providing secret bids before a deadline. Each bid includes the desired token quantity and the offered price. Participants cannot view other bids, ensuring privacy and reducing strategic manipulation.Step 3 (Bid locking): Once submitted, all bids are locked. This prevents users from changing or withdrawing their bids, reinforcing transparency.Step 4 (Token allocation): Post deadline, the smart contract processes all bids. Tokens are distributed either to the highest bidders or through a pricing model like a clearing price or a tiered allocation. Lower bids may receive a partial allocation or a refund.In McGregor’s fundraising, participants submitted private bids in USDC (USDC) during a limited 28-hour window without knowing what others were offering. Once the auction closed, bids were ranked, and tokens were allocated to the highest bidders until the supply ran out. Such auction systems function on a smart contract that ranks all offers, calculates the cutoff price, and allocates tokens to qualifying bidders. Excess funds are refunded automatically. This onchain process eliminates the need for intermediaries, offering immutability and trustless execution.                  Advantages of sealed-bid token launches              Sealed-bid token launches offer an alternative to other models of token sales. This format has gained popularity in crypto, thanks to its potential to create more balanced token distribution and pricing.Transparency: While individual bids remain hidden during the process, all bids and allocations are revealed after the deadline via smart contracts. This ensures onchain verifiability and trust.Reduces gas wars and front-running: Unlike first-come-first-served launches where users race to submit transactions, sealed bids are submitted over a set period. It reduces congestion and the risk of bots exploiting faster access.Encourages fairer price discovery: Since bids are placed without seeing other offers, participants bid based on perceived token value. This mechanism leads to a more organic price that reflects market demand rather than hype or manipulation.Minimizes whale dominance: Sealed bids make it harder for large players to take tokens by simply outbidding small participants in real-time. Prevents manipulation: By removing live price visibility, sealed-bid launches reduce the chances of orchestrated pump-and-dump behavior. It discourages collusion of bidders or biased decisions on the part of the project.Did you know? Sealed-bid launches may evolve with decentralized identity tools. A world might emerge where only verified wallets can bid — combining privacy, fairness and compliance in one go.                  Risks and limitations of sealed-bid tokens              Although sealed-bid token launches introduce a range of benefits, they also entail various risks and compromises. These issues can affect both project teams and participants:Opacity at the initial stage: Since bids remain confidential until the sale concludes, some users might feel lost, unaware of what other people are bidding.Complexity: Sealed-bid auctions can be complex and less transparent to average investors. This complexity may deter participation, especially from those unfamiliar with such mechanisms.Less suitable for small-cap projects: Small-cap projects generally lack an established community. Moreover, small-cap projects rely on viral marketing and word-of-mouth to gain traction, but the closed environment of sealed-bid auctions can dampen momentum.Blockchain-specific risks: As the whole process is executed onchain by a smart contract, blockchain-specific risks such as malfunctioning code and an attacker breaching the network are always present.Risk of underfunding: If the project doesn’t attract enough competitive bids, which is common with lesser-known tokens, it may fall short of funding goals. McGregor’s REAL could raise only 39% of its target.The REAL memecoin, backed by McGregor and launched through a sealed-bid auction, failed to meet its fundraising target, securing only $392,315 — approximately 39% of its $1.008 million goal. Several external factors played a significant role in this outcome. Several external factors contributed significantly to this outcome. Chief among them was the broader downturn in the cryptocurrency market, which coincided with the token’s launch and led to a generally risk-averse investment environment. This was compounded by growing skepticism toward memecoins, as investors became increasingly wary following a series of high-profile scams and failed projects in the space. The celebrity endorsement, while attention-grabbing, may have also backfired — many investors viewed McGregor’s involvement as superficial and questioned the project’s long-term credibility. Additionally, the token’s design raised red flags, particularly its 12-hour unlock window, which resembled patterns seen in pump-and-dump schemes. A lack of transparent communication and insufficient community engagement further weakened investor confidence. While the sealed-bid auction format is designed to ensure fairness and reduce manipulation, its complexity may have posed a barrier to broader participation, particularly among retail investors unfamiliar with the mechanism.                  Use cases of sealed-bid tokens in crypto and future potential              Sealed-bid token launches offer a unique approach to fair token distribution. These launches are gaining attention as an alternative to traditional public sales or airdrops. Their design ensures privacy and minimizes manipulation during high-demand token sales.Here are some prominent use cases of sealed-bid tokens in crypto that reflect their future potential:DAO fundraising and decentralized launchpads: Sealed bids can enhance transparency in fundraising campaigns by decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), thus boosting their credibility. The sealed-bid format reduces front-running and increases trust. Future decentralized launchpads may adopt similar systems to build credibility and avoid hype-driven token launches.KYC and identity integration: As compliance becomes more critical, sealed-bid systems could integrate with Know Your Customer (KYC) or digital identity verification layers. This would allow only verified participants to bid, reducing Sybil attacks and increasing regulatory confidence. Such integration could attract institutional investors and expand access to compliant, fair token sales.Effective for scarce supply tokens: Sealed-bid auctions are most effective when distributing tokens with limited supply. By hiding bid amounts until the auction ends, this method encourages genuine price discovery and prevents bots or whales from dominating the sale.As the crypto space matures, sealed-bid launches may become a standard for transparent and inclusive fundraising.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-a-sealed-bid-token-launch?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

Apple’s continued attempts to interfere with competition will not be tolerated,” US district judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said in an April 30 court filing.“Effective immediately, Apple will no longer impede developers’ ability to communicate with users, nor will they levy or impose a new commission on off-app purchases,” Rogers added.Rogers reiterated, “This is an injunction, not a negotiation. There are no do-overs once a party willfully disregards a court order. Time is of the essence.”Bitcoin is a matter of national security — Deputy CIA directorThe US Central Intelligence Agency is increasingly incorporating Bitcoin (BTC) as a tool in its operations, and working with the cryptocurrency is a matter of national security, Michael Ellis, the agency’s deputy director, told podcast host Anthony Pompliano.In an appearance on the market analyst and investor’s show, Ellis told Pompliano that the intelligence agency works with law enforcement to track BTC, and it is a point of data collection in counter-intelligence operations. Ellis added:“Bitcoin is here to stay — cryptocurrency is here to stay. As you know, more and more institutions are adopting it, and I think that is a great trend. One that this administration has obviously been leaning forward into.”\""It's another area of competition where we need to ensure the United States is well-positioned against China and other adversaries,\"" Ellis said.Although Ellis's comments point to Bitcoin maturing as an asset, they also reflect the increased involvement of governments and institutions in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.

According to a May 2 CNBC report, Lummis said the idea that the US president was offering exclusive access to himself and the White House for people willing to pay for it “gives [her] pause.” She wasn’t the only member of the Republican Party to be critical of Trump’s memecoin perks, announced on April 23, roughly three months after the then-president-elect launched the TRUMP token.  “I don’t think it would be appropriate for me to charge people to come into the Capitol and take a tour,” said Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski, according to NBC News.Despite Lummis’ reported “pause” over the president’s actions, on May 2, she posted a video to X of herself speaking on the Senate floor, saying she was “particularly pleased” by Trump’s support of legislation to establish a strategic Bitcoin (BTC) reserve in the United States. The Boosting Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide, or BITCOIN, Act would seemingly codify Trump’s executive order to create a national crypto reserve.Related: House Democrats want ethics probe on Trump over crypto projectsThe launch of the TRUMP coin on Jan. 17 was met with outrage from many lawmakers and figures in the crypto industry, who pointed to potential conflicts of interest and implications of allowing foreign actors to channel funds directly to Trump. The criticism continued after Trump announced that a group of the top memecoin holders would have the opportunity to apply for a White House tour and dinner. “Trump once claimed he is so rich he cannot be bought,” said Craig Holman, a government ethics expert with the consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen. “But his obsession with money means he apparently can be bought for a meme.”Calls for impeachment over ties to cryptoGeorgia Senator Jon Ossoff, a Democrat, called for Trump’s impeachment during an April 25 town hall, claiming the memecoin dinner represented “selling access for what are effectively payments directly to him.” During his first term, Trump was impeached twice in the House of Representatives but acquitted after the Senate votes fell short of the two-thirds majority required for conviction.At the time of publication, it was unclear who, if any, of the memecoin holders would attend the May 22 dinner with Trump.

2025-05-02T22:20:00.000Z,"Pro-crypto senator pushes back on Trump&#039;s memecoin dinner — Report","Senator Cynthia Lummis and at least one other Republican in Congress are reportedly critical of US President Donald Trump for offering the top holders of his memecoin a dinner and White House tour. According to a May 2 CNBC report, Lummis said the idea that the US president was offering exclusive access to himself and the White House for people willing to pay for it “gives [her] pause.” She wasn’t the only member of the Republican Party to be critical of Trump’s memecoin perks, announced on April 23, roughly three months after the then-president-elect launched the TRUMP token.  “I don’t think it would be appropriate for me to charge people to come into the Capitol and take a tour,” said Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski, according to NBC News.Despite Lummis’ reported “pause” over the president’s actions, on May 2, she posted a video to X of herself speaking on the Senate floor, saying she was “particularly pleased” by Trump’s support of legislation to establish a strategic Bitcoin (BTC) reserve in the United States. The Boosting Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide, or BITCOIN, Act would seemingly codify Trump’s executive order to create a national crypto reserve.Related: House Democrats want ethics probe on Trump over crypto projectsThe launch of the TRUMP coin on Jan. 17 was met with outrage from many lawmakers and figures in the crypto industry, who pointed to potential conflicts of interest and implications of allowing foreign actors to channel funds directly to Trump. The criticism continued after Trump announced that a group of the top memecoin holders would have the opportunity to apply for a White House tour and dinner. “Trump once claimed he is so rich he cannot be bought,” said Craig Holman, a government ethics expert with the consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen. “But his obsession with money means he apparently can be bought for a meme.”Calls for impeachment over ties to cryptoGeorgia Senator Jon Ossoff, a Democrat, called for Trump’s impeachment during an April 25 town hall, claiming the memecoin dinner represented “selling access for what are effectively payments directly to him.” During his first term, Trump was impeached twice in the House of Representatives but acquitted after the Senate votes fell short of the two-thirds majority required for conviction.At the time of publication, it was unclear who, if any, of the memecoin holders would attend the May 22 dinner with Trump. Usernames from the TRUMP leaderboard have led to speculation that staunch supporters like Tron founder Justin Sun and Tesla CEO Elon Musk could be among the attendees.

A VIX score below 18 implied a “risk-on” environment, favoring assets like Bitcoin. Peterson’s model, which had a 95% tracking accuracy, predicted a $135,000 target within the next 100 days if the VIX remains low. This aligns with Bitcoin’s sensitivity to market sentiment, as a low VIX reduces uncertainty, encouraging investment in riskier assets.Speaking on Bitcoin’s volatility, Fidelity’s director of global macro, Jurrien Timmer, compared Bitcoin’s nature to “Dr.Jekyll and Mr.Hyde.” Timmer believed Bitcoin’s ability to act as both a store of value (Dr. Jekyll) and a speculative asset (Mr. Hyde) differentiates it from gold, which remains a consistent “hard money” asset. Timmer emphasized the dynamics between Bitcoin and the global money supply and said, “Note that when M2 has grown and the stock market is rallying, Bitcoin has been off to the races because it has both attributes working for it.

His trial is still set for July, and his fellow charged co-founder, Roman Semenov, is at large and believed to be in Russia.The DeFi Education Fund said that in Storm’s case, the Department of Justice is attempting to hold software developers criminally liable for how others use their code, which is “not only absurd in principle, but it sets a precedent that potentially chills all crypto development in the United States.”The group also called for the recognition that the prosecution contradicts the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) guidance from Trump’s first term, which established that developers of self-custodial, peer-to-peer protocols are not money transmitters. Source: DeFi Education Fund“This kind of legal environment does not just chill innovation — it freezes it,” they argued.

This is a necessary support to watch out for as a solid bounce off the 20-day EMA suggests the bullish sentiment remains intact. That increases the likelihood of a break above $100,000. The pair may then reach $107,000.This optimistic view will be invalidated in the short term if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA.

2025-05-02T17:00:00.000Z,"Why Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust still dominates ETF revenue in 2025","In the annals of financial history, few institutions have faced the tempests of competition with the steadfast resolve of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). Born in 2013 as a private placement, GBTC pioneered regulated Bitcoin investment, granting investors access to Bitcoin’s (BTC) meteoric rise without the perils of digital wallets or unregulated exchanges.On Jan. 11, 2024, it transitioned into a spot Bitcoin ETF following a landmark victory against the SEC. This marked a pivotal moment with the SEC’s view that ETFs can offer lower expense ratios and enhanced tax efficiency compared to traditional funds. Even still, GBTC’s financial resilience shines, generating $268.5 million in annual revenue, surpassing the $211.8 million of all other US spot Bitcoin ETFs combined, despite losing over half its holdings with $18 billion in outflows since early 2024. This is no fleeting triumph of inertia. The numbers tell a tale of paradox. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), with $56 billion in assets under management (AUM) and a 0.25% fee, generated $137 million in 2024 while achieving $35.8 billion in inflows and $1 billion in daily trading volume within weeks of launch. Meanwhile, GBTC’s 1.5% expense ratio, up to seven times higher than competitors, fuels its revenue lead, even though it bled $17.4 billion in outflows, with a record single-day loss of $618 million on March 19, 2024, driven by investors chasing lower fees or capitalizing on the trust’s historical discount to net asset value (NAV), which plummeted from 50% to near zero by July 2024.This clash of revenue dominance and capital flight demands scrutiny, unveiling the intricate dance of investor psychology, market dynamics and Grayscale’s calculated resilience.Yet, GBTC’s $18 billion in AUM and its ability to generate $268.5 million despite significant outflows points to a deeper narrative: tax friction and institutionalized inertia. The inability of companies, family offices and other institutions to quickly pivot due to tax barriers and company directives bubbles to the surface. The $100-billion total spot Bitcoin ETF market points to the stakes of this contest, with Grayscale’s revenue dominance poised to evolve as competition intensifies.Related: The sentiment engine of Bitcoin ETFs is rewiring market structureWhat sustains GBTC’s revenue crown in this crucible of competition? Is it the arithmetic of high fees applied to a still-formidable AUM, the loyalty of battle-scarred investors, or the unseen weight of tax frictions binding them to their positions?As we probe this question, we uncover the mechanics of GBTC’s dominance and the broader currents shaping the future of crypto investment. The answer lies in a potent blend of history, strategy and the unyielding faith of investors in a titan that, against all odds, refuses to yield.GBTC Rev vs. all other ETFs. Source: CoinGlassGrayscale’s high-fee revenue engineAt the core of GBTC’s revenue dominance lies its 1.5% expense ratio, a towering figure beside competitors like IBIT and FBTC (both 0.25%), Bitwise (0.24%) and Franklin Templeton (0.19%).Applied to $17.9 billion in AUM, this fee yields $268.5 million annually, eclipsing the $211.8-million combined revenue of all other US spot Bitcoin ETFs, which manage $89 billion collectively.ETF Store president Nate Geraci remarked on X, “GBTC still making more [money] than all of the other ETFs combined… And it’s not even close.” This arithmetic edge endures despite $21 billion in outflows since January 2024, including a daily average loss of $89.9 million, underscoring the sheer power of high fees on a substantial asset base.Source: Nate GeraciThe fee structure is both GBTC’s bastion and its Achilles’ heel. Before its ETF conversion, GBTC charged 2%, a rate justified by its monopoly as the sole US vehicle for Bitcoin exposure within traditional portfolios. Post-conversion, the 1.5% fee draws ire, with Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research for Morningstar, predicting sustained outflows as investors flock to cheaper alternatives. Grayscale’s counterstroke was the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC), launched in March 2025 with a 0.15% fee (the lowest among US spot Bitcoin ETPs). Seeded with 10% of GBTC’s Bitcoin holdings ($1.7 billion AUM), the Mini Trust has drawn $168.9 million in inflows, targeting cost-conscious investors. However, the Mini Trust’s lower revenue per dollar of AUM ($2.55 million annually) pales beside GBTC’s $268.5 million, reinforcing the latter’s dominance.Grayscale’s dual strategy (high-fee GBTC for revenue, low-fee Mini Trust for retention) reveals a nuanced defense, but the fortress of GBTC’s fees remains unbreached, its revenue crown secure for now.Legacy and loyaltyBeyond the arithmetic of fees, GBTC’s revenue supremacy rests on its storied legacy, the fierce loyalty it inspires and the formidable tax frictions that tether investors to its fold. Since 2013, Grayscale has been the standard-bearer of regulated Bitcoin investment, overcoming regulatory tempests to become the first publicly traded Bitcoin fund in 2015 and the largest spot Bitcoin ETF by AUM ($26 billion) upon its NYSE Arca listing in 2024.Its August 2023 legal victory against the US SEC, which compelled the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, solidified its stature as a pioneer. This legacy resonates with institutional and accredited investors, many of whom entered GBTC during its private placement phase or at steep NAV discounts, forging a bond that endures.Tax considerations form a silent but mighty anchor. Many early GBTC investors purchased shares at low prices, with Bitcoin trading at $800 in 2013 compared to the mid-$90,000 range by May 2025. This roughly 120-fold increase has generated substantial unrealized capital gains, making sales costly.Related: Bitcoin price recovers, Ethereum RWA value up 20%: April in chartsAn investor who purchased 100 shares of GBTC at $10 in 2015 and now sees them valued at $400 each would be sitting on a $39,000 capital gain. Selling those shares to move into a lower-fee ETF like IBIT or FBTC could trigger a tax bill of $7,800 at the 20% long-term capital gains rate typically applied to high-net-worth individuals or $5,850 at the 15% rate for others. This kind of taxable event often discourages redemptions, particularly for long-term holders in taxable accounts.On the other hand, for those holding GBTC in tax-advantaged vehicles such as IRAs or 401(k)s, gains can be deferred and, in the case of Roth IRAs, avoided entirely, making GBTC comparatively more attractive for legacy investors reluctant to switch.Psychological factors amplify these barriers. Loss aversion (the reluctance to realize taxable gains) and loyalty to Grayscale’s brand deter investors from abandoning a vehicle that weathered Bitcoin’s volatility. The closure of the NAV discount (from 50% to near zero in July 2024) spurred outflows as arbitrageurs cashed out. Still, core holders remain, bolstered by trust in Grayscale’s custodianship via Coinbase Custody, which secures $18.08 billion in AUM in May 2024. Its investor base, spanning crypto-native institutions, hedge funds and retail clients via platforms like Fidelity and Schwab, values its simplicity (no crypto wallets required) and regulatory pedigree.While IBIT and FBTC draw new capital with lower fees and liquidity, GBTC retains a niche among those who see it as a battle-tested titan. Former Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein’s claim that outflows are reaching “equilibrium” suggests a stabilizing core, with tax frictions and legacy fortifying retention. In a market driven by innovation, GBTC’s history, bolstered by tax barriers and investor faith, is its shield, guarding its revenue crown against the relentless advance of newer rivals.A historical timeline graphic showing GBTC milestones (2013 launch, 2015 public trading, 2023 SEC victory, 2024 ETF conversion), with Bitcoin price spikes ($800 to $103,000) and AUM growth overlaid.

2025-05-02T15:00:00.000Z,"Free speech is at risk without decentralized, open-source technology","Opinion by: Chris Jenkins, adviser to Pocket NetworkTim Berners-Lee’s vision of the World Wide Web is dead. Instead of an open and accessible global information system, the web is controlled by centralized global data conglomerates, which don’t just restrict free speech but also monetize your data as a price of entry. Web2 firms have built walled gardens with massive information asymmetry between companies and users.Blockchain-based decentralized tech challenges the status quo, offering an alternative to Web2’s closed-source infrastructure. It enables developers and engineers to build a censorship-resistant and accessible open-data web to champion the cause of free speech. Open-source technology creates a paradigmatic shift in a fair and inclusive internet where centralized web companies won’t dictate the terms.A vision deferredIn 1989, Berners-Lee’s invention created a virtual space for collaboration, sharing and learning from one another.

2025-05-02T15:00:00.000Z,"Free speech is at risk without decentralized, open-source technology","Opinion by: Chris Jenkins, adviser to Pocket NetworkTim Berners-Lee’s vision of the World Wide Web is dead. Instead of an open and accessible global information system, the web is controlled by centralized global data conglomerates, which don’t just restrict free speech but also monetize your data as a price of entry. Web2 firms have built walled gardens with massive information asymmetry between companies and users.Blockchain-based decentralized tech challenges the status quo, offering an alternative to Web2’s closed-source infrastructure. It enables developers and engineers to build a censorship-resistant and accessible open-data web to champion the cause of free speech. Open-source technology creates a paradigmatic shift in a fair and inclusive internet where centralized web companies won’t dictate the terms.A vision deferredIn 1989, Berners-Lee’s invention created a virtual space for collaboration, sharing and learning from one another.

2025-05-02T12:54:55.000Z,"Are Donald Trump’s tariffs a legal house of cards?","On Wednesday, speaking from the White House, US President Donald Trump suggested that families scale back on gifts this year.Asked about his tariff program, the president remarked, “Somebody said, ‘Oh, the shelves are gonna be open. Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, and maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more.’”But the toy stores where those dolls are sold might have something to say about it. Earlier in the week, Mischief Toy Store in St. Paul, Minnesota joined a growing number of American small businesses suing the president over his emergency tariff plan.Throughout April, a groundswell of lawsuits led by 13 states further challenged Trump’s ambitious tariff program. Their success or failure rests on hundreds of years of judicial policy and American constitutional law. The legal basis for the Trump tariffsWhen Trump first announced his ambitious tariff program to the world, you might have wondered, Why is he allowed to do this? Well, he may not be. The president’s power to unilaterally impose tariffs is not rooted in the office’s constitutional Article II power. Instead, it is a delegation of authority by Congress. Article I of the US Constitution creates Congress, and Section 8 delegates the authority to “lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises.” For much of the United States’ history, this is precisely what it did — through a series of colorfully named tariff programs like the Tariff of Abominations of 1828, the Dingley Tariff of 1897 and culminating in the infamous Smoot-Hawley Tariff of 1930. At the time, Smoot-Hawley was widely perceived as contributing to the devastation of the Great Depression. As a consequence, Congress’s use of tariffs became viewed as corrosively political and dysregulated, spurring change.In the early 1930s, then-President Franklin Delano Roosevelt pushed for legislation to grant his office the authority to negotiate tariffs. He argued that tariffs had wrecked the economy and that he should have the power to reduce them:World trade has declined with startling rapidity. Measured in terms of the volume of goods in 1933, it has been reduced to approximately 70 percent of its 1929 volume; measured in terms of dollars, it has fallen to 35 percent. The drop in the foreign trade of the United States has been even sharper. Our exports in 1933 were but 52 percent of the 1929 volume, and 32 percent of the 1929 value […] a full and permanent domestic recovery depends in part upon a revived and strengthened international trade and that American exports cannot be permanently increased without a corresponding increase in imports.Thus followed the Reciprocal Trade Agreement Act of 1934 (RTAA), which gave the president the power to set tariff rates, provided it came as part of a reciprocal agreement with a counterpart. This allowed the office to negotiate directly with other nations and promoted a period of liberalized trade. The RTAA, however, is not the law that Trump is now relying on. His tariffs are unilateral, not reciprocal, and would require another century of law to conceive. After the RTAA, Congress continued to delegate authority to the president through the midcentury. Notably, this included the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allowed the president to impose unilateral tariffs in response to national security threats; the Trade Act of 1974, which allowed the president to retaliate against unfair trade practices; and, crucially, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, known as IEEPA. Now, the IEEPA doesn’t say anything about tariffs; it is better known as the law that recent presidents have used to levy sanctions against enemy nations like Russia. It grants the president the power to respond to declared emergencies in response to “unusual and extraordinary threat[s]” (the president also has the power to declare emergencies, but that comes from the National Emergencies Act, a different law) by “investigat[ing], regulat[ing], or prohibit[ing] any transactions in foreign exchange.” Related: Trump’s WLFI crypto investments aren’t paying offDespite this novel application, the Trump administration has seized on the law because, unlike all other tariff statutes, it permits the president to act through executive order alone.Throughout his young second term, Trump has used this statute to declare arbitrary tariffs on virtually all of America’s trading partners. First, declaring 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and then various large tariffs on the rest of the world.To do so, Trump declared a “national emergency posed by the large and persistent trade deficit that is driven by the absence of reciprocity in our trade relationships and other harmful policies like currency manipulation and exorbitant value-added taxes (VAT) perpetuated by other countries.”This was the first time a president had attempted to use the law in this way, and many legal scholars believe it is illegal.Like flies to honeyAlmost immediately after Trump’s tariffs were announced, lawsuits began to trickle in. Fearing retribution from the administration, many trade groups and major players reportedly chose to bow out of proceedings. However, California became the first state to sue on April 16, followed a week later on April 23 by a dozen other states.There are basically two legal arguments you can make against Trump’s tariffs: (1) The IEEPA doesn’t authorize the president to implement his tariff program, and (2) it is unconstitutional for the IEEPA to delegate such broad authority to the president. This is exactly what California and the consortium of 12 states did — arguing that (1) the president’s actions are ultra vires — beyond his legal authority — and (2) they would violate separation of powers. There are a few reasons this might be true. For one, as the states identified, any action under the IEEPA must be tailored to “deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat,” and, “[t]he nearly worldwide 10 percent tariff level is wholly unconnected to the stated basis of the emergency declaration: it applies without regard to any country’s trade practices or purported threat to domestic industries.”Second, there is a constitutional limit on Congress’s authority to delegate Article I powers to the president, known as the “nondelegation doctrine.” While in theory this could be robust, it has generally been nerfed by the obsequious Supreme Court’s past. Nonetheless, there remains an “intelligible principle test” that such delegation may only be allowed “if Congress shall lay down by legislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to fix such rates is directed to conform.”Related: If Trump fired Powell, what would happen to crypto?In theory, if Congress had actually given the president plenary authority to fix tariffs according to his whims, it should violate this doctrine. But the Supreme Court has not struck down an executive action on these grounds since Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan in 1935.Despite the constitutional uncertainty, the net of the arguments is broadly perceived as strong. This is why one “prominent conservative lawyer” told ABC News that plaintiffs may win in a fight against Trump:There is a strong argument that the tariffs imposed under the IEEPA are not legal or constitutional. Under that particular statute, tariffs are not listed amongst the various actions a president can take in response to the declaration of a national emergency.But there are some factors in the president’s favor. For one, the administration may be able to hear these claims in the US Court of International Trade (CIT), which has exclusive jurisdiction over most tariff disputes.Appeals from this court are heard in the Federal Circuit, which is generally seen as favorable for Trump. The 12-state complaint was actually filed in this court from the outset, but California filed its complaint in the Northern District of California, which sits in the less deferential Ninth Circuit.If Trump succeeds in removing that action to CIT, it will be an early victory for the administration.More importantly, the administration is attempting to invoke the “political question doctrine.” In the first major Supreme Court case, 1803’s Marbury v. Madison, the Court noted that “[q]uestions, in their nature political or which are, by the Constitution and laws, submitted to the Executive, can never be made in this court.” Ever since then, pusillanimous courts have used the doctrine to avoid difficult questions, most notably in cases involving impeachment, foreign policy and partisan gerrymandering.The Trump administration argued exactly this in its April 29 motion for preliminary injunction and summary judgment in the states’ AG case. Trump argues that “courts have consistently held that the President’s emergency declarations under NEA, and the adequacy of his policy choices addressing those emergencies under IEEPA, are unreviewable” and that “[t]herefore, any challenge to the fact of the emergency itself — particularly the claim that the emergency is not ‘unusual’ or ‘extraordinary’ enough, in plaintiffs’ view — is a nonjusticiable political question that this Court lacks jurisdiction to consider.”To date, no rulings hint at which side the courts are likely to prefer. The president’s track record in court has historically been poor, with a win rate of 35% in the Supreme Court during his first term, compared to an average presidential win rate of 65.2%.The outlook for cryptoAs the tariff fight has matured, the outlook for crypto is uncertain. It is a peculiarity of tariffs that they apply only to goods and not services or digital products. This has left cryptocurrency assets — intangible, borderless and often routed through offshore entities — outside the reach of traditional trade barriers.As markets shuddered at Trump’s policies, Bitcoin (BTC) finished April up 14% on the month. If Trump is allowed to pursue an arbitrary trade policy and abide by Peter Navarro’s wish to turn the United States into a new hermit nation, it may prove the final validation to force cryptocurrency as the medium of international trade. Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/are-donald-trumps-tariffs-legal-house-of-cards?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3FREFRESH1635508618602&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

2025-05-02T10:45:00.000Z,"Circle’s Refund Protocol, explained: Bringing refunds to stablecoin payments","Why are refunds important in stablecoin payments?              Anyone who has used traditional payment systems will likely be familiar with refunds and chargebacks. If a purchase goes wrong, like receiving damaged items or not receiving the product at all, the payer can file a complaint with the seller to recover their funds. This process of refunds builds trust between payers and sellers, ensuring secure transactions for both sides.However, stablecoin transactions differ significantly. Unlike credit cards or PayPal, stablecoin payments are generally irreversible. Once sent, the payment is final, with no standard way to dispute or reverse it if issues arise, which can make payers wary of using stablecoins for daily purchases.This highlights the importance of refunds in the stablecoin ecosystem. Just as payers rely on protections with traditional payment methods, stablecoin transactions need comparable systems to inspire confidence. Without options to dispute or reverse payments, payers may avoid stablecoins for online shopping or other transactions. A clear, reliable refund system could make stablecoin payments safer and more attractive for payers, whether purchasing digital goods, services or physical items.                  Circle’s Refund Protocol, explained              Circle’s refund protocol is basically a smart contract designed to resolve payment disputes while preventing custodial control over funds. It has transformed the role of arbiter by restricting their ability to redirect funds at will or indefinitely block access.Traditionally, an arbiter could fully control escrowed funds, including misusing or losing them. The Refund Protocol changes this by limiting the arbiter’s powers strictly to dispute resolution. Rather than making the arbiter all-powerful, the protocol entrusts the arbiter with three specific authorities:Set a lockup period during which the payer’s funds are securely held in escrowAuthorize refunds to a pre-specified address provided by the payerAllow early fund withdrawal by the payer if they pay a mutually agreed fee to the arbiter.The arbiter cannot send the funds to any arbitrary address, ensuring they remain non-custodial. The use of a smart contract ensures transparency, locking the process into code rather than trusting human discretion. The smart contract logs the recipient’s address, amount and refund address. By removing full custodial rights and fixing the dispute period, the Refund Protocol protects both payers and recipients while offering a structured, tamper-proof way to handle disagreements.                  Key features of Circle’s Refund Protocol              In digital payments, stablecoins like USDC (USDC) have transformed transactions by providing swift, borderless and stable payment options. But these stablecoins lack the ability to manage disputes or process refunds, which is typically expected from traditional payment systems such as credit cards. The Refund Protocol fills this void.Here are the key features of the Refund Protocol:Non-custodial escrow: With the Refund Protocol, funds are never controlled by a central party. You don’t need to trust any single entity with your funds. Instead, the smart contract itself ensures that funds are only released when the conditions are met. This creates a more secure and trustworthy system for both payers and sellers.Mediation by an arbiter: If a dispute arises, the Refund Protocol employs an arbiter who works as a neutral mediator to settle conflicts without centralization or excessive authority. The arbiter’s role is to facilitate dispute resolution, not to manage the funds. If the payer and the seller cannot resolve the issue, the arbiter can make a final ruling, but they cannot arbitrarily access or control the funds. Lockup periods: To allow both parties time to address issues, the Refund Protocol incorporates lockup periods. During this period, funds stay in escrow, giving both sides an opportunity for negotiation or dispute resolution before funds are transferred to the payer. This ensures the payment isn’t immediately lost to fraud or mistakes.Early withdrawals: If the seller needs access to funds before the lockup period concludes, the Refund Protocol permits early withdrawals. But this is subject to a fee and requires consent from both the payer and the arbiter. Early withdrawals offer flexibility, enabling quicker access to funds if both parties agree on the conditions.Composability and transparency: A standout feature of the Refund Protocol is its composability, designed to integrate effortlessly with other blockchain-based applications. All transactions are logged on the blockchain, allowing the payer to monitor their funds’ status and maintain a clear record if a dispute occurs.Did you know? The Refund Protocol is built to work with USDC and can be integrated into merchant platforms, wallets or payment services. This opens doors to mainstream e-commerce use cases, where stablecoin refunds become as seamless as traditional card chargebacks.                  How Circle’s Refund Protocol works              With Circle’s Refund Protocol, the payer no longer needs to avoid USDC payments, fearing an irreversible payment. It offers a transparent, decentralized and clear method to resolve disputes, ensuring funds’ safety. Here is how the refund protocol works:The payment: When the payer makes a payment, funds aren’t instantly transferred to the seller. The protocol’s smart contract holds the funds in escrow, showing the payment as initiated but pausing the transfer until conditions are fulfilled.The refund: If an issue occurs post-payment, such as non-delivery of service or products, the payer can request a refund from escrow if the supplier agrees. But if the seller doesn’t consent, they can escalate the matter to the arbiter for a resolution.The withdrawal: After the lockup period, if no disputes arise, the seller can withdraw funds without arbiter involvement. The decentralized, non-custodial system would only hold funds when needed.Early withdrawal: If the seller needs funds sooner, they can request early withdrawal. This feature includes a fee the arbiter determines and must be mutually agreed upon with the payer. To prevent arbitrary charges, the recipient must sign off on the terms before the withdrawal can happen.Did you know? The protocol predefines refund addresses at the time of payment. This means that even if disputes arise, arbiters can’t redirect funds elsewhere. It’s a privacy-preserving and fraud-resistant design that limits trust assumptions while still allowing dispute mediation.                  Benefits of the Refund Protocol              Refund Protocol transforms stablecoin transactions by prioritizing security, transparency and user autonomy. It delivers a cost-effective, decentralized framework that enhances trust and usability for everyday payments.Here are some benefits of the Refund Protocol:Non-custodial system: The Refund Protocol ensures funds remain free from centralized control and, subsequently, arbitrary decision-making. This mechanism boosts trust as the payers don’t need to rely on any single entity. The smart contract ensures automated release of funds when conditions are met, fostering a secure, trustworthy environment for both payers and sellers.Transparent dispute resolution: A key advantage of the Refund Protocol is a transparent dispute resolution process. If an issue arises, an arbiter resolves it. As all transactions are onchain, both payers and buyers can monitor dispute progress anytime. Flexibility and control: The payer can designate a refund address in advance, setting payment terms. A seller may withdraw funds early, though with a fee. These features provide greater control over fund handling, which becomes especially useful for uses like e-commerce.Lower costs: By eliminating intermediaries like banks or payment processors, the Refund Protocol cuts transaction fees. This makes stablecoin payments a cost-effective option, particularly for cross-border transfers where traditional methods are slow and expensive.Greater stablecoin adoption: The Refund Protocol has overcome a significant hurdle to stablecoin use — the lack of trust. Its transparent, fair dispute resolution encourages more businesses and consumers to adopt stablecoins.Did you know? Circle’s Refund Protocol helps bridge the trust gap in crypto commerce by mimicking familiar Web2 refund experiences but in a decentralized way. It demonstrates how programmable money can unlock new consumer protection forms without sacrificing blockchain’s permissionless ethos.                  Challenges concerning the Refund Protocol              The Refund Protocol faces hurdles in achieving widespread adoption and seamless functionality. Addressing these challenges is crucial for its scalability and integration into global payment systems.Here are the challenges the Refund Protocol is facing:Adoption by wallet providers: For the Refund Protocol to work smoothly, wallet providers must integrate it with the wallet. If a wallet doesn’t support specifying refund addresses or interacting with the Refund Protocol smart contract, both the payers and the sellers may not be able to use the full range of features. Gas costs and scalability: The Refund Protocol requires multiple interactions with the blockchain — payment deposits, withdrawals and dispute resolutions — each of which can incur gas costs. As the number of transactions grows, the fee may become prohibitive, particularly in high-volume applications. Legal and regulatory considerations: As stablecoins become more widely adopted, there may be legal and regulatory challenges regarding the enforceability of the protocol. The role of the arbiter in dispute resolution may need clarification under various jurisdictions, which could impact the global use of the protocol.Malicious arbiters: While the Refund Protocol minimizes the power of the arbiter, there is still the probability of misuse. A malicious arbiter could approve a refund that isn’t justified, leading to unfair outcomes. To mitigate this risk, auditing mechanisms and reputation systems could help ensure that arbiters act fairly and responsibly.Integration with traditional payment systems: As stablecoins gain popularity, there will likely be challenges in integrating them with traditional fiat-based systems. Most consumers are still accustomed to using credit cards or other payment methods, so ensuring that the Refund Protocol works seamlessly with both stablecoins and fiat currencies is a key challenge for the future.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/circles-refund-protocol-explained-bringing-refunds-to-stablecoin-payments?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

For Glassnode, the key price area to watch for changes in their behavior is the $100,000 zone.“Historically speaking, the Long-Term Holder cohort typically ramps up their spending pressure when the average member is holding a +350% unrealized profit margin,” it explains.“Reconciling this information with the spot price, the average LTH is expected to hit a 350% profit margin at the $99.9k level. As such, we can anticipate an uptick in sell-side pressure as the market approaches this zone, making it an area that will likely require substantial buy-side demand to absorb the distribution, and sustain upwards momentum.”Bitcoin LTH profit levels (screenshot).

This highlights a noteworthy degree of strength behind this upwards swing,” it commented. “However, these are levels that must be broken and held for further price appreciation, as a rejection of this level would push the price back into bearish territory, and return many investors to a state of meaningful unrealized loss.”BTC/USD chart with 11-day SMA, STH realized price.

2025-05-02T09:04:19.000Z,"From digital identity to outer space: Projects push crypto use cases","As the crypto space developed, blockchain use cases expanded from simple digital currencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to more complex areas such as digital identity verification and telecommunications. Ahead of the Token2049 event in Dubai, Cointelegraph spoke with Spacecoin CEO Stuart Gardner, Spacecoin founder Tae Oh, and Humanity Protocol founder Terrence Kwok to explore how they use blockchain to improve certain industries. From addressing challenges like verification in the artificial intelligence era to bringing internet connectivity to developing countries, projects are integrating blockchain to solve problems in different industries.  Digital identity verification to combat the AI threat As artificial intelligence developed, the technology brought improvements that people could benefit from. However, the technology was also adopted by malicious actors who used the tech to perform AI-assisted hack research and deepfake scams.  Kwok told Cointelegraph that just two years ago, the idea of having to prove you’re human seemed “crazy.” However, with today’s advancements in AI, it has become remarkably easy to fake being a real person.“As for content, you can't tell if it's AI-generated or not. Video deepfakes, you cannot tell, right? Even documents. It's super easy now to use AI to create a fake proof of address, a fake proof of balance for your bank statement. I think in the future it's only going to get worse,” he said. The executive also said that in the future, AI may also exist in the physical world through humanoids that might mimic human beings. In 2024, Tesla's humanoid robot project was showcased on social media, highlighting developments in humanoid robotics. Kwok said that the development of robots underscores the need for human identity verification even more. The executive said that this was why they launched the Humanity Protocol, which uses blockchain tech for digital identity verification. “The internet is filled with bots, you know, it's filled with AI agents. They're great, but there's also a need to be able to verify and check whether something or somebody is a person or not,” Kwok told Cointelegraph. Terrence Kwok (left) and Cointelegraph’s Ezra Reguerra at the Dubai Polo and Equestrian Club. Source: CointelegraphRelated: Global demand grows for non-dollar stablecoins, says Fireblocks execDecentralized satellite network to combat the connectivity oligopolyApart from digital identity, blockchain technology is also being used to create a decentralized satellite network. Gardner told Cointelegraph that at the moment, the satellite connectivity landscape is an oligopoly, a market structure where the industry is dominated by only a few large players. The executive pointed out that Starlink and Amazon lead the race, while the EU and China are catching up. However, the big problem is that over 150 countries are lagging behind. “They're going to become reliant upon working with one of these oligopolies for their connectivity. And that poses a big issue for these people,” Gardner added. On Nov. 1, Spacecoin unveiled a plan to launch a decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) through a fleet of nanosatellites in space. Oh told Cointelegraph that the Spacecoin idea came from the observation that the space industry is getting heavily commoditized. However, the executive said that it was possible for smaller companies or even individuals to launch their own satellites and start building constellations for connectivity. The Spacecoin founder added that since different people or entities own each satellite, it's essentially a \""decentralized network.\"" The executive said that they integrated crypto into the project to have a \""trustless means of payment and data exchange.\"" Oh said that this was where the blockchain comes in. Gardner (left), Oh (middle), and Reguerra at the Crypto Polo event in Dubai.

2025-05-02T09:00:00.000Z,"Stablecoins: Depegging, fraudsters and decentralization","Opinion by: Merav Ozair, PhDLately, stablecoins are everywhere — this time around, headed by “traditional” financial institutions. Bank of America and Standard Chartered are considering launching their own stablecoin, joining JPMorgan, which launched its stablecoin, JPM Coin — rebranded as Kinexys Digital Payments — to facilitate transactions with their institutional clients on their blockchain platform, Kinexys (formerly Onyx). Mastercard plans to bring stablecoins to the mainstream, joining Bleap Finance, a crypto startup. The aim is to enable stablecoins to be spent directly onchain — without conversions or intermediaries — seamlessly integrating blockchain assets with Mastercard’s global payment rails. In early April 2025, Visa joined the Global Dollar Network (USDG) stablecoin consortium. The company will become the first traditional finance player to join the consortium. In late March 2025, NYSE parent Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) announced that it is investigating applications for using USDC (USDC) stablecoin and US Yield Coin within its derivatives exchanges, clearinghouses, data services and other markets.Why the renewed interest in stablecoins?Regulatory clarity and acceptanceRecent moves by regulatory bodies in the United States and Europe have created more straightforward guidelines for cryptocurrency use. In the US, Congress is considering legislation to establish formal standards for stablecoins, bolstering confidence among banks and fintech companies.The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation requires that stablecoin issuers operating within the EU adhere to specific financial standards, including special reserve requirements and risk mitigation. In the UK, financial authorities plan to conduct consultations to draft rules governing stablecoin use, further facilitating their acceptance and adoption.The Trump administration executive order 14067, “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology,” supports and “promotes the development and growth of lawful and legitimate dollar-backed stablecoins worldwide” while “prohibiting the establishment, issuance, circulation, and use of a CBDC within the jurisdiction of the United States.”This executive order, followed by Trump’s World Liberty Financial company launching a stablecoin called USD1, signals that this is the era of stablecoins, particularly those pegged to the USD.Do we need more stablecoins?The stablecoin landscapeThere are over 200 stablecoins, most pegged to the US dollar. Two established stablecoins dominate the stablecoin landscape. Tether’s USDt (USDT), the oldest stablecoin, launched in 2014 and USDC, launched in 2018, capturing 65% and 28% of stablecoins market cap, respectively — both are centralized fiat collateralized. Recent: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fightIn third place, a relatively new one, USDe, launched in February 2024, holds about 2% of the stablecoin market cap and has an unconventional mechanism based on derivatives in the crypto market. Although it runs on a DeFi protocol on Ethereum, it incorporates centralized features since centralized exchanges hold the derivatives positions.There are three primary mechanisms of stablecoins:Centralized, fiat-collateralized: A centralized company maintains reserves of the assets in a bank or trust (e.g., for currency) or a vault (e.g., for gold) and issues tokens (i.e., stablecoins) that represent a claim on the underlying asset.Decentralized, cryptocurrency-collateralized: A stablecoin is backed by other decentralized crypto assets. One example can be found in the MakerDAO stablecoin Dai (DAI), which is pegged to the US dollar and encapsulates the features of decentralization. While a central organization controls centralized stablecoins, no one entity controls the issuance of DAI.Decentralized, uncollateralized: This mechanism ensures the stability of the coin’s value by controlling its supply through an algorithm executed by a smart contract. In some ways, this is no different from central banks, which also don’t rely on reserve assets to keep the value of their currency stable. The difference is that central banks, like the Federal Reserve, set a monetary policy publicly based on well-understood parameters, and its status as the issuer of legal tender provides the credibility of that policy.Depegging, risk and fraudstersStablecoins are supposed to be stable. They were created to overcome the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies. To maintain their stability, stablecoins should (1) be pegged to a stable asset and (2) follow a mechanism that sustains the peg.If stablecoins are pegged to gold or electricity, they will reflect the volatility of these assets and thus may not be the best choice if you are seeking a no-risk (or close to no-risk) asset.USDe maintains a peg to the USD through delta hedging. It uses short and long positions in futures, which generates a 27% yield annually — significantly higher than the 12% annual yield of other stablecoins pegged to the USD. Derivative positions are considered risky — the higher the risk, the higher the return. Therefore, it encapsulates an inherited risk due to its reliance on derivatives, which runs counter to the purpose of stablecoins. Stablecoins have been around for more than a decade. During this time, there were no major depegging fiascos other than the case of Terra. The collapse of Terra was not the result of a reserve problem or mechanism but rather the act of fraudsters and manipulators.TerraUSD (UST) had a built-in arbitrage mechanism between UST and the Terra blockchain native coin, LUNA. To create UST, you needed to burn LUNA.To entice traders to burn LUNA and create UST, the creators of the Terra blockchain offered a 19.5% yield on staking, which is crypto terminology for earning 19.5% interest on a deposit, through what they called the Anchor protocol.Such a high interest rate is simply not sustainable. Someone has to borrow at such a rate or above for the lender to receive 19.5% interest. This is how banks make their profit — they charge high interest on borrowing (such as mortgages or loans) and provide low interest on savings (such as a traditional savings account or a certificate of deposit account). Analysis of the Anchor protocol in January 2022 showed it was at a loss.One of the allegations in the lawsuits against Terraform Labs’ founders is that the Anchor protocol was a Ponzi scheme.In March 2025, Galaxy Digital reached a $200-million settlement with the New York Attorney General over claims the crypto investing company promoted the LUNA digital asset without disclosing its interest in the token.In January 2025, Do Kwon, founder of Terra, was found liable for securities fraud and is facing multiple charges in the US, including fraud, wire fraud and commodities fraud. If regulators are interested in preventing future cases like Terra, they should focus on how to deter fraudsters and manipulators from issuing or engaging with stablecoins.Decentralization: Rekindling the premise of BitcoinMost stablecoins are centralized assets collateralized. They are controlled by a company that could conduct unauthorized use of customers’ funds or falsely claim that reserves fully back a stablecoin.To prevent companies’ misconduct, regulators should closely monitor these companies and set rules similar to securities laws. Centralized stablecoins run counter to the notion of blockchain and the premise of Bitcoin. When Bitcoin was launched, it was supposed to be a payment platform free of intermediaries, not controlled by any company, bank or government — a decentralized mechanism — run by the people for the people.If a stablecoin is centralized, it should follow the regulations of any other centralized asset.Maybe it’s time to rekindle the premise of Bitcoin but in a more “stable” fashion. Developing an algorithmic, decentralized stablecoin that is free of any control of a company, bank or government and reviving the core notion of blockchain.Opinion by: Merav Ozair, PhD.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-02T07:33:00.000Z,"Artificial general intelligence (AGI): Can it really think like a human?","What is AGI?              When the lines blur between man and machine, you’re looking at artificial general intelligence (AGI). Unlike its counterpart, artificial narrow intelligence (ANI), which is the use of AI for solving individual problem statements, AGI represents artificial intelligence that can understand, learn and apply knowledge in a way that is indistinguishable from human cognition.AGI is still theoretical, but the prospect of artificial intelligence being able to holistically replace human input and judgment has naturally attracted plenty of interest, with researchers, technologists and academics alike seeking to bring the concept of AGI to reality. Yet another strand of prevailing research seeks to explore the feasibility and implications of AGI vs. ANI in a world increasingly shaped by AI capabilities. Indeed, while ANI has already transformed various industries, AGI’s potential goes far beyond. Imagine a world where machines can not only assist humans in their tasks but also proactively understand the drivers behind specific tasks, predict outcomes, and autonomously create innovative solutions to achieve optimal results. This paradigm shift could revolutionize healthcare, education, transportation and countless other fields.                  Why is AGI so powerful?              Unlike ANI, AGI is not confined to pre-programmed tasks or predefined responses within a limited domain. Instead, it has the potential to generate and apply knowledge across various contexts.Imagine a self-driving car powered by AGI. It can collect a passenger from a train station but also personalize the journey with custom recommendations for pit stops, sightseeing avenues or navigating unfamiliar roads to arrive at the desired destination. And because it’s a machine, AGI would not experience fatigue and would continue learning and improving at exponential speeds. Here’s a definition of AGI by Vitalik Buterin, who highlights the sheer potential of AGI:The example highlights some interesting features of AGI, which include:Learning capability: AGI can learn from experiences and improve its performance over time without a concerted effort by human programmers to perform additional data set training. This learning is not limited to specific tasks and instead encompasses a broad spectrum of activities.Problem-solving skills: AGI can solve complex problems by applying logical reasoning just as a human would. This includes consideration of non-traditional variables, such as emotional impact, which can highlight an even wider range of potential outcomes.Adaptability: AGI can adjust to new situations and environments without explicit programming, which means it can thrive in dynamic and unpredictable settings.Understanding and interpretation: AGI is equipped to comprehend natural language, abstract concepts and emotional nuance, allowing for sophisticated human-machine interactions.Did you know? Blockchain timestamps could serve as a legal memory for AGI systems, allowing future audits to determine exactly what an AGI knew — and when.                  The pursuit of AGI: Where does it stand as of April 2025?              AGI is currently the science-fiction version of AI. However, while still theoretical, the sheer potential of the concept makes AGI the science fiction equivalent of artificial intelligence. While existing models, such as ChatGPT, are constantly evolving and improving with each day, the journey to bringing AGI to life involves overcoming significant technical challenges, such as:Defining the tech stack: The purely hypothetical nature of AGI makes it exceedingly difficult, if not altogether impossible, to determine the precise nature of the technological stack required for practical implementation.Neural networks: Advances in deep learning have propelled this field forward, but AGI would also require specialist neural networks that mimic the human brain’s structure to process information and introduce a layer of emotion and nuance.Natural language processing (NLP): Significant advances are required in the field of NLP to enable machines to better understand and generate human language, incorporating nuance, emotion and complexities. This includes a more complex analysis of language syntax, semantics and context, which is still evolving in traditional machine learning models that leverage NLP. Reinforcement learning: Using reward-based mechanisms to teach machines to make decisions would allow AGI to learn optimal behaviors through trial and error.Despite advancements, creating AGI that can truly think like a human remains an elusive goal.Did you know? DeepMind warns that not all AI risks come from the machines themselves — some start with humans misusing them. In its paper titled ‘An Approach to Technical AGI Safety and Security’, DeepMind identifies four key threats: misuse (bad actors using AI for harm), misalignment (AI knowingly going against its developer’s intent), mistakes (AI causes harm without realizing it), and structural risks (failures that emerge from complex interactions between people, organizations, or systems).                  Can AGI think like a human?              The question of whether AGI can think like a human delves into the very core of human cognition. Human thinking is characterized by consciousness, emotional depth, creativity and subjectivity. While AGI can simulate certain aspects of human thought, replicating the full spectrum of human cognition is a formidable challenge.Several dimensions of human cognition are particularly difficult to emulate:Consciousness and self-awareness: One of the defining traits of human thinking is consciousness, the awareness of oneself and one’s surroundings. AGI, as sophisticated as it may become, lacks the intrinsic human ability to introspect. AGI operates on an underlying set of algorithms and complex, learned patterns, without any subjectivity or genuine emotion.Emotional intelligence: Humans experience a wide range of emotions that influence their decisions, behaviors and interactions. While AGI can be trained to recognize and respond to such emotions, the lack of genuine emotional experience means that it cannot wholly replicate these emotions. Emotional intelligence in humans involves empathy, compassion and moral considerations, elements that are challenging to encode into machines.Creativity and innovation: Creativity involves generating novel ideas and solutions, often through intuitive leaps and imaginative thinking. AGI can mimic creativity by combining existing knowledge in new ways, but it lacks the intrinsic motivation and subjective insight that drive human innovation. True creativity stems from emotional experiences, personal reflections and cultural contexts, which AGI cannot authentically replicate.                  Key benefits of AGI              The litmus test for AGI lies in its ability to holistically replicate a human experience. When realized, the potential benefits are enormous and stretch across various industries, spawning various aspects of daily life.Despite its limitations, AGI is increasingly viewed as a force for good across a range of industries, including:Healthcare: AGI can assist in diagnosing diseases, developing personalized treatment plans and predicting customized health outcomes, leveraging a vast body of underlying training data.Education: It can provide customized learning experiences, tutoring and academic research support. AGI can adapt to individual learning styles and pace, enhancing educational outcomes.Economics: It can optimize financial models, predict market trends, and enhance productivity. It can analyze economic data to forecast market trends and guide investment decisions.Environmental Science: AGI can analyze climate data, model ecological impacts, and propose sustainable solutions.Additionally, AGI’s potential extends to areas such as transportation, communication and entertainment, offering new frontiers for innovation.Did you know? Some futurists believe AGI systems could eventually negotiate with each other autonomously using blockchain-based smart contracts — forming agreements, trading data or even co-developing solutions without human intervention.                  Ethical and societal considerations              The rise of AGI raises significant ethical and societal questions. While powerful, AGI requires careful consideration for safe usage, which has prompted the creation of nonprofit societies, such as the AGI Society, as shown in the image below.Fundamentally, it is crucial to address concerns such as:Safety: Ensuring AGI operates within safe and controlled parameters to prevent unintended consequences. This includes robust testing and the introduction of regulatory frameworks to oversee AGI deployment.Privacy: Protecting personal data from misuse by AGI systems. As AGI can process vast amounts of data, safeguarding privacy is paramount.Bias and fairness: Preventing discriminatory practices and ensuring equitable access to AGI benefits. Developers must ensure that AGI systems are free from biases that could lead to unfair treatment.Employment: Addressing the impact of AGI on job displacement and workforce dynamics. As AGI automates tasks, there is a need to consider its impact on employment and provide support for affected workers.The integration of AGI into society requires a thoughtful approach to its governance, ensuring that it serves the common good and respects social values.                  Can blockchain power AGI?              AGI could create computers as smart as humans, revolutionizing fields like cryptocurrency trading or market analysis. But AGI needs trust and fairness to work for everyone. Blockchain, the tech behind Bitcoin and Ethereum, offers a secure, transparent way to make this happen. Here’s how blockchain can supercharge AGI with crypto-inspired solutions:Clear training records: Blockchain works like Bitcoin’s open transaction log, recording every piece of data (e.g., crypto trading patterns) used to train AGI. This helps ensure the system is fair and free from hidden biases.Shared decision-making: Similar to Ethereum’s smart contracts, blockchain will allow developers, traders and users to vote on AGI’s rules, ensuring no single company controls it.Safe data sharing: Like crypto wallets safeguarding funds, blockchain could protect sensitive data from crypto exchanges, allowing secure sharing for AGI training without leaks.Rewards for fairness: Developers who build unbiased AGI, such as accurate trading predictors, could earn digital tokens, just like crypto mining rewards, encouraging ethical work.However, ongoing challenges such as blockchain’s slow speed, delays in crypto transactions and limited storage capacity could make it hard for AGI to process data quickly or handle large datasets.To make blockchain AGI-ready, researchers are already exploring:Offchain storage: Decentralized systems like InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) are used to store large files offchain, while the blockchain keeps only verifiable hashes, reducing congestion.Sharding and danksharding: Like Ethereum’s scalability upgrades, sharding splits data across multiple nodes, allowing AGI to process more information without slowing down the network. Also, danksharding, an advanced form of sharding being developed for Ethereum, combines rollups and data availability sampling to scale data access efficiently — ideal for real-time AGI applications.Data pruning: Advanced blockchain models like Decentralized Artificial Intelligent Blockchain-based Computing Network (DAIBCN) prune old or irrelevant data, keeping the system lean and optimized for high-demand tasks like AGI. DAIBCN also enables secure, distributed AI computing — blending blockchain trust with AI performance.                  The future of AGI              Artificial general intelligence represents the pinnacle of AI development, promising capabilities that rival human intellect. While AGI can simulate aspects of human thinking, achieving true human-like cognition remains a distant goal. Consciousness, emotional depth and creativity are intrinsic to human experience and pose significant challenges for AGI. Nevertheless, the pursuit of AGI continues to drive innovation and reshape our understanding of intelligence. As we advance toward this frontier, it is imperative to navigate ethical considerations and societal impacts to responsibly harness AGI’s potential.Ongoing research, identifying practical opportunities and technical requirements, and initiating dialogue across society are all essential steps to address the challenges and opportunities posed by AGI. The future of AGI holds promise, but it requires a balanced approach to ensure that its eventual integration into society enhances human well-being and respects ethical standards.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/artificial-general-intelligence-agi-can-it-really-think-like-a-human?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound
