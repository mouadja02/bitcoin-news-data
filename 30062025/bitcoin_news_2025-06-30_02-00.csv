2025-06-29T23:30:00,"Over Half of South Koreans Have Crypto Trading Experience – Survey","More than half of South Koreans aged 20 to 59 have crypto trading experience, with one in four currently HODLing coins. The same survey found that current crypto owners say that tokens like Bitcoin (BTC) make up at least 14% of the total value of their financial assets. South Koreans: Crypto Trading on the Rise? The newspaper Cheonji Ilbo reported that the survey of 1,000 people nationwide was conducted in April this year by the Hana Financial Group’s Research Institute. South Korea called for a “mutually beneficial” agreement on trade with the US during its new trade minister’s first trip to Washington this week. https://t.co/qeMmYlICCy — Bloomberg (@business) June 28, 2025 The survey’s authors explained that 51% of the people they spoke to “had experience investing in crypto,” with 27% currently HODLing their coins. In this latter group, investors said they were holding onto an average of around 13 million won ($9,547) worth of coins. In the early stages of investment, the researchers found, traders tended to focus on Bitcoin. However, they also found that as traders gained experience, they tended to buy more altcoins, with a focus on stablecoins . Wallets on Multiple Exchanges The data also appears to indicate that many South Korean traders are prepared to shop around to find better prices. Over half of the respondents said they held crypto wallets on multiple domestic crypto exchanges . Seven out of 10 said they have traded on the market-leading trading platform Upbit. Trading volumes on the Upbit crypto exchange over the past three months. (Source: CoinGecko) The majority of crypto-trading survey participants (60%) said they began investing in crypto in earnest during the 2020 Bitcoin bull run. Three-quarters of investors began investing with stakes worth less than 3 million won ($2,203). However, the value of their collective investments appears to have risen considerably. Over four in 10 of the crypto investors said they currently have coins worth more than 10 million won ($7,344) in their wallets. Majority of Traders Are Male Office Workers, Data Shows Most crypto investors were aged 40-49, with 67% of male respondents and just 33% of women saying they had bought coins. The majority of crypto investors (over half) said they were in white collar office jobs, with just 12% of physical laborers saying they had crypto holdings. The data also indicated that crypto investing-South Koreans tend to take more risks in the financial markets. The researchers noted that 38% of respondents showed signs of taking an “active” or “aggressive” approach to investment tendency. This, they said, was twice the overall average of 20%. The research institute explained: “Investors who have tried and experienced virtual asset investment even once had a higher aggressive investment tendency than investors who have no experience with crypto.” The top eight coins on the Bithumb platform by trading volumes over the past 24 hours. (Source: CoinGecko) Stablecoin Spike The findings appear to correlate with recent reports of a large spike in USD-pegged stablecoin and kimchi coin trading . Investment in coins like USDT has risen sharply in South Korea this year. And after the June 3 election of President Lee Jae-myung, speculative buying in stablecoin-related tokens has also seen an uptick. Lee has pledged to launch a won-pegged stablecoin and allow domestic firms to create stablecoin-powered payment platforms.

2025-06-29T22:51:40,"Bitcoin Jumps After Trump Says Growth Will Offset Deficits, Boosting Bull Case for BTC and Gold","Bitcoin (BTC) BTC traded at $107,937 as of 22:22 UTC on Sunday, up 0.54% over the past 24 hours, as attention turned to fiscal policy tensions in Washington following President Trump's latest post on Truth Social. Price action remained volatile, with BTC fluctuating between $107,194 and $108,489 during the 24-hour window, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. On June 29, 2025, President Donald Trump posted a pointed message on Truth Social addressing Republican lawmakers amid intense debate over his sweeping tax-and-spending package. “For all cost cutting Republicans, of which I am one, REMEMBER, you still have to get reelected. Don’t go too crazy! We will make it all up, times 10, with GROWTH, more than ever before,” he wrote. This statement underscores the deep divisions within the GOP as it wrestles with the ambitious legislation dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill.” The bill, exceeding 900 pages, combines roughly $3.8 trillion in tax cuts with targeted spending reductions and increased funding for defense and border security. It seeks to make permanent many of the tax breaks from Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including eliminating taxes on tips, overtime pay, and certain auto loans. The child tax credit would rise to $2,200 under the Senate version, while deductions for seniors would increase temporarily. However, to offset these tax cuts, Republicans propose significant cuts to Medicaid and nutrition programs, sparking fierce debate within the party. Moderate Republicans from high-tax states are pushing for a higher cap on state and local tax deductions (SALT), while conservatives demand deeper spending cuts, particularly targeting Medicaid. These internal disagreements complicate efforts to secure the narrow Republican majorities needed in both chambers to pass the bill, which Democrats uniformly oppose as favoring the wealthy and worsening inequality. Trump’s social media message reflects an attempt to balance these competing pressures — urging fiscal restraint to satisfy conservatives while emphasizing that robust economic growth will compensate for revenue losses and help reduce deficits over time. This supply-side economic approach projects that growth will “make it all up” despite near-term increases in the national debt, which nonpartisan analysts estimate could add trillions to the existing $36.2 trillion debt. Crypto analyst Will Clemente’s reaction on X (formerly Twitter) shortly after Trump’s post captures a common market sentiment: “How can you read this and hold long term US treasuries at current yields lol... Also, how can you read this and not hold any Bitcoin or gold.” Clemente’s skepticism toward long-term U.S. Treasuries reflects concerns that the bill’s deficit-financed tax cuts and modest spending cuts signal a loose fiscal policy that could fuel inflation and currency debasement. In this context, traditional fixed-income assets like Treasuries may appear less attractive, as rising deficits and potential monetary accommodation threaten bond values. Conversely, hard assets such as gold and Bitcoin are increasingly viewed as stores of value and hedges against inflation and fiscal risk. The expectation of sustained deficits and political challenges to fiscal discipline bolster demand for these inflation-resistant assets. With the Senate racing to finalize the bill before the July 4 holiday, Trump’s call for unity and moderation highlights the high stakes and political challenges in passing one of the most consequential fiscal packages in recent U.S. history. The bill’s fate remains uncertain as lawmakers negotiate to balance tax relief, spending cuts, and political feasibility. Technical Analysis Highlights From June 28 15:00 to June 29 14:00 UTC, BTC traded from $107,194 to $108,489, a 1.21% intraday range. Support was established at $107,300, with multiple rebounds during the 02:00–03:00 window. Volume peaked at 7,538 BTC between 08:00 and 11:00 UTC on June 29, confirming upward momentum. During the final session hour (13:05–14:04 UTC), BTC fell from $108,219 to $108,059, forming a descending channel. A 130 BTC volume spike at 13:35 coincided with a sharp dip to $108,030, which was tested and held. Final intraday rally pushed price back toward $108K before fading slightly by 22:22 UTC to $107,937.

2025-06-29T22:00:47,"Cathie Wood Says New Mortgage Rule May Benefit Crypto","Cathie Wood, leader of Ark Invest, has publicly endorsed a proposal from the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). The housing agency is considering a new rule that could allow people to use Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies when applying for home loans. Bitcoin May Soon Be Used in Mortgage Applications This change could help many crypto holders qualify for mortgages without having to convert their digital money into physical cash. The proposal has caught the attention of top financial leaders, including Strategy’s Chairman, Michael Saylor. She believes this proposal, if approved, could give the digital asset a bigger role in the U.S. financial system. Under the current system, banks typically verify a person’s income, employment status, and credit history before approving a mortgage. This can be a problem for individuals who own a significant amount of cryptocurrency but do not have a steady income or a regular job. This is because banks have not widely accepted digital assets as tangible proof of wealth. The FHFA’s proposal is set to change that. The new rule would allow crypto holders to use their digital assets as part of their loan application. This means they might not need to sell their Bitcoin to prove they can afford a home. Cathie Wood and Michael Saylor Weigh In Cathie Wood supported the idea, saying it could help more people become homeowners and increase the acceptance of crypto in the economy. Michael Saylor, another big supporter of Bitcoin , agreed and said Bitcoin is not just a risky investment. He added that the digital coin is a strong store of value and a powerful tool for resisting authoritarian financial control . In his view, Bitcoin deserves the same recognition as traditional assets, such as cash or stocks. He added that home ownership should not be out of reach for people with Bitcoin holdings. This is especially important for early Bitcoin investors and individuals who earn in cryptocurrency but lack formal income documents. Bitcoin to See Mainstream Use Bill Pulte, the new Director of FHFA, also backed the proposal. In a recent X post , he stated that the housing agency will carefully examine how cryptocurrency can reflect a borrower’s financial strength. This signals a growing effort to bring digital assets into the core of everyday finance. Meanwhile, the United Wholesale Mortgage became the first mortgage company to accept cryptocurrency payments . However, the initiative was halted in 2021 due to ongoing regulatory uncertainty. Fast-forward to 2025, crypto-friendly policies are now gaining momentum across the country. This comes as President Donald Trump has shared his vision to make America the crypto capital of the world. If the FHFA’s proposed rule is implemented, it could also attract more banks and large companies to the crypto space. It would help make Bitcoin more than just an investment; it could become a real tool for building and securing wealth.

2025-06-29T21:13:09,"Bitcoin Mining Companies’ Revenues Are Falling, But They’re Not Selling – What Does This Mean Historically?","Cryptocurrency analytics company Alphractal has published a remarkable assessment of the Bitcoin mining industry. The report notes that miners are not selling their Bitcoin reserves despite facing historically low profitability. Total transaction fees paid on the Bitcoin network have fallen to their lowest levels since 2012. This is attributed to the fact that on-chain activity has been extremely low this cycle, severely reducing miner revenues. Despite the recent decrease in hash rate, there has been no adjustment to the network difficulty yet. This delay further narrows miners’ margins and delays the network from reaching balance. Related News: Tomorrow is a Critical Day for BNB - Here's What to Expect The Bitcoin network is experiencing the highest hash rate fluctuations in its history. This is believed to be due to some major mining operations shutting down their ASIC devices, with falling revenues and decreasing network demand being cited as the reasons. Despite the difficult mining conditions, the fact that miners have not yet sold their reserves is considered a positive sign. According to Alphractal, some mining pools may have scaled back their activities in line with the decline in global chain usage. With Bitcoin trading above $107,000, miners are thought to be reallocating hash power based on current demand. According to the analyst firm, in past cycles, miners typically sold during periods of rapid price appreciation and increased network activity. However, both elements are currently at low levels, suggesting that the market may be in a period of “adjustment” rather than “capitulation.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-29T21:00:14,"Bitcoin Miners Hold On To Their Coins Despite Low Profitability — Details","According to the latest on-chain data, Bitcoin miners refuse to offload their BTC holdings despite profitability being historically low. BTC Transaction Fees At Lowest Level Since 2012 In a new post on X, blockchain analytics firm Alphractal revealed that Bitcoin miners are still holding on to their reserves despite the decline in revenue. The on-chain data platform discussed the reasons behind this trend and its potential implications on the BTC mining industry. Firstly, Alphractal highlighted low on-chain activity in this cycle as one of the reasons behind the significant decline in miner revenues. As a result of the reduced activity, the total transaction fees paid on the Bitcoin network have dropped to their lowest levels since 2012. The market intelligence platform also mentioned that the mining difficulty has remained high even though the hash rate recently witnessed a drop . Typically, there is a direct relationship or positive correlation between the hashrate and mining difficulty. However, according to Alphractal, this recent lag or dissociation further strains miner profitability and delays network equilibrium. Furthermore, Alphractal revealed on X that the Bitcoin hash rate volatility has reached new all-time highs. This basically implies that the network is witnessing the highest hash rate fluctuations or changes in its history. The blockchain analytics firm added: This is likely caused by large mining operations shutting down ASIC machines, possibly due to falling revenues and low network demand. Despite the network revenues and the high mining difficulty, selling pressure from miners has remained at low levels. As exhibited by the low Miner Sell Pressure metric, this indicates that miners are not aggressively offloading their holdings for profit. Alphractal admitted that the low selling pressure from miners is a positive sign, especially for the price of Bitcoin. The blockchain firm noted the possibility of some mining pools scaling down their operations in response to the decreased activity on the Bitcoin network. “As BTC trades above $107K, we may simply be witnessing miners reallocating their hash power to adapt to the current demand,” Alphractal added. Typically, BTC miners tend to sell their coins for profit during periods of rapid price increases and high blockchain activity. However, Alphractal believes the current absence of both suggests a period of adjustment rather than capitulation amongst the miners.

2025-06-29T20:48:00,"Crypto Presale of the Decade: Bitcoin Solaris Set to Create More Millionaires Than Original Bitcoin","Back in 2010, a few hundred bucks and a little courage could’ve made you a Bitcoin millionaire. Fast forward to today, and the crypto world is asking one big question, what’s the next Bitcoin moment? Some say it won’t happen again. Others are pointing to a new contender that isn’t trying to replace Bitcoin, but elevate its legacy. That project is Bitcoin Solaris, and its explosive presale is already turning early believers into future legends. Bitcoin Was the Spark, But Now It’s About the Flame Let’s be honest, Bitcoin’s price might keep rising, but it’s no longer the coin that makes millionaires overnight. The original crypto asset has matured into a store of value, like digital gold. Safe? Sure. Fast returns? Not anymore. That’s why even long-time Bitcoin holders are now eyeing something different. Bitcoin Solaris doesn’t just offer a faster chain or better DeFi. It combines speed, scalability, and mining access into a wealth-generation engine designed for the modern crypto era. And early adopters are paying attention for a reason. What Makes Bitcoin Solaris So Different? Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is not another “altcoin” chasing hype. It’s a next-gen blockchain that fuses Bitcoin’s scarcity with Solana-style throughput, while adding real-world accessibility through mobile mining. Let’s break down what gives BTC-S its edge: 10,000 transactions per second and 2-second finality, made possible by a hybrid architecture A dual-layer blockchain featuring Proof of Work (PoW) for the base layer and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) for the Solaris Layer Advanced validator rotation to keep block production efficient and secure Smart contract support built with cross-chain bridges to expand DeFi use cases Energy-efficient mobile mining through the exciting release of the Solaris Nova app And yes, this is all backed by not one, but two independent audits. The Cyberscope and Freshcoins audits both verified the smart contract integrity of BTC-S, giving presale investors even more peace of mind. Smart Contracts at Lightning Speed See Why Developers Love BTC-S Tokenomics Built for the Long Run The way Bitcoin Solaris handles its token distribution reflects its deep understanding of scarcity, fairness, and community power. Its tokenomics model is as follows: 66.66% allocated to mining, released over 90 years 20% for presale participants 5% to liquidity pools 2% each for community rewards, marketing, staking incentives, and ecosystem development 0.33% reserved for team and advisors This structure ensures the vast majority of BTC-S ends up in the hands of real users, not insiders or whales. The Presale That’s Breaking All Records If you’ve been watching presale trends, you’ll know they usually fizzle fast. Not this one. Bitcoin Solaris is currently in the last day in phase 9 , with a price of $9, set to rise to $10 in the next phase. It’s heading for a $20 launch, promising 150% gains out the gate. With less than 5 weeks remaining, the momentum is getting louder: Over 12,800+ unique buyers More than $5.8 million raised One of the shortest, most viral presales in recent memory Make sure to use Trust Wallet or Metamask to claim your tokens after the presale ends. In addition, Bitcoin Solaris introduced daily mini games for holders for a chance to earn daily free prizes, checkout the full breakdown here. Mobile Mining and Wealth Made Simple The upcoming Solaris Nova app will allow users to earn BTC-S tokens directly from their phones. This isn’t fake mining. The energy-efficient algorithm is real, and results are tracked transparently. You can even simulate your rewards using the official mining calculator . This mobile-first approach removes the barrier to entry, making wealth generation accessible to anyone with a smartphone. And with the mining rewards backed by real chain mechanics, early users can stack coins daily without touching a traditional rig. Influencer Eyes Are on It Too Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just turning heads in chat rooms. It’s being talked about by some of the sharpest names in the space. For example, the Token Galaxy review dives into why this project’s fundamentals and architecture set it apart from the dozens of gimmick tokens launching every month.

2025-06-29T20:32:46,"Bitcoin Miners HODL Through Worst Payout in a Year: CryptoQuant","Bitcoin may be struggling to rally past its all-time high of $112,000, but miners are going through a tougher time. They have recently recorded some of their worst paydays in history. On-chain data, including the Miner Profit/Loss Sustainability metric, analyzed by the market intelligence platform CryptoQuant, revealed that miner revenues have declined significantly. However, this has not triggered any form of panic selling among them. Miner Revenues Plummet According to the report , miners are the most underpaid they have been in a year. On June 22, daily revenues fell to a two-month low of $34 million due to lower transaction fees and the latest plunge in bitcoin’s (BTC) price. CryptoQuant said the figure is the lowest since April 20. While miner revenues remain low, the hashrate of the Bitcoin network has also declined slightly. This metric has plummeted 3.5% since June 16; while CryptoQuant sees this as a small drawdown, it is the largest plunge since July 2024. The Bitcoin network hashrate fell 8.4% in July 2024 as miner revenues dropped following the halving that slashed block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. Regardless of the low revenues, miner outflows have dropped, indicating that selling is still muted. Bitcoin transfers from miners to crypto exchanges have fallen from a daily peak of 23,000 BTC in February to about 6,000 BTC currently. CryptoQuant said miners are not selling as much as they used to because they are still enjoying 48% Net Unrealized Profit/Loss operating margins. Still Room for Growth Notably, miners have not recorded any days of extremely high flows to exchanges since February. In fact, large miners have been replenishing their reserves. CryptoQuant’s analysts found that miner addresses holding between 100 BTC and 1,000 BTC have expanded their collective holdings from 61,000 BTC on March 31 to 65,000 BTC currently. This is their highest level since November 2024, when reserves fell below 71,000 BTC after BTC rallied past $100,000 for the first time. The spike in reserves further solidifies the belief that there is no selling pressure from them at bitcoin’s current price levels. Additionally, miners from the Satoshi era have only sold 150 BTC so far this year, compared to roughly 10,000 BTC last year. This cohort of market participants often sells during strong rallies, indicating market tops. Since they have refrained from selling so far, it implies that BTC still has more room for growth.

According to the petition filed in the Federal Court for the Southern District of New York, the parties believe that extending the deadline will help “avoid unnecessary filing processes.” The prosecutor’s office agrees with the request. Lawyers stated that Kwon was ready, but that the extension would be beneficial due to the “productive discussions” between the parties. It was also reported that the requested postponement would not affect other court dates. Accordingly, the start date of the hearing is still scheduled for February 17, 2026.

During a hearing last week, Judge Paul Engelmayer hinted that the newly passed GENIUS Act could affect the course of the case. The GENIUS (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins) Act, which passed the US Senate on June 17, aims to regulate stablecoins for payment purposes.

2025-06-29T20:00:07,"Crypto Strategist Unveils Bitcoin Path to New All-Time High Next Month, Says Plenty of Liquidity To Trigger Run for Altcoins","A crypto analyst gaining traction for timely Bitcoin calls is outlining a scenario where BTC breaks free from sideways trading and surges to new all-time highs. Pseudonymous analyst Credible tells his 468,700 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin appears to be following an Elliott Wave (EW) pattern where BTC consolidates in the next few weeks before igniting a breakout rally toward the end of July. Elliott Wave theory is an advanced form of technical analysis that seeks to forecast future price movements by tracking crowd psychology, which often unfolds in recurring wave patterns. Says Credible, “BTC holding up very well over the last few days. As stated in my last update, I think we will test the blue zone sooner or later, whether that be before or after taking our local range highs. From an EW perspective, something like this would be ideal. Although there are, of course, a few different structures that we may see to complete this correction, structures that lead to a tighter compression before expansion are always preferred because a substantial decrease in volatility/compression usually leads to a stronger breakout after. Focus should remain on key levels (blue zone and range highs) in terms of areas of interest.” Source: Credible/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that Bitcoin will briefly rally above $110,000 before pulling back to the $100,000 level to gear up for a breakout surge. As for the altcoin market, Credible thinks that alts will witness huge upside bursts despite concerns about liquidity sources. According to the analyst, crypto investors had the same liquidity worry about Bitcoin when it was trading below $30,000, and now BTC is worth $107,417. “Stop worrying about ‘where the liquidity will come from’ for alts.

Bitcoin Price Chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $104,149, beginning a bearish trend to $98,129. Is Bitcoin a good investment?

Recent news/opinions on BTC Following the US, Pakistan announced its first government-backed strategic bitcoin reserve, marking a notable step towards adding crypto assets into its financial strategy. Bitcoin price prediction June 2025 Bitcoin’s Q1 2025 performance was notably weak, with a 12.5% loss, as per CoinGlass data, marking the worst first quarter since 2018. However, it made a strong comeback in Q2 as in the last few weeks of May, the price of Bitcoin made a new ATH at $111,970. Will Bitcoin continue its upward rally in June? Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $105,000 and be pushed further, at least $113,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $97,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction June 2025 $97,000 $105,000 $113,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history | Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K.

2025-06-29T19:05:08,"Latest Report on Cryptocurrency Owners in South Korea Released – Major Changes Are Underway, Here Are the Trends","The “2050 Generation Virtual Asset Investment Trends Report” published by Hana Financial Research Institute revealed that virtual asset investment in South Korea has become a serious financial asset rather than a speculative tool. According to the report, 27% of individuals between the ages of 20 and 50 invest in cryptocurrencies, and these investments constitute an average of 14% of their total financial assets. The research is based on survey results conducted with 1,000 people. The crypto ownership rate is at its highest level, with 31% among individuals in their 40s. 70% of investors state that they plan to increase their crypto investments in the future. Another noteworthy piece of data from the report is that more than half of investors in their 50s are holding crypto for retirement preparation. 78% of this age group stated that they invested in virtual assets for the purpose of creating large savings, and 53% directly for old age preparation. Related News: A Turning Point for Cryptocurrencies: Solana and Ethereum ETFs with Staking Could Soon Begin Trading While 79% of investors use crypto to “grow money,” only 24% say they invest for “fashion and entertainment,” and 22% say they invest for “daily living expenses.” This suggests that crypto is now being viewed as a serious portfolio asset. Behaviors towards crypto investments are also maturing. The proportion of regular investors increased from 10% to 34%, while the proportion of medium-term investors increased from 26% to 47%. The proportion of short-term investors decreased from 48% to 45%. While 90% of investors stated that they only hold coins, interest in new generation digital assets such as NFTs and security tokens remained low. 60% of investors who hold an average of two different coins include Bitcoin in their portfolios. Initially focused on Bitcoin, investment strategies have expanded over time with altcoin and stablecoin diversity. The biggest complaint from investors was the inability to establish a connection between exchanges and existing bank accounts. Under the current system, exchanges can only be assigned a single bank account. 70% of participants said they would prefer their main bank if this restriction was lifted. Market volatility (56%), stock market risk (61%) and fraud concerns (61%) still significantly influence investment decisions. However, investors see the more active role of traditional financial institutions (42%) and increased regulation (35%) as positive steps. *This is not investment advice.

In a new interview on CNBC Television, Yardeni predicts that the US stock market will surge to new all-time highs amid an improving macroeconomic picture. “I think we’re still very much in a bull market… I think the market is going to go higher because I think the economy is going to prove resilient. It has shown some weakness of late, but that’s really old data, data that is in response to all the uncertainties, and I think a lot of the uncertainties have dissipated. Clearly, [the trade war] is not a done issue yet, but I think it will be by the end of the summer.” The market strategist also notes that risk assets like stocks have a history of climbing a “wall of worry,” rallying even as most investors are sidelined amid fear, uncertainty and doubt. “There’s always risk, clearly, in the market, and things to be concerned about. Sometimes the market goes up best when everybody is worried. What’s interesting is here we are basically at a record high, and a lot of the sentiment indicators are still very wary, very cautious. You’re not seeing a lot of bullishness in the sentiment indicators. So that’s a good thing. That suggests that people just really haven’t bought into this recovery from the correction.” On Friday, the S&P 500 closed the trading day at 6,173 points – a new all-time high.

2025-06-29T19:00:16,"Strategy Exec Launches Massive MSTR Selling Spree","Some executives of the American business intelligence and software firm Strategy Inc. have decided to sell their MSTR shares instead. Some filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have shown massive insider trading of the shares within the last three months. Strategy CEO Still Holds a Big MSTR Bag According to the filings, Strategy CEO Phong Le launched an MSTR selling spree during this period, with sales of over $14 million worth of shares recorded. This fund covers 8,400 shares of Class A common stock, sold on June 18 from his holdings. There were other transactions by VP & CAO Montgomery Jeanine, EVP & General Counsel Shao Wei-Ming, EVP & CFO Kang Andrew, Directors Carl Rickertsen and Patten Jarrod. Even after the offload transaction from Phong’s account, the Strategy executive still personally owns 16,390 shares of the same stock. Not only does he own a significant number of Class A common stock, but Phong also holds 6,000 and 4,500 shares of two different series of preferred stock (“Strife” and “Stride”). Selling Pressure? MSTR Remains in the Clear A significant number of MSTR holders have argued that this selling spree is rather a routine practice. Still, it is not surprising that some other crypto enthusiasts are wondering what this insider trading means for MSTR. While there is no specific response to this probe, it is worth noting that the selling spree is not a sure sign of a lack of confidence. For now, the sums are not significant enough to trigger any alarm or signal severe selling pressure. The company had recently purchased an additional 245 Bitcoin units at a cost of around $26 million. Its Bitcoin holdings are now approximately 592,345 BTC. Strategy Faces Class Action Lawsuits Over Bitcoin Meanwhile, Strategy has been sued for making misleading statements about Bitcoin, as well as the company’s business, operations, and prospects. About five law firms filed their identical class action lawsuits against the business intelligence software firm. Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC, a nationally recognized law firm, claimed that “the anticipated profitability of the Company’s bitcoin-focused investment strategy and treasury operations was overstated.” Strategy was further accused of understating the various risks associated with Bitcoin’s volatility, in addition to failing to reveal the magnitude of losses Strategy could incur on the value of its digital assets following its adoption of ASU 2023-08.

According to a new press release by the Department of Justice (DOJ), 39-year-old Oluwaseun Adekoya, who resides in New Jersey, has been convicted of bank fraud conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy and nine counts of aggravated identity theft for masterminding the plot. Authorities say that Adekoya obtained public information regarding people’s home equity lines of credit (HELOC), identified those who had substantial amounts and then used encrypted messaging apps to find out private identifying information about his victims. Adekoya subsequently recruited “a vast web of managers” around the nation, shared the information with them and supplied them with fake identification cards so they could impersonate HELOC customers at banks and credit unions to withdraw funds from victims’ accounts. To avoid detection, Adekoya utilized a network of burner phones and used encrypted chat applications to pass key information. He also laundered funds through bank accounts under other people’s names. According to the press release, Adekoya has an extensive criminal rap sheet and has been convicted of fraud-related crimes numerous times since 2008. Authorities say they had been investigating Adekoya since May 2022. He and 13 others were indicted in December 2023, and all have since pleaded guilty. Federal agents seized Rolex watches, a $51,000 Tiffany engagement ring, designer handbags and shoes, as well as a bank account containing $26,000 from Adekoya. Adekoya’s sentencing is scheduled on October 30th, and he is facing a minimum of two years and a maximum of 32 years behind bars.

2025-06-29T18:00:00,"Top cryptocurrencies to watch this week: Bitcoin, Sui, Sonic","All eyes are on Sui this week as the Layer-1 blockchain prepares for a major token unlock that could reshape its near-term price action. While Bitcoin ( BTC ) flirts with a breakout past $107,000 and ETF inflows near $50 billion, Sui ( SUI ) is drawing heightened scrutiny ahead of its July 1 unlock of 5.22 billion tokens—worth over $154 million, or 1.63% of total supply. This recurring monthly event, scheduled to continue through 2030, has become a significant driver of volatility. Technical indicators point to further downside as SUI trades below its 50-day moving average within a descending channel. With the price hovering near the $2 support level, traders are bracing for movement. Meanwhile, broader market sentiment remains mixed as macro data, including U.S. nonfarm payrolls and trade updates, loom. Sonic ( S ) is also in focus ahead of the latest U.S. nonfarm payroll data, to be released on July 3.

Data shows that Bitcoin ETF inflows jumped by over $2.2 billion last week, its third consecutive week of gains. This growth resulted in cumulative inflows of nearly $50 billion. Technical indicators suggest that the Bitcoin price is eyeing a bullish breakout to its all-time high, which may occur this week. It has formed a bullish flag and a cup-and-handle pattern, which often leads to more gains. The distance between the upper side and the lower side of the cup is about 30%. Measuring the same distance from its upper side brings the target to about $145,000. Such a move will likely trigger a new crypto market bull run .

Sui price at risk as a big unlock nears Meanwhile, Sui, a top layer-2 network, will be in the spotlight as the Sui Foundation unlocks 5.22 billion tokens worth over $154 million, or 1.63% of the total supply. Sui has a maximum supply limit of 10 billion tokens and a circulation of 3.39 billion. It unlocks over 55 million tokens on the first of every month, a trend that will continue until 2030. Technicals show that the SUI price has moved below the 50-day moving average and has formed a descending channel. Therefore, the price may continue falling as traders eye the support at $2 ahead of the unlock event.

Sonic price prepares for a token unlock Sonic, formerly known as Fantom, has been in a downtrend, with its token falling by 705 from its highest point this year. The main catalyst for the Sonic price will be on Thursday, when the network unlocks tokens worth over $73.7 million, representing 7.50% of the total float. Sonic has a circulating supply of 2.88 billion against a total supply of 3.17 billion. S price chart | Source: crypto.news The 12-hour chart shows that the Sonic price has crashed from the year-to-date high of $0.9833 to the current $0.3166. It recently moved below the support at $0.3810, the lowest swing on April 8. It remains below the 50-period moving average. Therefore, the token will likely continue falling as sellers target the support at $0.20.

2025-06-29T17:30:59,"Coinbase (COIN) Shares Outperform S&P 500 Stocks","In the latest publication of The Kobeissi Letter, shares of Coinbase (COIN) recorded a significant spike. Moreover, the publicly-listed stock outperformed the broader market, including the other shares in the S&P 500. This June, COIN rose by 43%, surpassing the other shares to become the top performer in the S&P 500. GENIUS Act Impacts Positively on Coinbase Stock Performance The 43% surge pushed COIN to its highest level ever since its public debut in 2021. The spike is largely attributed to a shift in investor focus towards stablecoin revenue, triggered by Washington’s progress on the GENIUS Act for stablecoin regulation. For instance, Bitcoin (BTC) has recently rallied to over $108,600, gradually inching towards its previously held all-time high (ATH). This outlook is likely fueled by the series of positive institutional news entering the market. One of such is JPMorgan’s trademark application for digital asset services. Purpose Investments is also planning to launch a spot XRP ETF in Canada but is still awaiting regulatory approval from the appropriate authorities. Market Strength Remains Primarily Tied to BTC Even Nansen research analyst Nicolai Søndergaard acknowledged that the market strength is still primarily tied to BTC’s performance. As a result, he does not see the nearing of an ‘alt season’, even with altcoins like Ripple-associated XRP and Chainlink (LINK), registering strong gains. According to CoinMarketCap, BTC price is currently at $108,093.73, following a 0.88% spike in the last 24 hours. Already, Bitfinex analysts have projected that if BTC can hold the $102,000-$103,000 support zone, it could signal that a local bottom has formed. Additionally, Swissblock analysts anticipate significant volatility driven by Fed Chair Powell’s remarks during the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. Ark Invest Offloads COIN Shares Although COIN has recently registered remarkable growth, a few companies may have missed out on it. On June 26, Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest offloaded shares from major fintech firms, including Coinbase. Precisely, the company sold more than $24 million worth of shares from Coinbase Global Inc. and Block Inc. At the time, the US crypto market was displaying signs of strength and growing regulatory clarity, which caused COIN to reach an all-time high (ATH).

2025-06-29T17:28:49,"Trump Backs Bitcoin in Latest White House Speech – Best Crypto to Buy Before the Next Bull Run","In Friday’s White House press conference, Donald Trump yet again declared his support for Bitcoin, calling it ‘amazing’ and pointing out its growing use in the economy. It has become amazing. I mean, it is the jobs that it produces, and I notice more and more you pay in Bitcoin. People are saying it takes a lot of pressure off the dollar, and it is a great thing for our country. – Donald Trump in latest White House speech In this article, we’ll quickly touch upon Trump’s latest pro-crypto comments, how they could spark another altcoin rally, and what the best crypto to buy is if you wish to capitalize on the momentum before the next leg up. Trump Says Bitcoin is Relieving Dollar Strain Easily the most notable piece of Trump’s speech was his claim that Bitcoin is relieving pressure off the US dollar. This is ‘ a much more significant statement than what it seems at first glance ,’ says digital asset researcher Anders. According to Anders, Trump’s comment suggests he understands the ‘Triffin dilemma,’ which is a long-standing economic paradox, and that he’s probably keen on using crypto to solve it. The Triffin dilemma is the term used to describe the conflict faced by the country (in this case, the USA) whose currency (the US dollar) serves as the world’s reserve currency. The ‘dilemma’ is that while the US dollar becomes stronger by boosting its global demand, this very strength then widens the country’s trade deficit. A stronger dollar makes imports cheaper and exports become more expensive. Using a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin – or XRP, which is a more ‘US-made’ crypto than $BTC – could help ease pressure on USD. If investments flow in the form of $BTC rather than $USD, it would reduce demand for the dollar, weakening it and, therefore, correcting the trade deficit. All in all, Trump’s renewed endorsement adds momentum to the crypto narrative. It positions Bitcoin (and potentially other tokens) as a genuinely strategic financial tool. With that in mind, here are a few cryptos that could benefit from Bitcoin’s latest tap on the shoulder. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Crypto to Buy Now, Offering Free $BTC Airdrops BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is one of the best cryptos to invest in right now because, first and foremost, it’s the ONLY one offering free $BTC to its token holders. Buy $BTCBULL and store it in Best Wallet , and whenever Bitcoin crosses $150K and $200K for the first time, you’ll automatically receive your share of free $BTC. Additionally, holding BTC Bull Token will also beef up your crypto portfolio. That’s because the token is predicted to surge 277% and reach $0.0096 by 2026 . One $BTCBULL is currently priced at just $0.00258, and the project has in total raised over $7.6M (and counting) in early investor funding. Another reason for this new crypto’s potential bright future is its token burn mechanism. Simply put, the developers will shave off a part of the total token supply with rising Bitcoin prices. This will create artificial scarcity and upward price pressure, especially during Bitcoin bull runs. It’s a clever way of aligning the token’s growth with Bitcoin’s momentum. 2. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Putting the Bitcoin Blockchain on Steroids Bitcoin is undoubtedly the OG crypto and blockchain, but it wasn’t really built with Web3 adoption in mind. It only processes seven transactions per second, as opposed to Solana’s 2K-3K TPS. Enter Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) . This new meme coin on presale aims to build the first-ever Layer 2 on Bitcoin that will directly tackle the problems of scalability and programmability on the network. By leveraging a Canonical Bridge and integrating the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), it will convert your $BTC from a traditional L1 asset into a high-speed, scalable L2 asset. You’ll be able to use this ‘wrapped’ Bitcoin on L2 for lightning-fast payments and swaps, as well as lending and staking on DeFi apps, NFT platforms, and gaming dApps. Also, according to our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction, the token could be the next crypto to explode . It could reach $0.253 by 2030 – a nearly 2,000% gain from current prices . $HYPER is currently in presale, which is why you can buy it for a low price of $0.012075. Even though the presale is fresh out of the oven, it has amassed a chunky $1.7M so far. Here’s how to buy it . 3. Useless Coin ($USELESS) – Viral New Meme Coin with No Intrinsic Value or Utility Useless Coin ($USELESS) is the newest and perhaps the perfect epitome of what meme coins truly stand for: community-driven degen fun without any real utility or intrinsic value. With no staking, governance mechanisms, or revenue generation outside liquidity fees, $USELESS is almost a satirical take on all the other so-called utility tokens flooding the market right now. It launched just over a couple of weeks ago and has already gained over 92%. Currently trading at $0.1665 , $USELESS is hitting new all-time highs as we speak, so this might be a good time to get in. Wrapping Up With Donald Trump’s latest remarks on Bitcoin signaling renewed support for the crypto world, high-potential newcomers like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) and Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) can surge big time. That said, keep in mind that investments in crypto are highly risky.

This significant change aims to increase the network’s transaction speed, improve response time, and strengthen the performance of all ecosystem components. The Maxwell upgrade is the implementation of three key proposals, BEP-524, BEP-563 and BEP-564. Each of these proposals aims to further enhance the speed and reliability aspects of the BSC. With the new update: Block time will be reduced from 1.5 seconds to 0.75 seconds. Communication between validators will be improved. Block synchronization between nodes will be accelerated. These improvements will benefit all network participants, including users, developers, validators, and node operators. Related News: How Much Bitcoin Does Elon Musk Currently Hold?

2025-06-29T16:50:12,"Crypto Presale of the Year: Bitcoin Solaris Set to Outperform Bitcoin – Early Investors Positioned for Massive Gains","In every bull run, there’s that one project. The one people talk about for years. For many, Bitcoin was that moment in 2011. But in 2025, a new name is being whispered in all the right corners. It’s called Bitcoin Solaris. And if you blink, you might just miss it. While the crypto space is constantly buzzing with new launches and flashy tokens, few manage to combine technical brilliance, real-world utility, and the raw energy of a community ready to take flight. Bitcoin Solaris is positioning itself not just as another blockchain but as a wealth engine, engineered with speed, security, and scalability at its core. Bitcoin Was the Spark. Solaris Is the Flame. Bitcoin changed the financial world, but even the most loyal BTC holders know it wasn’t built for today’s pace. Slow block times and high fees are no longer charming relics, they’re limitations. That’s where Bitcoin Solaris steps in . BTC-S brings the legacy of Bitcoin’s security and fuses it with modern performance. The result? A blockchain that delivers 10,000 transactions per second with finality in just two seconds. But this is not just about speed. It’s about structure. Bitcoin Solaris features a powerful dual-consensus mechanism that uses Proof of Work for base-layer security and Delegated Proof of Stake for execution efficiency. The two layers operate in harmony, ensuring decentralization and speed coexist. Core Features That Make BTC-S Unstoppable Here’s what sets Bitcoin Solaris apart in a market flooded with promises: Dual-layer architecture that separates execution from consensus for optimized performance. Hybrid consensus ensures validators rotate securely while preventing centralization. Energy-efficient mining algorithm adjusted for mobile and lower-power devices. Smart contract functionality that supports advanced DeFi use cases. Cross-chain bridge development in progress for seamless asset transfers. The upcoming Solaris Nova app will allow users to mine using just a smartphone, unlocking massive global participation. And with over 12,800 users already onboard, the network effect is well underway. The Future of DeFi Doesn’t Run on Hype It Runs on BTC-S The Tokenomics Engine Fueling It All Scarcity, utility, and a long-term vision define the tokenomics behind BTC-S. With a fixed supply of 21 million BTC-S tokens, the breakdown is engineered for fairness and sustainability: 66.66 percent for mining rewards 20 percent for presale 5 percent for liquidity pools 2 percent each for ecosystem, marketing, community rewards, and staking Just 0.33 percent for team and advisors This design ensures the majority of tokens go to participants, not insiders. Presale Power: Why Investors Are Rushing In With only around five weeks left, the Bitcoin Solaris presale is generating massive buzz. Currently in phase 9 at $9 per token, the price is quickly approaching the $20 launch mark. Over $5.6 million has already been raised and the momentum shows no signs of slowing. Shortest presale in crypto history Over 12,800 users and counting Token Empire called it a “no-brainer” in a detailed video review Getting in early feels like catching Bitcoin at $1 except this time, there’s a roadmap and performance metrics to back it up. Users can buy tokens directly through Trust Wallet or MetaMask , making entry simple for both seasoned and new investors. A Miner’s Dream: Accessibility Meets Power Unlike traditional PoW systems that require warehouse-sized rigs, BTC-S mining is designed for everyone. Through the exciting release of the upcoming Solaris Nova app, users will soon be able to mine on smartphones using an adaptive energy-efficient algorithm. This isn’t theoretical. A live calculator on the official site already allows users to estimate their mining potential. The mining architecture is also reinforced by smart validator rotation. This ensures fair distribution and participation while maintaining robust decentralization. The Audits Say It All For those who care about security Bitcoin Solaris is already audited by Cyberscope and Freshcoins , providing added trust during the presale and beyond. The team is also engaging with the community directly through Telegram and X , offering transparency and updates straight from the source. Final Verdict: This Is That Moment Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just a project. It’s an opportunity. The kind that only comes once per cycle. With technical firepower, real adoption mechanics, and a presale model designed for maximum gain, it’s easy to see why early investors are already dreaming big. Missing early Bitcoin might haunt you. Catching Bitcoin Solaris at the right time might just be your redemption story.

2025-06-29T16:39:01,"The Rocket  Fueled: Bitcoin Supply Shock Incoming, Keiser Says","Bitcoin appears to be tightening its grip on market attention once again—this time not because of price volatility, but due to a looming structural scarcity that some of the asset’s most vocal supporters say is unfolding in real time. Max Keiser, Bitcoin advocate and advisor to El Salvador President Nayib Bukele , issued a clear statement on Tuesday, June 25, 2025, via his X account. “I’ve done the math. A Bitcoin supply shock is imminent,” Keiser posted, punctuating the forecast with a rocket emoji. The Bitcoin protocol permanently caps the total supply of Bitcoin (BTC) at 21 million coins. According to blockchain data, approximately 19.6 million Bitcoins have been mined, or about 93.3% of the total supply. That leaves roughly 1.4 million BTC yet to be created. That number is falling fast. This event, part of Bitcoin’s four-year issuance schedule, cut block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. As a result, the daily release of new coins dropped to approximately 450 BTC per day—down from around 900 before the halving. That drop in new supply arrives just as institutional demand shows no signs of easing. Since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved spot Bitcoin ETFs, institutional entities have poured billions into the asset. Data from early 2025 shows that ETFs, particularly BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), have absorbed large volumes of BTC. As of June 2025, BlackRock leads all ETF issuers with substantial Bitcoin holdings, outpacing even Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy, which now controls over 500,000 BTC. In January 2024 after the ETF approvals, Samson Mow warned of a double-edged market pressure: a supply shock from the halving and a demand shock from ETF buying. His view now seems to be taking shape. Mow and Keiser argue that market liquidity could dry up fast when these forces collide. Trading volumes also support the idea of a supply shock. On June 24, Bitcoin trading volume exceeded $3 billion in just one hour. Such spikes indicate growing participation from institutions and retail investors alike, especially during periods of market uncertainty. Bitcoin’s role as a potential store of value is also finding renewed interest amid global instability. The ongoing accumulation by large firms and new treasury entrants such as Metaplanet and ProCap BTC, recently co-founded by VC investor Anthony Pompliano, add weight to the notion that Bitcoin is becoming a preferred long-term asset . On June 25, 2025, Keiser’s remarks will be accompanied by a broader analysis of the changing dynamics in Bitcoin supply and demand. Analysts point to a structural shift—less Bitcoin is being created and more is locked away in institutional vaults. That imbalance already affects availability on exchanges, where reserves continue to drop. Keiser and Mow’s predictions are not new, but the timeline may tighten. With less than five million Bitcoin left to mine, and the next halving set for 2028—when block rewards will fall again to 1.5625 BTC—the pressure on circulating supply may continue to intensify. For now, the data shows demand rising while supply falls. Whether that translates to market movement remains to be seen. But Bitcoin’s architecture ensures one thing: the supply side will not expand. As of late June 2025, that’s no longer just a theoretical talking point—it’s becoming visible on the blockchain.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/the-rocket-fueled-bitcoin-supply-shock-incoming-keiser-says/,"BTC|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|BUSINESS","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare
2025-06-29T16:36:19,"Is Bitcoin Really Creating Jobs Like Trump Claims?","Bitcoin prices broke the $100,000 mark. President Donald Trump declared cryptocurrency “amazing” and praised it for “the jobs that it produces”. Trump has made a sharp U-turn, crediting Bitcoin for job growth and positioning the U.S. as a crypto leader. Trump’s remarks came at a White House news conference on June 27, 2025. He told reporters, “It’s become amazing … it’s the jobs that it produces.” The president even claimed credit for building a “crypto industry.” This follows months of pro-crypto actions by his administration, including new regulations and a push for a national Bitcoin reserve Trump argues that Bitcoin adoption is strategically vital and notes that crypto held up better than stocks in recent declines. But did Bitcoin really generate a significant wave of new U.S. jobs, as he claims? The U.S. civilian labor force is about 163 million, so 31,000 jobs are roughly 0.02% of all workers. By comparison, conventional industries add millions of jobs each year. Outside mining, the broader crypto industry — exchanges, fintech firms, and blockchain startups — also employs people, but comprehensive job tallies for those sectors are not readily available. Critics caution that Bitcoin’s benefits come with trade-offs. The group notes many crypto farms “fail to provide promised jobs” even as they pay low rates. Lawsuits over noise and pollution have followed rapid mining growth. Many Bitcoin mining jobs are technical roles (power technicians, engineers), often filled locally. Mining boosters highlight infrastructure and training investments in rural areas, but critics say those commitments do not always materialize. Trump’s job-creation claim has a basis, but it has important caveats. An April Perryman Group report confirms tens of thousands of U.S. jobs tied to Bitcoin mining, generating more than $4.1 billion in gross product annually for the U.S. economy. However, that is a very small slice of total U.S. employment. Those jobs are concentrated in a few energy-rich states and often rely on special power incentives. Analysts say the net economic impact must account for higher energy costs and community concerns.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/is-bitcoin-really-creating-jobs-like-trump-claims/,"BTC|MINING|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Donald Trump",cryptocompare

In December 2023, ORDI became the first BRC-20 token to breach $1 billion in market capitalization. Following this achievement, ORDI gained attention from DeFi enthusiasts for its role in innovation. The Ordinals protocol allows data to be embedded directly on Bitcoin’s smallest unit—the Satoshi. ORDI was the first token inscribed on the Ordinals protocol; like Bitcoin, it has a maximum supply of 21,000,000 coins. Currently trading at the $48 mark, investors can’t help but speculate on Ordi’s price trajectory. How high will ORDI go? Can ORDI surge 100x? What will the price of ORDI be in 2030?

The transaction between Bitcoin and Cardano was facilitated by BitVMX, an interoperability protocol built using the BitVM programming language and unveiled at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. Why is ORDI down? ORDI is in a bear run this year. The drop in the ORDI value could be attributed to the market’s correction from the bull run in the last quarter of 2024. Will ORDI recover? ORDI is trading at its lowest this year and is ripe for a reversal. It should recover in the coming months. Will ORDI reach $50? Yes, ORDI should rise above $50 in 2027. The move will come as the market recovers to previous highs. Will ORDI reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, ORDI will reach $100 in 2029 and reach a maximum price of $130.84. Will ORDI reach $1,000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely that ORDI will get to $1,000 before 2030. What is the prediction for Ordi in 2030? According to the 2030 Ordinals price prediction, they will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. What is the Sats ordinal price prediction for 2050? When we extrapolate Ordi’s price predictions, we find that it is likely to reach a high of $421 in 2050. Does ORDI have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, ORDI will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is ORDI a good investment? ORDI had the first-mover advantage on the Ordinals protocol. ORDI, like Bitcoin, has a capped supply of 21 million coins and should, therefore, become scarce over time. Our Cryptopolitan Price Prediction shows how the coin will gain value in the years to come.

Source: CoinStats According to CoinMarketCap, ORDi started trading in May 2023 at $25.3466. It later fell, reaching its lowest value of $2.86 in September 2023. Binance listed ORDI on November 17, 2023. However, due to a lack of clear information from Binance, there needed to be more clarity, leading many to mistakenly believe that ORDI was a direct product of the Ordinals protocol. This misunderstanding contributed to ORDI’s dramatic market performance. The meme coin saw a 40% increase in value within a single day, culminating in a 100% rise over four days. Despite these fluctuations, ORDI’s popularity surged, and by the end of 2023, its price had climbed above $50. ORDI peaked in March 2024, hitting an all-time high of $96.17. It later moved into a bear run, and by April, it had already dropped by 50%. It started recovering in November, rising above the $35 mark, and $48 in December. In 2025, the trend quickly reversed and fell below $12 in February and $8 in May.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ordinals-price-prediction/,"BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|ICO|ORDI|ZRX|BTC|MARKET","Crypto Price Predictions|ORDI",cryptocompare
2025-06-29T16:29:51,"Glassnode: ETFs, Macro Trends, and $114 Billion Futures Boom Drive Bitcoin Liquidity","The transformation of Bitcoin (BTC) from speculative novelty to a cornerstone of global finance is gaining momentum, with more than $544 billion in fresh capital flooding the network since late 2022. A new report from Glassnode and Avenir Group has uncovered a “liquidity trifecta” of on-chain dynamics, market microstructure, and macro linkages underpinning the original cryptocurrency’s maturation as a standalone asset class. The $550 Million Daily Money Machine According to the analysis , Bitcoin’s evolution has become visible in its on-chain fundamentals. Since March 2023, those investing in the crypto asset have locked in profits amounting to about $550 million daily, signifying a deep, mature market where participants have serious conviction, taking gains, knowing the market is strong enough to absorb it. The survey also found the action was just as intense off-chain, with Bitcoin futures and options becoming the new playground for big money. Total open interest went from $11.1 billion in late 2022 to $114 billion during BTC’s historic charge past $100,000 at the beginning of 2025, a testament that institutions are not just dipping their toes, but are diving into crypto headfirst. Other key signs of institutional accumulation came from analyzing market microstructure tools such as the Limit Order Book (LOB), which brought to light sophisticated liquidity patterns. For example, before the 2024 spot Bitcoin ETF approval, there was extreme sell-side pressure, which was replaced with a buy-side surge after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) greenlit the financial products. Similarly, Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) metrics exposed speculative vs. genuine demand, with Glassnode claiming that the current perpetual futures dominance suggests BTC’s latest rally is leaning speculative. Altcoins Get Left Behind The joint report also noted that Bitcoin’s sensitivity to macroeconomic forces has eclipsed its crypto-native cycles. Its price now moves tightly alongside the Global Liquidity Index (GLI) and traditional markets like the S&P 500, while moving against assets like the U.S. dollar. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have validated this macro alignment. While some critics had dismissed them as fleeting speculation when they were first introduced, Glassnode’s “unhedged demand” metric, which filters out arbitrage-driven flows, shows that they now represent genuine long-term institutional muscle. Meanwhile, the study revealed that altcoins are facing a liquidity crisis, with capital concentration mainly favoring Bitcoin and speculative meme coins on Solana. Per the data, in this cycle, funds going into altcoins dropped by a whopping $46 billion compared to the last boom. Ethereum, which once captured up to 65% of altcoin inflows, has since seen its share plummet to just 31%, with only Solana and XRP managing to outpace BTC. In Solana’s case, the uptick was fueled mainly by an explosion of meme coins, which saw their collective value shoot up 9,150% from $400 million to $37 billion. XRP has also had a wild ride of its own, with the anticipated resolution to a long-winded legal battle between the SEC and Ripple Labs over the token’s status, helping boost its value in the market on several occasions.

2025-06-29T16:21:23,"Texas is going Bitcoin: 3 tokens to stack as U.S. states embrace BTC reserves","Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Texas funds $10m Bitcoin reserve, setting stage for altcoin surge as ETF hopes and investor momentum grow. The Lone Star State just put its stamp on the future of finance. Texas has officially become the first U.S. state to authorize and actively fund a publicly managed Bitcoin reserve, thanks to the passage of Senate Bill 21 signed into law by Governor Greg Abbott. With $10 million allocated toward purchasing Bitcoin for the state treasury, the move is more than symbolic; it signals a broader institutional shift in how governments perceive and use digital assets. But here’s the real opportunity: Bitcoin’s rise is opening the door for several other cryptocurrencies to follow in its institutional footsteps, especially as ETF approval odds skyrocket for assets like Solana (SOL), Litecoin (LTC), and XRP. Behind the scenes, regulatory clarity is catching up, and analysts are calling this the next major green light for the altcoin market. For investors looking to front-run the next leg up, three standout tokens are gaining serious momentum, including a surprise meme-chain play under $0.002 that could eclipse them all. You might also like: From meme to the moon: Why LILPEPE might outperform XRP this bull cycle Little Pepe: The memecoin building a blockchain movement Texas may be going all in on Bitcoin, but forward-thinking investors are zeroing in on a radically different project with explosive upside: Little Pepe (LILPEPE) . Currently in Stage 3 of its presale at just $0.0012, LILPEPE isn’t just another frog-faced memecoin. It’s a fully engineered Layer 2 blockchain, explicitly built for memecoins, focusing on speed, scalability, and anti-bot security. As memecoins continue to dominate retail attention, LILPEPE is creating the rails they’ll run on and positioning itself as the Solana of meme tokens. Why it stands out: Zero tax and near-zero fees Sniper bot protection — a first in meme token design Dedicated memecoin launchpad Tokenomics built for long-term scale: 26.5% Presale 30% Chain Reserves 13.5% Staking 10% Liquidity 10% Marketing 10% DEX Listings Unlike most low-cap memecoins, LILPEPE is confirmed for two Tier-1 CEX listings at launch, with rumors circulating about a possible deal with the world’s largest crypto exchange. Add a $777,000 presale giveaway (10 winners will receive $77,000 in LILPEPE each), and we have one of the most anticipated altcoins of the year. Solana: Regulatory tailwinds and institutional demand Solana’s inclusion in ETF filings isn’t just a nod to its strong performance — it’s recognition of its maturing role in the crypto ecosystem. The SEC’s engagement with filings for a Solana ETF, with a final deadline set for October 10, 2025, suggests that the agency views SOL as a potential commodity, especially given that CFTC-regulated Solana futures are already trading. Analysts estimate a 95% chance of ETF approval, fueling renewed demand from institutional investors. Solana has already recovered from the FTX fallout and established itself as the backbone for multiple high-velocity applications, from DeFi and NFTs to on-chain games and social platforms like Dialect and DRiP. If the ETF gets the green light, SOL could see Bitcoin-level inflows from traditional finance players looking to diversify exposure without venturing too far from the blue-chip space. XRP: A regulatory favorite with ETF momentum XRP’s journey through the legal gauntlet has made it one of the best-positioned digital assets for regulatory clarity. The SEC said on January 30, 2025, that it had received a request for a spot XRP ETF. Big names, including Grayscale, Bitwise, and Franklin Templeton, are supporting it. Analysts expect almost specific approval because the final decision is due on October 17, 2025. Why the optimism? Regulators already view XRP as a commodity. It has CFTC-regulated futures contracts in place. A strong global remittance use case supports its real-world value. As Texas pioneers a Bitcoin reserve, states and municipalities will eventually seek diversified crypto treasuries. XRP, with its institutional-grade infrastructure and fast settlement system, is likely to be included. The bigger picture: Why states like Texas are setting the tone Texas isn’t alone. States like Arizona and New Hampshire have passed similar legislation, and many more are watching closely. What’s different about Texas is that it’s funding the reserve, showing commitment far beyond the performative level. And as Bitcoin ETFs normalize crypto exposure, it’s only a matter of time before states begin exploring other asset-backed reserves. This is where tokens like Solana, XRP, and LILPEPE come in. SOL brings scalability and developer activity. XRP offers remittance utility and legal clarity. LILPEPE taps into cultural energy while building its infrastructure, making it the highest-risk, highest-reward play of the three. Final thoughts: A portfolio strategy for the state-backed crypto era As regulations become clearer and more states adopt cryptocurrencies, the rules for both retail and institutional investors are changing. It’s no longer enough just to hold Bitcoin or Ethereum; investors need to find the next level of fundamental assets. Solana is a scalable smart contract platform. XRP is the compliance-first remittance tool. Little Pepe is the chain built for meme virality, web3 culture, and viral user onboarding. As Texas and others begin to normalize crypto treasuries, demand for high-conviction altcoins is expected to surge. For those willing to take action before the next leg up, now could be the time to stack before the rest of the country catches on.
