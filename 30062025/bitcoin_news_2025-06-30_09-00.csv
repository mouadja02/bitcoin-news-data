2025-06-30T06:53:52,"Last Time Bitcoin’s Price Did This XRP Skyrocketed 518% in 77 Days","With a $129 billion market cap to Bitcoin’s $2.1 trillion, XRP is about 6% the leading crypto’s weight by capitalization. By comparison, Ethereum held around 14% of Bitcoin’s market cap in June. The most bullish Ethereum and Ripple investors both see the potential in the ETH and XRP platforms to be as disruptive as Bitcoin and see future adoption on a similar scale. Ethereum bulls are focused on how its smart contract services could disrupt the massive and lucrative finance, insurance, and legal sectors. Meanwhile, the XRP army is focused on the vast opportunity for Ripple’s international payments services. In addition to Ripple’s very advanced business along the lines of global payments for big institutions, its XRP Ledger is finding more uses for XRP in decentralized finance. Here are four bullish signs that XRP’s price could be poised for another god candle sometime in 2025. 1. XRP vs. BTC in July Compared XRP has a substantially smaller market cap than Bitcoin. Crypto investors also view it as a more speculative risk-reward proposition. As a result, when Bitcoin prices go up or down, XRP’s price can move in the same direction, but with higher percentages of gains and losses. Expert Bitcoin analysts expect another big showing from the leading crypto in Q3 or Q4 of this year, like the rally from Nov. through Jan last year. Long-time futures trader and long-term Bitcoin bull Peter Brandt is calling for another 50% leg up for BTC by Aug. or Sept. Meanwhile, $200,000 BTC in 2025 and $500,000 by 2028 are in line with analyst expectations from Standard Chartered, Galaxy Digital, Ark Invest, and others. If XRP prices follow the same trend as the last rally and melt up the chart 10x faster than BTC, then the Ripple holders could see +500% gains in the event of $150,000 Bitcoin and +1,000% ROI in a matter of months in the event of $200,000 BTC. Now, no two markets are exactly the same, and previous results do not guarantee future performance. But by the same token, as Wall Street has long known— winners tend to win again, and big winners tend to win big again. So the question is does Ripple continue to have the same competitive advantages going into July that attracted such a higher percentage capital gain from crypto investors from Nov. to Jan? 2. SEC vs. Ripple Lawsuit Update Is the SEC lawsuit against Ripple Labs first filed in Dec. 2020 still ongoing? You could say so, but it has taken an almost comically bullish turn for Ripple and XRP yet again. The Southern District of New York’s Judge Analisa Torres came to Ripple’s rescue with a July 2023 ruling siding with the company against the SEC (at least partially). Torres ruled that XRP tokens did not meet the definition of unregistered securities, when it comes to their programatic sales on exchanges. But under the new Trump Administration, the SEC is now so crypto friendly, that in June Judge Torres rejected a sweetheart joint motion by the SEC and Ripple asking to cut its fine from $125 million to $50 million. Furthermore, the joint motion asked the court to remove its previously laid permanent injunction upon Ripple Labs not to violate any Act of Congress. The court denied the motion and the judge chastised the counter parties in the case for trying to over-step their authority. Markets can now see a difference plain as night and day between the Gensler SEC and the Atkins SEC that removes a massive source of long-term resistance to XRP price growth. Instead of prosecuting Ripple so over zealously that a federal judge ruled against the main argument in their case, the SEC is now getting blocked by the same judge for being too friendly. Meanwhile, XRP ETF applications are stacking up at the Securities and Exchange Commission as Wall Street demand for Ripple exposure grows. 3. XRP Ledger, Wormhole Lock In More Multi-chain XRP’s use case as a fast, reliable, low-fee international payments rail over RippleNet is it’s flagship operation. But the development of smart contract issuance on XRP Ledger is a massive opportunity for growth. A mid-June update from Ripple Labs highlighted some serious progress on XRPL. “A wave of new fiat-backed stablecoins are now live on the XRP Ledger including USDC, XSGD, EURØP, RLUSD, and USDB,” Ripple Labs noted in a blog update on 6/12. “The XRPL’s native digital asset XRP retains a pivotal role, supporting stablecoin use cases by enabling efficient liquidity between assets, powering fast settlement, and serving as a bridge in cross-currency transactions.” -Ripple Labs More recently, Ripple announced on 6/26, that it is partnering with the multi-chain platform Wormhole so XRPL network peers can use XRP on over 200 blockchain apps across +35 different cryptocurrency platforms. When Could Ripple Realistically Take Enough SWIFT Market Share At the XRP APEX 2025 conference in Singapore this June, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said XRP could capture 14% of SWIFT global payments volume in five years: “There are two parts to SWIFT today: messaging and liquidity. Liquidity is owned by the banks. I think less about the messaging and more about liquidity. If you’re driving all the liquidity, it is good for XRP… so I’ll say five years, 14%.” Popular YouTube podcaster and life insurance and financial services salesman Patrick Bet-David keeps stirring the pot with the claim that this could push XRP’s price to $1,000. How could Ripple take so much market share from SWIFT? The math is simple. SWIFT takes 1 – 5 business days to clear a transaction. RippleNet takes about five seconds. Meanwhile, SWIFT costs around $50 per transfer. Ripple costs about a tenth of a penny.

The last time that this altcoin made headlines was back in 2023, which was a halving year. Since then, it has trended below the $100 level as the crypto market has struggled to hold up gains. Now, once again, the altcoin may be gearing up for another major move as it is close to completing a rare Golden Cross formation . Litecoin Golden Cross Formation Is On The Horizon Golden Cross formations for Litecoin have been rare despite having been in the market for over a decade. There have only been two Golden Cross formations in the history of the cryptocurrency, meaning that this occurrence of this formation carries significant implications for the price. The Golden Cross formation happens when the 50-Week and the 200-Week moving averages cross each other, beckoning the return of the bulls. Crypto analyst and CMT-certified expert Tony “The Bull” Severino pointed out the importance of this formation. He highlighted that another Golden Cross is about to form for Litecoin and used the performance of the previous formations to show what could happen ahead of this cross. The first time that this Golden Cross appeared was back in 2017, and the crypto analyst revealed that the Litecoin price had seen a 700% increase ahead of the cross. Then again, in 2021, there was another Golden Cross of the 50-Week and 200-Week moving averages, which saw a 450% rally. However, something worthy of note is the fact that the Litecoin price rallies have always happened before the Golden Cross formation was complete. Given this trend, it is possible that Litecoin is on the cusp of another major price rally before the formation is complete. There also seems to have been some diminishing returns in how much the Litecoin price has rallied in response. Therefore, it is possible that the current rally may not be as high as the previous ones, but could still see an over 200% increase regardless. Besides, the analyst points out that a sizable rally would trigger the Golden Cross. Currently, the Litecoin price is still trading at around $87 at the time of writing. So, a 200% rally would put the altcoin’s price above the $200 mark. If it does follow the return patterns of the previous appearances of the Golden Cross, then a 450% rally would put it above $300, and a 700% rally would set it on a path to $500.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/litecoin-3rd-ever-golden-cross/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","Litecoin|Crypto Crypto news|litecoin|Litecoin Halving|litecoin news|Litecoin price|LTC|LTC news|LTC price|ltcusd|LTCUSDT",cryptocompare

2025-06-30T05:45:43,"Bhutan Bets on Binance Pay to Power Crypto-Backed Tourism Economy","Bhutan is going full tilt on crypto — not just to modernize its financial rails, but to attract high-value global travelers and build a digitally resilient economy. At the Digital Bhutan panel, co-hosted by Binance, officials laid out a clear vision: bring crypto out of theory and into everyday life. “Tourists complain they can’t use SWIFT or pay easily. Binance Pay fixes that,” said Damcho Rinzin, director of the department of tourism. Rinzin added that travelers are already using crypto to buy local goods — in one case, even groceries to cook their own meals. Bhutan’s ambitions remain modest, just 300,000 visitors a year. But it wants them to stay longer and spend more — with Binance Pay’s 40 million plus user base as a lever. Binance CEO Richard Teng framed it as a shift from speculation to infrastructure. “This is the first national crypto payments system,” Teng said. “The average crypto tourist spends $1,000 — nearly three times a regular tourist — and merchants receive instant settlements,” he added. With over 1,000 merchants onboarded, and zero fees on Binance Pay compared to steep charges from other providers, Bhutan hopes to build a community-driven, tech-savvy ecosystem that aligns with its values. DK Bank, which played a pioneering role in Bhutan’s early bitcoin mining efforts, is now spearheading crypto adoption on the ground. “Mobile and QR payments are already high,” said the bank’s CEO, Ugyen Tenzin said. “Crypto just fits,"" he added. ""And this is just the start,"" said Hobeng Lim, managing director of finance at Gelephu Mindfulness City. Gelephu Mindfulness City is a planned city in the country which merges technology, like blockchain, with culture, and sustainability., Lim added that they are many more blockchain-native projects in the pipeline, with digital assets formally recognized as a future growth engine. “Crypto is not a side experiment, It’s a core industry,” Lim said.

2025-06-30T05:30:59,"Top Analyst Predicts Major Ethereum Rally Toward $4,000 As Shorts Hit All-Time Highs","As the market’s second largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum (ETH), struggles to maintain momentum above the crucial $2,500 threshold, one analyst believes that ETH is poised for a significant rally. In a recent post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), crypto analyst Cyclop expressed a bullish outlook, labeling the current market conditions as the best long setup for Ethereum he has seen in years. Analyst Sees $4,000 Target This Summer Cyclop highlighted that Ethereum short positions have reached all-time highs, a situation reminiscent of a previous spike that occurred just weeks ago. The analyst noted that liquidity has been swept on both sides, creating a scenario where market uncertainty may actually benefit Ethereum. “Most doubt ETH and altcoins right now—I’m betting on $4,000 this summer,” he stated confidently. Related Reading: TD Sequential Flashes Buy: Dogecoin Ready For Rebound To $0.21 Cyclop outlined several key factors driving his optimistic stance. First, he pointed to the recent Pectra update, which has reinvigorated interest in Ethereum by enhancing transaction capabilities, updating security features, and improving staking options. This update has reportedly led to increased demand, contributing to a potential price surge. Moreover, Cyclop emphasized the broader macroeconomic landscape, noting that cryptocurrency adoption is accelerating beyond Bitcoin (BTC), with Ethereum taking a prominent role. The analyst suggests that major corporations and banks are beginning to purchase and stake Ethereum, further boosting trust and interest in the digital asset which could ultimately result in more demand and more price uptrends. Ethereum Rallies May Trigger Altcoin Boom On-chain metrics also favor Ethereum, with the cryptocurrency ranking highly in various categories, according to Cyclop. It currently stands as the second-highest by fees, leads in bridged net flows, and ranks third in stablecoin supply changes, showcasing its robust market position. Another critical aspect of Cyclop’s analysis concerns altcoins and the upcoming altseason, traditionally characterized by a rush of investment into Ethereum before spilling over into smaller tokens. He pointed out that historical patterns indicate that Ethereum price rallies often trigger broader altcoin surges, and the current market sentiment suggests that many altcoins are at their lowest ebb. Related Reading: Dogecoin Silent Build-Up: Double Bottom Hints At Explosive Move To $0.47 While Cyclop acknowledges that a majority of altcoins may face significant challenges, he argues that ETH remains undervalued, especially with Bitcoin trading near $100,000. He has made strategic moves, reallocating some of his Bitcoin holdings into Ethereum and promising strong altcoins. His initial target for Ethereum is $3,000, where he plans to take profits, followed by a series of sell orders between $4,000 and $6,000. As of press time, ETH trades at $2,500, a 12% price increase in the weekly time frame.

2025-06-30T05:30:58,"3 Things That Could Impact Bitcoin and Crypto Markets in Week Ahead","US stock markets surged last week, with major indexes approaching all-time highs on the easing of tensions in the Middle East and rising hopes for a Federal Reserve rate cut later this year. Crypto markets were a little slower to react, remaining mostly flat over the past week and into the weekend. The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, core PCE, showed that price increases accelerated in May, raising inflation concerns. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last week that he expects to see a pickup in inflation this summer, but reiterated his “wait and see” approach. On Sunday, President Trump commented on the July 9 deadline for the 90-day tariff pause, stating, “I don’t think I need to extend it, but could.” Economic Events June 30 to July 4 June’s ISM Manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI) is due on Tuesday. This report shows business conditions in the manufacturing sector and serves as a significant leading indicator of overall economic conditions. There are also job openings data due on Tuesday, which could reflect conditions in the labor market. Wednesday and Thursday will see more labor market reports, with nonfarm payrolls and unemployment figures released. These reports represent the number of new jobs created during the previous month, along with the percentage of people actively seeking employment. They are significant economic indicators, as the shift in the number of jobs is strongly associated with overall economic health. June’s ISM Services PMI, due on Thursday, will reflect business conditions in the services sector and is another leading economic indicator. Traditional markets are closed on Friday for the July 4 celebrations as we enter the second half of the year. Crypto Market Outlook Digital asset markets remained flat over the weekend but gained during early Asian trading on Monday morning to reach $3.46 trillion in total capitalization. Bitcoin has reached a two-week high, tapping $108,750 in early trading on Monday, but it faced resistance there yet again and fell back to $108,500 at the time of writing. The assed has struggled at this level at least five times over the past week where it has been rejected. Ethereum is doing a little better, having reached its support-turned-resistance level of $2,500 on Monday morning after a 2.8% gain. The altcoins were mostly in the green with minor gains, but Hyperliquid (HYPE) was leading the pack, adding 7.5% on the day to top $40.

While altcoins brace for significant bounce-backs, BNB Chain will officially roll out the Maxwell hardfork today, June 30, 2025. The upgrade aims to enrich Binance’s chain through enhanced efficiency and speed. BNB Chain @BNBCHAIN · Follow ⚠️ Maxwell Hardfork goes live in a few hours, here’s everything you need to know 🧵 👇 8:24 PM · Jun 29, 2025 130 Reply Copy link Read 56 replies First and foremost, Maxwell will halve BSC’s block time to only 0.75 seconds from 1.5 seconds, making it a sub-second platform. It’s noteworthy that today’s fork builds on last year’s Lorentz upgrade momentum, reflecting the team’s continued dedication to scalability, speed, and enriched user experience. BSC’s journey to efficiency: from Loretz upgrade to Maxwell BNB Chain is among the blockchain projects that take speed as a foundational element for success in the sector. It rolled out the Lorentz fork in April 2025 to reduce block times from 3 seconds to 1.5 seconds. The update brought noticeable enhancement across validator efficiency, dApp responsiveness, and DeFi performance. BNB Chain flourished after Lorentz. For instance, it delivered only a $0.04 transaction fee. Moreover, Dune’s data shows BSC outshined all decentralized exchanges (DEXs) in daily volume. Source – Dune Analytics Meanwhile, the Maxwell upgrade will take these advancements to another level. Node operators, developers, and users can anticipate smooth app interactions and swift transaction confirmations. What to expect with Maxwell hardfork? The latest upgrade transforms BNB Smart Chain’s ecosystem with three main improvements. Firstly, it introduces BEP-524 to slash the block interval to 0.75 seconds. That means doubling BSC’s transaction throughput capability. Users will enjoy accelerated offerings from minting and token swaps to smart contract execution and GameFi activities. Secondly, Maxwell enhanced validator messaging by enhancing existing p2p communication models. That will reduce possible syncing lags, boosting network stability even during faster activities. Validators will experience fewer delays when proposing and voting on blocks. Finally, the BPE-564 standard introduces two messaging mechanisms, GetBlocksByRangeMsg and RangeBlocksMsg. These will enable nodes to synch massive block groups at once, enriching syncing speed and reliability across the BSC network. The Maxwell update isn’t about boosting speed alone. It represents a strategic step toward a more efficient and faster blockchain future. The upgrade reflects BSC’s dedication to dominating web3 adoption amid renewed demand for responsive performance in NFTs, DeFi, and online gaming. BNB price outlook The native token displayed bullishness as enthusiasts brace for network enhancements. BNB trades at $655 after rebounding from the support at $642. Chart by Coinamrketcap Its increasing daily trading volume suggests a possible upward continuation. Continued bullishness amid the Maxwell upgrade and broad market uptrends could fuel BNB’s price to the next resistance at $720. A breakout might propel the token to the crucial obstacle at $760, beyond which BNB will shift its trajectory to bullishness. However, sudden selling pressure might cause the token to plunge to the support barrier at $520-$540.

2025-06-30T05:30:07,"Why is Bitcoin Stuck at $100,000 and Not Rising? Analyst Explains the Real Reason","Charles Edwards, CEO of cryptocurrency analysis company Capriole Investments, made remarkable statements about the stagnation in the Bitcoin price and recent market dynamics. According to Edwards, the reason Bitcoin is stuck at $100,000 levels despite the interest (FOMO) from institutional investors is due to selling pressure from long-term investors. Edwards stated that since the spot ETF launch in January 2024, long-term Bitcoin holders (LTH) have been selling to Wall Street and liquidating their positions. Stating that this situation is reflected in the media in different ways, Edwards argued that the real reason is these sales. The CEO recalled a prediction he made in April, saying that companies holding Bitcoin treasury would create a “flywheel” effect, triggering a massive buying wave in the market and pushing the ETF narrative to the background. Edwards said that this effect is now clearly visible and many new companies are joining this trend. Related News: Latest Report on Cryptocurrency Owners in South Korea Released - Major Changes Are Underway, Here Are the Trends Examining on-chain data, Edwards explained that there has been a huge increase in the number of investors holding BTC for more than 6 months in the last two months, and that the purchases made by this group more than covered all the BTC sold by LTHs in the last 1.5 years. He evaluated this situation as “incredible.” Edwards also stated that such aggressive increases are usually followed by price squeezes, which is a short-term bullish sign. However, Edwards noted that there is still some weakness in the general on-chain data, and stated that recovery is possible if this buying momentum continues: “Can Treasury companies continue this rapid pace of buying? I think this cycle is just beginning. If aggressive buying by investors with a 6-month holding continues, the market could overcome this weakness.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-30T05:30:00,"BTC Could Surge as Youth Lose Faith in Traditional Finance","Market strategist Jordi Visser argues that economic disillusionment among younger generations, combined with rapid advancements in AI and automation, will erode faith in traditional capitalist models and fuel demand for decentralized assets like Bitcoin. Former President Donald Trump also weighed in by praising Bitcoin’s role in alleviating pressure on the US dollar and subtly referencing the Triffin Dilemma. This is a core flaw in the dollar’s global reserve status. Meanwhile, Human Rights Foundation’s Alex Gladstein pointed out Bitcoin’s use as a shield against authoritarian control due to its censorship-resistant qualities and historical utility in pro-democracy movements. With increasing distrust in fiat currencies, ballooning government debt, and weakening institutional credibility, all of these narratives come together to present Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a growing pillar in both economic realignment and individual empowerment. Younger Generations Turning to Bitcoin Market analyst Jordi Visser offered a provocative outlook on the future of Bitcoin, and suggested that the disillusionment of younger generations with the existing economic order could be a major force behind the cryptocurrency’s long-term price appreciation. On a recent episode of entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano’s podcast, Visser said that people aged 25 and younger are becoming increasingly skeptical of capitalism and are instead advocating for a new system rooted in greater public spending and expansive social benefits. This generational shift, he argues, is being fueled by economic uncertainty, the erosion of trust in traditional institutions, and the looming threat of widespread job displacement caused by artificial intelligence. According to Visser, the growing frustration and lack of faith in the current system are prompting governments to ramp up spending to try and placate the masses—an action that inevitably leads to more money printing. He believes that this ongoing reliance on fiat currency and debt-driven economics will only strengthen the case for Bitcoin as an alternative store of value. “The more people are angry, the more money the government has to print,” Visser explained. This cycle of monetary expansion will drive Bitcoin’s price higher over time, regardless of public perception or institutional resistance. He predicts that Bitcoin will increasingly replace fiat assets as it becomes a more trusted financial instrument. AI protest Visser also issued a broader warning about the long-term viability of capitalism itself. He suggested that the rapid development of AI and robotic technologies—especially humanoid robots and autonomous vehicles—could make human labor obsolete, further concentrating wealth in the hands of a few and destabilizing the capitalist framework. He believes this technological shift is imminent, with commercial adoption of self-driving cars and robotic labor likely within five years. These kinds of advancements, he said, will act as a wake-up call for society. He beieleves it will force a reevaluation of existing economic models and accelerate interest in decentralized assets like Bitcoin. Trump Says Bitcoin Eases Pressure on the Dollar President Donald Trump also recently expressed his strong support for Bitcoin by praising its growing role in the US economy during a White House press conference on Friday. Trump described the cryptocurrency industry as “amazing,” due to its job creation potential and increasing use as a means of payment. He suggested that Bitcoin helps relieve pressure on the US dollar, a statement that digital asset researcher Anders X believes alludes to the Triffin Dilemma. This is a long-standing economic conflict where the issuer of the world’s reserve currency must sacrifice domestic monetary stability to meet global demand for liquidity. As the issuer of the global reserve currency, the United States is required to maintain persistent trade deficits in order to supply enough dollars to the global market. While this practice supports international trade and provides a short-term solution to global liquidity needs, it undermines the long-term value of the dollar due to ongoing money creation. This systemic contradiction fuels concerns about currency debasement and inflation. Trump’s previous comments about potentially paying off national debt with Bitcoin means that there is a growing awareness of the contrast between the inflation-prone dollar and Bitcoin’s capped supply. Critics, however, point out that even if the US Treasury were to acquire the entire Bitcoin supply, it would fall far short of covering the nation’s ballooning $37 trillion debt . With deficits continuing to rise, many analysts believe this debt trajectory is unsustainable and could ultimately lead to a collapse in the dollar’s value. Macroeconomist Lyn Alden captured this sentiment with the now-famous phrase “nothing stops this train.” This reflects the consensus that governments will continue printing money indefinitely. This pessimism is already playing out in financial markets. The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the dollar’s strength against a basket of other major currencies, recently fell to its lowest level in three years. At the same time, US government bond yields are still elevated, which signals weakening investor confidence in the government’s ability to manage its debt responsibly. Bitcoin Rescues People From Tyranny At the Bitcoin Policy Summit in Washington, D.C., Human Rights Foundation chief strategy officer Alex Gladstein addressed a room of American political leaders, and talked about Bitcoin’s critical role in countering authoritarian regimes. Gladstein pointed out that Bitcoin continues to prove itself as a powerful financial tool for people living under oppressive governments by offering a decentralized alternative to state-controlled fiat systems. According to him, when used correctly—without tying personal identity to transactions—Bitcoin makes it a lot harder for governments to monitor, freeze, or seize individual assets. Gladstein stated that one of Bitcoin’s most valuable features is its resistance to manipulation by authoritarian leaders. Unlike fiat currencies, which can be inflated or weaponized to exert control over citizens, Bitcoin cannot be hyperinflated, and self-custodied wallets remain outside the reach of state interference. “If you’re self-custoding your Bitcoin, governments can’t delete or freeze your stuff, and they certainly can’t hyperinflate you,” he said. He shared that the Human Rights Foundation first recognized Bitcoin’s potential during Ukraine’s 2013 pro-democracy protests against then-President Viktor Yanukovych. Protesters at the time faced frozen bank accounts, yet Bitcoin provided a way to receive financial support when traditional banking systems failed. Despite initial skepticism—Bitcoin was valued at just $100 then—the technology proved very effective when it came to delivering funds across borders and into the hands of those fighting for democratic freedoms. Gladstein concluded that Bitcoin already helped countless people escape the financial reach of authoritarian governments and continues to do so. Since joining the Human Rights Foundation in 2007, he saw firsthand how the technology empowers people in regions where human rights are regularly violated. According to him, Bitcoin is not just a technological innovation but a tool for resistance, making it, as he put it, “bad for dictators.”",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9743/btc-could-surge-as-youth-lose-faith-in-traditional-finance,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

The company reported a loss of €3.3 million ($3.86 million) in 2024, a 15.8% increase from the previous year. As a result, the beleaguered Vanadi has pivoted to a shift in its strategy, adopting Bitcoin as its primary reserve asset. “Vanadi Coffee has adopted a number of financial instruments to support its Bitcoin strategy since last April and will use Bitcoin as a strategic store of value in its new business model,” the coffee chain said in an official announcement . Vanadi Coffee’s Billion-Euro BTC Play The coffee chain has taken its cue from major international players that are betting big on a similar BTC strategy, including Saylor’s Strategy and Japanese Metaplanet . The company said that it is aiming to accumulate “large amounts of Bitcoin” as part of its treasury. Further, it said that Bitcoin investment is a long-term commitment. “Vanadi Coffee is diversifying its business into Bitcoin investment and management and other cryptocurrency-related areas,” the coffee chain noted. Further, the firm aims to create a strategic window for investors, given the scarcity of BTC treasury companies listed in Spain and EU markets.

He admitted he was initially late to the game, buying his first Bitcoin at $6,000. At the time, it felt expensive. But looking back, he wishes he had purchased more. WHAT IS EXPENSIVE? I was late into Bitcoin. I waited too long….which may have been a good thing. I waited because I did not understand today’s modern money. So I bought my first Bitcoin at $6000 a coin. It was expensive. Today I wish I had bought more at $6000. Today… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) June 30, 2025 He shared his regret about not buying more gold, silver, and Bitcoin earlier. He blames his hesitation on being too focused on fiat money, which he calls “fake money.” He also reflected on how many people regret not chasing their dreams, especially later in life. Buying Bitcoin at $107K Now that Bitcoin trades around $107,000, Kiyosaki acknowledges the same feeling, thinking it’s too expensive. Yet, he’s still buying more. His reasoning is quite simple, as he explains that if Bitcoin hits $1 million , he knows he’ll look back on today’s price and feel the same regret for not buying more. That’s why he urges people to stop obsessing over price tags and instead pay attention to how much of an asset they own. He believes poor people tend to focus too much on price, while the wealthy focus on accumulating quantity. Whether it’s gold, silver, or Bitcoin, Kiyosaki says he doesn’t worry about daily price swings. For him, the key is building up holdings over time, not trying to time the perfect entry. [post_titles_links postid=”476645″] Power on One Satoshi Kiyosaki encouraged even small investors to participate. Even if someone can only afford one Satoshi, the smallest unit of Bitcoin, he believes they’ll be grateful in five years. In his view, a Satoshi bought today could carry significant value in the future. Based on historical trends, if Bitcoin continues to double in price every 4–5 years, even a small investment could yield big returns. A 2023 MIT study found that adding crypto assets to a portfolio could reduce long-term risk by up to 15%. Although he doesn’t claim to know whether Bitcoin will reach $1 million, Kiyosaki made it clear that in hindsight, every previous price point feels like a bargain. He describes the $107,000 Bitcoin as “priceless,” emphasizing the long-term potential of the asset rather than its current cost.

The company issued an update on June 29 via X, outlining a phased recovery process starting with verified users. According to the statement, only spot wallets are being unlocked initially, with other wallet types to follow once identity verification is completed. Users are being asked to wait for confirmation before attempting to access their balances, which will be displayed gradually as the security checks proceed. Follow- up on Nobitex Security Incident, Step-by-step wallet access has begun, 29 June 2025 Please note: 1. This process is being carried out gradually, starting with verified users and initially for spot wallets, followed by other types of wallets. 2. The identity… — Nobitex | نوبیتکس (@nobitexmarket) June 29, 2025 “Once the accuracy and security of all information is confirmed, Nobitex will begin displaying wallet balances in phases,” the exchange wrote. Nobitex expects the process to finish by mid-week but noted that timelines could shift based on technical and security considerations. The exploit , carried out on June 18, was claimed by Gonjeshke Darande, a pro-Israel group also known as Predatory Sparrow. Blockchain investigators say roughly $90–100 million in digital assets were drained from hot wallets across Ethereum ( ETH ) and Tron ( TRX ), including Bitcoin ( BTC ), ETH, and Dogecoin ( DOGE ). You might also like: Over $90M stolen from Iran’s Nobitex exchange burnt by pro-Israel hacker group As part of its post-attack response, Nobitex is migrating to a new wallet system. The firm warned users not to deposit funds into previously used addresses, noting that any deposits to old wallets may result in permanent loss. “If your old deposit address is connected to a mining rig or saved as a default withdrawal address in a blockchain service, make sure to delete it an,” the update advised, stressing the risk of sending funds to invalid wallets. The hackers reportedly accessed the platform using employee credentials compromised earlier via infostealer malware. The breach exposed parts of Nobitex’s internal systems, including source code and server data, which were later leaked online. Nobitex, which has processed more than $11 billion in inflows to date, holds a dominant position among Iran-based exchanges. Chainalysis has previously linked it to illicit activities by ransomware groups affiliated with Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and sanctioned Russian entities. With user access gradually resuming and trading features still disabled, the exchange is working to stabilize operations and restore trust. “We are working to resume withdrawal, deposit, and trading services for verified users with minimal delay,” the exchange said. Full platform functionality is expected to return in the coming days, though Nobitex has warned that the timeline may be revised depending on the results of ongoing system checks.

2025-06-30T04:30:30,"Best Crypto Presales for 2025: Experts Select Top New Cryptocurrencies for High Potential Returns","As Bitcoin approaches $108,000 and altcoins regain strength on the back of ETF momentum, institutional flows, and regulatory optimism, presale tokens are emerging as key opportunities for investors seeking outsized gains. Analysts are pointing to a mix of politically charged meme tokens, high-speed Layer-2s, and payment solutions as the top crypto bets of the second half of 2025. Here are the six presales experts are watching closely: MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGAFINANCE) Positioned as the political meme coin of 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing early interest with bold branding and rapid momentum. Analysts note that it has already become a focus for high-risk, high-reward traders looking for aggressive ROI setups before broader market exposure. With a campaign-driven narrative and increasing mentions in early presale rankings, MAGACOIN FINANCE may be emerging as the cycle’s standout meme contender. Early investors and market analysts are closely tracking its high-volume interest and accelerated wallet activity. MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t aiming for utility—it’s engineered for attention, speculation, and potential fast-paced growth. In a market increasingly driven by narrative and emotion, this token appears designed to dominate headlines and trader sentiment as listings draw near. Qubetics ($TICS) Qubetics is positioning itself as a Layer-1 Web3 aggregator. It has raised over $18 million and confirmed a top-tier exchange listing. Its roadmap includes tools like a multi-chain wallet and tokenization marketplace, though some concerns remain around delivery timelines. Solaxy (SOLX) Solaxy is a Layer-2 solution for Solana with deflationary tokenomics and a $58 million presale. It launched in late June 2025 with cross-chain capabilities and high staking APYs, but transparency issues and future execution are under watch. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) Bitcoin Hyper brings Solana-like speed to a Bitcoin-secured network, using SVM for scaling. With audit clearance and a Q3 2025 launch, HYPER is drawing some attention—but still early-stage. BTC Bull ($BTCBULL) BTC Bull ties its meme token value to Bitcoin price milestones, triggering burns and rewards. Backed by community hype and a bullish BTC trend, it’s speculative but may benefit from macro momentum. Remittix (RTX) Remittix offers crypto-to-fiat remittance infrastructure with flat fees and multi-currency support. It’s raised over $15 million and targets financial utility, though competition in PayFi remains high. Final Words While multiple presales are gaining attention in 2025, none are commanding momentum quite like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Built for speed, speculation, and cultural virality, it’s leading the charge as the token most likely to deliver outsized returns this cycle. Traders hunting for the next 50x or 100x return are increasingly viewing MAGACOIN FINANCE as more than a meme—it’s becoming a cultural signal in 2025’s crypto cycle. With listing anticipation building and retail FOMO increasing, experts suggest this could be the year MAGACOIN FINANCE dominates presale performance charts. As other projects navigate roadmaps and utility narratives, MAGACOIN FINANCE is already turning heads with raw buyer interest and breakout potential. For traders seeking pure upside in a hype-driven market, this is the name to watch.

However, MSTR is up 27% year-to-date, beating the broader market, and MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin stash is now nearing 600,000 BTC. Saylor Hints at Another Bitcoin Buy Recently, Saylor shared the company’s BTC tracker on X, showing that they are just 7,655 short of 600K. His posts usually come right before a new purchase. Last week, it added $26M worth of BTC, and another buy could mark its record 12-week streak. With over $21B in unrealized profit, Strategy shows no signs of slowing its Bitcoin accumulation.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-are-microstrategy-insiders-selling-millions-in-stock-while-bitcoin-booms/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET","News|Bitcoin|Crypto news",cryptocompare
