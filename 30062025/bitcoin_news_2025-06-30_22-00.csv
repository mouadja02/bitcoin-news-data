2025-06-30T19:55:17,"US Government To Be Hit With $3,300,000,000,000 in Additional Deficits Under Senate Tax Bill: CBO","The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) says that the government will have to take on an extra $3.3 trillion in deficits if the White House’s Big Beautiful Bill passes. In a new report , the non-partisan budget watchdog says that the bill would add $3.9 trillion to the national debt, stemming from roughly $4.5 trillion in net tax cuts and nearly $300 billion in spending increases, partially offset by almost $1.5 trillion in spending cuts. The CBO also estimates that the bill will increase debt interest costs by nearly $700 billion. “Even these numbers understate the potential costs of the bill, since the legislation relies on a number of arbitrary expirations. Borrowing could rise by another $1 trillion – to $5 trillion or more – if temporary provisions were made permanent. The Senate should reject this bill and work toward a fiscally responsible alternative that reduces rather than explodes our high and rising debt.” Senate GOP leaders are targeting around July 4 to complete the bill’s passage, but progress is uncertain due to internal resistance and looming deadlines. Earlier this month, billionaire Paul Tudor Jones said that the US government is in a debt trap, and will need to run negative real rates – or set interest rates lower than the rate of inflation, in order to devalue its debt. Jones says that the “playbook is clear” as far as what the government is going to need to do, giving an edge to investors looking to position themselves. Besides stocks, he mentions Bitcoin ( BTC ) and gold as portfolio staples moving forward. “We’re going to have negative real rates and that’s why you have to think about what is facing our policy makers in this debt trap as you construct your portfolio. So, what would an ideal portfolio be in something like that? Well, what has worked so far? What has worked so far has been some combination of stocks – which won’t do great, which would do terribly if they called us out on the bond market… But it would be some combination of probably volatility-adjusted Bitcoin, gold, stocks. That’s probably your best portfolio to fight inflation.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-30T19:54:52,"Was XRP Created to Fix Bitcoin’s Flaws?","Focusing when Bitcoin launched in 2009, it introduced the world to decentralized money. But by 2011, some early blockchain developers were already discussing its trade-offs—particularly slow transactions, high energy use, and limited scalability. XRP was born from that debate . According to a quote shared by crypto commentator Xaif on X in June 2025, Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen recalled the project’s founding intent: “In the beginning, we wanted to build a better Bitcoin… and we created XRP.” It wasn’t a rivalry, he said—it was a redesign. XRP Technical Starting Point The XRP Ledger (XRPL) was developed by engineers David Schwartz, Jed McCaleb, and Arthur Britto. They began working on it in 2011, aiming to create a faster, more scalable, and sustainable digital asset for payments compared to Bitcoin. The project was initially named “Ripple.” Bitcoin, whose blockchain can handle only around seven transactions per second, or ETH, which handles around 15, XRP’s blockchain can handle 1,500 transactions per second. XRP was launched in June 2012. While the technology was independent, Ripple Labs (originally OpenCoin) was founded shortly after to develop enterprise use cases based on it. Chris Larsen joined Ripple in 2012 as CEO. Under his leadership, the company focused on payments infrastructure. Instead of trying to replace the financial system, Ripple aimed to integrate with it, offering banks and financial institutions tools for real-time gross settlement and foreign exchange. XRP was designed as a bridge currency. It allowed value to move between two different fiat currencies instantly without requiring pre-funded nostro accounts. Products like xRapid and later On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) leveraged XRP’s speed and low transaction cost. According to Ripple’s Q1 2025 Markets Report, over 80% of its global remittance volume is now processed using ODL. The XRP Ledger processed over 170 million transactions in the first quarter alone. Beyond Payments: The XRPL in 2025 Today, XRP’s purpose goes beyond remittances. The XRP Ledger now supports Ethereum-compatible smart contracts via its EVM sidechain. It also enables pilot programs for tokenized assets, stablecoins, and even central bank digital currency (CBDC). According to data from XRPScan in June 2025, the number of XRP whale wallets holding over 1 million XRP reached a 12-year high of 2,708. This surge in whale activity, coupled with a sevenfold increase in daily active addresses, indicates growing investor confidence in XRP. XRP price rose 2.02% on Saturday, June 28, following Friday’s 1.8% gain, closing at $2.1865. The token outperformed the broader market, which gained 0.59%, lifting the total crypto market cap to $3.26 trillion. This philosophical difference continues to shape both assets. While Bitcoin remains a decentralized store of value and inflation hedge, XRP is positioned as a utility asset for institutional finance. Thirteen years after the XRP Ledger’s launch, that vision still drives the protocol’s evolution—and explains why it’s increasingly viewed not as a Bitcoin competitor, but as a complementary part of the blockchain ecosystem.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/was-xrp-created-to-fix-bitcoins-flaws/,"XRP|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|WALLET|MARKET","Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News",cryptocompare
2025-06-30T19:52:00,"BitMine Stock Skyrockets 500% as $250M Funding Shift to Ether Targets 16X ETH Holdings","BitMine Immersion Technologies’ stock exploded 511% on June 30 after revealing a $250M private placement—all earmarked for Ethereum (ETH) accumulation, marking a dramatic shift from Bitcoin mining to ETH treasury strategies. This move not only shakes up BitMine’s business model but also places Ethereum front and center in the company’s long-term vision, with industry heavyweight Thomas Lee now serving as board chairman. BitMine Bets on Ethereum as Treasury Reserve Asset BitMine, which recently uplisted to the NYSE American in June, previously raised $18 million in a public offering used to purchase 100 BTC . That marked its initial step toward crypto treasury holdings. BitMine is raising $18 million through a public stock offering as it looks to expand its Bitcoin holdings and deepen its treasury strategy. #BitMine #Bitcoin https://t.co/7gPZMi9F3h — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 5, 2025 However, the latest move towards Ethereum represents a major escalation in ambition, as the firm now plans to increase its crypto reserves by more than 16-fold, with Ethereum becoming its primary treasury reserve asset. According to the company’s Monday filing , BitMine will issue 55,555,556 common shares at $4.50 each, raising gross proceeds of approximately $250 million. The offering is expected to close by July 3, pending customary approvals from the NYSE American. Investment firm MOZAYYX leads the private placement and includes participation from several high-profile investors, such as Founders Fund, Pantera Capital, Republic Digital, Kraken, Galaxy Digital, FalconX, DCG, and Diametric Capital. Thomas Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, also participated in the deal and was named Chairman of BitMine’s Board of Directors. Thomas Lee described Ethereum as a “higher beta” asset than Bitcoin due to its foundational role in stablecoin transactions, decentralized finance (DeFi), and tokenized assets. He cited comments from U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who projected the stablecoin market could grow from $250 billion today to $2 trillion by 2028. “Ethereum is the blockchain where the majority of stablecoin payments are transacted, and thus ETH should benefit from this growth,” Lee said in the company’s statement. According to its announcement, the company will work with FalconX, Kraken, and Galaxy Digital to help manage execution, liquidity, and infrastructure support for its Ethereum strategy, while BitGo and Fidelity Digital Assets have been selected as custodians for BitMine’s ETH treasury holdings. BitMine Pivot from Bitcoin: Market Reaction and Shareholder Impact Investor response was immediate and sharp. BitMine’s stock price jumped from $4.26 to $26.06, representing a 511.02% intraday increase, according to Yahoo Finance data. The stock reached that level at 1:47 p.m. EDT, lifting the company’s market cap from under $31 million to approximately $158.87 million. While the private placement is expected to dilute existing shareholders, the firm’s aggressive ETH strategy could help position it among the leading corporate holders of Ethereum.

2025-06-30T19:50:13,"Metaplanet Soars: TSE Lifts Margin Trading Limits, Igniting Japanese Crypto Market Excitement","BitcoinWorld Metaplanet Soars: TSE Lifts Margin Trading Limits, Igniting Japanese Crypto Market Excitement Are you ready for a potential seismic shift in the Japanese financial landscape? For crypto enthusiasts and traditional investors alike, recent news from Japan signals a monumental development. Metaplanet , a company making significant waves in the Bitcoin space, is at the heart of this exciting announcement. The Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) is set to remove its margin trading restrictions on Metaplanet, effective July 1. This isn’t just a technical adjustment; it’s a powerful statement that could reshape investment strategies and accelerate Bitcoin Adoption Japan . What’s Behind the Lifting of Margin Trading Limits for Metaplanet? The news broke directly from Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich, who announced on X that the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) will lift its margin trading restrictions on the company. This decision, effective July 1, is a significant vote of confidence from one of the world’s largest stock exchanges. But what exactly does this mean? Margin trading allows investors to borrow funds to amplify their trading positions. While it offers the potential for higher returns, it also carries increased risk. Regulators often impose limits on margin trading for specific stocks to mitigate volatility or protect investors, especially when a stock is deemed to be highly speculative or experiencing unusual price movements. The removal of these limits suggests that the TSE now views Metaplanet as a more stable and mature investment vehicle, worthy of standard trading conditions. For Metaplanet, a company that has strategically positioned itself as a major holder of Bitcoin, this move is nothing short of transformative. It signals a new phase of accessibility and liquidity for their stock, potentially attracting a broader range of investors, both retail and institutional, who might have previously been deterred by the restrictions. How Does This Impact Metaplanet and Its Investors? The lifting of margin trading limits on Metaplanet shares is a multifaceted development with several key implications: Increased Liquidity: With fewer restrictions, more traders can engage in margin trading of Metaplanet stock. This typically leads to higher trading volumes and improved liquidity, making it easier for investors to buy and sell shares without significantly impacting the price. Enhanced Investor Access: Investors who rely on margin accounts to manage their portfolios will now have unrestricted access to Metaplanet shares. This broadens the potential investor base and could lead to increased demand for the stock. Reduced Perceived Risk: The TSE’s decision can be interpreted as a stamp of approval. It suggests that the exchange no longer views Metaplanet’s stock as excessively volatile or speculative, which could improve investor confidence and attract more conservative funds. Potential for Price Appreciation: Greater demand, increased liquidity, and improved investor confidence could collectively contribute to a positive price trajectory for Metaplanet shares. Strategic Alignment: For Metaplanet, whose core strategy revolves around accumulating Bitcoin and becoming a proxy for Bitcoin exposure in traditional markets, this move strengthens its position. It aligns the company more closely with established financial norms, even while dealing with a novel asset class like Bitcoin. Consider the analogy of a high-growth startup that initially faces strict lending terms. As it matures and demonstrates stability, those terms are eased, allowing for greater financial flexibility and broader market acceptance. Metaplanet appears to be undergoing a similar transition in the eyes of the Tokyo Stock Exchange . Is This a Catalyst for Bitcoin Adoption Japan ? Metaplanet’s business model is unique and highly relevant to the cryptocurrency space. The company has publicly declared its strategy to acquire and hold Bitcoin, effectively making its stock a way for traditional investors to gain exposure to the leading cryptocurrency without directly buying it. In this context, the TSE’s decision has profound implications for Bitcoin Adoption Japan . Japan has historically been a significant player in the crypto market, being one of the first countries to regulate cryptocurrencies. However, its regulatory environment has also been cautious. The TSE’s move to ease restrictions on a Bitcoin-centric company like Metaplanet sends a strong signal that mainstream financial institutions are becoming more comfortable with crypto-adjacent investments. This could: Legitimize Bitcoin Exposure: By treating Metaplanet like any other stock, the TSE implicitly legitimizes the concept of public companies holding significant Bitcoin reserves. This could encourage other Japanese corporations to explore similar strategies. Bridge Traditional and Crypto Markets: Metaplanet acts as a crucial bridge. Its increased accessibility on the TSE means more traditional investors, who might not be comfortable with crypto exchanges, can still participate in Bitcoin’s growth story through a regulated stock market vehicle. Pave the Way for Further Integration: This development might be a precursor to broader integration of digital assets into Japan’s mainstream financial system. It could inspire regulators to consider more permissive frameworks for crypto-related products and services. The journey towards widespread Bitcoin adoption is often characterized by incremental steps that build trust and familiarity. The TSE’s decision on Metaplanet is undoubtedly one such step, especially within a major global economy like Japan. Navigating the Evolving Japanese Crypto Market Landscape The Japanese Crypto Market has a rich history, marked by both innovation and challenges. From being an early adopter of Bitcoin to experiencing major exchange hacks (like Mt. Gox and Coincheck), Japan has seen it all. Yet, it has consistently maintained a proactive stance on regulation, aiming to foster a secure and compliant environment for digital assets. The lifting of Margin Trading Limits on Metaplanet underscores a maturing approach. It reflects a growing understanding among regulators and traditional financial bodies of how to integrate digital assets, or companies heavily invested in them, into existing market structures. This isn’t just about Metaplanet; it’s about the broader direction of travel for the entire Japanese financial sector. Actionable Insights for Investors: What Should You Consider? For investors eyeing the Japanese Crypto Market and specifically Metaplanet , the upcoming removal of margin trading limits presents both opportunities and considerations: Research Metaplanet’s Fundamentals: Beyond the news, delve into Metaplanet’s financial health, its Bitcoin acquisition strategy, and its long-term vision. Understand its valuation relative to its Bitcoin holdings and other similar companies globally. Monitor Trading Volume: Post-July 1, observe how the trading volume and liquidity of Metaplanet shares evolve. Increased activity could signal growing investor interest. Understand Bitcoin’s Volatility: Remember that Metaplanet’s stock performance will be significantly influenced by the price movements of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is known for its volatility, and this will inherently translate to Metaplanet’s share price. Consider Your Risk Tolerance: While the TSE’s move is positive, investing in any stock, especially one tied to a volatile asset like Bitcoin, carries risk. Assess if this aligns with your personal risk tolerance and investment goals. Stay Updated on Japanese Regulations: The regulatory landscape in Japan is dynamic. Keep an eye on any further policy changes that could impact crypto-related companies or investment vehicles. This development positions Metaplanet as a key player to watch in the convergence of traditional finance and the digital asset space, particularly within the influential Japanese market. A New Horizon for Crypto in Japan? The Tokyo Stock Exchange’s decision to lift Margin Trading Limits on Metaplanet is more than just a procedural change; it’s a powerful signal of evolving attitudes towards digital assets within established financial systems. It highlights Metaplanet’s growing legitimacy and could significantly bolster Bitcoin Adoption Japan by making Bitcoin exposure more accessible through traditional investment channels. As the Japanese Crypto Market continues to mature, such moves by prominent financial institutions pave the way for greater integration and acceptance of cryptocurrencies. This is a story of innovation meeting regulation, and for investors and crypto enthusiasts alike, it marks an exciting new chapter.

The nation’s central bank governor, Timur Suleimenov, stated that the reserve could be managed by a specialized subsidiary focused on alternative investments, according to a report by the government news agency Kazinform . Kazakhstan is formulating rules that follow sovereign-wealth best practices, including a single-manager setup, transparent books, and audited, secure storage. Suleimenov asserted that a single custodian protects public assets from the market’s wild swings and security breaches. He anticipates ministries and law enforcement to finalize the framework, but shared no launch date or target size as of publication time. “The National Bank supports a prudent and institutionally sound approach to forming a state crypto reserve in accordance with the best international practices in managing sovereign funds (including sovereign crypto reserves), ensuring transparency in the accounting and custody of crypto assets, transparency in the ownership of the crypto reserve, and the sustainability of the state crypto reserve,” said Suleimenov. Acknowledging crypto’s high volatility and security risks, he emphasized that placing the reserve under the control of a centralized institution would ensure proper safekeeping and oversight. “Given the risks and volatility associated with storing crypto assets, a key factor in effectively structuring the management of a state crypto reserve is the centralized institutionalization of such management to ensure the safekeeping of crypto assets,” Suleimenov postulated. The move deepens Kazakhstan’s push into the crypto industry. The nation currently controls approximately 13% of the global Bitcoin hashrate and has disclosed plans to launch “CryptoCity” — a pioneering pilot zone where crypto assets can be used to pay for goods and services. National Crypto Reserves Gaining Popularity Worldwide Elsewhere, state-run national crypto reserves are gaining traction, although such initiatives typically only consider Bitcoin. Last week, Pradeep Bhandari, the national spokesperson for India’s ruling party, urged the nation to launch a Bitcoin reserve pilot, noting that it would be a strategic step toward economic resilience. Texas Governor Greg Abbott recently signed a bill officially authorizing the creation of the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve— a state-managed fund that will hold the premier crypto as part of the state’s long-term financial assets. Both initiatives follow President Trump’s grand proposal to create a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve , treating Bitcoin as a national reserve asset akin to digital gold",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/kazakhstan-to-create-national-crypto-reserve-using-seized-and-state-mined-coins/,"FIAT|BTC|REGULATION|MARKET|MINING","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Cryptocurrency News|Kazakhstan",cryptocompare

Strategy Expands Its Holdings With New $531M BTC Purchase According to a Monday US Securities and Exchange Commission filing , the Virginia-based software firm-turned Bitcoin treasury purchased 4,980 Bitcoin for $531.9 million at an average price of $106,801 per token between June 23 and 29. The acquisition brings Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to 597,325 BTC, now valued at approximately $64 billion, based on a current market price of around $107,328 per Bitcoin. The average purchase price of the company’s total BTC position now stands at $70,982.

The latest BTC acquisition was funded through a combination of proceeds from the STRD issuance and an at-the-market (ATM) share sale program, which included sales of its preferred stock classes, STRK and STRF. Corporate Copycats Follow Strategy’s BTC Playbook Strategy started amassing Bitcoin back in August 2020 with an initial purchase of 21,454 BTC.

2025-06-30T19:33:08,"Is Bitcoin (BTC) Currently Overpriced or Undervalued? Here’s What Analysts Think","Cryptocurrency analyst Axel Adler has provided important data on the current market position of Bitcoin. Based on the metric “Bitcoin Distribution by Realized Supply,” Adler assessed how expensive or cheap Bitcoin’s current price level is relative to the average cost of investors. According to Adler, “Realized Supply” represents the total dollar value of Bitcoins on the network, calculated based on the most recent price movement. The ratio between this metric and the Bitcoin price allows comparison of today’s price with the average cost paid by investors. This value, defined as “Ratio = Bitcoin Price / Realized Supply,” is similar to the price/earnings (P/E) ratio in stock markets. “The higher the ratio, the more expensive Bitcoin is; the lower it is, the cheaper it can be considered,” Adler said. Related News: Co-founder and CEO of This Altcoin to Join US Government's Crypto Committee According to Adler, the Bitcoin price is currently slightly above the annual average based on this ratio. This shows that the market is neither overbought nor oversold, i.e. in a neutral position. Adler recalled that a similar ratio was observed before the rise in November 2024, when Bitcoin rose from $ 74,000 to $ 107,000. Adler, who touched upon another important indicator in his analysis, the “365-Day Bitcoin Price Change” metric, stated that this rate is currently around 30%. In other words, Adler stated that Bitcoin is currently increasing in value by around 30% on an annual basis, and that if a classic macro cycle is followed, this increase could reach levels of 60-70%, at which point investors will decide whether to make a profit or not. “Once this threshold level is reached, investors will either choose to take profits or wait for the rise to continue,” Adler said, adding that a similar structure has continued since September 2023. *This is not investment advice.

Regulators say The Santa Anna National Bank has been shut down – and foul play at the small Texas lender is suspected. The FDIC has not disclosed the nature of the suspected fraud, and the agency is not sure whether customers with uninsured deposits will be reimbursed. “Once further information is available, the FDIC will consider whether to provide uninsured depositors an advance dividend (i.e. access to a portion of their uninsured funds) and will provide more information at that time… Suspected fraud contributed to the failure of the bank and estimated cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF).” The bank has reported $53.8 million in total deposits, and the FDIC says about $2.8 million of those deposits exceed its insurance limits at time of publishing. The first bank failure of 2025 happened in January, when regulators shuttered Pulaski Savings Bank in Chicago, Illinois. The FDIC Office of Inspector General later said the lender collapsed because it had $20.7 million in deposit liabilities that were unaccounted for, which left the bank critically undercapitalized.

2025-06-30T19:00:23,"XRP Golden Cross Flashes, Analyst Foresees Big Breakout","XRP has flashed a strong bullish signal that’s drawing renewed attention across the crypto market. A Golden Cross has just formed on XRP’s 2-day MACD chart, a move that crypto analyst STEPH IS CRYPTO highlighted in a recent post on X. This technical formation historically suggests the start of upward momentum, and XRP’s current price action appears to be reflecting similar conditions to a prior breakout earlier this year. As of report time, XRP is trading at $2.20 . A Closer Look at the Golden Cross The Golden Cross on the MACD occurs when the MACD line crosses above the signal line. On XRP’s 2-day chart, this crossover has just been confirmed. Importantly, this is the same signal that preceded XRP’s previous rally in April, when the asset jumped from around $1.50 to over $2.60 within a few weeks. #XRP Golden Cross! pic.twitter.com/kgmVxEFybq — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) June 30, 2025 STEPH emphasized the significance of this crossover by comparing the current MACD structure to the one observed in March. The similarities between the two periods are notable, not only in the MACD behavior but also in the price consolidation pattern that led up to the move. Historical Parallels In late March 2025, XRP’s 2-day MACD printed a Golden Cross. Within days, bullish momentum kicked in, pushing the price above major resistance zones. By early May, XRP had touched highs above $2.60. While past results are not predictive guarantees, analysts frequently look for these technical repetitions to identify high-probability trade setups. Now, XRP is showing early signs of a similar trend. The coin has been consolidating between $2.00 and $2.30, forming a stable base despite market volatility. The reappearance of the Golden Cross adds further weight to the possibility of a breakout continuation. Market Context and Sentiment The broader crypto market has also stabilized in recent weeks. Bitcoin is trading above $63,000, and Ethereum remains steady at $3,500. These conditions have created a favorable environment for altcoins like XRP to regain traction. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 In XRP’s case, recent ecosystem developments are also supporting market sentiment. The launch of the XRPL EVM sidechain has expanded XRP’s smart contract capabilities, opening doors to broader DeFi integrations. This move is seen as a major milestone in the XRPL roadmap and has attracted both developer and investor interest. Outlook: A Potential Breakout Ahead? While the Golden Cross alone doesn’t confirm a breakout, it often marks the beginning of renewed momentum. For XRP, a decisive close above $2.30 would be a strong bullish confirmation and could open the door to higher price targets, potentially retesting April’s highs. At $2.20, XRP is well-positioned technically, and momentum indicators are starting to shift in favor of the bulls. With market structure firming up and historical signals aligning, STEPH IS CRYPTO’s observation could soon play out in real-time. The coming days will be critical as traders look for volume confirmation and resistance breakouts. For now, the Golden Cross offers a powerful signal that XRP may be gearing up for its next major move. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

2025-06-30T19:00:13,"Bitcoin’s Unstoppable Rise: BTC-Gold Ratio Signals Explosive Gains","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Unstoppable Rise: BTC-Gold Ratio Signals Explosive Gains Is Bitcoin truly stepping into its role as the new digital gold ? For years, investors have debated whether the premier cryptocurrency could genuinely rival, or even surpass, the traditional safe-haven asset. Recent market movements suggest that the scales are tipping, and the answer might be a resounding ‘yes’. The latest surge in the BTC-gold ratio has sent ripples across the financial world, indicating a significant shift in investor sentiment and potential for remarkable upside for Bitcoin. Understanding the BTC-Gold Ratio : A Key Indicator The BTC-gold ratio is a powerful metric that measures Bitcoin’s value in terms of gold. Essentially, it tells you how many ounces of gold one Bitcoin can buy. This ratio isn’t just a number; it’s a barometer for risk appetite and the relative strength of two distinct assets – one a centuries-old store of value, the other a revolutionary digital innovation. When the ratio rises, it signifies that Bitcoin is outperforming gold, suggesting investors are flocking to the digital asset, perhaps seeing it as a more attractive store of value or a growth asset. Historically, gold has been the go-to asset during times of economic uncertainty, a hedge against inflation and market volatility. Bitcoin, often dubbed ‘digital gold’, shares some of these characteristics, like scarcity and resistance to censorship, but also offers unique advantages such as ease of transfer and divisibility. The recent breakout of this ratio isn’t just a statistical anomaly; it’s a strong technical signal that speaks volumes about Bitcoin’s maturing narrative. Why the Recent Bitcoin Gains Are Significant Last week, the BTC-gold ratio experienced a dramatic surge, climbing over 10% to reach 33.33. This wasn’t just any ordinary price movement; it marked its strongest weekly performance in two months. According to CoinDesk, this surge broke out from a well-defined ‘bull flag’ pattern. For those unfamiliar with technical analysis, a bull flag is a continuation pattern that appears after a strong price increase (the ‘flagpole’) followed by a period of consolidation (the ‘flag’). A breakout from this pattern typically signals that the preceding uptrend is set to resume, often with significant momentum. The implications of this breakout are profound. It suggests that the market is not just consolidating after previous Bitcoin gains , but is preparing for another leg up. The fact that Bitcoin is showing such strength relative to gold, rather than gold declining, highlights a fundamental shift in capital allocation. Investors are actively choosing Bitcoin over traditional safe havens, signaling confidence in its long-term value proposition and its ability to act as a superior inflation hedge or growth asset in the current economic climate. Navigating the Broader Cryptocurrency Market Landscape Bitcoin’s performance often sets the tone for the entire cryptocurrency market . When Bitcoin shows strong bullish signals, it typically pulls the rest of the market, including altcoins, along with it. This recent breakout in the BTC-gold ratio could therefore be a precursor to a broader rally across the crypto space. However, it’s crucial to remember that while Bitcoin’s dominance often leads, altcoins can exhibit higher volatility and different risk profiles. The overall sentiment in the cryptocurrency market is also influenced by macro-economic factors, regulatory developments, and institutional adoption. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, and increasing mainstream acceptance continue to build a robust foundation for future growth. As Bitcoin solidifies its position, it attracts more traditional investors, further legitimizing the entire digital asset ecosystem. This influx of capital and growing interest contributes to a more mature and resilient market. Is Bitcoin Price Poised for Further Ascent? The technical analysis following the bull flag breakout suggests that the BTC-gold ratio could potentially head towards 42.00. If this target is met, it would imply substantial further appreciation for Bitcoin relative to gold. What does this mean for the actual Bitcoin price ? While the ratio doesn’t give an exact price target, it indicates strong underlying demand and a positive outlook. Should gold remain stable, a move to 42.00 would mean Bitcoin’s dollar value would rise significantly. Several factors could contribute to this continued ascent: Scarcity: Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins makes it inherently deflationary, a stark contrast to fiat currencies. Halving Events: The periodic halving of mining rewards reduces the rate of new Bitcoin entering circulation, historically leading to price increases. Institutional Adoption: More large institutions, corporations, and even sovereign wealth funds are adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Network Effects: The growing number of users, developers, and applications built on Bitcoin’s blockchain strengthens its utility and value. While volatility remains a characteristic of the crypto market, the long-term trends and fundamental drivers point towards a sustained upward trajectory for Bitcoin. The Future of Digital Gold : Bitcoin’s Dominance The debate over Bitcoin’s status as ‘ digital gold ‘ has evolved from a speculative idea to a widely accepted investment thesis. Bitcoin offers several compelling advantages over traditional gold in the modern era: Portability: Billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin can be stored on a small USB drive or even memorized, unlike physical gold which is cumbersome to transport. Divisibility: Bitcoin can be divided into 100 million satoshis, making it highly granular for transactions of any size. Verifiability: The blockchain ensures transparency and prevents counterfeiting, a challenge for physical gold. Decentralization: No single entity controls Bitcoin, making it resistant to seizure or censorship by governments. While gold has thousands of years of history as a store of value, Bitcoin is rapidly catching up, proving its resilience and growing appeal, especially among younger generations and tech-savvy investors. The ongoing shift in the BTC-gold ratio underscores this growing dominance, positioning Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a legitimate and potentially superior alternative to traditional wealth preservation tools. Actionable Insights for Investors For investors watching these trends, the breakout of the BTC-gold ratio offers valuable insights: Consider Diversification: While Bitcoin shows strength, a diversified portfolio across various asset classes remains prudent. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on key technical indicators like the BTC-gold ratio, as well as broader market news and regulatory developments. Long-Term Perspective: Bitcoin’s journey is still relatively young. A long-term investment horizon often helps weather short-term volatility. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose, and understand the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrency. Concluding Thoughts: Bitcoin’s Ascendant Path The recent surge in the BTC-gold ratio is more than just a fleeting market event; it’s a powerful affirmation of Bitcoin’s growing stature in the global financial landscape. The breakout from a bull flag pattern, pushing the ratio to 33.33, signals robust demand and a strong technical foundation for further appreciation. As Bitcoin continues to prove its resilience and utility as a store of value and a transactional currency, its narrative as the ultimate digital gold strengthens. While the road ahead may have its ups and downs, the current momentum suggests that Bitcoin is on an unstoppable path, ready to deliver explosive gains and redefine the future of finance.

2025-06-30T19:00:00,"Bitcoin Dominance Shows Bearish Divergence – Altseason Could Be Near","Bitcoin briefly pushed into the $108,800 level a few hours ago but was once again unable to reclaim higher prices, reinforcing the key resistance just below its all-time high. This rejection has left the market in a state of caution, with investors expecting increased volatility in the coming sessions. As BTC continues to hover below the $109,300 mark, traders are watching closely for signs of either a confirmed breakout or a potential pullback. Related Reading: Bitcoin Struggles Below ATH After Weeks Of Failed Attempts – $109K Level In Focus Adding a new layer to the current setup, top analyst Ted Pillows shared a notable development in Bitcoin dominance. According to Pillows, the Bitcoin Dominance chart is now showing a daily bearish divergence—a classic signal that often precedes a shift in momentum from Bitcoin to altcoins. This divergence occurs when BTC dominance trends higher while momentum indicators begin to weaken, suggesting that Bitcoin’s relative strength may be peaking. For altcoin investors, this could be an early signal of a shift. Historically, bearish divergences in dominance have lead to strong altcoin rallies, as capital begins flowing from BTC into higher-beta assets. While Bitcoin consolidates near resistance, attention may soon shift toward altcoins, setting the stage for a possible altseason. Bitcoin Consolidates As Charts Signal Altcoin Rotation Following the resolution of global tensions between the US, Israel, and Iran, Bitcoin surged above the $105,000 level, signaling renewed confidence across global risk markets. The move marked a key recovery from previous uncertainty, with BTC taking back critical support and shifting focus back toward the $110,000 resistance zone. However, despite the initial breakout, Bitcoin has struggled to push into uncharted territory. Price action remains choppy and directionless, with the market hesitating ahead of what many believe could be a decisive move. Analysts continue to call for a breakout, citing strong accumulation trends, improving macroeconomic conditions, and a bullish long-term structure. Yet the inability to break above the $109,300–$110,000 range raises concerns about weakening momentum. The longer Bitcoin remains capped below resistance, the more likely it is that capital may begin to rotate into other parts of the market. Top analyst Ted Pillows recently shared key insights supporting that thesis. According to Pillows, Bitcoin dominance is showing a daily bearish divergence—a classic sign of impending trend reversal. As BTC dominance climbs but momentum weakens, it suggests that Bitcoin’s recent strength may be fading, and a shift toward altcoins could be underway. Historically, bearish divergences in BTC dominance have often preceded sharp corrections in Bitcoin and explosive rallies across the altcoin market. As Bitcoin consolidates and its dominance loses strength, conditions may be forming for the next big altseason. While nothing is guaranteed, the combination of geopolitical relief, market indecision, and technical signals suggests that a sharp rotation could be close. Traders are now watching both BTC price and dominance levels closely, knowing that once momentum shifts, the move could be swift and powerful. Related Reading: Ethereum Sees $269M In Net Inflows In 24H – Bullish Momentum Accelerates ETH/BTC Chart Shows Signs Of Reversal The ETH/BTC weekly chart reveals a prolonged downtrend that has persisted since late 2022, with Ethereum consistently underperforming against Bitcoin. Since peaking above 0.085 BTC in late 2022, the pair has steadily declined, now trading around 0.0228 BTC—a level not seen since 2020. This confirms that Bitcoin has been the clear market leader for nearly two years, adding most of the capital inflow during bullish phases while altcoins, including Ethereum, lagged behind. However, current price action shows early signs that this trend may be nearing its end. ETH/BTC appears to have found a local bottom, just above the 0.02 BTC zone, after a steep drop. Although the pair remains well below the 50 (weekly), 100, and 200 moving averages, the selling momentum has clearly slowed, and volume has begun to stabilize. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Critical Long-Term Channel – Next Move Could Be Parabolic This phase suggests that a swing could be forming. If Ethereum can reclaim higher support levels and Bitcoin dominance continues to show bearish divergence—as noted in recent market analyses—the ETH/BTC ratio could start trending higher once again. A rotation from Bitcoin into Ethereum and other altcoins may soon follow, potentially marking the beginning of a new phase in the crypto cycle where altcoins start to outperform.

2025-06-30T18:59:16,"Why is Bitcoin having such a hard time in blowing past $110,000?","Despite a year of significant bullish momentum, Bitcoin has repeatedly failed to break through the psychologically and technically significant $110,000 barrier, at least sustainably. After reaching an all-time high of $111,700 in May, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap has been stuck in a tight range between $103,000 and $108,000. This has puzzled investors, especially given the backdrop of institutional adoption, record inflows (ETFs), and favourable macro conditions. More importantly, Michael Bucella, the managing partner of Neoclassical Capital, expects BTC to remain stuck in this range for a while. At the time of writing, the crypto king is going for a little under $108,000. Why is Bitcoin keeping within a tight range? Speaking recently with CNBC , Bucella referenced initiatives from the likes of 21 Capital, Tether, and Pro Cap that are raising billions of dollars through Bitcoin Treasury products. The market veteran also acknowledged that “ETF inflows have been enormous – $4 billion in June alone.” However, BTC price action has, nonetheless, remained muted. One reason is risk substitution. As Bucella explained, “Some investors are replacing Bitcoin spot risk with proxies like Coinbase, Circle, or Bitcoin treasury companies.” These firms, buoyed by the stablecoin boom and AI-adjacent narratives, have become alternative vehicles for crypto exposure, siphoning off capital that might otherwise flow directly into BTC. What BTC technicals are pointing to at the moment From a technical standpoint, Bitcoin is showing signs of fatigue . Experts point to wedge formation on the hourly chart, with repeated rejections just below $110,000. According to Coinotag, short interest is rising, and open interest is declining – classic signals of a potential soft reversal. The $106,000 level has emerged as a critical support zone; a break below it could trigger a deeper correction. Adding to the pressure are Bitcoin miners. Many are operating on razor-thin margins and have begun liquidating holdings to stay afloat. “If you don’t have top-tier assets or AI contracts to pivot to, you’re running loss-making models,” Bucella said. This miner-driven supply is quietly weighing on the market, even as demand remains robust. Meanwhile, whale activity has declined as well. Data from CoinEngineer shows a 57% decline in whale volume over a recent two-day span, coinciding with BTC’s failure to breach $110,000. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has also cooled from overbought levels, suggesting waning momentum. What else is standing in the way of Bitcoin in 2025? Bitcoin’s identity crisis may also be contributing to its stalled ascent. During geopolitical flare-ups, such as the recent Israel-Iran tensions , Bitcoin sold off rather than acting as a safe haven. “If it’s not going to behave like digital gold, then why not just own the S&P 500?” the CNBC host asked pointedly. Bucella responded that Bitcoin’s correlation depends on the timeframe and context. “It continues to be a great beneficiary of global currencies cratering,” he said, pointing to the surge in demand from sovereign and institutional treasuries. Still, for Bitcoin to decisively break above $110,000 , it may need more than macro tailwinds and ETF flows. It needs a narrative reset – one that reaffirms its role as both a hard asset and a growth vehicle. Until then, the $110K ceiling remains a stubborn test of conviction.

2025-06-30T18:56:33,"Why 2025 May Be the Year Crypto Finally ‘Grew Up’ in the Eyes of Wall Street","The year 2025 may well be remembered as the point where digital assets crossed a long-awaited threshold from speculative fringe to institutional mainstay. While crypto markets have seen waves of hype, collapse, and cautious optimism over the past decade, recent developments suggest the narrative is no longer about “if” institutions are coming, but “how fast.” From billion-dollar ETF inflows and public company accumulation to regulatory milestones and integration by traditional financial giants, crypto is experiencing an institutional maturation at a scale and pace that’s forcing even the most skeptical Wall Street veterans to take notice. ETF Inflows Signal Institutional Acceleration It began with numbers that were hard to ignore. Over an 11-day period in June, Bitcoin ETFs attracted $2.2 billion in inflows, marking the longest winning streak since their U.S. launch in January. Market leaders like BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund pulled in hundreds of millions in daily flows—an unmistakable sign that money managers were back in the market. Source: CoinShares report These aren’t retail-driven FOMO surges. Rather, they reflect pension funds, RIAs, and institutional allocators quietly but assertively expanding their crypto exposure as part of diversified portfolios. Metaplanet Joins the Big Leagues Beyond ETFs, corporations are also signaling intent through direct purchases. Japan’s Metaplanet made headlines this month by buying another 1,005 BTC , bringing its total to 13,350—enough to push it into the top five corporate Bitcoin holders globally, surpassing Tesla and Galaxy Digital. What’s more telling is how they’re financing it. Metaplanet issued traditional bonds to raise funds for their crypto play, reflecting a bridging of conventional capital markets with the decentralized world. The move was rewarded: Metaplanet’s stock surged 10% on the announcement, showing that equity investors, too, are warming to crypto-linked exposure. Legacy Finance Firms Are Getting Hands-On In parallel, some of the world’s most established financial players are actively building inroads into crypto infrastructure: Mastercard has teamed up with Fiserv to integrate a stablecoin (FIUSD) into its global payments ecosystem. The goal: make stablecoin spending as seamless as swiping a card—at over 150 million merchants. JPMorgan has launched JPMD , a deposit token that represents U.S. dollars on a blockchain. This isn’t a proof of concept—it’s already in limited use among institutional clients conducting cross-border settlements. Standard Chartered struck a partnership with FalconX to offer digital asset settlement services to hedge funds and sovereign wealth clients. This extends crypto’s reach deeper into the world of high-frequency, institutional-grade trading. The Market Responds As of June 30, Bitcoin trades around $107,800, rebounding from recent lows of $98,000. Ethereum has regained its $6,000 mark, and broader market sentiment is neutral to bullish. Analysts at Galaxy and Bernstein suggest that should ETF inflows continue at current pace, Bitcoin could test the $120,000 level before Q4. In essence, 2025 may not be remembered for fireworks but for foundations. The explosive rallies and brutal crashes of prior years are being replaced by something subtler and, perhaps, more powerful: institutional consistency.

During an interview on Bloomberg’s The Close, Dan Ives says the stocks of the technology titans Nvidia and Microsoft will provide significant returns later this year as artificial intelligence (AI) continues to gain momentum. “This is just starting in terms of this next stage of the AI revolution. I think as we go into the software phase, you see on the consumer side, when it comes to AI, I believe this is still the bottom of the first, top of the second inning. That’s why Nvidia, $4 trillion, ultimately [will be] $5 trillion. Microsoft, we think is on the road to $4 trillion and then $5 trillion. It’s our view that this tech bull market… Get the popcorn out, I think it’s going to be a very strong second half.” He also shares his thoughts on Uber amid reports that the transportation service company is negotiating with its former CEO, Travis Kalanick, to potentially fund the acquisition of the US arm of the Chinese autonomous vehicle company Pony AI. “When you look at the next phase, when it comes to physical AI, it’s about autonomous and Uber… Uber needs to definitely focus on partnerships and expanding their repertoire when it comes to autonomous. This would be a smart, strategic move, aggressive if they did it.” Ives says he is generally optimistic about the tech sector, including older companies like IBM. “I think that’s going to be the next chapter when it comes to AI, but it speaks broadly to our view of tech, from robotics to autonomous to enterprise to consumer AI. Across the board, I mean, this is, I believe, a golden age for tech.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-30T18:41:30,"Morgan Stanley Predicts S&P 500 Rally, Says Three Catalysts To Drive Next Leg Up: Report","Morgan Stanley chief investment officer Mike Wilson is reportedly predicting that US stocks are not done rallying in 2025. Wilson says in a note to investors that the S&P 500 will likely continue putting up gains for the remainder of the year, reports Investing.com. He believes that the Federal Reserve will cut rates, adding liquidity to the market, and company earnings will exceed expectations, sending stocks higher. “Equity markets have been resilient since bottoming in April, and the rally has been more fundamentally driven than many appreciate… We remain bullish on a six-to-12-month horizon as EPS (earnings per share) tailwinds expand, and the market has line of sight to Fed cuts.” Wilson says a third catalyst behind a likely continued stock market rally is the decline in broader policy and geopolitical risks. One metric Wilson uses to predict a bullish market is the earnings revisions breadth, or the proportion of analysts who have raised their estimates minus the proportion who have lowered them. The earnings revisions breadth has increased from a low of -25% in April to -5% currently, providing “fundamental justification” for equity growth, Wilson says. He adds that similar changes in the past have resulted in stronger earnings. “This series leads EPS surprise.” Wilson also says that stocks will likely trade higher ahead of expected Fed rate cuts later this year.

2025-06-30T18:41:13,"Coinsilium Bitcoin: Strategic Boost Unveils Massive 73 BTC Holdings","BitcoinWorld Coinsilium Bitcoin: Strategic Boost Unveils Massive 73 BTC Holdings The world of digital assets is constantly evolving, and a significant move by a prominent player often signals deeper trends within the market. Recently, the Web3 investment and advisory firm, Coinsilium, made headlines with a strategic expansion of its Bitcoin reserves. This isn’t just a minor acquisition; it’s a bold statement, as the company announced via X (formerly Twitter) that it acquired an additional 15.4147 BTC, elevating its total Coinsilium Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 73.7304 BTC. What drives such a decision, and what does it tell us about the broader landscape of institutional engagement with cryptocurrencies? Understanding Coinsilium’s Strategic Bitcoin Holdings Expansion Coinsilium is not new to the Web3 space. As an investment and advisory firm, it has been at the forefront of identifying and supporting innovative projects within the decentralized ecosystem. Their latest move to significantly increase their Bitcoin holdings underscores a growing confidence not just in Bitcoin itself, but in the long-term viability and potential of the entire digital asset market. This isn’t merely about holding a digital asset; it’s about a calculated treasury management strategy. Let’s break down the significance of this acquisition: Increased Exposure: By adding over 15 BTC, Coinsilium substantially increases its direct exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements, signaling a bullish outlook on the leading cryptocurrency. Treasury Management: For a Web3 firm, holding a significant portion of its reserves in Bitcoin can be seen as a hedge against inflation and a strategic allocation of capital that aligns with their core business ethos. Market Confidence: Such an announcement from a publicly active firm can instill confidence among investors, highlighting Bitcoin’s role as a legitimate store of value and a viable asset class for corporate treasuries. Why Are Companies Increasing Their Bitcoin Holdings? Coinsilium’s move is part of a larger trend observed among various corporations, both within and outside the crypto native space. The motivations behind accumulating substantial Bitcoin holdings are multifaceted, often driven by macroeconomic factors, a search for alternative stores of value, and the recognition of Bitcoin’s unique properties. Here are some key reasons why companies are bolstering their Bitcoin reserves: Reason Explanation Inflation Hedge In an era of quantitative easing and rising inflation concerns, Bitcoin’s fixed supply (21 million coins) makes it an attractive asset to preserve purchasing power, often referred to as ‘digital gold’. Diversification Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury or investment portfolio can offer diversification away from traditional assets like fiat currencies, bonds, and equities, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Growth Potential Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has demonstrated significant long-term growth potential, making it an appealing asset for companies looking to grow their capital reserves. Technological Alignment For Web3 and tech-forward companies, holding Bitcoin aligns with their vision of a decentralized, digitally-native future. It demonstrates a commitment to the ecosystem they operate within. First-Mover Advantage Early adopters believe they can gain a competitive edge by familiarizing themselves with digital assets and blockchain technology before mainstream adoption fully takes hold. Companies like MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, have famously adopted a Bitcoin-centric treasury strategy, accumulating vast amounts of BTC. While not every company will follow such an aggressive approach, Coinsilium’s actions indicate a growing comfort level and strategic consideration of Bitcoin as a core treasury asset. The Role of Web3 Investment Firms in Crypto Adoption Web3 investment firms like Coinsilium play a pivotal role in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the nascent, yet rapidly expanding, decentralized web. Their expertise lies not just in capital allocation, but also in understanding the intricate technological and market dynamics of blockchain, NFTs, DeFi, and other Web3 innovations. Their contributions to crypto adoption extend beyond just investing their own capital: Incubating Innovation: They often provide early-stage funding and mentorship to promising Web3 startups, helping them navigate the complex regulatory and technical landscapes. Advisory Services: Many offer strategic advice to enterprises looking to integrate blockchain technology or enter the crypto space, helping to de-risk and streamline their entry. Market Validation: When a respected Web3 firm makes a significant investment in a core asset like Bitcoin, it sends a strong signal of validation to the broader market, encouraging other institutions to consider similar moves. Ecosystem Building: By participating actively in governance, development, and community initiatives, they contribute to the overall health and growth of the Web3 ecosystem. Coinsilium’s increased Bitcoin allocation can also be seen as a demonstration of their belief in the foundational layer of the entire Web3 stack. Bitcoin, as the original decentralized network, underpins much of the philosophical and technological innovation seen in Web3. What Does This Mean for Institutional Crypto Adoption? The consistent increase in corporate and institutional Bitcoin holdings , exemplified by Coinsilium, is a strong indicator of maturing interest and confidence in the digital asset space. For years, Bitcoin was largely a retail phenomenon, but that narrative is rapidly shifting. The path to widespread institutional crypto adoption is paved by several factors: Regulatory Clarity: As more jurisdictions develop clearer frameworks for digital assets, institutions feel more secure in their investments. Improved Infrastructure: The development of robust custody solutions, regulated exchanges, and derivatives markets makes it easier and safer for large entities to engage with crypto. Performance Track Record: Despite volatility, Bitcoin’s long-term performance has caught the attention of traditional finance, prompting a re-evaluation of its role in diversified portfolios. Peer Influence: As more prominent firms like Coinsilium, MicroStrategy, and even asset managers like BlackRock (with their spot Bitcoin ETF) enter the space, it creates a domino effect, encouraging others not to be left behind. Coinsilium’s move, while specific to their treasury, contributes to the growing narrative that Bitcoin is not just a speculative asset but a legitimate component of a forward-thinking institutional investment strategy. It helps normalize the idea of holding significant crypto assets on a balance sheet. Crafting a Robust Crypto Portfolio Strategy Whether you’re an individual investor or a corporate entity, Coinsilium’s strategic move offers valuable lessons on approaching a crypto portfolio strategy . It highlights the importance of conviction, long-term vision, and understanding the underlying assets. Here are some actionable insights for developing your own crypto investment approach: Define Your Objectives: Are you looking for long-term capital appreciation, diversification, or short-term gains? Your goals will dictate your asset allocation. Understand the Assets: Don’t just buy what’s popular. Research Bitcoin’s fundamentals, its scarcity, network effects, and its role in the broader crypto ecosystem. Understand the difference between Bitcoin and altcoins. Start with Core Holdings: Many strategists suggest a foundation in Bitcoin and Ethereum, given their market dominance and network security, before exploring more volatile altcoins. Diversify Wisely: While Bitcoin is a strong foundation, a diversified portfolio might include exposure to different sectors within Web3, such as DeFi, NFTs, or specific Layer 1/Layer 2 solutions, depending on your risk tolerance. Risk Management is Key: Crypto markets are volatile. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Consider dollar-cost averaging to mitigate price fluctuations. Secure Your Assets: Prioritize security. Use hardware wallets for significant holdings and practice strong password hygiene. Stay Informed: The crypto space evolves rapidly. Keep up with news, regulatory changes, and technological advancements. Coinsilium’s decision to increase its Bitcoin allocation is a testament to a well-thought-out strategy that likely balances potential returns with a long-term outlook on digital assets. It’s not about chasing short-term pumps, but about building a resilient and future-proof treasury. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards a Decentralized Future Coinsilium’s substantial increase in its Bitcoin holdings to over 73 BTC is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a powerful affirmation of Bitcoin’s enduring value and the growing confidence among sophisticated Web3 firms. This strategic move not only strengthens Coinsilium’s own financial position but also contributes significantly to the broader narrative of institutional crypto adoption . It serves as a compelling example for other corporations considering their entry into the digital asset space, highlighting Bitcoin’s role as a robust and strategic treasury asset in an increasingly digital world. As the Web3 landscape continues to mature, we can expect more such decisive actions from pioneering firms, further cementing cryptocurrencies as an integral part of the global financial future.

2025-06-30T18:30:24,"Dogecoin Positioning For A Run To New Thresholds As Key Chart Pattern Takes Shape","The ongoing volatility in the market appears to have stifled Dogecoin’s upward movement as the dog-themed meme coin remains within the $0.16 threshold. It is important to note that DOGE has been falling since reaching a yearly high of $0.48. However, with recent technical setups, the meme coin could be set for a rebound that is likely to push prices to a new landmark . Key Setup Points To A Massive Rally For Dogecoin Over the past few months, Dogecoin ’s performance has been quite bearish after witnessing a notable pullback. This persistent downward action might be coming to an end as a compelling chart formation emerges, hinting at a potential major rally to higher levels. Dogecoin is once again capturing market attention with the emergence of a crucial Falling Wedge formation, as outlined by Trader Tardigrade, a technical expert and investor. Following a period of indecisive trading and slight declines, the technical signal is lining up in support of DOGE, suggesting a possible breakout. A falling wedge formation is a technical pattern that unfolds during a downward trend, which points to a possible shift in the trend toward the upside again . The emergence of the key chart pattern indicates that the ongoing bearish action of Dogecoin is approaching its end. According to the expert, Dogecoin has been forming falling wedges repeatedly on support levels. In a 2-year period, DOGE has formed a total of three falling wedge patterns on support levels, which preceded significant price spikes in the following months. The first pattern was observed between July and September 2023, and DOGE witnessed a sharp rally. Again in 2024, particularly between March and September, this pattern appeared, triggering a major surge in DOGE’s price to its current yearly high of $0.48. Meanwhile, in 2025, this structure has re-emerged, and it appears to be bigger this time than the past setups. Considering past scenarios and results , Trader Tardigrade is confident that DOGE could experience a massive upward move beyond the $0.95 level once it breaks out of the structure. DOGE Gearing Up For A Trend Reversal Dogecoin may be struggling to undergo another major rally, but current price action shows that the meme coin is building up momentum beneath the downward trend. AlienOvicho, a technical analyst and trader, revealed that a DOGE reversal is in motion, suggesting that a rally is underway. The analyst has highlighted a descending trend line in the 1-hour time frame chart, and DOGE is currently cracking through this line. Its breakout from the trend line hints at a potential larger-degree bounce toward the May high. Looking at the chart, AlienOvicho expects the meme coin to surge to the $0.20 level. Even though there isn’t a bullish framework that has been confirmed yet, the expert stated that the foundation is being built little by little.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-run-to-new-thresholds/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","Dogecoin|AlienOvicho|Descending Trend Line|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Falling Wedge Pattern|Trader Tardigrade",cryptocompare
2025-06-30T18:30:00,"Crypto News Today: Metaplanet Overtakes Tesla in Bitcoin (BTC) Holdings While Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Dominates in Retail Demand","In the current crypto market, a new crypto coin is capturing outsized attention, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . While Metaplanet is making headlines by surpassing Tesla in Bitcoin (BTC) holdings, Mutuum Finance is dominating retail investor demand, a signal that it might just be the next big crypto to watch. The token sits at phase 5 of presale for $0.03. Having already smashed through more than $11.3 million raised and indicating more than 12,600 investors, Mutuum Finance is showing strong momentum. As the crypto fear and greed index flirts with neutrality and macro trends keep traders guessing, investors are wondering what’s the best crypto to buy during this pivotal moment. Judging by recent crypto investing trends and social sentiment, Mutuum Finance could be the next crypto to explode. Metaplanet Overtakes Tesla as Major Bitcoin Holder Metaplanet, the Japanese hotelier turned crypto treasury operation, recently purchased 1,234 BTC at an average price around $108,000 per coin, bringing its total holdings to 12,345 BTC, surpassing Tesla’s reported 11,509 BTC reserve. With Bitcoin hovering around $107,400 today, Metaplanet’s stash is valued at over $1.33 billion, placing it as the fifth-largest corporate holder globally. The firm is also preparing a bold “555 Million Plan,” aiming to accumulate more than 200,000 BTC by 2027. Amid this institutional shift in Bitcoin strategy, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to see growing attention across retail markets. Mutuum Finance Presale Tops $11.3M Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has reached above 12,600 investors in a presale that exceeds more than $11.3 million.

The reward is split into four categories critical, major, minor, and low, so it will be guaranteed that all levels of vulnerability will have its reward. This is another step that proves Mutuum Finance has an active attitude to safety and its commitment to the creation of a reliable financial environment. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is surging in demand, raising over $11.3 million and onboarding 12,600+ investors as its presale nears a price jump.

The Aptos co-founder and CEO has been appointed to the CFTC’s digital asset panel, signaling a new era where those who build the infrastructure help shape its regulation. On June 30, Aptos Labs announced that its co-founder and CEO, Avery Ching, was appointed to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s Digital Asset Markets Subcommittee. • @wyostable has placed Aptos as the highest-scoring blockchain candidate for WYST—the first fiat-backed stablecoin issued by a U.S. State. • @BitwiseInvest recently filed an amendment to the Aptos ETF, moving one step closer toward the offering of an ETF linked to Aptos in the… — Aptos (@Aptos) June 30, 2025 The group, part of the CFTC’s Global Markets Advisory Committee, includes heavyweights from BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, and Citadel, alongside key crypto industry figures like Polygon Labs’ Rebecca Rettig and CoinFund’s Christopher Perkins. According to Aptos, Ching will represent the builder’s perspective in a policy environment still largely shaped by legal and financial incumbents. His appointment suggests that the CFTC is actively seeking input from technologists who understand blockchain’s complexities, not just financial institutions adapting to its disruption. Why Ching’s CFTC role could reshape crypto’s regulatory playbook Avery Ching’s appointment comes at a pivotal moment for crypto regulation. While the SEC keeps swinging its enforcement hammer, the CFTC has been playing a different game. The commodities regulator has steadily expanded its crypto oversight with a lighter touch, especially when it comes to assets like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ). With Ching now advising its Digital Asset Markets Subcommittee, the agency gains direct access to a technologist who has built blockchain infrastructure at scale. Ching’s background sets him apart from traditional finance appointees. Before co-founding Aptos, he was a principal engineer at Meta’s Diem project (formerly Libra), where he grappled with the regulatory hurdles of launching a global stablecoin. That experience gives him rare insight into both the technical and compliance challenges facing decentralized systems. On the CFTC subcommittee, Ching will work alongside figures like Nasdaq’s Tony Sio and Franklin Templeton’s Sandy Kaul, bridging the gap between crypto’s disruptors and Wall Street’s established players. Aptos’ quiet regulatory wins While Ching’s appointment is new, Aptos has been laying groundwork for regulatory relevance. The project was recently named the top blockchain candidate for Wyoming’s WYST, the first fiat-backed stablecoin issued by a U.S. state. At the same time, Bitwise’s amended filing for an Aptos-linked ETF signals growing institutional interest, even as the SEC delays decisions on broader crypto ETFs. This is not to mention that the Layer 1 blockchain already hosts three USD-pegged stablecoins, a factor that likely caught regulators’ attention given ongoing debates about stablecoin oversight. Ching’s first test may be the subcommittee’s work on stablecoin and CBDC frameworks, which it began standardizing in March 2024. With Wyoming’s WYST initiative and Aptos’ ETF prospects, his input could directly influence how regulators treat blockchain-native financial instruments.",crypto_news,https://crypto.news/aptos-founder-joins-blackrock-goldman-sachs-in-shaping-cftc-cryptos-rulebook/,"APT|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|BTC","News|Aptos|CFTC|Regulation",cryptocompare

Ethereum (ETH) deposits to Binance have continued for five consecutive days.

Trump urged Congress to pass the bill before July 4, and framed it as a marker of American economic resilience. If enacted, these measures could inject additional disposable income into households, potentially lifting short-term consumer spending. However, Elon Musk expressed concern the following day, and even warned that unfunded tax cuts risk worsening the federal budget deficit. CryptoQuant analyst noted that while short-term economic activity may rise, the long-term risks of increasing deficits could push the US toward unsustainable debt levels and higher interest obligations. Investor sentiment remains influenced by broader geopolitical tensions across global markets. Traders are monitoring whether increased retail buying alongside macroeconomic developments could point to an approaching crypto market top or drive a rotation into defensive allocations, including stablecoins, government bonds, and perceived safe-haven assets. Bitcoin’s Quiet Push Higher Amid these signals of retail-driven momentum and macroeconomic uncertainty, Matrixport offers a different lens on Bitcoin’s quiet positioning near resistance levels. The leading crypto asset has been observed to be “quietly” testing resistance levels even as US equities reach new all-time highs and ETF inflows remain strong. Despite these supportive conditions, Bitcoin’s upside volatility has stayed muted, a pattern often seen during the summer months when markets consolidate. However, expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve are building, and traders are increasingly anticipating rate cuts as policymakers debate the longer-term effects of tariff-driven inflation. As per the report, traders may begin to look beyond the stop-start nature of tariff negotiations and follow equities, where robust retail buying has fueled record highs. Matrixport reiterated its stance that spillover from Wall Street, particularly through Bitcoin ETFs, could become a critical factor for Bitcoin’s next upward move. Meanwhile, the US dollar index (DXY) has dropped nearly 12% this year, which happens to be its worst showing in 40 years, amid Fed rate-cut expectations and rising debt concerns. Analysts suggest this weakening dollar could drive Bitcoin higher, echoing past cycles where the crypto asset surged during periods of significant dollar devaluation.

According to a Robinhood announcement , the retail trading app has launched US stock and exchange-traded fund (ETF) tokens in the EU. The stock tokens will be issued on the Ethereum ( ETH ) layer-2 blockchain Arbitrum ( ARB ). Robinhood also announced plans to build its proprietary layer-2 on Arbitrum. Says GM and SVP of Robinhood Crypto Johann Kerbra, “Crypto was built by engineers for engineers, and has not been accessible to most people. We’re onboarding the world to crypto by making it as easy to use as possible—with the goal of bringing powerful tools into one intuitive platform.” In addition, the trading app giant is introducing perpetual crypto futures in the EU, as well as crypto staking in both the EU and the US. Comments Robinhood Chairman and CEO Vlad Tenev, “Our latest offerings lay the groundwork for crypto to become the backbone of the global financial system.” Last week, Robinhood announced it was rolling out micro-futures for Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other top crypto assets. In a podcast interview last year, Tenev said that Robinhood has ambitions to play a role in the merging of AI and wealth management. “I think there’s two big technology trends that could affect financial services. One is crypto, the other is AI. And Robinhood will be a leader in both. I mean we’re already a leader in crypto, and we’re making lots and lots of investments to make sure we’re the leader in AI. I don’t think the competition is particularly formidable, but I also think that’s not an excuse to get complacent, so yes, I do think we’re going to be doing a lot. And we also, just recently, announced an acquisition of Pluto, which – it’s basically an AI-based investment research product, so you can put in information about companies and investments.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Stepn/USDT 4-hour price chart: Bearish dominance surges around EMA trendlines The 4-hour Stepn price chart suggests GMT continues to experience bearish activity near EMA lines, creating a negative sentiment on the price chart.

GMT price chart If bulls cannot initiate a surge, Stepn price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.0407, resulting in a correction to $0.0374. Is Stepn A Good Investment? It’s difficult to predict the future of the GMT token, which has recently rebounded from a low point, but it’s uncertain how long this recovery will last or how far it will go. While StepN offers a valuable service, it hasn’t fully gained traction within the broader crypto community, and it remains to be seen how the platform will captivate a larger audience. As with any crypto investment, it’s crucial to conduct thorough research before making a decision to invest in GMT. Why is the GMT Price Up Today? Following Bitcoin’s surge toward the $108K level, GMT gained its momentum, resulting in a surge toward $0.044. Will GMT Price Reach $100? GMT price might soon reach the $100 mark in 2040 if the buying demand continues to surge and Stepn attracts altcoin investors. Will GMT Price Reach $1000? Due to the effort of the community, Stepn Coin’s prices will continue to increase. However, there is currently no indication that the Stepn (GMT) Coin will reach $1000 in the near future, which is a long-term target. Is GMT a Good Long-Term Investment? GMT has gained popularity thanks to strong community support. However, it’s crucial to conduct thorough research into their long-term potential to determine if it represents a viable long-term investment. Recent GMT News/Opinions STEPN developer Find Satoshi Lab has introduced its payment solution GMT Pay, which allows users to spend their web3 earnings for everyday payments. GMT Price Prediction July 2025 Over the last few days, GMT coin price has been on a downward trend and it aims to drop below crucial Fib levels. If the BTC price aims for a recovery above $110K in July, we might see a solid recovery in the GMT price. According to technical analysis, we might see the GMT price to record the maximum level of $0.064 and minimum price of $0.038, with an expected average trading price of $0.051 throughout July.

Details of the transaction indicate that the country transferred 137.245 BTC, valued at approximately $14.77 million, to the exchange on June 30, according to the latest on-chain data obtained by Finbold from Arkham Intelligence. Kingdom of Bhutan Bitcoin transaction. Source: Arkham The potential for a sale comes as the Asian nation’s Bitcoin stash has grown significantly. As of press time, Bhutan holds 11,924 BTC, valued at approximately $1.28 billion. Notably, these holdings have been built mainly through state-supported mining operations controlled by Druk Holding and Investments. Currently, there is no official explanation for the Binance deposit; however, historically, moving funds to exchanges often signals plans to sell. Impact of Bhutan’s possible Bitcoin sale Offloading a large amount could introduce short-term volatility for Bitcoin, especially as the cryptocurrency is at a critical point where it may face a correction after repeated rejections near the $110,000 level. By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $107,636. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Notably, Bhutan is among the few countries, alongside El Salvador, that have been strategically accumulating Bitcoin. On the other hand, El Salvador has made Bitcoin legal tender and follows a “no-sell” strategy of periodic buying. In contrast, most government-held Bitcoin originates from criminal seizures, with the United States holding the largest share, mainly due to the Silk Road case. Meanwhile, the Himalayan nation is working to grow its crypto ecosystem beyond mining. For example, at the recent Digital Bhutan panel co-hosted with Binance, officials outlined plans to integrate cryptocurrency into everyday life. Building on the May 2025 launch of a crypto-backed tourism payment system developed with Binance and DK Bank, the platform uses Bhutan’s Bitcoin reserves to enable over 100 cryptocurrencies to be spent fee-free at more than 1,000 merchants via Binance Pay.

On Sunday, June 29, Trump stated that he doesn’t expect he will need to extend the July 9 deadline on trade negotiations. The deadline, which Trump implemented earlier, is when the 25% tariffs on most of the U.S. trading partners kick back in. However, he did signal that the White House could do anything it wanted, either extending the deadline or even shortening it.

2025-06-30T17:36:39,"Bitcoin stalls below $108K as long term holders sell, ARB, AERO, PYTH led altcoins","Bitcoin drifted sideways during Monday’s Asian session, showing little ambition to break free from its narrow trading range as the market treaded cautiously with a hint of optimism. Across the broader crypto landscape, the total market capitalisation shed around 2.5%, with most of the pain felt in the altcoin space. Market sentiment, however, hadn’t turned sour just yet. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index remained in “Greed” territory, though it dipped two points to 66, hinting at a touch of hesitation creeping in. Why is Bitcoin price stuck? Bitcoin traded within a tight range between $106,951 and $108,771 throughout the day as long-term holders continued to exert selling pressure, effectively capping upward momentum despite a surge of institutional interest. Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards attributed the recent slowdown to long-term holders, who have been offloading their positions since the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. “People are wondering why Bitcoin has been stuck at $100K so long, despite the institutional FOMO,” he said in a Sunday X post, explaining that recent buyer inflows are being absorbed by these early holders exiting the market. According to Edwards, Bitcoin’s holder profile is shifting, as six-month holders, mainly new entrants like corporate treasuries, are gaining ground. In just two months, this group has reportedly absorbed almost all the BTC that long-term holders have been unloading for the past 18 months. Rental traders were also booking profits ahead of the July 9 tariff deadline, wary of unresolved trade issues between the US and key trading partners that could rattle global markets. The looming deadline marks the potential implementation of reciprocal tariffs, adding pressure to risk assets across equities and crypto. Further caution stemmed from the anticipation of key macroeconomic updates out of the US this week. Simultaneously, market participants are closely watching progress on developments surrounding President Trump’s proposed budget bill, which includes controversial spending cuts and tax reforms. Investors remain on edge, as any unexpected shifts in fiscal or trade policy could trigger a broader risk-off move, prompting capital to flow out of riskier assets like cryptocurrencies and into safer havens. What’s next for Bitcoin? Despite the broader dip in risk appetite, some traders remain convinced that a breakout to fresh all-time highs is only a matter of time. Bitcoin’s price has remained stuck below $108,000 since falling under that threshold on June 11, and market watchers say the key battleground lies just above. Price activity over the past 24 hours shows repeated attempts to build a base around $106,000–$107,000, with strong buy interest absorbing downside pressure. Meanwhile, significant ask-side interest continues to stack up around $109,000 and stretches as high as $113,000, suggesting a potential squeeze scenario if upward momentum returns. “Bitcoin is pushing into the $109,000 liquidity this morning as mentioned last night. The question is, will it have enough to push on through and hold?” crypto analyst AlphaBTC said in a Monday X post. As of press time, Coinglass data shows Bitcoin grinding through high-risk zones near $108,000.

Mags @thescalpingpro · Follow #Bitcoin breakout incoming.. 1:00 PM · Jun 29, 2025 1.5K Reply Copy link Read 93 replies With the neckline sitting at $112,000, a confirmed breakout above that level could set the stage for a run toward uncharted territory. Some bullish momentum may also come from the monthly and quarterly candle closes, both of which are now drawing attention. Bitcoin looks set to close June in the green, despite headline-driven volatility that kept traders on edge throughout the month. According to data from CoinGlass, BTC is on track for a 30% gain for Q2 2025, an impressive quarterly performance that many traders believe could act as a launchpad for renewed upside. A green June close, paired with a strong quarterly candle, is fuelling confidence that Bitcoin’s current consolidation is a pause rather than a local top. When writing, Bitcoin was hovering around $107,517, down 0.2% in the past day. Top altcoin gainers The altcoin market in the past 24 hours rose 2.3% to an intraday high of $1.32 trillion before ending the day 1.3% lower at $1.28 trillion. This came as the Altcoin Season Index reading fell to 19. Ethereum, the largest altcoin by market cap, dipped slightly over the day, trading at a little above $2.400 as of press time. Other large-cap altcoins like Solana (SOL), Tron (TRX), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Cardano (ADA) also recorded slight gains while XRP (XRP) remained relatively flat for the day. Arbitrum (ARB) led daily gains among the top 99 altcoins with 14.5% gains, while Aerodrome Finance (AERO) and Pyth Network (PYTH) followed with gains of 6.1% and 5% respectively. Source: CoinMarketCap ARB’s price shot up today as rumors of a potential partnership with popular retail trading platform Robinhood saw renewed momentum on news that a key official from Offchain Labs, the team behind Arbitrum, would join Robinhood’s crypto GM at a panel during an event hosted by Robinhood Europe in Cannes. Traders are likely expecting the project to confirm the partnership. Meanwhile, AERO rallied after the Aerodome developers teased a major announcement set to be unveiled later this week. As for PYTH, today’s gains were triggered after Keyring Network, in collaboration with Euler Finance, Multipli, and Pyth Network, announced the launch of zkVerified markets on Avalanche. Traders responded positively to the development, viewing it as a major step toward bridging institutional capital with DeFi in a privacy-preserving way. With Pyth supplying real-time price feeds for the new markets, demand for its oracle services is expected to rise.

2025-06-30T17:30:32,"Bitcoin Price At $145,000 In September? Bullish Dojis Suggest Upward Move","Crypto analyst Stockmoney Lizards has provided an update on the current Bitcoin price action, predicting that the flagship crypto could reach as high $145,000 later this year. The analyst alluded to a doji pattern, which supports this bullish prediction. Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price Rally To $145,000 In an X post, Stockmoney Lizards stated that his mid-term target for the Bitcoin price is between $135,000 and $145,000. He expects BTC to reach these targets between September and October later this year. The analyst also touched on the current price action and why he believes the flagship crypto will reach such lofty heights. Related Reading: Extended Wave 5 Scenario Puts Bitcoin Price Above $300,000 With Step-Like Structure In Place Stockmoney noted that the Bitcoin price is trading at the upper level of the corrective channel, forming some dojis at this level. He admitted that he doesn’t know how many bounces market participants will see from BTC and what levels the crypto will test. He raised the possibility that the local bottom may be in and also that BTC could retest the $90,000 to $94,000 range. The analyst stated that if he had to bet, he would probably predict that the Bitcoin price taps the high of the $90,000 range again. BTC had dropped to as low as $98,000 last week amid the escalated tensions between Israel and Iran. Bitcoin has since recovered following the ceasefire between both countries. Stockmoney affirmed that the latest Bitcoin price action is a bullish formation as the flagship crypto has had an impulsive move up. He added that the current price action is not the usual money rotation with old traders selling and new traders loading up at range lows. The analyst also indicated that BTC’s rally isn’t driven by the derivatives market either. BTC To At Least Reach $135,000 Crypto analyst Titan of Crypto has echoed Stockmoney’s prediction that the Bitcoin price could at least reach $135,000. In an X post, the analyst declared that BTC’s path to this price target remains intact. He stated that Bitcoin is now challenging the first Fibonacci extension at $107,000 after breaking out and retesting key levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullishness For Q3 Grows: What Happens In Every Post-Halving Year? Once the Bitcoin price clears this Fibonacci extension, Titan of Crypto believes that the next stop is $135,000. He revealed that the market structure supports this move, but it remains to be seen if momentum will follow. His accompanying chart showed that BTC could reach this Fibonacci extension at $135,000 by September, aligning with Stockmoney’s prediction. The chart also suggested that BTC could still rally to as high as $150,000 at some point. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $108,200, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.
