Details of the transaction indicate that the country transferred 137.245 BTC, valued at approximately $14.77 million, to the exchange on June 30, according to the latest on-chain data obtained by Finbold from Arkham Intelligence. Kingdom of Bhutan Bitcoin transaction. Source: Arkham The potential for a sale comes as the Asian nation’s Bitcoin stash has grown significantly. As of press time, Bhutan holds 11,924 BTC, valued at approximately $1.28 billion. Notably, these holdings have been built mainly through state-supported mining operations controlled by Druk Holding and Investments. Currently, there is no official explanation for the Binance deposit; however, historically, moving funds to exchanges often signals plans to sell. Impact of Bhutan’s possible Bitcoin sale Offloading a large amount could introduce short-term volatility for Bitcoin, especially as the cryptocurrency is at a critical point where it may face a correction after repeated rejections near the $110,000 level. By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $107,636. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Notably, Bhutan is among the few countries, alongside El Salvador, that have been strategically accumulating Bitcoin. On the other hand, El Salvador has made Bitcoin legal tender and follows a “no-sell” strategy of periodic buying. In contrast, most government-held Bitcoin originates from criminal seizures, with the United States holding the largest share, mainly due to the Silk Road case. Meanwhile, the Himalayan nation is working to grow its crypto ecosystem beyond mining. For example, at the recent Digital Bhutan panel co-hosted with Binance, officials outlined plans to integrate cryptocurrency into everyday life. Building on the May 2025 launch of a crypto-backed tourism payment system developed with Binance and DK Bank, the platform uses Bhutan’s Bitcoin reserves to enable over 100 cryptocurrencies to be spent fee-free at more than 1,000 merchants via Binance Pay.

The deadline, which Trump implemented earlier, is when the 25% tariffs on most of the U.S. trading partners kick back in. However, he did signal that the White House could do anything it wanted, either extending the deadline or even shortening it.

2025-06-30T17:36:39,"Bitcoin stalls below $108K as long term holders sell, ARB, AERO, PYTH led altcoins","Bitcoin drifted sideways during Monday’s Asian session, showing little ambition to break free from its narrow trading range as the market treaded cautiously with a hint of optimism. Across the broader crypto landscape, the total market capitalisation shed around 2.5%, with most of the pain felt in the altcoin space. Market sentiment, however, hadn’t turned sour just yet. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index remained in “Greed” territory, though it dipped two points to 66, hinting at a touch of hesitation creeping in. Why is Bitcoin price stuck? Bitcoin traded within a tight range between $106,951 and $108,771 throughout the day as long-term holders continued to exert selling pressure, effectively capping upward momentum despite a surge of institutional interest. Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards attributed the recent slowdown to long-term holders, who have been offloading their positions since the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. “People are wondering why Bitcoin has been stuck at $100K so long, despite the institutional FOMO,” he said in a Sunday X post, explaining that recent buyer inflows are being absorbed by these early holders exiting the market. According to Edwards, Bitcoin’s holder profile is shifting, as six-month holders, mainly new entrants like corporate treasuries, are gaining ground. In just two months, this group has reportedly absorbed almost all the BTC that long-term holders have been unloading for the past 18 months. Rental traders were also booking profits ahead of the July 9 tariff deadline, wary of unresolved trade issues between the US and key trading partners that could rattle global markets. The looming deadline marks the potential implementation of reciprocal tariffs, adding pressure to risk assets across equities and crypto. Further caution stemmed from the anticipation of key macroeconomic updates out of the US this week. Simultaneously, market participants are closely watching progress on developments surrounding President Trump’s proposed budget bill, which includes controversial spending cuts and tax reforms. Investors remain on edge, as any unexpected shifts in fiscal or trade policy could trigger a broader risk-off move, prompting capital to flow out of riskier assets like cryptocurrencies and into safer havens. What’s next for Bitcoin? Despite the broader dip in risk appetite, some traders remain convinced that a breakout to fresh all-time highs is only a matter of time. Bitcoin’s price has remained stuck below $108,000 since falling under that threshold on June 11, and market watchers say the key battleground lies just above. Price activity over the past 24 hours shows repeated attempts to build a base around $106,000–$107,000, with strong buy interest absorbing downside pressure. Meanwhile, significant ask-side interest continues to stack up around $109,000 and stretches as high as $113,000, suggesting a potential squeeze scenario if upward momentum returns. “Bitcoin is pushing into the $109,000 liquidity this morning as mentioned last night. The question is, will it have enough to push on through and hold?” crypto analyst AlphaBTC said in a Monday X post. As of press time, Coinglass data shows Bitcoin grinding through high-risk zones near $108,000.

Some bullish momentum may also come from the monthly and quarterly candle closes, both of which are now drawing attention. Bitcoin looks set to close June in the green, despite headline-driven volatility that kept traders on edge throughout the month. According to data from CoinGlass, BTC is on track for a 30% gain for Q2 2025, an impressive quarterly performance that many traders believe could act as a launchpad for renewed upside. A green June close, paired with a strong quarterly candle, is fuelling confidence that Bitcoin’s current consolidation is a pause rather than a local top. When writing, Bitcoin was hovering around $107,517, down 0.2% in the past day. Top altcoin gainers The altcoin market in the past 24 hours rose 2.3% to an intraday high of $1.32 trillion before ending the day 1.3% lower at $1.28 trillion. This came as the Altcoin Season Index reading fell to 19. Ethereum, the largest altcoin by market cap, dipped slightly over the day, trading at a little above $2.400 as of press time. Other large-cap altcoins like Solana (SOL), Tron (TRX), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Cardano (ADA) also recorded slight gains while XRP (XRP) remained relatively flat for the day. Arbitrum (ARB) led daily gains among the top 99 altcoins with 14.5% gains, while Aerodrome Finance (AERO) and Pyth Network (PYTH) followed with gains of 6.1% and 5% respectively. Source: CoinMarketCap ARB’s price shot up today as rumors of a potential partnership with popular retail trading platform Robinhood saw renewed momentum on news that a key official from Offchain Labs, the team behind Arbitrum, would join Robinhood’s crypto GM at a panel during an event hosted by Robinhood Europe in Cannes. Traders are likely expecting the project to confirm the partnership. Meanwhile, AERO rallied after the Aerodome developers teased a major announcement set to be unveiled later this week. As for PYTH, today’s gains were triggered after Keyring Network, in collaboration with Euler Finance, Multipli, and Pyth Network, announced the launch of zkVerified markets on Avalanche. Traders responded positively to the development, viewing it as a major step toward bridging institutional capital with DeFi in a privacy-preserving way. With Pyth supplying real-time price feeds for the new markets, demand for its oracle services is expected to rise.

Bullish Dojis Suggest Upward Move","Crypto analyst Stockmoney Lizards has provided an update on the current Bitcoin price action, predicting that the flagship crypto could reach as high $145,000 later this year. The analyst alluded to a doji pattern, which supports this bullish prediction. Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price Rally To $145,000 In an X post, Stockmoney Lizards stated that his mid-term target for the Bitcoin price is between $135,000 and $145,000. He expects BTC to reach these targets between September and October later this year. The analyst also touched on the current price action and why he believes the flagship crypto will reach such lofty heights. Related Reading: Extended Wave 5 Scenario Puts Bitcoin Price Above $300,000 With Step-Like Structure In Place Stockmoney noted that the Bitcoin price is trading at the upper level of the corrective channel, forming some dojis at this level. He admitted that he doesn’t know how many bounces market participants will see from BTC and what levels the crypto will test. He raised the possibility that the local bottom may be in and also that BTC could retest the $90,000 to $94,000 range. The analyst stated that if he had to bet, he would probably predict that the Bitcoin price taps the high of the $90,000 range again. BTC had dropped to as low as $98,000 last week amid the escalated tensions between Israel and Iran. Bitcoin has since recovered following the ceasefire between both countries. Stockmoney affirmed that the latest Bitcoin price action is a bullish formation as the flagship crypto has had an impulsive move up. He added that the current price action is not the usual money rotation with old traders selling and new traders loading up at range lows. The analyst also indicated that BTC’s rally isn’t driven by the derivatives market either. BTC To At Least Reach $135,000 Crypto analyst Titan of Crypto has echoed Stockmoney’s prediction that the Bitcoin price could at least reach $135,000. In an X post, the analyst declared that BTC’s path to this price target remains intact. He stated that Bitcoin is now challenging the first Fibonacci extension at $107,000 after breaking out and retesting key levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullishness For Q3 Grows: What Happens In Every Post-Halving Year? Once the Bitcoin price clears this Fibonacci extension, Titan of Crypto believes that the next stop is $135,000. He revealed that the market structure supports this move, but it remains to be seen if momentum will follow. His accompanying chart showed that BTC could reach this Fibonacci extension at $135,000 by September, aligning with Stockmoney’s prediction. The chart also suggested that BTC could still rally to as high as $150,000 at some point.

According to a post on X , the recent purchase cost approximately $531.9 million, with an average price of $106,801 per Bitcoin. Strategy’s BTC Acquisition is Not Ending Soon Interestingly, Strategy’s recent acquisition has increased its total Bitcoin holdings to 597,325 BTC, valued at around $42.4 billion. The company’s average purchase price for all its Bitcoins now is $70,982 each. With these numbers, Strategy is the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin worldwide. Notably, the business intelligence software firm’s year-to-date Bitcoin gain has increased to 85,871 BTC, which is worth about $9.5 billion. This shows the company’s strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value. It is worth noting that the funding for this purchase came from several sources, including the sale of Class A common stock, MSTR, perpetual preferred stock, STRK, and Strife preferred stock. This approach to financing highlights Strategy’s commitment to holding Bitcoin as a key part of its treasury reserve. Michael Saylor also hinted at a new purchase. In a recent update about his company’s Bitcoin investments, he said, “In 21 years, you’ll wish you’d bought more.” He repeated this idea in his recent speech , predicting that Bitcoin could reach a value of $21 million per coin in 21 years. Strategy Accused of Misleading Bitcoin Statements Meanwhile, Strategy has become the subject of discussion among several firms, with a number of them bringing lawsuits against the BTC behemoth. As reported by TheCoinRise, five law firms filed identical class action lawsuits against Strategy . The prosecutors have charged the firm with securities fraud related to the Bitcoin treasury it has built over the past five years. They accused the firm of making misleading investment statements, including some about Bitcoin and Strategy’s business, operations, and prospects. Additionally, a Strategy has been outlined for mitigating the various risks associated with Bitcoin’s volatility. These firms are seeking to recover damages from Strategy. Michael Saylor Hints at More BTC Buys However, Michael Saylor has recently hinted at a potential acquisition of Bitcoin . Saylor posted a chart on X displaying his firm’s historic Bitcoin purchases, accompanied by the cryptic caption: “Nothing Stops This Orange.” The statement echoes similar past posts that preceded major Bitcoin buys. Likewise, the post comes amid legal troubles for Saylor and Strategy’s top leadership. Despite the legal headwinds, Saylor’s continued bullish stance suggests that the company will continue to expand its Bitcoin treasury. Recall that the firm purchased 245 Bitcoins approximately $26 million , at an average price of $105,856 per coin.

2025-06-30T17:00:59,"Bitcoin Realized Supply Ratio Signals Equilibrium – Similar To Pre-Rally Levels In Late 2024","Bitcoin has been attempting to break above the critical $109,000 level since last week but continues to face stiff resistance. Despite multiple intraday pushes, bulls have been unable to secure a decisive close above this key zone, keeping the market in a state of suspense. While BTC remains firmly above the psychological $100,000 mark, the longer it fails to reclaim $109K and move into price discovery, the greater the risk that bullish momentum could start to fade. For now, buyers are still holding strong, defending support levels and keeping the uptrend structure intact. However, without a confirmed breakout, traders are becoming increasingly cautious. A clean move into new all-time highs would likely trigger renewed capital inflows and broader market confidence, but until that happens, Bitcoin remains at a crossroads. Supporting this uncertain outlook is fresh data from CryptoQuant, which shows that BTC is currently trading just above its annual Realized Price ratio level. This suggests that Bitcoin is neither significantly overbought nor oversold, placing the market in a neutral zone. Historically, such positioning has often preceded major directional moves , making the coming days critical in determining whether BTC breaks higher or loses momentum. Bitcoin Metrics Signal Market Neutrality Bitcoin has been in a consolidation phase since early May, maintaining a firm position above the $100,000 level despite several attempts by bears to break it. The only significant dip below this psychological threshold occurred on June 22, and even then, BTC quickly recovered within hours. This resilience highlights the strength of buyer interest at six-figure levels. However, while bulls have successfully defended support, they’ve been unable to push past the critical $110,000 resistance, leading to growing speculation that a correction may be looming. Adding valuable context to this uncertainty, top analyst Axel Adler shared insights into the Bitcoin Distribution by Realized Supply metric—a tool used to assess how expensive BTC is relative to what investors actually paid for it. Realized Supply calculates the total dollar value of all Bitcoin based on the prices at which coins last moved, offering a more grounded view of valuation. The metric’s ratio, defined as BTC Price / Realized Supply, functions similarly to the P/E ratio in equities. A high ratio can suggest overvaluation, while a low one implies potential undervaluation. Currently, Bitcoin’s price is just slightly above the annual ratio level, putting it in a neutral valuation zone. Interestingly, this is the same setup seen in November 2024, right before BTC surged from $74K to $107K. This suggests the market is neither overheated nor undervalued, positioning Bitcoin in a balanced zone where major moves could develop in either direction. As long as BTC remains in this range without a clear breakout or breakdown, traders should stay alert—this phase could be the calm before the next big shift. BTC Faces Rejection At $109K As Price Consolidates Bitcoin is currently trading at $107,531 on the 12-hour chart, showing signs of consolidation just below the critical resistance zone at $109,300. This level has acted as a ceiling for over a month, with multiple failed breakout attempts. The latest rejection from this level reflects the ongoing struggle between bulls and bears, as neither side has been able to confirm a decisive move. Despite the rejection, the overall structure remains bullish. BTC continues to hold above all key moving averages—50 SMA ($105,923), 100 SMA ($105,942), and 200 SMA ($97,290)—with the 50 and 100 SMAs converging as dynamic support around the $106K level. This alignment favors bullish continuation if buyers can maintain pressure. Volume has yet to show a convincing surge, indicating that traders are still waiting for confirmation before fully committing to new positions. A strong candle close above $109,300 would likely trigger upside momentum and shift BTC into price discovery. On the flip side, a drop below $105,000 would put the $103,600 support at risk and open the door to a broader pullback.

These are the best Q2 returns for both assets since the post-COVID rally in 2020. BTC and ETH quarterly gains | Source: CoinGlass As of Jun. 30, Bitcoin is trading near $107,500 and Ethereum is holding around $2,450. On a weekly basis, they are up 6% and 9%, underpinning the broader upward trend that has taken shape over the past few weeks. The first quarter of 2025 had started on a much weaker note. Bitcoin fell 11.82% in Q1, giving back part of its massive 47.73% rally in the final quarter of 2024. Ethereum dropped even more sharply, ending Q1 with a 45.41% loss, marking its worst quarterly performance since the 2022 bear market. Trade tensions under the Trump administration, along with renewed geopolitical instability in Europe and the Middle East, created a risk-off environment that pulled capital away from speculative assets, including crypto. The turnaround in Q2 is notable. Ethereum has recovered nearly 80% of its first-quarter losses. Bitcoin, while not yet at its all-time highs, is now trading within reach of that level. Historically, Q4 and Q1 have delivered stronger results for Bitcoin and Ethereum, often tied to end-of-year positioning and early-cycle optimism. Q2 tends to be more volatile, with outcomes often shaped by policy developments and regulatory activity. In 2022, Bitcoin posted a Q2 loss of 56.2%, while Ethereum dropped 67.34%. The following year saw modest Q2 gains of 7.19% and 6.29% for BTC and ETH respectively. Against that backdrop, the performance in Q2 2025 stands out not just for its scale, but for reversing a sharp downtrend from earlier in the year. Spot ETF volumes bounce back One of the defining features of Q2’s crypto recovery has been the steady rise in institutional participation, particularly through spot ETFs. Bitcoin ETFs, led by BlackRock’s IBIT, saw a notable resurgence in investor interest through June, effectively ending a brief period of declining activity. According to data, over 210 million IBIT shares were traded in the week ending Jun. 27, reflecting a 22.2% increase from the previous week and reversing a four-week downtrend in trading volume. That volume recovery has been accompanied by consistent capital inflows. BlackRock’s IBIT alone attracted $1.31 billion in net inflows last week, slightly ahead of the $1.23 billion it pulled in the week prior. Over the month of June, the fund has drawn in $3.74 billion, reflecting its dominant role in channeling large-scale investment into Bitcoin. Cumulatively, all 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs listed in the U.S. have attracted over $4 billion in net inflows this month, marking their third straight month of positive flows. Moreover, since Jun. 9, the segment has not recorded a single net outflow day, a sign that institutional demand is holding steady despite broader market uncertainties. As of this writing on Jun. 30, all the spot BTC ETFs have a combined assets under management exceeding $135 billion. Meanwhile, Ethereum ETFs have shown a similar course , albeit on a smaller base. Inflows into spot ETH ETFs climbed to $283 million last week, a sharp rise from the $40 million added the week before. That jump has helped June surpass May and April’s figures, with a total of $1.13 billion entering Ethereum ETFs this month. In comparison, May saw $564 million in inflows, and April had $66.2 million. Over the past seven weeks, ETH ETFs have now recorded uninterrupted weekly inflows, the longest streak since their inception. Total cumulative inflows into Ethereum ETFs have exceeded $4.1 billion since September, bringing total AUM to $9.88 billion. BlackRock’s ETHA fund currently holds the largest share, with $4.25 billion in assets. While this is still smaller than Bitcoin’s footprint in the ETF space, the pace of growth over the past two months indicates growing confidence in Ethereum’s investment thesis. Crypto’s institutional reframing Recent moves by institutional leaders and policymakers suggest a shift in how Bitcoin and Ethereum are perceived in modern portfolios. Ric Edelman, founder of the $300 billion advisory firm Edelman Financial Engines, has laid out a new investment framework that places crypto in every category of investor allocation. . @ricedelman , who founded $300bil investment advisory firm Edelman Financial Engines… Recommends *40%* crypto allocation for aggressive investors. 10% for conservative. Says owning crypto is no longer a speculative position; failing to do so is. Look at these takeaways. pic.twitter.com/OB5N5c6cAQ — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) June 30, 2025 Edelman’s recommendation proposes that even conservative investors allocate 10% to crypto, with moderate clients going up to 25% and aggressive ones as high as 40%. His outlook challenges the long-standing 60-40 stock-bond model and positions crypto not as a speculative add-on but as an essential component of diversified exposure. Edelman’s reasoning is rooted in historical data. Over the past 15 years, Bitcoin has outperformed all other asset classes. Portfolios that included Bitcoin have shown stronger returns and lower drawdowns, while also scoring higher on traditional portfolio metrics such as the Sharpe and Sortino ratios. The market appears to be following through on this logic. MicroStrategy, on Jun. 29, acquired another 4,980 BTC at an average price of $106,801 per coin, bringing its total holdings to 597,325 BTC, purchased at an average of just under $71,000. The firm’s Bitcoin yield year-to-date is nearly 20%. Strategy has acquired 4,980 BTC for ~$531.9 million at ~$106,801 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 19.7% YTD 2025. As of 6/29/2025, we hodl 597,325 $BTC acquired for ~$42.40 billion at ~$70,982 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRK $STRF $STRD https://t.co/xvWnSkfukS — Michael Saylor (@saylor) June 30, 2025 Wall Street strategist Tom Lee is also placing a bold bet on crypto. Now serving as chairman of BitMine, a small Bitcoin mining firm, Lee is backing a $250 million capital raise aimed at transforming the company into the largest public holder of Ethereum. ⚡️JUST IN: TOM LEE WANTS TO BUILD ETHEREUM’S ""MICROSTRATEGY"" Wall Street Strategist Lee is now Chairman of BitMine, a tiny BTC miner aiming to become the largest public #ETH holder! 🚀 A $250M raise will fund its Ether-first treasury —echoing Saylor’s BTC strategy. 🟠 pic.twitter.com/dCE7uOUGVL — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) June 30, 2025 The plan involves building an Ether-first treasury strategy modeled on Strategy’s Bitcoin approach, confriming growing institutional interest in Ethereum as a core reserve asset. Meanwhile, Kazakhstan’s central bank is studying the creation of a national crypto reserve. The proposal includes using assets sourced from government-run mining and confiscations, with the goal of placing them under regulated central control. Authorities have acknowledged the risks of volatility but argue that structured oversight can offer better integration into national financial frameworks. If implemented, Kazakhstan would be one of the earliest nations to formally hold crypto at the central bank level, following El Salvador and the U.S. Amid this, macroeconomic policy remains a wildcard. The Federal Reserve has kept interest rates steady at 4.25% to 4.50%, but Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari has reaffirmed expectations of two rate cuts before the end of the year. The first could come as early as September, depending on incoming inflation and employment data. President Trump has also renewed calls for a sharper cut, targeting a 1% policy rate in the upcoming July meeting. If the Federal Reserve proceeds with rate cuts while institutions continue to scale up exposure, capital could keep flowing into risk assets, especially crypto. Bitcoin may remain the primary beneficiary as a macro hedge, while Ethereum could gain from capital trickle-down effects. Macro will decide the next move Heading into Q3, all eyes will be on the Fed’s July meeting and its response to cooling inflation data. A confirmed rate cut could reinforce risk-on sentiment across markets, with crypto likely to benefit from renewed capital inflows. Traders will also be watching for updates on the U.S. crypto tax bill, enforcement actions, and spot ETF expansion, especially around Ethereum. If ETH ETFs continue attracting steady inflows, Ethereum may begin to close the gap with Bitcoin in institutional portfolios. In the background, macro events remain unpredictable. Any escalation in global trade tensions, especially involving China and the U.S., could revive volatility. Meanwhile, on-chain data suggests leverage in derivatives markets is climbing again, which could amplify both rallies and corrections in the weeks ahead. For now, the market is holding its Q2 gains, but sustained momentum will likely depend on a clear rate cut signal and continued institutional positioning. Without either, the rally could stall. But if both align, Q3 could extend the uptrend, with Ethereum potentially leading the next leg. However, nothing is ever guaranteed in the crypto world.

The latest records from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services show that Central Kentucky Radiology (CKR) suffered a hacking/IT incident affecting 166,953 Americans. In a notice , CKR says that an unknown attacker breached the firm’s systems, stealing patient data that may include names, Social Security numbers, addresses, dates of birth, dates of medical service and medical services charges. “On October 18, 2024, CKR became aware of a network disruption in its environment. CKR immediately took steps to secure our systems and launched an investigation into the nature and scope of the event. The investigation determined that from October 16 to October 18, 2024, an unauthorized actor accessed and copied files from certain systems in its environment. In response, CKR conducted a detailed review of the potentially impacted files to understand their content and to whom they relate. On May 7, 2025, CKR completed this review and determined that information related to you was contained in the potentially impacted files.” CKR is a doctor-led radiology medical group offering diagnostic and interventional imaging services to hospitals, outpatient centers and physician offices.

2025-06-30T16:53:47,"Sparkassen, the German bank that said ‘Nein’ to Bitcoin is now building a gateway","Three years after shutting down the idea, Germany’s largest banking group is making a U-turn. Sparkassen plans to let retail clients trade Bitcoin and other digital assets by 2026, signaling a seismic shift in traditional finance’s stance on crypto. On June 30, Bloomberg reported that Sparkassen, the German sprawling network of savings banks with roughly 50 million clients, will roll out cryptocurrency trading for retail customers by summer 2026, marking a stark reversal from its 2023 decision to block such services. The move, confirmed by the German Savings Banks and Giro Association, will allow customers to buy and sell digital assets like Bitcoin ( BTC ) through DekaBank, Sparkassen’s securities arm, via their existing banking apps. The pivot marks more than a product rollout. In a country where conservative banking has long defined consumer finance, Sparkassen’s move signals a broader institutional acceptance of digital assets as part of the future financial landscape. You might also like: SOL spot ETF with staking could go live this week, expert says From resistance to reluctant adoption: why Sparkassen flipped on crypto In 2023, Sparkassen’s internal committee dismissed crypto as too volatile, too risky, and too far outside traditional banking’s comfort zone. Today, that same institution is preparing to onboard millions of Germans into Bitcoin and other digital assets. What changed? A mix of regulatory clarity, competitive pressure, and undeniable client demand seem to have created forces too strong for even Europe’s most conservative banks to ignore. The timing closely tracks the turning point that came with the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation, which provided a long-awaited rulebook for banks entering the space. No longer forced to navigate a gray area, Sparkassen could finally build a compliant framework backed by DekaBank’s securities infrastructure. But regulation alone doesn’t explain the urgency. Matthias Dießl, chairman of the Bavarian Savings Banks Association, hinted at the real driver in an April interview with Bloomberg: “Our clients are asking for this.” With rival German cooperative banks like Volksbanken already racing toward crypto services, Sparkassen risked losing relevance if it stood still. Sparkassen isn’t acting in isolation. Beyond Germany, banks and traditional financial institutions across Europe are making calculated bets on digital assets, each with a slightly different approach. Standard Chartered, one of the world’s largest banks, secured a MiCA license in Luxembourg earlier this year, offering institutional-grade custody for Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH ). Notably, it stopped short of enabling trading, a contrast to Sparkassen’s retail-first plunge. BNP Paribas and Société Générale have also quietly expanded crypto custody and asset tokenization experiments, though neither has yet taken the full retail leap. Sparkassen’s reversal isn’t just a business decision; it’s a cultural shift. With MiCA in play, the EU is effectively forcing traditional finance to choose: adapt or cede ground to agile competitors.

2025-06-30T16:49:21,"XRP Price Prediction – RLUSD Becomes the Fastest-Growing Stablecoin: XRP to $10 Next?","The XRP price (XRP) has gone up by 9.1% in the past 7 days as cryptos continue recovering from last week’s sharp pullback triggered by rising Middle East tensions. Once again, the native asset of the Ripple network has returned to positive year-to-date gains, now up 4.8% since January. Ripple has also doubled down on ecosystem expansion, with new initiatives focused on accelerating adoption of its stablecoin, Ripple USD (RLUSD). As these efforts gain traction, the XRP price prediction has turned increasingly bullish — with some analysts eyeing a potential breakout in the coming weeks. Data from DeFi Llama indicates that this token’s market cap has been expanding rapidly this year from $58 million to $455 million at the time of writing, making it the fastest-growing stablecoin. @Ripple 's RLUSD stablecoin is growing on @ethereum , with supply up ~4x since January. pic.twitter.com/nQ88TYVtnc — Token Terminal (@tokenterminal) June 28, 2025 The majority of RLUSD’s circulating supply is currently on the Ethereum network. In the past month, the token’s market cap in this network has jumped by 61%. Since its launch, RLUSD has processed cumulative volumes of $10 billion since its launch as the token has been listed by multiple top exchanges like Kraken, Bitstamp, Bitget, and Gemini. Growing adoption of RLUSD across the globe and on-chain favors a bullish XRP price action , especially if transaction volumes start to increase within the Ripple network as a result of its rising popularity. XRP Price Prediction: XRP Could Retest the $2.33 Level as Cryptos Keep Recovering Looking at the 4-hour chart for XRP, the price has successfully bounced off the 2.07 support and has already moved near the $2.2 level. Geopolitical risks seem to have eased, or at least the market has embraced that perception, as Israel and Iran negotiated a cease-fire with the help of President Donald Trump. Meanwhile, the Chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, confirmed this week that the institution still plans to cut rates twice this year despite the uncertainty caused by the administration’s aggressive trade policies. This has improved XRP’s outlook in the near term and supports a push to its nearest resistance at 2.33. Momentum indicators are still in positive territory as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits above 50. Although XRP may not get to $10 in the next few days, an expanding RLUSD market cap means that it could get there in the months to come. The stablecoin’s success could skyrocket Ripple’s transaction volumes and create a new source of demand for the utility token. As crypto continues to recover, a new crypto presale called BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) will benefit from Bitcoin’s ongoing push to a new all-time high. BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) Introduces Reward System Tied to Bitcoin’s Price Milestones BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) gives investors the chance to earn passive income as Bitcoin continues to make higher highs. This meme coin’s reward system is tied to the performance of the top crypto and automatically distributes these prizes once a new price milestone is hit. Starting at a baseline price of $100,000, BTCBULL holders will receive a new reward for every $25,000 that BTC adds to its price. The first milestone in the roadmap is set at $125,000, at which point a portion of the token’s circulating supply will be burned. Next up, once Bitcoin hits $150K, BTCBULL investors will receive a direct airdrop of Bitcoin. To buy $BTCBULL and start earning passive income, head to the BTC Bull Token website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH or use a bank card to invest.

2025-06-30T16:33:36,"Pi Coin Price Prediction – Pi Network Quietly Just Got a Whole Lot More Powerful: Here’s Why It Matters","The Pi Coin price has dropped by 4% in the past 24 hours, with its fall to $0.5104 coming as the crypto market as a whole declines by 1.5% today. PI is now flat in the past week but down by 15% in a fortnight and by 17% in the last 30 days, with the altcoin also suffering an 83% decline since peaking at $2.99 on February 26. Despite these losses, Pi Network has been steadily upgrading and improving itself over the past few months, with Pi2Day (June 28) seeing the platform roll out two interesting applications.

Pi Coin Price Prediction – Pi Network Quietly Just Got a Whole Lot More Powerful: Here’s Why It Matters Marking Pi2Day on X, Pi Network’s team announced that it’s adding “two exciting features to the ecosystem,” while also delivering several minor tech and product updates. Happy Pi2Day 2025! Today, Pi has introduced two exciting features to the ecosystem and provided various tech and product updates. First, Pi App Studio is an AI-powered platform that enables anyone to create Pi apps without coding—created to solve problems the world faces as AI… pic.twitter.com/6ZiVefdYsZ — Pi Network (@PiCoreTeam) June 28, 2025 The first, and arguably the most exciting, is an AI-powered app development studio that, according to Pi Network, enables “anyone to create Pi apps without coding.” The second is Ecosystem Directory Staking, a feature that allows users and developers to boost a given app’s ranking in Pi’s Ecosystem Interface by staking PI. However, the wider crypto ecosystem doesn’t seem too fussed about these upgrades, with PI having a disappointing day so far. If we look at its chart, we see that it continues to show quite acute weakness, having occupied a steadily descending band since a peak in the middle of May. Its RSI (purple) has gone from 70 a week ago to just under 40 today, and it looks as though it may continue descending for a few days yet. Source: TradingView Something similar is happening with its moving average convergence divergence (orange, blue), which has also recently begun declining. The technicals therefore don’t look great for the Pi Coin price, which could slip below $0.50 in the next week or so, and maybe even reach $0.45 or $0.40 before bottoming out. However, the aforementioned upgrades highlight how Pi Network is taking steps to improve its utility and attract developers, apps and users to its network, something which does have positive medium- and long-term implications. It could therefore begin recovering more steadily in concert with the wider market, which continues to react badly to tension in the Middle East and ongoing tariff issues . But if such issues continue to ease, the Pi Coin price could reach $1 again within a few weeks and even higher by the end of the year. Best Wallet Raises $13.6 Million in Native Token Presale: The Strongest New Coin of 2025? On the other hand, there’s always a chance that, without major exchange listings, Pi Network will continue to decline. If so, traders may prefer to turn to alternatives already, and fortunately there is a wide variety of new interesting tokens on the market. Some of these are presale coins, which can raise large sums of money and then go on to rally strongly after listing for the first time. One coin with a good chance of doing this is Best Wallet Token (BEST), an ERC-20 coin that has now raised $13.6 million in its sale. Over $13M Raised and Counting!

The token has since retreated to $85.21, down 3.17% since the session’s peak and 1.5% in the last 24-hour period. That stumble erased the week’s slim gains and set a new line in the sand for bulls.

2025-06-30T16:25:39,"GDLC Is A Sell Ahead Of Its Imminent, Likely Conversion To An ETF","Summary GDLC now trades at fair value after closing its NAV discount, removing the prior arbitrage opportunity that drove outperformance versus Bitcoin. With a 2.5% expense ratio, poor liquidity, and no clear portfolio role, I think GDLC is fundamentally unattractive compared to direct crypto or ETF exposure. If ETF conversion is approved, GDLC offers no upside (an ETF cannot trade at premium); if denied, it risks returning to a NAV discount, both scenarios unfavorable for new investors. Given these factors, I recommend a SELL on GDLC at current prices, as there is effectively no upside in any likely scenario. I think investors who already have GDLC are better off converting their position (trading at fair value) into more efficient, more liquid products. In the world of cryptocurrencies, there are several proxies and exotic products that investors can utilize to gain exposure to this asset class. Some of these may resemble a black box, commanding a NAV premium (or discount) against their mere holdings for reasons that are unclear and debatable. Today, I discuss again one of these tools: the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund ETF ( OTCQX:GDLC ), which contains a set of cryptocurrencies (mostly Bitcoin) and currently trades roughly in line with its NAV. GLDC outperformed Bitcoin despite never converting into an ETF I covered the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund ETF ( OTCQX:GDLC ) roughly one year ago , at the time refraining from a “BUY” because I did not see a conversion to an ETF as likely. Yet, I did see a decent risk / reward for anyone already having the fund in their portfolio (given it traded at a NAV discount at that time) and ended up recommending a “HOLD”. As I suspected back then, GDLC never converted into an ETF. Despite SeekingAlpha calling it an “ETF”, the issuer clearly states this is not an ETF in the dedicated GLDC page . Grayscale defines GDLC as a publicly traded fund quoted on the OTC Markets Group under the Alternative Reporting Standards, where investors can buy and sell shares through traditional brokerage accounts at market-dictated prices. To be clear though, Grayscale has filed a request to the SEC to convert GDLC into an ETF in September 2024. While the SEC has not yet ruled on this request, it is supposed to do so by July 2nd - in a few days from when this article was written. This reason is also why I am recommending a SELL today, as I will outline later in the article. Despite being right about GDLC not becoming an ETF, I recognize I was too cautious with my HOLD recommendation. As the chart below shows, in the last year GDLC outperformed Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). When it comes to Bitcoin proxies, it was only beaten by MicroStrategy Incorporated ( MSTR ) during that time frame. Bitcoin miners lagged behind both BTC and GDLC. GDLC vs. BTC and proxies, 1 year (Seeking Alpha) This overperformance, in my view, is derived from GDLC closing its NAV discount and even briefly trading at a NAV premium a few months ago . Most of GDLC's performance happened in late 2024 - something unsurprising given that's exactly when Grayscale filed for the conversion of this fund into an ETF. GDLC traded at roughly a ~30% NAV discount one year ago, at the time of my first coverage. The gap closed and it even became a NAV premium of roughly 10% in April. Today, GDLC trades roughly in line with the value of its holdings as per my calculations below: BTC per share: 0.00036294 × $ 107,500 = $ 39.01 ETH-USD per share: 0.00220672 × $2,450 = $5.40 XRP-USD per share: 1.06345318 × $2.18 = $2.31 SOL-USD per share: 0.00935443 × $150 = $1.40 ADA-USD per share: 0.65811335 × $0.57 = $0.37 For a total of $ 48.51 worth of cryptocurrencies per share, against a share price of $ 47.40 at the time of writing, the fund trades roughly at the value of its NAV. This marginal discount of less than 2% is in my opinion negligible , especially considering the fund charges a hefty 2.50% yearly expense ratio to investors (more on these later). To note, if Grayscale succeeds into making GDLC into an ETF, this gap will close completely and permanently - as ETFs do not trade at a significant premium or discount against their holdings (net of fees and liquidity). My fundamental issue with GDLC as an investment: its objectives When I evaluate any fund or an ETF, I always start by asking myself what is the objective of such a fund and what role it may play in an investor’s portfolio. The main issue I have with GDLC is that I struggle to see any use case for investors. This fund is effectively a sort of relic of the past - it was launched in 2018, back when the regulatory framework for cryptocurrency was still fairly hostile and investors had difficulty gaining exposure to this asset class. In that context, paying a 2.50% fee for a somewhat illiquid product with questionable allocation to cryptocurrencies may have made sense to gain exposure to a nascent asset class. A plus back then was that GDLC represented one of the few SEC-registered crypto products. Today, crypto ETFs are available via normal brokerages and investors can also access crypto via increasingly regulated and safer centralized exchanges such as Coinbase Global, Inc ( COIN ). What’s more, is that the crypto space has matured since 2018 and, in my view, Bitcoin emerged as a clear winner of the space so far. Bitcoin’s dominance (Bitcoin’s market cap relative to the whole crypto space) is close to all time highs at ~65% , while it was in the low 40s when the fund launched. Many cryptocurrencies also became irrelevant in that time frame. GDLC’s holdings (reflecting the first five cryptocurrencies by market capitalization) show this, since the fund today features more than 80% of its holdings in Bitcoin itself. Even just one year ago, at the time of my first coverage, GDLC held Avalanche ( AVAX-USD ), a cryptocurrency that today it does not feature anymore, having been replaced by Cardano. I see such dynamics as reflecting a rapidly changing cryptocurrency landscape which makes GDLC fundamentally unattractive by design as a long term vehicle for crypto exposure. In simple words, I believe that investors wanting to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies would be better off simply buying them separately either as ETFs or via regulated crypto exchanges. That would also allow them to fine tune their exposure to the projects (and the weights) they deem best for their portfolios. Given an unclear use case of GDLC and the fact the fund trades already at a fair NAV valuation (which is set to remain as such in case of a successful ETF conversion), I do not see any other reason why it should keep overperforming in the future. GDLC vs. BTC and proxies, 3 months (Seeking Alpha) This is already observable in the last 3 months, when GDLC started to show a relative underperformance, returning just about the same as Bitcoin. I expect this trend to continue, and GDLC to keep performing in line with its underlying assets, net of its expenses. Why I recommend a SELL for GDLC ahead of its (likely?) ETF conversion The issues I described in the previous section are only compounded by the fund’s hefty yearly expense ratio, at 2.50%, as well as by its relative illiquidity. GDLC has a bid/ask spread of roughly 0.15%, and a risk grade, including tracking errors, that Seeking Alpha rates with a Failing grade (see picture below). GDLC Risk Grade (Seeking Alpha) In short, this is not a very efficient fund. A broad and passive exposure to cryptocurrency is also not achieved either by GDLC, given the fund’s exposure is mostly towards Bitcoin and Ethereum, which together make 91% of GDLC’s holdings. Which brings me back to my original issue with GDLC: its lack of a clear objective and role in one’s portfolio. Going forward, I see only two scenarios for GDLC: If the SEC approves its ETF conversion, the fund is already fairly priced and due to its hefty expense ratio and sub-par liquidity is set to slightly underperform its underlying assets. This scenario represents no upside for investors today. If the SEC does not approve its ETF conversion, I believe it reasonable the fund will start trading once again at a NAV discount , until there is a reason to believe a conversion will be likely again. This scenario represents a downside for investors today. Because of the above logic, I find myself having to recommend a SELL at current prices. The only scenario where I see GDLC performing is one where the ETF conversion does not get approved in July, but it gets approved in a few months - providing an arbitrage opportunity. I will cover this next in my risk section. Risks to my thesis The main risk to my thesis is that GDLC could keep outperforming Bitcoin. This happened already in the past year and might repeat in the near future, even if today GDLC trades already at a fair valuation and I do not see any reason the market would put a premium on its holdings. To be clear, I would only deem this scenario likely if the current ETF conversion does not get approved (if it does, there cannot be any NAV premium!). GDLC could then start trading again at a NAV premium, but only if there was some news emerging about investors' ability to cash out their holdings. For example, a new potential ETF conversion (i.e. the SEC changing their mind shortly after refusing the conversion). Admittedly, this is a far fetched scenario - but one that I need to outline for readers as a risk. Conclusion: I see no upside in GDLC against BTC (or its underlying assets) I was too cautious in rating GDLC a “HOLD” one year ago, when I covered it for the first time. While I was technically correct in assuming the fund would not be transformed into an ETF (it hasn’t yet), this was no obstacle to GDLC’s closing its NAV premium, rallying on the news Grayscale filed for an ETF conversion in September last year. Today, ahead of its possible ETF conversion, GDLC trades at a fair value, from a 30% NAV discount one year ago. As a result, GDLC outperformed Bitcoin by more than 20% in that time frame. The issue with entering a position in GDLC today, however, is that there is effectively no upside in any scenario. If an ETF does get approved, the fund is fairly priced already, with a minimal 2% NAV discount. If an ETF does not get approved, the fund may again trade at a more significant NAV discount. The only scenario where GDLC could provide upside for investors is one where the ETF conversion does not happen and somehow the market starts assigning a NAV premium to GDLC. Highly unlikely, in my view, and the reason why I recommend a SELL at current levels. Note that my SELL rating is in no way associated to my views about BTC or the crypto space , but merely reflects the fact I think GDLC will underperform its underlying crypto assets in virtue of its hefty fees and illiquidity. In other terms, I believe investors who have GDLC would be better off converting their positions into more efficient funds, such as crypto ETFs or buying cryptocurrency directly via a centralized exchange. Personally, I am also against the idea of holding a set of cryptocurrencies as an investment, as I see Bitcoin as a very different investment than any other cryptocurrency. This is however something that goes beyond the scope of this article and that I covered in my Bitcoin pieces in the past.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4798357-gdlc-sell-ahead-imminent-likely-conversion-to-etf?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","GDLC",cryptocompare

Unlike the commonly used 19b-4 registration model adopted by many issuers, REX opted for a strategy that leverages a regulatory workaround. Analysts say this approach positioned the REX-Osprey ETF for first approval, as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission appears to have moved to greenlight it following initial reservations . ETF Store president Nate Geraci commented that the regulator looks to be comfortable with the SOL + Staking ETF’s launch. Other experts also offered similar comments. “Rex just filed letter to SEC asking if comments have been resolved for their ‘40 Act Solana Staking ETF. They’re no doubt trying to get it to mkt ahead of the spot ones,” Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas wrote after REX’s post. According to REX Shares, the Solana ETF set to launch will be the first staking-enabled cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund in the United States. The ETF will track Solana’s price performance while allowing investors to generate yield through on-chain staking. In addition to SOL exposure, the product offers access to staking rewards. Solana price has increased 2% in the past 24 hours to break above $155, with daily volume up 45% to $3.66 billion.

2025-06-30T16:11:13,"Crypto Investment Products Sees $2.7B in Weekly Inflows","The crypto investments continues to show strong momentum, with digital asset funds experiencing another week of gains. In CoinShares’ latest report, it was revealed that digital fund investment attracted $2.7 billion into the market last week, pushing the total for the year to $17.8 billion. This marks the 11th consecutive week of inflows, showing steady interest and rising confidence in the crypto space. Crypto Confidence Grows as Investments Top $184 Billion The recent surge in cryptocurrency investments has increased the total value of digital asset funds to over $184 billion. This indicates steady market growth, as more people recognize the long-term value of digital assets. Experts attribute this growing interest partly to global political changes and uncertain financial policies. These factors are leading more investors to turn to crypto, especially Bitcoin, as a safer investment option. Bitcoin Takes the Lead in Growing Crypto Market Bitcoin remained the top choice for investors last week. Products linked to the world’s largest cryptocurrency drew $2.2 billion in inflows, representing 83% of the total inflow. This brings Bitcoin’s total inflows for the year to $14.9 billion. At the same time, products that bet against the digital coin experienced small outflows. These short-Bitcoin funds saw $2.9 million leave last week and have lost a total of $12 million this year. This trend suggests that market sentiment toward Bitcoin has turned more positive in 2025. Bitcoin has performed well this year, mainly due to increased crypto investment in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), particularly in the United States. BlackRock’s Bitcoin fund IBIT is one of the most popular. According to CoinShares’ report, BlackRock’s IBIT raised over $1.5 billion last week and more than $17 billion since its launch in January 2024. These successful ETFs have made the U.S. the leading destination for crypto investments. In 2025 alone, over $16.8 billion has flowed into the U.S.-based crypto products. Ethereum and Other Coins Keep Growing Ethereum investment products also did well last week, attracting $429 million. This brings the total amount invested in ETH this year to $2.9 billion. Analysts say Ethereum’s recent Pectra upgrade and growing interest from major investors have helped sustain its momentum. Other digital assets are also attracting attention. Solana (SOL) saw $5.3 million in new investments last week, bringing its yearly total to $91 million. However, XRP outpaced Solana, raking in $219 million this year, while Sui brought in $104 million. While the U.S. remains the leader in crypto investments, other countries are also making strong contributions. Germany saw $939 million in inflows this year, followed by Canada with $164 million and Australia with $148 million. This shows that crypto interest is spreading globally, not just in the U.S. The post Crypto Investment Products Sees $2.7B in Weekly Inflows appeared first on TheCoinrise.com .",thecoinrise,https://thecoinrise.com/crypto-investment-products-sees-2-7b-in-weekly-inflows/,"BTC|ETH|MARKET|BUSINESS|SOL","Bitcoin News|Bitcoin|Crypto Investments|ethereum",cryptocompare

At the same time, Solana (SOL) is attempting to break out of a descending channel. Is $SOL about to take over the reigns from $ETH? $ETH strong rejection from $2,500 horizontal resistance Source: TradingView The short-term chart for $ETH shows a rejection from the very important $2,500 horizontal resistance level. This follows another rejection a few days ago. It may be that $ETH will continue to tap on the glass until it breaks, but for the time being at least the price has come back to rest on the $2,450 support, with the possibility that it may come back down to $2,400. $ETH still in consolidation mode Source: TradingView As can be seen from the daily chart, the current price action is following on from a break of a long-time descending trendline. Therefore, the sideways price movement is probably just a period of consolidation before the next leg higher. $SOL breakout attempt Source: TradingView Meanwhile, $SOL bulls are attempting a difficult breakout right now. It’s difficult because not only do the bulls need to push the price beyond the long-time descending trendline, but also they need to force the price through the strong resistance band from $150 to $152. If the bulls are successful, this would be an extremely bullish breakout for $SOL. That said, with a lot of the short-term Stochastic RSI indicators just rolling over from the top, upside price momentum is not on the side of the bulls. If the price does reject from here, support levels can be found at $148, $144, and $142. NOTE: At time of going to press, the $SOL price has just surged up as high as $157. It will remain to be seen if this breakout can be maintained. $SOL bullish break targets $158 resistance level Source: TradingView The weekly time frame for $SOL shows the current breakout beyond the upper trendline of the descending channel. The next resistance is just above at $158. If the bulls can continue this push and thrust the price though this resistance, $180 is the next target. Even more bullish is the Stochastic RSI on the weekly time frame. This is currently signalling a crossover of the indicator lines, which if confirmed at the end of this week, could signal a bounce from the 50.00 level and a return to strong upward price momentum for $SOL going forward.

The combination of technical indicators and chart analysis suggests that Avalanche is bearish with dropping volatility. Chart analysis shows it will trade sideways over the short term. Recent news Filecoin Foundation and Avalanche have partnered to launch a new cross-chain data bridge. The bridge will allow developers to build on Avalanche’s C-Chain to store data on Filecoin’s decentralized network. Why is AVAX down? AVAX is correcting from its highest last year; the crypto market capitalization is also bearish. The drop in AVAX value could be attributed to the general market sentiment. Will AVAX reach $50? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, AVAX crossed the $50 mark in 2027. Will AVAX reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, AVAX will reach $100 in 2028, with a maximum price of $106.00 for the year. Can Avalanche reach $1,000? It remains highly unlikely that AVAX will cross the $1,000 mark before 2031. At that market capitalization, it could be more valuable than Ethereum. Can Avalanche reach $10,000? It remains highly unlikely that AVAX will cross the $10,000 mark before 2031. How much will Avalanche be worth in 2025? As the second half of 2025 unfolds, we anticipate it will trade between $19.06 and $33.36, with an average price of $29.46. Does Avalanche have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, AVAX will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or negative regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is Avalanche a good crypto to buy? Chart analysis suggests that Avalanche is recovering and currently gearing up for a closer move to $27 despite the overall bearish momentum.

Image source: CoinStats In July 2020, Avalanche completed its public sale, raising $42 million in less than $4.5 hours. The tokens were distributed after the mainnet launch in September. On Dec 31, 2020, it fell to an all-time low of $2.788. In September 2021, the Ava Labs Foundation received a $230 million investment from Polychain and Three Arrows Capital Group by purchasing the AVAX cryptocurrency. In November 2021, following an agreement with Deloitte to improve US disaster relief funding, AVAX moved to the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. At that time, AVAX moved to its all-time high at $146.22. In Aug 2022, a whistleblower, ‘crypto leaks’, published a report accusing Ava Labs of secret deals with a law firm to destabilize its competitors. Ava Labs CEO Emin Gün Sirer denied any dirty deal with Roche Freedmen law firm. In 2023, AVAX maintained a bullish trend between January and May, after which bears overwhelmed the market. It resumed the positive momentum in October, rising to $49.96 In 2024, it crossed the $60 mark in March. The rise coincided with a record high in AVAX inscriptions, with over 100 million ASC-20 minted since their introduction in June 2023. The uptrend reversed in April 2024; by July, it had fallen to $24.40. In August, it was at $21, and in September and October, it was at $27. It turned bullish in November 2024, rising from as low as $23 to as high as $55 in December. It later corrected and traded at $42 into 2025. The drop continued into January; by June, it had fallen below $20.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/avalanche-price-prediction/,"AVAX|TRADING|MARKET|ICO|BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY|FIL|REGULATION|BTC|BUSINESS","Crypto Price Predictions|avax",cryptocompare
2025-06-30T15:27:46,"Areta: Crypto M&A tops $40b in 2025 as buyers seek scale and speed","With over 40 billion-dollar deals closed this year, crypto mergers have surged past anything the market has seen before. Areta co-founders trace the forces pushing institutional buyers to pick “buy” over “build” at a record pace. At a June 30 conference session during ETHCC 8, Areta co-founders Karl-Martin Ahrend and Jan-Philip Grabs walked attendees through what they described as the most active year in crypto M&A history. Drawing from their advisory work with major players including Robinhood, Swift, and MoonPay, the duo outlined the seismic shift driving 2025’s unprecedented M&A boom, revealing how regulatory clarity and institutional FOMO have turned acquisitions into crypto’s dominant growth strategy. The numbers speak for themselves: this year’s deal volume has already eclipsed all previous years combined, with trading infrastructure, staking, payments, and on-chain deals leading the charge. You might also like: Strategy joins Russell Top 200 Value Index with $64b BTC on the books The four fronts driving crypto’s acquisition frenzy The breakneck pace of crypto M&A isn’t accidental. Behind the 40+ billion-dollar deals of 2025 lie four strategic battlegrounds where acquirers are fighting for dominance: Trading platforms have become prime targets, not for retail user bases, but for regulatory licenses and institutional infrastructure. When Robinhood acquired Bitstamp earlier this year, insiders saw it as a regulatory power play. The acquisition gave Robinhood instant access to dozens of jurisdictions and a turnkey institutional trading desk. Similar moves by Coinbase and Swift reflect a new reality: compliance capabilities are now the competitive moat in crypto’s regulated future. “You’ve seen Robinhood acquiring Bitstamp to increase their licensing footprint around the globe and also add institutional trading capabilities.” Karl-Martin Ahrend noted. Swift has acquired AZ crypto… to obviously consolidate user numbers and create significant synergies between the two businesses.” The quiet consolidation in staking services tells another part of the story. As proof-of-stake networks now secure the majority of crypto’s value, control over validation operations has emerged as a strategic imperative. Firms like Source Strategies are absorbing smaller validators, such as Solana-native players, to bring key operations in-house. The goal across the board is vertical control, faster deployment, and future-proofing in an increasingly competitive arena. At the same time, payment processors are racing to own the entire stablecoin value chain, from issuance to settlement. Stripe’s acquisition of Preview and MoonPay’s European shopping spree reveal a clear pattern: companies are internalizing every step of crypto payments to capture this booming market. With nearly 80% of crypto businesses now using stablecoins for B2B transactions, these moves represent bets on crypto’s future as a mainstream payment rail rather than just a speculative asset. Perhaps the most radical development is unfolding transparently on blockchain ledgers themselves. The rise of token-based acquisitions, like Enzyme’s all-token purchase of Microfinance, shows how decentralized organizations are rewriting the M&A playbook. But as Areta’s Jan-Philip Grabs noted during the presentation, “Unlike in more traditional M&A deals… you’re really lacking the clear framework and processes.” These on-chain mergers face unique challenges, from community governance hurdles to untested legal ground, yet they point toward a future where blockchain-native dealmaking becomes commonplace.

2025-06-30T15:25:09,"What Should Be the Percentage of Bitcoin (BTC) in Portfolios? Experienced Analyst Peter Brandt Reveals the Best BTC Strategy!","Experienced analyst Peter Brandt, who is followed by investors with his analyses of Bitcoin (BTC) and the cryptocurrency market, made a new post. Peter Brandt, who explains to investors how the ideal portfolio allocation should be with his 50 years of experience, argued that trading is the wrong path and choice for 95% of people. Brandt, who notes that some people need to focus on real-world skills rather than trading on screen or making quick profits, recommends monthly investment. Stating that people should focus on their daily lives at this point, the master analyst recommends investing 80% in S&P 500 and 20% in Bitcoin. Peter Brandt’s portfolio allocation is not a sign of an anti-Bitcoin stance. It is actually a clear sign that Brandt still sees BTC as an important part of his long-term portfolio strategy and values Bitcoin. Peter Brandt’s message here seems to be one of balance. While the analyst thinks Bitcoin is an ideal asset for making money in the long term, he argues that BTC should not be at the center of investments. Trading is the wrong path for 95% of ppl Most would be better off becoming excellent at a day job (engineer, plumber, welder, vet, sales) Live economically Get married, have kids Buy a twin home – rent out one of them Invest monthly – 80% in $SPY and 20% in Bitcoin — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) June 29, 2025 Peter Brant warned in an analysis he conducted last week that Bitcoin could form a double top pattern above $100,000 and experience a major crash. Brandt reminded that there is a potential for the formation of the double top pattern that Bitcoin followed in 2022 and resulted in a major 75% drop, and a 75% correction. According to the pattern, a double top at $ 110,000 was formed, and a low level of $ 75,000 was taken as the basis before the second peak was formed. In this context, according to the analyst, if BTC breaks below $ 75,000, this means that a double top pattern has formed and could lead to a 75% drop from the peak.

2025-06-30T15:19:43,"John Deaton Says Wall Street Greed Could Push XRP, ETH & SOL Into Treasuries","The post John Deaton Says Wall Street Greed Could Push XRP, ETH & SOL Into Treasuries appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Years ago, when John E Deaton, a well-known crypto advocate and legal voice in the XRP community, predicted that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and corporate crypto treasuries would expand beyond Bitcoin, many laughed! But today, those predictions are becoming reality—and fast. Now, again, Deaton says that Wall Street’s greed could make XRP, ETH, and SOL the next big treasury assets. Deaton’s “Greed Theory” Playing Out Deaton had one simple theory : Wall Street is too greedy to sit back and let only a few players profit from crypto. Earlier, Deaton said Wall Street would never let Michael Saylor be the only one using Bitcoin as a treasury strategy. According to Deaton, there are now between 60 and 100 companies that have implemented a Bitcoin treasury strategy. He believed the same would happen with other tokens too, once Bitcoin’s treasury strategy worked, others wanted in — and not just with Bitcoin. Meanwhile, companies are now adding ETH, XRP, and SOL to their corporate balance sheets to gain an edge. Who’s Holding XRP as a Treasury Asset? Deaton points out that at least five companies have already been betting on XRP’s treasury strategy : VivoPower International has raised $121 million for a $100 million XRP treasury plan, with strong backing from Saudi investors and advice from a former SBI Ripple Asia executive. Worksport Ltd., an American car parts company, set aside $5 million — or 10% of its spare cash — for XRP and Bitcoin. Hyperscale Data Inc. plans to launch an XRP lending platform by late 2025, listing XRP directly on its accounts. Webus International Limited , a Chinese company, partnered with Samara Alpha Management to manage a $300 million XRP treasury for cross-border payments. Wellgistics Health, Inc. uses XRP in its treasury to speed up payments in healthcare and avoid banking delays. It’s Not Just XRP — ETH and SOL Too Deaton pointed out that at least two companies now hold ETH as a treasury strategy, including Fundstrat and SharpLink Gaming, which has a $425 million ETH position supported by Consensys, Ethereum’s co-founder, Joseph Lubin’s company. For Solana, the list is growing too: Upexi raised $100 million for a Solana treasury. DeFi Development Corp saw its shares surge 3,000% after announcing SOL purchases. Sol Strategies has launched as a Solana treasury company, getting support from major firms like Cantor Fitzgerald. An unnamed EdTech company also plans to raise $500 million to hold SOL. Wall Street’s Hunger For Profit Meanwhile, Deaton said that this wasn’t just about XRP, Ethereum, or Solana—it was about understanding human behavior, the hunger for returns, and the inevitability of crypto adoption in corporate finance. As Deaton puts it, his predictions weren’t about specific cryptocurrencies, but about how people—and especially Wall Street—respond when they smell opportunity.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/john-deaton-says-wall-street-greed-could-push-xrp-eth-sol-into-treasuries/,"XRP|REGULATION|SOL|ETH|BTC","News",cryptocompare
