2025-06-30T18:56:33,"Why 2025 May Be the Year Crypto Finally ‘Grew Up’ in the Eyes of Wall Street","The year 2025 may well be remembered as the point where digital assets crossed a long-awaited threshold from speculative fringe to institutional mainstay. While crypto markets have seen waves of hype, collapse, and cautious optimism over the past decade, recent developments suggest the narrative is no longer about “if” institutions are coming, but “how fast.” From billion-dollar ETF inflows and public company accumulation to regulatory milestones and integration by traditional financial giants, crypto is experiencing an institutional maturation at a scale and pace that’s forcing even the most skeptical Wall Street veterans to take notice. ETF Inflows Signal Institutional Acceleration It began with numbers that were hard to ignore. Over an 11-day period in June, Bitcoin ETFs attracted $2.2 billion in inflows, marking the longest winning streak since their U.S. launch in January. Market leaders like BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund pulled in hundreds of millions in daily flows—an unmistakable sign that money managers were back in the market. Source: CoinShares report These aren’t retail-driven FOMO surges. Rather, they reflect pension funds, RIAs, and institutional allocators quietly but assertively expanding their crypto exposure as part of diversified portfolios. Metaplanet Joins the Big Leagues Beyond ETFs, corporations are also signaling intent through direct purchases. Japan’s Metaplanet made headlines this month by buying another 1,005 BTC , bringing its total to 13,350—enough to push it into the top five corporate Bitcoin holders globally, surpassing Tesla and Galaxy Digital. What’s more telling is how they’re financing it. Metaplanet issued traditional bonds to raise funds for their crypto play, reflecting a bridging of conventional capital markets with the decentralized world. The move was rewarded: Metaplanet’s stock surged 10% on the announcement, showing that equity investors, too, are warming to crypto-linked exposure. Legacy Finance Firms Are Getting Hands-On In parallel, some of the world’s most established financial players are actively building inroads into crypto infrastructure: Mastercard has teamed up with Fiserv to integrate a stablecoin (FIUSD) into its global payments ecosystem. The goal: make stablecoin spending as seamless as swiping a card—at over 150 million merchants. JPMorgan has launched JPMD , a deposit token that represents U.S. dollars on a blockchain. This isn’t a proof of concept—it’s already in limited use among institutional clients conducting cross-border settlements. Standard Chartered struck a partnership with FalconX to offer digital asset settlement services to hedge funds and sovereign wealth clients. This extends crypto’s reach deeper into the world of high-frequency, institutional-grade trading. The Market Responds As of June 30, Bitcoin trades around $107,800, rebounding from recent lows of $98,000. Ethereum has regained its $6,000 mark, and broader market sentiment is neutral to bullish. Analysts at Galaxy and Bernstein suggest that should ETF inflows continue at current pace, Bitcoin could test the $120,000 level before Q4. In essence, 2025 may not be remembered for fireworks but for foundations. The explosive rallies and brutal crashes of prior years are being replaced by something subtler and, perhaps, more powerful: institutional consistency. A New Era for Communications Strategy As institutional capital flows in, so does the need for sharper storytelling. In a world no longer driven by hype alone, narrative precision is becoming a competitive advantage. That’s where crypto-native PR firms like Outset PR come into play.

Data from CoinGlass revealed concentrated trading interest around key price levels, with substantial bid activity below current prices and resistance clustering above $109,000 . Over $48.7 million in liquidity was positioned at $109,500 . If Bitcoin successfully breaks through liquidity levels between $110,000 and $112,300 , the resulting short squeeze could push the cryptocurrency back into price discovery mode, potentially setting new record highs.

2025-06-30T18:45:16,"Wedbush’s Dan Ives Says Tech Bull Market Just Starting, Predicts ‘Very Strong Second Half’ of Year – Here’s His Top Picks","The managing director of the financial services firm Wedbush Securities is expecting solid gains from tech stocks in the second half of the year. During an interview on Bloomberg’s The Close, Dan Ives says the stocks of the technology titans Nvidia and Microsoft will provide significant returns later this year as artificial intelligence (AI) continues to gain momentum. “This is just starting in terms of this next stage of the AI revolution. I think as we go into the software phase, you see on the consumer side, when it comes to AI, I believe this is still the bottom of the first, top of the second inning. That’s why Nvidia, $4 trillion, ultimately [will be] $5 trillion. Microsoft, we think is on the road to $4 trillion and then $5 trillion. It’s our view that this tech bull market… Get the popcorn out, I think it’s going to be a very strong second half.” He also shares his thoughts on Uber amid reports that the transportation service company is negotiating with its former CEO, Travis Kalanick, to potentially fund the acquisition of the US arm of the Chinese autonomous vehicle company Pony AI. “When you look at the next phase, when it comes to physical AI, it’s about autonomous and Uber… Uber needs to definitely focus on partnerships and expanding their repertoire when it comes to autonomous. This would be a smart, strategic move, aggressive if they did it.” Ives says he is generally optimistic about the tech sector, including older companies like IBM. “I think that’s going to be the next chapter when it comes to AI, but it speaks broadly to our view of tech, from robotics to autonomous to enterprise to consumer AI. Across the board, I mean, this is, I believe, a golden age for tech.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-30T18:41:30,"Morgan Stanley Predicts S&P 500 Rally, Says Three Catalysts To Drive Next Leg Up: Report","Morgan Stanley chief investment officer Mike Wilson is reportedly predicting that US stocks are not done rallying in 2025. Wilson says in a note to investors that the S&P 500 will likely continue putting up gains for the remainder of the year, reports Investing.com. He believes that the Federal Reserve will cut rates, adding liquidity to the market, and company earnings will exceed expectations, sending stocks higher. “Equity markets have been resilient since bottoming in April, and the rally has been more fundamentally driven than many appreciate… We remain bullish on a six-to-12-month horizon as EPS (earnings per share) tailwinds expand, and the market has line of sight to Fed cuts.” Wilson says a third catalyst behind a likely continued stock market rally is the decline in broader policy and geopolitical risks. One metric Wilson uses to predict a bullish market is the earnings revisions breadth, or the proportion of analysts who have raised their estimates minus the proportion who have lowered them. The earnings revisions breadth has increased from a low of -25% in April to -5% currently, providing “fundamental justification” for equity growth, Wilson says. He adds that similar changes in the past have resulted in stronger earnings. “This series leads EPS surprise.” Wilson also says that stocks will likely trade higher ahead of expected Fed rate cuts later this year.

2025-06-30T18:41:13,"Coinsilium Bitcoin: Strategic Boost Unveils Massive 73 BTC Holdings","BitcoinWorld Coinsilium Bitcoin: Strategic Boost Unveils Massive 73 BTC Holdings The world of digital assets is constantly evolving, and a significant move by a prominent player often signals deeper trends within the market. Recently, the Web3 investment and advisory firm, Coinsilium, made headlines with a strategic expansion of its Bitcoin reserves. This isn’t just a minor acquisition; it’s a bold statement, as the company announced via X (formerly Twitter) that it acquired an additional 15.4147 BTC, elevating its total Coinsilium Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 73.7304 BTC. What drives such a decision, and what does it tell us about the broader landscape of institutional engagement with cryptocurrencies? Understanding Coinsilium’s Strategic Bitcoin Holdings Expansion Coinsilium is not new to the Web3 space. As an investment and advisory firm, it has been at the forefront of identifying and supporting innovative projects within the decentralized ecosystem. Their latest move to significantly increase their Bitcoin holdings underscores a growing confidence not just in Bitcoin itself, but in the long-term viability and potential of the entire digital asset market. This isn’t merely about holding a digital asset; it’s about a calculated treasury management strategy. Let’s break down the significance of this acquisition: Increased Exposure: By adding over 15 BTC, Coinsilium substantially increases its direct exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements, signaling a bullish outlook on the leading cryptocurrency. Treasury Management: For a Web3 firm, holding a significant portion of its reserves in Bitcoin can be seen as a hedge against inflation and a strategic allocation of capital that aligns with their core business ethos. Market Confidence: Such an announcement from a publicly active firm can instill confidence among investors, highlighting Bitcoin’s role as a legitimate store of value and a viable asset class for corporate treasuries. Why Are Companies Increasing Their Bitcoin Holdings? Coinsilium’s move is part of a larger trend observed among various corporations, both within and outside the crypto native space. The motivations behind accumulating substantial Bitcoin holdings are multifaceted, often driven by macroeconomic factors, a search for alternative stores of value, and the recognition of Bitcoin’s unique properties. Here are some key reasons why companies are bolstering their Bitcoin reserves: Reason Explanation Inflation Hedge In an era of quantitative easing and rising inflation concerns, Bitcoin’s fixed supply (21 million coins) makes it an attractive asset to preserve purchasing power, often referred to as ‘digital gold’. Diversification Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury or investment portfolio can offer diversification away from traditional assets like fiat currencies, bonds, and equities, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Growth Potential Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has demonstrated significant long-term growth potential, making it an appealing asset for companies looking to grow their capital reserves. Technological Alignment For Web3 and tech-forward companies, holding Bitcoin aligns with their vision of a decentralized, digitally-native future. It demonstrates a commitment to the ecosystem they operate within. First-Mover Advantage Early adopters believe they can gain a competitive edge by familiarizing themselves with digital assets and blockchain technology before mainstream adoption fully takes hold. Companies like MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, have famously adopted a Bitcoin-centric treasury strategy, accumulating vast amounts of BTC. While not every company will follow such an aggressive approach, Coinsilium’s actions indicate a growing comfort level and strategic consideration of Bitcoin as a core treasury asset. The Role of Web3 Investment Firms in Crypto Adoption Web3 investment firms like Coinsilium play a pivotal role in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the nascent, yet rapidly expanding, decentralized web. Their expertise lies not just in capital allocation, but also in understanding the intricate technological and market dynamics of blockchain, NFTs, DeFi, and other Web3 innovations. Their contributions to crypto adoption extend beyond just investing their own capital: Incubating Innovation: They often provide early-stage funding and mentorship to promising Web3 startups, helping them navigate the complex regulatory and technical landscapes. Advisory Services: Many offer strategic advice to enterprises looking to integrate blockchain technology or enter the crypto space, helping to de-risk and streamline their entry. Market Validation: When a respected Web3 firm makes a significant investment in a core asset like Bitcoin, it sends a strong signal of validation to the broader market, encouraging other institutions to consider similar moves. Ecosystem Building: By participating actively in governance, development, and community initiatives, they contribute to the overall health and growth of the Web3 ecosystem. Coinsilium’s increased Bitcoin allocation can also be seen as a demonstration of their belief in the foundational layer of the entire Web3 stack. Bitcoin, as the original decentralized network, underpins much of the philosophical and technological innovation seen in Web3. What Does This Mean for Institutional Crypto Adoption? The consistent increase in corporate and institutional Bitcoin holdings , exemplified by Coinsilium, is a strong indicator of maturing interest and confidence in the digital asset space. For years, Bitcoin was largely a retail phenomenon, but that narrative is rapidly shifting. The path to widespread institutional crypto adoption is paved by several factors: Regulatory Clarity: As more jurisdictions develop clearer frameworks for digital assets, institutions feel more secure in their investments. Improved Infrastructure: The development of robust custody solutions, regulated exchanges, and derivatives markets makes it easier and safer for large entities to engage with crypto. Performance Track Record: Despite volatility, Bitcoin’s long-term performance has caught the attention of traditional finance, prompting a re-evaluation of its role in diversified portfolios. Peer Influence: As more prominent firms like Coinsilium, MicroStrategy, and even asset managers like BlackRock (with their spot Bitcoin ETF) enter the space, it creates a domino effect, encouraging others not to be left behind. Coinsilium’s move, while specific to their treasury, contributes to the growing narrative that Bitcoin is not just a speculative asset but a legitimate component of a forward-thinking institutional investment strategy. It helps normalize the idea of holding significant crypto assets on a balance sheet. Crafting a Robust Crypto Portfolio Strategy Whether you’re an individual investor or a corporate entity, Coinsilium’s strategic move offers valuable lessons on approaching a crypto portfolio strategy . It highlights the importance of conviction, long-term vision, and understanding the underlying assets. Here are some actionable insights for developing your own crypto investment approach: Define Your Objectives: Are you looking for long-term capital appreciation, diversification, or short-term gains? Your goals will dictate your asset allocation. Understand the Assets: Don’t just buy what’s popular. Research Bitcoin’s fundamentals, its scarcity, network effects, and its role in the broader crypto ecosystem. Understand the difference between Bitcoin and altcoins. Start with Core Holdings: Many strategists suggest a foundation in Bitcoin and Ethereum, given their market dominance and network security, before exploring more volatile altcoins. Diversify Wisely: While Bitcoin is a strong foundation, a diversified portfolio might include exposure to different sectors within Web3, such as DeFi, NFTs, or specific Layer 1/Layer 2 solutions, depending on your risk tolerance. Risk Management is Key: Crypto markets are volatile. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Consider dollar-cost averaging to mitigate price fluctuations. Secure Your Assets: Prioritize security. Use hardware wallets for significant holdings and practice strong password hygiene. Stay Informed: The crypto space evolves rapidly. Keep up with news, regulatory changes, and technological advancements. Coinsilium’s decision to increase its Bitcoin allocation is a testament to a well-thought-out strategy that likely balances potential returns with a long-term outlook on digital assets. It’s not about chasing short-term pumps, but about building a resilient and future-proof treasury. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards a Decentralized Future Coinsilium’s substantial increase in its Bitcoin holdings to over 73 BTC is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a powerful affirmation of Bitcoin’s enduring value and the growing confidence among sophisticated Web3 firms. This strategic move not only strengthens Coinsilium’s own financial position but also contributes significantly to the broader narrative of institutional crypto adoption . It serves as a compelling example for other corporations considering their entry into the digital asset space, highlighting Bitcoin’s role as a robust and strategic treasury asset in an increasingly digital world. As the Web3 landscape continues to mature, we can expect more such decisive actions from pioneering firms, further cementing cryptocurrencies as an integral part of the global financial future.

2025-06-30T18:17:29,"Aptos founder joins BlackRock, Goldman Sachs in shaping CFTC crypto’s rulebook","Avery Ching isn’t just shipping code anymore. The Aptos co-founder and CEO has been appointed to the CFTC’s digital asset panel, signaling a new era where those who build the infrastructure help shape its regulation. On June 30, Aptos Labs announced that its co-founder and CEO, Avery Ching, was appointed to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s Digital Asset Markets Subcommittee. • @wyostable has placed Aptos as the highest-scoring blockchain candidate for WYST—the first fiat-backed stablecoin issued by a U.S. State. • @BitwiseInvest recently filed an amendment to the Aptos ETF, moving one step closer toward the offering of an ETF linked to Aptos in the… — Aptos (@Aptos) June 30, 2025 The group, part of the CFTC’s Global Markets Advisory Committee, includes heavyweights from BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, and Citadel, alongside key crypto industry figures like Polygon Labs’ Rebecca Rettig and CoinFund’s Christopher Perkins. According to Aptos, Ching will represent the builder’s perspective in a policy environment still largely shaped by legal and financial incumbents. His appointment suggests that the CFTC is actively seeking input from technologists who understand blockchain’s complexities, not just financial institutions adapting to its disruption. Why Ching’s CFTC role could reshape crypto’s regulatory playbook Avery Ching’s appointment comes at a pivotal moment for crypto regulation. While the SEC keeps swinging its enforcement hammer, the CFTC has been playing a different game. The commodities regulator has steadily expanded its crypto oversight with a lighter touch, especially when it comes to assets like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ). With Ching now advising its Digital Asset Markets Subcommittee, the agency gains direct access to a technologist who has built blockchain infrastructure at scale. Ching’s background sets him apart from traditional finance appointees. Before co-founding Aptos, he was a principal engineer at Meta’s Diem project (formerly Libra), where he grappled with the regulatory hurdles of launching a global stablecoin. That experience gives him rare insight into both the technical and compliance challenges facing decentralized systems. On the CFTC subcommittee, Ching will work alongside figures like Nasdaq’s Tony Sio and Franklin Templeton’s Sandy Kaul, bridging the gap between crypto’s disruptors and Wall Street’s established players. Aptos’ quiet regulatory wins While Ching’s appointment is new, Aptos has been laying groundwork for regulatory relevance. The project was recently named the top blockchain candidate for Wyoming’s WYST, the first fiat-backed stablecoin issued by a U.S. state. At the same time, Bitwise’s amended filing for an Aptos-linked ETF signals growing institutional interest, even as the SEC delays decisions on broader crypto ETFs. This is not to mention that the Layer 1 blockchain already hosts three USD-pegged stablecoins, a factor that likely caught regulators’ attention given ongoing debates about stablecoin oversight. Ching’s first test may be the subcommittee’s work on stablecoin and CBDC frameworks, which it began standardizing in March 2024. With Wyoming’s WYST initiative and Aptos’ ETF prospects, his input could directly influence how regulators treat blockchain-native financial instruments.",crypto_news,https://crypto.news/aptos-founder-joins-blackrock-goldman-sachs-in-shaping-cftc-cryptos-rulebook/,"APT|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|BTC","News|Aptos|CFTC|Regulation",cryptocompare
2025-06-30T18:15:24,"Retail Bets Big on BTC While ETH Floods Binance – What It Means for Crypto’s Next Move","There have been diverging signals across crypto markets and US politics. Ethereum (ETH) deposits to Binance have continued for five consecutive days. In Bitcoin, the Short-Term Holder (STH) Net Position Realized Cap has surged from over negative $49 billion to more than $5 billion. Such a trend reflects aggressive accumulation by retail traders seeking exposure during the ongoing rally. Will Crypto Rally or Reverse? According to the latest report by CryptoQuant, in previous cycles, rising short-term holder activity has often occurred near market tops. Retail buyers tend to enter aggressively during these strong rallies, thereby creating concerns about markets becoming overheated. On the political front, US President Donald Trump announced that Senate Republicans are finalizing what he described as “ONE, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL.” It pledged sweeping tax cuts, including the elimination of taxes on tips, overtime, and seniors’ Social Security income, while promising increased military spending and domestic job creation. Trump urged Congress to pass the bill before July 4, and framed it as a marker of American economic resilience. If enacted, these measures could inject additional disposable income into households, potentially lifting short-term consumer spending. However, Elon Musk expressed concern the following day, and even warned that unfunded tax cuts risk worsening the federal budget deficit. CryptoQuant analyst noted that while short-term economic activity may rise, the long-term risks of increasing deficits could push the US toward unsustainable debt levels and higher interest obligations. Investor sentiment remains influenced by broader geopolitical tensions across global markets. Traders are monitoring whether increased retail buying alongside macroeconomic developments could point to an approaching crypto market top or drive a rotation into defensive allocations, including stablecoins, government bonds, and perceived safe-haven assets. Bitcoin’s Quiet Push Higher Amid these signals of retail-driven momentum and macroeconomic uncertainty, Matrixport offers a different lens on Bitcoin’s quiet positioning near resistance levels. The leading crypto asset has been observed to be “quietly” testing resistance levels even as US equities reach new all-time highs and ETF inflows remain strong. Despite these supportive conditions, Bitcoin’s upside volatility has stayed muted, a pattern often seen during the summer months when markets consolidate. However, expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve are building, and traders are increasingly anticipating rate cuts as policymakers debate the longer-term effects of tariff-driven inflation. As per the report, traders may begin to look beyond the stop-start nature of tariff negotiations and follow equities, where robust retail buying has fueled record highs. Matrixport reiterated its stance that spillover from Wall Street, particularly through Bitcoin ETFs, could become a critical factor for Bitcoin’s next upward move. Meanwhile, the US dollar index (DXY) has dropped nearly 12% this year, which happens to be its worst showing in 40 years, amid Fed rate-cut expectations and rising debt concerns. Analysts suggest this weakening dollar could drive Bitcoin higher, echoing past cycles where the crypto asset surged during periods of significant dollar devaluation.

According to a Robinhood announcement , the retail trading app has launched US stock and exchange-traded fund (ETF) tokens in the EU. The stock tokens will be issued on the Ethereum ( ETH ) layer-2 blockchain Arbitrum ( ARB ). Robinhood also announced plans to build its proprietary layer-2 on Arbitrum. Says GM and SVP of Robinhood Crypto Johann Kerbra, “Crypto was built by engineers for engineers, and has not been accessible to most people. We’re onboarding the world to crypto by making it as easy to use as possible—with the goal of bringing powerful tools into one intuitive platform.” In addition, the trading app giant is introducing perpetual crypto futures in the EU, as well as crypto staking in both the EU and the US. Comments Robinhood Chairman and CEO Vlad Tenev, “Our latest offerings lay the groundwork for crypto to become the backbone of the global financial system.” Last week, Robinhood announced it was rolling out micro-futures for Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other top crypto assets. In a podcast interview last year, Tenev said that Robinhood has ambitions to play a role in the merging of AI and wealth management. “I think there’s two big technology trends that could affect financial services. One is crypto, the other is AI. And Robinhood will be a leader in both. I mean we’re already a leader in crypto, and we’re making lots and lots of investments to make sure we’re the leader in AI. I don’t think the competition is particularly formidable, but I also think that’s not an excuse to get complacent, so yes, I do think we’re going to be doing a lot. And we also, just recently, announced an acquisition of Pluto, which – it’s basically an AI-based investment research product, so you can put in information about companies and investments.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The SMA-14 level suggests downward volatility in the next few hours. Stepn/USDT 4-hour price chart: Bearish dominance surges around EMA trendlines The 4-hour Stepn price chart suggests GMT continues to experience bearish activity near EMA lines, creating a negative sentiment on the price chart.

However, if the Stepn price successfully breaks above $0.0467, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.0526. GMT price chart If bulls cannot initiate a surge, Stepn price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.0407, resulting in a correction to $0.0374. Is Stepn A Good Investment? It’s difficult to predict the future of the GMT token, which has recently rebounded from a low point, but it’s uncertain how long this recovery will last or how far it will go. While StepN offers a valuable service, it hasn’t fully gained traction within the broader crypto community, and it remains to be seen how the platform will captivate a larger audience. As with any crypto investment, it’s crucial to conduct thorough research before making a decision to invest in GMT. Why is the GMT Price Up Today? Following Bitcoin’s surge toward the $108K level, GMT gained its momentum, resulting in a surge toward $0.044. Will GMT Price Reach $100? GMT price might soon reach the $100 mark in 2040 if the buying demand continues to surge and Stepn attracts altcoin investors. Will GMT Price Reach $1000? Due to the effort of the community, Stepn Coin’s prices will continue to increase. However, there is currently no indication that the Stepn (GMT) Coin will reach $1000 in the near future, which is a long-term target. Is GMT a Good Long-Term Investment? GMT has gained popularity thanks to strong community support. However, it’s crucial to conduct thorough research into their long-term potential to determine if it represents a viable long-term investment. Recent GMT News/Opinions STEPN developer Find Satoshi Lab has introduced its payment solution GMT Pay, which allows users to spend their web3 earnings for everyday payments. GMT Price Prediction July 2025 Over the last few days, GMT coin price has been on a downward trend and it aims to drop below crucial Fib levels.

Details of the transaction indicate that the country transferred 137.245 BTC, valued at approximately $14.77 million, to the exchange on June 30, according to the latest on-chain data obtained by Finbold from Arkham Intelligence. Kingdom of Bhutan Bitcoin transaction. Source: Arkham The potential for a sale comes as the Asian nation’s Bitcoin stash has grown significantly. As of press time, Bhutan holds 11,924 BTC, valued at approximately $1.28 billion. Notably, these holdings have been built mainly through state-supported mining operations controlled by Druk Holding and Investments. Currently, there is no official explanation for the Binance deposit; however, historically, moving funds to exchanges often signals plans to sell. Impact of Bhutan’s possible Bitcoin sale Offloading a large amount could introduce short-term volatility for Bitcoin, especially as the cryptocurrency is at a critical point where it may face a correction after repeated rejections near the $110,000 level. By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $107,636. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Notably, Bhutan is among the few countries, alongside El Salvador, that have been strategically accumulating Bitcoin. On the other hand, El Salvador has made Bitcoin legal tender and follows a “no-sell” strategy of periodic buying. In contrast, most government-held Bitcoin originates from criminal seizures, with the United States holding the largest share, mainly due to the Silk Road case. Meanwhile, the Himalayan nation is working to grow its crypto ecosystem beyond mining. For example, at the recent Digital Bhutan panel co-hosted with Binance, officials outlined plans to integrate cryptocurrency into everyday life. Building on the May 2025 launch of a crypto-backed tourism payment system developed with Binance and DK Bank, the platform uses Bhutan’s Bitcoin reserves to enable over 100 cryptocurrencies to be spent fee-free at more than 1,000 merchants via Binance Pay.

U.S. stock indices are up on positive developments in trade and taxes. On Monday, June 30, Dow Jones was up 171 points or 0.39%, the S&P 500 was up 0.28%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq was up 0.27%. Dow Jones Industrial Average heatmap | Source: TipRanks President Donald Trump signalled that trade talks with major trading partners are going forward at a good pace. On Sunday, June 29, Trump stated that he doesn’t expect he will need to extend the July 9 deadline on trade negotiations. The deadline, which Trump implemented earlier, is when the 25% tariffs on most of the U.S. trading partners kick back in. However, he did signal that the White House could do anything it wanted, either extending the deadline or even shortening it.

Earlier, Canada agreed to remove its digital services tax, which would apply to U.S. tech firms. Once the tax is removed, the U.S. will get back to the negotiations immediately, the White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett stated. The U.S. trade war has put major pressure on U.S. stocks, as investors are concerned about the impact it might have on inflation and growth.

2025-06-30T17:36:39,"Bitcoin stalls below $108K as long term holders sell, ARB, AERO, PYTH led altcoins","Bitcoin drifted sideways during Monday’s Asian session, showing little ambition to break free from its narrow trading range as the market treaded cautiously with a hint of optimism. Across the broader crypto landscape, the total market capitalisation shed around 2.5%, with most of the pain felt in the altcoin space. Market sentiment, however, hadn’t turned sour just yet. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index remained in “Greed” territory, though it dipped two points to 66, hinting at a touch of hesitation creeping in. Why is Bitcoin price stuck? Bitcoin traded within a tight range between $106,951 and $108,771 throughout the day as long-term holders continued to exert selling pressure, effectively capping upward momentum despite a surge of institutional interest. Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards attributed the recent slowdown to long-term holders, who have been offloading their positions since the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. “People are wondering why Bitcoin has been stuck at $100K so long, despite the institutional FOMO,” he said in a Sunday X post, explaining that recent buyer inflows are being absorbed by these early holders exiting the market. According to Edwards, Bitcoin’s holder profile is shifting, as six-month holders, mainly new entrants like corporate treasuries, are gaining ground. In just two months, this group has reportedly absorbed almost all the BTC that long-term holders have been unloading for the past 18 months. Rental traders were also booking profits ahead of the July 9 tariff deadline, wary of unresolved trade issues between the US and key trading partners that could rattle global markets. The looming deadline marks the potential implementation of reciprocal tariffs, adding pressure to risk assets across equities and crypto. Further caution stemmed from the anticipation of key macroeconomic updates out of the US this week. Simultaneously, market participants are closely watching progress on developments surrounding President Trump’s proposed budget bill, which includes controversial spending cuts and tax reforms. Investors remain on edge, as any unexpected shifts in fiscal or trade policy could trigger a broader risk-off move, prompting capital to flow out of riskier assets like cryptocurrencies and into safer havens. What’s next for Bitcoin? Despite the broader dip in risk appetite, some traders remain convinced that a breakout to fresh all-time highs is only a matter of time. Bitcoin’s price has remained stuck below $108,000 since falling under that threshold on June 11, and market watchers say the key battleground lies just above. Price activity over the past 24 hours shows repeated attempts to build a base around $106,000–$107,000, with strong buy interest absorbing downside pressure. Meanwhile, significant ask-side interest continues to stack up around $109,000 and stretches as high as $113,000, suggesting a potential squeeze scenario if upward momentum returns. “Bitcoin is pushing into the $109,000 liquidity this morning as mentioned last night. The question is, will it have enough to push on through and hold?” crypto analyst AlphaBTC said in a Monday X post. As of press time, Coinglass data shows Bitcoin grinding through high-risk zones near $108,000.

Some bullish momentum may also come from the monthly and quarterly candle closes, both of which are now drawing attention. Bitcoin looks set to close June in the green, despite headline-driven volatility that kept traders on edge throughout the month. According to data from CoinGlass, BTC is on track for a 30% gain for Q2 2025, an impressive quarterly performance that many traders believe could act as a launchpad for renewed upside. A green June close, paired with a strong quarterly candle, is fuelling confidence that Bitcoin’s current consolidation is a pause rather than a local top. When writing, Bitcoin was hovering around $107,517, down 0.2% in the past day. Top altcoin gainers The altcoin market in the past 24 hours rose 2.3% to an intraday high of $1.32 trillion before ending the day 1.3% lower at $1.28 trillion. This came as the Altcoin Season Index reading fell to 19. Ethereum, the largest altcoin by market cap, dipped slightly over the day, trading at a little above $2.400 as of press time. Other large-cap altcoins like Solana (SOL), Tron (TRX), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Cardano (ADA) also recorded slight gains while XRP (XRP) remained relatively flat for the day. Arbitrum (ARB) led daily gains among the top 99 altcoins with 14.5% gains, while Aerodrome Finance (AERO) and Pyth Network (PYTH) followed with gains of 6.1% and 5% respectively. Source: CoinMarketCap ARB’s price shot up today as rumors of a potential partnership with popular retail trading platform Robinhood saw renewed momentum on news that a key official from Offchain Labs, the team behind Arbitrum, would join Robinhood’s crypto GM at a panel during an event hosted by Robinhood Europe in Cannes. Traders are likely expecting the project to confirm the partnership. Meanwhile, AERO rallied after the Aerodome developers teased a major announcement set to be unveiled later this week. As for PYTH, today’s gains were triggered after Keyring Network, in collaboration with Euler Finance, Multipli, and Pyth Network, announced the launch of zkVerified markets on Avalanche. Traders responded positively to the development, viewing it as a major step toward bridging institutional capital with DeFi in a privacy-preserving way. With Pyth supplying real-time price feeds for the new markets, demand for its oracle services is expected to rise.

2025-06-30T17:30:32,"Bitcoin Price At $145,000 In September? Bullish Dojis Suggest Upward Move","Crypto analyst Stockmoney Lizards has provided an update on the current Bitcoin price action, predicting that the flagship crypto could reach as high $145,000 later this year. The analyst alluded to a doji pattern, which supports this bullish prediction. Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price Rally To $145,000 In an X post, Stockmoney Lizards stated that his mid-term target for the Bitcoin price is between $135,000 and $145,000. He expects BTC to reach these targets between September and October later this year. The analyst also touched on the current price action and why he believes the flagship crypto will reach such lofty heights. Related Reading: Extended Wave 5 Scenario Puts Bitcoin Price Above $300,000 With Step-Like Structure In Place Stockmoney noted that the Bitcoin price is trading at the upper level of the corrective channel, forming some dojis at this level. He admitted that he doesn’t know how many bounces market participants will see from BTC and what levels the crypto will test. He raised the possibility that the local bottom may be in and also that BTC could retest the $90,000 to $94,000 range. The analyst stated that if he had to bet, he would probably predict that the Bitcoin price taps the high of the $90,000 range again. BTC had dropped to as low as $98,000 last week amid the escalated tensions between Israel and Iran. Bitcoin has since recovered following the ceasefire between both countries. Stockmoney affirmed that the latest Bitcoin price action is a bullish formation as the flagship crypto has had an impulsive move up. He added that the current price action is not the usual money rotation with old traders selling and new traders loading up at range lows. The analyst also indicated that BTC’s rally isn’t driven by the derivatives market either. BTC To At Least Reach $135,000 Crypto analyst Titan of Crypto has echoed Stockmoney’s prediction that the Bitcoin price could at least reach $135,000. In an X post, the analyst declared that BTC’s path to this price target remains intact. He stated that Bitcoin is now challenging the first Fibonacci extension at $107,000 after breaking out and retesting key levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullishness For Q3 Grows: What Happens In Every Post-Halving Year? Once the Bitcoin price clears this Fibonacci extension, Titan of Crypto believes that the next stop is $135,000. He revealed that the market structure supports this move, but it remains to be seen if momentum will follow. His accompanying chart showed that BTC could reach this Fibonacci extension at $135,000 by September, aligning with Stockmoney’s prediction. The chart also suggested that BTC could still rally to as high as $150,000 at some point.

According to a post on X , the recent purchase cost approximately $531.9 million, with an average price of $106,801 per Bitcoin. Strategy’s BTC Acquisition is Not Ending Soon Interestingly, Strategy’s recent acquisition has increased its total Bitcoin holdings to 597,325 BTC, valued at around $42.4 billion. The company’s average purchase price for all its Bitcoins now is $70,982 each. With these numbers, Strategy is the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin worldwide. Notably, the business intelligence software firm’s year-to-date Bitcoin gain has increased to 85,871 BTC, which is worth about $9.5 billion. This shows the company’s strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value. It is worth noting that the funding for this purchase came from several sources, including the sale of Class A common stock, MSTR, perpetual preferred stock, STRK, and Strife preferred stock. This approach to financing highlights Strategy’s commitment to holding Bitcoin as a key part of its treasury reserve. Michael Saylor also hinted at a new purchase. In a recent update about his company’s Bitcoin investments, he said, “In 21 years, you’ll wish you’d bought more.” He repeated this idea in his recent speech , predicting that Bitcoin could reach a value of $21 million per coin in 21 years. Strategy Accused of Misleading Bitcoin Statements Meanwhile, Strategy has become the subject of discussion among several firms, with a number of them bringing lawsuits against the BTC behemoth. As reported by TheCoinRise, five law firms filed identical class action lawsuits against Strategy . The prosecutors have charged the firm with securities fraud related to the Bitcoin treasury it has built over the past five years. They accused the firm of making misleading investment statements, including some about Bitcoin and Strategy’s business, operations, and prospects. Additionally, a Strategy has been outlined for mitigating the various risks associated with Bitcoin’s volatility. These firms are seeking to recover damages from Strategy. Michael Saylor Hints at More BTC Buys However, Michael Saylor has recently hinted at a potential acquisition of Bitcoin . Saylor posted a chart on X displaying his firm’s historic Bitcoin purchases, accompanied by the cryptic caption: “Nothing Stops This Orange.” The statement echoes similar past posts that preceded major Bitcoin buys. Likewise, the post comes amid legal troubles for Saylor and Strategy’s top leadership. Despite the legal headwinds, Saylor’s continued bullish stance suggests that the company will continue to expand its Bitcoin treasury. Recall that the firm purchased 245 Bitcoins approximately $26 million , at an average price of $105,856 per coin.

2025-06-30T17:00:59,"Bitcoin Realized Supply Ratio Signals Equilibrium – Similar To Pre-Rally Levels In Late 2024","Bitcoin has been attempting to break above the critical $109,000 level since last week but continues to face stiff resistance. Despite multiple intraday pushes, bulls have been unable to secure a decisive close above this key zone, keeping the market in a state of suspense. While BTC remains firmly above the psychological $100,000 mark, the longer it fails to reclaim $109K and move into price discovery, the greater the risk that bullish momentum could start to fade. For now, buyers are still holding strong, defending support levels and keeping the uptrend structure intact. However, without a confirmed breakout, traders are becoming increasingly cautious. A clean move into new all-time highs would likely trigger renewed capital inflows and broader market confidence, but until that happens, Bitcoin remains at a crossroads. Supporting this uncertain outlook is fresh data from CryptoQuant, which shows that BTC is currently trading just above its annual Realized Price ratio level. This suggests that Bitcoin is neither significantly overbought nor oversold, placing the market in a neutral zone. Historically, such positioning has often preceded major directional moves , making the coming days critical in determining whether BTC breaks higher or loses momentum. Bitcoin Metrics Signal Market Neutrality Bitcoin has been in a consolidation phase since early May, maintaining a firm position above the $100,000 level despite several attempts by bears to break it. The only significant dip below this psychological threshold occurred on June 22, and even then, BTC quickly recovered within hours. This resilience highlights the strength of buyer interest at six-figure levels. However, while bulls have successfully defended support, they’ve been unable to push past the critical $110,000 resistance, leading to growing speculation that a correction may be looming. Adding valuable context to this uncertainty, top analyst Axel Adler shared insights into the Bitcoin Distribution by Realized Supply metric—a tool used to assess how expensive BTC is relative to what investors actually paid for it. Realized Supply calculates the total dollar value of all Bitcoin based on the prices at which coins last moved, offering a more grounded view of valuation. The metric’s ratio, defined as BTC Price / Realized Supply, functions similarly to the P/E ratio in equities. A high ratio can suggest overvaluation, while a low one implies potential undervaluation. Currently, Bitcoin’s price is just slightly above the annual ratio level, putting it in a neutral valuation zone. Interestingly, this is the same setup seen in November 2024, right before BTC surged from $74K to $107K. This suggests the market is neither overheated nor undervalued, positioning Bitcoin in a balanced zone where major moves could develop in either direction. As long as BTC remains in this range without a clear breakout or breakdown, traders should stay alert—this phase could be the calm before the next big shift. BTC Faces Rejection At $109K As Price Consolidates Bitcoin is currently trading at $107,531 on the 12-hour chart, showing signs of consolidation just below the critical resistance zone at $109,300. This level has acted as a ceiling for over a month, with multiple failed breakout attempts. The latest rejection from this level reflects the ongoing struggle between bulls and bears, as neither side has been able to confirm a decisive move. Despite the rejection, the overall structure remains bullish. BTC continues to hold above all key moving averages—50 SMA ($105,923), 100 SMA ($105,942), and 200 SMA ($97,290)—with the 50 and 100 SMAs converging as dynamic support around the $106K level. This alignment favors bullish continuation if buyers can maintain pressure. Volume has yet to show a convincing surge, indicating that traders are still waiting for confirmation before fully committing to new positions. A strong candle close above $109,300 would likely trigger upside momentum and shift BTC into price discovery. On the flip side, a drop below $105,000 would put the $103,600 support at risk and open the door to a broader pullback.

Table of Contents BTC and ETH post best Q2 since 2020 Spot ETF volumes bounce back Crypto’s institutional reframing Macro will decide the next move BTC and ETH post best Q2 since 2020 Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) are ending the second quarter of 2025 with strong momentum, recording quarterly gains of 30% and 36% respectively, according to CoinGlass data . These are the best Q2 returns for both assets since the post-COVID rally in 2020. BTC and ETH quarterly gains | Source: CoinGlass As of Jun. 30, Bitcoin is trading near $107,500 and Ethereum is holding around $2,450. On a weekly basis, they are up 6% and 9%, underpinning the broader upward trend that has taken shape over the past few weeks. The first quarter of 2025 had started on a much weaker note. Bitcoin fell 11.82% in Q1, giving back part of its massive 47.73% rally in the final quarter of 2024. Ethereum dropped even more sharply, ending Q1 with a 45.41% loss, marking its worst quarterly performance since the 2022 bear market. Trade tensions under the Trump administration, along with renewed geopolitical instability in Europe and the Middle East, created a risk-off environment that pulled capital away from speculative assets, including crypto. The turnaround in Q2 is notable. Ethereum has recovered nearly 80% of its first-quarter losses. Bitcoin, while not yet at its all-time highs, is now trading within reach of that level. Historically, Q4 and Q1 have delivered stronger results for Bitcoin and Ethereum, often tied to end-of-year positioning and early-cycle optimism. Q2 tends to be more volatile, with outcomes often shaped by policy developments and regulatory activity. In 2022, Bitcoin posted a Q2 loss of 56.2%, while Ethereum dropped 67.34%. The following year saw modest Q2 gains of 7.19% and 6.29% for BTC and ETH respectively. Against that backdrop, the performance in Q2 2025 stands out not just for its scale, but for reversing a sharp downtrend from earlier in the year. Spot ETF volumes bounce back One of the defining features of Q2’s crypto recovery has been the steady rise in institutional participation, particularly through spot ETFs. Bitcoin ETFs, led by BlackRock’s IBIT, saw a notable resurgence in investor interest through June, effectively ending a brief period of declining activity. According to data, over 210 million IBIT shares were traded in the week ending Jun. 27, reflecting a 22.2% increase from the previous week and reversing a four-week downtrend in trading volume. That volume recovery has been accompanied by consistent capital inflows. BlackRock’s IBIT alone attracted $1.31 billion in net inflows last week, slightly ahead of the $1.23 billion it pulled in the week prior. Over the month of June, the fund has drawn in $3.74 billion, reflecting its dominant role in channeling large-scale investment into Bitcoin. Cumulatively, all 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs listed in the U.S. have attracted over $4 billion in net inflows this month, marking their third straight month of positive flows. Moreover, since Jun. 9, the segment has not recorded a single net outflow day, a sign that institutional demand is holding steady despite broader market uncertainties. As of this writing on Jun. 30, all the spot BTC ETFs have a combined assets under management exceeding $135 billion. Meanwhile, Ethereum ETFs have shown a similar course , albeit on a smaller base. Inflows into spot ETH ETFs climbed to $283 million last week, a sharp rise from the $40 million added the week before. That jump has helped June surpass May and April’s figures, with a total of $1.13 billion entering Ethereum ETFs this month. In comparison, May saw $564 million in inflows, and April had $66.2 million. Over the past seven weeks, ETH ETFs have now recorded uninterrupted weekly inflows, the longest streak since their inception. Total cumulative inflows into Ethereum ETFs have exceeded $4.1 billion since September, bringing total AUM to $9.88 billion. BlackRock’s ETHA fund currently holds the largest share, with $4.25 billion in assets. While this is still smaller than Bitcoin’s footprint in the ETF space, the pace of growth over the past two months indicates growing confidence in Ethereum’s investment thesis. Crypto’s institutional reframing Recent moves by institutional leaders and policymakers suggest a shift in how Bitcoin and Ethereum are perceived in modern portfolios. Ric Edelman, founder of the $300 billion advisory firm Edelman Financial Engines, has laid out a new investment framework that places crypto in every category of investor allocation. . @ricedelman , who founded $300bil investment advisory firm Edelman Financial Engines… Recommends *40%* crypto allocation for aggressive investors. 10% for conservative. Says owning crypto is no longer a speculative position; failing to do so is. Look at these takeaways. pic.twitter.com/OB5N5c6cAQ — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) June 30, 2025 Edelman’s recommendation proposes that even conservative investors allocate 10% to crypto, with moderate clients going up to 25% and aggressive ones as high as 40%. His outlook challenges the long-standing 60-40 stock-bond model and positions crypto not as a speculative add-on but as an essential component of diversified exposure. Edelman’s reasoning is rooted in historical data. Over the past 15 years, Bitcoin has outperformed all other asset classes. Portfolios that included Bitcoin have shown stronger returns and lower drawdowns, while also scoring higher on traditional portfolio metrics such as the Sharpe and Sortino ratios. The market appears to be following through on this logic. MicroStrategy, on Jun. 29, acquired another 4,980 BTC at an average price of $106,801 per coin, bringing its total holdings to 597,325 BTC, purchased at an average of just under $71,000. The firm’s Bitcoin yield year-to-date is nearly 20%. Strategy has acquired 4,980 BTC for ~$531.9 million at ~$106,801 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 19.7% YTD 2025. As of 6/29/2025, we hodl 597,325 $BTC acquired for ~$42.40 billion at ~$70,982 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRK $STRF $STRD https://t.co/xvWnSkfukS — Michael Saylor (@saylor) June 30, 2025 Wall Street strategist Tom Lee is also placing a bold bet on crypto.

Meanwhile, Kazakhstan’s central bank is studying the creation of a national crypto reserve. The proposal includes using assets sourced from government-run mining and confiscations, with the goal of placing them under regulated central control. Authorities have acknowledged the risks of volatility but argue that structured oversight can offer better integration into national financial frameworks. If implemented, Kazakhstan would be one of the earliest nations to formally hold crypto at the central bank level, following El Salvador and the U.S. Amid this, macroeconomic policy remains a wildcard. The Federal Reserve has kept interest rates steady at 4.25% to 4.50%, but Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari has reaffirmed expectations of two rate cuts before the end of the year. The first could come as early as September, depending on incoming inflation and employment data. President Trump has also renewed calls for a sharper cut, targeting a 1% policy rate in the upcoming July meeting. If the Federal Reserve proceeds with rate cuts while institutions continue to scale up exposure, capital could keep flowing into risk assets, especially crypto. Bitcoin may remain the primary beneficiary as a macro hedge, while Ethereum could gain from capital trickle-down effects. Macro will decide the next move Heading into Q3, all eyes will be on the Fed’s July meeting and its response to cooling inflation data. A confirmed rate cut could reinforce risk-on sentiment across markets, with crypto likely to benefit from renewed capital inflows. Traders will also be watching for updates on the U.S. crypto tax bill, enforcement actions, and spot ETF expansion, especially around Ethereum. If ETH ETFs continue attracting steady inflows, Ethereum may begin to close the gap with Bitcoin in institutional portfolios. In the background, macro events remain unpredictable. Any escalation in global trade tensions, especially involving China and the U.S., could revive volatility. Meanwhile, on-chain data suggests leverage in derivatives markets is climbing again, which could amplify both rallies and corrections in the weeks ahead. For now, the market is holding its Q2 gains, but sustained momentum will likely depend on a clear rate cut signal and continued institutional positioning. Without either, the rally could stall. But if both align, Q3 could extend the uptrend, with Ethereum potentially leading the next leg. However, nothing is ever guaranteed in the crypto world.

The latest records from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services show that Central Kentucky Radiology (CKR) suffered a hacking/IT incident affecting 166,953 Americans. In a notice , CKR says that an unknown attacker breached the firm’s systems, stealing patient data that may include names, Social Security numbers, addresses, dates of birth, dates of medical service and medical services charges. “On October 18, 2024, CKR became aware of a network disruption in its environment. CKR immediately took steps to secure our systems and launched an investigation into the nature and scope of the event. The investigation determined that from October 16 to October 18, 2024, an unauthorized actor accessed and copied files from certain systems in its environment. In response, CKR conducted a detailed review of the potentially impacted files to understand their content and to whom they relate. On May 7, 2025, CKR completed this review and determined that information related to you was contained in the potentially impacted files.” CKR is a doctor-led radiology medical group offering diagnostic and interventional imaging services to hospitals, outpatient centers and physician offices. In light of the event, CKR says it is reviewing its security policies and procedures as well as implementing additional measures to stifle further breaches. The firm is also offering complimentary credit monitoring services to individuals whose Social Security numbers or payment card details may have been compromised.

2025-06-30T16:53:47,"Sparkassen, the German bank that said ‘Nein’ to Bitcoin is now building a gateway","Three years after shutting down the idea, Germany’s largest banking group is making a U-turn. Sparkassen plans to let retail clients trade Bitcoin and other digital assets by 2026, signaling a seismic shift in traditional finance’s stance on crypto. On June 30, Bloomberg reported that Sparkassen, the German sprawling network of savings banks with roughly 50 million clients, will roll out cryptocurrency trading for retail customers by summer 2026, marking a stark reversal from its 2023 decision to block such services. The move, confirmed by the German Savings Banks and Giro Association, will allow customers to buy and sell digital assets like Bitcoin ( BTC ) through DekaBank, Sparkassen’s securities arm, via their existing banking apps. The pivot marks more than a product rollout. In a country where conservative banking has long defined consumer finance, Sparkassen’s move signals a broader institutional acceptance of digital assets as part of the future financial landscape. You might also like: SOL spot ETF with staking could go live this week, expert says From resistance to reluctant adoption: why Sparkassen flipped on crypto In 2023, Sparkassen’s internal committee dismissed crypto as too volatile, too risky, and too far outside traditional banking’s comfort zone. Today, that same institution is preparing to onboard millions of Germans into Bitcoin and other digital assets. What changed? A mix of regulatory clarity, competitive pressure, and undeniable client demand seem to have created forces too strong for even Europe’s most conservative banks to ignore. The timing closely tracks the turning point that came with the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation, which provided a long-awaited rulebook for banks entering the space. No longer forced to navigate a gray area, Sparkassen could finally build a compliant framework backed by DekaBank’s securities infrastructure. But regulation alone doesn’t explain the urgency. Matthias Dießl, chairman of the Bavarian Savings Banks Association, hinted at the real driver in an April interview with Bloomberg: “Our clients are asking for this.” With rival German cooperative banks like Volksbanken already racing toward crypto services, Sparkassen risked losing relevance if it stood still. Sparkassen isn’t acting in isolation. Beyond Germany, banks and traditional financial institutions across Europe are making calculated bets on digital assets, each with a slightly different approach. Standard Chartered, one of the world’s largest banks, secured a MiCA license in Luxembourg earlier this year, offering institutional-grade custody for Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH ). Notably, it stopped short of enabling trading, a contrast to Sparkassen’s retail-first plunge. BNP Paribas and Société Générale have also quietly expanded crypto custody and asset tokenization experiments, though neither has yet taken the full retail leap. Sparkassen’s reversal isn’t just a business decision; it’s a cultural shift. With MiCA in play, the EU is effectively forcing traditional finance to choose: adapt or cede ground to agile competitors.

2025-06-30T16:49:21,"XRP Price Prediction – RLUSD Becomes the Fastest-Growing Stablecoin: XRP to $10 Next?","The XRP price (XRP) has gone up by 9.1% in the past 7 days as cryptos continue recovering from last week’s sharp pullback triggered by rising Middle East tensions. Once again, the native asset of the Ripple network has returned to positive year-to-date gains, now up 4.8% since January. Ripple has also doubled down on ecosystem expansion, with new initiatives focused on accelerating adoption of its stablecoin, Ripple USD (RLUSD). As these efforts gain traction, the XRP price prediction has turned increasingly bullish — with some analysts eyeing a potential breakout in the coming weeks. Data from DeFi Llama indicates that this token’s market cap has been expanding rapidly this year from $58 million to $455 million at the time of writing, making it the fastest-growing stablecoin. @Ripple 's RLUSD stablecoin is growing on @ethereum , with supply up ~4x since January. pic.twitter.com/nQ88TYVtnc — Token Terminal (@tokenterminal) June 28, 2025 The majority of RLUSD’s circulating supply is currently on the Ethereum network. In the past month, the token’s market cap in this network has jumped by 61%. Since its launch, RLUSD has processed cumulative volumes of $10 billion since its launch as the token has been listed by multiple top exchanges like Kraken, Bitstamp, Bitget, and Gemini. Growing adoption of RLUSD across the globe and on-chain favors a bullish XRP price action , especially if transaction volumes start to increase within the Ripple network as a result of its rising popularity. XRP Price Prediction: XRP Could Retest the $2.33 Level as Cryptos Keep Recovering Looking at the 4-hour chart for XRP, the price has successfully bounced off the 2.07 support and has already moved near the $2.2 level. Geopolitical risks seem to have eased, or at least the market has embraced that perception, as Israel and Iran negotiated a cease-fire with the help of President Donald Trump. Meanwhile, the Chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, confirmed this week that the institution still plans to cut rates twice this year despite the uncertainty caused by the administration’s aggressive trade policies. This has improved XRP’s outlook in the near term and supports a push to its nearest resistance at 2.33. Momentum indicators are still in positive territory as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits above 50. Although XRP may not get to $10 in the next few days, an expanding RLUSD market cap means that it could get there in the months to come. The stablecoin’s success could skyrocket Ripple’s transaction volumes and create a new source of demand for the utility token. As crypto continues to recover, a new crypto presale called BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) will benefit from Bitcoin’s ongoing push to a new all-time high. BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) Introduces Reward System Tied to Bitcoin’s Price Milestones BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) gives investors the chance to earn passive income as Bitcoin continues to make higher highs. This meme coin’s reward system is tied to the performance of the top crypto and automatically distributes these prizes once a new price milestone is hit. Starting at a baseline price of $100,000, BTCBULL holders will receive a new reward for every $25,000 that BTC adds to its price. The first milestone in the roadmap is set at $125,000, at which point a portion of the token’s circulating supply will be burned. Next up, once Bitcoin hits $150K, BTCBULL investors will receive a direct airdrop of Bitcoin. To buy $BTCBULL and start earning passive income, head to the BTC Bull Token website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH or use a bank card to invest.

2025-06-30T16:33:36,"Pi Coin Price Prediction – Pi Network Quietly Just Got a Whole Lot More Powerful: Here’s Why It Matters","The Pi Coin price has dropped by 4% in the past 24 hours, with its fall to $0.5104 coming as the crypto market as a whole declines by 1.5% today. PI is now flat in the past week but down by 15% in a fortnight and by 17% in the last 30 days, with the altcoin also suffering an 83% decline since peaking at $2.99 on February 26. Despite these losses, Pi Network has been steadily upgrading and improving itself over the past few months, with Pi2Day (June 28) seeing the platform roll out two interesting applications. Combined with other recent updates, these enhance Pi Network’s usability and fundamentals, and point towards a healthy long-term Pi price prediction . Pi Coin Price Prediction – Pi Network Quietly Just Got a Whole Lot More Powerful: Here’s Why It Matters Marking Pi2Day on X, Pi Network’s team announced that it’s adding “two exciting features to the ecosystem,” while also delivering several minor tech and product updates. Happy Pi2Day 2025! Today, Pi has introduced two exciting features to the ecosystem and provided various tech and product updates. First, Pi App Studio is an AI-powered platform that enables anyone to create Pi apps without coding—created to solve problems the world faces as AI… pic.twitter.com/6ZiVefdYsZ — Pi Network (@PiCoreTeam) June 28, 2025 The first, and arguably the most exciting, is an AI-powered app development studio that, according to Pi Network, enables “anyone to create Pi apps without coding.” The second is Ecosystem Directory Staking, a feature that allows users and developers to boost a given app’s ranking in Pi’s Ecosystem Interface by staking PI. However, the wider crypto ecosystem doesn’t seem too fussed about these upgrades, with PI having a disappointing day so far. If we look at its chart, we see that it continues to show quite acute weakness, having occupied a steadily descending band since a peak in the middle of May. Its RSI (purple) has gone from 70 a week ago to just under 40 today, and it looks as though it may continue descending for a few days yet. Source: TradingView Something similar is happening with its moving average convergence divergence (orange, blue), which has also recently begun declining. The technicals therefore don’t look great for the Pi Coin price, which could slip below $0.50 in the next week or so, and maybe even reach $0.45 or $0.40 before bottoming out. However, the aforementioned upgrades highlight how Pi Network is taking steps to improve its utility and attract developers, apps and users to its network, something which does have positive medium- and long-term implications. It could therefore begin recovering more steadily in concert with the wider market, which continues to react badly to tension in the Middle East and ongoing tariff issues . But if such issues continue to ease, the Pi Coin price could reach $1 again within a few weeks and even higher by the end of the year. Best Wallet Raises $13.6 Million in Native Token Presale: The Strongest New Coin of 2025? On the other hand, there’s always a chance that, without major exchange listings, Pi Network will continue to decline. If so, traders may prefer to turn to alternatives already, and fortunately there is a wide variety of new interesting tokens on the market. Some of these are presale coins, which can raise large sums of money and then go on to rally strongly after listing for the first time. One coin with a good chance of doing this is Best Wallet Token (BEST), an ERC-20 coin that has now raised $13.6 million in its sale. Over $13M Raised and Counting! Best Wallet is becoming the go-to for traders who want speed, simplicity, and early access to what matters: Buy new tokens early, directly in-app Buy and bridge across chains in one place Full portfolio control, no clutter Download… pic.twitter.com/0SDNVPov6v — Best Wallet (@BestWalletHQ) June 4, 2025 Best Wallet Token is arguably the best presale coin to invest in right now, given that it’s the native token for the pre-established and popular Best Wallet app. Since launching in 2023, Best Wallet has become one of the most widely used software wallets in crypto, with the app currently serving 250,000 monthly users. This gives BEST a large pool of potential users, with the coin providing its holders with a number of perks when they use the Best Wallet app. This includes reduced transaction fees, higher staking payouts, governance rights, and early access to new projects and tokens.

The token has since retreated to $85.21, down 3.17% since the session’s peak and 1.5% in the last 24-hour period. That stumble erased the week’s slim gains and set a new line in the sand for bulls. The drop came at a time in which bitcoin (BTC) has been its dominance increase, while its volatility dropped below the 40 mark in a potential sign of incoming action. Technical Analysis Overview Litecoin’s price swung significantly in the last 24-hour period, covering a $3.05 range, or roughly 3.5%. The token encountered stiff resistance between $88.00 and $88.42, where sellers stepped in heavily, particularly during late evening trading hours, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model. After peaking, LTC reversed lower and found new support at $85.37. The steepest drop was accompanied by the session’s highest trading volume of over 180,000 tokens, signaling strong bearish sentiment. Short-term trading saw additional volatility. In the last few hours of trading, LTC spiked from $85.65 to $86.05, a 0.47% jump, on a burst of buying. But momentum quickly reversed, sending prices back down to $85.53 on another volume spike. This cemented resistance near $86.05 and reinforced the new support level at $85.37, leaving Litecoin at $85.42 as the session ended.
