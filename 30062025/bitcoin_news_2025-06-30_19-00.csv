The latest records from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services show that Central Kentucky Radiology (CKR) suffered a hacking/IT incident affecting 166,953 Americans. In a notice , CKR says that an unknown attacker breached the firm’s systems, stealing patient data that may include names, Social Security numbers, addresses, dates of birth, dates of medical service and medical services charges. “On October 18, 2024, CKR became aware of a network disruption in its environment. CKR immediately took steps to secure our systems and launched an investigation into the nature and scope of the event. The investigation determined that from October 16 to October 18, 2024, an unauthorized actor accessed and copied files from certain systems in its environment. In response, CKR conducted a detailed review of the potentially impacted files to understand their content and to whom they relate. On May 7, 2025, CKR completed this review and determined that information related to you was contained in the potentially impacted files.” CKR is a doctor-led radiology medical group offering diagnostic and interventional imaging services to hospitals, outpatient centers and physician offices. In light of the event, CKR says it is reviewing its security policies and procedures as well as implementing additional measures to stifle further breaches. The firm is also offering complimentary credit monitoring services to individuals whose Social Security numbers or payment card details may have been compromised.

2025-06-30T16:53:47,"Sparkassen, the German bank that said ‘Nein’ to Bitcoin is now building a gateway","Three years after shutting down the idea, Germany’s largest banking group is making a U-turn. Sparkassen plans to let retail clients trade Bitcoin and other digital assets by 2026, signaling a seismic shift in traditional finance’s stance on crypto. On June 30, Bloomberg reported that Sparkassen, the German sprawling network of savings banks with roughly 50 million clients, will roll out cryptocurrency trading for retail customers by summer 2026, marking a stark reversal from its 2023 decision to block such services. The move, confirmed by the German Savings Banks and Giro Association, will allow customers to buy and sell digital assets like Bitcoin ( BTC ) through DekaBank, Sparkassen’s securities arm, via their existing banking apps. The pivot marks more than a product rollout. In a country where conservative banking has long defined consumer finance, Sparkassen’s move signals a broader institutional acceptance of digital assets as part of the future financial landscape. You might also like: SOL spot ETF with staking could go live this week, expert says From resistance to reluctant adoption: why Sparkassen flipped on crypto In 2023, Sparkassen’s internal committee dismissed crypto as too volatile, too risky, and too far outside traditional banking’s comfort zone. Today, that same institution is preparing to onboard millions of Germans into Bitcoin and other digital assets. What changed? A mix of regulatory clarity, competitive pressure, and undeniable client demand seem to have created forces too strong for even Europe’s most conservative banks to ignore. The timing closely tracks the turning point that came with the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation, which provided a long-awaited rulebook for banks entering the space. No longer forced to navigate a gray area, Sparkassen could finally build a compliant framework backed by DekaBank’s securities infrastructure. But regulation alone doesn’t explain the urgency. Matthias Dießl, chairman of the Bavarian Savings Banks Association, hinted at the real driver in an April interview with Bloomberg: “Our clients are asking for this.” With rival German cooperative banks like Volksbanken already racing toward crypto services, Sparkassen risked losing relevance if it stood still. Sparkassen isn’t acting in isolation. Beyond Germany, banks and traditional financial institutions across Europe are making calculated bets on digital assets, each with a slightly different approach. Standard Chartered, one of the world’s largest banks, secured a MiCA license in Luxembourg earlier this year, offering institutional-grade custody for Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH ). Notably, it stopped short of enabling trading, a contrast to Sparkassen’s retail-first plunge. BNP Paribas and Société Générale have also quietly expanded crypto custody and asset tokenization experiments, though neither has yet taken the full retail leap. Sparkassen’s reversal isn’t just a business decision; it’s a cultural shift. With MiCA in play, the EU is effectively forcing traditional finance to choose: adapt or cede ground to agile competitors.

2025-06-30T16:49:21,"XRP Price Prediction – RLUSD Becomes the Fastest-Growing Stablecoin: XRP to $10 Next?","The XRP price (XRP) has gone up by 9.1% in the past 7 days as cryptos continue recovering from last week’s sharp pullback triggered by rising Middle East tensions. Once again, the native asset of the Ripple network has returned to positive year-to-date gains, now up 4.8% since January. Ripple has also doubled down on ecosystem expansion, with new initiatives focused on accelerating adoption of its stablecoin, Ripple USD (RLUSD). As these efforts gain traction, the XRP price prediction has turned increasingly bullish — with some analysts eyeing a potential breakout in the coming weeks. Data from DeFi Llama indicates that this token’s market cap has been expanding rapidly this year from $58 million to $455 million at the time of writing, making it the fastest-growing stablecoin. @Ripple 's RLUSD stablecoin is growing on @ethereum , with supply up ~4x since January. pic.twitter.com/nQ88TYVtnc — Token Terminal (@tokenterminal) June 28, 2025 The majority of RLUSD’s circulating supply is currently on the Ethereum network. In the past month, the token’s market cap in this network has jumped by 61%. Since its launch, RLUSD has processed cumulative volumes of $10 billion since its launch as the token has been listed by multiple top exchanges like Kraken, Bitstamp, Bitget, and Gemini. Growing adoption of RLUSD across the globe and on-chain favors a bullish XRP price action , especially if transaction volumes start to increase within the Ripple network as a result of its rising popularity. XRP Price Prediction: XRP Could Retest the $2.33 Level as Cryptos Keep Recovering Looking at the 4-hour chart for XRP, the price has successfully bounced off the 2.07 support and has already moved near the $2.2 level. Geopolitical risks seem to have eased, or at least the market has embraced that perception, as Israel and Iran negotiated a cease-fire with the help of President Donald Trump. Meanwhile, the Chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, confirmed this week that the institution still plans to cut rates twice this year despite the uncertainty caused by the administration’s aggressive trade policies. This has improved XRP’s outlook in the near term and supports a push to its nearest resistance at 2.33. Momentum indicators are still in positive territory as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits above 50. Although XRP may not get to $10 in the next few days, an expanding RLUSD market cap means that it could get there in the months to come. The stablecoin’s success could skyrocket Ripple’s transaction volumes and create a new source of demand for the utility token. As crypto continues to recover, a new crypto presale called BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) will benefit from Bitcoin’s ongoing push to a new all-time high. BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) Introduces Reward System Tied to Bitcoin’s Price Milestones BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) gives investors the chance to earn passive income as Bitcoin continues to make higher highs. This meme coin’s reward system is tied to the performance of the top crypto and automatically distributes these prizes once a new price milestone is hit. Starting at a baseline price of $100,000, BTCBULL holders will receive a new reward for every $25,000 that BTC adds to its price. The first milestone in the roadmap is set at $125,000, at which point a portion of the token’s circulating supply will be burned. Next up, once Bitcoin hits $150K, BTCBULL investors will receive a direct airdrop of Bitcoin. To buy $BTCBULL and start earning passive income, head to the BTC Bull Token website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH or use a bank card to invest.

2025-06-30T16:33:36,"Pi Coin Price Prediction – Pi Network Quietly Just Got a Whole Lot More Powerful: Here’s Why It Matters","The Pi Coin price has dropped by 4% in the past 24 hours, with its fall to $0.5104 coming as the crypto market as a whole declines by 1.5% today. PI is now flat in the past week but down by 15% in a fortnight and by 17% in the last 30 days, with the altcoin also suffering an 83% decline since peaking at $2.99 on February 26. Despite these losses, Pi Network has been steadily upgrading and improving itself over the past few months, with Pi2Day (June 28) seeing the platform roll out two interesting applications. Combined with other recent updates, these enhance Pi Network’s usability and fundamentals, and point towards a healthy long-term Pi price prediction . Pi Coin Price Prediction – Pi Network Quietly Just Got a Whole Lot More Powerful: Here’s Why It Matters Marking Pi2Day on X, Pi Network’s team announced that it’s adding “two exciting features to the ecosystem,” while also delivering several minor tech and product updates. Happy Pi2Day 2025! Today, Pi has introduced two exciting features to the ecosystem and provided various tech and product updates.

However, the wider crypto ecosystem doesn’t seem too fussed about these upgrades, with PI having a disappointing day so far. If we look at its chart, we see that it continues to show quite acute weakness, having occupied a steadily descending band since a peak in the middle of May. Its RSI (purple) has gone from 70 a week ago to just under 40 today, and it looks as though it may continue descending for a few days yet. Source: TradingView Something similar is happening with its moving average convergence divergence (orange, blue), which has also recently begun declining. The technicals therefore don’t look great for the Pi Coin price, which could slip below $0.50 in the next week or so, and maybe even reach $0.45 or $0.40 before bottoming out. However, the aforementioned upgrades highlight how Pi Network is taking steps to improve its utility and attract developers, apps and users to its network, something which does have positive medium- and long-term implications. It could therefore begin recovering more steadily in concert with the wider market, which continues to react badly to tension in the Middle East and ongoing tariff issues . But if such issues continue to ease, the Pi Coin price could reach $1 again within a few weeks and even higher by the end of the year. Best Wallet Raises $13.6 Million in Native Token Presale: The Strongest New Coin of 2025? On the other hand, there’s always a chance that, without major exchange listings, Pi Network will continue to decline. If so, traders may prefer to turn to alternatives already, and fortunately there is a wide variety of new interesting tokens on the market. Some of these are presale coins, which can raise large sums of money and then go on to rally strongly after listing for the first time. One coin with a good chance of doing this is Best Wallet Token (BEST), an ERC-20 coin that has now raised $13.6 million in its sale. Over $13M Raised and Counting! Best Wallet is becoming the go-to for traders who want speed, simplicity, and early access to what matters: Buy new tokens early, directly in-app Buy and bridge across chains in one place Full portfolio control, no clutter Download… pic.twitter.com/0SDNVPov6v — Best Wallet (@BestWalletHQ) June 4, 2025 Best Wallet Token is arguably the best presale coin to invest in right now, given that it’s the native token for the pre-established and popular Best Wallet app. Since launching in 2023, Best Wallet has become one of the most widely used software wallets in crypto, with the app currently serving 250,000 monthly users. This gives BEST a large pool of potential users, with the coin providing its holders with a number of perks when they use the Best Wallet app. This includes reduced transaction fees, higher staking payouts, governance rights, and early access to new projects and tokens. Holders will also be able to stake the token for a passive income, making it potentially one of the most profitable coins to hold this years. What is a multi-chain wallet?

2025-06-30T16:25:39,"GDLC Is A Sell Ahead Of Its Imminent, Likely Conversion To An ETF","Summary GDLC now trades at fair value after closing its NAV discount, removing the prior arbitrage opportunity that drove outperformance versus Bitcoin. With a 2.5% expense ratio, poor liquidity, and no clear portfolio role, I think GDLC is fundamentally unattractive compared to direct crypto or ETF exposure. If ETF conversion is approved, GDLC offers no upside (an ETF cannot trade at premium); if denied, it risks returning to a NAV discount, both scenarios unfavorable for new investors. Given these factors, I recommend a SELL on GDLC at current prices, as there is effectively no upside in any likely scenario. I think investors who already have GDLC are better off converting their position (trading at fair value) into more efficient, more liquid products. In the world of cryptocurrencies, there are several proxies and exotic products that investors can utilize to gain exposure to this asset class. Some of these may resemble a black box, commanding a NAV premium (or discount) against their mere holdings for reasons that are unclear and debatable. Today, I discuss again one of these tools: the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund ETF ( OTCQX:GDLC ), which contains a set of cryptocurrencies (mostly Bitcoin) and currently trades roughly in line with its NAV. GLDC outperformed Bitcoin despite never converting into an ETF I covered the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund ETF ( OTCQX:GDLC ) roughly one year ago , at the time refraining from a “BUY” because I did not see a conversion to an ETF as likely. Yet, I did see a decent risk / reward for anyone already having the fund in their portfolio (given it traded at a NAV discount at that time) and ended up recommending a “HOLD”. As I suspected back then, GDLC never converted into an ETF. Despite SeekingAlpha calling it an “ETF”, the issuer clearly states this is not an ETF in the dedicated GLDC page . Grayscale defines GDLC as a publicly traded fund quoted on the OTC Markets Group under the Alternative Reporting Standards, where investors can buy and sell shares through traditional brokerage accounts at market-dictated prices. To be clear though, Grayscale has filed a request to the SEC to convert GDLC into an ETF in September 2024. While the SEC has not yet ruled on this request, it is supposed to do so by July 2nd - in a few days from when this article was written. This reason is also why I am recommending a SELL today, as I will outline later in the article. Despite being right about GDLC not becoming an ETF, I recognize I was too cautious with my HOLD recommendation. As the chart below shows, in the last year GDLC outperformed Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). When it comes to Bitcoin proxies, it was only beaten by MicroStrategy Incorporated ( MSTR ) during that time frame. Bitcoin miners lagged behind both BTC and GDLC. GDLC vs. BTC and proxies, 1 year (Seeking Alpha) This overperformance, in my view, is derived from GDLC closing its NAV discount and even briefly trading at a NAV premium a few months ago . Most of GDLC's performance happened in late 2024 - something unsurprising given that's exactly when Grayscale filed for the conversion of this fund into an ETF. GDLC traded at roughly a ~30% NAV discount one year ago, at the time of my first coverage. The gap closed and it even became a NAV premium of roughly 10% in April. Today, GDLC trades roughly in line with the value of its holdings as per my calculations below: BTC per share: 0.00036294 × $ 107,500 = $ 39.01 ETH-USD per share: 0.00220672 × $2,450 = $5.40 XRP-USD per share: 1.06345318 × $2.18 = $2.31 SOL-USD per share: 0.00935443 × $150 = $1.40 ADA-USD per share: 0.65811335 × $0.57 = $0.37 For a total of $ 48.51 worth of cryptocurrencies per share, against a share price of $ 47.40 at the time of writing, the fund trades roughly at the value of its NAV. This marginal discount of less than 2% is in my opinion negligible , especially considering the fund charges a hefty 2.50% yearly expense ratio to investors (more on these later). To note, if Grayscale succeeds into making GDLC into an ETF, this gap will close completely and permanently - as ETFs do not trade at a significant premium or discount against their holdings (net of fees and liquidity). My fundamental issue with GDLC as an investment: its objectives When I evaluate any fund or an ETF, I always start by asking myself what is the objective of such a fund and what role it may play in an investor’s portfolio. The main issue I have with GDLC is that I struggle to see any use case for investors. This fund is effectively a sort of relic of the past - it was launched in 2018, back when the regulatory framework for cryptocurrency was still fairly hostile and investors had difficulty gaining exposure to this asset class. In that context, paying a 2.50% fee for a somewhat illiquid product with questionable allocation to cryptocurrencies may have made sense to gain exposure to a nascent asset class. A plus back then was that GDLC represented one of the few SEC-registered crypto products. Today, crypto ETFs are available via normal brokerages and investors can also access crypto via increasingly regulated and safer centralized exchanges such as Coinbase Global, Inc ( COIN ). What’s more, is that the crypto space has matured since 2018 and, in my view, Bitcoin emerged as a clear winner of the space so far. Bitcoin’s dominance (Bitcoin’s market cap relative to the whole crypto space) is close to all time highs at ~65% , while it was in the low 40s when the fund launched. Many cryptocurrencies also became irrelevant in that time frame. GDLC’s holdings (reflecting the first five cryptocurrencies by market capitalization) show this, since the fund today features more than 80% of its holdings in Bitcoin itself. Even just one year ago, at the time of my first coverage, GDLC held Avalanche ( AVAX-USD ), a cryptocurrency that today it does not feature anymore, having been replaced by Cardano. I see such dynamics as reflecting a rapidly changing cryptocurrency landscape which makes GDLC fundamentally unattractive by design as a long term vehicle for crypto exposure. In simple words, I believe that investors wanting to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies would be better off simply buying them separately either as ETFs or via regulated crypto exchanges. That would also allow them to fine tune their exposure to the projects (and the weights) they deem best for their portfolios. Given an unclear use case of GDLC and the fact the fund trades already at a fair NAV valuation (which is set to remain as such in case of a successful ETF conversion), I do not see any other reason why it should keep overperforming in the future. GDLC vs. BTC and proxies, 3 months (Seeking Alpha) This is already observable in the last 3 months, when GDLC started to show a relative underperformance, returning just about the same as Bitcoin. I expect this trend to continue, and GDLC to keep performing in line with its underlying assets, net of its expenses. Why I recommend a SELL for GDLC ahead of its (likely?) ETF conversion The issues I described in the previous section are only compounded by the fund’s hefty yearly expense ratio, at 2.50%, as well as by its relative illiquidity. GDLC has a bid/ask spread of roughly 0.15%, and a risk grade, including tracking errors, that Seeking Alpha rates with a Failing grade (see picture below). GDLC Risk Grade (Seeking Alpha) In short, this is not a very efficient fund. A broad and passive exposure to cryptocurrency is also not achieved either by GDLC, given the fund’s exposure is mostly towards Bitcoin and Ethereum, which together make 91% of GDLC’s holdings. Which brings me back to my original issue with GDLC: its lack of a clear objective and role in one’s portfolio. Going forward, I see only two scenarios for GDLC: If the SEC approves its ETF conversion, the fund is already fairly priced and due to its hefty expense ratio and sub-par liquidity is set to slightly underperform its underlying assets. This scenario represents no upside for investors today. If the SEC does not approve its ETF conversion, I believe it reasonable the fund will start trading once again at a NAV discount , until there is a reason to believe a conversion will be likely again. This scenario represents a downside for investors today. Because of the above logic, I find myself having to recommend a SELL at current prices. The only scenario where I see GDLC performing is one where the ETF conversion does not get approved in July, but it gets approved in a few months - providing an arbitrage opportunity. I will cover this next in my risk section. Risks to my thesis The main risk to my thesis is that GDLC could keep outperforming Bitcoin. This happened already in the past year and might repeat in the near future, even if today GDLC trades already at a fair valuation and I do not see any reason the market would put a premium on its holdings. To be clear, I would only deem this scenario likely if the current ETF conversion does not get approved (if it does, there cannot be any NAV premium!). GDLC could then start trading again at a NAV premium, but only if there was some news emerging about investors' ability to cash out their holdings. For example, a new potential ETF conversion (i.e. the SEC changing their mind shortly after refusing the conversion). Admittedly, this is a far fetched scenario - but one that I need to outline for readers as a risk. Conclusion: I see no upside in GDLC against BTC (or its underlying assets) I was too cautious in rating GDLC a “HOLD” one year ago, when I covered it for the first time. While I was technically correct in assuming the fund would not be transformed into an ETF (it hasn’t yet), this was no obstacle to GDLC’s closing its NAV premium, rallying on the news Grayscale filed for an ETF conversion in September last year. Today, ahead of its possible ETF conversion, GDLC trades at a fair value, from a 30% NAV discount one year ago. As a result, GDLC outperformed Bitcoin by more than 20% in that time frame. The issue with entering a position in GDLC today, however, is that there is effectively no upside in any scenario. If an ETF does get approved, the fund is fairly priced already, with a minimal 2% NAV discount. If an ETF does not get approved, the fund may again trade at a more significant NAV discount. The only scenario where GDLC could provide upside for investors is one where the ETF conversion does not happen and somehow the market starts assigning a NAV premium to GDLC. Highly unlikely, in my view, and the reason why I recommend a SELL at current levels. Note that my SELL rating is in no way associated to my views about BTC or the crypto space , but merely reflects the fact I think GDLC will underperform its underlying crypto assets in virtue of its hefty fees and illiquidity. In other terms, I believe investors who have GDLC would be better off converting their positions into more efficient funds, such as crypto ETFs or buying cryptocurrency directly via a centralized exchange.

Saylor commented that Metaplanet should keep rising until the second place, and then they’ll fight for the first place. This is alluding to the fact that Strategy is by far the leading company on that list, holding approximately 592,345 Bitcoin. In fact, it was reported that between June 23 and June 29, the company bought another 4,980 Bitcoin for approximately $531.9 million at an average price of $106,801 per Bitcoin. This just cements its lead as it’s now believed that MicroStrategy owns 597,325 Bitcoin.

James Seyffart posted on X on June 30 that the first Solana ( SOL ) spot ETF with staking is likely to launch for trading as early as this week. The Bloomberg analyst’s comment comes just days after REX Shares announced that its REX-Osprey SOL + Staking ETF is “coming soon.” The firm shared the announcement on June 28, 2025. Seems like this Solana Staking ETF could be going live this week. https://t.co/9eXFPnKqrV — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) June 30, 2025 You might also like: Bitcoin ETFs mark third week of consecutive inflows as BTC holds steady First SOL ETF with staking REX Shares submitted its ETF application via the C corporation, or ‘40 Act’ structure. Unlike the commonly used 19b-4 registration model adopted by many issuers, REX opted for a strategy that leverages a regulatory workaround. Analysts say this approach positioned the REX-Osprey ETF for first approval, as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission appears to have moved to greenlight it following initial reservations . ETF Store president Nate Geraci commented that the regulator looks to be comfortable with the SOL + Staking ETF’s launch. Other experts also offered similar comments. “Rex just filed letter to SEC asking if comments have been resolved for their ‘40 Act Solana Staking ETF. They’re no doubt trying to get it to mkt ahead of the spot ones,” Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas wrote after REX’s post. According to REX Shares, the Solana ETF set to launch will be the first staking-enabled cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund in the United States. The ETF will track Solana’s price performance while allowing investors to generate yield through on-chain staking. In addition to SOL exposure, the product offers access to staking rewards. Solana price has increased 2% in the past 24 hours to break above $155, with daily volume up 45% to $3.66 billion.

2025-06-30T16:11:13,"Crypto Investment Products Sees $2.7B in Weekly Inflows","The crypto investments continues to show strong momentum, with digital asset funds experiencing another week of gains. In CoinShares’ latest report, it was revealed that digital fund investment attracted $2.7 billion into the market last week, pushing the total for the year to $17.8 billion. This marks the 11th consecutive week of inflows, showing steady interest and rising confidence in the crypto space. Crypto Confidence Grows as Investments Top $184 Billion The recent surge in cryptocurrency investments has increased the total value of digital asset funds to over $184 billion. This indicates steady market growth, as more people recognize the long-term value of digital assets. Experts attribute this growing interest partly to global political changes and uncertain financial policies. These factors are leading more investors to turn to crypto, especially Bitcoin, as a safer investment option. Bitcoin Takes the Lead in Growing Crypto Market Bitcoin remained the top choice for investors last week. Products linked to the world’s largest cryptocurrency drew $2.2 billion in inflows, representing 83% of the total inflow. This brings Bitcoin’s total inflows for the year to $14.9 billion. At the same time, products that bet against the digital coin experienced small outflows. These short-Bitcoin funds saw $2.9 million leave last week and have lost a total of $12 million this year. This trend suggests that market sentiment toward Bitcoin has turned more positive in 2025. Bitcoin has performed well this year, mainly due to increased crypto investment in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), particularly in the United States. BlackRock’s Bitcoin fund IBIT is one of the most popular. According to CoinShares’ report, BlackRock’s IBIT raised over $1.5 billion last week and more than $17 billion since its launch in January 2024. These successful ETFs have made the U.S. the leading destination for crypto investments. In 2025 alone, over $16.8 billion has flowed into the U.S.-based crypto products. Ethereum and Other Coins Keep Growing Ethereum investment products also did well last week, attracting $429 million. This brings the total amount invested in ETH this year to $2.9 billion. Analysts say Ethereum’s recent Pectra upgrade and growing interest from major investors have helped sustain its momentum. Other digital assets are also attracting attention. Solana (SOL) saw $5.3 million in new investments last week, bringing its yearly total to $91 million. However, XRP outpaced Solana, raking in $219 million this year, while Sui brought in $104 million. While the U.S. remains the leader in crypto investments, other countries are also making strong contributions. Germany saw $939 million in inflows this year, followed by Canada with $164 million and Australia with $148 million. This shows that crypto interest is spreading globally, not just in the U.S. The post Crypto Investment Products Sees $2.7B in Weekly Inflows appeared first on TheCoinrise.com .",thecoinrise,https://thecoinrise.com/crypto-investment-products-sees-2-7b-in-weekly-inflows/,"BTC|ETH|MARKET|BUSINESS|SOL","Bitcoin News|Bitcoin|Crypto Investments|ethereum",cryptocompare

At the same time, Solana (SOL) is attempting to break out of a descending channel. Is $SOL about to take over the reigns from $ETH? $ETH strong rejection from $2,500 horizontal resistance Source: TradingView The short-term chart for $ETH shows a rejection from the very important $2,500 horizontal resistance level. This follows another rejection a few days ago. It may be that $ETH will continue to tap on the glass until it breaks, but for the time being at least the price has come back to rest on the $2,450 support, with the possibility that it may come back down to $2,400. $ETH still in consolidation mode Source: TradingView As can be seen from the daily chart, the current price action is following on from a break of a long-time descending trendline. Therefore, the sideways price movement is probably just a period of consolidation before the next leg higher. $SOL breakout attempt Source: TradingView Meanwhile, $SOL bulls are attempting a difficult breakout right now. It’s difficult because not only do the bulls need to push the price beyond the long-time descending trendline, but also they need to force the price through the strong resistance band from $150 to $152. If the bulls are successful, this would be an extremely bullish breakout for $SOL. That said, with a lot of the short-term Stochastic RSI indicators just rolling over from the top, upside price momentum is not on the side of the bulls. If the price does reject from here, support levels can be found at $148, $144, and $142. NOTE: At time of going to press, the $SOL price has just surged up as high as $157. It will remain to be seen if this breakout can be maintained. $SOL bullish break targets $158 resistance level Source: TradingView The weekly time frame for $SOL shows the current breakout beyond the upper trendline of the descending channel. The next resistance is just above at $158. If the bulls can continue this push and thrust the price though this resistance, $180 is the next target. Even more bullish is the Stochastic RSI on the weekly time frame. This is currently signalling a crossover of the indicator lines, which if confirmed at the end of this week, could signal a bounce from the 50.00 level and a return to strong upward price momentum for $SOL going forward.

In 2027, it will range between $59.93 and $71.39, with an average price of $61.59. In 2031, it will range between $267.69 and $326.17, with an average price of $277.23. AVAX exhibited wild price swings in 2024. This record came as the crypto market valuation peaked. It later reversed, shedding some of the profits in 2025. While the Avalanche ecosystem has been making strides, the AVAX price has left investors particularly questioning its trajectory. Will AVAX go up? Is AVAX a good investment? Let’s explore these and more in our Cryptopolitan price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Avalanche Symbol AVAX Current price $17.99 Market cap $7.59B Trading volume $262.03M Circulating supply 422.09M All-time high $146.22 on Nov 21, 2021 All-time low $2.79 on Dec 31, 2020 24-hour high $18.86 24-hour low $17.84 Avalanche price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day variation) 8.10% 50-day SMA $21.09 200-day SMA $22.92 Sentiment Bearish Green days 15/30 (50%) Avalanche price analysis As of June 30, AVAX’s price rose by 0.03% in 24 hours and dropped by 12.15% in the last 30 days. Its trading volume rose by 68.42% in 24 hours. AVAX/USD 1-day chart analysis AVAX/USD 1-day chart AVAX was in an ascending channel in the last quarter of 2024. The trend reversed in December, after reaching a high of $55.41 on Christmas Eve. The drop continued into 2025 and is yet to reverse. Last month, the coin attempted a recovery which saw it rise from a low of $19.09 to as high as $26.84. This month, it fell back below $19.00. The William Alligator trendlines now show that its volatility is dropping. The relative strength index is at 43.94 in neutral territory, with the MACD histogram showing positive market momentum. AVAX/USD 4-hour chart analysis AVAX/USD 4-hour chart The 4-hour chart highlights AVAX’s current run, which is consolidating. Like the daily chart, its RSI is in neutral territory at 52.09; the William Alligator trendlines show falling price volatility. Avalanche technical analysis: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 17.29 BUY SMA 5 17.98 BUY SMA 10 17.87 BUY SMA 21 18.77 SELL SMA 50 21.09 SELL SMA 100 20.92 SELL SMA 200 22.92 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 19.12 SELL EMA 5 19.74 SELL EMA 10 19.94 SELL EMA 21 19.86 SELL EMA 50 21.14 SELL EMA 100 24.45 SELL EMA 200 27.63 SELL What to expect from AVAX price analysis next? The combination of technical indicators and chart analysis suggests that Avalanche is bearish with dropping volatility. Chart analysis shows it will trade sideways over the short term. Recent news Filecoin Foundation and Avalanche have partnered to launch a new cross-chain data bridge. The bridge will allow developers to build on Avalanche’s C-Chain to store data on Filecoin’s decentralized network. Why is AVAX down? AVAX is correcting from its highest last year; the crypto market capitalization is also bearish. The drop in AVAX value could be attributed to the general market sentiment. Will AVAX reach $50? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, AVAX crossed the $50 mark in 2027. Will AVAX reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, AVAX will reach $100 in 2028, with a maximum price of $106.00 for the year. Can Avalanche reach $1,000? It remains highly unlikely that AVAX will cross the $1,000 mark before 2031. At that market capitalization, it could be more valuable than Ethereum. Can Avalanche reach $10,000? It remains highly unlikely that AVAX will cross the $10,000 mark before 2031. How much will Avalanche be worth in 2025? As the second half of 2025 unfolds, we anticipate it will trade between $19.06 and $33.36, with an average price of $29.46. Does Avalanche have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, AVAX will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or negative regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is Avalanche a good crypto to buy? Chart analysis suggests that Avalanche is recovering and currently gearing up for a closer move to $27 despite the overall bearish momentum.

Image source: CoinStats In July 2020, Avalanche completed its public sale, raising $42 million in less than $4.5 hours. The tokens were distributed after the mainnet launch in September. On Dec 31, 2020, it fell to an all-time low of $2.788. In September 2021, the Ava Labs Foundation received a $230 million investment from Polychain and Three Arrows Capital Group by purchasing the AVAX cryptocurrency. In November 2021, following an agreement with Deloitte to improve US disaster relief funding, AVAX moved to the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. At that time, AVAX moved to its all-time high at $146.22. In Aug 2022, a whistleblower, ‘crypto leaks’, published a report accusing Ava Labs of secret deals with a law firm to destabilize its competitors. Ava Labs CEO Emin Gün Sirer denied any dirty deal with Roche Freedmen law firm. In 2023, AVAX maintained a bullish trend between January and May, after which bears overwhelmed the market. It resumed the positive momentum in October, rising to $49.96 In 2024, it crossed the $60 mark in March. The rise coincided with a record high in AVAX inscriptions, with over 100 million ASC-20 minted since their introduction in June 2023. The uptrend reversed in April 2024; by July, it had fallen to $24.40. In August, it was at $21, and in September and October, it was at $27. It turned bullish in November 2024, rising from as low as $23 to as high as $55 in December. It later corrected and traded at $42 into 2025.

2025-06-30T15:27:46,"Areta: Crypto M&A tops $40b in 2025 as buyers seek scale and speed","With over 40 billion-dollar deals closed this year, crypto mergers have surged past anything the market has seen before. Areta co-founders trace the forces pushing institutional buyers to pick “buy” over “build” at a record pace. At a June 30 conference session during ETHCC 8, Areta co-founders Karl-Martin Ahrend and Jan-Philip Grabs walked attendees through what they described as the most active year in crypto M&A history. Drawing from their advisory work with major players including Robinhood, Swift, and MoonPay, the duo outlined the seismic shift driving 2025’s unprecedented M&A boom, revealing how regulatory clarity and institutional FOMO have turned acquisitions into crypto’s dominant growth strategy. The numbers speak for themselves: this year’s deal volume has already eclipsed all previous years combined, with trading infrastructure, staking, payments, and on-chain deals leading the charge. You might also like: Strategy joins Russell Top 200 Value Index with $64b BTC on the books The four fronts driving crypto’s acquisition frenzy The breakneck pace of crypto M&A isn’t accidental. Behind the 40+ billion-dollar deals of 2025 lie four strategic battlegrounds where acquirers are fighting for dominance: Trading platforms have become prime targets, not for retail user bases, but for regulatory licenses and institutional infrastructure. When Robinhood acquired Bitstamp earlier this year, insiders saw it as a regulatory power play. The acquisition gave Robinhood instant access to dozens of jurisdictions and a turnkey institutional trading desk. Similar moves by Coinbase and Swift reflect a new reality: compliance capabilities are now the competitive moat in crypto’s regulated future. “You’ve seen Robinhood acquiring Bitstamp to increase their licensing footprint around the globe and also add institutional trading capabilities.” Karl-Martin Ahrend noted. Swift has acquired AZ crypto… to obviously consolidate user numbers and create significant synergies between the two businesses.” The quiet consolidation in staking services tells another part of the story. As proof-of-stake networks now secure the majority of crypto’s value, control over validation operations has emerged as a strategic imperative. Firms like Source Strategies are absorbing smaller validators, such as Solana-native players, to bring key operations in-house. The goal across the board is vertical control, faster deployment, and future-proofing in an increasingly competitive arena. At the same time, payment processors are racing to own the entire stablecoin value chain, from issuance to settlement. Stripe’s acquisition of Preview and MoonPay’s European shopping spree reveal a clear pattern: companies are internalizing every step of crypto payments to capture this booming market. With nearly 80% of crypto businesses now using stablecoins for B2B transactions, these moves represent bets on crypto’s future as a mainstream payment rail rather than just a speculative asset. Perhaps the most radical development is unfolding transparently on blockchain ledgers themselves. The rise of token-based acquisitions, like Enzyme’s all-token purchase of Microfinance, shows how decentralized organizations are rewriting the M&A playbook. But as Areta’s Jan-Philip Grabs noted during the presentation, “Unlike in more traditional M&A deals… you’re really lacking the clear framework and processes.” These on-chain mergers face unique challenges, from community governance hurdles to untested legal ground, yet they point toward a future where blockchain-native dealmaking becomes commonplace.

Experienced Analyst Peter Brandt Reveals the Best BTC Strategy!","Experienced analyst Peter Brandt, who is followed by investors with his analyses of Bitcoin (BTC) and the cryptocurrency market, made a new post. Peter Brandt, who explains to investors how the ideal portfolio allocation should be with his 50 years of experience, argued that trading is the wrong path and choice for 95% of people. Brandt, who notes that some people need to focus on real-world skills rather than trading on screen or making quick profits, recommends monthly investment. Stating that people should focus on their daily lives at this point, the master analyst recommends investing 80% in S&P 500 and 20% in Bitcoin. Peter Brandt’s portfolio allocation is not a sign of an anti-Bitcoin stance. It is actually a clear sign that Brandt still sees BTC as an important part of his long-term portfolio strategy and values Bitcoin. Peter Brandt’s message here seems to be one of balance. While the analyst thinks Bitcoin is an ideal asset for making money in the long term, he argues that BTC should not be at the center of investments.

Brandt reminded that there is a potential for the formation of the double top pattern that Bitcoin followed in 2022 and resulted in a major 75% drop, and a 75% correction. According to the pattern, a double top at $ 110,000 was formed, and a low level of $ 75,000 was taken as the basis before the second peak was formed. In this context, according to the analyst, if BTC breaks below $ 75,000, this means that a double top pattern has formed and could lead to a 75% drop from the peak.

2025-06-30T15:19:43,"John Deaton Says Wall Street Greed Could Push XRP, ETH & SOL Into Treasuries","The post John Deaton Says Wall Street Greed Could Push XRP, ETH & SOL Into Treasuries appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Years ago, when John E Deaton, a well-known crypto advocate and legal voice in the XRP community, predicted that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and corporate crypto treasuries would expand beyond Bitcoin, many laughed! But today, those predictions are becoming reality—and fast. Now, again, Deaton says that Wall Street’s greed could make XRP, ETH, and SOL the next big treasury assets. Deaton’s “Greed Theory” Playing Out Deaton had one simple theory : Wall Street is too greedy to sit back and let only a few players profit from crypto. Earlier, Deaton said Wall Street would never let Michael Saylor be the only one using Bitcoin as a treasury strategy. According to Deaton, there are now between 60 and 100 companies that have implemented a Bitcoin treasury strategy. He believed the same would happen with other tokens too, once Bitcoin’s treasury strategy worked, others wanted in — and not just with Bitcoin. Meanwhile, companies are now adding ETH, XRP, and SOL to their corporate balance sheets to gain an edge. Who’s Holding XRP as a Treasury Asset? Deaton points out that at least five companies have already been betting on XRP’s treasury strategy : VivoPower International has raised $121 million for a $100 million XRP treasury plan, with strong backing from Saudi investors and advice from a former SBI Ripple Asia executive. Worksport Ltd., an American car parts company, set aside $5 million — or 10% of its spare cash — for XRP and Bitcoin. Hyperscale Data Inc. plans to launch an XRP lending platform by late 2025, listing XRP directly on its accounts. Webus International Limited , a Chinese company, partnered with Samara Alpha Management to manage a $300 million XRP treasury for cross-border payments. Wellgistics Health, Inc. uses XRP in its treasury to speed up payments in healthcare and avoid banking delays. It’s Not Just XRP — ETH and SOL Too Deaton pointed out that at least two companies now hold ETH as a treasury strategy, including Fundstrat and SharpLink Gaming, which has a $425 million ETH position supported by Consensys, Ethereum’s co-founder, Joseph Lubin’s company. For Solana, the list is growing too: Upexi raised $100 million for a Solana treasury. DeFi Development Corp saw its shares surge 3,000% after announcing SOL purchases. Sol Strategies has launched as a Solana treasury company, getting support from major firms like Cantor Fitzgerald. An unnamed EdTech company also plans to raise $500 million to hold SOL. Wall Street’s Hunger For Profit Meanwhile, Deaton said that this wasn’t just about XRP, Ethereum, or Solana—it was about understanding human behavior, the hunger for returns, and the inevitability of crypto adoption in corporate finance. As Deaton puts it, his predictions weren’t about specific cryptocurrencies, but about how people—and especially Wall Street—respond when they smell opportunity.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/john-deaton-says-wall-street-greed-could-push-xrp-eth-sol-into-treasuries/,"XRP|REGULATION|SOL|ETH|BTC","News",cryptocompare

2025-06-30T15:05:38,"Robinhood Launches Stock Tokens and L2 Blockchain To Expand Crypto Offerings in EU and US","Brokerage fintech firm Robinhood has unveiled a new suite of products and services, marking a major milestone for the cryptocurrency sector. Vlad Tenev, CEO and chairman of Robinhood, announced today at Robinhood Presents: To Catch a Token event in Cannes, France, that the firm is launching US stock and exchange-traded fund (ETF) tokens . “Our latest offerings lay the groundwork for crypto to become the backbone of the global financial system,” Tenev stated. Tomorrow. 5PM CEST. https://t.co/17NfkTzssx — Vlad Tenev (@vladtenev) June 29, 2025 EU Customers Gain Exposure to Tokenized US Stocks Tenev elaborated that Robinhood will provide eligible customers in the European Union (EU) with exposure to US equities through “Robinhood Stock Tokens.” He explained that the tokens will feature zero commissions or additional spreads from Robinhood (although other fees may apply), while providing full support and 24-hour access. “With tokenized stocks, our European app transitions from being a crypto-only app to an all-in-one investment app powered by crypto,” Tenev said. Robinhood will provide European customers with access to over 200 US stock and ETF tokens. Stock token holders will also be able to receive dividend payments directly in the Robinhood app. Source: Robinhood Robinhood’s Layer-2 Remains in Development Tenev further added that stock tokens will initially be issued on the Ethereum layer-2 (L2) platform, Arbitrum. Moving forward, he noted that the tokenized stocks will be facilitated by Robinhood’s own L2 blockchain, based on Arbitrum . Robinhood’s blockchain will be optimized for tokenized real-world assets and built to support 24/7 trading, seamless bridging, and self-custody. According to a Bloomberg report published on May 7, Robinhood has been planning to launch its blockchain-based platform to allow users in Europe to trade US securities. Robinhood Rolls Out Perpetual Futures Additionally, Robinhood has introduced crypto perpetual futures in the EU. According to Tenev, the platform will offer eligible customers access to a new class of derivatives, with continuous exposure and up to 3x leverage. He shared that perpetuals will be fully rolled out to eligible customers by the end of summer 2025. “Designed to help reduce the complexity typically associated with trading perpetuals, we built our interface with intuitive controls for setting position size and managing margin,” he said. Orders will be routed through Bitstamp’s perpetual futures exchange. Earlier in June, Robinhood announced it had completed a $200 million acquisition of crypto exchange Bitstamp . This allowed the fintech to secure more than 50 licenses and registrations worldwide. Although Robinhood announced its entry into crypto futures last July, the company said the rollout would initially be limited to Bitcoin ( BTC) and Ether ( ETH ). Crypto Staking Launches in the US Robinhood is also launching crypto staking for eligible US customers. The platform will begin with staking on Ethereum and Solana (SOL). Crypto staking was made available to all Robinhood customers in the EU and EEA last year. Elaborating on Robinhood’s new products, Tenev stated that for a limited time, both US and EU investors can transfer crypto into the Robinhood app to earn a 1% deposit boost. Investors will also have the chance to double their boost to 2% if the total deposits reach a goal of $500 million. Source: Robinhood Other new Robinhood products include Cortex, an AI-powered investing assistant that will be available later this year. A handful of Robinhood members will be able to use it to see curated insights, trends, and event-driven market analysis. “This is designed to help customers quickly understand price movement and market shifts in real time,” Tenev stated. Making Crypto Accessible to Everyone Robinhood’s expansion into cryptocurrency trading began in 2018. Since then, the firm’s footprint in the sector has greatly expanded . On June 27, Robinhood launched micro futures contracts for BTC, SOL, and XRP, giving crypto traders the ability to trade derivatives with much lower capital requirements. Robinhood has also strengthened its crypto offerings through strategic acquisitions of major players in the space. In addition to acquiring Bitstamp, the firm acquired WonderFi —a Canadian company that operates regulated crypto trading platforms—for $179 million. “Crypto was built by engineers for engineers, and has not been accessible to most people,” Johann Kerbrat, general manager and SVP of Robinhood Crypto, said. “We’re onboarding the world to crypto by making it as easy to use as possible—with the goal of bringing powerful tools into one intuitive platform.” The post Robinhood Launches Stock Tokens and L2 Blockchain To Expand Crypto Offerings in EU and US appeared first on Cryptonews .",cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/robinhood-stock-tokens-l2-blockchain-eu-us/,"BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|BTC|ETH","Blockchain News|News|Robinhood|Staking|Tokenization",cryptocompare

2025-06-30T14:58:56,"Tom Lee picks Ether over Bitcoin as primary treasury reserve asset: find out more","Fundstrat’s head of research, Tom Lee, wants to transform an under-the-radar crypto miner, BitMine Immersion Technologies, into the biggest publicly traded holder of Ethereum. On Monday, the BTC miner named Lee as its chairman of the board and announced plans to raise $250 million via a private placement as well. In its press release , the company confirmed that it will use proceeds from this private placement to buy Ether, adding that the crypto will begin serving as its primary treasury reserve asset over time. Note that the Ethereum price is currently up 70% versus its year-to-date low in early April. Why is Tom Lee onboard with BitMine’s ETH strategy? Lee is joining BitMine as its chairman at a time when the Senate’s approval of the “ GENIUS Act ” is driving unprecedented demand for stablecoins. He’s onboard with the company’s Ethereum strategy as the blue-chip crypto stands to benefit rather significantly from continued momentum in stablecoins. “Ethereum is the blockchain where the majority of stablecoin payments are transacted … and thus, ETH should benefit from this growth,” Fundstrat’s senior expert argued in a statement on Monday. Similar to Strategy’s “BTC Yield”, BMNR will use ETH held per share as a key performance metric moving forward, he added. Is BMNR the only one turning to Ethereum as a reserve asset? Tom Lee expects stablecoins to see accelerated adoption ahead as they’ve successfully established themselves as “the ChatGPT of crypto.” According to him, BitMine will use “a combination of reinvestment of the company’s cash flows and capital markets activities” to increase the value of Ethereum held per company share. Note that BMNR is not alone in looking past Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset. Earlier this year, betting firm SharpLink Gaming announced a similar initiative as well. At the time, SBET shares soared to a high of about $60. However, they’ve pared back their entire gains in June and are currently going for about $9 and change. Lee sees massive upside potential in the ETH price by year-end While Ethereum has not been nearly as exciting for investors in recent years as BTC, Fundstrat’s Tom Lee remains bullish as ever on the world’s second-largest crypto by market cap. Lee continues to believe that ETH will hit $5,000 by the end of this year, which signals potential upside of more than 100% for the cryptocurrency from current levels. According to the world-renowned strategist, improving regulatory backdrop, growing institutional interest, and now the continued momentum in stablecoin adoption could help Ethereum prices pop significantly in the back half of 2025. Such a sharp increase in ETH could prove a major tailwind for BitMine Immersion Technologies, given the LA headquartered firm’s pivot to buying Ethereum to use it as its primary treasury reserve asset.

2025-06-30T14:47:24,"Bitcoin to below $100,000 now possible as BTC flashes death cross","Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) attempt to reclaim the $110,000 mark appears to have stalled, with technical indicators suggesting a possible correction may be underway. In this case, Bitcoin is facing strong resistance near the descending trendline around $109,000. This level has opened the door for a potential pullback below the psychological $100,000 threshold, according to a June 30 analysis by crypto analyst Ali Martinez. The most concerning signal comes from the Stochastic RSI , which has flashed a bearish death cross , a pattern that occurs when the fast stochastic line crosses below the slow line in overbought territory. This typically signals weakening bullish momentum and growing downside pressure. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/Ali_charts Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also retreating from recent highs, further reinforcing signs that upward momentum is fading. The failure to break above key resistance, combined with these bearish technical patterns, significantly increases the likelihood of a deeper correction. If Bitcoin remains below this resistance zone, a retest of the $100,000 level, a zone that previously served as major support, looks increasingly probable. Unless bulls can reclaim $109,000 with strong volume and a daily close above, the risk of further downside looms as July begins. Bitcoin’s price next trajectory Adding to the outlook, crypto analyst Lenaert Snyder shared his perspective on X on June 30. He noted that Bitcoin’s rejection at $108,600 has stalled its recent rally and could now lead either to a pullback or another attempt at a breakout. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Snyder pointed to a broad green demand area below current levels, suggesting that if Bitcoin retraces, it may find support between $101,000 and $103,000 before potentially rebounding. He also warned that the market may need to flush out overleveraged long positions to reset sentiment, though the depth of any correction remains uncertain. Bitcoin price analysis At press time, Bitcoin was consolidating, trading at $107,570, down about 0.5% over the past 24 hours. However, on the weekly chart, the maiden cryptocurrency remains in positive territory, up around 0.41%. Bitcoin seven-day price chart.

While the monthly chart remains muted, up just 1.06%, technical structure on the daily timeframe is starting to take shape. Renowned analyst Merlijn The Trader has spotted a bull flag, a classic continuation pattern, on the BTC daily chart. The setup began with the vertical “flagpole” from $74,000 to $110,000, formed in April and May. Since then, price action has consolidated into a descending channel, creating the flag formation. $BTC IS READY TO BREAK FREE Bull flag formed. MACD just flipped. Target: $144,000 Front-run the breakout or FOMO in late. pic.twitter.com/mfuZf4gfdN — Merlijn The Trader (@MerlijnTrader) June 28, 2025 BTC recently poked above this descending range, suggesting that the next leg higher may be underway. Using standard measured move calculations, the flag projects a breakout target near $144,000, a 34% move from current levels. MACD Buy Signal Backs the Bullish Case Beyond the breakout structure, the MACD indicator is flashing a new bullish crossover, its first since early June. The MACD line has crossed above the signal line just as BTC tested the upper end of its consolidation zone, reinforcing the breakout potential. Technical Highlights: Pattern Target: $144,000 Breakout Trigger: Close above $109,000 MACD Crossover: First bullish signal in weeks Immediate Support: 50 EMA at $107,347 That said, a sustained push above $109,000 is still needed to validate the pattern. Without confirmation, Bitcoin risks falling back into range-bound trading. Bitcoin Key Levels and Trade Setup to Watch BTC remains confined within a narrow band between $106,450 and $108,980. The 50-period EMA at $107,347 is acting as near-term support, but repeated rejections below $109,000 show hesitation. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview MACD histogram momentum is still flat, so traders should watch for volume confirmation before taking breakout trades. Trade Setup Suggestion: Buy Trigger: Daily close above $109,000 Stop Loss: Below $106,450 Target 1: $110,448 Target 2: $111,944 Downside levels: If BTC fails and closes below $106,450, the following supports lie at $104,687 and $102,979. Bitcoin Outlook: Momentum Building, But Patience Required While BTC hasn’t yet confirmed a full breakout, the alignment of a bull flag structure with a fresh MACD buy signal suggests the market could be setting up for a bigger move. If $109,000 is cleared with strong follow-through, $144K becomes a valid technical target. Until a clear breakout occurs, the Bitcoin price prediction signals a neutral bias in the short run, but a bullish structure is intact. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Surges Past $1.74M as Price Rise Nears Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), has surpassed $1.74 million in its public presale, with $1,748,091.98 raised out of a $1,974,249 target.

2025-06-30T14:30:10,"Bit Digital: The Bitcoin Exit Is Real","Summary Bit Digital is pivoting away from Bitcoin mining toward high-margin ETH staking, and HPC services, transforming its revenue mix and growth strategy. The $150M equity raise will fund ETH purchases for treasury and WhiteFiber HPC expansion, but introduces dilution and ETH concentration risk. WhiteFiber's potential IPO could unlock value for BTBT shareholders, either through direct share distribution or a sum-of-the-parts re-rating. At 2x P/S and ~$2/share, with management insider buying and a clear strategic shift, BTBT offers an attractive risk/reward and is rated Buy. Before now, Bit Digital Inc. ( BTBT ) hadn't been on the list of my favorite Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miners these past years for a concrete reason: they relied heavily on third-party hosting partners. Their aggressive outsourcing was creating operational hiccups almost every other quarter. This third-party infrastructure reliance seemed efficient on the surface and offered an asset-light growth model (or so it seemed), but in reality, it meant vulnerability to counterparty risks and external disruptions. This vulnerability has held true in the documented history of Bit Digital’s operations, which has included forced relocations , hosting partner shutdowns , and even infrastructure fires that knocked significant capacity offline. All the aforementioned incidents are directly linked to reliance on external hosting providers. That said, Bit Digital now seems determined to put those bad days behind and is slowly exiting the messiness that came with Bitcoin mining - as the Q1 financials sales composition shows. In this piece, I’ll take a look at the Q1 highlights released in May, and see what’s really changed under the hood, and what’s next following the $150 million offering priced at $2 that sent the stock spiraling last week, now finding a floor around the offering price. Mining Takes a Backseat at Bit Digital Q1 results showed a 17% YoY decline in total revenue, but the real story is the shrinking sales Bit Digital generated from digital assets mining, which declined by ~64% YoY. This is the main indication of the company’s gradual pivot away from Bitcoin mining. The decline in digital asset mining revenue wasn't a one-off in Q1; it has been a trend for Bit Digital since last year. Q1 FY25 revenue (10 Q) Since Q2 FY24, the numbers show that the company is steadily backing away from Bitcoin mining. Digital asset mining revenue dropped from $16.1 million in Q2 last year to $10.1 million in Q3, then around $13 million in Q4, before crashing to just $7.8 million in Q1 this year. The decline in the digital asset mining sales numbers wasn’t as a result of an absolute decline in Bit Digital’s total revenue numbers. As the trend reveals, the digital asset mining segment’s contribution as a percentage of total revenue fell from 55% in Q2 last year to 44% in Q3, then down another 400 bps to 40% in Q4 last year, and finally down to 31% in Q1 this year. The trend shows it is a clear, measured retreat from digital asset mining. Mining is no longer at the center of Bit Digital’s growth strategy; scalable lines like ETH staking, GPU cloud, and colocation services have taken over the revenue mix. Author Bit Digital's revenue mix from the company’s other segments paints a vivid picture of this evolving strategy. Looking at the comparable periods from the Q1 results and last year's Q1, we see a remarkable surge in these other segments. ETH staking revenue (a new yield-generating income stream for the company, which we’ll get to in details down the line) witnessed an impressive 72% climb from $325k in Q1 last year to $561k in Q1 this year; ETH staking is in particular an interesting business line because of its low cost of revenue, resulting in a higher gross margin. Cloud Services revenue grew by 83.92% from $8.01 million in Q1 last year to $14.8 million in Q1 this year. Furthermore, Colocation Services revenue, a relatively nascent but rapidly growing segment for the company following our acquisition of Enovum in late 2024, grew from $0 in Q1 2024 to $1.6 million in Q1 2025. Q1 FY25 balance sheet (10 Q) The balance sheet shows significant cash depletion in Q1, with cash and cash equivalents decreasing by $36.7 million and digital assets decreased by $82.3 million sequentially, making total current assets decrease by $108 million in Q1. Investors who have been following Bit Digital are aware of the capital shift the company began as it scaled the HPC business line under the new brand WhiteFiber in Q1. While current assets decreased in Q1, non-current assets increased, mainly in property, plant and equipment, pointing to investments related to HPC expansion already underway, likely in GPU hardware or other preps for WhiteFiber. I anticipate a similar trend for the Q2 balance sheet, with an expected decrease in liquid assets because of the $45 million spent early this month, among other investments, for the recently acquired 1 million square foot North Carolina site for WhiteFiber. Though Bit Digital plans to refinance the NC property by taking out a mortgage, there is still near-term liquidity drain to be anticipated. Q1 FY25 cashflow (10 Q) Though operations generated cash flow of $17.4 million in Q1, the heavy investing activities of $65 million (mostly tied to the CapEx and early infrastructure ramp-up for WhiteFiber mentioned earlier) and $9.4 million in financing activities meant that there was a net cash burn of $38.2 million. With $58.6 million in cash and cash equivalents (excluding restricted cash) as of Q1 end, Bit Digital’s cash runway faces the potential to be further strained in Q2 if we consider net outflows in the $35–45 million range continuing along with the $45 million already committed to WhiteFiber’s North Carolina site acquisition in Q2. Equity is Bit Digital’s Lifeline Debt has remained manageable at Bit Digital with a total debt of $14 million and a debt-to-equity ratio (debt divided by total shareholders’ equity) of 0.3 currently. Shareholders' equity was $147.4 million as of Q1 end. A further look into the leverage ratio by considering total liabilities of $67.8 million, and not just interest-bearing debt of $14 million, we still get a debt-to-equity of 0.12. Both debt-to-equity calculations based on interest-bearing debt and total liabilities as numerators show that Bit Digital has enough balance sheet health. The weight of debt in the company's capital structure is almost negligible. However, with the current expansion and the ongoing cash burn I highlighted in the preceding section of this article, it is no surprise that Bit Digital currently relies on a mix of equity-driven funding options. Hence, the 75 million shares offering priced at $2 for gross proceeds of $150 million was announced last week. There is also an active $500 million ATM , of which $48 million was raised post-Q1 (the $48 million ATM raise was disclosed in the Q1 earnings call ). Bit Digital has said the $150 million equity offering priced at $2 per share will be mostly used for the purchase of Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) as a corporate treasury asset. Previously in this piece, I mentioned ETH staking as an interesting stream of revenue because of its low cost of revenue and high gross margin compared to the other revenue streams. Doubling down on purchasing more ETH for treasury assets with the planned $150 million raise is a bold bet and gives potential yield generation from staking, but investors should be aware that this also creates a concentration risk with ETH, and BTBT will potentially be more closely tied to ETH price volatility. If the allocation to ETH ends up accounting for a higher share of revenue contribution, a good quarter in other operating segments could be distorted by a poor price performance from ETH. Data by YCharts Bit Digital isn't the most expensive digital asset miner at the moment, trading at 2x P/Sales and around 1.0 to book value. Among mining peers compared in the preceding chart, BTBT trades at the lowest multiple to sales and book value. The clear pivot to HPC has been followed by clear steps like the formal structuring of the business into WhiteFiber and the 1 million square foot site acquisition, which shows an impressive level of strategic commitment and capital deployment, and are the attractions here, in my view. Yes, there are ongoing dilution risks moving forward, but for a good portion of this capital cycle, the equity financings aren’t emergency raises yet. They are to fund the clear ETH treasury strategy and build out WhiteFiber into a full-scale HPC infrastructure asset. Bit Digital’s WhiteFiber carve-out got more interesting when an 8-K filing earlier this month hinted at the potential for WhiteFiber to become an independent public company through an IPO, and that process is well underway as Bit Digital submitted a confidential S-1 that included a draft registration statement with the SEC last week. There are potential outcomes that could play out that will potentially benefit existing BTBT shareholders if the IPO happens. First, BTBT shareholders could receive pro-rata shares in WhiteFiber post-IPO, giving them direct exposure to a potential fresh high-growth valuation. Then, even if WhiteFiber shares aren't distributed to BTBT shareholders but Bit Digital retains majority ownership of WhiteFiber, the separate listing would support a sum-of-the-parts re-rating for BTBT. Either path would allow BTBT investors to see the value of WhiteFiber more clearly reflected in BTBT’s market valuation. And I believe Bit Digital’s management will not want to put existing shareholders underwater with their decisions. The insider share accumulation has also increased lately at Bit Digital. The CEO has raised his holdings to over 2.1 million shares after purchasing 750,000 shares of the company's stock at $2.00 per share, disclosed in a Form 4 filing last week . This, I believe, strengthens alignment between management’s interests and those of shareholders. At 2x P/S and ~$2 per share, down 31% YTD, I believe BTBT is worth a Buy. The company’s pivot to both HPC and ETH treasury is transformational. Investors should not forget the potential for ongoing dilution and the growing concentration risk from ETH exposure. But at these levels, the risk/reward looks increasingly attractive. Trading at a modest 2x P/S with solid execution while undergoing a transforming business model, the market may still be pricing in the older, miner-only version of Bit Digital. This leaves room for a potential re-rating.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4798301-bit-digital-bitcoin-exit-real?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BUSINESS|ETH|MINING|BTC|REGULATION","BTC-USD|ETH-USD|BTBT",cryptocompare
2025-06-30T14:30:09,"Solana Forms Bullish Flag On Daily Chart — Breakout Imminent?","Solana is displaying signs of strength as it trades with a key chart pattern, which indicates that the altcoin is preparing for a solid move. The price has been holding steady, forming lower highs and higher lows within a narrowing range. This pause in momentum could be setting the stage for another breakout. Key Resistance Levels In Focus As Breakout Approaches Solana has developed a bullish flag pattern on the daily chart, signaling a continuation of its uptrend. According to Dynamite Trader’s post on X, this pattern often precedes strong breakouts, suggesting that momentum could soon accelerate. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Breakout Watch: Price Could Rally Hard Above $150 Level? Currently, SOL’s price is holding above the midline of the flag, indicating underlying strength. However, it’s also testing the daily 100 moving average (MA100), which is acting as a dynamic resistance. SOL’s reaction to this level will be crucial in determining whether the bullish flag leads to a decisive breakout or a deeper consolidation. Another analyst, Henry, highlighted that Solana is gearing up for a big move after completing a clean Cup and Handle breakout on the 4-hour chart, a bullish pattern that signals continuation. The breakout saw SOL flip the $149 resistance into support, a key technical shift. If this level holds, Henry sees a rally toward the $168 to $174 zone, which aligns with previous resistance levels and bullish extension targets. He adds a warning that volatility is increasing, and high-leverage positions are at risk on both sides. Solana is setting up a clean wedge on the weekly chart. Currently trading at $150, SOL has been consistently bouncing between support and resistance levels, which is known for building pressure before delivering sharp moves. Talking about this, Top G emphasizes that if this plays out as expected, the next leg up could be significant, and $300 isn’t just speculation; it’s a realistic target based on the structure and behavior. Holding Above The Breakout Zone Could Accelerate The Move Upward Solana has broken above the downtrend line on the 4-hour chart. This move could mark a pivotal shift in short-term momentum, with potential bullish continuation if current levels hold. Related Reading: Solana Price At ‘A Very Delicate Level’ – Analyst Says $148 Reclaim Is Key If SOL maintains its position above this trend line, crypto analyst Bens BTC noted that the price could climb toward the next resistance area at $165. The price action is forming a bullish structure, and momentum indicators may soon align with the breakout, further supporting the continuation of the upside. The asset had broken out with strong momentum and is now trading firmly within a long-term bullish channel, a structure that has supported uptrends. The price action looks clean, with higher highs and higher lows forming as SOL surges upward. Furthermore, analyst Persis10t revealed that momentum is picking up, and as long as the channel remains intact, the path forward could be explosive. If the structure holds and attracts volume, Persis10t projects a target of $700+ in the next run, pointing to the upper boundary of the bullish channel as a magnet for price.

MANTA Chart on TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, Manta’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.155, resulting in a correction to $0.139. Is MANTA a good investment? Manta’s rapid rise in DeFi TVL charts and alignment with Ethereum ‘s scaling roadmap via technologies like Manta Pacific suggest $MANTA’s potential.

In recent months, the Manta network expanded its offerings and established multiple partnerships. If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $10 mark. Will Manta reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment, the MNT price might take several years to reach the $100 milestone. We expect the Manta price to achieve $100 by 2060. Will Manta reach $1000? $1000 is a distant dream for Manta price. However, if everything remains in favor of the altcoin market, we might even see the MNT price hitting $1K. Is Manta a good long-term investment? Investors are bullish on Manta, which has gained significant attention in recent months. If developers continue to build robust utilities for Manta and the roadmap fulfills user demand, it can be a good long-term investment option.
