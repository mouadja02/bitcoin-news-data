2025-06-30T15:30:00,"Avalanche price prediction 2025-2031: Time to buy AVAX?","Key takeaways: Our Avalanche price prediction anticipates a high of $33.36 in 2025. In 2027, it will range between $59.93 and $71.39, with an average price of $61.59. In 2031, it will range between $267.69 and $326.17, with an average price of $277.23. AVAX exhibited wild price swings in 2024. This record came as the crypto market valuation peaked. It later reversed, shedding some of the profits in 2025. While the Avalanche ecosystem has been making strides, the AVAX price has left investors particularly questioning its trajectory. Will AVAX go up? Is AVAX a good investment? Let’s explore these and more in our Cryptopolitan price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Avalanche Symbol AVAX Current price $17.99 Market cap $7.59B Trading volume $262.03M Circulating supply 422.09M All-time high $146.22 on Nov 21, 2021 All-time low $2.79 on Dec 31, 2020 24-hour high $18.86 24-hour low $17.84 Avalanche price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day variation) 8.10% 50-day SMA $21.09 200-day SMA $22.92 Sentiment Bearish Green days 15/30 (50%) Avalanche price analysis As of June 30, AVAX’s price rose by 0.03% in 24 hours and dropped by 12.15% in the last 30 days. Its trading volume rose by 68.42% in 24 hours. AVAX/USD 1-day chart analysis AVAX/USD 1-day chart AVAX was in an ascending channel in the last quarter of 2024. The trend reversed in December, after reaching a high of $55.41 on Christmas Eve. The drop continued into 2025 and is yet to reverse. Last month, the coin attempted a recovery which saw it rise from a low of $19.09 to as high as $26.84. This month, it fell back below $19.00. The William Alligator trendlines now show that its volatility is dropping. The relative strength index is at 43.94 in neutral territory, with the MACD histogram showing positive market momentum. AVAX/USD 4-hour chart analysis AVAX/USD 4-hour chart The 4-hour chart highlights AVAX’s current run, which is consolidating. Like the daily chart, its RSI is in neutral territory at 52.09; the William Alligator trendlines show falling price volatility.

The combination of technical indicators and chart analysis suggests that Avalanche is bearish with dropping volatility. Chart analysis shows it will trade sideways over the short term. Recent news Filecoin Foundation and Avalanche have partnered to launch a new cross-chain data bridge. The bridge will allow developers to build on Avalanche’s C-Chain to store data on Filecoin’s decentralized network. Why is AVAX down? AVAX is correcting from its highest last year; the crypto market capitalization is also bearish. The drop in AVAX value could be attributed to the general market sentiment. Will AVAX reach $50? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, AVAX crossed the $50 mark in 2027. Will AVAX reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, AVAX will reach $100 in 2028, with a maximum price of $106.00 for the year. Can Avalanche reach $1,000? It remains highly unlikely that AVAX will cross the $1,000 mark before 2031. At that market capitalization, it could be more valuable than Ethereum. Can Avalanche reach $10,000? It remains highly unlikely that AVAX will cross the $10,000 mark before 2031. How much will Avalanche be worth in 2025? As the second half of 2025 unfolds, we anticipate it will trade between $19.06 and $33.36, with an average price of $29.46. Does Avalanche have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, AVAX will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or negative regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is Avalanche a good crypto to buy? Chart analysis suggests that Avalanche is recovering and currently gearing up for a closer move to $27 despite the overall bearish momentum.

Image source: CoinStats In July 2020, Avalanche completed its public sale, raising $42 million in less than $4.5 hours. The tokens were distributed after the mainnet launch in September. On Dec 31, 2020, it fell to an all-time low of $2.788. In September 2021, the Ava Labs Foundation received a $230 million investment from Polychain and Three Arrows Capital Group by purchasing the AVAX cryptocurrency. In November 2021, following an agreement with Deloitte to improve US disaster relief funding, AVAX moved to the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. At that time, AVAX moved to its all-time high at $146.22. In Aug 2022, a whistleblower, ‘crypto leaks’, published a report accusing Ava Labs of secret deals with a law firm to destabilize its competitors. Ava Labs CEO Emin Gün Sirer denied any dirty deal with Roche Freedmen law firm. In 2023, AVAX maintained a bullish trend between January and May, after which bears overwhelmed the market. It resumed the positive momentum in October, rising to $49.96 In 2024, it crossed the $60 mark in March. The rise coincided with a record high in AVAX inscriptions, with over 100 million ASC-20 minted since their introduction in June 2023. The uptrend reversed in April 2024; by July, it had fallen to $24.40. In August, it was at $21, and in September and October, it was at $27. It turned bullish in November 2024, rising from as low as $23 to as high as $55 in December. It later corrected and traded at $42 into 2025. The drop continued into January; by June, it had fallen below $20.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/avalanche-price-prediction/,"AVAX|TRADING|MARKET|ICO|BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY|FIL|REGULATION|BTC|BUSINESS","Crypto Price Predictions|avax",cryptocompare

2025-06-30T15:27:46,"Areta: Crypto M&A tops $40b in 2025 as buyers seek scale and speed","With over 40 billion-dollar deals closed this year, crypto mergers have surged past anything the market has seen before. Areta co-founders trace the forces pushing institutional buyers to pick “buy” over “build” at a record pace. At a June 30 conference session during ETHCC 8, Areta co-founders Karl-Martin Ahrend and Jan-Philip Grabs walked attendees through what they described as the most active year in crypto M&A history. Drawing from their advisory work with major players including Robinhood, Swift, and MoonPay, the duo outlined the seismic shift driving 2025’s unprecedented M&A boom, revealing how regulatory clarity and institutional FOMO have turned acquisitions into crypto’s dominant growth strategy. The numbers speak for themselves: this year’s deal volume has already eclipsed all previous years combined, with trading infrastructure, staking, payments, and on-chain deals leading the charge. You might also like: Strategy joins Russell Top 200 Value Index with $64b BTC on the books The four fronts driving crypto’s acquisition frenzy The breakneck pace of crypto M&A isn’t accidental. Behind the 40+ billion-dollar deals of 2025 lie four strategic battlegrounds where acquirers are fighting for dominance: Trading platforms have become prime targets, not for retail user bases, but for regulatory licenses and institutional infrastructure. When Robinhood acquired Bitstamp earlier this year, insiders saw it as a regulatory power play. The acquisition gave Robinhood instant access to dozens of jurisdictions and a turnkey institutional trading desk. Similar moves by Coinbase and Swift reflect a new reality: compliance capabilities are now the competitive moat in crypto’s regulated future. “You’ve seen Robinhood acquiring Bitstamp to increase their licensing footprint around the globe and also add institutional trading capabilities.” Karl-Martin Ahrend noted. Swift has acquired AZ crypto… to obviously consolidate user numbers and create significant synergies between the two businesses.” The quiet consolidation in staking services tells another part of the story. As proof-of-stake networks now secure the majority of crypto’s value, control over validation operations has emerged as a strategic imperative. Firms like Source Strategies are absorbing smaller validators, such as Solana-native players, to bring key operations in-house. The goal across the board is vertical control, faster deployment, and future-proofing in an increasingly competitive arena. At the same time, payment processors are racing to own the entire stablecoin value chain, from issuance to settlement. Stripe’s acquisition of Preview and MoonPay’s European shopping spree reveal a clear pattern: companies are internalizing every step of crypto payments to capture this booming market. With nearly 80% of crypto businesses now using stablecoins for B2B transactions, these moves represent bets on crypto’s future as a mainstream payment rail rather than just a speculative asset. Perhaps the most radical development is unfolding transparently on blockchain ledgers themselves. The rise of token-based acquisitions, like Enzyme’s all-token purchase of Microfinance, shows how decentralized organizations are rewriting the M&A playbook. But as Areta’s Jan-Philip Grabs noted during the presentation, “Unlike in more traditional M&A deals… you’re really lacking the clear framework and processes.” These on-chain mergers face unique challenges, from community governance hurdles to untested legal ground, yet they point toward a future where blockchain-native dealmaking becomes commonplace.

2025-06-30T15:25:09,"What Should Be the Percentage of Bitcoin (BTC) in Portfolios? Experienced Analyst Peter Brandt Reveals the Best BTC Strategy!","Experienced analyst Peter Brandt, who is followed by investors with his analyses of Bitcoin (BTC) and the cryptocurrency market, made a new post. Peter Brandt, who explains to investors how the ideal portfolio allocation should be with his 50 years of experience, argued that trading is the wrong path and choice for 95% of people. Brandt, who notes that some people need to focus on real-world skills rather than trading on screen or making quick profits, recommends monthly investment. Stating that people should focus on their daily lives at this point, the master analyst recommends investing 80% in S&P 500 and 20% in Bitcoin. Peter Brandt’s portfolio allocation is not a sign of an anti-Bitcoin stance. It is actually a clear sign that Brandt still sees BTC as an important part of his long-term portfolio strategy and values Bitcoin. Peter Brandt’s message here seems to be one of balance. While the analyst thinks Bitcoin is an ideal asset for making money in the long term, he argues that BTC should not be at the center of investments.

Brandt reminded that there is a potential for the formation of the double top pattern that Bitcoin followed in 2022 and resulted in a major 75% drop, and a 75% correction. According to the pattern, a double top at $ 110,000 was formed, and a low level of $ 75,000 was taken as the basis before the second peak was formed. In this context, according to the analyst, if BTC breaks below $ 75,000, this means that a double top pattern has formed and could lead to a 75% drop from the peak.

2025-06-30T15:19:43,"John Deaton Says Wall Street Greed Could Push XRP, ETH & SOL Into Treasuries","The post John Deaton Says Wall Street Greed Could Push XRP, ETH & SOL Into Treasuries appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Years ago, when John E Deaton, a well-known crypto advocate and legal voice in the XRP community, predicted that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and corporate crypto treasuries would expand beyond Bitcoin, many laughed! But today, those predictions are becoming reality—and fast. Now, again, Deaton says that Wall Street’s greed could make XRP, ETH, and SOL the next big treasury assets. Deaton’s “Greed Theory” Playing Out Deaton had one simple theory : Wall Street is too greedy to sit back and let only a few players profit from crypto. Earlier, Deaton said Wall Street would never let Michael Saylor be the only one using Bitcoin as a treasury strategy. According to Deaton, there are now between 60 and 100 companies that have implemented a Bitcoin treasury strategy. He believed the same would happen with other tokens too, once Bitcoin’s treasury strategy worked, others wanted in — and not just with Bitcoin. Meanwhile, companies are now adding ETH, XRP, and SOL to their corporate balance sheets to gain an edge. Who’s Holding XRP as a Treasury Asset? Deaton points out that at least five companies have already been betting on XRP’s treasury strategy : VivoPower International has raised $121 million for a $100 million XRP treasury plan, with strong backing from Saudi investors and advice from a former SBI Ripple Asia executive. Worksport Ltd., an American car parts company, set aside $5 million — or 10% of its spare cash — for XRP and Bitcoin. Hyperscale Data Inc. plans to launch an XRP lending platform by late 2025, listing XRP directly on its accounts. Webus International Limited , a Chinese company, partnered with Samara Alpha Management to manage a $300 million XRP treasury for cross-border payments. Wellgistics Health, Inc. uses XRP in its treasury to speed up payments in healthcare and avoid banking delays. It’s Not Just XRP — ETH and SOL Too Deaton pointed out that at least two companies now hold ETH as a treasury strategy, including Fundstrat and SharpLink Gaming, which has a $425 million ETH position supported by Consensys, Ethereum’s co-founder, Joseph Lubin’s company. For Solana, the list is growing too: Upexi raised $100 million for a Solana treasury. DeFi Development Corp saw its shares surge 3,000% after announcing SOL purchases. Sol Strategies has launched as a Solana treasury company, getting support from major firms like Cantor Fitzgerald. An unnamed EdTech company also plans to raise $500 million to hold SOL. Wall Street’s Hunger For Profit Meanwhile, Deaton said that this wasn’t just about XRP, Ethereum, or Solana—it was about understanding human behavior, the hunger for returns, and the inevitability of crypto adoption in corporate finance. As Deaton puts it, his predictions weren’t about specific cryptocurrencies, but about how people—and especially Wall Street—respond when they smell opportunity.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/john-deaton-says-wall-street-greed-could-push-xrp-eth-sol-into-treasuries/,"XRP|REGULATION|SOL|ETH|BTC","News",cryptocompare

Vlad Tenev, CEO and chairman of Robinhood, announced today at Robinhood Presents: To Catch a Token event in Cannes, France, that the firm is launching US stock and exchange-traded fund (ETF) tokens . “Our latest offerings lay the groundwork for crypto to become the backbone of the global financial system,” Tenev stated. Tomorrow. 5PM CEST. https://t.co/17NfkTzssx — Vlad Tenev (@vladtenev) June 29, 2025 EU Customers Gain Exposure to Tokenized US Stocks Tenev elaborated that Robinhood will provide eligible customers in the European Union (EU) with exposure to US equities through “Robinhood Stock Tokens.” He explained that the tokens will feature zero commissions or additional spreads from Robinhood (although other fees may apply), while providing full support and 24-hour access. “With tokenized stocks, our European app transitions from being a crypto-only app to an all-in-one investment app powered by crypto,” Tenev said. Robinhood will provide European customers with access to over 200 US stock and ETF tokens. Stock token holders will also be able to receive dividend payments directly in the Robinhood app. Source: Robinhood Robinhood’s Layer-2 Remains in Development Tenev further added that stock tokens will initially be issued on the Ethereum layer-2 (L2) platform, Arbitrum. Moving forward, he noted that the tokenized stocks will be facilitated by Robinhood’s own L2 blockchain, based on Arbitrum . Robinhood’s blockchain will be optimized for tokenized real-world assets and built to support 24/7 trading, seamless bridging, and self-custody. According to a Bloomberg report published on May 7, Robinhood has been planning to launch its blockchain-based platform to allow users in Europe to trade US securities. Robinhood Rolls Out Perpetual Futures Additionally, Robinhood has introduced crypto perpetual futures in the EU. According to Tenev, the platform will offer eligible customers access to a new class of derivatives, with continuous exposure and up to 3x leverage. He shared that perpetuals will be fully rolled out to eligible customers by the end of summer 2025. “Designed to help reduce the complexity typically associated with trading perpetuals, we built our interface with intuitive controls for setting position size and managing margin,” he said. Orders will be routed through Bitstamp’s perpetual futures exchange. Earlier in June, Robinhood announced it had completed a $200 million acquisition of crypto exchange Bitstamp . This allowed the fintech to secure more than 50 licenses and registrations worldwide. Although Robinhood announced its entry into crypto futures last July, the company said the rollout would initially be limited to Bitcoin ( BTC) and Ether ( ETH ). Crypto Staking Launches in the US Robinhood is also launching crypto staking for eligible US customers. The platform will begin with staking on Ethereum and Solana (SOL). Crypto staking was made available to all Robinhood customers in the EU and EEA last year. Elaborating on Robinhood’s new products, Tenev stated that for a limited time, both US and EU investors can transfer crypto into the Robinhood app to earn a 1% deposit boost. Investors will also have the chance to double their boost to 2% if the total deposits reach a goal of $500 million.

2025-06-30T14:58:56,"Tom Lee picks Ether over Bitcoin as primary treasury reserve asset: find out more","Fundstrat’s head of research, Tom Lee, wants to transform an under-the-radar crypto miner, BitMine Immersion Technologies, into the biggest publicly traded holder of Ethereum. On Monday, the BTC miner named Lee as its chairman of the board and announced plans to raise $250 million via a private placement as well. In its press release , the company confirmed that it will use proceeds from this private placement to buy Ether, adding that the crypto will begin serving as its primary treasury reserve asset over time. Note that the Ethereum price is currently up 70% versus its year-to-date low in early April. Why is Tom Lee onboard with BitMine’s ETH strategy? Lee is joining BitMine as its chairman at a time when the Senate’s approval of the “ GENIUS Act ” is driving unprecedented demand for stablecoins. He’s onboard with the company’s Ethereum strategy as the blue-chip crypto stands to benefit rather significantly from continued momentum in stablecoins. “Ethereum is the blockchain where the majority of stablecoin payments are transacted … and thus, ETH should benefit from this growth,” Fundstrat’s senior expert argued in a statement on Monday. Similar to Strategy’s “BTC Yield”, BMNR will use ETH held per share as a key performance metric moving forward, he added. Is BMNR the only one turning to Ethereum as a reserve asset? Tom Lee expects stablecoins to see accelerated adoption ahead as they’ve successfully established themselves as “the ChatGPT of crypto.” According to him, BitMine will use “a combination of reinvestment of the company’s cash flows and capital markets activities” to increase the value of Ethereum held per company share. Note that BMNR is not alone in looking past Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset. Earlier this year, betting firm SharpLink Gaming announced a similar initiative as well. At the time, SBET shares soared to a high of about $60. However, they’ve pared back their entire gains in June and are currently going for about $9 and change. Lee sees massive upside potential in the ETH price by year-end While Ethereum has not been nearly as exciting for investors in recent years as BTC, Fundstrat’s Tom Lee remains bullish as ever on the world’s second-largest crypto by market cap. Lee continues to believe that ETH will hit $5,000 by the end of this year, which signals potential upside of more than 100% for the cryptocurrency from current levels. According to the world-renowned strategist, improving regulatory backdrop, growing institutional interest, and now the continued momentum in stablecoin adoption could help Ethereum prices pop significantly in the back half of 2025. Such a sharp increase in ETH could prove a major tailwind for BitMine Immersion Technologies, given the LA headquartered firm’s pivot to buying Ethereum to use it as its primary treasury reserve asset.

2025-06-30T14:47:24,"Bitcoin to below $100,000 now possible as BTC flashes death cross","Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) attempt to reclaim the $110,000 mark appears to have stalled, with technical indicators suggesting a possible correction may be underway. In this case, Bitcoin is facing strong resistance near the descending trendline around $109,000. This level has opened the door for a potential pullback below the psychological $100,000 threshold, according to a June 30 analysis by crypto analyst Ali Martinez. The most concerning signal comes from the Stochastic RSI , which has flashed a bearish death cross , a pattern that occurs when the fast stochastic line crosses below the slow line in overbought territory. This typically signals weakening bullish momentum and growing downside pressure. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/Ali_charts Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also retreating from recent highs, further reinforcing signs that upward momentum is fading. The failure to break above key resistance, combined with these bearish technical patterns, significantly increases the likelihood of a deeper correction. If Bitcoin remains below this resistance zone, a retest of the $100,000 level, a zone that previously served as major support, looks increasingly probable. Unless bulls can reclaim $109,000 with strong volume and a daily close above, the risk of further downside looms as July begins. Bitcoin’s price next trajectory Adding to the outlook, crypto analyst Lenaert Snyder shared his perspective on X on June 30. He noted that Bitcoin’s rejection at $108,600 has stalled its recent rally and could now lead either to a pullback or another attempt at a breakout. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Snyder pointed to a broad green demand area below current levels, suggesting that if Bitcoin retraces, it may find support between $101,000 and $103,000 before potentially rebounding. He also warned that the market may need to flush out overleveraged long positions to reset sentiment, though the depth of any correction remains uncertain. Bitcoin price analysis At press time, Bitcoin was consolidating, trading at $107,570, down about 0.5% over the past 24 hours. However, on the weekly chart, the maiden cryptocurrency remains in positive territory, up around 0.41%. Bitcoin seven-day price chart.

While the monthly chart remains muted, up just 1.06%, technical structure on the daily timeframe is starting to take shape. Renowned analyst Merlijn The Trader has spotted a bull flag, a classic continuation pattern, on the BTC daily chart. The setup began with the vertical “flagpole” from $74,000 to $110,000, formed in April and May. Since then, price action has consolidated into a descending channel, creating the flag formation. $BTC IS READY TO BREAK FREE Bull flag formed. MACD just flipped. Target: $144,000 Front-run the breakout or FOMO in late. pic.twitter.com/mfuZf4gfdN — Merlijn The Trader (@MerlijnTrader) June 28, 2025 BTC recently poked above this descending range, suggesting that the next leg higher may be underway. Using standard measured move calculations, the flag projects a breakout target near $144,000, a 34% move from current levels. MACD Buy Signal Backs the Bullish Case Beyond the breakout structure, the MACD indicator is flashing a new bullish crossover, its first since early June. The MACD line has crossed above the signal line just as BTC tested the upper end of its consolidation zone, reinforcing the breakout potential. Technical Highlights: Pattern Target: $144,000 Breakout Trigger: Close above $109,000 MACD Crossover: First bullish signal in weeks Immediate Support: 50 EMA at $107,347 That said, a sustained push above $109,000 is still needed to validate the pattern. Without confirmation, Bitcoin risks falling back into range-bound trading. Bitcoin Key Levels and Trade Setup to Watch BTC remains confined within a narrow band between $106,450 and $108,980. The 50-period EMA at $107,347 is acting as near-term support, but repeated rejections below $109,000 show hesitation. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview MACD histogram momentum is still flat, so traders should watch for volume confirmation before taking breakout trades. Trade Setup Suggestion: Buy Trigger: Daily close above $109,000 Stop Loss: Below $106,450 Target 1: $110,448 Target 2: $111,944 Downside levels: If BTC fails and closes below $106,450, the following supports lie at $104,687 and $102,979. Bitcoin Outlook: Momentum Building, But Patience Required While BTC hasn’t yet confirmed a full breakout, the alignment of a bull flag structure with a fresh MACD buy signal suggests the market could be setting up for a bigger move. If $109,000 is cleared with strong follow-through, $144K becomes a valid technical target. Until a clear breakout occurs, the Bitcoin price prediction signals a neutral bias in the short run, but a bullish structure is intact. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Surges Past $1.74M as Price Rise Nears Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), has surpassed $1.74 million in its public presale, with $1,748,091.98 raised out of a $1,974,249 target.

2025-06-30T14:30:10,"Bit Digital: The Bitcoin Exit Is Real","Summary Bit Digital is pivoting away from Bitcoin mining toward high-margin ETH staking, and HPC services, transforming its revenue mix and growth strategy. The $150M equity raise will fund ETH purchases for treasury and WhiteFiber HPC expansion, but introduces dilution and ETH concentration risk. WhiteFiber's potential IPO could unlock value for BTBT shareholders, either through direct share distribution or a sum-of-the-parts re-rating. At 2x P/S and ~$2/share, with management insider buying and a clear strategic shift, BTBT offers an attractive risk/reward and is rated Buy. Before now, Bit Digital Inc. ( BTBT ) hadn't been on the list of my favorite Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miners these past years for a concrete reason: they relied heavily on third-party hosting partners. Their aggressive outsourcing was creating operational hiccups almost every other quarter. This third-party infrastructure reliance seemed efficient on the surface and offered an asset-light growth model (or so it seemed), but in reality, it meant vulnerability to counterparty risks and external disruptions. This vulnerability has held true in the documented history of Bit Digital’s operations, which has included forced relocations , hosting partner shutdowns , and even infrastructure fires that knocked significant capacity offline. All the aforementioned incidents are directly linked to reliance on external hosting providers. That said, Bit Digital now seems determined to put those bad days behind and is slowly exiting the messiness that came with Bitcoin mining - as the Q1 financials sales composition shows. In this piece, I’ll take a look at the Q1 highlights released in May, and see what’s really changed under the hood, and what’s next following the $150 million offering priced at $2 that sent the stock spiraling last week, now finding a floor around the offering price. Mining Takes a Backseat at Bit Digital Q1 results showed a 17% YoY decline in total revenue, but the real story is the shrinking sales Bit Digital generated from digital assets mining, which declined by ~64% YoY. This is the main indication of the company’s gradual pivot away from Bitcoin mining. The decline in digital asset mining revenue wasn't a one-off in Q1; it has been a trend for Bit Digital since last year. Q1 FY25 revenue (10 Q) Since Q2 FY24, the numbers show that the company is steadily backing away from Bitcoin mining. Digital asset mining revenue dropped from $16.1 million in Q2 last year to $10.1 million in Q3, then around $13 million in Q4, before crashing to just $7.8 million in Q1 this year. The decline in the digital asset mining sales numbers wasn’t as a result of an absolute decline in Bit Digital’s total revenue numbers. As the trend reveals, the digital asset mining segment’s contribution as a percentage of total revenue fell from 55% in Q2 last year to 44% in Q3, then down another 400 bps to 40% in Q4 last year, and finally down to 31% in Q1 this year. The trend shows it is a clear, measured retreat from digital asset mining. Mining is no longer at the center of Bit Digital’s growth strategy; scalable lines like ETH staking, GPU cloud, and colocation services have taken over the revenue mix. Author Bit Digital's revenue mix from the company’s other segments paints a vivid picture of this evolving strategy. Looking at the comparable periods from the Q1 results and last year's Q1, we see a remarkable surge in these other segments. ETH staking revenue (a new yield-generating income stream for the company, which we’ll get to in details down the line) witnessed an impressive 72% climb from $325k in Q1 last year to $561k in Q1 this year; ETH staking is in particular an interesting business line because of its low cost of revenue, resulting in a higher gross margin. Cloud Services revenue grew by 83.92% from $8.01 million in Q1 last year to $14.8 million in Q1 this year. Furthermore, Colocation Services revenue, a relatively nascent but rapidly growing segment for the company following our acquisition of Enovum in late 2024, grew from $0 in Q1 2024 to $1.6 million in Q1 2025. Q1 FY25 balance sheet (10 Q) The balance sheet shows significant cash depletion in Q1, with cash and cash equivalents decreasing by $36.7 million and digital assets decreased by $82.3 million sequentially, making total current assets decrease by $108 million in Q1. Investors who have been following Bit Digital are aware of the capital shift the company began as it scaled the HPC business line under the new brand WhiteFiber in Q1. While current assets decreased in Q1, non-current assets increased, mainly in property, plant and equipment, pointing to investments related to HPC expansion already underway, likely in GPU hardware or other preps for WhiteFiber. I anticipate a similar trend for the Q2 balance sheet, with an expected decrease in liquid assets because of the $45 million spent early this month, among other investments, for the recently acquired 1 million square foot North Carolina site for WhiteFiber. Though Bit Digital plans to refinance the NC property by taking out a mortgage, there is still near-term liquidity drain to be anticipated. Q1 FY25 cashflow (10 Q) Though operations generated cash flow of $17.4 million in Q1, the heavy investing activities of $65 million (mostly tied to the CapEx and early infrastructure ramp-up for WhiteFiber mentioned earlier) and $9.4 million in financing activities meant that there was a net cash burn of $38.2 million. With $58.6 million in cash and cash equivalents (excluding restricted cash) as of Q1 end, Bit Digital’s cash runway faces the potential to be further strained in Q2 if we consider net outflows in the $35–45 million range continuing along with the $45 million already committed to WhiteFiber’s North Carolina site acquisition in Q2. Equity is Bit Digital’s Lifeline Debt has remained manageable at Bit Digital with a total debt of $14 million and a debt-to-equity ratio (debt divided by total shareholders’ equity) of 0.3 currently. Shareholders' equity was $147.4 million as of Q1 end. A further look into the leverage ratio by considering total liabilities of $67.8 million, and not just interest-bearing debt of $14 million, we still get a debt-to-equity of 0.12. Both debt-to-equity calculations based on interest-bearing debt and total liabilities as numerators show that Bit Digital has enough balance sheet health. The weight of debt in the company's capital structure is almost negligible. However, with the current expansion and the ongoing cash burn I highlighted in the preceding section of this article, it is no surprise that Bit Digital currently relies on a mix of equity-driven funding options. Hence, the 75 million shares offering priced at $2 for gross proceeds of $150 million was announced last week. There is also an active $500 million ATM , of which $48 million was raised post-Q1 (the $48 million ATM raise was disclosed in the Q1 earnings call ). Bit Digital has said the $150 million equity offering priced at $2 per share will be mostly used for the purchase of Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) as a corporate treasury asset. Previously in this piece, I mentioned ETH staking as an interesting stream of revenue because of its low cost of revenue and high gross margin compared to the other revenue streams. Doubling down on purchasing more ETH for treasury assets with the planned $150 million raise is a bold bet and gives potential yield generation from staking, but investors should be aware that this also creates a concentration risk with ETH, and BTBT will potentially be more closely tied to ETH price volatility. If the allocation to ETH ends up accounting for a higher share of revenue contribution, a good quarter in other operating segments could be distorted by a poor price performance from ETH. Data by YCharts Bit Digital isn't the most expensive digital asset miner at the moment, trading at 2x P/Sales and around 1.0 to book value. Among mining peers compared in the preceding chart, BTBT trades at the lowest multiple to sales and book value. The clear pivot to HPC has been followed by clear steps like the formal structuring of the business into WhiteFiber and the 1 million square foot site acquisition, which shows an impressive level of strategic commitment and capital deployment, and are the attractions here, in my view. Yes, there are ongoing dilution risks moving forward, but for a good portion of this capital cycle, the equity financings aren’t emergency raises yet. They are to fund the clear ETH treasury strategy and build out WhiteFiber into a full-scale HPC infrastructure asset. Bit Digital’s WhiteFiber carve-out got more interesting when an 8-K filing earlier this month hinted at the potential for WhiteFiber to become an independent public company through an IPO, and that process is well underway as Bit Digital submitted a confidential S-1 that included a draft registration statement with the SEC last week. There are potential outcomes that could play out that will potentially benefit existing BTBT shareholders if the IPO happens. First, BTBT shareholders could receive pro-rata shares in WhiteFiber post-IPO, giving them direct exposure to a potential fresh high-growth valuation. Then, even if WhiteFiber shares aren't distributed to BTBT shareholders but Bit Digital retains majority ownership of WhiteFiber, the separate listing would support a sum-of-the-parts re-rating for BTBT. Either path would allow BTBT investors to see the value of WhiteFiber more clearly reflected in BTBT’s market valuation. And I believe Bit Digital’s management will not want to put existing shareholders underwater with their decisions. The insider share accumulation has also increased lately at Bit Digital. The CEO has raised his holdings to over 2.1 million shares after purchasing 750,000 shares of the company's stock at $2.00 per share, disclosed in a Form 4 filing last week . This, I believe, strengthens alignment between management’s interests and those of shareholders. At 2x P/S and ~$2 per share, down 31% YTD, I believe BTBT is worth a Buy. The company’s pivot to both HPC and ETH treasury is transformational. Investors should not forget the potential for ongoing dilution and the growing concentration risk from ETH exposure. But at these levels, the risk/reward looks increasingly attractive. Trading at a modest 2x P/S with solid execution while undergoing a transforming business model, the market may still be pricing in the older, miner-only version of Bit Digital. This leaves room for a potential re-rating.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4798301-bit-digital-bitcoin-exit-real?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BUSINESS|ETH|MINING|BTC|REGULATION","BTC-USD|ETH-USD|BTBT",cryptocompare
2025-06-30T14:30:09,"Solana Forms Bullish Flag On Daily Chart — Breakout Imminent?","Solana is displaying signs of strength as it trades with a key chart pattern, which indicates that the altcoin is preparing for a solid move. The price has been holding steady, forming lower highs and higher lows within a narrowing range. This pause in momentum could be setting the stage for another breakout. Key Resistance Levels In Focus As Breakout Approaches Solana has developed a bullish flag pattern on the daily chart, signaling a continuation of its uptrend. According to Dynamite Trader’s post on X, this pattern often precedes strong breakouts, suggesting that momentum could soon accelerate. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Breakout Watch: Price Could Rally Hard Above $150 Level? Currently, SOL’s price is holding above the midline of the flag, indicating underlying strength. However, it’s also testing the daily 100 moving average (MA100), which is acting as a dynamic resistance. SOL’s reaction to this level will be crucial in determining whether the bullish flag leads to a decisive breakout or a deeper consolidation. Another analyst, Henry, highlighted that Solana is gearing up for a big move after completing a clean Cup and Handle breakout on the 4-hour chart, a bullish pattern that signals continuation. The breakout saw SOL flip the $149 resistance into support, a key technical shift. If this level holds, Henry sees a rally toward the $168 to $174 zone, which aligns with previous resistance levels and bullish extension targets. He adds a warning that volatility is increasing, and high-leverage positions are at risk on both sides. Solana is setting up a clean wedge on the weekly chart. Currently trading at $150, SOL has been consistently bouncing between support and resistance levels, which is known for building pressure before delivering sharp moves. Talking about this, Top G emphasizes that if this plays out as expected, the next leg up could be significant, and $300 isn’t just speculation; it’s a realistic target based on the structure and behavior. Holding Above The Breakout Zone Could Accelerate The Move Upward Solana has broken above the downtrend line on the 4-hour chart. This move could mark a pivotal shift in short-term momentum, with potential bullish continuation if current levels hold. Related Reading: Solana Price At ‘A Very Delicate Level’ – Analyst Says $148 Reclaim Is Key If SOL maintains its position above this trend line, crypto analyst Bens BTC noted that the price could climb toward the next resistance area at $165. The price action is forming a bullish structure, and momentum indicators may soon align with the breakout, further supporting the continuation of the upside. The asset had broken out with strong momentum and is now trading firmly within a long-term bullish channel, a structure that has supported uptrends. The price action looks clean, with higher highs and higher lows forming as SOL surges upward. Furthermore, analyst Persis10t revealed that momentum is picking up, and as long as the channel remains intact, the path forward could be explosive. If the structure holds and attracts volume, Persis10t projects a target of $700+ in the next run, pointing to the upper boundary of the bullish channel as a magnet for price.

However, if the Manta price successfully breaks above $0.201, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.226. MANTA Chart on TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, Manta’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.155, resulting in a correction to $0.139. Is MANTA a good investment? Manta’s rapid rise in DeFi TVL charts and alignment with Ethereum ‘s scaling roadmap via technologies like Manta Pacific suggest $MANTA’s potential. Grants support its ecosystem growth, and it leads in ZK technology adoption, promising for blockchain ‘s future. However, regulatory concerns over transaction privacy could affect its long-term viability, potentially impacting ZK protocols like $MANTA. Overall, Manta is a good investment if you want a profitable return in the long term. Why is the Manta price up today? Manta price has triggered a strong bullish rally toward $0.187. This occurred after buyers gained confidence and accumulated heavily around $0.16. Will Manta price recover? If bulls hold the price above $0.2, we might see further recovery toward immediate resistance channels. Will Manta price reach $10? In recent months, the Manta network expanded its offerings and established multiple partnerships. If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $10 mark. Will Manta reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment, the MNT price might take several years to reach the $100 milestone. We expect the Manta price to achieve $100 by 2060. Will Manta reach $1000? $1000 is a distant dream for Manta price. However, if everything remains in favor of the altcoin market, we might even see the MNT price hitting $1K. Is Manta a good long-term investment? Investors are bullish on Manta, which has gained significant attention in recent months. If developers continue to build robust utilities for Manta and the roadmap fulfills user demand, it can be a good long-term investment option.

This fresh transaction comes as Bhutan’s total bitcoin holdings have grown to 11,924 BTC, valued at approximately $1.28 billion at current market prices of around $107,000. The small Himalayan kingdom has become a significant player in the crypto space, with its bitcoin stash representing a sizable chunk of its economy. The holdings were built largely through state-backed mining operations under Druk Holdings, working alongside Bitdeer Technologies , which is expanding local mining capacity to 600 megawatts by 2025. The latest Binance deposit has fueled speculation about potential selling pressure, although no one from the government has not commented publicly on the reason for the transfer.

2025-06-30T14:14:24,"Best Crypto to Buy Now as Coinbase Named Among TIME’s 100 Most Influential Companies","Crypto adoption has steadily been accelerating across the globe, but in recent months, the narrative as a whole has gained traction. Demand is no longer speculative. The most telling sign yet came this week, when Coinbase earned a spot on TIME Magazine’s list of the 100 Most Influential Companies in the world. For a platform that once symbolized crypto’s outsider status, this marks a sharp evolution. While Coinbase’s size and presence may have made this inclusion inevitable, what truly matters is that it is among the first blockchain firms to receive such mainstream validation. This moment is not just about one company. It is a signal that crypto itself is being recognized as a serious, consequential asset class. And that makes this a critical time to invest. Why This Recognition Is Big For Crypto Crypto’s journey from misunderstood internet money to mainstream relevance has been anything but subtle, but recent months have accelerated the transition faster than anyone expected. Demand has been rising globally, with adoption no longer confined to developers and traders. Financial institutions are adapting. Governments are debating frameworks instead of issuing warnings. And now, TIME Magazine has officially recognized Coinbase as one of the 100 Most Influential Companies in the world. This may sound like a logical acknowledgment for a company of Coinbase’s scale, but it is actually historic. It is the first time a crypto-native platform has entered TIME’s elite club, marking a wider shift in perception: crypto is not just here to stay, it is becoming foundational. JUST IN:🇺🇸 COINBASE HAS BEEN NAMED ON TIME MAGAZINE'S 100 MOST INFLUENTIAL COMPANIES LIST FOR 2025! pic.twitter.com/L1iejYyAI3 — Coinvo (@ByCoinvo) June 28, 2025 The platform has taken a front-row seat in shaping U.S. crypto policy, becoming a visible actor in regulatory conversations in Washington. Its rise in stock price, buoyed by legislation like the GENIUS stablecoin bill, only added to the perception that this company, and by extension, the crypto industry, now has staying power. With a fresh MiCA license in Europe and the establishment of its EU headquarters in Luxembourg, Coinbase has positioned itself as a truly global platform. And it is not just staying within crypto. It is now moving toward tokenized equities and multi-asset offerings, which could turn it into a full-fledged brokerage for the digital age. When the gatekeepers start validating blockchain companies at this level, it signals that the crypto market is not only maturing but also asserting long-term relevance. This is the moment where future blue-chip crypto projects begin to separate from the noise. For investors paying attention, this might be one of the most opportune times to enter. As crypto moves further into the financial mainstream, the next generation of transformative tokens could already be taking shape. Best Crypto to Buy Now - Tokens That Could Be Listed on Coinbase Solaxy Solaxy is not a project that appeared out of nowhere. It has been gradually building momentum through a clear and well-executed plan, and now that the token is live, the market is beginning to respond. The main value of Solaxy lies in its dual-chain infrastructure. By allowing movement across both Ethereum and Solana, it eliminates the kind of compromise developers usually face when trying to build scalable applications with cross-chain access. Solaxy treats that limitation as unnecessary, and so far, the response has been strong. Its early listings on several decentralized exchanges have already pushed it into wider visibility. Unlike many tokens that struggle post-launch, SOLX has maintained strong activity levels. That consistency is helped by a growing number of smaller projects beginning to interact with Solaxy’s framework, particularly in areas like NFT mints and mid-size DeFi tools. With a market cap of around $72 million, it is currently gearing up for a string of listings across both centralized and decentralized platforms. If this demand holds and usage continues rising, the project may start appearing on larger exchange radars. There is already some discussion among market watchers about its positioning. At a time when the crypto market is being taken more seriously by regulators and institutions, platforms like Solaxy, ones that actually offer usable infrastructure, have a chance to become much more than just trading instruments. They could become the foundations upon which the next set of projects are built. SUBBD SUBBD functions differently from most of what the market has seen this year. It is not built around speculative loops or copy-paste tokenomics. It has been structured with a clear end user in mind: digital creators who want more control over their content, audience, and revenue. The entire system puts ownership first, which is why it is starting to attract attention in places far beyond just crypto circles. Where traditional platforms run on visibility algorithms, SUBBD pushes everything through a direct value mechanism. Whether it is exclusive content, fan engagement, or long-term membership perks, each part of the platform gives creators the tools to set their own terms. There is no need to rely on sponsorship deals or third-party monetization methods. That approach has helped the project stand out in a space where short-term hype often takes priority over actual design. The presale is ongoing, and interest continues to grow. What is notable is how strong the retention has been as users do not just visit and leave. They stay, explore, and contribute to the platform’s growing ecosystem. That kind of response matters more than numbers on a dashboard. The project has been dubbed a top potential initiative by several creators as well, including popular crypto education channel 99Bitcoins . As SUBBD grows, there is a possibility that it enters conversations around wider adoption. With a distinct use case and real-world relevance, it fits the kind of model that larger platforms sometimes look for. Best Wallet Token There has been no shortage of wallets launched over the past few years, but very few manage to hold attention for long. Best Wallet Token exists to tie an already functioning ecosystem together that is focused on clarity, practicality, and everyday usability. The wallet it powers is straightforward in the best way possible: multi-chain, swap-ready, and designed to work without friction. The token adds real function to that system. It is not just a reward tool. It provides access to discounted features, upgrades, and deeper participation across future expansions. Users are not just holding a coin; they are holding a pass that improves how they interact with the wallet. That kind of direct link between product and token is rare, and it is one of the reasons Best Wallet Token is starting to draw attention. What is also worth noting is how the wallet itself is positioned. It is being marketed as a foundational tool rather than a novelty, and that shows in its interface, documentation, and roadmap. With more people entering crypto through mobile-first and browser-based wallets, this project enters at the right time and with the right priorities. It is still early, but based on current demand, there is a clear possibility it attracts interest beyond just the presale community. As onboarding becomes the next big focus for mainstream platforms, projects that simplify access without compromising on features will likely be the ones that last, and this token is built exactly for that role. Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper is built on a simple premise: Bitcoin is strong, but it is not yet complete. Despite its unmatched security and value retention, Bitcoin still lacks the transactional flexibility that newer chains offer. That is the gap Bitcoin Hyper aims to close. As a Layer 2 protocol developed specifically for the Bitcoin network, it introduces a faster, lighter framework that enables cheaper transfers, smart contract capabilities, and more dynamic applications without compromising Bitcoin’s underlying integrity. Unlike Ethereum-based Layer 2s, Bitcoin Hyper is not built to compete with its base layer. It is built to complement it. By using advanced rollup mechanics and sidechain infrastructure, the protocol allows users to engage in everything from DeFi to NFT minting without ever leaving the Bitcoin ecosystem. This extension of utility could reshape how developers and users interact with Bitcoin, not just as a store of value, but as an active network. With over $1.6 million raised at the time of writing, the project’s set launch time is ideal as well. With major players like Coinbase gaining institutional recognition and expanding into broader crypto services, there is increasing interest in infrastructure-layer projects tied to Bitcoin. If Bitcoin Hyper continues building steadily and gains adoption from developers looking to operate within a Bitcoin-native environment, it could very well become one of the few Layer 2s that captures serious attention post-launch. Conclusion The inclusion of Coinbase in TIME’s 100 Most Influential Companies is not just a win for one exchange. It is a clear sign that the crypto industry is starting to cross the threshold from speculation to recognition. In times like these, the real opportunities tend to lie with projects that are not only building but building with purpose. Whether through infrastructure, utility, or long-term design, some of the most promising names in the space are already beginning to align with this changing narrative; some examples already featured above. These are the types of initiatives worth paying attention to, especially now, when the next phase of adoption may already be underway.

2025-06-30T14:10:20,"Strategy joins Russell Top 200 Value Index with $64b BTC on the books","With its latest purchase, Strategy now holds a staggering $64 billion worth of BTC, making it by far the world’s most aggressive corporate holder. But the real story isn’t just the size of its hoard, it’s the Russell Top 200 Value Index inclusion, marking perhaps the clearest sign yet that Wall Street views Bitcoin as a legitimate value asset. On June 30, Strategy announced the acquisition of 4,980 new Bitcoin ( BTC ) for approximately $531.9 million, paying an average of $106,801 per BTC. The purchase, executed as Bitcoin traded near all-time highs, brings the company’s total holdings to 597,325 BTC. Strategy’s Bitcoin treasury is worth roughly $42.4 billion at an average cost basis of $70,982 per coin, or $64.2 billion at the current price of $107,732 per BTC, according to crypto.news data. The move extends Strategy’s unbroken streak of aggressive Bitcoin acquisitions since August 2020, reinforcing its thesis that BTC serves as a superior treasury reserve asset. Year-to-date, the company’s Bitcoin holdings have generated a 19.7% yield, outpacing traditional equity benchmarks. Strategy has acquired 4,980 BTC for ~$531.9 million at ~$106,801 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 19.7% YTD 2025. As of 6/29/2025, we hodl 597,325 $BTC acquired for ~$42.40 billion at ~$70,982 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRK $STRF $STRD https://t.co/xvWnSkfukS — Michael Saylor (@saylor) June 30, 2025 The acquisition coincided with Strategy’s inclusion in the Russell Top 200 Value Index, a benchmark typically dominated by financials, energy giants, and consumer staples. Read more: Kazakhstan announces plans to establish a state crypto reserve Decoding Strategy’s Russell Top 200 Value Index inclusion According to index provider FTSE Russell, Strategy has been added to the Russell Top 200 Value Index, an exclusive club of large-cap U.S. companies traditionally defined by stable earnings, low price-to-book ratios, and reliable dividends. The inclusion is a watershed moment for Bitcoin’s maturation as an institutional asset, placing a company holding 597,325 BTC alongside blue-chip value stocks like Berkshire Hathaway, JPMorgan Chase, and ExxonMobil. The juxtaposition is jarring but telling. While these companies generate cash flows from tangible assets or services, Strategy’s value proposition hinges on a digital asset with no earnings, suggesting that in an era of fiscal uncertainty, Bitcoin’s programmatic scarcity is being priced like a hard asset. The index’s methodology, which prioritizes low P/E ratios and book value, makes Strategy’s inclusion even more striking. The company’s 19.7% BTC yield in 2025 likely offset concerns about its lack of conventional value metrics, signaling that scarcity itself is becoming a measurable financial primitive. The inclusion is also a litmus test for how Wall Street now views crypto-native treasury models. For years, critics dismissed corporate BTC treasuries as gimmicks. Now, with a 19.7% YTD yield and a seat at the value investing table, the argument is shifting.

2025-06-30T14:06:08,"CryptoQuant Analyst Reveals Latest Data! ""Investors Are Selling This Altcoin, Buying Bitcoin (BTC)!""","The Bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets, which are affected by political and geopolitical events, have been moving sideways in recent days. While investors are eagerly waiting for a major rally to begin, especially for altcoins, CryptoQuant analyst said that investors are selling Ethereum (ETH) and buying Bitcoin (BTC). Investors Are Selling Ethereum and Buying Bitcoin! In his latest blog post discussing the behavior of retail investors, CyptoQuant analyst Amr Taha explained that the latest data shows that retail investors are actively buying Bitcoin, while the selling pressure on Ethereum continues. CryptoQuant analyst noted that Ethereum inflows to Binance have been continuing for five days, indicating that this is a signal of temporary selling pressure for ETH. In response to the selling pressure in ETH, active purchases are seen by retail investors in the Bitcoin market. Although purchases in BTC have increased, the analyst argued that these purchases are made by short-term investors, which could indicate a potential peak for BTC. “The realized market value of short-term Bitcoin investors (STH) has increased from -$4.9 billion to over $5 billion. This change generally reflects aggressive Bitcoin accumulation by retail traders. Historically, aggressive buying by short-term investors is most prevalent near market tops, as retail investors tend to get caught up in FOMO during Bitcoin rallies, making them more likely to buy near potential market tops.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-30T14:05:43,"Bitcoin (BTC) Hits Bull Flag Peak: Will a Dip Precede an Explosive Breakout?","Following very positive price action last week, the Bitcoin (BTC) price has hit the top of its bull flag. A rejection is quite likely to take place from here. That said, this could be the last down movement within the flag as Bitcoin may be readying for an explosive breakout. Bitcoin treasuries and U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs fervently purchasing Bitcoin treasuries are continuing to buy, with Michael Saylor’s Strategy having just announced a 4,980 BTC purchase, bringing its total holdings to nearly 600,000 BTC, at a cost basis of nearly $71,000 per Bitcoin. Last week, the U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted a total inflow of just over 21,000 BTC, with the Blackrock IBIT ETF accounting for more than half of this. The Japanese Bitcoin treasury company Metaplanet was the first to announce a purchase of Bitcoin on Monday as it acquired an additional 1,005 BTC, making it the 5th-largest public Bitcoin holder, putting it above Galaxy Digital and Cleanspark. It’s into this rapid purchasing fervour that the Bitcoin price finds itself at the top of a bull flag and potentially not far from exploding skyward from the upper trendline. $BTC rejection from top of bull flag Source: TradingView The short-term chart for $BTC shows how the price just touched the top of the bull flag. A rejection is taking place, and it just remains to be seen how deep this might go. The price is currently propped up by support at $107,600, but as the shorter term Stochastic RSIs come back down and reset the price could fall further, perhaps down to the major support at $106,000, or possibly even down as far as $104,000. Given that the 4-hour Stochastic RSI has already touched bottom, the $106,000 horizontal support could be more likely to be the extent of the dip. Daily time frame shows potential dip incoming Source: TradingView The daily time frame reveals the magnitude of the bull flag. It can be seen that a rejection may have begun, but that a breakout to the upside still looks far more likely than one to the downside. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI on this time frame has its indicators at the top, presaging a loss of price momentum. However, when these indicators cross down, they could be held up by the 80.00 level, or perhaps the 50.00 level, before crossing back up again. The Relative Strength Index, right at the bottom of the chart, is showing that the indicator is angled downward. That said, if the indicator does come down and confirm the descending trendline before rising again, this would be a bullish event. 2-week time frame reveals price action on a knife edge Source: TradingView The 2-week chart for $BTC illustrates how things are currently on a knife edge. The price action in the main window of the chart shows how this next weekly close, which coincides with the 2-week close, really needs to be above the major $104,400 horizontal support. This would go a long way towards marking this level as a base for the next surge higher. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI indicators are in a very tight embrace. If the blue (fast) indicator line can be above the red (slow) line at the end of this week it will be bullish. Also, the MACD at the very bottom of the chart is showing its indicator lines entwined, while the histogram bars are continuing to be flat. Look for this indicator to signal one way or the other by the end of this week. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-06-30T14:00:24,"This Bitcoin Bull Market Cycle Breaks The Mold With Unusually Waning Network Activity","Bitcoin’s strong positioning above the $107,000 mark has sparked hopes of a continued bull market cycle, with the potential to reach a new all-time high before it comes to an end. Despite this remarkable performance, the current bull cycle still feels different when compared to past cycles in terms of network activity. Unlike Past Bull Cycles, Bitcoin Network Activity Falters After reclaiming beyond the $100,000 landmark, Bitcoin’s bull cycle looks like it is still on. However, the current Bitcoin bull cycle is deviating from historical norms because of an unanticipated dip in on-chain activity rather than price action. Darkfost, a verified author on CryptoQuant and market expert, has underlined the disparity between this cycle and past cycles in a research shared on the X platform. “We’ve often heard that this cycle feels different, and when it comes to Bitcoin network activity, it truly is,” the expert stated. Unlike earlier bull cycles that were accompanied by a high number of transactions , skyrocketing address growth, and soaring network fees, this cycle is taking place on a rather quiet blockchain action. According to the on-chain expert, this is the first bull market cycle of Bitcoin where there is no increase in on-chain activity, reflecting a shift in the historical trend. The expert has delved into BTC’s active address count , revealing a persistent drop. Data shows that the number of BTC active addresses has been steadily declining since its peak in 2021 during the bull cycle. Despite BTC’s notable upward performance this cycle, fewer wallets appear to be interacting with the network, which is an indication of fading on-chain participation. In 2021, BTC’s active addresses reached a high of 1.5 million, but the figure has since fallen to 740,000 addresses. This steady decline in active addresses raises concerns about the sustainability of the current rally. Spot BTC ETFs Influencing Investment In The Asset Historically, activity on the Bitcoin network tends to resume its growth after a bear market phase. However, this has not been the case for the leading blockchain since 2023. During the inception of the Bitcoin Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) , a sharp drop in network activity was also observed. Addressing the 2024 decline, Darkfost stated that many investors may be opting to obtain exposure through ETFs rather than directly holding BTC. By doing so, these investors might steer clear of the security dangers associated with self-custody and the complexity of managing transactions. Considering this shift, it could be said that the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs may have had a significant impact on how investors invest in BTC, with obvious ramifications for on-chain measures . As the number of active addresses continues to decrease, speculations are whether the ongoing rally is relying more on speculative flows or institutional demand rather than broad user participation.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-waning-network-activity/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin active addresses|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Spot Exchange-Traded Funds|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|CryptoQuant|Darkfost|ETFs",cryptocompare

Investors are worried about the US getting involved in the conflict after President Trump warned Iran about not signing a deal. The flagship cryptocurrency plunged from an intraday high of $106,513 on Friday as markets turned bearish. It fell to a low of $102,446 before settling at $103,388, ultimately registering a drop of 1.19%. BTC is down nearly 2% over the past 24 hours, trading around $103,495. Semler Scientific Discloses Ambitious Bitcoin Strategy Healthcare technology firm Semler Scientific has announced an ambitious Bitcoin accumulation plan to expand its Bitcoin holdings aggressively. The company also announced the appointment of Joe Burnett as the Director of Bitcoin Strategy. Semler Scientific plans to increase its Bitcoin holdings to 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025, 42,000 BTC by the end of 2026, and 105,000 by the end of 2027. It plans to use proceeds from equity and debt financing and cash flows from operations to fund the purchases. “Semler Scientific also announced that it plans to hold 10,000 bitcoins by year-end 2025, 42,000 by year-end 2026, and 105,000 by year-end 2027, using proceeds from equity and debt financings and cash flows from operations.” Burnett stated that Semler Scientific is committed to expanding its Bitcoin reserves in a way that could benefit shareholders who believe Bitcoin is the ultimate long-term asset. Semler Scientific was optimistic about Burnett’s appointment as its Director of Bitcoin Strategy, stating, “We are excited to have Joe join our Bitcoin strategy team and help drive our three-year plan to own 105,000 bitcoins. Joe is an analytical thought leader on Bitcoin and Bitcoin treasury companies. His expertise will be instrumental as we pursue our bitcoin treasury strategy and aim to deliver long-term value to our stockholders.” Worries About A Post-Trump Bitcoin Eric Semler, the chairman of healthcare firm Semler Scientific Inc., has revealed that many hedge fund executives are skeptical and worried about Bitcoin’s prospects once President Trump leaves office. Semler stated in an interview with Natalie Brunell, “I think that they think it is a fly-by-night concept and that it is probably going to, after the Trump administration, go back down a lot.” Semler, also the founder of TCS Capital Management, made the comments amid growing skepticism within the crypto industry about how long the support for crypto will last once President Trump exits office. Some prominent figures, like Jan3 founder Samson Mow, are concerned that support for crypto could vanish under a future president. However, Semler has doubled down on Bitcoin , with Semler Scientific becoming the second publicly traded company in the US to adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy. The company has announced an aggressive Bitcoin acquisition plan to take its holdings to 105,000 BTC . “When you’re making a bet on something that the majority doesn’t believe in, and you’re right, you make so much more money. I think we got great opportunities to show people that basically they’re missing out on a great opportunity.” Hedge Funds Turning To Bitcoin A survey by the Alternative Investment Management Association and PwC in October 2024 revealed that 47% of hedge fund managers are exposed to crypto. This is up from 29% in 2023. Meanwhile, 37% of the respondents said they had no exposure to crypto in 2022. In 2021, Intertrust surveyed chief financial officers from 100 hedge funds about plans to purchase crypto assets, including Bitcoin. 98% of them responded that they expect hedge funds to invest at least 7% of their assets in crypto by 2026. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) registered an alarming slump on Friday as market sentiment worsened thanks to escalating geopolitical tensions. As a result, the flagship cryptocurrency dropped from an intraday high of $106,513 to $102,446 before reclaiming $103,000 and settling at $103,388. Markets have been under tremendous pressure thanks to macroeconomic factors and geopolitical uncertainty. This led to the crypto market falling nearly 1.50% on June 21, wiping out $240 billion in value. One of the biggest triggers for BTC and the crypto market’s decline is the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. Investors and market watchers are worried about the US getting involved in the conflict after President Trump adopted a hardline stance and issued a veiled threat to Iran’s supreme leader. Trump has also warned Iran over not signing a deal when it had the opportunity. Bitcoin whales are also selling their holdings as they lock their profits, putting more pressure on the price. According to data from Glassnode, wallets that held BTC for 6-12 months sold over $900 million of the asset in recent weeks as they began cashing out. Long-term Bitcoin holders took home $1.2 billion in profits in early June. Liquidations have also put pressure on the price, as many traders using leverage were wiped out thanks to BTC’s recent price action. Over the past 24 hours, over $500 million in crypto positions were liquidated, affecting over 134,000 traders. BTC started the previous week in positive territory, surging over 4% to cross the 20-day SMA and $110,000 to settle at $110,247. The price fell to an intraday low of $108,325 on Tuesday before recovering to reclaim $110,000 and settle at $110,258. BTC lost momentum on Wednesday, falling 1.43% to $108,686. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as the price plunged nearly 3%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,826. BTC fell to an intraday low of $102,854 on Friday as selling pressure persisted. However, it recovered from this level to register a marginal increase, reclaim $106,000, and settle at $106,106. Source: TradingView Sellers regained control on Saturday as BTC fell 0.59% to $105,482 before registering a marginal increase on Sunday and settling at $105,561. BTC started the week on a bullish note, surging to an intraday high of $108,939 before settling at $106,808, ultimately registering an increase of $106,808. Price action turned negative on Tuesday as BTC fell over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and $105,000 to $104,519. The flagship cryptocurrency faced volatility on Wednesday but registered a marginal increase and moved to $104,884. It was back in the red on Thursday, dropping 0.24% to $104,631. BTC raced to an intraday high of $106,513 but lost momentum after reaching this level, eventually falling below the 20-day SMA and settling at $103,388. The current session sees the price marginally up, trading around $103,781. Buyers will look to maintain control and push BTC beyond $105,000.

2025-06-30T13:59:22,"Popular Financial Advisor Ric Edelman Says Investors Should Allocate Up to 40% of Wealth to Crypto","Prominent financial advisor Ric Edelman says investors should consider putting as much as 40% of their wealth into cryptocurrency, a bold recommendation that reflects how far digital assets have come in recent years. “Today I am saying 40%, that’s astonishing,” Edelman told CNBC’s Crypto World on Friday. “No one has ever said such a thing.” Edelman, founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, has been active in crypto for over a decade. He first urged investors to allocate part of their portfolios to bitcoin BTC in 2018. In his 2021 book “The Truth About Crypto,” he described even a 1% crypto allocation as “reasonable” for most people. Now, Edelman believes the case for crypto exposure is far stronger, pointing to what he called a “massive change” in the industry over the past four years. In particular, he highlighted growing political support for digital assets, especially following the election of U.S. President Donald Trump. “Today, all those questions have been resolved,” Edelman said, referring to regulatory uncertainty and institutional hesitation. “It’s radically changed and is now a mainstream asset.” Edelman’s firm, Edelman Financial Engines, manages nearly $300 billion in assets. Though traditionally known for retirement planning and wealth management, the firm’s growing attention to digital assets mirrors a broader trend among financial institutions embracing crypto as a legitimate asset class. Even though Edelman described crypto as the “best investment opportunity of the decade,” he acknowledged that a 40% allocation may not suit everyone, suggesting a more conservative 10% for those with lower risk tolerance. Edelman’s recommendation marks one of the most aggressive calls from a mainstream financial figure to date. Most financial advisors in the U.S. are currently recommending well under 5% to their clients.

2025-06-30T13:55:52,"How Much You Should Invest in Bitcoin (BTC)? Veteran Trader Peter Brandt Weighs in","TL;DR The expert advises monthly investments in SPY and BTC for long-term success. The leading cryptocurrency is up 6% this week and trades near $108,000. Analysts are split – some see a breakout to $130K – $200K if key resistance levels are cleared, while others warn of a possible drop to $100K or even $95K if momentum fades. ‘Trading is the Wrong Path’ Besides its fundamentals and ability to transform the global financial system, Bitcoin (BTC) has proven to be an excellent investment opportunity. At least, that was the case in the past few years: the asset went through multiple bear and bull markets to eventually cross the $100,000 mark. Currently, it trades at around $108,000 (according to CoinGecko’s data), representing a 75% increase on a yearly scale and a substantial 43,000% jump compared to its valuation a decade ago. But does the leading cryptocurrency remain a good investment after this major rally over the years, and how much should people allocate to it? That’s a question many people are trying to figure out. It seems that there isn’t a direct answer, and it all depends on the risk profile of the investors, as well as other important factors. However, one can turn to certain experts who are experienced enough to give guidance. An example is the veteran trader Peter Brandt, who recently suggested that approximately 95% of people fail when trading. Instead, he advised them to excel in their regular jobs, prioritize their families, and invest in homeownership. Last but not least, Brandt recommended making monthly investments, allocating 80% of the amount to SPY (the ETF that tracks the S&P 500 Index) and 20% to BTC.

The asset has increased in value by approximately 6% over the past week, with numerous analysts predicting a surge to a new all-time high if certain conditions are met . The X user Cipher X believes “a strong weekly close” above $107,720 could open the door to a further rally to as high as $130,000-$135,000 in Q3 2025. “Just look at Q4 2024 chart and you’ll see what happened when BTC had its biggest weekly close,” they added. Merlijn The Trader thinks the final pump for this bull run is coming, envisioning a fresh ATH of around $200,000 towards the end of the year. At the same time, he advised investors to take profits, anticipating a drastic pullback to $95,000 shortly after that. On the contrary, Ali Martinez argued that the cryptocurrency currently faces a key rejection while the stochastic RSI flashes a death cross on the daily chart. The analyst thinks a plunge to $100,000 is not out of the question unless “we get a sustained close” above $109,000. The post How Much You Should Invest in Bitcoin (BTC)?

2025-06-30T13:50:28,"Crypto Scam Ring Busted: Spain Unveils Massive $540M Fraud Network","BitcoinWorld Crypto Scam Ring Busted: Spain Unveils Massive $540M Fraud Network The digital world, for all its promises of innovation and financial freedom, often hides a darker side. For thousands of unsuspecting victims, that dark side just manifested in a devastating way. In a significant win for global law enforcement, Spanish authorities have recently dismantled a massive crypto scam ring, responsible for siphoning nearly $540 million from over 5,000 individuals worldwide. This isn’t just another headline; it’s a stark reminder of the ever-present dangers lurking in the unregulated corners of the cryptocurrency market. The Alarming Reality: Unpacking a Massive Crypto Scam Imagine losing your life savings, or a significant portion of your hard-earned money, to a sophisticated fraud scheme. For more than 5,000 people across the globe, this nightmare became a reality. Spanish police, leading an intricate international investigation with crucial support from Europol, recently announced the arrest of five individuals linked to a colossal crypto scam operation. This syndicate allegedly laundered a staggering $540 million, exploiting the allure of quick riches in the crypto space. The scale of this operation is truly breathtaking, highlighting the global reach and financial impact that these criminal enterprises can achieve. The victims, spanning multiple continents, were lured into what they believed were legitimate, high-yield crypto investment opportunities. Little did they know, they were falling prey to a meticulously orchestrated scheme designed solely to defraud them. Behind the Curtains: How the Crypto Investment Scam Operated So, how exactly do these sophisticated operations manage to deceive so many? The methods employed by this particular crypto investment scam were typical of many modern financial frauds, but with a distinct cryptocurrency twist. The criminals leveraged the pseudonymous nature of digital assets and the rapid pace of transactions to their advantage. Here’s a breakdown of their likely modus operandi: Deceptive Platforms: Victims were often directed to professional-looking websites or applications that mimicked legitimate investment platforms. These sites would display fabricated returns and ‘successful’ trades, creating a false sense of security and profitability. Social Engineering: The scammers likely employed social engineering tactics, building trust with victims through various channels, including social media, dating apps, or even direct calls. They would pose as experienced financial advisors or successful traders, offering exclusive investment opportunities. Fake Accounts and Wallets: A key component of the laundering process involved the use of numerous fake accounts and crypto wallets. These were crucial for moving the illicit funds quickly across borders, making them incredibly difficult for law enforcement to trace. The funds would be fragmented and shuffled through multiple layers of transactions to obscure their origin. Pressure Tactics: Once a victim showed interest, they would be pressured into investing larger sums, often with promises of even higher returns. Any attempts to withdraw funds would be met with excuses, demands for additional fees, or simply ignored. The rapid evolution of technology, including the increasing sophistication of AI-powered deepfakes and convincing phishing campaigns, further fuels these types of schemes, making it harder for the average person to discern genuine opportunities from elaborate hoaxes. A Global Alliance: Spain’s Leadership in the Europol Investigation The success in dismantling this network underscores the critical importance of international cooperation in combating cybercrime. This particular investigation, while led by Spain, was a truly collaborative effort, benefiting significantly from the support and resources of Europol. Europol, the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation, plays a pivotal role in coordinating cross-border investigations, sharing intelligence, and providing operational support to member states. The complexity of tracking illicit funds across various blockchain networks and multiple jurisdictions presents a formidable challenge for individual national police forces. This is where a unified approach, like that spearheaded by Europol, becomes indispensable. The involvement of Europol meant that law enforcement agencies from different countries could pool their expertise, resources, and intelligence to unravel the intricate web of this Spain crypto fraud . It’s a testament to the growing global commitment to making the crypto space safer and holding criminals accountable, regardless of where they operate from. The Double-Edged Sword: Digital Anonymity and the Rise of Fraud The very features that make cryptocurrencies appealing – decentralization, speed, and perceived digital anonymity – are often exploited by criminals. While true anonymity on public blockchains is a myth (transactions are public, though identities behind wallets are not), the ease of creating new wallets and the lack of traditional financial intermediaries make it a fertile ground for illicit activities. Criminals leverage this perceived anonymity to hide their tracks, move large sums of money quickly, and avoid traditional financial oversight. Furthermore, the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has added another layer of complexity. AI can be used to generate highly convincing phishing emails, create realistic deepfake videos for social engineering, and even automate parts of the scamming process, making these schemes more scalable and harder to detect. The combination of easy access to crypto, the promise of quick returns, and the sophisticated use of technology creates a potent environment for fraud. Authorities are constantly playing catch-up, developing new forensic tools and investigative techniques to pierce through the veil of digital anonymity that criminals seek to exploit. Protecting Your Digital Assets: Actionable Insights for Investors While law enforcement continues its vital work, individual vigilance remains your first line of defense against crypto scams. Here are some actionable insights to protect yourself and your digital assets: Do Your Due Diligence: Before investing in any crypto project or platform, conduct thorough research. Check reviews, look for legitimate whitepapers, and verify the team behind the project. If something seems too good to be true, it almost certainly is. Be Wary of Unsolicited Offers: Be highly skeptical of investment opportunities that come from unknown sources, especially via social media, email, or messaging apps. Legitimate investment firms rarely cold-call or message individuals with high-yield offers. Verify Identities: If you’re interacting with an individual claiming to be a financial advisor, verify their credentials and the company they claim to represent through official channels. Understand the Risks: Cryptocurrencies are volatile and speculative. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Be suspicious of guaranteed returns, as these are a major red flag for scams. Secure Your Wallets: Use strong, unique passwords, enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on all your crypto accounts and exchanges, and consider hardware wallets for significant holdings. Report Suspicious Activity: If you encounter a scam or suspicious activity, report it to the relevant authorities immediately. Your report can help prevent others from becoming victims. Conclusion: Vigilance in the Digital Frontier The bust of this $540 million crypto scam ring by Spanish police, with the critical assistance of Europol, is a significant victory in the ongoing battle against cybercrime. It sends a clear message that law enforcement agencies worldwide are enhancing their capabilities to track and apprehend those who exploit the crypto ecosystem for illicit gains. However, as long as the allure of quick wealth and the complexities of digital assets persist, fraudsters will continue to innovate their methods. The responsibility, therefore, falls on each one of us to remain educated, vigilant, and cautious. By understanding the tactics of these criminals and adopting robust security practices, we can collectively work towards a safer and more secure digital financial future. To learn more about the latest crypto market trends and security best practices, explore our article on key developments shaping Bitcoin and Ethereum price action.

2025-06-30T13:47:17,"This Trader Was Liquidated 8 Times in a Week, Losing Millions","A trader, known only by the handle “qwatio” on the social media platform X, has been under the spotlight for the on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain. Recent developments regarding the unfortunate losses include a partial liquidation of 8,000 ETH ($20.11M) and 280 BTC ($30.4M). High-Risk, High-Reward, High-Loss The journey that this trader went through on Hyperliquid has sparked debate about whether or not he might be an insider, as the analysis firm noted earlier this March. His long BTC & ETH positions, with 50x leverage, netted a profit of around $6.8M in a single day, right before Trump signed one of his executive orders. Their investigation reveals continued high-risk, 50x leveraged positions in ETH, which, after accounting for profits, resulted in over 160,000 ETH being liquidated — a burden that the liquidity provider, HLP, had to absorb. As a result, Hyperliquid has since capped the maximum leverage possible for ETH to x25 to avoid this from happening again. Seemingly unscathed, the risky bets continued, with the trader going short on Bitcoin. A dedicated “team” of people even tried to liquidate his positions, but the response to the margin call was quick. The user added $5M to support the trade, the prices fell further, resulting in a profit of $4.4M. Lookonchain summarized that this trader made over $10M in each of two separate wallets and another with over $9M in profits. After covering any prior losses, the winnings total $4.79M. But, as with everything, all good things come to an end. The traders’ new wallet did not fare well this time around, with six liquidations in the last few days, resulting in a total loss of approximately $10 million. A Familiar Feeling If the above story reminds you of someone, it’s not by coincidence. Known for even higher-stakes, higher-leverage plays, James Wynn is another trader who’s been under Lookonchain’s radar and whose journey we’ve also recapped . Perhaps the most notable endeavor was his $1.25 billion long BTC position with 40x leverage, which at one point resulted in over $87 million in unrealized profits, before the news that President Trump would be imposing tariffs on the European Union. His trading spree also ended in losses, but they were substantially exaggerated in that his unrealized PNL had reached almost nine figures before roundtripping it all. The analytics firm notes, “It took him 70 days to go from 0 to $87M+ in profit, and only 5 days to lose almost all the $87M+ in profit.” The post This Trader Was Liquidated 8 Times in a Week, Losing Millions appeared first on CryptoPotato .",cryptopotato,https://cryptopotato.com/this-trader-was-liquidated-8-times-in-a-week-losing-millions/,"ZRX|ETH|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET","AA News|Crypto News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|Ethereum (ETH) Price",cryptocompare
