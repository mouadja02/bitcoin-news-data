2025-06-30T05:30:59,"Top Analyst Predicts Major Ethereum Rally Toward $4,000 As Shorts Hit All-Time Highs","As the market‚Äôs second largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum (ETH), struggles to maintain momentum above the crucial $2,500 threshold, one analyst believes that ETH is poised for a significant rally. In a recent post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), crypto analyst Cyclop expressed a bullish outlook, labeling the current market conditions as the best long setup for Ethereum he has seen in years. Analyst Sees $4,000 Target This Summer Cyclop highlighted that Ethereum short positions have reached all-time highs, a situation reminiscent of a previous spike that occurred just weeks ago. The analyst noted that liquidity has been swept on both sides, creating a scenario where market uncertainty may actually benefit Ethereum. ‚ÄúMost doubt ETH and altcoins right now‚ÄîI‚Äôm betting on $4,000 this summer,‚Äù he stated confidently. Related Reading: TD Sequential Flashes Buy: Dogecoin Ready For Rebound To $0.21 Cyclop outlined several key factors driving his optimistic stance. First, he pointed to the recent Pectra update, which has reinvigorated interest in Ethereum by enhancing transaction capabilities, updating security features, and improving staking options. This update has reportedly led to increased demand, contributing to a potential price surge. Moreover, Cyclop emphasized the broader macroeconomic landscape, noting that cryptocurrency adoption is accelerating beyond Bitcoin (BTC), with Ethereum taking a prominent role. The analyst suggests that major corporations and banks are beginning to purchase and stake Ethereum, further boosting trust and interest in the digital asset which could ultimately result in more demand and more price uptrends. Ethereum Rallies May Trigger Altcoin Boom On-chain metrics also favor Ethereum, with the cryptocurrency ranking highly in various categories, according to Cyclop. It currently stands as the second-highest by fees, leads in bridged net flows, and ranks third in stablecoin supply changes, showcasing its robust market position. Another critical aspect of Cyclop‚Äôs analysis concerns altcoins and the upcoming altseason, traditionally characterized by a rush of investment into Ethereum before spilling over into smaller tokens. He pointed out that historical patterns indicate that Ethereum price rallies often trigger broader altcoin surges, and the current market sentiment suggests that many altcoins are at their lowest ebb. Related Reading: Dogecoin Silent Build-Up: Double Bottom Hints At Explosive Move To $0.47 While Cyclop acknowledges that a majority of altcoins may face significant challenges, he argues that ETH remains undervalued, especially with Bitcoin trading near $100,000. He has made strategic moves, reallocating some of his Bitcoin holdings into Ethereum and promising strong altcoins. His initial target for Ethereum is $3,000, where he plans to take profits, followed by a series of sell orders between $4,000 and $6,000. As of press time, ETH trades at $2,500, a 12% price increase in the weekly time frame.

2025-06-30T05:30:58,"3 Things That Could Impact Bitcoin and Crypto Markets in Week Ahead","US stock markets surged last week, with major indexes approaching all-time highs on the easing of tensions in the Middle East and rising hopes for a Federal Reserve rate cut later this year. Crypto markets were a little slower to react, remaining mostly flat over the past week and into the weekend. The Fed‚Äôs preferred inflation gauge, core PCE, showed that price increases accelerated in May, raising inflation concerns. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last week that he expects to see a pickup in inflation this summer, but reiterated his ‚Äúwait and see‚Äù approach. On Sunday, President Trump commented on the July 9 deadline for the 90-day tariff pause, stating, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I need to extend it, but could.‚Äù Economic Events June 30 to July 4 June‚Äôs ISM Manufacturing Purchasing Manager‚Äôs Index (PMI) is due on Tuesday. This report shows business conditions in the manufacturing sector and serves as a significant leading indicator of overall economic conditions. There are also job openings data due on Tuesday, which could reflect conditions in the labor market. Wednesday and Thursday will see more labor market reports, with nonfarm payrolls and unemployment figures released. These reports represent the number of new jobs created during the previous month, along with the percentage of people actively seeking employment. They are significant economic indicators, as the shift in the number of jobs is strongly associated with overall economic health. June‚Äôs ISM Services PMI, due on Thursday, will reflect business conditions in the services sector and is another leading economic indicator. Traditional markets are closed on Friday for the July 4 celebrations as we enter the second half of the year. Crypto Market Outlook Digital asset markets remained flat over the weekend but gained during early Asian trading on Monday morning to reach $3.46 trillion in total capitalization. Bitcoin has reached a two-week high, tapping $108,750 in early trading on Monday, but it faced resistance there yet again and fell back to $108,500 at the time of writing. The assed has struggled at this level at least five times over the past week where it has been rejected. Ethereum is doing a little better, having reached its support-turned-resistance level of $2,500 on Monday morning after a 2.8% gain. The altcoins were mostly in the green with minor gains, but Hyperliquid (HYPE) was leading the pack, adding 7.5% on the day to top $40.

2025-06-30T05:30:40,"BNB Chain rolls out Maxwell hardfork to reduce block time and enhance network responsiveness","Cryptocurrencies displayed strength over the weekend as Bitcoin extended above $105,000 to press time‚Äôs $108,568. While altcoins brace for significant bounce-backs, BNB Chain will officially roll out the Maxwell hardfork today, June 30, 2025. The upgrade aims to enrich Binance‚Äôs chain through enhanced efficiency and speed. BNB Chain @BNBCHAIN ¬∑ Follow ‚ö†Ô∏è Maxwell Hardfork goes live in a few hours, here‚Äôs everything you need to know üßµ üëá 8:24 PM ¬∑ Jun 29, 2025 130 Reply Copy link Read 56 replies First and foremost, Maxwell will halve BSC‚Äôs block time to only 0.75 seconds from 1.5 seconds, making it a sub-second platform. It‚Äôs noteworthy that today‚Äôs fork builds on last year‚Äôs Lorentz upgrade momentum, reflecting the team‚Äôs continued dedication to scalability, speed, and enriched user experience. BSC‚Äôs journey to efficiency: from Loretz upgrade to Maxwell BNB Chain is among the blockchain projects that take speed as a foundational element for success in the sector. It rolled out the Lorentz fork in April 2025 to reduce block times from 3 seconds to 1.5 seconds. The update brought noticeable enhancement across validator efficiency, dApp responsiveness, and DeFi performance. BNB Chain flourished after Lorentz. For instance, it delivered only a $0.04 transaction fee. Moreover, Dune‚Äôs data shows BSC outshined all decentralized exchanges (DEXs) in daily volume. Source ‚Äì Dune Analytics Meanwhile, the Maxwell upgrade will take these advancements to another level. Node operators, developers, and users can anticipate smooth app interactions and swift transaction confirmations. What to expect with Maxwell hardfork? The latest upgrade transforms BNB Smart Chain‚Äôs ecosystem with three main improvements. Firstly, it introduces BEP-524 to slash the block interval to 0.75 seconds. That means doubling BSC‚Äôs transaction throughput capability. Users will enjoy accelerated offerings from minting and token swaps to smart contract execution and GameFi activities. Secondly, Maxwell enhanced validator messaging by enhancing existing p2p communication models. That will reduce possible syncing lags, boosting network stability even during faster activities. Validators will experience fewer delays when proposing and voting on blocks. Finally, the BPE-564 standard introduces two messaging mechanisms, GetBlocksByRangeMsg and RangeBlocksMsg. These will enable nodes to synch massive block groups at once, enriching syncing speed and reliability across the BSC network. The Maxwell update isn‚Äôt about boosting speed alone. It represents a strategic step toward a more efficient and faster blockchain future. The upgrade reflects BSC‚Äôs dedication to dominating web3 adoption amid renewed demand for responsive performance in NFTs, DeFi, and online gaming. BNB price outlook The native token displayed bullishness as enthusiasts brace for network enhancements. BNB trades at $655 after rebounding from the support at $642. Chart by Coinamrketcap Its increasing daily trading volume suggests a possible upward continuation. Continued bullishness amid the Maxwell upgrade and broad market uptrends could fuel BNB‚Äôs price to the next resistance at $720. A breakout might propel the token to the crucial obstacle at $760, beyond which BNB will shift its trajectory to bullishness. However, sudden selling pressure might cause the token to plunge to the support barrier at $520-$540.

2025-06-30T05:30:07,"Why is Bitcoin Stuck at $100,000 and Not Rising? Analyst Explains the Real Reason","Charles Edwards, CEO of cryptocurrency analysis company Capriole Investments, made remarkable statements about the stagnation in the Bitcoin price and recent market dynamics. According to Edwards, the reason Bitcoin is stuck at $100,000 levels despite the interest (FOMO) from institutional investors is due to selling pressure from long-term investors. Edwards stated that since the spot ETF launch in January 2024, long-term Bitcoin holders (LTH) have been selling to Wall Street and liquidating their positions. Stating that this situation is reflected in the media in different ways, Edwards argued that the real reason is these sales. The CEO recalled a prediction he made in April, saying that companies holding Bitcoin treasury would create a ‚Äúflywheel‚Äù effect, triggering a massive buying wave in the market and pushing the ETF narrative to the background. Edwards said that this effect is now clearly visible and many new companies are joining this trend. Related News: Latest Report on Cryptocurrency Owners in South Korea Released - Major Changes Are Underway, Here Are the Trends Examining on-chain data, Edwards explained that there has been a huge increase in the number of investors holding BTC for more than 6 months in the last two months, and that the purchases made by this group more than covered all the BTC sold by LTHs in the last 1.5 years. He evaluated this situation as ‚Äúincredible.‚Äù Edwards also stated that such aggressive increases are usually followed by price squeezes, which is a short-term bullish sign. However, Edwards noted that there is still some weakness in the general on-chain data, and stated that recovery is possible if this buying momentum continues: ‚ÄúCan Treasury companies continue this rapid pace of buying? I think this cycle is just beginning. If aggressive buying by investors with a 6-month holding continues, the market could overcome this weakness.‚Äù *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-30T05:30:00,"BTC Could Surge as Youth Lose Faith in Traditional Finance","Market strategist Jordi Visser argues that economic disillusionment among younger generations, combined with rapid advancements in AI and automation, will erode faith in traditional capitalist models and fuel demand for decentralized assets like Bitcoin. Former President Donald Trump also weighed in by praising Bitcoin‚Äôs role in alleviating pressure on the US dollar and subtly referencing the Triffin Dilemma. This is a core flaw in the dollar‚Äôs global reserve status. Meanwhile, Human Rights Foundation‚Äôs Alex Gladstein pointed out Bitcoin‚Äôs use as a shield against authoritarian control due to its censorship-resistant qualities and historical utility in pro-democracy movements. With increasing distrust in fiat currencies, ballooning government debt, and weakening institutional credibility, all of these narratives come together to present Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a growing pillar in both economic realignment and individual empowerment. Younger Generations Turning to Bitcoin Market analyst Jordi Visser offered a provocative outlook on the future of Bitcoin, and suggested that the disillusionment of younger generations with the existing economic order could be a major force behind the cryptocurrency‚Äôs long-term price appreciation. On a recent episode of entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano‚Äôs podcast, Visser said that people aged 25 and younger are becoming increasingly skeptical of capitalism and are instead advocating for a new system rooted in greater public spending and expansive social benefits. This generational shift, he argues, is being fueled by economic uncertainty, the erosion of trust in traditional institutions, and the looming threat of widespread job displacement caused by artificial intelligence. According to Visser, the growing frustration and lack of faith in the current system are prompting governments to ramp up spending to try and placate the masses‚Äîan action that inevitably leads to more money printing. He believes that this ongoing reliance on fiat currency and debt-driven economics will only strengthen the case for Bitcoin as an alternative store of value. ‚ÄúThe more people are angry, the more money the government has to print,‚Äù Visser explained. This cycle of monetary expansion will drive Bitcoin‚Äôs price higher over time, regardless of public perception or institutional resistance. He predicts that Bitcoin will increasingly replace fiat assets as it becomes a more trusted financial instrument. AI protest Visser also issued a broader warning about the long-term viability of capitalism itself. He suggested that the rapid development of AI and robotic technologies‚Äîespecially humanoid robots and autonomous vehicles‚Äîcould make human labor obsolete, further concentrating wealth in the hands of a few and destabilizing the capitalist framework. He believes this technological shift is imminent, with commercial adoption of self-driving cars and robotic labor likely within five years. These kinds of advancements, he said, will act as a wake-up call for society. He beieleves it will force a reevaluation of existing economic models and accelerate interest in decentralized assets like Bitcoin. Trump Says Bitcoin Eases Pressure on the Dollar President Donald Trump also recently expressed his strong support for Bitcoin by praising its growing role in the US economy during a White House press conference on Friday. Trump described the cryptocurrency industry as ‚Äúamazing,‚Äù due to its job creation potential and increasing use as a means of payment. He suggested that Bitcoin helps relieve pressure on the US dollar, a statement that digital asset researcher Anders X believes alludes to the Triffin Dilemma. This is a long-standing economic conflict where the issuer of the world‚Äôs reserve currency must sacrifice domestic monetary stability to meet global demand for liquidity. As the issuer of the global reserve currency, the United States is required to maintain persistent trade deficits in order to supply enough dollars to the global market. While this practice supports international trade and provides a short-term solution to global liquidity needs, it undermines the long-term value of the dollar due to ongoing money creation. This systemic contradiction fuels concerns about currency debasement and inflation. Trump‚Äôs previous comments about potentially paying off national debt with Bitcoin means that there is a growing awareness of the contrast between the inflation-prone dollar and Bitcoin‚Äôs capped supply. Critics, however, point out that even if the US Treasury were to acquire the entire Bitcoin supply, it would fall far short of covering the nation‚Äôs ballooning $37 trillion debt . With deficits continuing to rise, many analysts believe this debt trajectory is unsustainable and could ultimately lead to a collapse in the dollar‚Äôs value. Macroeconomist Lyn Alden captured this sentiment with the now-famous phrase ‚Äúnothing stops this train.‚Äù This reflects the consensus that governments will continue printing money indefinitely. This pessimism is already playing out in financial markets. The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the dollar‚Äôs strength against a basket of other major currencies, recently fell to its lowest level in three years. At the same time, US government bond yields are still elevated, which signals weakening investor confidence in the government‚Äôs ability to manage its debt responsibly. Bitcoin Rescues People From Tyranny At the Bitcoin Policy Summit in Washington, D.C., Human Rights Foundation chief strategy officer Alex Gladstein addressed a room of American political leaders, and talked about Bitcoin‚Äôs critical role in countering authoritarian regimes. Gladstein pointed out that Bitcoin continues to prove itself as a powerful financial tool for people living under oppressive governments by offering a decentralized alternative to state-controlled fiat systems. According to him, when used correctly‚Äîwithout tying personal identity to transactions‚ÄîBitcoin makes it a lot harder for governments to monitor, freeze, or seize individual assets. Gladstein stated that one of Bitcoin‚Äôs most valuable features is its resistance to manipulation by authoritarian leaders. Unlike fiat currencies, which can be inflated or weaponized to exert control over citizens, Bitcoin cannot be hyperinflated, and self-custodied wallets remain outside the reach of state interference. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre self-custoding your Bitcoin, governments can‚Äôt delete or freeze your stuff, and they certainly can‚Äôt hyperinflate you,‚Äù he said. He shared that the Human Rights Foundation first recognized Bitcoin‚Äôs potential during Ukraine‚Äôs 2013 pro-democracy protests against then-President Viktor Yanukovych. Protesters at the time faced frozen bank accounts, yet Bitcoin provided a way to receive financial support when traditional banking systems failed. Despite initial skepticism‚ÄîBitcoin was valued at just $100 then‚Äîthe technology proved very effective when it came to delivering funds across borders and into the hands of those fighting for democratic freedoms. Gladstein concluded that Bitcoin already helped countless people escape the financial reach of authoritarian governments and continues to do so. Since joining the Human Rights Foundation in 2007, he saw firsthand how the technology empowers people in regions where human rights are regularly violated. According to him, Bitcoin is not just a technological innovation but a tool for resistance, making it, as he put it, ‚Äúbad for dictators.‚Äù",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9743/btc-could-surge-as-youth-lose-faith-in-traditional-finance,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

He admitted he was initially late to the game, buying his first Bitcoin at $6,000. At the time, it felt expensive. But looking back, he wishes he had purchased more. WHAT IS EXPENSIVE? I was late into Bitcoin. I waited too long‚Ä¶.which may have been a good thing. I waited because I did not understand today‚Äôs modern money. So I bought my first Bitcoin at $6000 a coin. It was expensive. Today I wish I had bought more at $6000. Today‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) June 30, 2025 He shared his regret about not buying more gold, silver, and Bitcoin earlier. He blames his hesitation on being too focused on fiat money, which he calls ‚Äúfake money.‚Äù He also reflected on how many people regret not chasing their dreams, especially later in life. Buying Bitcoin at $107K Now that Bitcoin trades around $107,000, Kiyosaki acknowledges the same feeling, thinking it‚Äôs too expensive. Yet, he‚Äôs still buying more. His reasoning is quite simple, as he explains that if Bitcoin hits $1 million, he knows he‚Äôll look back on today‚Äôs price and feel the same regret for not buying more. That‚Äôs why he urges people to stop obsessing over price tags and instead pay attention to how much of an asset they own. He believes poor people tend to focus too much on price, while the wealthy focus on accumulating quantity. Whether it‚Äôs gold, silver, or Bitcoin, Kiyosaki says he doesn‚Äôt worry about daily price swings. For him, the key is building up holdings over time, not trying to time the perfect entry. Power on One Satoshi Kiyosaki encouraged even small investors to participate. Even if someone can only afford one Satoshi, the smallest unit of Bitcoin, he believes they‚Äôll be grateful in five years.

The company issued an update on June 29 via X, outlining a phased recovery process starting with verified users. According to the statement, only spot wallets are being unlocked initially, with other wallet types to follow once identity verification is completed. Users are being asked to wait for confirmation before attempting to access their balances, which will be displayed gradually as the security checks proceed. Follow- up on Nobitex Security Incident, Step-by-step wallet access has begun, 29 June 2025 Please note: 1. This process is being carried out gradually, starting with verified users and initially for spot wallets, followed by other types of wallets. 2. The identity‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Nobitex | ŸÜŸàÿ®€åÿ™⁄©ÿ≥ (@nobitexmarket) June 29, 2025 ‚ÄúOnce the accuracy and security of all information is confirmed, Nobitex will begin displaying wallet balances in phases,‚Äù the exchange wrote. Nobitex expects the process to finish by mid-week but noted that timelines could shift based on technical and security considerations. The exploit , carried out on June 18, was claimed by Gonjeshke Darande, a pro-Israel group also known as Predatory Sparrow. Blockchain investigators say roughly $90‚Äì100 million in digital assets were drained from hot wallets across Ethereum ( ETH ) and Tron ( TRX ), including Bitcoin ( BTC ), ETH, and Dogecoin ( DOGE ). You might also like: Over $90M stolen from Iran‚Äôs Nobitex exchange burnt by pro-Israel hacker group As part of its post-attack response, Nobitex is migrating to a new wallet system. The firm warned users not to deposit funds into previously used addresses, noting that any deposits to old wallets may result in permanent loss. ‚ÄúIf your old deposit address is connected to a mining rig or saved as a default withdrawal address in a blockchain service, make sure to delete it an,‚Äù the update advised, stressing the risk of sending funds to invalid wallets. The hackers reportedly accessed the platform using employee credentials compromised earlier via infostealer malware. The breach exposed parts of Nobitex‚Äôs internal systems, including source code and server data, which were later leaked online. Nobitex, which has processed more than $11 billion in inflows to date, holds a dominant position among Iran-based exchanges. Chainalysis has previously linked it to illicit activities by ransomware groups affiliated with Iran‚Äôs Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and sanctioned Russian entities. With user access gradually resuming and trading features still disabled, the exchange is working to stabilize operations and restore trust. ‚ÄúWe are working to resume withdrawal, deposit, and trading services for verified users with minimal delay,‚Äù the exchange said. Full platform functionality is expected to return in the coming days, though Nobitex has warned that the timeline may be revised depending on the results of ongoing system checks.

2025-06-30T04:30:30,"Best Crypto Presales for 2025: Experts Select Top New Cryptocurrencies for High Potential Returns","As Bitcoin approaches $108,000 and altcoins regain strength on the back of ETF momentum, institutional flows, and regulatory optimism, presale tokens are emerging as key opportunities for investors seeking outsized gains. Analysts are pointing to a mix of politically charged meme tokens, high-speed Layer-2s, and payment solutions as the top crypto bets of the second half of 2025. Here are the six presales experts are watching closely: MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGAFINANCE) Positioned as the political meme coin of 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing early interest with bold branding and rapid momentum. Analysts note that it has already become a focus for high-risk, high-reward traders looking for aggressive ROI setups before broader market exposure. With a campaign-driven narrative and increasing mentions in early presale rankings, MAGACOIN FINANCE may be emerging as the cycle‚Äôs standout meme contender. Early investors and market analysts are closely tracking its high-volume interest and accelerated wallet activity. MAGACOIN FINANCE isn‚Äôt aiming for utility‚Äîit‚Äôs engineered for attention, speculation, and potential fast-paced growth. In a market increasingly driven by narrative and emotion, this token appears designed to dominate headlines and trader sentiment as listings draw near. Qubetics ($TICS) Qubetics is positioning itself as a Layer-1 Web3 aggregator. It has raised over $18 million and confirmed a top-tier exchange listing. Its roadmap includes tools like a multi-chain wallet and tokenization marketplace, though some concerns remain around delivery timelines. Solaxy (SOLX) Solaxy is a Layer-2 solution for Solana with deflationary tokenomics and a $58 million presale. It launched in late June 2025 with cross-chain capabilities and high staking APYs, but transparency issues and future execution are under watch. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) Bitcoin Hyper brings Solana-like speed to a Bitcoin-secured network, using SVM for scaling. With audit clearance and a Q3 2025 launch, HYPER is drawing some attention‚Äîbut still early-stage. BTC Bull ($BTCBULL) BTC Bull ties its meme token value to Bitcoin price milestones, triggering burns and rewards. Backed by community hype and a bullish BTC trend, it‚Äôs speculative but may benefit from macro momentum. Remittix (RTX) Remittix offers crypto-to-fiat remittance infrastructure with flat fees and multi-currency support. It‚Äôs raised over $15 million and targets financial utility, though competition in PayFi remains high. Final Words While multiple presales are gaining attention in 2025, none are commanding momentum quite like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Built for speed, speculation, and cultural virality, it‚Äôs leading the charge as the token most likely to deliver outsized returns this cycle. Traders hunting for the next 50x or 100x return are increasingly viewing MAGACOIN FINANCE as more than a meme‚Äîit‚Äôs becoming a cultural signal in 2025‚Äôs crypto cycle. With listing anticipation building and retail FOMO increasing, experts suggest this could be the year MAGACOIN FINANCE dominates presale performance charts. As other projects navigate roadmaps and utility narratives, MAGACOIN FINANCE is already turning heads with raw buyer interest and breakout potential. For traders seeking pure upside in a hype-driven market, this is the name to watch.

This level has proven difficult for XRP to break in recent days, with the token getting rejected each time it approaches this zone. A confirmed move above $2.20, with prices holding steadily, could open the door for a rally toward the next target around $2.25. The next resistance area sits between $2.30 and $2.35. Support Zones to Watch On the downside, XRP has strong support levels between $2.10 and $2.07. If prices drop, these levels are expected to attract buying interest and potentially stabilize the market. As of now, XRP seems to be trading sideways within this range, showing no clear breakout in either direction. A Market Moving with Bitcoin XRP‚Äôs next big move could depend heavily on what Bitcoin does next. If Bitcoin struggles to break through its own resistance levels, altcoins like XRP could follow a similar path, staying range-bound for a little longer. On the other hand, if Bitcoin makes a strong breakout, it might give XRP the momentum it needs to move higher. Long-Term Outlook Still Positive Looking at the bigger picture, XRP has been holding firm within a wider price channel for several months. While the short-term trend appears neutral, the long-term setup remains bullish as long as prices stay above key support levels. On the bullish side, XRP now has over 7.1 million wallets.. The price may be taking a short break, but another big move could be coming soon. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.19.

This persistent inability to break through has characterized the cryptocurrency‚Äôs performance in recent weeks, leaving analysts to speculate on its next moves. Analyst Predicts Major Upswing Crypto analyst Doctor Profit has outlined two potential scenarios for the Bitcoin price trajectory in the near term, offering insights into both immediate volatility and a long-term bullish outlook. In a recent post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Doctor Profit emphasized the significance of the current market conditions, suggesting that Bitcoin could reach between $120,000 and $150,000 in the coming months. Related Reading: Dogecoin Silent Build-Up: Double Bottom Hints At Explosive Move To $0.47 According to Doctor Profit, the market is poised for a breakout. He noted, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre standing in front of a breakout, one that has the potential to send Bitcoin into the $120,000‚Äì$150,000 zone over the next few months.‚Äù This assertion is supported by data reflecting strong on-chain activity, favorable technical structures, liquidity flow, and macroeconomic factors. While the long-term outlook appears promising, he cautioned that short-term fluctuations will remain prevalent. Two Scenarios For The Bitcoin Price Doctor Profit outlined two primary outcomes that traders should consider. The first scenario involves a bullish breakout from a bull flag pattern, allowing Bitcoin to surge past the $113,000 resistance level and continue climbing without a pullback. However, the analyst views this scenario as overly simplistic, suggesting that market makers typically prefer not to allow such parabolic moves to occur without a preceding shakeout. The second scenario, which appears more likely, involves either a rejection at the bull flag breakout or a liquidity grab at the $113,000 mark. This would potentially lead Bitcoin to revisit the lower boundary of the current range, around $90,000 to $93,000. Doctor Profit noted that this region is attractive because it contains significant liquidity and a notable gap in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) futures market. He views a dip to these levels not as a bearish signal, but rather as an opportunity to accumulate more Bitcoin. In his analysis, he stated, ‚Äú$93K is not bearish. It‚Äôs clearly a gift!.‚Äù Doctor Profit believes that this potential dip would not only reset market leverage but also shake out weaker hands, creating a more robust foundation for a subsequent rally. Macroeconomic Trends Favor BTC Looking at the long-term prospects, Doctor Profit highlighted that larger wallets continue to accumulate Bitcoin, indicating that major investors are positioning themselves for a significant upward movement. He pointed to macroeconomic indicators, particularly the M2 money supply, which suggests that Bitcoin remains undervalued relative to broader economic trends. Related Reading: TD Sequential Flashes Buy: Dogecoin Ready For Rebound To $0.21 Notably, the Bitcoin price has been trading within its current range for 226 days, which echoes patterns observed during previous accumulation phases before major price breakouts. As Doctor Profit concluded, the Bitcoin price trajectory remains optimistic, with expectations of reaching between $120,000 and $150,000 in the foreseeable future. He notes that while there are multiple paths to achieving this target, a dip into the $90,000 to $93,000 range would provide a crucial opportunity for accumulation and set the stage for a powerful upward move.

2025-06-30T03:00:44,"Top US Finance Expert: Bitcoin Deserves A Bigger Slice Of Your Portfolio","US financial advisor Ric Edelman has upped his Bitcoin recommendation from a cautious 1% to a bold 10‚Äì40% of investors‚Äô portfolios. He points to the January 2024 launch of US Bitcoin spot ETFs, which funneled in more than $10 billion in their opening months, as proof that digital assets are here to stay. Having watched governments and major firms embrace crypto, he now believes the risks that once held him back are largely behind us. Strong Growth In Bitcoin ETFs According to reports, the launch of US Bitcoin spot exchange‚Äëtraded funds in January 2024 opened the floodgates. These ETFs have drawn in billions of dollars and put digital currency at the front of many investors‚Äô minds. Sales figures show that ETFs poured in more than $10‚ÄØbillion in their first months on the market. Those numbers have convinced many that Bitcoin is no longer a niche play. Major Players Show Their Hand Based on interviews and filings, nation‚Äëstates like Pakistan and the UAE have started to add Bitcoin to their reserves. Public companies such as MicroStrategy (now Strategy ) and Metaplanet keep buying more coins, while big finance names‚ÄîBarclays Bank, Avenir, and Goldman Sachs‚Äîhave dipped their toes in through those same ETFs. This level of interest would have sounded impossible back in 2020 when Bitcoin was still seen as an experiment. Questioning The 60/40 Rule Edelman pointed out that the classic 60% stocks and 40% bonds formula isn‚Äôt cutting it anymore. With people living longer and bond yields at historic lows, retirement accounts are in need of a boost. He contends that Bitcoin‚Äôs gains over the past decade have outpaced every other major asset class. Based on charts, Bitcoin climbed over 1,400% between 2015 and 2025, while the S&P‚ÄØ500 posted around 250% in the same span. Bold Price Goals On The Table Analysts aren‚Äôt holding back when it comes to price targets. Some see Bitcoin hitting $500,000 or $1 million in this cycle. High‚Äëprofile backers go even further‚ÄîMichael Saylor has talked about $13 million per coin if certain on‚Äëchain signals line up. These figures sound wild. They also explain why a 40% allocation could feel tempting to aggressive investors. Balancing Risk And Reward Still, experts warn that Bitcoin‚Äôs swings remain sharp. Prices can rise or fall by 20% in a day. A 40% weighting means big gains when markets rally and big losses when they drop. Many advisors suggest a smaller 5‚Äì10% Bitcoin holding for those who want some upside without risking their entire nest egg. What This Means Based on reports from the Digital Asset Council of Financial Advisors, everyday investors might not need to go all‚Äëin just yet. A gradual approach can help you learn the market and adjust if volatility spikes. It‚Äôs a fast‚Äëmoving scene, so keeping an eye on ETF inflows, regulatory updates, and network health will be key.

2025-06-30T02:24:54,"Projected XRP Price If It Reclaims Half of Its Peak Market Dominance","As the total cryptocurrency market capitalization exceeds $3.28 trillion, discussions have resurfaced around XRP‚Äôs underperformance relative to other major assets. Despite its early presence and significant impact during previous market cycles, XRP has not mirrored the broader growth seen across the crypto sector over the past decade. Analysts suggest that even a partial recovery of its past market dominance could trigger a significant price increase. XRP‚Äôs Lagging Growth Compared to the Market Over the last ten years, the global cryptocurrency market has surged from $4.28 billion to over $3.28 trillion, a staggering 76,528% increase. Bitcoin and several altcoins have grown in parallel with this expansion, recording gains that align with or exceed the market‚Äôs pace. XRP, however, has not followed this trend. A key factor limiting XRP‚Äôs growth has been ongoing regulatory challenges, most notably its legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These issues led to temporary delistings from major exchanges, restricting access for U.S.-based investors and stalling momentum during critical growth periods. Historical Market Dominance: XRP vs. Bitcoin In May 2017, XRP reached its peak market dominance of 31.33%, supported by a market capitalization of $15.28 billion when the total crypto market was $48.78 billion. At the same time, Bitcoin‚Äôs market cap stood at $29 billion, giving it a 59.45% share of the total market. Since then, Bitcoin has grown in line with the market. Its capitalization has risen to $2.132 trillion, a 7,251% increase from 2017. XRP, on the other hand, has climbed only 743% during the same period, reaching a market cap of $128.8 billion. Consequently, XRP‚Äôs market dominance has dropped from 31.33% to just 3.96%, while Bitcoin‚Äôs has increased to 65.75%. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Price Projections Based on Reclaiming Market Share Given the current crypto market cap of $3.28 trillion, analysts have explored hypothetical scenarios in which XRP regains a portion of its former dominance. If XRP were to recover just half of its 2017 market dominance, 15.665%, its market capitalization would rise to approximately $513.8 billion. With the circulating supply of XRP estimated at 59 billion tokens, this would result in a price of roughly $8.70 per coin. Notably, this aligns with predictions made by industry figures such as George Tung, who has suggested that XRP could realistically reach $8 to $10 under favourable conditions by the end of the year. While some commentators see $8 as a significant target, others argue that it still undervalues XRP‚Äôs full potential, especially given its historical market standing. What If XRP Fully Recovers Its Past Dominance? In a more aggressive scenario, where XRP returns to its full 31.33% dominance, its market capitalization would exceed $1.027 trillion at the current overall market valuation. Based on the existing supply, this would drive the price of one XRP token to approximately $17.40 . Although achieving such a market share would require a significant shift in investor sentiment and regulatory clarity, the figures suggest that substantial upside remains possible, even if XRP only partially regains its historical position. XRP‚Äôs current valuation appears modest when measured against its historical performance and the broader market‚Äôs growth. A return to just half of its peak market dominance would more than quadruple its current price, while a full recovery could propel XRP to levels not previously reached. These scenarios, although hypothetical, provide a framework for evaluating XRP‚Äôs long-term potential in a maturing cryptocurrency market.

2025-06-30T02:04:53,"Spanish Coffee Chain Vanadi approves ‚Ç¨1B Bitcoin bet","The board of directors of Vanadi Coffee, a publicly traded coffee chain headquartered in Alicante, Spain, has just signed off on a plan to see the company invest up to ‚Ç¨1 billion ‚Äî roughly $1.17 billion ‚Äî in Bitcoin. The move , approved by shareholders on June 29, signals a significant departure of the company from previous financial policies , pushing it to the vanguard of corporate adoption of Bitcoin in Spain. A new solution for Bitcoin adherents, the firm has so far purchased 54 BTC, worth around ‚Ç¨5.8 million at current prices, and is also eyeing wider expansions. In a recent filing with BME Growth ‚Äî Spain‚Äôs growth division for small- and medium-sized enterprises ‚Äî Vanadi hinted that they wished to become the largest business holder of Bitcoin in Spain. Vanadi‚Äôs stock price went parabolic following the company‚Äôs Bitcoin play, increasing more than threefold in June. The increase marks an apparent increase in investor appetite for companies leveraging digital assets as a treasury strategy . Vanadi had said in its translated announcement: ‚ÄúSimilar to companies such as Strategy or Metaplanet, Vanadi Coffee redefines its business model and will use Bitcoin as its main reserve asset and accumulate large amounts of Bitcoin as part of its treasury.‚Äù The company is looking to replicate the high-wager Bitcoin treasury models of Strategy, which holds over 200,000 BTC, and Metaplanet. The Japanese firm has recently tweaked its balance sheet policy to the pro-Bitcoin side. Vanadi struggles to recover with a Bitcoin bet Vanadi‚Äôs had been struggling financially and operationally; its 2024 financial statement lists that it was operating at a loss of ‚Ç¨3.3m, an increase of 15.8% from the previous period. Competition and operating costs have eaten away at profitability bit by bit as the cost of coffee has risen ever higher, dragging the firm further into financial strain. Meanwhile, Vanadi was looking for more money to build long-term. It received two large investment offers in May. One was from a tiny local software consultancy, a one-man outfit in Alicante, and he offered 50 million euros. The other was Alpha Blue Ocean, an international firm that announced it would back 15 companies in 15 countries with over ‚Ç¨1.5 billion in investment. Critics raise concerns over Vanadi‚Äôs ambitious Bitcoin move Vanadi‚Äôs daring foray into Bitcoin is not risk-free. The company has a handful of stores serving espresso and pastries, and it is now dipping a toe in the complex world of crypto treasury management. But analysts and sceptics have raised red flags. They also note that Vanadi‚Äôs small size, slim operating margins and inexperience in crypto could be left open to volatility and then to scrutiny by regulators. Unlike Strategy, whose tech-focused leadership team has many years of experience navigating capital markets, Vanadi‚Äôs management has a steep learning curve ahead. And the regulatory climate for digital assets in Spain is also conservative. It‚Äôs not part of an activist group, but it is dynamic, and screwing any of this up in compliance or implementation would be expensive. Vanadi is not alone, though. Companies worldwide are adding Bitcoin to their treasury, which is becoming a trend. US-based crypto firm Bakkt recently revealed its intentions to purchase as much as $1 billion of Bitcoin. Tesla and Coinbase are among the companies that have pursued comparable treasury strategies. What sets Vanadi apart, however, is the scale of its ambition relative to its core business. A ‚Ç¨1 billion Bitcoin bet on a caf√© chain with six locations and persistent losses is an aggressive bet by any measure.
