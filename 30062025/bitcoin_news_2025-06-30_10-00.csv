2025-06-30T07:50:20,"Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Crucial Insights for Market Sentiment","BitcoinWorld Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Crucial Insights for Market Sentiment Are you feeling the pulse of the cryptocurrency market? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a powerful tool designed to give you a snapshot of prevailing emotions, helping you understand whether market participants are feeling overly optimistic or overly cautious. As of June 30, this crucial indicator, provided by software development platform Alternative, registered a value of 66. While this is a slight dip from the previous day, it firmly keeps the market in the ‘Greed’ zone, signaling a continued bullish sentiment despite recent fluctuations. But what does this number truly tell us about the future of Bitcoin price and the broader crypto landscape? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: What Does it Mean? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is more than just a number; it’s a barometer of the collective emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. Ranging from 0 to 100, it aims to quantify market sentiment, where: 0-24 (Extreme Fear): Indicates investors are highly worried, often leading to selling pressure and potential buying opportunities for brave investors. 25-49 (Fear): Still a cautious market, but less intense than extreme fear. 50-54 (Neutral): A balanced market where neither fear nor greed dominates. 55-74 (Greed): Suggests investors are becoming overly optimistic, potentially leading to overvaluation. 75-100 (Extreme Greed): A highly euphoric market, often a precursor to market corrections as assets become significantly overbought. Historically, moments of extreme fear have often coincided with market bottoms, presenting lucrative entry points for long-term investors. Conversely, periods of extreme greed have frequently preceded market tops, serving as a warning sign for potential pullbacks. How is Crypto Market Sentiment Measured? The brilliance of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index lies in its multi-faceted approach to gauging crypto market sentiment . It doesn’t rely on a single data point but aggregates information from six key factors, each weighted differently to provide a comprehensive overview. Let’s break down these components: 1. Volatility (25%) This component measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average over the last 30 and 90 days. High volatility, especially on the downside, typically indicates fear, while stable or upward volatility might suggest growing confidence. 2. Market Momentum/Volume (25%) This factor analyzes the current volume and market momentum of Bitcoin and compares it with average values. High buying volume in a rising market suggests greedy behavior, while low volume or high selling volume indicates fear. 3. Social Media (15%) The index scours various social media platforms, primarily Twitter (now X), for specific keywords and hashtags related to cryptocurrency. A high number of positive or trending posts often indicates a surge in interest and potentially greedy sentiment, whereas negative sentiment or a lack of engagement can signal fear. 4. Surveys (15%) – Currently Paused Although currently paused, this component historically involved weekly polls where thousands of people shared their perceptions of the crypto market. Surveys offer a direct insight into investor psychology, providing a raw measure of fear or greed. The temporary pause means the index currently relies more heavily on the other five factors. 5. Bitcoin Dominance (10%) Bitcoin’s dominance refers to its market capitalization share relative to the entire cryptocurrency market. An increasing Bitcoin dominance often suggests a flight to safety, indicating fear in the altcoin market as investors consolidate into Bitcoin. Conversely, a decreasing dominance might indicate greed, as investors venture into riskier altcoins for higher potential returns. 6. Google Trends (10%) This factor analyzes Google search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. A sudden surge in searches for terms like ‘Bitcoin price manipulation’ or ‘Bitcoin crash’ indicates fear, while searches for ‘how to buy Bitcoin’ or ‘Bitcoin bullish’ might suggest growing public interest and potential greed. By combining these diverse data points, the index offers a robust, albeit not infallible, indicator of overall market sentiment. What Does a ‘Greed’ Zone Reading of 66 Imply for Bitcoin Price? The current reading of 66, firmly in the ‘Greed’ zone, suggests that investors are generally optimistic about the market’s future. This level of greed, while not extreme, indicates that many participants are willing to take on more risk, potentially driving prices higher. However, the slight drop from the previous day (down two points) hints at a cooling off of this intense optimism, suggesting that while greed is still prevalent, it might be moderating. This subtle shift could be a healthy sign, preventing the market from becoming excessively overheated and prone to sharp corrections. For Bitcoin price , a ‘Greed’ reading typically implies continued buying pressure. Historically, sustained periods in the greed zone have preceded significant price rallies. However, it’s also a reminder that prices cannot go up indefinitely. As the saying goes, ‘be fearful when others are greedy.’ This moderate greed level might indicate a period of consolidation or minor pullbacks before the next leg up, offering opportunities for strategic entries rather than chasing pumps. Mastering Your Crypto Trading Strategy with the Fear & Greed Index Incorporating the Crypto Fear & Greed Index into your crypto trading strategy can significantly enhance your decision-making, but it’s crucial to use it wisely. It serves as an emotional compass, not a definitive buy/sell signal. Here’s how you can leverage it: Contrarian Investing: The most common application. When the index is in ‘Extreme Fear,’ it might be an opportune time to consider buying, as assets are likely undervalued due to panic selling. Conversely, when it hits ‘Extreme Greed,’ it might be time to take profits or reduce exposure, as the market could be overbought. Risk Management: During periods of ‘Greed,’ especially ‘Extreme Greed,’ consider tightening your stop-losses or reducing position sizes. High sentiment often precedes increased market volatility on the downside. Confirmation Tool: Use the index to confirm other technical or fundamental analysis. If your charts show a potential reversal and the index is showing ‘Extreme Fear,’ it adds conviction to your bullish outlook. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: For long-term investors, extreme fear can be a signal to accumulate. For short-term traders, the index can help time entries and exits around sentiment-driven swings. Remember, the index is just one piece of the puzzle. Always combine its insights with thorough research, technical analysis, and an understanding of market fundamentals. Never make investment decisions based solely on a single indicator. Navigating Market Volatility: A Key Challenge in Crypto One of the defining characteristics of the cryptocurrency market is its inherent market volatility . Prices can swing wildly in short periods, influenced by a myriad of factors from regulatory news to whale movements, and of course, sentiment. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index helps contextualize this volatility by showing the underlying emotional drivers. When the index fluctuates rapidly between fear and greed, it often signals periods of heightened uncertainty and choppiness. Understanding this relationship can help investors brace for sudden movements and adjust their risk exposure accordingly. For instance, a sharp increase in the index from ‘Fear’ to ‘Greed’ might precede a strong upward trend, but also indicates increased risk of a sudden correction as euphoria takes hold. Conversely, a sustained period in ‘Fear’ might present a ‘buy the dip’ opportunity for those comfortable with high risk, anticipating a rebound once the panic subsides. It’s about recognizing the emotional cycle and not getting swept away by it. The Psychology Behind the Numbers: Why Sentiment Matters At its core, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index taps into the powerful psychological forces that drive financial markets. Human emotions—fear and greed—are often the primary catalysts for irrational decisions, leading to market bubbles and crashes. Greed can lead to FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), causing investors to buy at inflated prices, while fear can lead to panic selling, causing them to sell at a loss. The index provides a quantifiable measure of these emotions, allowing investors to potentially counter their own biases and make more rational choices. Recognizing when the collective market is overly emotional can give you an edge. It’s about stepping back, assessing the broader sentiment, and making decisions that go against the herd mentality when appropriate. This contrarian approach, famously advocated by legendary investors, is precisely what the index helps facilitate. Conclusion: A Compass, Not a Crystal Ball, for Your Crypto Journey The Crypto Fear & Greed Index remains an invaluable tool for any cryptocurrency enthusiast or investor. While its current reading of 66 places the market firmly in the ‘Greed’ zone, indicating continued optimism, the slight dip suggests a healthy moderation of this sentiment. It provides crucial insights into crypto market sentiment , helping you gauge the prevailing emotional winds that influence Bitcoin price and the broader digital asset space. By understanding its components and how to integrate it into your crypto trading strategy , you can better navigate the inherent market volatility and avoid emotionally driven mistakes. Remember, no single indicator guarantees success. The index is a compass, not a crystal ball. Use it as part of a comprehensive analytical framework, combining its insights with fundamental analysis, technical indicators, and sound risk management practices. Staying informed and disciplined is key to thriving in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies.

2025-06-30T07:43:24,"Will Bitcoin retrace as “apparent demand” signal flips negative?","Bitcoin’s recent price rebound has brought the asset closer to its record highs, but a new on-chain signal may be flashing caution. According to a June 29 analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Crazzyblockk, Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) “apparent demand” signal has turned negative, indicating that new buyer interest is no longer keeping pace with the supply entering the market from miners and long-term holders. Apparent demand is a metric that compares new buyer interest to the supply entering the market. Specifically, it looks at how much fresh demand is coming in relative to two main sources of supply; the newly mined Bitcoin and long-term holders moving their coins after a period of dormancy. Strong demand offsets this supply and helps push prices higher. A price imbalance may result when apparent demand turns negative, which indicates that new buyers are no longer consuming the available supply. In this case, selling by LTHs, who are often regarded as seasoned, strategic market participants, may suggest that the current price range is a local peak. You might also like: ‘Bitcoin is the hurdle rate’: What does it mean in the age of crypto? At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $108,190, up 0.8% in the past 24 hours. The price has moved between $100,546 and $108,706 in the last seven days and currently sits 3% below its all-time high of $111,814 set on May 22. From a technical perspective, Bitcoin is still trading in the upper range of its Bollinger Bands, and the price closing above the 20-day moving average indicates short-term bullish momentum. However, there’s still a lot of resistance in the $109,000–$110,000 range. Bitcoin price analysis. Credit: crypto.news At 56.89, the relative strength index is neutral but on the verge of becoming overbought. Bullish control would be re-established with a breakout above $111,000, but a rejection and decline below $105,000 might signal a more significant pullback toward $101,000. Looking ahead, macroeconomic events could have a significant impact on how prices move in the coming days. Traders will be paying close attention to what central bank leaders have to say at the European Central Bank forum this week. Jerome Powell, Federal Reserve Chair, is scheduled to speak on Tuesday, July 1, alongside his counterparts from the UK, South Korea, and Japan. While Powell recently told lawmakers that the Fed is in no rush to cut interest rates, political pressure is mounting. U.S. President Donald Trump criticized Powell for keeping rates “artificially high” on a June 29 interview. In the absence of strong apparent demand and unfavourable macroeconomic projectoons, Bitcoin may struggle to power through resistance without fresh catalysts. Read more: Is the crypto bull run here?

2025-06-30T07:30:59,"Ric Edelman Urges Financial Advisors to Consider Up to 40% Crypto Allocations","Veteran financial advisor Ric Edelman is challenging traditional portfolio guidance, asking advisors to recommend crypto allocations as high as 40%. Key Takeaways: Ric Edelman now recommends crypto allocations of up to 40%, a shift from his 1% guidance. He says Bitcoin’s mainstream adoption has resolved past uncertainties. Crypto’s uncorrelated performance can boost diversification. “Today I am saying 40%, that’s astonishing,” Edelman told CNBC’s Crypto World this week. “No one has ever said such a thing.” In his 2021 book The Truth About Crypto , Edelman suggested allocations as low as 1% were appropriate, reflecting the uncertainties that clouded the market just a few years ago. Edelman: Crypto’s Rise Justifies 40% Allocation Edelman, who leads the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, said the dramatic change stems from what he described as the industry’s transformation. “Four years ago, we didn’t know if governments would ban Bitcoin, if the technology would fail, or if institutions would adopt it,” he said. “Today, all those questions have been resolved. It’s radically changed and is now a mainstream asset.” Signs of crypto’s mainstream arrival are evident in the surge of inflows into spot bitcoin ETFs, which have pulled in billions this year and are among the top-performing asset classes for new investments. The influx has put crypto firmly on the radar of advisors and institutional investors. Edelman also highlighted a broader trend reshaping investment strategy: the erosion of the traditional 60/40 portfolio split between stocks and bonds. Longer life expectancies, with projections suggesting people could live to 100 in coming decades, mean that retirees will need higher returns for longer periods. “Today’s 60-year-old is kind of like yesterday’s 30-year-old,” he said. “You need to get better returns than you can get from bonds and you need to hold equities longer than ever before.” In this environment, Edelman argued, crypto’s role becomes indispensable. He pointed out that Bitcoin’s price movements are uncorrelated with traditional assets, making it a powerful diversification tool that can enhance portfolio risk-adjusted returns. “The crypto asset class offers the opportunity for higher returns than you’re likely to get in virtually any other asset class,” he said. Edelman Calls Bitcoin Price Forecasts Conservative With some market watchers forecasting bitcoin prices could reach $150,000-$250,000 by year-end — and even $500,000 by the end of the decade — Edelman called these projections “conservative” compared to other bullish estimates. As reported, Shunyet Jan, Head of Derivatives at Bybit, has projected that Bitcoin could reach $125,000 by the end of Q2 if current trends persist. Likewise, crypto analyst Scott Melker has said he believes Bitcoin could surge to $250,000 by the end of 2025 , driven by institutional demand and a maturing market structure. Despite growing interest in Bitcoin, not everyone in traditional finance is convinced of its long-term staying power. As reported, Eric Semler, chairman of Semler Scientific, has said that many hedge funds remain skeptical about Bitcoin’s long-term viability, believing it may lose momentum after the Trump administration.

The latest acquisition has pushed its total holdings to 13,350 BTC, surpassing CleanSpark to become the fifth-largest publicly traded corporate holder of Bitcoin. Metaplanet Expands Bitcoin Stash In a statement, the company’s CEO, Simon Gerovich, disclosed it paid an average of around $107,601 per BTC in its latest purchase, with the total stash currently valued near $1.45 billion at current market rates. The acquisition aligns with Metaplanet’s accelerated Bitcoin accumulation strategy, which was revised earlier this year with ambitions to amass over 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027. The exec also added, “Just 3 months ago, we announced live at our shareholder meeting that we hit 3,350 BTC – and now we’ve added 10,000 more to reach 13,350 BTC.” The firm’s Bitcoin purchase was financed in part through the issuance of ¥30 billion ($208 million) in zero-coupon, non-interest-bearing bonds, which is scheduled to mature in December 2025, which aligns with its ongoing approach to using debt and equity channels to fund BTC buys while simultaneously conducting bond buybacks to optimize its capital structure. According to its disclosures, the company said that it aims to maintain a shareholder-aligned approach by tracking a proprietary BTC yield metric, measuring Bitcoin per fully diluted share, which has sharply increased following the latest purchase. The company has logged a quarter-to-date BTC yield of over 129%. Metaplanet’s shares responded positively to the development. It rose nearly 10% on the day of the announcement in Tokyo, and continued a rally that has seen its stock climb over 350% year-to-date. Climbing Corporate Bitcoin Leaderboard According to the leaderboard updated by BitcoinTreasuries, Metaplanet is currently trailing behind Strategy, Marathon Digital, Twenty One Capital, and Riot Platforms, which currently hold 592,345 BTC, 49,179 BTC, 37,229.7 BTC, and 19,225 BTC, respectively.

2025-06-30T07:09:31,"Good News for BTC? US Dollar Weakness Accelerates as Experts Predict Bitcoin Parabolic Move","The US dollar index, DXY, “has entered a free-fall mode,” observed Ted Labs co-founder Niels on X on June 29. The index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of currencies, has declined 11% so far this year, which is its “worst performance in 40 years,” he added. He also said that the US government is planning to devalue it even more by raising the debt limit by $5 trillion. “Buy and HODL hard assets like BTC as they are about to go parabolic.” DXY Declines Accelerate The DXY is currently just above 97, its lowest level since February 2022, when much of the world was still gripped by pandemic-induced lockdowns. The recent multi-year low came amid rising odds of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve. The CME FedWatch Tool now shows a 19% chance of a 25-basis-point cut at the July 30 meeting. The index has slumped almost 12% since January, when it was a little over 110. President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs, conflict in the Middle East, and increasing M2 money supply through central bank printing have significantly devalued the dollar. “The more money they print, the higher asset prices go,” said Bitcoin pioneer Anthony Pompliano on Sunday. “They can’t stop printing money, so asset prices can’t stop going up over the long run. The only major financial sin you can commit is saving in dollars or bonds. Both get devalued away.” The entrepreneur has launched his own Bitcoin treasury company, joining the ranks of corporations that are accumulating the asset for strategic reserves amid growing concern about fiat currency devaluation. Earlier this month, Director of Global Macro at Fidelity, Jurrien Timmer, said “the price action in the dollar and bonds tells the story of a potentially changing global regime,” before assing that gold and other currencies are replacing the USD and Treasurys as the safe haven. Good News For Bitcoin Bitcoin has traditionally performed well when the dollar has weakened. DXY fell almost 15% in 2017 and into early 2018, coinciding with a massive crypto bull market and a new Bitcoin all-time high. The index also tanked around 13% from March 2020 to mid-2021, which was around the same time that Bitcoin and crypto surged to all-time highs again in late 2021. DXY falling almost 12% so far in 2025 could be one of the catalysts that precedes the 2025 bull market surge later this year, which would be right on time in the four-year cycle.

By the end of H1, the company already surpassed its goal of acquiring 10,000 BTC for the entire year. Metaplanet acquired another 1,005 BTC, with its total holdings reaching 13,350 BTC. The Japanese company hit its stride with four rounds of purchases in June, now ranking seventh among top corporate treasuries. Recently, Metaplanet surpassed Tesla’s treasury , which is passive and has not seen new inflows for months. *Metaplanet Acquires Additional 1,005 $BTC , Total Holdings Reach 13,350 BTC* pic.twitter.com/a6aNMV9weD — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) June 30, 2025 Following the latest purchase at $107,923 per BTC, Metaplanet achieved an average price of $96,121 per BTC, expected to rise if purchases continue. Following the latest announcement, the company’s stock (MTPLF) retained its valuation near its all-time high, rising by another 9.87% in the past day. MTPLF traded at 1,640 JPY ($11.39), down from recent valuations above $13. As a result of the accelerated BTC purchases and price growth, Metaplanet created pressure for its short sellers. Citigroup Global shorted Metaplanet in the $3-$4 range, just before the biggest streak of BTC purchases. Metaplanet’s founder Simon Gerovich added to the trend with a bullish social media message , with a promise of more BTC purchases coming in the near future. In the past month, Metaplanet’s shares stalled, despite the more regular purchases. The firm’s new BTC additions started to resemble the schedule of Strategy (MSTR), often happening on the same day as Strategy’s purchases. Metaplanet buys back previous bond issues While financing additional BTC purchases, Metaplanet also aims to control its debt and improve its balance sheet. Along with the latest BTC addition, Metaplanet issued Series 19 of its ordinary bonds, aiming to cancel an earlier Series 3 guaranteed bonds. The latest bond series is for $21M, with a redemption date on December 29, 2025. The bond series is fully subscribed by one single buyer, Evo Fund. Evo Fund is at the basis of Metaplanet’s approach to financing, recently agreeing to redeem an older bond series for the unsecured New Bonds. | Source: Cryptorank . Evo Fund is a tier-4 venture capital firm, which specifically deals with portfolio management and has already supported Metaplanet on four occasions. The fund has only operated in Japan , but has an unannounced jurisdiction. Metaplanet previously raised 1.7B JPY ($12.1M) through the Series 3 bonds for earlier BTC acquisitions. After a board meeting and discussions with the Bondholder Evo Fund, the company has agreed to refinance the previous bond series. The former obligation was interest-bearing and secured by collateral, while the New Bonds are non-interest bearing and unsecured. Evo Fund has also financed Metaplanet through several rounds of stock acquisition rights. The fund has a 555M share program, potentially giving Metaplanet up to $5.5B for more BTC acquisitions. By the end of the year, Metaplanet may become the second-biggest BTC holder, with predictions for a treasury at above 63,000 BTC. The stock price may continue to rise, depending on the various bullish scenarios for BTC. For now, Evo Fund is yet to exercise stock purchasing options, greatly expanding the purchasing power of Metaplanet. Following the latest announcement, BTC staged an early-week rally, re-sparking hopes for another all-time peak. BTC rose to $108,268, with additional news of corporate purchases expected later today.

2025-06-30T07:04:36,"Crypto Analyst Sees Bitcoin Treasury Companies Igniting BTC Rallies to $150,000 or Higher – Unless This Happens","A widely followed crypto analyst says that Bitcoin ( BTC ) treasury firms could push the crypto king to a $150,000 price tag, possibly even higher. In a new strategy session , pseudonymous crypto trader DonAlt – one of the hosts of the TechnicalRoundup YouTube channel – tells his 67,000 subscribers that he believes BTC will eventually break out of its sideways trading range between $100,000 and $110,000. When asked about the “David versus Goliath” battle between Bitcoin corporations accumulating and old-school BTC investors unloading, DonAlt says that the demand side would eventually prevail, unless something changes in the macroeconomic picture. “I think the buyers are probably going to win. Whenever you get these movements…if something drastically changes on the macro side of things, you’re going to have to adapt to that pretty quickly. But unless something drastically changes, I think the buyers are just going to take control… Even if they’re going to lose, they’re going to be in profit for a little bit, which basically means I think there’s a really good chance we’re going to break above $110,000 and then maybe run to like $140,000 or $150,000 – something in that range. And then if it’s bearish, it’s going to nuke catastrophically from there, and if it’s not bearish, maybe go even higher. But I’d be very, very shocked if this new trend doesn’t lead to us breaking out.” Bitcoin treasury companies are publicly traded or private companies that hold BTC on their balance sheets as part of their treasury reserve strategy Some of the top BTC Treasury firms in the world include Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, health tech firm Semler Scientific and electric car manufacturer Tesla.

2025-06-30T07:03:14,"BTC drops below $101K after US claims airstrike in Iran, MUTM offers stability","As geopolitical tensions flare and Bitcoin (BTC) slips below $101,000 following reports of a US airstrike in Iran, major crypto investors are scrambling to reposition. While BTC dominance wavers, it is in talks that the top whales are now actively exploring safer, high-upside havens—and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a top choice. Priced at just $0.03 in Phase 5 of its presale, with over 50% of tokens already sold, MUTM offers both stability and explosive potential. In the last 10 days, over $850,000 in whale capital has quietly shifted into Mutuum, drawn by its $0.06 guaranteed presale ceiling, real DeFi utility, and beta platform going live at listing. If MUTM hits even $1.20 post-launch, as analysts project, today’s entry could yield a 40x return. That means a $5,000 buy-in today could be worth $200,000 in a matter of months. Early Phase 1 investors have already seen 3x gains, and with the price about to rise to $0.035 in Phase 6, this is likely the final chance to lock in early-stage returns. What is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Unlike speculative tokens that rely on hype cycles, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will offer a hybrid lending model that directly monetizes market movement. The platform is being developed with two complementary systems: peer-to-contract (P2C) for blue-chip and stable assets, and peer-to-peer (P2P) for riskier tokens. While BTC holders are currently watching their portfolio value decline, future Mutuum users will be able to lend BTC into a shared liquidity pool and earn interest as borrowers tap into the pool’s depth—allowing holders to retain long-term exposure while generating yield. In the P2C model, interest rates will automatically adjust based on pool usage. This means that during high-volatility periods like the current geopolitical unrest, borrowing demand is expected to increase, which would raise returns for lenders. Meanwhile, the P2P structure will give more aggressive participants the freedom to negotiate their own terms on less liquid assets—effectively turning volatility into earning opportunity. Rather than being victims of the market’s swings, MUTM participants will be positioned to benefit from them. mtTokens, the platform’s yield-bearing assets, will be central to this structure. Depositors into either lending model will receive mtTokens representing their share of the pool, which will accumulate value based on usage and interest generation. These tokens will be fully transferable ERC-20 compliant assets, meaning they can be traded, staked, or used as collateral within the ecosystem. For those seeking passive income, staking mtTokens in designated contracts will open access to dividends from the protocol’s buyback mechanism—where revenue is used to purchase and redistribute MUTM tokens. De-risked infrastructure built for unstable markets What separates Mutuum Finance (MUTM) from other DeFi projects launching during uncertain times is its rigorous technical and security foundation. The platform has undergone a full audit by CertiK, one of the most respected blockchain security firms. The audit included both manual review and static analysis, resulting in a Skynet Score of 77 and a Token Scan Score of 95. With a public bug bounty also in place, the development team is signaling a clear commitment to security before going live. Another layer of resilience comes from its Layer-2 integration. Rather than being burdened by Ethereum (ETH)’s high fees and slow transaction speeds, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being optimized to run on scalable Layer-2 infrastructure—allowing for faster, cheaper interactions across lending, borrowing, and staking operations. For users seeking yield during periods of high on-chain activity, this will prove essential. Capital flows often shift away from congested platforms when fear enters the market, and MUTM is preparing to catch that flow. The stablecoin mechanics further add predictability. Users will be able to borrow a decentralized stablecoin minted only when overcollateralized. As loans are repaid or liquidated, the stablecoin will be burned—ensuring a tightly managed supply. The interest rate will be governed by protocol parameters aimed at maintaining the $1 peg, with built-in arbitrage incentives helping stabilize any temporary price shifts. While BTC price fluctuates, the value backing MUTM’s lending systems will be rooted in structured logic and transparent governance. Currently priced at $0.03, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already raised over $11.3 million with support from more than 12,600 holders. The momentum has grown organically, supported in part by a $100,000 giveaway that will reward ten early believers with $10,000 worth in MUTM tokens. But perhaps the most important element ahead is the Phase 3 beta launch. The platform’s beta is scheduled to go live at the time of listing, giving participants direct access to its utility on day one. This structure flips the traditional model—starting with function instead of hype. The full token supply stands at 4 billion, and with a fixed presale price during this phase, investors are locking in positions before wider market attention floods in. As Bitcoin (BTC) struggles with external pressure, the focus is shifting to protocols that aren’t built on sentiment but on sustainable mechanics. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is structured for function and designed for scale—and for those entering now, it’s still early. Fear often distorts value, but it also creates opportunity. While BTC rocks, MUTM builds. The window to secure exposure at $0.03 is narrowing—and when the beta goes live, early capital will be the first to benefit from a system built for long-term earnings, regardless of the headlines.

2025-06-30T07:01:17,"Is XRP ETF Coming in July?","The post Is XRP ETF Coming in July? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The XRP community is buzzing after Ripple confirmed it’s officially ending its cross-appeal in the lawsuit with the U.S. SEC. Since both the parties have dropped their appeals, and Ripple has agreed to a $50 million settlement , significantly lower than the previously proposed $125 million. With this resolution, the court has also lifted restrictions on Ripple’s institutional sales of XRP, paving the way for expanded business opportunities. This signals the close of a major chapter in crypto history, potentially clearing the way for a spot XRP ETF. Moreover, it has increased hopes that the SEC will follow suit and fully close the case, removing one of the biggest hurdles standing in XRP’s path. AI Agent Flags July for XRP ETF Filing Top AI analyst AIXBT has predicted that ETF filings for XRP could arrive as soon as July. According to the AI, XRP now enjoys full regulatory clarity, something no other major crypto token has. This claim has fueled excitement, especially as it echoes recent views shared by ETF Store President Nate Geraci. Geraci believes the end of the legal fight sets the stage for asset managers like BlackRock to get involved with XRP . Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart believes that if new XRP ETFs pull in over $85 million in their first week, it would be seen as a success, given that XRP’s spot market is about 7.5% the size of Bitcoin’s. For comparison, Bitcoin ETFs saw $14 billion in volume and over $1 billion in flows at launch. Though there is no fixed timeline yet, the SEC is expected to make decisions by late 2025, with big names like Grayscale, VanEck, Bitwise, and Canary Capital in the mix. [post_titles_links postid=”476671″] XRP Price Pump XRP saw a nearly 5% price jump after Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed they were “closing this chapter once and for all.” The sentiment was quickly picked up by the AI, which described XRP as having the cleanest regulatory status in the crypto space, further bolstering investor confidence. Despite the optimism, AIXBT issued a word of caution. It warned that traders may be getting too comfortable with long positions, hinting at possible near-term volatility. The AI suggested that while the long-term path for XRP looks clearer, short-term corrections could occur as traders rush in too early. All eyes are now on July. If an XRP ETF filing materializes, and especially if BlackRock is involved, XRP could make the leap from a regulatory underdog to a mainstream financial product. For now, the clock is ticking, and excitement is mounting. [article_inside_subscriber_shortcode title=”Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!” description=”Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more.” category_name=”News” category_id=”6″] FAQs Why did XRP’s price jump after the settlement announcement, and is this momentum likely to continue? XRP’s price jumped by nearly 5% because the settlement provides crucial regulatory clarity, removing a major legal overhang. This increased investor confidence and opens the door for institutional adoption and an XRP ETF, suggesting continued long-term momentum, though short-term volatility is possible. How might the launch of an XRP ETF affect XRP’s price, liquidity, and mainstream adoption? An XRP ETF would significantly boost XRP’s price by allowing institutional capital to flow in. It would enhance liquidity by providing a familiar, regulated investment vehicle, and dramatically accelerate mainstream adoption by making XRP accessible to a wider range of traditional investors. How might expanded institutional involvement (via ETFs and direct sales) reshape the XRP ecosystem? Expanded institutional involvement will reshape the XRP ecosystem by increasing capital inflows, driving demand for Ripple’s enterprise solutions, and fostering greater real-world utility for XRP in cross-border payments. This will enhance liquidity, stability, and potentially lead to more widespread adoption of the XRP Ledger.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/is-xrp-etf-coming-in-july/,"XRP|REGULATION|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","News|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

According to a translated press release , on June 29, shareholders of Vanadi Coffee approved the company’s change in strategy to acquire more Bitcoin ( BTC ) on its balance sheet. The publicly-listed chain that currently operates six cafes based only in Alicante, now aims to become the largest Spanish company with a Bitcoin treasury.

2025-06-30T06:53:52,"Last Time Bitcoin’s Price Did This XRP Skyrocketed 518% in 77 Days","With a $129 billion market cap to Bitcoin’s $2.1 trillion, XRP is about 6% the leading crypto’s weight by capitalization. By comparison, Ethereum held around 14% of Bitcoin’s market cap in June. The most bullish Ethereum and Ripple investors both see the potential in the ETH and XRP platforms to be as disruptive as Bitcoin and see future adoption on a similar scale. Ethereum bulls are focused on how its smart contract services could disrupt the massive and lucrative finance, insurance, and legal sectors. Meanwhile, the XRP army is focused on the vast opportunity for Ripple’s international payments services. In addition to Ripple’s very advanced business along the lines of global payments for big institutions, its XRP Ledger is finding more uses for XRP in decentralized finance. Here are four bullish signs that XRP’s price could be poised for another god candle sometime in 2025. 1. XRP vs. BTC in July Compared XRP has a substantially smaller market cap than Bitcoin. Crypto investors also view it as a more speculative risk-reward proposition. As a result, when Bitcoin prices go up or down, XRP’s price can move in the same direction, but with higher percentages of gains and losses. Expert Bitcoin analysts expect another big showing from the leading crypto in Q3 or Q4 of this year, like the rally from Nov. through Jan last year. Long-time futures trader and long-term Bitcoin bull Peter Brandt is calling for another 50% leg up for BTC by Aug. or Sept. Meanwhile, $200,000 BTC in 2025 and $500,000 by 2028 are in line with analyst expectations from Standard Chartered, Galaxy Digital, Ark Invest, and others. If XRP prices follow the same trend as the last rally and melt up the chart 10x faster than BTC, then the Ripple holders could see +500% gains in the event of $150,000 Bitcoin and +1,000% ROI in a matter of months in the event of $200,000 BTC. Now, no two markets are exactly the same, and previous results do not guarantee future performance. But by the same token, as Wall Street has long known— winners tend to win again, and big winners tend to win big again. So the question is does Ripple continue to have the same competitive advantages going into July that attracted such a higher percentage capital gain from crypto investors from Nov. to Jan? 2. SEC vs. Ripple Lawsuit Update Is the SEC lawsuit against Ripple Labs first filed in Dec. 2020 still ongoing? You could say so, but it has taken an almost comically bullish turn for Ripple and XRP yet again. The Southern District of New York’s Judge Analisa Torres came to Ripple’s rescue with a July 2023 ruling siding with the company against the SEC (at least partially). Torres ruled that XRP tokens did not meet the definition of unregistered securities, when it comes to their programatic sales on exchanges. But under the new Trump Administration, the SEC is now so crypto friendly, that in June Judge Torres rejected a sweetheart joint motion by the SEC and Ripple asking to cut its fine from $125 million to $50 million. Furthermore, the joint motion asked the court to remove its previously laid permanent injunction upon Ripple Labs not to violate any Act of Congress. The court denied the motion and the judge chastised the counter parties in the case for trying to over-step their authority. Markets can now see a difference plain as night and day between the Gensler SEC and the Atkins SEC that removes a massive source of long-term resistance to XRP price growth. Instead of prosecuting Ripple so over zealously that a federal judge ruled against the main argument in their case, the SEC is now getting blocked by the same judge for being too friendly. Meanwhile, XRP ETF applications are stacking up at the Securities and Exchange Commission as Wall Street demand for Ripple exposure grows. 3. XRP Ledger, Wormhole Lock In More Multi-chain XRP’s use case as a fast, reliable, low-fee international payments rail over RippleNet is it’s flagship operation. But the development of smart contract issuance on XRP Ledger is a massive opportunity for growth. A mid-June update from Ripple Labs highlighted some serious progress on XRPL. “A wave of new fiat-backed stablecoins are now live on the XRP Ledger including USDC, XSGD, EURØP, RLUSD, and USDB,” Ripple Labs noted in a blog update on 6/12. “The XRPL’s native digital asset XRP retains a pivotal role, supporting stablecoin use cases by enabling efficient liquidity between assets, powering fast settlement, and serving as a bridge in cross-currency transactions.” -Ripple Labs More recently, Ripple announced on 6/26, that it is partnering with the multi-chain platform Wormhole so XRPL network peers can use XRP on over 200 blockchain apps across +35 different cryptocurrency platforms. When Could Ripple Realistically Take Enough SWIFT Market Share At the XRP APEX 2025 conference in Singapore this June, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said XRP could capture 14% of SWIFT global payments volume in five years: “There are two parts to SWIFT today: messaging and liquidity. Liquidity is owned by the banks. I think less about the messaging and more about liquidity. If you’re driving all the liquidity, it is good for XRP… so I’ll say five years, 14%.” Popular YouTube podcaster and life insurance and financial services salesman Patrick Bet-David keeps stirring the pot with the claim that this could push XRP’s price to $1,000. How could Ripple take so much market share from SWIFT? The math is simple. SWIFT takes 1 – 5 business days to clear a transaction. RippleNet takes about five seconds. Meanwhile, SWIFT costs around $50 per transfer. Ripple costs about a tenth of a penny.

According to its June 30 public disclosure , the company spent ¥15.648 billion, about $108 million, on the latest purchase. It paid an average of 15,569,831 yen, approximately $107,430, per Bitcoin ( BTC ). This brings Metaplanet’s total holdings to 13,350 BTC, acquired at an average price of 14,331,959 yen, roughly $98,891, per coin. To fund further accumulation, Metaplanet also announced the issuance of its 19th series of ordinary bonds to EVO FUND. The new bonds, worth 30 billion yen, or $207 million, carry no interest and mature in December 2025. This capital will be partly used to buy more Bitcoin and partly to refinance 1.75 billion yen in existing secured debt from its third bond series issued in November 2024.

The last time that this altcoin made headlines was back in 2023, which was a halving year. Since then, it has trended below the $100 level as the crypto market has struggled to hold up gains. Now, once again, the altcoin may be gearing up for another major move as it is close to completing a rare Golden Cross formation . Litecoin Golden Cross Formation Is On The Horizon Golden Cross formations for Litecoin have been rare despite having been in the market for over a decade. There have only been two Golden Cross formations in the history of the cryptocurrency, meaning that this occurrence of this formation carries significant implications for the price. The Golden Cross formation happens when the 50-Week and the 200-Week moving averages cross each other, beckoning the return of the bulls. Crypto analyst and CMT-certified expert Tony “The Bull” Severino pointed out the importance of this formation. He highlighted that another Golden Cross is about to form for Litecoin and used the performance of the previous formations to show what could happen ahead of this cross. The first time that this Golden Cross appeared was back in 2017, and the crypto analyst revealed that the Litecoin price had seen a 700% increase ahead of the cross. Then again, in 2021, there was another Golden Cross of the 50-Week and 200-Week moving averages, which saw a 450% rally. However, something worthy of note is the fact that the Litecoin price rallies have always happened before the Golden Cross formation was complete. Given this trend, it is possible that Litecoin is on the cusp of another major price rally before the formation is complete. There also seems to have been some diminishing returns in how much the Litecoin price has rallied in response. Therefore, it is possible that the current rally may not be as high as the previous ones, but could still see an over 200% increase regardless. Besides, the analyst points out that a sizable rally would trigger the Golden Cross. Currently, the Litecoin price is still trading at around $87 at the time of writing. So, a 200% rally would put the altcoin’s price above the $200 mark. If it does follow the return patterns of the previous appearances of the Golden Cross, then a 450% rally would put it above $300, and a 700% rally would set it on a path to $500.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/litecoin-3rd-ever-golden-cross/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","Litecoin|Crypto Crypto news|litecoin|Litecoin Halving|litecoin news|Litecoin price|LTC|LTC news|LTC price|ltcusd|LTCUSDT",cryptocompare

Cantor said the newly launched Bitcoin Financing Business is expected to provide up to $2 billion in financing during its initial rollout. The size of Wintermute’s deal with the investment bank was not disclosed. The lending and borrowing of crypto was taking place on an industrial scale several years back, but many of the firms involved either incurred heavy losses or were forced into bankruptcy as contagion spread through the industry. But Cantor’s debut perhaps signals a new and more institution-friendly phase. Wintermute is currently expanding its presence in the U.S., where a groundswell of movement is happening in crypto trading under Donald Trump’s pro-innovation administration. Institutional demand for digital assets such as bitcoin, stablecoins, and select high beta altcoins continues to accelerate, driven by catalysts such as ETF developments and shifts in interest rate environments, said Wintermute CEO Evgeny Gaevoy. “Given the capital intensive nature of our operations, especially OTC trading, which involves managing settlement windows and maintaining capital across multiple venues, the facility enhances our ability to hedge risks effectively across exchanges and maintain broad market coverage,” Gaevoy said in an email.

2025-06-30T06:01:00,"Crypto market rally: Here’s why Bitcoin, altcoins are going up","The crypto market rally restarted on Monday, with Bitcoin price rising to the important resistance level at $108,000, and the market capitalization of all tokens jumped to over $3.3 trillion. Most altcoins were in the green on Monday too, with the most notable gainers being Launch Coin on Believe, Useless Coin, Arbitrum , Pudgy Penguins, and Pyth Network , which jumped by over 10%. So, why are Bitcoin and altcoins rising? Crypto market rally | Source: CoinMarket Cap Crypto market rally continues amid the US dollar index crash The crypto market rally has surged in the past few days as the US dollar index (DXY) plunged. For example, the DXY Index plunged to a low of $97.13, its lowest point since 2022 and 11.85% below the highest point this year. The US dollar index has more downside to go, as we wrote here . Morgan Stanley analysts believe that it may crash to $90 in the coming months. It has also formed a death cross as the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) crossed each other. A death cross is one of the most bearish patterns in technical analysis. The index has also moved below the important support level at $97.91, its lowest swing on April 21, and invalidating the bullish double-bottom pattern. Crypto prices often perform well when the US dollar is falling, as most of them are priced in the currency. Also, the falling greenback is a sign that investors anticipate that the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates soon. Big Beautiful Bill progress in Congress The other top reason why Bitcoin and other altcoins are going up is that the Senate made progress on Donald Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill. It passed the initial stage, and there are signs that it will pass in Congress. Polymarket data shows that odds of the reconciliation bill passing by July 4th jumped to 70%. Another poll with $140,000 in assets has a 75% chance. This bill will include features that directly benefit the cryptocurrency market. For example, it will include major tax cuts, such as those on overtime pay, tips, and social security. Some of the savings will move to the crypto industry. The bill will also benefit Bitcoin because it will reduce the case for buying the US dollar by expanding the public debt. Estimates are that the bill will lead to substantial deficit growth over time. Bitcoin is widely seen as a hedge against rising geopolitical risks because of its supply cap of 21 million coins. Rising crypto ETF demand The crypto market is also rising as investors focus on the rising ETF demand. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have added nearly $50 billion in inflows since their inception in January last year. Similarly, Ethereum ETFs have had a substantial increase in inflows in the past few months. They added over $283 million in assets last week, a big increase from $40.2 million in the prior week. The total inflows in June exceeded $1.1 billion. The rising Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF demand is happening at a time when their supply in exchanges are falling. Recent data shows that the supply of Bitcoin in exchanges has plunged to the lowest level since 2017. Bitcoin price breakout hopes BTC price chart | Source: TradingView The crypto market is also rising as bulls wait for the upcoming Bitcoin price breakout. BTC has formed a cup-and-handle pattern and a bullish flag, indicating a potential rebound to a new all-time high. Such a strong Bitcoin price rebound will likely lead to more gains over time.

2025-06-30T05:45:43,"Bhutan Bets on Binance Pay to Power Crypto-Backed Tourism Economy","Bhutan is going full tilt on crypto — not just to modernize its financial rails, but to attract high-value global travelers and build a digitally resilient economy. At the Digital Bhutan panel, co-hosted by Binance, officials laid out a clear vision: bring crypto out of theory and into everyday life. “Tourists complain they can’t use SWIFT or pay easily. Binance Pay fixes that,” said Damcho Rinzin, director of the department of tourism. Rinzin added that travelers are already using crypto to buy local goods — in one case, even groceries to cook their own meals. Bhutan’s ambitions remain modest, just 300,000 visitors a year. But it wants them to stay longer and spend more — with Binance Pay’s 40 million plus user base as a lever. Binance CEO Richard Teng framed it as a shift from speculation to infrastructure. “This is the first national crypto payments system,” Teng said. “The average crypto tourist spends $1,000 — nearly three times a regular tourist — and merchants receive instant settlements,” he added. With over 1,000 merchants onboarded, and zero fees on Binance Pay compared to steep charges from other providers, Bhutan hopes to build a community-driven, tech-savvy ecosystem that aligns with its values. DK Bank, which played a pioneering role in Bhutan’s early bitcoin mining efforts, is now spearheading crypto adoption on the ground. “Mobile and QR payments are already high,” said the bank’s CEO, Ugyen Tenzin said. “Crypto just fits,"" he added. ""And this is just the start,"" said Hobeng Lim, managing director of finance at Gelephu Mindfulness City. Gelephu Mindfulness City is a planned city in the country which merges technology, like blockchain, with culture, and sustainability., Lim added that they are many more blockchain-native projects in the pipeline, with digital assets formally recognized as a future growth engine. “Crypto is not a side experiment, It’s a core industry,” Lim said.

2025-06-30T05:30:59,"Top Analyst Predicts Major Ethereum Rally Toward $4,000 As Shorts Hit All-Time Highs","As the market’s second largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum (ETH), struggles to maintain momentum above the crucial $2,500 threshold, one analyst believes that ETH is poised for a significant rally. In a recent post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), crypto analyst Cyclop expressed a bullish outlook, labeling the current market conditions as the best long setup for Ethereum he has seen in years. Analyst Sees $4,000 Target This Summer Cyclop highlighted that Ethereum short positions have reached all-time highs, a situation reminiscent of a previous spike that occurred just weeks ago. The analyst noted that liquidity has been swept on both sides, creating a scenario where market uncertainty may actually benefit Ethereum. “Most doubt ETH and altcoins right now—I’m betting on $4,000 this summer,” he stated confidently. Related Reading: TD Sequential Flashes Buy: Dogecoin Ready For Rebound To $0.21 Cyclop outlined several key factors driving his optimistic stance. First, he pointed to the recent Pectra update, which has reinvigorated interest in Ethereum by enhancing transaction capabilities, updating security features, and improving staking options. This update has reportedly led to increased demand, contributing to a potential price surge. Moreover, Cyclop emphasized the broader macroeconomic landscape, noting that cryptocurrency adoption is accelerating beyond Bitcoin (BTC), with Ethereum taking a prominent role. The analyst suggests that major corporations and banks are beginning to purchase and stake Ethereum, further boosting trust and interest in the digital asset which could ultimately result in more demand and more price uptrends. Ethereum Rallies May Trigger Altcoin Boom On-chain metrics also favor Ethereum, with the cryptocurrency ranking highly in various categories, according to Cyclop. It currently stands as the second-highest by fees, leads in bridged net flows, and ranks third in stablecoin supply changes, showcasing its robust market position. Another critical aspect of Cyclop’s analysis concerns altcoins and the upcoming altseason, traditionally characterized by a rush of investment into Ethereum before spilling over into smaller tokens. He pointed out that historical patterns indicate that Ethereum price rallies often trigger broader altcoin surges, and the current market sentiment suggests that many altcoins are at their lowest ebb. Related Reading: Dogecoin Silent Build-Up: Double Bottom Hints At Explosive Move To $0.47 While Cyclop acknowledges that a majority of altcoins may face significant challenges, he argues that ETH remains undervalued, especially with Bitcoin trading near $100,000. He has made strategic moves, reallocating some of his Bitcoin holdings into Ethereum and promising strong altcoins. His initial target for Ethereum is $3,000, where he plans to take profits, followed by a series of sell orders between $4,000 and $6,000. As of press time, ETH trades at $2,500, a 12% price increase in the weekly time frame.

2025-06-30T05:30:58,"3 Things That Could Impact Bitcoin and Crypto Markets in Week Ahead","US stock markets surged last week, with major indexes approaching all-time highs on the easing of tensions in the Middle East and rising hopes for a Federal Reserve rate cut later this year. Crypto markets were a little slower to react, remaining mostly flat over the past week and into the weekend. The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, core PCE, showed that price increases accelerated in May, raising inflation concerns. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last week that he expects to see a pickup in inflation this summer, but reiterated his “wait and see” approach. On Sunday, President Trump commented on the July 9 deadline for the 90-day tariff pause, stating, “I don’t think I need to extend it, but could.” Economic Events June 30 to July 4 June’s ISM Manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI) is due on Tuesday. This report shows business conditions in the manufacturing sector and serves as a significant leading indicator of overall economic conditions. There are also job openings data due on Tuesday, which could reflect conditions in the labor market. Wednesday and Thursday will see more labor market reports, with nonfarm payrolls and unemployment figures released. These reports represent the number of new jobs created during the previous month, along with the percentage of people actively seeking employment. They are significant economic indicators, as the shift in the number of jobs is strongly associated with overall economic health. June’s ISM Services PMI, due on Thursday, will reflect business conditions in the services sector and is another leading economic indicator. Traditional markets are closed on Friday for the July 4 celebrations as we enter the second half of the year. Crypto Market Outlook Digital asset markets remained flat over the weekend but gained during early Asian trading on Monday morning to reach $3.46 trillion in total capitalization. Bitcoin has reached a two-week high, tapping $108,750 in early trading on Monday, but it faced resistance there yet again and fell back to $108,500 at the time of writing. The assed has struggled at this level at least five times over the past week where it has been rejected. Ethereum is doing a little better, having reached its support-turned-resistance level of $2,500 on Monday morning after a 2.8% gain. The altcoins were mostly in the green with minor gains, but Hyperliquid (HYPE) was leading the pack, adding 7.5% on the day to top $40.

2025-06-30T05:30:40,"BNB Chain rolls out Maxwell hardfork to reduce block time and enhance network responsiveness","Cryptocurrencies displayed strength over the weekend as Bitcoin extended above $105,000 to press time’s $108,568. While altcoins brace for significant bounce-backs, BNB Chain will officially roll out the Maxwell hardfork today, June 30, 2025. The upgrade aims to enrich Binance’s chain through enhanced efficiency and speed. BNB Chain @BNBCHAIN · Follow ⚠️ Maxwell Hardfork goes live in a few hours, here’s everything you need to know 🧵 👇 8:24 PM · Jun 29, 2025 130 Reply Copy link Read 56 replies First and foremost, Maxwell will halve BSC’s block time to only 0.75 seconds from 1.5 seconds, making it a sub-second platform. It’s noteworthy that today’s fork builds on last year’s Lorentz upgrade momentum, reflecting the team’s continued dedication to scalability, speed, and enriched user experience. BSC’s journey to efficiency: from Loretz upgrade to Maxwell BNB Chain is among the blockchain projects that take speed as a foundational element for success in the sector. It rolled out the Lorentz fork in April 2025 to reduce block times from 3 seconds to 1.5 seconds. The update brought noticeable enhancement across validator efficiency, dApp responsiveness, and DeFi performance. BNB Chain flourished after Lorentz. For instance, it delivered only a $0.04 transaction fee. Moreover, Dune’s data shows BSC outshined all decentralized exchanges (DEXs) in daily volume. Source – Dune Analytics Meanwhile, the Maxwell upgrade will take these advancements to another level. Node operators, developers, and users can anticipate smooth app interactions and swift transaction confirmations. What to expect with Maxwell hardfork? The latest upgrade transforms BNB Smart Chain’s ecosystem with three main improvements. Firstly, it introduces BEP-524 to slash the block interval to 0.75 seconds. That means doubling BSC’s transaction throughput capability. Users will enjoy accelerated offerings from minting and token swaps to smart contract execution and GameFi activities. Secondly, Maxwell enhanced validator messaging by enhancing existing p2p communication models. That will reduce possible syncing lags, boosting network stability even during faster activities. Validators will experience fewer delays when proposing and voting on blocks. Finally, the BPE-564 standard introduces two messaging mechanisms, GetBlocksByRangeMsg and RangeBlocksMsg. These will enable nodes to synch massive block groups at once, enriching syncing speed and reliability across the BSC network. The Maxwell update isn’t about boosting speed alone. It represents a strategic step toward a more efficient and faster blockchain future. The upgrade reflects BSC’s dedication to dominating web3 adoption amid renewed demand for responsive performance in NFTs, DeFi, and online gaming. BNB price outlook The native token displayed bullishness as enthusiasts brace for network enhancements. BNB trades at $655 after rebounding from the support at $642. Chart by Coinamrketcap Its increasing daily trading volume suggests a possible upward continuation. Continued bullishness amid the Maxwell upgrade and broad market uptrends could fuel BNB’s price to the next resistance at $720. A breakout might propel the token to the crucial obstacle at $760, beyond which BNB will shift its trajectory to bullishness. However, sudden selling pressure might cause the token to plunge to the support barrier at $520-$540.

2025-06-30T05:30:07,"Why is Bitcoin Stuck at $100,000 and Not Rising? Analyst Explains the Real Reason","Charles Edwards, CEO of cryptocurrency analysis company Capriole Investments, made remarkable statements about the stagnation in the Bitcoin price and recent market dynamics. According to Edwards, the reason Bitcoin is stuck at $100,000 levels despite the interest (FOMO) from institutional investors is due to selling pressure from long-term investors. Edwards stated that since the spot ETF launch in January 2024, long-term Bitcoin holders (LTH) have been selling to Wall Street and liquidating their positions. Stating that this situation is reflected in the media in different ways, Edwards argued that the real reason is these sales. The CEO recalled a prediction he made in April, saying that companies holding Bitcoin treasury would create a “flywheel” effect, triggering a massive buying wave in the market and pushing the ETF narrative to the background. Edwards said that this effect is now clearly visible and many new companies are joining this trend. Related News: Latest Report on Cryptocurrency Owners in South Korea Released - Major Changes Are Underway, Here Are the Trends Examining on-chain data, Edwards explained that there has been a huge increase in the number of investors holding BTC for more than 6 months in the last two months, and that the purchases made by this group more than covered all the BTC sold by LTHs in the last 1.5 years. He evaluated this situation as “incredible.” Edwards also stated that such aggressive increases are usually followed by price squeezes, which is a short-term bullish sign. However, Edwards noted that there is still some weakness in the general on-chain data, and stated that recovery is possible if this buying momentum continues: “Can Treasury companies continue this rapid pace of buying? I think this cycle is just beginning. If aggressive buying by investors with a 6-month holding continues, the market could overcome this weakness.” *This is not investment advice.
