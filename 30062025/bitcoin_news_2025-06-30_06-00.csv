2025-06-30T03:49:13,"XRP Price Prediction For June 30","The post XRP Price Prediction For June 30 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP’s price action has been volatile over the past week, and right now, it’s testing a resistance level around the $2.19 to $2.20 mark. This level has proven difficult for XRP to break in recent days, with the token getting rejected each time it approaches this zone. A confirmed move above $2.20, with prices holding steadily, could open the door for a rally toward the next target around $2.25. The next resistance area sits between $2.30 and $2.35. Support Zones to Watch On the downside, XRP has strong support levels between $2.10 and $2.07. If prices drop, these levels are expected to attract buying interest and potentially stabilize the market. As of now, XRP seems to be trading sideways within this range, showing no clear breakout in either direction. A Market Moving with Bitcoin XRP’s next big move could depend heavily on what Bitcoin does next. If Bitcoin struggles to break through its own resistance levels, altcoins like XRP could follow a similar path, staying range-bound for a little longer. On the other hand, if Bitcoin makes a strong breakout, it might give XRP the momentum it needs to move higher. Long-Term Outlook Still Positive Looking at the bigger picture, XRP has been holding firm within a wider price channel for several months. While the short-term trend appears neutral, the long-term setup remains bullish as long as prices stay above key support levels. On the bullish side, XRP now has over 7.1 million wallets.. The price may be taking a short break, but another big move could be coming soon. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.19. A successful push above $2.20 could be the first step in a fresh rally.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-prediction-for-june-30/,"XRP|TRADING|MARKET|BTC|ALTCOIN","News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

2025-06-30T03:30:33,"Bitcoin Price Surges Above $108,000: Analyst Predicts Potential Breakout To $150,000","The Bitcoin price has recently climbed back above the $108,000 mark, yet it struggles to surpass its current record of $111,800, creating a sense of uncertainty in the market. This persistent inability to break through has characterized the cryptocurrency’s performance in recent weeks, leaving analysts to speculate on its next moves. Analyst Predicts Major Upswing Crypto analyst Doctor Profit has outlined two potential scenarios for the Bitcoin price trajectory in the near term, offering insights into both immediate volatility and a long-term bullish outlook. In a recent post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Doctor Profit emphasized the significance of the current market conditions, suggesting that Bitcoin could reach between $120,000 and $150,000 in the coming months. Related Reading: Dogecoin Silent Build-Up: Double Bottom Hints At Explosive Move To $0.47 According to Doctor Profit, the market is poised for a breakout. He noted, “We’re standing in front of a breakout, one that has the potential to send Bitcoin into the $120,000–$150,000 zone over the next few months.” This assertion is supported by data reflecting strong on-chain activity, favorable technical structures, liquidity flow, and macroeconomic factors. While the long-term outlook appears promising, he cautioned that short-term fluctuations will remain prevalent. Two Scenarios For The Bitcoin Price Doctor Profit outlined two primary outcomes that traders should consider. The first scenario involves a bullish breakout from a bull flag pattern, allowing Bitcoin to surge past the $113,000 resistance level and continue climbing without a pullback. However, the analyst views this scenario as overly simplistic, suggesting that market makers typically prefer not to allow such parabolic moves to occur without a preceding shakeout. The second scenario, which appears more likely, involves either a rejection at the bull flag breakout or a liquidity grab at the $113,000 mark. This would potentially lead Bitcoin to revisit the lower boundary of the current range, around $90,000 to $93,000. Doctor Profit noted that this region is attractive because it contains significant liquidity and a notable gap in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) futures market. He views a dip to these levels not as a bearish signal, but rather as an opportunity to accumulate more Bitcoin. In his analysis, he stated, “$93K is not bearish. It’s clearly a gift!.” Doctor Profit believes that this potential dip would not only reset market leverage but also shake out weaker hands, creating a more robust foundation for a subsequent rally. Macroeconomic Trends Favor BTC Looking at the long-term prospects, Doctor Profit highlighted that larger wallets continue to accumulate Bitcoin, indicating that major investors are positioning themselves for a significant upward movement. He pointed to macroeconomic indicators, particularly the M2 money supply, which suggests that Bitcoin remains undervalued relative to broader economic trends. Related Reading: TD Sequential Flashes Buy: Dogecoin Ready For Rebound To $0.21 Notably, the Bitcoin price has been trading within its current range for 226 days, which echoes patterns observed during previous accumulation phases before major price breakouts. As Doctor Profit concluded, the Bitcoin price trajectory remains optimistic, with expectations of reaching between $120,000 and $150,000 in the foreseeable future. He notes that while there are multiple paths to achieving this target, a dip into the $90,000 to $93,000 range would provide a crucial opportunity for accumulation and set the stage for a powerful upward move.

2025-06-30T03:00:44,"Top US Finance Expert: Bitcoin Deserves A Bigger Slice Of Your Portfolio","US financial advisor Ric Edelman has upped his Bitcoin recommendation from a cautious 1% to a bold 10–40% of investors’ portfolios. He points to the January 2024 launch of US Bitcoin spot ETFs, which funneled in more than $10 billion in their opening months, as proof that digital assets are here to stay. Having watched governments and major firms embrace crypto, he now believes the risks that once held him back are largely behind us. Strong Growth In Bitcoin ETFs According to reports, the launch of US Bitcoin spot exchange‑traded funds in January 2024 opened the floodgates. These ETFs have drawn in billions of dollars and put digital currency at the front of many investors’ minds. Sales figures show that ETFs poured in more than $10 billion in their first months on the market. Those numbers have convinced many that Bitcoin is no longer a niche play. Major Players Show Their Hand Based on interviews and filings, nation‑states like Pakistan and the UAE have started to add Bitcoin to their reserves. Public companies such as MicroStrategy (now Strategy ) and Metaplanet keep buying more coins, while big finance names—Barclays Bank, Avenir, and Goldman Sachs—have dipped their toes in through those same ETFs. This level of interest would have sounded impossible back in 2020 when Bitcoin was still seen as an experiment. Questioning The 60/40 Rule Edelman pointed out that the classic 60% stocks and 40% bonds formula isn’t cutting it anymore. With people living longer and bond yields at historic lows, retirement accounts are in need of a boost. He contends that Bitcoin’s gains over the past decade have outpaced every other major asset class. Based on charts, Bitcoin climbed over 1,400% between 2015 and 2025, while the S&P 500 posted around 250% in the same span. Bold Price Goals On The Table Analysts aren’t holding back when it comes to price targets. Some see Bitcoin hitting $500,000 or $1 million in this cycle. High‑profile backers go even further—Michael Saylor has talked about $13 million per coin if certain on‑chain signals line up. These figures sound wild. They also explain why a 40% allocation could feel tempting to aggressive investors. Balancing Risk And Reward Still, experts warn that Bitcoin’s swings remain sharp. Prices can rise or fall by 20% in a day. A 40% weighting means big gains when markets rally and big losses when they drop. Many advisors suggest a smaller 5–10% Bitcoin holding for those who want some upside without risking their entire nest egg. What This Means Based on reports from the Digital Asset Council of Financial Advisors, everyday investors might not need to go all‑in just yet. A gradual approach can help you learn the market and adjust if volatility spikes. It’s a fast‑moving scene, so keeping an eye on ETF inflows, regulatory updates, and network health will be key.

2025-06-30T02:24:54,"Projected XRP Price If It Reclaims Half of Its Peak Market Dominance","As the total cryptocurrency market capitalization exceeds $3.28 trillion, discussions have resurfaced around XRP’s underperformance relative to other major assets. Despite its early presence and significant impact during previous market cycles, XRP has not mirrored the broader growth seen across the crypto sector over the past decade. Analysts suggest that even a partial recovery of its past market dominance could trigger a significant price increase. XRP’s Lagging Growth Compared to the Market Over the last ten years, the global cryptocurrency market has surged from $4.28 billion to over $3.28 trillion, a staggering 76,528% increase. Bitcoin and several altcoins have grown in parallel with this expansion, recording gains that align with or exceed the market’s pace. XRP, however, has not followed this trend. A key factor limiting XRP’s growth has been ongoing regulatory challenges, most notably its legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These issues led to temporary delistings from major exchanges, restricting access for U.S.-based investors and stalling momentum during critical growth periods. Historical Market Dominance: XRP vs. Bitcoin In May 2017, XRP reached its peak market dominance of 31.33%, supported by a market capitalization of $15.28 billion when the total crypto market was $48.78 billion. At the same time, Bitcoin’s market cap stood at $29 billion, giving it a 59.45% share of the total market. Since then, Bitcoin has grown in line with the market. Its capitalization has risen to $2.132 trillion, a 7,251% increase from 2017. XRP, on the other hand, has climbed only 743% during the same period, reaching a market cap of $128.8 billion. Consequently, XRP’s market dominance has dropped from 31.33% to just 3.96%, while Bitcoin’s has increased to 65.75%. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Price Projections Based on Reclaiming Market Share Given the current crypto market cap of $3.28 trillion, analysts have explored hypothetical scenarios in which XRP regains a portion of its former dominance. If XRP were to recover just half of its 2017 market dominance, 15.665%, its market capitalization would rise to approximately $513.8 billion. With the circulating supply of XRP estimated at 59 billion tokens, this would result in a price of roughly $8.70 per coin. Notably, this aligns with predictions made by industry figures such as George Tung, who has suggested that XRP could realistically reach $8 to $10 under favourable conditions by the end of the year. While some commentators see $8 as a significant target, others argue that it still undervalues XRP’s full potential, especially given its historical market standing. What If XRP Fully Recovers Its Past Dominance? In a more aggressive scenario, where XRP returns to its full 31.33% dominance, its market capitalization would exceed $1.027 trillion at the current overall market valuation. Based on the existing supply, this would drive the price of one XRP token to approximately $17.40 . Although achieving such a market share would require a significant shift in investor sentiment and regulatory clarity, the figures suggest that substantial upside remains possible, even if XRP only partially regains its historical position. XRP’s current valuation appears modest when measured against its historical performance and the broader market’s growth. A return to just half of its peak market dominance would more than quadruple its current price, while a full recovery could propel XRP to levels not previously reached. These scenarios, although hypothetical, provide a framework for evaluating XRP’s long-term potential in a maturing cryptocurrency market.

2025-06-30T02:04:53,"Spanish Coffee Chain Vanadi approves €1B Bitcoin bet","The board of directors of Vanadi Coffee, a publicly traded coffee chain headquartered in Alicante, Spain, has just signed off on a plan to see the company invest up to €1 billion — roughly $1.17 billion — in Bitcoin. The move , approved by shareholders on June 29, signals a significant departure of the company from previous financial policies , pushing it to the vanguard of corporate adoption of Bitcoin in Spain. A new solution for Bitcoin adherents, the firm has so far purchased 54 BTC, worth around €5.8 million at current prices, and is also eyeing wider expansions. In a recent filing with BME Growth — Spain’s growth division for small- and medium-sized enterprises — Vanadi hinted that they wished to become the largest business holder of Bitcoin in Spain. Vanadi’s stock price went parabolic following the company’s Bitcoin play, increasing more than threefold in June. The increase marks an apparent increase in investor appetite for companies leveraging digital assets as a treasury strategy . Vanadi had said in its translated announcement: “Similar to companies such as Strategy or Metaplanet, Vanadi Coffee redefines its business model and will use Bitcoin as its main reserve asset and accumulate large amounts of Bitcoin as part of its treasury.” The company is looking to replicate the high-wager Bitcoin treasury models of Strategy, which holds over 200,000 BTC, and Metaplanet. The Japanese firm has recently tweaked its balance sheet policy to the pro-Bitcoin side. Vanadi struggles to recover with a Bitcoin bet Vanadi’s had been struggling financially and operationally; its 2024 financial statement lists that it was operating at a loss of €3.3m, an increase of 15.8% from the previous period. Competition and operating costs have eaten away at profitability bit by bit as the cost of coffee has risen ever higher, dragging the firm further into financial strain. Meanwhile, Vanadi was looking for more money to build long-term. It received two large investment offers in May. One was from a tiny local software consultancy, a one-man outfit in Alicante, and he offered 50 million euros. The other was Alpha Blue Ocean, an international firm that announced it would back 15 companies in 15 countries with over €1.5 billion in investment. Critics raise concerns over Vanadi’s ambitious Bitcoin move Vanadi’s daring foray into Bitcoin is not risk-free. The company has a handful of stores serving espresso and pastries, and it is now dipping a toe in the complex world of crypto treasury management. But analysts and sceptics have raised red flags. They also note that Vanadi’s small size, slim operating margins and inexperience in crypto could be left open to volatility and then to scrutiny by regulators. Unlike Strategy, whose tech-focused leadership team has many years of experience navigating capital markets, Vanadi’s management has a steep learning curve ahead. And the regulatory climate for digital assets in Spain is also conservative. It’s not part of an activist group, but it is dynamic, and screwing any of this up in compliance or implementation would be expensive. Vanadi is not alone, though. Companies worldwide are adding Bitcoin to their treasury, which is becoming a trend. US-based crypto firm Bakkt recently revealed its intentions to purchase as much as $1 billion of Bitcoin. Tesla and Coinbase are among the companies that have pursued comparable treasury strategies. What sets Vanadi apart, however, is the scale of its ambition relative to its core business. A €1 billion Bitcoin bet on a café chain with six locations and persistent losses is an aggressive bet by any measure.

2025-06-30T00:00:15,"Best-Selling Author Ric Edelman Drastically Changes Crypto Investment Strategy – Here’s His New Stance: Report","The influential financial advisor who wrote the 2021 book “The Truth about Crypto” is reportedly increasing his recommended investment allocation for crypto. CNBC reports that Ric Edelman, who previously said that allocating as much as 1% to crypto was reasonable, is now saying that financial advisors should recommend allocating between 10% and 40% to digital assets. Says Edelman in an interview with CNBC’s Crypto World, “Today I am saying 40%, that’s astonishing. No one has ever said such a thing.” The founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals is now more bullish on crypto assets amid the massive changes in the industry. According to Edelman, Bitcoin and the broader crypto space faced numerous uncertainties four years ago – from the possibility of government bans on BTC , to concerns about blockchain technology becoming obsolete, to questions about whether digital asset adoption would gain meaningful traction. “Today, all those questions have been resolved. It’s radically changed and is now a mainstream asset.” Edelman also says that Bitcoin and crypto should play a bigger role in long-term investment strategies as life expectancy in the US increases. According to the financial advisor, allocating 60% in stocks and 40% in bonds no longer works, given that Americans can live up to 85 today, or even much older with advances in tech and medicine. “If you’re a financial advisor and you had a 30-year-old client who was saving for their long-term future, you would tell them to put 100% of their money in stocks, because they have 50 years to go. Today’s 60-year-old is kind of like yesterday’s 30-year-old. You need to get better returns than you can get from bonds, and you need to hold equities longer than ever before.” Edelman notes that Bitcoin is a great portfolio diversifier as it doesn’t appear to be correlated with the performance of other asset classes. He also says that digital assets tend to outperform stocks, bonds, gold and others. “Bitcoin prices don’t move in sync with stocks or bonds or gold or oil or commodities… The crypto asset class offers the opportunity for higher returns than you’re likely to get in virtually any other asset class.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-29T23:43:55,"Crypto Cards Gain Ground Over Traditional Banks for Small Payments in Europe","Cryptocurrency-linked payment cards are rapidly gaining traction in Europe, particularly for small purchases typically dominated by cash. According to a new report from CEX.IO, 45% of crypto card transactions fall under the 10-euro mark, reflecting a shift in consumer behaviour and highlighting crypto’s growing role in day-to-day payments. The report, shared with Cointelegraph, noted a 15% year-on-year increase in newly issued CEX.IO crypto cards across the continent in 2025. This trend indicates a broader acceptance of digital assets as a means for routine purchases and suggests that crypto cardholders are now mirroring traditional banking habits, especially when it comes to online spending. Online Spending Nearly Doubles Traditional Usage Rates While the European Central Bank (ECB) reports that 21% of card payments in the eurozone are made online, CEX.IO data shows that 40% of crypto card transactions occur via the internet. This figure nearly doubles the regional average, showcasing the comfort crypto users have with digital platforms. “What we’re seeing in Europe is that crypto card users aren’t just experimenting with new tech — they’re showing us what everyday spending might look like in a truly cashless future,” said Alexandr Kerya, Vice President of Product Management at CEX.IO. He also revealed that average payment volumes have jumped 24% in the past month alone. Crypto Spending Patterns Mirror Traditional Banking The data further illustrates how crypto cardholders are incorporating digital currencies into their daily routines. Groceries represent 59% of crypto card purchases, which is close to the ECB’s 54% average for traditional bank cards. Spending at restaurants and bars accounts for 19% — a higher figure than typical bank card usage in that category. The average crypto card transaction stands at €23.70, lower than the €33.60 average for traditional bank card payments, based on Mastercard’s Q1 2025 data. Stablecoins Lead Transactions as Other Cryptos Gain Ground Stablecoins play a dominant role in these transactions, powering 73% of all crypto card activity. Nevertheless, other leading digital assets such as Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, and Solana are also being used for essentials like groceries, dining, and transport. This mirrors broader usage trends across the crypto sector. For example, platforms like Oobit and Crypto.com are also reporting strong transaction volumes related to everyday spending and online shopping across their European user base. Institutional Pushbacks Continue Despite Adoption Gains However, not all financial institutions are welcoming this trend. Barclays has announced that it will block crypto purchases on its Barclaycard credit cards. The bank cited concerns over the volatility of digital assets and the lack of consumer protections available through traditional financial mechanisms. Barclays emphasized that crypto transactions are not covered by the Financial Ombudsman Service or the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, leaving users exposed in case of disputes or losses. Despite such institutional caution, the momentum behind crypto card usage continues to grow, reflecting an evolving financial landscape that is increasingly embracing digital innovation.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/crypto-cards-gain-ground-over-traditional-banks-for-small-payments-in-europe/,"FIAT|BTC|LTC|REGULATION|SOL","Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|DeFi|Crypto Intelligence",cryptocompare
2025-06-29T23:43:15,"Asia Morning Briefing: ETH Bulls Eye $3K as Validator Backbone Upgrade Rolls In","Good Morning, Asia. Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. As Asia begins a new trading week, ETH is trading close to $2500, up 11% in the seven days, according to CoinDesk market data, outperforming BTC. Market observers have attributed ETH's outperformance versus bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies to a string of bullish headlines in the past few weeks. Stablecoins have regulatory clarity thanks to the GENIUS Act – and Ethereum is home to the most stablecoin deposits; ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continue to see sizable flow. Technical analysis by CoinDesk's analyst Omkar Godbole indicates a potential bullish case is forming on-chain, with traders increasingly viewing $ 3,000 ETH as a possibility in the near future. But behind the scenes, something more fundamental is happening. Ethereum’s validator architecture, the backbone of its proof-of-stake security model, is undergoing a quiet transformation that could cement ETH’s role as Wall Street’s favorite programmable asset. At the center of that shift is distributed validator technology, or DVT, a system that allows Ethereum validators to be split across multiple operators and machines, making them far more resilient, secure, and decentralized. Obol Labs is one of the leading teams behind the technology. “Ethereum is coming back in favor because it’s the most secure and battle-tested blockchain,” said Anthony Bertolino, head of ecosystem at Obol Labs. “And security comes from validators. The most advanced and secure ones now are distributed validators.” Obol’s technology eliminates a long-standing problem in Ethereum staking: single points of failure. Traditional validators rely on a single node to propose and attest to blocks. If that node goes offline or is misconfigured, the validator is penalized, or slashed in Ethereum parlance. Obol’s system uses threshold cryptography and an “active-active” architecture so that even if some nodes fail, the validator keeps running without interruption. This upgrade is not just a technical improvement. It is an institutional requirement. As Ethereum sees inflows from ETFs, funds, and structured finance products, staking infrastructure needs to meet the standards of traditional capital allocators. Blockdaemon, for instance, recently announced that it is integrating Obol's distributed validator technology into its staking infrastructure. Blockdaemon is a $100 billion name for institutional crypto. “Historically, institutions had to choose between performance and security,” Bertolino said. “Now they get both.” Momentum is building fast. Lido, Ethereum’s largest staking protocol with $22 billion in total value locked , is preparing to approve distributed validator use across its “Curated Set” — the collection of professional node operators who manage over 30 percent of all staked ETH. A new governance proposal would allow these operators to use either Obol or SSV in intra-operator setups, and eventually expand usage across thousands of validators. This move builds on the success of Lido’s Simple DVT Module, which has already deployed over 9,600 DVT-powered validators with a 97.5 percent effectiveness score, outperforming the network average. “These clusters are already showing better uptime, higher effectiveness, and similar yields to conventional setups,” Bertolino said. “This is the infrastructure shift that makes Ethereum staking enterprise-grade.” For Ethereum, the implications go beyond validator design. DVT mitigates one of the network’s core criticisms, that its staking layer is increasingly centralized, and helps fulfill the vision of Ethereum to be neutral, distributed infrastructure. ""Institutions are thinking about two things. How do I secure the assets, and how do I generate attractive yield? Historically, you had to choose one. DVT gives you both,” Bertolino said. And Wall Street continues to pay attention. News Recap: Short COIN, Long BTC as Coinbase Nears Overvaluation, Says 10x Research Coinbase shares have surged 84% in the past two months, far outpacing bitcoin’s 14% gain and raising red flags about overvaluation, according to 10x Research, covered late last week by CoinDesk . In a Friday note, Head of Research Markus Thielen recommended a short COIN/long BTC trade, arguing that Coinbase’s fundamentals—mainly trading volumes—don’t justify the rally. “While Coinbase hasn’t quite breached the +30% overvaluation threshold, it’s approaching fast,” Thielen wrote, suggesting options strategies or pair trades to exploit the potential reversal. 10x’s model finds 75% of COIN’s price action is tied to bitcoin’s price and volumes, meaning recent gains likely reflect excessive speculation. The report notes other bullish catalysts, including Circle’s IPO and U.S. stablecoin legislation, are likely priced in, while Korean investor momentum is fading. “This rare deviation suggests Coinbase’s valuation is extended and vulnerable to mean reversion,” Thielen said, warning that COIN could soon follow other overheated crypto stocks lower. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin is trading above $108K as Asia opens its trading week, but analyst Michaël van de Poppe says it must break $109K resistance to sustain momentum, with the rally fueled more by leveraged futures than spot demand. ETH: Ethereum broke above $2,440 with strong volume support, signaling bullish momentum amid new U.S. stock market highs, improving global liquidity, and easing geopolitical tensions. Gold: Gold is trading at $3,248.26, down slightly, as Australia cuts its commodity export earnings forecast due to weak iron ore and gas prices despite surging gold. Nikkei 225: Nikkei 225 futures are trending higher with an expectation that the White House will reach trade deals with Japan and other export-heavy Asian economies.

2025-06-29T23:30:00,"Over Half of South Koreans Have Crypto Trading Experience – Survey","More than half of South Koreans aged 20 to 59 have crypto trading experience, with one in four currently HODLing coins. The same survey found that current crypto owners say that tokens like Bitcoin (BTC) make up at least 14% of the total value of their financial assets. South Koreans: Crypto Trading on the Rise? The newspaper Cheonji Ilbo reported that the survey of 1,000 people nationwide was conducted in April this year by the Hana Financial Group’s Research Institute. South Korea called for a “mutually beneficial” agreement on trade with the US during its new trade minister’s first trip to Washington this week. https://t.co/qeMmYlICCy — Bloomberg (@business) June 28, 2025 The survey’s authors explained that 51% of the people they spoke to “had experience investing in crypto,” with 27% currently HODLing their coins. In this latter group, investors said they were holding onto an average of around 13 million won ($9,547) worth of coins. In the early stages of investment, the researchers found, traders tended to focus on Bitcoin. However, they also found that as traders gained experience, they tended to buy more altcoins, with a focus on stablecoins . Wallets on Multiple Exchanges The data also appears to indicate that many South Korean traders are prepared to shop around to find better prices. Over half of the respondents said they held crypto wallets on multiple domestic crypto exchanges . Seven out of 10 said they have traded on the market-leading trading platform Upbit. Trading volumes on the Upbit crypto exchange over the past three months. (Source: CoinGecko) The majority of crypto-trading survey participants (60%) said they began investing in crypto in earnest during the 2020 Bitcoin bull run. Three-quarters of investors began investing with stakes worth less than 3 million won ($2,203). However, the value of their collective investments appears to have risen considerably. Over four in 10 of the crypto investors said they currently have coins worth more than 10 million won ($7,344) in their wallets. Majority of Traders Are Male Office Workers, Data Shows Most crypto investors were aged 40-49, with 67% of male respondents and just 33% of women saying they had bought coins. The majority of crypto investors (over half) said they were in white collar office jobs, with just 12% of physical laborers saying they had crypto holdings. The data also indicated that crypto investing-South Koreans tend to take more risks in the financial markets. The researchers noted that 38% of respondents showed signs of taking an “active” or “aggressive” approach to investment tendency. This, they said, was twice the overall average of 20%. The research institute explained: “Investors who have tried and experienced virtual asset investment even once had a higher aggressive investment tendency than investors who have no experience with crypto.” The top eight coins on the Bithumb platform by trading volumes over the past 24 hours. (Source: CoinGecko) Stablecoin Spike The findings appear to correlate with recent reports of a large spike in USD-pegged stablecoin and kimchi coin trading .

And after the June 3 election of President Lee Jae-myung, speculative buying in stablecoin-related tokens has also seen an uptick.

2025-06-29T22:51:40,"Bitcoin Jumps After Trump Says Growth Will Offset Deficits, Boosting Bull Case for BTC and Gold","Bitcoin (BTC) BTC traded at $107,937 as of 22:22 UTC on Sunday, up 0.54% over the past 24 hours, as attention turned to fiscal policy tensions in Washington following President Trump's latest post on Truth Social. Price action remained volatile, with BTC fluctuating between $107,194 and $108,489 during the 24-hour window, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. On June 29, 2025, President Donald Trump posted a pointed message on Truth Social addressing Republican lawmakers amid intense debate over his sweeping tax-and-spending package. “For all cost cutting Republicans, of which I am one, REMEMBER, you still have to get reelected. Don’t go too crazy! We will make it all up, times 10, with GROWTH, more than ever before,” he wrote. This statement underscores the deep divisions within the GOP as it wrestles with the ambitious legislation dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill.” The bill, exceeding 900 pages, combines roughly $3.8 trillion in tax cuts with targeted spending reductions and increased funding for defense and border security. It seeks to make permanent many of the tax breaks from Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including eliminating taxes on tips, overtime pay, and certain auto loans. The child tax credit would rise to $2,200 under the Senate version, while deductions for seniors would increase temporarily. However, to offset these tax cuts, Republicans propose significant cuts to Medicaid and nutrition programs, sparking fierce debate within the party. Moderate Republicans from high-tax states are pushing for a higher cap on state and local tax deductions (SALT), while conservatives demand deeper spending cuts, particularly targeting Medicaid. These internal disagreements complicate efforts to secure the narrow Republican majorities needed in both chambers to pass the bill, which Democrats uniformly oppose as favoring the wealthy and worsening inequality. Trump’s social media message reflects an attempt to balance these competing pressures — urging fiscal restraint to satisfy conservatives while emphasizing that robust economic growth will compensate for revenue losses and help reduce deficits over time. This supply-side economic approach projects that growth will “make it all up” despite near-term increases in the national debt, which nonpartisan analysts estimate could add trillions to the existing $36.2 trillion debt. Crypto analyst Will Clemente’s reaction on X (formerly Twitter) shortly after Trump’s post captures a common market sentiment: “How can you read this and hold long term US treasuries at current yields lol... Also, how can you read this and not hold any Bitcoin or gold.” Clemente’s skepticism toward long-term U.S. Treasuries reflects concerns that the bill’s deficit-financed tax cuts and modest spending cuts signal a loose fiscal policy that could fuel inflation and currency debasement. In this context, traditional fixed-income assets like Treasuries may appear less attractive, as rising deficits and potential monetary accommodation threaten bond values. Conversely, hard assets such as gold and Bitcoin are increasingly viewed as stores of value and hedges against inflation and fiscal risk. The expectation of sustained deficits and political challenges to fiscal discipline bolster demand for these inflation-resistant assets. With the Senate racing to finalize the bill before the July 4 holiday, Trump’s call for unity and moderation highlights the high stakes and political challenges in passing one of the most consequential fiscal packages in recent U.S. history. The bill’s fate remains uncertain as lawmakers negotiate to balance tax relief, spending cuts, and political feasibility. Technical Analysis Highlights From June 28 15:00 to June 29 14:00 UTC, BTC traded from $107,194 to $108,489, a 1.21% intraday range. Support was established at $107,300, with multiple rebounds during the 02:00–03:00 window. Volume peaked at 7,538 BTC between 08:00 and 11:00 UTC on June 29, confirming upward momentum. During the final session hour (13:05–14:04 UTC), BTC fell from $108,219 to $108,059, forming a descending channel. A 130 BTC volume spike at 13:35 coincided with a sharp dip to $108,030, which was tested and held. Final intraday rally pushed price back toward $108K before fading slightly by 22:22 UTC to $107,937.

2025-06-29T22:00:47,"Cathie Wood Says New Mortgage Rule May Benefit Crypto","Cathie Wood, leader of Ark Invest, has publicly endorsed a proposal from the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). The housing agency is considering a new rule that could allow people to use Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies when applying for home loans. Bitcoin May Soon Be Used in Mortgage Applications This change could help many crypto holders qualify for mortgages without having to convert their digital money into physical cash. The proposal has caught the attention of top financial leaders, including Strategy’s Chairman, Michael Saylor. She believes this proposal, if approved, could give the digital asset a bigger role in the U.S. financial system. Under the current system, banks typically verify a person’s income, employment status, and credit history before approving a mortgage. This can be a problem for individuals who own a significant amount of cryptocurrency but do not have a steady income or a regular job. This is because banks have not widely accepted digital assets as tangible proof of wealth. The FHFA’s proposal is set to change that. The new rule would allow crypto holders to use their digital assets as part of their loan application. This means they might not need to sell their Bitcoin to prove they can afford a home. Cathie Wood and Michael Saylor Weigh In Cathie Wood supported the idea, saying it could help more people become homeowners and increase the acceptance of crypto in the economy. Michael Saylor, another big supporter of Bitcoin , agreed and said Bitcoin is not just a risky investment. He added that the digital coin is a strong store of value and a powerful tool for resisting authoritarian financial control . In his view, Bitcoin deserves the same recognition as traditional assets, such as cash or stocks. He added that home ownership should not be out of reach for people with Bitcoin holdings. This is especially important for early Bitcoin investors and individuals who earn in cryptocurrency but lack formal income documents. Bitcoin to See Mainstream Use Bill Pulte, the new Director of FHFA, also backed the proposal. In a recent X post , he stated that the housing agency will carefully examine how cryptocurrency can reflect a borrower’s financial strength. This signals a growing effort to bring digital assets into the core of everyday finance. Meanwhile, the United Wholesale Mortgage became the first mortgage company to accept cryptocurrency payments . However, the initiative was halted in 2021 due to ongoing regulatory uncertainty. Fast-forward to 2025, crypto-friendly policies are now gaining momentum across the country. This comes as President Donald Trump has shared his vision to make America the crypto capital of the world. If the FHFA’s proposed rule is implemented, it could also attract more banks and large companies to the crypto space. It would help make Bitcoin more than just an investment; it could become a real tool for building and securing wealth.

2025-06-29T21:13:09,"Bitcoin Mining Companies’ Revenues Are Falling, But They’re Not Selling – What Does This Mean Historically?","Cryptocurrency analytics company Alphractal has published a remarkable assessment of the Bitcoin mining industry. The report notes that miners are not selling their Bitcoin reserves despite facing historically low profitability. Total transaction fees paid on the Bitcoin network have fallen to their lowest levels since 2012. This is attributed to the fact that on-chain activity has been extremely low this cycle, severely reducing miner revenues. Despite the recent decrease in hash rate, there has been no adjustment to the network difficulty yet. This delay further narrows miners’ margins and delays the network from reaching balance. Related News: Tomorrow is a Critical Day for BNB - Here's What to Expect The Bitcoin network is experiencing the highest hash rate fluctuations in its history. This is believed to be due to some major mining operations shutting down their ASIC devices, with falling revenues and decreasing network demand being cited as the reasons. Despite the difficult mining conditions, the fact that miners have not yet sold their reserves is considered a positive sign. According to Alphractal, some mining pools may have scaled back their activities in line with the decline in global chain usage. With Bitcoin trading above $107,000, miners are thought to be reallocating hash power based on current demand. According to the analyst firm, in past cycles, miners typically sold during periods of rapid price appreciation and increased network activity. However, both elements are currently at low levels, suggesting that the market may be in a period of “adjustment” rather than “capitulation.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-29T20:48:00,"Crypto Presale of the Decade: Bitcoin Solaris Set to Create More Millionaires Than Original Bitcoin","Back in 2010, a few hundred bucks and a little courage could’ve made you a Bitcoin millionaire. Fast forward to today, and the crypto world is asking one big question, what’s the next Bitcoin moment? Some say it won’t happen again. Others are pointing to a new contender that isn’t trying to replace Bitcoin, but elevate its legacy. That project is Bitcoin Solaris, and its explosive presale is already turning early believers into future legends. Bitcoin Was the Spark, But Now It’s About the Flame Let’s be honest, Bitcoin’s price might keep rising, but it’s no longer the coin that makes millionaires overnight. The original crypto asset has matured into a store of value, like digital gold. Safe? Sure. Fast returns? Not anymore. That’s why even long-time Bitcoin holders are now eyeing something different. Bitcoin Solaris doesn’t just offer a faster chain or better DeFi. It combines speed, scalability, and mining access into a wealth-generation engine designed for the modern crypto era. And early adopters are paying attention for a reason. What Makes Bitcoin Solaris So Different? Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is not another “altcoin” chasing hype. It’s a next-gen blockchain that fuses Bitcoin’s scarcity with Solana-style throughput, while adding real-world accessibility through mobile mining. Let’s break down what gives BTC-S its edge: 10,000 transactions per second and 2-second finality, made possible by a hybrid architecture A dual-layer blockchain featuring Proof of Work (PoW) for the base layer and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) for the Solaris Layer Advanced validator rotation to keep block production efficient and secure Smart contract support built with cross-chain bridges to expand DeFi use cases Energy-efficient mobile mining through the exciting release of the Solaris Nova app And yes, this is all backed by not one, but two independent audits. The Cyberscope and Freshcoins audits both verified the smart contract integrity of BTC-S, giving presale investors even more peace of mind. Smart Contracts at Lightning Speed See Why Developers Love BTC-S Tokenomics Built for the Long Run The way Bitcoin Solaris handles its token distribution reflects its deep understanding of scarcity, fairness, and community power. Its tokenomics model is as follows: 66.66% allocated to mining, released over 90 years 20% for presale participants 5% to liquidity pools 2% each for community rewards, marketing, staking incentives, and ecosystem development 0.33% reserved for team and advisors This structure ensures the vast majority of BTC-S ends up in the hands of real users, not insiders or whales. The Presale That’s Breaking All Records If you’ve been watching presale trends, you’ll know they usually fizzle fast. Not this one. Bitcoin Solaris is currently in the last day in phase 9 , with a price of $9, set to rise to $10 in the next phase. It’s heading for a $20 launch, promising 150% gains out the gate. With less than 5 weeks remaining, the momentum is getting louder: Over 12,800+ unique buyers More than $5.8 million raised One of the shortest, most viral presales in recent memory Make sure to use Trust Wallet or Metamask to claim your tokens after the presale ends. In addition, Bitcoin Solaris introduced daily mini games for holders for a chance to earn daily free prizes, checkout the full breakdown here. Mobile Mining and Wealth Made Simple The upcoming Solaris Nova app will allow users to earn BTC-S tokens directly from their phones. This isn’t fake mining. The energy-efficient algorithm is real, and results are tracked transparently. You can even simulate your rewards using the official mining calculator . This mobile-first approach removes the barrier to entry, making wealth generation accessible to anyone with a smartphone. And with the mining rewards backed by real chain mechanics, early users can stack coins daily without touching a traditional rig. Influencer Eyes Are on It Too Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just turning heads in chat rooms. It’s being talked about by some of the sharpest names in the space. For example, the Token Galaxy review dives into why this project’s fundamentals and architecture set it apart from the dozens of gimmick tokens launching every month. That same review also highlights the audited backing, the presale strength, and the growing buzz across platforms like the official Telegram and X . The Final Verdict Not every day offers the chance to make early-mover gains in a project that feels destined to last. Bitcoin Solaris combines the credibility of Bitcoin’s fixed-supply philosophy with the agility of modern blockchain architecture. With real mobile mining, a dual-consensus model, blazing-fast TPS, and a community-first token model, it’s no surprise investors are calling it the crypto presale of the decade. There may never be another Bitcoin. But Bitcoin Solaris just might create more millionaires than the original.

2025-06-29T20:32:46,"Bitcoin Miners HODL Through Worst Payout in a Year: CryptoQuant","Bitcoin may be struggling to rally past its all-time high of $112,000, but miners are going through a tougher time. They have recently recorded some of their worst paydays in history. On-chain data, including the Miner Profit/Loss Sustainability metric, analyzed by the market intelligence platform CryptoQuant, revealed that miner revenues have declined significantly. However, this has not triggered any form of panic selling among them. Miner Revenues Plummet According to the report , miners are the most underpaid they have been in a year. On June 22, daily revenues fell to a two-month low of $34 million due to lower transaction fees and the latest plunge in bitcoin’s (BTC) price. CryptoQuant said the figure is the lowest since April 20. While miner revenues remain low, the hashrate of the Bitcoin network has also declined slightly. This metric has plummeted 3.5% since June 16; while CryptoQuant sees this as a small drawdown, it is the largest plunge since July 2024. The Bitcoin network hashrate fell 8.4% in July 2024 as miner revenues dropped following the halving that slashed block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. Regardless of the low revenues, miner outflows have dropped, indicating that selling is still muted. Bitcoin transfers from miners to crypto exchanges have fallen from a daily peak of 23,000 BTC in February to about 6,000 BTC currently. CryptoQuant said miners are not selling as much as they used to because they are still enjoying 48% Net Unrealized Profit/Loss operating margins. Still Room for Growth Notably, miners have not recorded any days of extremely high flows to exchanges since February. In fact, large miners have been replenishing their reserves. CryptoQuant’s analysts found that miner addresses holding between 100 BTC and 1,000 BTC have expanded their collective holdings from 61,000 BTC on March 31 to 65,000 BTC currently. This is their highest level since November 2024, when reserves fell below 71,000 BTC after BTC rallied past $100,000 for the first time. The spike in reserves further solidifies the belief that there is no selling pressure from them at bitcoin’s current price levels. Additionally, miners from the Satoshi era have only sold 150 BTC so far this year, compared to roughly 10,000 BTC last year. This cohort of market participants often sells during strong rallies, indicating market tops. Since they have refrained from selling so far, it implies that BTC still has more room for growth.

The rise in TON value could be attributed to the recovery in the crypto market, which saw Bitcoin rise above $100,000. Will TON reach $10? Yes, TON should rise above $10 in 2027.

In June 2020, all Toncoin tokens (98.55% of the total supply) became available for mining. The tokens were placed in special Giver smart contracts, enabling anyone to mine until 28 June 2022. Users mined around 200,000 TON daily. All the tokens were mined in two years, marking the completion of the distribution event. On September 20, 2021, TON registered its all-time low price at $0.3906. Its first significant break came in November 2021. In days, the coin slid from $0.8 to $4.5. It corrected in 2022, reaching a low of $0.9. In 2023, it ranged between $1.1 and $2.5. In 2024, it registered another bull run, rising from $2.11 to its all-time high of $8.24 on Jun 15, 2024. It corrected later and traded at the $5.2 mark in October and $4.98 in November when it started recovering. The recovery saw the coin rise above $6.5 in December. It then crossed into 2025, trading at $5.5. From there, it assumed a bear run as it fell below $3.8 in February and $3.0 in May. It crossed into June, trading at $3.20.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ton-price-prediction/,"MARKET|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|TON|BTC","Crypto Price Predictions|Toncoin",cryptocompare
2025-06-29T20:06:06,"New Developments Regarding the Fate of Terra (LUNA) Founder Do Kwon – There May Be a Glimmer of Hope, Here Are the Critical Dates","In the case of Terraform Labs and Terra (LUNA) co-founder Do Hyeong Kwon, the defense team has requested a two-week postponement of the pretrial filing deadline of July 1, 2025. According to the petition filed in the Federal Court for the Southern District of New York, the parties believe that extending the deadline will help “avoid unnecessary filing processes.” The prosecutor’s office agrees with the request. Lawyers stated that Kwon was ready, but that the extension would be beneficial due to the “productive discussions” between the parties. It was also reported that the requested postponement would not affect other court dates. Accordingly, the start date of the hearing is still scheduled for February 17, 2026. Related News: How Much Bitcoin Does Elon Musk Currently Hold? Here Are His Assets Following the Latest Changes The parties also reached an agreement on the submission date of expert witness statements. Accordingly, the defense will submit their statements on December 1, 2025, one month after the government's statements on October 31, 2025. During a hearing last week, Judge Paul Engelmayer hinted that the newly passed GENIUS Act could affect the course of the case. The GENIUS (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins) Act, which passed the US Senate on June 17, aims to regulate stablecoins for payment purposes. This bill has not yet been voted on in the House of Representatives and awaits President Donald Trump’s signature, but if passed, it could change the legal basis for the accusations against Kwon regarding TerraUSD (UST) and the LUNA token. *This is not investment advice.
