2025-06-30T02:24:54,"Projected XRP Price If It Reclaims Half of Its Peak Market Dominance","As the total cryptocurrency market capitalization exceeds $3.28 trillion, discussions have resurfaced around XRP’s underperformance relative to other major assets. Despite its early presence and significant impact during previous market cycles, XRP has not mirrored the broader growth seen across the crypto sector over the past decade. Analysts suggest that even a partial recovery of its past market dominance could trigger a significant price increase. XRP’s Lagging Growth Compared to the Market Over the last ten years, the global cryptocurrency market has surged from $4.28 billion to over $3.28 trillion, a staggering 76,528% increase. Bitcoin and several altcoins have grown in parallel with this expansion, recording gains that align with or exceed the market’s pace. XRP, however, has not followed this trend. A key factor limiting XRP’s growth has been ongoing regulatory challenges, most notably its legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These issues led to temporary delistings from major exchanges, restricting access for U.S.-based investors and stalling momentum during critical growth periods. Historical Market Dominance: XRP vs. Bitcoin In May 2017, XRP reached its peak market dominance of 31.33%, supported by a market capitalization of $15.28 billion when the total crypto market was $48.78 billion. At the same time, Bitcoin’s market cap stood at $29 billion, giving it a 59.45% share of the total market. Since then, Bitcoin has grown in line with the market. Its capitalization has risen to $2.132 trillion, a 7,251% increase from 2017. XRP, on the other hand, has climbed only 743% during the same period, reaching a market cap of $128.8 billion. Consequently, XRP’s market dominance has dropped from 31.33% to just 3.96%, while Bitcoin’s has increased to 65.75%. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Price Projections Based on Reclaiming Market Share Given the current crypto market cap of $3.28 trillion, analysts have explored hypothetical scenarios in which XRP regains a portion of its former dominance. If XRP were to recover just half of its 2017 market dominance, 15.665%, its market capitalization would rise to approximately $513.8 billion. With the circulating supply of XRP estimated at 59 billion tokens, this would result in a price of roughly $8.70 per coin. Notably, this aligns with predictions made by industry figures such as George Tung, who has suggested that XRP could realistically reach $8 to $10 under favourable conditions by the end of the year. While some commentators see $8 as a significant target, others argue that it still undervalues XRP’s full potential, especially given its historical market standing. What If XRP Fully Recovers Its Past Dominance? In a more aggressive scenario, where XRP returns to its full 31.33% dominance, its market capitalization would exceed $1.027 trillion at the current overall market valuation. Based on the existing supply, this would drive the price of one XRP token to approximately $17.40 . Although achieving such a market share would require a significant shift in investor sentiment and regulatory clarity, the figures suggest that substantial upside remains possible, even if XRP only partially regains its historical position. XRP’s current valuation appears modest when measured against its historical performance and the broader market’s growth. A return to just half of its peak market dominance would more than quadruple its current price, while a full recovery could propel XRP to levels not previously reached. These scenarios, although hypothetical, provide a framework for evaluating XRP’s long-term potential in a maturing cryptocurrency market.

2025-06-30T02:04:53,"Spanish Coffee Chain Vanadi approves €1B Bitcoin bet","The board of directors of Vanadi Coffee, a publicly traded coffee chain headquartered in Alicante, Spain, has just signed off on a plan to see the company invest up to €1 billion — roughly $1.17 billion — in Bitcoin. The move , approved by shareholders on June 29, signals a significant departure of the company from previous financial policies , pushing it to the vanguard of corporate adoption of Bitcoin in Spain. A new solution for Bitcoin adherents, the firm has so far purchased 54 BTC, worth around €5.8 million at current prices, and is also eyeing wider expansions. In a recent filing with BME Growth — Spain’s growth division for small- and medium-sized enterprises — Vanadi hinted that they wished to become the largest business holder of Bitcoin in Spain. Vanadi’s stock price went parabolic following the company’s Bitcoin play, increasing more than threefold in June. The increase marks an apparent increase in investor appetite for companies leveraging digital assets as a treasury strategy . Vanadi had said in its translated announcement: “Similar to companies such as Strategy or Metaplanet, Vanadi Coffee redefines its business model and will use Bitcoin as its main reserve asset and accumulate large amounts of Bitcoin as part of its treasury.” The company is looking to replicate the high-wager Bitcoin treasury models of Strategy, which holds over 200,000 BTC, and Metaplanet. The Japanese firm has recently tweaked its balance sheet policy to the pro-Bitcoin side. Vanadi struggles to recover with a Bitcoin bet Vanadi’s had been struggling financially and operationally; its 2024 financial statement lists that it was operating at a loss of €3.3m, an increase of 15.8% from the previous period. Competition and operating costs have eaten away at profitability bit by bit as the cost of coffee has risen ever higher, dragging the firm further into financial strain. Meanwhile, Vanadi was looking for more money to build long-term. It received two large investment offers in May. One was from a tiny local software consultancy, a one-man outfit in Alicante, and he offered 50 million euros. The other was Alpha Blue Ocean, an international firm that announced it would back 15 companies in 15 countries with over €1.5 billion in investment. Critics raise concerns over Vanadi’s ambitious Bitcoin move Vanadi’s daring foray into Bitcoin is not risk-free. The company has a handful of stores serving espresso and pastries, and it is now dipping a toe in the complex world of crypto treasury management. But analysts and sceptics have raised red flags. They also note that Vanadi’s small size, slim operating margins and inexperience in crypto could be left open to volatility and then to scrutiny by regulators. Unlike Strategy, whose tech-focused leadership team has many years of experience navigating capital markets, Vanadi’s management has a steep learning curve ahead. And the regulatory climate for digital assets in Spain is also conservative. It’s not part of an activist group, but it is dynamic, and screwing any of this up in compliance or implementation would be expensive. Vanadi is not alone, though. Companies worldwide are adding Bitcoin to their treasury, which is becoming a trend. US-based crypto firm Bakkt recently revealed its intentions to purchase as much as $1 billion of Bitcoin. Tesla and Coinbase are among the companies that have pursued comparable treasury strategies. What sets Vanadi apart, however, is the scale of its ambition relative to its core business. A €1 billion Bitcoin bet on a café chain with six locations and persistent losses is an aggressive bet by any measure. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-06-30T00:00:46,"Ethereum Builds Strength Against Bitcoin: Breakout Prediction Above 0.02 BTC","Ethereum has taken a backseat to Bitcoin’s dominance for most of the past year by trailing in performance and growth of market dominance. But since the start of April, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has gained traction , showing early signs of strength, particularly with inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs in the US. This has caused a shift in Ethereum’s price behavior, especially against Bitcoin. Crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe took to social media platform X to share his latest insights on the ETH/BTC pair, pointing to a specific level that could open the door to Ethereum outperforming Bitcoin. Ethereum Nears Resistance At 0.02 BTC According to van de Poppe, Ethereum is currently trading in what he describes as a no man’s land when paired against Bitcoin. Despite this, he believes that the leading altcoin is doing great and is preparing for a breakout. Notably, the analyst identifies the 0.02325 level on the ETH/BTC pair as the most important threshold. A move above this level, he argues, would likely trigger a strong continuation of Ethereum’s current uptrend. As shown on the 4-hour candlestick timeframe chart that accompanied van de Poppe’s post, the ETH/BTC pair has been forming higher lows since last week . This has caused a buildup of pressure against the horizontal resistance zone. The chart also highlights how Ethereum shot up massively against Bitcoin in early May before hitting a roadblock at $0.026 before pulling a 20% drop to 0.021. However, Ethereum is starting to push up against Bitcoin again with the recent lower highs. All that is now required is for the pair to rise above 0.02325. If this happens, the analyst predicted that Ethereum will start to undergo a strong breakout against Bitcoin. Since the beginning of April, Ethereum has not only stabilized against Bitcoin but has also shown clear signs of outperformance. Van de Poppe noted this change in momentum, stating, “It’s still an $ETH market.” Image From X: Michaël van de Poppe ETH/BTC To Break Out Soon ALthough the momentum is starting to favor Ethereum right now, the breakout isn’t confirmed just yet until it breaches the 0.02325 level against Bitcoin. This makes it the most important level to monitor, according to this technical analysis. If Ethereum manages to close convincingly above this mark, it would confirm the breakout van de Poppe forecasted and could set off a new phase of ETH outperformance across the market. This would possibly usher in the much-anticipated altcoin season . However, if the breakout fails, Ethereum could briefly pull back before making another attempt. Interestingly, the formation of higher lows on ETH/BTC favors a break to the upside. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,440, up by 0.5% in the past 24 hours. This puts it on the path to retesting the $2,500 price level in a breakout move. According to technical analysis from another crypto analyst, Ethereum is currently gearing up for a surge past $10,000.

2025-06-30T00:00:15,"Best-Selling Author Ric Edelman Drastically Changes Crypto Investment Strategy – Here’s His New Stance: Report","The influential financial advisor who wrote the 2021 book “The Truth about Crypto” is reportedly increasing his recommended investment allocation for crypto. CNBC reports that Ric Edelman, who previously said that allocating as much as 1% to crypto was reasonable, is now saying that financial advisors should recommend allocating between 10% and 40% to digital assets. Says Edelman in an interview with CNBC’s Crypto World, “Today I am saying 40%, that’s astonishing. No one has ever said such a thing.” The founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals is now more bullish on crypto assets amid the massive changes in the industry. According to Edelman, Bitcoin and the broader crypto space faced numerous uncertainties four years ago – from the possibility of government bans on BTC , to concerns about blockchain technology becoming obsolete, to questions about whether digital asset adoption would gain meaningful traction. “Today, all those questions have been resolved. It’s radically changed and is now a mainstream asset.” Edelman also says that Bitcoin and crypto should play a bigger role in long-term investment strategies as life expectancy in the US increases. According to the financial advisor, allocating 60% in stocks and 40% in bonds no longer works, given that Americans can live up to 85 today, or even much older with advances in tech and medicine. “If you’re a financial advisor and you had a 30-year-old client who was saving for their long-term future, you would tell them to put 100% of their money in stocks, because they have 50 years to go. Today’s 60-year-old is kind of like yesterday’s 30-year-old. You need to get better returns than you can get from bonds, and you need to hold equities longer than ever before.” Edelman notes that Bitcoin is a great portfolio diversifier as it doesn’t appear to be correlated with the performance of other asset classes. He also says that digital assets tend to outperform stocks, bonds, gold and others. “Bitcoin prices don’t move in sync with stocks or bonds or gold or oil or commodities… The crypto asset class offers the opportunity for higher returns than you’re likely to get in virtually any other asset class.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-29T23:43:55,"Crypto Cards Gain Ground Over Traditional Banks for Small Payments in Europe","Cryptocurrency-linked payment cards are rapidly gaining traction in Europe, particularly for small purchases typically dominated by cash. According to a new report from CEX.IO, 45% of crypto card transactions fall under the 10-euro mark, reflecting a shift in consumer behaviour and highlighting crypto’s growing role in day-to-day payments. The report, shared with Cointelegraph, noted a 15% year-on-year increase in newly issued CEX.IO crypto cards across the continent in 2025. This trend indicates a broader acceptance of digital assets as a means for routine purchases and suggests that crypto cardholders are now mirroring traditional banking habits, especially when it comes to online spending. Online Spending Nearly Doubles Traditional Usage Rates While the European Central Bank (ECB) reports that 21% of card payments in the eurozone are made online, CEX.IO data shows that 40% of crypto card transactions occur via the internet. This figure nearly doubles the regional average, showcasing the comfort crypto users have with digital platforms. “What we’re seeing in Europe is that crypto card users aren’t just experimenting with new tech — they’re showing us what everyday spending might look like in a truly cashless future,” said Alexandr Kerya, Vice President of Product Management at CEX.IO. He also revealed that average payment volumes have jumped 24% in the past month alone. Crypto Spending Patterns Mirror Traditional Banking The data further illustrates how crypto cardholders are incorporating digital currencies into their daily routines. Groceries represent 59% of crypto card purchases, which is close to the ECB’s 54% average for traditional bank cards. Spending at restaurants and bars accounts for 19% — a higher figure than typical bank card usage in that category. The average crypto card transaction stands at €23.70, lower than the €33.60 average for traditional bank card payments, based on Mastercard’s Q1 2025 data. Stablecoins Lead Transactions as Other Cryptos Gain Ground Stablecoins play a dominant role in these transactions, powering 73% of all crypto card activity. Nevertheless, other leading digital assets such as Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, and Solana are also being used for essentials like groceries, dining, and transport. This mirrors broader usage trends across the crypto sector. For example, platforms like Oobit and Crypto.com are also reporting strong transaction volumes related to everyday spending and online shopping across their European user base. Institutional Pushbacks Continue Despite Adoption Gains However, not all financial institutions are welcoming this trend. Barclays has announced that it will block crypto purchases on its Barclaycard credit cards. The bank cited concerns over the volatility of digital assets and the lack of consumer protections available through traditional financial mechanisms. Barclays emphasized that crypto transactions are not covered by the Financial Ombudsman Service or the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, leaving users exposed in case of disputes or losses. Despite such institutional caution, the momentum behind crypto card usage continues to grow, reflecting an evolving financial landscape that is increasingly embracing digital innovation.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/crypto-cards-gain-ground-over-traditional-banks-for-small-payments-in-europe/,"FIAT|BTC|LTC|REGULATION|SOL","Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|DeFi|Crypto Intelligence",cryptocompare

Stablecoins have regulatory clarity thanks to the GENIUS Act – and Ethereum is home to the most stablecoin deposits; ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continue to see sizable flow. Technical analysis by CoinDesk's analyst Omkar Godbole indicates a potential bullish case is forming on-chain, with traders increasingly viewing $ 3,000 ETH as a possibility in the near future. But behind the scenes, something more fundamental is happening. Ethereum’s validator architecture, the backbone of its proof-of-stake security model, is undergoing a quiet transformation that could cement ETH’s role as Wall Street’s favorite programmable asset. At the center of that shift is distributed validator technology, or DVT, a system that allows Ethereum validators to be split across multiple operators and machines, making them far more resilient, secure, and decentralized. Obol Labs is one of the leading teams behind the technology. “Ethereum is coming back in favor because it’s the most secure and battle-tested blockchain,” said Anthony Bertolino, head of ecosystem at Obol Labs. “And security comes from validators. The most advanced and secure ones now are distributed validators.” Obol’s technology eliminates a long-standing problem in Ethereum staking: single points of failure. Traditional validators rely on a single node to propose and attest to blocks. If that node goes offline or is misconfigured, the validator is penalized, or slashed in Ethereum parlance. Obol’s system uses threshold cryptography and an “active-active” architecture so that even if some nodes fail, the validator keeps running without interruption. This upgrade is not just a technical improvement. It is an institutional requirement. As Ethereum sees inflows from ETFs, funds, and structured finance products, staking infrastructure needs to meet the standards of traditional capital allocators. Blockdaemon, for instance, recently announced that it is integrating Obol's distributed validator technology into its staking infrastructure. Blockdaemon is a $100 billion name for institutional crypto. “Historically, institutions had to choose between performance and security,” Bertolino said. “Now they get both.” Momentum is building fast. Lido, Ethereum’s largest staking protocol with $22 billion in total value locked , is preparing to approve distributed validator use across its “Curated Set” — the collection of professional node operators who manage over 30 percent of all staked ETH. A new governance proposal would allow these operators to use either Obol or SSV in intra-operator setups, and eventually expand usage across thousands of validators. This move builds on the success of Lido’s Simple DVT Module, which has already deployed over 9,600 DVT-powered validators with a 97.5 percent effectiveness score, outperforming the network average. “These clusters are already showing better uptime, higher effectiveness, and similar yields to conventional setups,” Bertolino said. “This is the infrastructure shift that makes Ethereum staking enterprise-grade.” For Ethereum, the implications go beyond validator design. DVT mitigates one of the network’s core criticisms, that its staking layer is increasingly centralized, and helps fulfill the vision of Ethereum to be neutral, distributed infrastructure. ""Institutions are thinking about two things. How do I secure the assets, and how do I generate attractive yield? Historically, you had to choose one. DVT gives you both,” Bertolino said. And Wall Street continues to pay attention. News Recap: Short COIN, Long BTC as Coinbase Nears Overvaluation, Says 10x Research Coinbase shares have surged 84% in the past two months, far outpacing bitcoin’s 14% gain and raising red flags about overvaluation, according to 10x Research, covered late last week by CoinDesk . In a Friday note, Head of Research Markus Thielen recommended a short COIN/long BTC trade, arguing that Coinbase’s fundamentals—mainly trading volumes—don’t justify the rally. “While Coinbase hasn’t quite breached the +30% overvaluation threshold, it’s approaching fast,” Thielen wrote, suggesting options strategies or pair trades to exploit the potential reversal. 10x’s model finds 75% of COIN’s price action is tied to bitcoin’s price and volumes, meaning recent gains likely reflect excessive speculation. The report notes other bullish catalysts, including Circle’s IPO and U.S. stablecoin legislation, are likely priced in, while Korean investor momentum is fading. “This rare deviation suggests Coinbase’s valuation is extended and vulnerable to mean reversion,” Thielen said, warning that COIN could soon follow other overheated crypto stocks lower. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin is trading above $108K as Asia opens its trading week, but analyst Michaël van de Poppe says it must break $109K resistance to sustain momentum, with the rally fueled more by leveraged futures than spot demand. ETH: Ethereum broke above $2,440 with strong volume support, signaling bullish momentum amid new U.S. stock market highs, improving global liquidity, and easing geopolitical tensions. Gold: Gold is trading at $3,248.26, down slightly, as Australia cuts its commodity export earnings forecast due to weak iron ore and gas prices despite surging gold. Nikkei 225: Nikkei 225 futures are trending higher with an expectation that the White House will reach trade deals with Japan and other export-heavy Asian economies.

2025-06-29T23:30:00,"Over Half of South Koreans Have Crypto Trading Experience – Survey","More than half of South Koreans aged 20 to 59 have crypto trading experience, with one in four currently HODLing coins. The same survey found that current crypto owners say that tokens like Bitcoin (BTC) make up at least 14% of the total value of their financial assets. South Koreans: Crypto Trading on the Rise? The newspaper Cheonji Ilbo reported that the survey of 1,000 people nationwide was conducted in April this year by the Hana Financial Group’s Research Institute. South Korea called for a “mutually beneficial” agreement on trade with the US during its new trade minister’s first trip to Washington this week. https://t.co/qeMmYlICCy — Bloomberg (@business) June 28, 2025 The survey’s authors explained that 51% of the people they spoke to “had experience investing in crypto,” with 27% currently HODLing their coins. In this latter group, investors said they were holding onto an average of around 13 million won ($9,547) worth of coins. In the early stages of investment, the researchers found, traders tended to focus on Bitcoin. However, they also found that as traders gained experience, they tended to buy more altcoins, with a focus on stablecoins . Wallets on Multiple Exchanges The data also appears to indicate that many South Korean traders are prepared to shop around to find better prices. Over half of the respondents said they held crypto wallets on multiple domestic crypto exchanges . Seven out of 10 said they have traded on the market-leading trading platform Upbit. Trading volumes on the Upbit crypto exchange over the past three months. (Source: CoinGecko) The majority of crypto-trading survey participants (60%) said they began investing in crypto in earnest during the 2020 Bitcoin bull run. Three-quarters of investors began investing with stakes worth less than 3 million won ($2,203). However, the value of their collective investments appears to have risen considerably. Over four in 10 of the crypto investors said they currently have coins worth more than 10 million won ($7,344) in their wallets. Majority of Traders Are Male Office Workers, Data Shows Most crypto investors were aged 40-49, with 67% of male respondents and just 33% of women saying they had bought coins. The majority of crypto investors (over half) said they were in white collar office jobs, with just 12% of physical laborers saying they had crypto holdings. The data also indicated that crypto investing-South Koreans tend to take more risks in the financial markets. The researchers noted that 38% of respondents showed signs of taking an “active” or “aggressive” approach to investment tendency. This, they said, was twice the overall average of 20%. The research institute explained: “Investors who have tried and experienced virtual asset investment even once had a higher aggressive investment tendency than investors who have no experience with crypto.” The top eight coins on the Bithumb platform by trading volumes over the past 24 hours. (Source: CoinGecko) Stablecoin Spike The findings appear to correlate with recent reports of a large spike in USD-pegged stablecoin and kimchi coin trading . Investment in coins like USDT has risen sharply in South Korea this year. And after the June 3 election of President Lee Jae-myung, speculative buying in stablecoin-related tokens has also seen an uptick. Lee has pledged to launch a won-pegged stablecoin and allow domestic firms to create stablecoin-powered payment platforms.

2025-06-29T22:51:40,"Bitcoin Jumps After Trump Says Growth Will Offset Deficits, Boosting Bull Case for BTC and Gold","Bitcoin (BTC) BTC traded at $107,937 as of 22:22 UTC on Sunday, up 0.54% over the past 24 hours, as attention turned to fiscal policy tensions in Washington following President Trump's latest post on Truth Social. Price action remained volatile, with BTC fluctuating between $107,194 and $108,489 during the 24-hour window, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. On June 29, 2025, President Donald Trump posted a pointed message on Truth Social addressing Republican lawmakers amid intense debate over his sweeping tax-and-spending package. “For all cost cutting Republicans, of which I am one, REMEMBER, you still have to get reelected. Don’t go too crazy! We will make it all up, times 10, with GROWTH, more than ever before,” he wrote. This statement underscores the deep divisions within the GOP as it wrestles with the ambitious legislation dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill.” The bill, exceeding 900 pages, combines roughly $3.8 trillion in tax cuts with targeted spending reductions and increased funding for defense and border security. It seeks to make permanent many of the tax breaks from Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including eliminating taxes on tips, overtime pay, and certain auto loans. The child tax credit would rise to $2,200 under the Senate version, while deductions for seniors would increase temporarily. However, to offset these tax cuts, Republicans propose significant cuts to Medicaid and nutrition programs, sparking fierce debate within the party. Moderate Republicans from high-tax states are pushing for a higher cap on state and local tax deductions (SALT), while conservatives demand deeper spending cuts, particularly targeting Medicaid. These internal disagreements complicate efforts to secure the narrow Republican majorities needed in both chambers to pass the bill, which Democrats uniformly oppose as favoring the wealthy and worsening inequality. Trump’s social media message reflects an attempt to balance these competing pressures — urging fiscal restraint to satisfy conservatives while emphasizing that robust economic growth will compensate for revenue losses and help reduce deficits over time. This supply-side economic approach projects that growth will “make it all up” despite near-term increases in the national debt, which nonpartisan analysts estimate could add trillions to the existing $36.2 trillion debt. Crypto analyst Will Clemente’s reaction on X (formerly Twitter) shortly after Trump’s post captures a common market sentiment: “How can you read this and hold long term US treasuries at current yields lol... Also, how can you read this and not hold any Bitcoin or gold.” Clemente’s skepticism toward long-term U.S. Treasuries reflects concerns that the bill’s deficit-financed tax cuts and modest spending cuts signal a loose fiscal policy that could fuel inflation and currency debasement. In this context, traditional fixed-income assets like Treasuries may appear less attractive, as rising deficits and potential monetary accommodation threaten bond values. Conversely, hard assets such as gold and Bitcoin are increasingly viewed as stores of value and hedges against inflation and fiscal risk. The expectation of sustained deficits and political challenges to fiscal discipline bolster demand for these inflation-resistant assets. With the Senate racing to finalize the bill before the July 4 holiday, Trump’s call for unity and moderation highlights the high stakes and political challenges in passing one of the most consequential fiscal packages in recent U.S. history. The bill’s fate remains uncertain as lawmakers negotiate to balance tax relief, spending cuts, and political feasibility. Technical Analysis Highlights From June 28 15:00 to June 29 14:00 UTC, BTC traded from $107,194 to $108,489, a 1.21% intraday range. Support was established at $107,300, with multiple rebounds during the 02:00–03:00 window. Volume peaked at 7,538 BTC between 08:00 and 11:00 UTC on June 29, confirming upward momentum. During the final session hour (13:05–14:04 UTC), BTC fell from $108,219 to $108,059, forming a descending channel. A 130 BTC volume spike at 13:35 coincided with a sharp dip to $108,030, which was tested and held. Final intraday rally pushed price back toward $108K before fading slightly by 22:22 UTC to $107,937.

2025-06-29T22:00:47,"Cathie Wood Says New Mortgage Rule May Benefit Crypto","Cathie Wood, leader of Ark Invest, has publicly endorsed a proposal from the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). The housing agency is considering a new rule that could allow people to use Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies when applying for home loans. Bitcoin May Soon Be Used in Mortgage Applications This change could help many crypto holders qualify for mortgages without having to convert their digital money into physical cash. The proposal has caught the attention of top financial leaders, including Strategy’s Chairman, Michael Saylor. She believes this proposal, if approved, could give the digital asset a bigger role in the U.S. financial system. Under the current system, banks typically verify a person’s income, employment status, and credit history before approving a mortgage. This can be a problem for individuals who own a significant amount of cryptocurrency but do not have a steady income or a regular job. This is because banks have not widely accepted digital assets as tangible proof of wealth. The FHFA’s proposal is set to change that. The new rule would allow crypto holders to use their digital assets as part of their loan application. This means they might not need to sell their Bitcoin to prove they can afford a home. Cathie Wood and Michael Saylor Weigh In Cathie Wood supported the idea, saying it could help more people become homeowners and increase the acceptance of crypto in the economy. Michael Saylor, another big supporter of Bitcoin , agreed and said Bitcoin is not just a risky investment. He added that the digital coin is a strong store of value and a powerful tool for resisting authoritarian financial control . In his view, Bitcoin deserves the same recognition as traditional assets, such as cash or stocks. He added that home ownership should not be out of reach for people with Bitcoin holdings. This is especially important for early Bitcoin investors and individuals who earn in cryptocurrency but lack formal income documents. Bitcoin to See Mainstream Use Bill Pulte, the new Director of FHFA, also backed the proposal. In a recent X post , he stated that the housing agency will carefully examine how cryptocurrency can reflect a borrower’s financial strength. This signals a growing effort to bring digital assets into the core of everyday finance. Meanwhile, the United Wholesale Mortgage became the first mortgage company to accept cryptocurrency payments . However, the initiative was halted in 2021 due to ongoing regulatory uncertainty. Fast-forward to 2025, crypto-friendly policies are now gaining momentum across the country. This comes as President Donald Trump has shared his vision to make America the crypto capital of the world. If the FHFA’s proposed rule is implemented, it could also attract more banks and large companies to the crypto space. It would help make Bitcoin more than just an investment; it could become a real tool for building and securing wealth.

2025-06-29T21:13:09,"Bitcoin Mining Companies’ Revenues Are Falling, But They’re Not Selling – What Does This Mean Historically?","Cryptocurrency analytics company Alphractal has published a remarkable assessment of the Bitcoin mining industry. The report notes that miners are not selling their Bitcoin reserves despite facing historically low profitability. Total transaction fees paid on the Bitcoin network have fallen to their lowest levels since 2012. This is attributed to the fact that on-chain activity has been extremely low this cycle, severely reducing miner revenues. Despite the recent decrease in hash rate, there has been no adjustment to the network difficulty yet. This delay further narrows miners’ margins and delays the network from reaching balance. Related News: Tomorrow is a Critical Day for BNB - Here's What to Expect The Bitcoin network is experiencing the highest hash rate fluctuations in its history. This is believed to be due to some major mining operations shutting down their ASIC devices, with falling revenues and decreasing network demand being cited as the reasons. Despite the difficult mining conditions, the fact that miners have not yet sold their reserves is considered a positive sign. According to Alphractal, some mining pools may have scaled back their activities in line with the decline in global chain usage. With Bitcoin trading above $107,000, miners are thought to be reallocating hash power based on current demand. According to the analyst firm, in past cycles, miners typically sold during periods of rapid price appreciation and increased network activity. However, both elements are currently at low levels, suggesting that the market may be in a period of “adjustment” rather than “capitulation.” *This is not investment advice.

Fast forward to today, and the crypto world is asking one big question, what’s the next Bitcoin moment? Some say it won’t happen again. Others are pointing to a new contender that isn’t trying to replace Bitcoin, but elevate its legacy. That project is Bitcoin Solaris, and its explosive presale is already turning early believers into future legends. Bitcoin Was the Spark, But Now It’s About the Flame Let’s be honest, Bitcoin’s price might keep rising, but it’s no longer the coin that makes millionaires overnight. The original crypto asset has matured into a store of value, like digital gold. Safe? Sure. Fast returns? Not anymore. That’s why even long-time Bitcoin holders are now eyeing something different. Bitcoin Solaris doesn’t just offer a faster chain or better DeFi. It combines speed, scalability, and mining access into a wealth-generation engine designed for the modern crypto era. And early adopters are paying attention for a reason. What Makes Bitcoin Solaris So Different? Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is not another “altcoin” chasing hype. It’s a next-gen blockchain that fuses Bitcoin’s scarcity with Solana-style throughput, while adding real-world accessibility through mobile mining. Let’s break down what gives BTC-S its edge: 10,000 transactions per second and 2-second finality, made possible by a hybrid architecture A dual-layer blockchain featuring Proof of Work (PoW) for the base layer and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) for the Solaris Layer Advanced validator rotation to keep block production efficient and secure Smart contract support built with cross-chain bridges to expand DeFi use cases Energy-efficient mobile mining through the exciting release of the Solaris Nova app And yes, this is all backed by not one, but two independent audits. The Cyberscope and Freshcoins audits both verified the smart contract integrity of BTC-S, giving presale investors even more peace of mind. Smart Contracts at Lightning Speed See Why Developers Love BTC-S Tokenomics Built for the Long Run The way Bitcoin Solaris handles its token distribution reflects its deep understanding of scarcity, fairness, and community power. Its tokenomics model is as follows: 66.66% allocated to mining, released over 90 years 20% for presale participants 5% to liquidity pools 2% each for community rewards, marketing, staking incentives, and ecosystem development 0.33% reserved for team and advisors This structure ensures the vast majority of BTC-S ends up in the hands of real users, not insiders or whales. The Presale That’s Breaking All Records If you’ve been watching presale trends, you’ll know they usually fizzle fast. Not this one. Bitcoin Solaris is currently in the last day in phase 9 , with a price of $9, set to rise to $10 in the next phase. It’s heading for a $20 launch, promising 150% gains out the gate. With less than 5 weeks remaining, the momentum is getting louder: Over 12,800+ unique buyers More than $5.8 million raised One of the shortest, most viral presales in recent memory Make sure to use Trust Wallet or Metamask to claim your tokens after the presale ends. In addition, Bitcoin Solaris introduced daily mini games for holders for a chance to earn daily free prizes, checkout the full breakdown here. Mobile Mining and Wealth Made Simple The upcoming Solaris Nova app will allow users to earn BTC-S tokens directly from their phones. This isn’t fake mining. The energy-efficient algorithm is real, and results are tracked transparently. You can even simulate your rewards using the official mining calculator . This mobile-first approach removes the barrier to entry, making wealth generation accessible to anyone with a smartphone. And with the mining rewards backed by real chain mechanics, early users can stack coins daily without touching a traditional rig. Influencer Eyes Are on It Too Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just turning heads in chat rooms. It’s being talked about by some of the sharpest names in the space. For example, the Token Galaxy review dives into why this project’s fundamentals and architecture set it apart from the dozens of gimmick tokens launching every month. That same review also highlights the audited backing, the presale strength, and the growing buzz across platforms like the official Telegram and X . The Final Verdict Not every day offers the chance to make early-mover gains in a project that feels destined to last. Bitcoin Solaris combines the credibility of Bitcoin’s fixed-supply philosophy with the agility of modern blockchain architecture. With real mobile mining, a dual-consensus model, blazing-fast TPS, and a community-first token model, it’s no surprise investors are calling it the crypto presale of the decade. There may never be another Bitcoin. But Bitcoin Solaris just might create more millionaires than the original.

2025-06-29T20:32:46,"Bitcoin Miners HODL Through Worst Payout in a Year: CryptoQuant","Bitcoin may be struggling to rally past its all-time high of $112,000, but miners are going through a tougher time. They have recently recorded some of their worst paydays in history. On-chain data, including the Miner Profit/Loss Sustainability metric, analyzed by the market intelligence platform CryptoQuant, revealed that miner revenues have declined significantly. However, this has not triggered any form of panic selling among them. Miner Revenues Plummet According to the report , miners are the most underpaid they have been in a year. On June 22, daily revenues fell to a two-month low of $34 million due to lower transaction fees and the latest plunge in bitcoin’s (BTC) price. CryptoQuant said the figure is the lowest since April 20. While miner revenues remain low, the hashrate of the Bitcoin network has also declined slightly. This metric has plummeted 3.5% since June 16; while CryptoQuant sees this as a small drawdown, it is the largest plunge since July 2024. The Bitcoin network hashrate fell 8.4% in July 2024 as miner revenues dropped following the halving that slashed block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. Regardless of the low revenues, miner outflows have dropped, indicating that selling is still muted. Bitcoin transfers from miners to crypto exchanges have fallen from a daily peak of 23,000 BTC in February to about 6,000 BTC currently. CryptoQuant said miners are not selling as much as they used to because they are still enjoying 48% Net Unrealized Profit/Loss operating margins. Still Room for Growth Notably, miners have not recorded any days of extremely high flows to exchanges since February. In fact, large miners have been replenishing their reserves. CryptoQuant’s analysts found that miner addresses holding between 100 BTC and 1,000 BTC have expanded their collective holdings from 61,000 BTC on March 31 to 65,000 BTC currently. This is their highest level since November 2024, when reserves fell below 71,000 BTC after BTC rallied past $100,000 for the first time. The spike in reserves further solidifies the belief that there is no selling pressure from them at bitcoin’s current price levels. Additionally, miners from the Satoshi era have only sold 150 BTC so far this year, compared to roughly 10,000 BTC last year. This cohort of market participants often sells during strong rallies, indicating market tops. Since they have refrained from selling so far, it implies that BTC still has more room for growth.

According to the petition filed in the Federal Court for the Southern District of New York, the parties believe that extending the deadline will help “avoid unnecessary filing processes.” The prosecutor’s office agrees with the request. Lawyers stated that Kwon was ready, but that the extension would be beneficial due to the “productive discussions” between the parties. It was also reported that the requested postponement would not affect other court dates. Accordingly, the start date of the hearing is still scheduled for February 17, 2026.

During a hearing last week, Judge Paul Engelmayer hinted that the newly passed GENIUS Act could affect the course of the case. The GENIUS (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins) Act, which passed the US Senate on June 17, aims to regulate stablecoins for payment purposes.

2025-06-29T20:00:07,"Crypto Strategist Unveils Bitcoin Path to New All-Time High Next Month, Says Plenty of Liquidity To Trigger Run for Altcoins","A crypto analyst gaining traction for timely Bitcoin calls is outlining a scenario where BTC breaks free from sideways trading and surges to new all-time highs. Pseudonymous analyst Credible tells his 468,700 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin appears to be following an Elliott Wave (EW) pattern where BTC consolidates in the next few weeks before igniting a breakout rally toward the end of July. Elliott Wave theory is an advanced form of technical analysis that seeks to forecast future price movements by tracking crowd psychology, which often unfolds in recurring wave patterns. Says Credible, “BTC holding up very well over the last few days. As stated in my last update, I think we will test the blue zone sooner or later, whether that be before or after taking our local range highs. From an EW perspective, something like this would be ideal. Although there are, of course, a few different structures that we may see to complete this correction, structures that lead to a tighter compression before expansion are always preferred because a substantial decrease in volatility/compression usually leads to a stronger breakout after. Focus should remain on key levels (blue zone and range highs) in terms of areas of interest.” Source: Credible/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that Bitcoin will briefly rally above $110,000 before pulling back to the $100,000 level to gear up for a breakout surge. As for the altcoin market, Credible thinks that alts will witness huge upside bursts despite concerns about liquidity sources. According to the analyst, crypto investors had the same liquidity worry about Bitcoin when it was trading below $30,000, and now BTC is worth $107,417. “Stop worrying about ‘where the liquidity will come from’ for alts. At this stage, crypto is like a teardrop in the ocean – there is plenty of liquidity out there.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Bitcoin price prediction June 2025 Bitcoin’s Q1 2025 performance was notably weak, with a 12.5% loss, as per CoinGlass data, marking the worst first quarter since 2018. However, it made a strong comeback in Q2 as in the last few weeks of May, the price of Bitcoin made a new ATH at $111,970. Will Bitcoin continue its upward rally in June? Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $105,000 and be pushed further, at least $113,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $97,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction June 2025 $97,000 $105,000 $113,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history | Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections.

2025-06-29T19:05:08,"Latest Report on Cryptocurrency Owners in South Korea Released – Major Changes Are Underway, Here Are the Trends","The “2050 Generation Virtual Asset Investment Trends Report” published by Hana Financial Research Institute revealed that virtual asset investment in South Korea has become a serious financial asset rather than a speculative tool. According to the report, 27% of individuals between the ages of 20 and 50 invest in cryptocurrencies, and these investments constitute an average of 14% of their total financial assets. The research is based on survey results conducted with 1,000 people. The crypto ownership rate is at its highest level, with 31% among individuals in their 40s. 70% of investors state that they plan to increase their crypto investments in the future. Another noteworthy piece of data from the report is that more than half of investors in their 50s are holding crypto for retirement preparation. 78% of this age group stated that they invested in virtual assets for the purpose of creating large savings, and 53% directly for old age preparation. Related News: A Turning Point for Cryptocurrencies: Solana and Ethereum ETFs with Staking Could Soon Begin Trading While 79% of investors use crypto to “grow money,” only 24% say they invest for “fashion and entertainment,” and 22% say they invest for “daily living expenses.” This suggests that crypto is now being viewed as a serious portfolio asset. Behaviors towards crypto investments are also maturing. The proportion of regular investors increased from 10% to 34%, while the proportion of medium-term investors increased from 26% to 47%. The proportion of short-term investors decreased from 48% to 45%. While 90% of investors stated that they only hold coins, interest in new generation digital assets such as NFTs and security tokens remained low. 60% of investors who hold an average of two different coins include Bitcoin in their portfolios. Initially focused on Bitcoin, investment strategies have expanded over time with altcoin and stablecoin diversity. The biggest complaint from investors was the inability to establish a connection between exchanges and existing bank accounts. Under the current system, exchanges can only be assigned a single bank account. 70% of participants said they would prefer their main bank if this restriction was lifted. Market volatility (56%), stock market risk (61%) and fraud concerns (61%) still significantly influence investment decisions. However, investors see the more active role of traditional financial institutions (42%) and increased regulation (35%) as positive steps. *This is not investment advice.
