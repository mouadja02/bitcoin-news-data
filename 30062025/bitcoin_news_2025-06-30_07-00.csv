The company issued an update on June 29 via X, outlining a phased recovery process starting with verified users. According to the statement, only spot wallets are being unlocked initially, with other wallet types to follow once identity verification is completed. Users are being asked to wait for confirmation before attempting to access their balances, which will be displayed gradually as the security checks proceed. Follow- up on Nobitex Security Incident, Step-by-step wallet access has begun, 29 June 2025 Please note: 1. This process is being carried out gradually, starting with verified users and initially for spot wallets, followed by other types of wallets. 2. The identity… — Nobitex | نوبیتکس (@nobitexmarket) June 29, 2025 “Once the accuracy and security of all information is confirmed, Nobitex will begin displaying wallet balances in phases,” the exchange wrote. Nobitex expects the process to finish by mid-week but noted that timelines could shift based on technical and security considerations. The exploit , carried out on June 18, was claimed by Gonjeshke Darande, a pro-Israel group also known as Predatory Sparrow. Blockchain investigators say roughly $90–100 million in digital assets were drained from hot wallets across Ethereum ( ETH ) and Tron ( TRX ), including Bitcoin ( BTC ), ETH, and Dogecoin ( DOGE ).

The firm warned users not to deposit funds into previously used addresses, noting that any deposits to old wallets may result in permanent loss. “If your old deposit address is connected to a mining rig or saved as a default withdrawal address in a blockchain service, make sure to delete it an,” the update advised, stressing the risk of sending funds to invalid wallets. The hackers reportedly accessed the platform using employee credentials compromised earlier via infostealer malware. The breach exposed parts of Nobitex’s internal systems, including source code and server data, which were later leaked online. Nobitex, which has processed more than $11 billion in inflows to date, holds a dominant position among Iran-based exchanges. Chainalysis has previously linked it to illicit activities by ransomware groups affiliated with Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and sanctioned Russian entities. With user access gradually resuming and trading features still disabled, the exchange is working to stabilize operations and restore trust. “We are working to resume withdrawal, deposit, and trading services for verified users with minimal delay,” the exchange said. Full platform functionality is expected to return in the coming days, though Nobitex has warned that the timeline may be revised depending on the results of ongoing system checks.

2025-06-30T04:30:30,"Best Crypto Presales for 2025: Experts Select Top New Cryptocurrencies for High Potential Returns","As Bitcoin approaches $108,000 and altcoins regain strength on the back of ETF momentum, institutional flows, and regulatory optimism, presale tokens are emerging as key opportunities for investors seeking outsized gains. Analysts are pointing to a mix of politically charged meme tokens, high-speed Layer-2s, and payment solutions as the top crypto bets of the second half of 2025. Here are the six presales experts are watching closely: MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGAFINANCE) Positioned as the political meme coin of 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing early interest with bold branding and rapid momentum. Analysts note that it has already become a focus for high-risk, high-reward traders looking for aggressive ROI setups before broader market exposure. With a campaign-driven narrative and increasing mentions in early presale rankings, MAGACOIN FINANCE may be emerging as the cycle’s standout meme contender. Early investors and market analysts are closely tracking its high-volume interest and accelerated wallet activity. MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t aiming for utility—it’s engineered for attention, speculation, and potential fast-paced growth. In a market increasingly driven by narrative and emotion, this token appears designed to dominate headlines and trader sentiment as listings draw near. Qubetics ($TICS) Qubetics is positioning itself as a Layer-1 Web3 aggregator. It has raised over $18 million and confirmed a top-tier exchange listing. Its roadmap includes tools like a multi-chain wallet and tokenization marketplace, though some concerns remain around delivery timelines. Solaxy (SOLX) Solaxy is a Layer-2 solution for Solana with deflationary tokenomics and a $58 million presale. It launched in late June 2025 with cross-chain capabilities and high staking APYs, but transparency issues and future execution are under watch. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) Bitcoin Hyper brings Solana-like speed to a Bitcoin-secured network, using SVM for scaling. With audit clearance and a Q3 2025 launch, HYPER is drawing some attention—but still early-stage. BTC Bull ($BTCBULL) BTC Bull ties its meme token value to Bitcoin price milestones, triggering burns and rewards. Backed by community hype and a bullish BTC trend, it’s speculative but may benefit from macro momentum. Remittix (RTX) Remittix offers crypto-to-fiat remittance infrastructure with flat fees and multi-currency support. It’s raised over $15 million and targets financial utility, though competition in PayFi remains high. Final Words While multiple presales are gaining attention in 2025, none are commanding momentum quite like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Built for speed, speculation, and cultural virality, it’s leading the charge as the token most likely to deliver outsized returns this cycle. Traders hunting for the next 50x or 100x return are increasingly viewing MAGACOIN FINANCE as more than a meme—it’s becoming a cultural signal in 2025’s crypto cycle. With listing anticipation building and retail FOMO increasing, experts suggest this could be the year MAGACOIN FINANCE dominates presale performance charts. As other projects navigate roadmaps and utility narratives, MAGACOIN FINANCE is already turning heads with raw buyer interest and breakout potential. For traders seeking pure upside in a hype-driven market, this is the name to watch.

Insiders Offload $13.6M With No Buying On June 18, Phong Le disposed of 8,400 shares of Class A stock, though he still holds over 16,000 shares, plus 10,500 in preferred shares across two series.

2025-06-30T03:49:13,"XRP Price Prediction For June 30","The post XRP Price Prediction For June 30 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP’s price action has been volatile over the past week, and right now, it’s testing a resistance level around the $2.19 to $2.20 mark. This level has proven difficult for XRP to break in recent days, with the token getting rejected each time it approaches this zone. A confirmed move above $2.20, with prices holding steadily, could open the door for a rally toward the next target around $2.25. The next resistance area sits between $2.30 and $2.35. Support Zones to Watch On the downside, XRP has strong support levels between $2.10 and $2.07. If prices drop, these levels are expected to attract buying interest and potentially stabilize the market. As of now, XRP seems to be trading sideways within this range, showing no clear breakout in either direction. A Market Moving with Bitcoin XRP’s next big move could depend heavily on what Bitcoin does next. If Bitcoin struggles to break through its own resistance levels, altcoins like XRP could follow a similar path, staying range-bound for a little longer. On the other hand, if Bitcoin makes a strong breakout, it might give XRP the momentum it needs to move higher. Long-Term Outlook Still Positive Looking at the bigger picture, XRP has been holding firm within a wider price channel for several months. While the short-term trend appears neutral, the long-term setup remains bullish as long as prices stay above key support levels. On the bullish side, XRP now has over 7.1 million wallets.. The price may be taking a short break, but another big move could be coming soon. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.19.

2025-06-30T03:30:54,"IRS Intensifies Scrutiny Of Crypto With Surge In Warning Letters","As crypto prices see a new rebound with Bitcoin (BTC) leading the pack, US investors are not only anticipating significant returns on BTC and other digital assets but also facing increased scrutiny from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Recent reports indicate that the Internal Revenue Service has dispatched a wave of warning letters to crypto investors, raising alarms about the accuracy of the information they provided on their tax returns. Crypto Tax Inquiries Skyrocket In the past two months, the number of these warning letters has spiked, signaling a renewed focus on digital asset reporting. Crypto tax experts have noted that this uptick is markedly higher than in previous years. David Kemmerer, co-founder and CEO of CoinLedger, reported a dramatic increase in support inquiries related to IRS communications . From May to June, conversations on CoinLedger about “IRS letters” surged to nearly 800, a ninefold increase compared to the same timeframe in 2024. Kemmerer explained, “Thousands of investors are getting these letters. Naturally, when that happens, we see a flood of customers coming to us asking, ‘What do I do?’” This sentiment is echoed by two crypto tax attorneys, Jordan Bass and Andrew Gordon, who have also observed a noticeable rise in inquiries regarding these IRS notifications. Bass mentioned that his firm received inquiries from at least ten recipients of the letters in the last two months, a significant increase from the previous year when no inquiries were reported. IRS Warning Letters The IRS has a history of intensifying its efforts to ensure compliance among cryptocurrency investors. Following the agency’s acquisition of thousands of customer records from Coinbase in 2017, it implemented a series of “voluntary compliance” letters aimed at encouraging accurate reporting among investors. The latest notices inform recipients that the Internal Revenue Service possesses information indicating they hold “one or more accounts containing virtual currency.” While some letters advise recipients to review their reporting for accuracy, others require a response, either through amended returns or explanations justifying their reported transactions. Interestingly, Gordon noted a potential commonality among recent recipients of the letters, many of whom had accounts on the Seychelles-based crypto exchange Poloniex , raising questions about the data the IRS may have accessed to trigger these communications. Kemmerer speculated that the increased outreach from the IRS typically follows the agency acquiring new data, suggesting that the notices might be part of broader enforcement efforts. “I’m sure there are just people randomly getting selected, and the lucky ones get these scary letters,” he said.

2025-06-30T03:30:33,"Bitcoin Price Surges Above $108,000: Analyst Predicts Potential Breakout To $150,000","The Bitcoin price has recently climbed back above the $108,000 mark, yet it struggles to surpass its current record of $111,800, creating a sense of uncertainty in the market. This persistent inability to break through has characterized the cryptocurrency’s performance in recent weeks, leaving analysts to speculate on its next moves. Analyst Predicts Major Upswing Crypto analyst Doctor Profit has outlined two potential scenarios for the Bitcoin price trajectory in the near term, offering insights into both immediate volatility and a long-term bullish outlook. In a recent post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Doctor Profit emphasized the significance of the current market conditions, suggesting that Bitcoin could reach between $120,000 and $150,000 in the coming months. Related Reading: Dogecoin Silent Build-Up: Double Bottom Hints At Explosive Move To $0.47 According to Doctor Profit, the market is poised for a breakout. He noted, “We’re standing in front of a breakout, one that has the potential to send Bitcoin into the $120,000–$150,000 zone over the next few months.” This assertion is supported by data reflecting strong on-chain activity, favorable technical structures, liquidity flow, and macroeconomic factors. While the long-term outlook appears promising, he cautioned that short-term fluctuations will remain prevalent. Two Scenarios For The Bitcoin Price Doctor Profit outlined two primary outcomes that traders should consider. The first scenario involves a bullish breakout from a bull flag pattern, allowing Bitcoin to surge past the $113,000 resistance level and continue climbing without a pullback. However, the analyst views this scenario as overly simplistic, suggesting that market makers typically prefer not to allow such parabolic moves to occur without a preceding shakeout. The second scenario, which appears more likely, involves either a rejection at the bull flag breakout or a liquidity grab at the $113,000 mark. This would potentially lead Bitcoin to revisit the lower boundary of the current range, around $90,000 to $93,000. Doctor Profit noted that this region is attractive because it contains significant liquidity and a notable gap in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) futures market. He views a dip to these levels not as a bearish signal, but rather as an opportunity to accumulate more Bitcoin. In his analysis, he stated, “$93K is not bearish. It’s clearly a gift!.” Doctor Profit believes that this potential dip would not only reset market leverage but also shake out weaker hands, creating a more robust foundation for a subsequent rally. Macroeconomic Trends Favor BTC Looking at the long-term prospects, Doctor Profit highlighted that larger wallets continue to accumulate Bitcoin, indicating that major investors are positioning themselves for a significant upward movement. He pointed to macroeconomic indicators, particularly the M2 money supply, which suggests that Bitcoin remains undervalued relative to broader economic trends. Related Reading: TD Sequential Flashes Buy: Dogecoin Ready For Rebound To $0.21 Notably, the Bitcoin price has been trading within its current range for 226 days, which echoes patterns observed during previous accumulation phases before major price breakouts. As Doctor Profit concluded, the Bitcoin price trajectory remains optimistic, with expectations of reaching between $120,000 and $150,000 in the foreseeable future. He notes that while there are multiple paths to achieving this target, a dip into the $90,000 to $93,000 range would provide a crucial opportunity for accumulation and set the stage for a powerful upward move.

2025-06-30T02:24:54,"Projected XRP Price If It Reclaims Half of Its Peak Market Dominance","As the total cryptocurrency market capitalization exceeds $3.28 trillion, discussions have resurfaced around XRP’s underperformance relative to other major assets. Despite its early presence and significant impact during previous market cycles, XRP has not mirrored the broader growth seen across the crypto sector over the past decade. Analysts suggest that even a partial recovery of its past market dominance could trigger a significant price increase. XRP’s Lagging Growth Compared to the Market Over the last ten years, the global cryptocurrency market has surged from $4.28 billion to over $3.28 trillion, a staggering 76,528% increase. Bitcoin and several altcoins have grown in parallel with this expansion, recording gains that align with or exceed the market’s pace. XRP, however, has not followed this trend. A key factor limiting XRP’s growth has been ongoing regulatory challenges, most notably its legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These issues led to temporary delistings from major exchanges, restricting access for U.S.-based investors and stalling momentum during critical growth periods. Historical Market Dominance: XRP vs. Bitcoin In May 2017, XRP reached its peak market dominance of 31.33%, supported by a market capitalization of $15.28 billion when the total crypto market was $48.78 billion. At the same time, Bitcoin’s market cap stood at $29 billion, giving it a 59.45% share of the total market. Since then, Bitcoin has grown in line with the market. Its capitalization has risen to $2.132 trillion, a 7,251% increase from 2017. XRP, on the other hand, has climbed only 743% during the same period, reaching a market cap of $128.8 billion. Consequently, XRP’s market dominance has dropped from 31.33% to just 3.96%, while Bitcoin’s has increased to 65.75%. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Price Projections Based on Reclaiming Market Share Given the current crypto market cap of $3.28 trillion, analysts have explored hypothetical scenarios in which XRP regains a portion of its former dominance. If XRP were to recover just half of its 2017 market dominance, 15.665%, its market capitalization would rise to approximately $513.8 billion. With the circulating supply of XRP estimated at 59 billion tokens, this would result in a price of roughly $8.70 per coin. Notably, this aligns with predictions made by industry figures such as George Tung, who has suggested that XRP could realistically reach $8 to $10 under favourable conditions by the end of the year. While some commentators see $8 as a significant target, others argue that it still undervalues XRP’s full potential, especially given its historical market standing. What If XRP Fully Recovers Its Past Dominance? In a more aggressive scenario, where XRP returns to its full 31.33% dominance, its market capitalization would exceed $1.027 trillion at the current overall market valuation. Based on the existing supply, this would drive the price of one XRP token to approximately $17.40 . Although achieving such a market share would require a significant shift in investor sentiment and regulatory clarity, the figures suggest that substantial upside remains possible, even if XRP only partially regains its historical position. XRP’s current valuation appears modest when measured against its historical performance and the broader market’s growth. A return to just half of its peak market dominance would more than quadruple its current price, while a full recovery could propel XRP to levels not previously reached. These scenarios, although hypothetical, provide a framework for evaluating XRP’s long-term potential in a maturing cryptocurrency market.

2025-06-30T02:04:53,"Spanish Coffee Chain Vanadi approves €1B Bitcoin bet","The board of directors of Vanadi Coffee, a publicly traded coffee chain headquartered in Alicante, Spain, has just signed off on a plan to see the company invest up to €1 billion — roughly $1.17 billion — in Bitcoin. The move , approved by shareholders on June 29, signals a significant departure of the company from previous financial policies , pushing it to the vanguard of corporate adoption of Bitcoin in Spain. A new solution for Bitcoin adherents, the firm has so far purchased 54 BTC, worth around €5.8 million at current prices, and is also eyeing wider expansions. In a recent filing with BME Growth — Spain’s growth division for small- and medium-sized enterprises — Vanadi hinted that they wished to become the largest business holder of Bitcoin in Spain. Vanadi’s stock price went parabolic following the company’s Bitcoin play, increasing more than threefold in June. The increase marks an apparent increase in investor appetite for companies leveraging digital assets as a treasury strategy . Vanadi had said in its translated announcement: “Similar to companies such as Strategy or Metaplanet, Vanadi Coffee redefines its business model and will use Bitcoin as its main reserve asset and accumulate large amounts of Bitcoin as part of its treasury.” The company is looking to replicate the high-wager Bitcoin treasury models of Strategy, which holds over 200,000 BTC, and Metaplanet. The Japanese firm has recently tweaked its balance sheet policy to the pro-Bitcoin side. Vanadi struggles to recover with a Bitcoin bet Vanadi’s had been struggling financially and operationally; its 2024 financial statement lists that it was operating at a loss of €3.3m, an increase of 15.8% from the previous period. Competition and operating costs have eaten away at profitability bit by bit as the cost of coffee has risen ever higher, dragging the firm further into financial strain. Meanwhile, Vanadi was looking for more money to build long-term. It received two large investment offers in May. One was from a tiny local software consultancy, a one-man outfit in Alicante, and he offered 50 million euros. The other was Alpha Blue Ocean, an international firm that announced it would back 15 companies in 15 countries with over €1.5 billion in investment. Critics raise concerns over Vanadi’s ambitious Bitcoin move Vanadi’s daring foray into Bitcoin is not risk-free. The company has a handful of stores serving espresso and pastries, and it is now dipping a toe in the complex world of crypto treasury management. But analysts and sceptics have raised red flags. They also note that Vanadi’s small size, slim operating margins and inexperience in crypto could be left open to volatility and then to scrutiny by regulators. Unlike Strategy, whose tech-focused leadership team has many years of experience navigating capital markets, Vanadi’s management has a steep learning curve ahead. And the regulatory climate for digital assets in Spain is also conservative. It’s not part of an activist group, but it is dynamic, and screwing any of this up in compliance or implementation would be expensive. Vanadi is not alone, though. Companies worldwide are adding Bitcoin to their treasury, which is becoming a trend. US-based crypto firm Bakkt recently revealed its intentions to purchase as much as $1 billion of Bitcoin. Tesla and Coinbase are among the companies that have pursued comparable treasury strategies. What sets Vanadi apart, however, is the scale of its ambition relative to its core business. A €1 billion Bitcoin bet on a café chain with six locations and persistent losses is an aggressive bet by any measure.

S token price has crashed to $0.3233, down by 67% from its highest point this year. Sonic token unlocks ahead Andre Cronje’s Sonic token will be in the spotlight this week as it unlocks millions of tokens. DeFi Llama data shows that the network will unlock tokens worth $76 million, representing about 7.45% of the float on Friday. Sonic has a circulating supply of 2.88 billion tokens against a total supply of 3.17 billion. This means that holders can expect more unlocks in the coming years, with the next scheduled one happening on July 5 next year. A token unlock is often seen as a bearish thing for a token because it increases the circulating supply. Higher supply and low demand often leads to more token downside. Additionally, more token supply often impacts the staking yield since many investors move their coins to staking pools. The token unlock will happen a week after Sonic Labs opened the entire S airdrop to US residents . Read more: Sonic SVM introduces Attention Capital Market to monetize digital attention DeFi and stablecoin volumes are falling Sonic price is at risk as its decentralized finance network deteriorates. Data shows that the total value locked (TVL) in this network has been in a strong downtrend in the past few months, signaling that the momentum it had earlier this year has faded. Sonic has a total value locked (TVL) of $1.14 billion, down from $1.9 billion earlier this year. Most dApps in its ecosystem like Aave, Beets, Silo Finance, Pendle, and Stablity have shed substantial assets in the last 30 days. This is a big reversal from what happened a few months ago when Sonic was one of the fastest-growing chains, with its TVL jumping from $74 million in January to over $1.14 billion. More data reveals that the volume of stablecoins handled in the Sonic blockchain has crashed this month. After soaring to $4.21 billion in May, the amount dropped to $2.05 billion this month. Shadow Exchange handled over $1.17 billion in the last 30 days, while SwapX, Beets, and XPress Protocol handled $246m, $150m, and $149m. Another top data shows that Sonic’s stablecoin ecosystem remains under pressure. Per Artemis , the number of Sonic’s stablecoin addresses has crashed by 100% in the last 30 days to over 41,000. Similarly, the stablecoin supply in the network has plunged by 27% to $328 million, while the number of transactions fell by 100% in the last 30 days to 9.2 million, Sonic’s adjusted stablecoin transactions also plunged to $19.6 billion. This is a major red flag because stablecoins have become the fastest-growing sectors in the crypto industry.

2025-06-30T00:00:15,"Best-Selling Author Ric Edelman Drastically Changes Crypto Investment Strategy – Here’s His New Stance: Report","The influential financial advisor who wrote the 2021 book “The Truth about Crypto” is reportedly increasing his recommended investment allocation for crypto. CNBC reports that Ric Edelman, who previously said that allocating as much as 1% to crypto was reasonable, is now saying that financial advisors should recommend allocating between 10% and 40% to digital assets. Says Edelman in an interview with CNBC’s Crypto World, “Today I am saying 40%, that’s astonishing. No one has ever said such a thing.” The founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals is now more bullish on crypto assets amid the massive changes in the industry. According to Edelman, Bitcoin and the broader crypto space faced numerous uncertainties four years ago – from the possibility of government bans on BTC , to concerns about blockchain technology becoming obsolete, to questions about whether digital asset adoption would gain meaningful traction. “Today, all those questions have been resolved. It’s radically changed and is now a mainstream asset.” Edelman also says that Bitcoin and crypto should play a bigger role in long-term investment strategies as life expectancy in the US increases. According to the financial advisor, allocating 60% in stocks and 40% in bonds no longer works, given that Americans can live up to 85 today, or even much older with advances in tech and medicine. “If you’re a financial advisor and you had a 30-year-old client who was saving for their long-term future, you would tell them to put 100% of their money in stocks, because they have 50 years to go. Today’s 60-year-old is kind of like yesterday’s 30-year-old. You need to get better returns than you can get from bonds, and you need to hold equities longer than ever before.” Edelman notes that Bitcoin is a great portfolio diversifier as it doesn’t appear to be correlated with the performance of other asset classes. He also says that digital assets tend to outperform stocks, bonds, gold and others. “Bitcoin prices don’t move in sync with stocks or bonds or gold or oil or commodities… The crypto asset class offers the opportunity for higher returns than you’re likely to get in virtually any other asset class.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-29T23:43:55,"Crypto Cards Gain Ground Over Traditional Banks for Small Payments in Europe","Cryptocurrency-linked payment cards are rapidly gaining traction in Europe, particularly for small purchases typically dominated by cash. According to a new report from CEX.IO, 45% of crypto card transactions fall under the 10-euro mark, reflecting a shift in consumer behaviour and highlighting crypto’s growing role in day-to-day payments. The report, shared with Cointelegraph, noted a 15% year-on-year increase in newly issued CEX.IO crypto cards across the continent in 2025. This trend indicates a broader acceptance of digital assets as a means for routine purchases and suggests that crypto cardholders are now mirroring traditional banking habits, especially when it comes to online spending. Online Spending Nearly Doubles Traditional Usage Rates While the European Central Bank (ECB) reports that 21% of card payments in the eurozone are made online, CEX.IO data shows that 40% of crypto card transactions occur via the internet. This figure nearly doubles the regional average, showcasing the comfort crypto users have with digital platforms. “What we’re seeing in Europe is that crypto card users aren’t just experimenting with new tech — they’re showing us what everyday spending might look like in a truly cashless future,” said Alexandr Kerya, Vice President of Product Management at CEX.IO. He also revealed that average payment volumes have jumped 24% in the past month alone. Crypto Spending Patterns Mirror Traditional Banking The data further illustrates how crypto cardholders are incorporating digital currencies into their daily routines. Groceries represent 59% of crypto card purchases, which is close to the ECB’s 54% average for traditional bank cards. Spending at restaurants and bars accounts for 19% — a higher figure than typical bank card usage in that category. The average crypto card transaction stands at €23.70, lower than the €33.60 average for traditional bank card payments, based on Mastercard’s Q1 2025 data. Stablecoins Lead Transactions as Other Cryptos Gain Ground Stablecoins play a dominant role in these transactions, powering 73% of all crypto card activity. Nevertheless, other leading digital assets such as Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, and Solana are also being used for essentials like groceries, dining, and transport. This mirrors broader usage trends across the crypto sector. For example, platforms like Oobit and Crypto.com are also reporting strong transaction volumes related to everyday spending and online shopping across their European user base. Institutional Pushbacks Continue Despite Adoption Gains However, not all financial institutions are welcoming this trend. Barclays has announced that it will block crypto purchases on its Barclaycard credit cards. The bank cited concerns over the volatility of digital assets and the lack of consumer protections available through traditional financial mechanisms. Barclays emphasized that crypto transactions are not covered by the Financial Ombudsman Service or the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, leaving users exposed in case of disputes or losses. Despite such institutional caution, the momentum behind crypto card usage continues to grow, reflecting an evolving financial landscape that is increasingly embracing digital innovation.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/crypto-cards-gain-ground-over-traditional-banks-for-small-payments-in-europe/,"FIAT|BTC|LTC|REGULATION|SOL","Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|DeFi|Crypto Intelligence",cryptocompare

Stablecoins have regulatory clarity thanks to the GENIUS Act – and Ethereum is home to the most stablecoin deposits; ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continue to see sizable flow. Technical analysis by CoinDesk's analyst Omkar Godbole indicates a potential bullish case is forming on-chain, with traders increasingly viewing $ 3,000 ETH as a possibility in the near future. But behind the scenes, something more fundamental is happening. Ethereum’s validator architecture, the backbone of its proof-of-stake security model, is undergoing a quiet transformation that could cement ETH’s role as Wall Street’s favorite programmable asset. At the center of that shift is distributed validator technology, or DVT, a system that allows Ethereum validators to be split across multiple operators and machines, making them far more resilient, secure, and decentralized. Obol Labs is one of the leading teams behind the technology. “Ethereum is coming back in favor because it’s the most secure and battle-tested blockchain,” said Anthony Bertolino, head of ecosystem at Obol Labs. “And security comes from validators. The most advanced and secure ones now are distributed validators.” Obol’s technology eliminates a long-standing problem in Ethereum staking: single points of failure. Traditional validators rely on a single node to propose and attest to blocks. If that node goes offline or is misconfigured, the validator is penalized, or slashed in Ethereum parlance. Obol’s system uses threshold cryptography and an “active-active” architecture so that even if some nodes fail, the validator keeps running without interruption. This upgrade is not just a technical improvement. It is an institutional requirement. As Ethereum sees inflows from ETFs, funds, and structured finance products, staking infrastructure needs to meet the standards of traditional capital allocators. Blockdaemon, for instance, recently announced that it is integrating Obol's distributed validator technology into its staking infrastructure. Blockdaemon is a $100 billion name for institutional crypto. “Historically, institutions had to choose between performance and security,” Bertolino said. “Now they get both.” Momentum is building fast. Lido, Ethereum’s largest staking protocol with $22 billion in total value locked , is preparing to approve distributed validator use across its “Curated Set” — the collection of professional node operators who manage over 30 percent of all staked ETH. A new governance proposal would allow these operators to use either Obol or SSV in intra-operator setups, and eventually expand usage across thousands of validators. This move builds on the success of Lido’s Simple DVT Module, which has already deployed over 9,600 DVT-powered validators with a 97.5 percent effectiveness score, outperforming the network average. “These clusters are already showing better uptime, higher effectiveness, and similar yields to conventional setups,” Bertolino said. “This is the infrastructure shift that makes Ethereum staking enterprise-grade.” For Ethereum, the implications go beyond validator design. DVT mitigates one of the network’s core criticisms, that its staking layer is increasingly centralized, and helps fulfill the vision of Ethereum to be neutral, distributed infrastructure. ""Institutions are thinking about two things. How do I secure the assets, and how do I generate attractive yield? Historically, you had to choose one. DVT gives you both,” Bertolino said. And Wall Street continues to pay attention. News Recap: Short COIN, Long BTC as Coinbase Nears Overvaluation, Says 10x Research Coinbase shares have surged 84% in the past two months, far outpacing bitcoin’s 14% gain and raising red flags about overvaluation, according to 10x Research, covered late last week by CoinDesk . In a Friday note, Head of Research Markus Thielen recommended a short COIN/long BTC trade, arguing that Coinbase’s fundamentals—mainly trading volumes—don’t justify the rally. “While Coinbase hasn’t quite breached the +30% overvaluation threshold, it’s approaching fast,” Thielen wrote, suggesting options strategies or pair trades to exploit the potential reversal. 10x’s model finds 75% of COIN’s price action is tied to bitcoin’s price and volumes, meaning recent gains likely reflect excessive speculation. The report notes other bullish catalysts, including Circle’s IPO and U.S. stablecoin legislation, are likely priced in, while Korean investor momentum is fading. “This rare deviation suggests Coinbase’s valuation is extended and vulnerable to mean reversion,” Thielen said, warning that COIN could soon follow other overheated crypto stocks lower. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin is trading above $108K as Asia opens its trading week, but analyst Michaël van de Poppe says it must break $109K resistance to sustain momentum, with the rally fueled more by leveraged futures than spot demand. ETH: Ethereum broke above $2,440 with strong volume support, signaling bullish momentum amid new U.S. stock market highs, improving global liquidity, and easing geopolitical tensions. Gold: Gold is trading at $3,248.26, down slightly, as Australia cuts its commodity export earnings forecast due to weak iron ore and gas prices despite surging gold. Nikkei 225: Nikkei 225 futures are trending higher with an expectation that the White House will reach trade deals with Japan and other export-heavy Asian economies.

2025-06-29T23:30:00,"Over Half of South Koreans Have Crypto Trading Experience – Survey","More than half of South Koreans aged 20 to 59 have crypto trading experience, with one in four currently HODLing coins. The same survey found that current crypto owners say that tokens like Bitcoin (BTC) make up at least 14% of the total value of their financial assets. South Koreans: Crypto Trading on the Rise? The newspaper Cheonji Ilbo reported that the survey of 1,000 people nationwide was conducted in April this year by the Hana Financial Group’s Research Institute. South Korea called for a “mutually beneficial” agreement on trade with the US during its new trade minister’s first trip to Washington this week. https://t.co/qeMmYlICCy — Bloomberg (@business) June 28, 2025 The survey’s authors explained that 51% of the people they spoke to “had experience investing in crypto,” with 27% currently HODLing their coins. In this latter group, investors said they were holding onto an average of around 13 million won ($9,547) worth of coins. In the early stages of investment, the researchers found, traders tended to focus on Bitcoin. However, they also found that as traders gained experience, they tended to buy more altcoins, with a focus on stablecoins . Wallets on Multiple Exchanges The data also appears to indicate that many South Korean traders are prepared to shop around to find better prices. Over half of the respondents said they held crypto wallets on multiple domestic crypto exchanges . Seven out of 10 said they have traded on the market-leading trading platform Upbit. Trading volumes on the Upbit crypto exchange over the past three months. (Source: CoinGecko) The majority of crypto-trading survey participants (60%) said they began investing in crypto in earnest during the 2020 Bitcoin bull run. Three-quarters of investors began investing with stakes worth less than 3 million won ($2,203). However, the value of their collective investments appears to have risen considerably. Over four in 10 of the crypto investors said they currently have coins worth more than 10 million won ($7,344) in their wallets. Majority of Traders Are Male Office Workers, Data Shows Most crypto investors were aged 40-49, with 67% of male respondents and just 33% of women saying they had bought coins. The majority of crypto investors (over half) said they were in white collar office jobs, with just 12% of physical laborers saying they had crypto holdings. The data also indicated that crypto investing-South Koreans tend to take more risks in the financial markets. The researchers noted that 38% of respondents showed signs of taking an “active” or “aggressive” approach to investment tendency. This, they said, was twice the overall average of 20%. The research institute explained: “Investors who have tried and experienced virtual asset investment even once had a higher aggressive investment tendency than investors who have no experience with crypto.” The top eight coins on the Bithumb platform by trading volumes over the past 24 hours. (Source: CoinGecko) Stablecoin Spike The findings appear to correlate with recent reports of a large spike in USD-pegged stablecoin and kimchi coin trading . Investment in coins like USDT has risen sharply in South Korea this year. And after the June 3 election of President Lee Jae-myung, speculative buying in stablecoin-related tokens has also seen an uptick. Lee has pledged to launch a won-pegged stablecoin and allow domestic firms to create stablecoin-powered payment platforms.

2025-06-29T22:51:40,"Bitcoin Jumps After Trump Says Growth Will Offset Deficits, Boosting Bull Case for BTC and Gold","Bitcoin (BTC) BTC traded at $107,937 as of 22:22 UTC on Sunday, up 0.54% over the past 24 hours, as attention turned to fiscal policy tensions in Washington following President Trump's latest post on Truth Social. Price action remained volatile, with BTC fluctuating between $107,194 and $108,489 during the 24-hour window, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. On June 29, 2025, President Donald Trump posted a pointed message on Truth Social addressing Republican lawmakers amid intense debate over his sweeping tax-and-spending package. “For all cost cutting Republicans, of which I am one, REMEMBER, you still have to get reelected. Don’t go too crazy! We will make it all up, times 10, with GROWTH, more than ever before,” he wrote. This statement underscores the deep divisions within the GOP as it wrestles with the ambitious legislation dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill.” The bill, exceeding 900 pages, combines roughly $3.8 trillion in tax cuts with targeted spending reductions and increased funding for defense and border security. It seeks to make permanent many of the tax breaks from Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including eliminating taxes on tips, overtime pay, and certain auto loans. The child tax credit would rise to $2,200 under the Senate version, while deductions for seniors would increase temporarily. However, to offset these tax cuts, Republicans propose significant cuts to Medicaid and nutrition programs, sparking fierce debate within the party. Moderate Republicans from high-tax states are pushing for a higher cap on state and local tax deductions (SALT), while conservatives demand deeper spending cuts, particularly targeting Medicaid. These internal disagreements complicate efforts to secure the narrow Republican majorities needed in both chambers to pass the bill, which Democrats uniformly oppose as favoring the wealthy and worsening inequality. Trump’s social media message reflects an attempt to balance these competing pressures — urging fiscal restraint to satisfy conservatives while emphasizing that robust economic growth will compensate for revenue losses and help reduce deficits over time. This supply-side economic approach projects that growth will “make it all up” despite near-term increases in the national debt, which nonpartisan analysts estimate could add trillions to the existing $36.2 trillion debt. Crypto analyst Will Clemente’s reaction on X (formerly Twitter) shortly after Trump’s post captures a common market sentiment: “How can you read this and hold long term US treasuries at current yields lol... Also, how can you read this and not hold any Bitcoin or gold.” Clemente’s skepticism toward long-term U.S. Treasuries reflects concerns that the bill’s deficit-financed tax cuts and modest spending cuts signal a loose fiscal policy that could fuel inflation and currency debasement. In this context, traditional fixed-income assets like Treasuries may appear less attractive, as rising deficits and potential monetary accommodation threaten bond values. Conversely, hard assets such as gold and Bitcoin are increasingly viewed as stores of value and hedges against inflation and fiscal risk. The expectation of sustained deficits and political challenges to fiscal discipline bolster demand for these inflation-resistant assets. With the Senate racing to finalize the bill before the July 4 holiday, Trump’s call for unity and moderation highlights the high stakes and political challenges in passing one of the most consequential fiscal packages in recent U.S. history. The bill’s fate remains uncertain as lawmakers negotiate to balance tax relief, spending cuts, and political feasibility. Technical Analysis Highlights From June 28 15:00 to June 29 14:00 UTC, BTC traded from $107,194 to $108,489, a 1.21% intraday range. Support was established at $107,300, with multiple rebounds during the 02:00–03:00 window. Volume peaked at 7,538 BTC between 08:00 and 11:00 UTC on June 29, confirming upward momentum. During the final session hour (13:05–14:04 UTC), BTC fell from $108,219 to $108,059, forming a descending channel. A 130 BTC volume spike at 13:35 coincided with a sharp dip to $108,030, which was tested and held. Final intraday rally pushed price back toward $108K before fading slightly by 22:22 UTC to $107,937.

2025-06-29T22:00:47,"Cathie Wood Says New Mortgage Rule May Benefit Crypto","Cathie Wood, leader of Ark Invest, has publicly endorsed a proposal from the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). The housing agency is considering a new rule that could allow people to use Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies when applying for home loans. Bitcoin May Soon Be Used in Mortgage Applications This change could help many crypto holders qualify for mortgages without having to convert their digital money into physical cash. The proposal has caught the attention of top financial leaders, including Strategy’s Chairman, Michael Saylor. She believes this proposal, if approved, could give the digital asset a bigger role in the U.S. financial system. Under the current system, banks typically verify a person’s income, employment status, and credit history before approving a mortgage. This can be a problem for individuals who own a significant amount of cryptocurrency but do not have a steady income or a regular job. This is because banks have not widely accepted digital assets as tangible proof of wealth. The FHFA’s proposal is set to change that. The new rule would allow crypto holders to use their digital assets as part of their loan application. This means they might not need to sell their Bitcoin to prove they can afford a home. Cathie Wood and Michael Saylor Weigh In Cathie Wood supported the idea, saying it could help more people become homeowners and increase the acceptance of crypto in the economy. Michael Saylor, another big supporter of Bitcoin , agreed and said Bitcoin is not just a risky investment. He added that the digital coin is a strong store of value and a powerful tool for resisting authoritarian financial control . In his view, Bitcoin deserves the same recognition as traditional assets, such as cash or stocks. He added that home ownership should not be out of reach for people with Bitcoin holdings. This is especially important for early Bitcoin investors and individuals who earn in cryptocurrency but lack formal income documents. Bitcoin to See Mainstream Use Bill Pulte, the new Director of FHFA, also backed the proposal. In a recent X post , he stated that the housing agency will carefully examine how cryptocurrency can reflect a borrower’s financial strength. This signals a growing effort to bring digital assets into the core of everyday finance. Meanwhile, the United Wholesale Mortgage became the first mortgage company to accept cryptocurrency payments . However, the initiative was halted in 2021 due to ongoing regulatory uncertainty. Fast-forward to 2025, crypto-friendly policies are now gaining momentum across the country. This comes as President Donald Trump has shared his vision to make America the crypto capital of the world. If the FHFA’s proposed rule is implemented, it could also attract more banks and large companies to the crypto space. It would help make Bitcoin more than just an investment; it could become a real tool for building and securing wealth.
