2025-07-09T11:52:15,"Is the Bitcoin Bull Run Over or Just Getting Started?","The post Is the Bitcoin Bull Run Over or Just Getting Started? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin has been making people nervous lately. With price swings and multiple failed attempts to push past $112,000, many are wondering, is the bull run over? Are we entering another bear market? But, according to experienced crypto trader Mags, analysis suggests that Bitcoin may be preparing for another major rally. Bitcoin’s 50-WMA Hints at $130K Level In a recent tweet, Mags pointed out that Bitcoin’s 50-week moving average (50 WMA) has long acted as a strong support level. Whenever Bitcoin touched this line before, it often bounced back and moved higher. Mags’ chart highlights several historical “BUY” signals when Bitcoin touched the 50 WMA and later surged higher. The only “SELL” signal occurred back in early 2022, when BTC failed to hold above the moving average. Since then, the 50 WMA has continued to act as a strong support line. #Bitcoin – Bear market incoming? A lot of people think Bitcoin is heading into a bear market. The easiest way to check? Look at the 50 Weekly Moving Average. If you notice, the 50-week MA has been a strong support over the years.

On-chain Activity Points to Accumulation Adding to this perspective is some recent large-scale on-chain activity. According to crypto analyst Maartunn, over 19,400 BTC, worth around $2.11 billion, were recently moved out of dormant wallets into institutional-grade addresses. These coins had not been touched for three to seven years. Institutional Accumulation Incoming? Three large transactions hit the chain this morning, moving dormant coins into likely institutional wallets: • Tx 1 3y–5y: 8,002 BTC • Tx 2 3y–5y: 2,438 BTC 5y–7y: 6,000 BTC • Tx 3 5y–7y: 3,002 BTC In… pic.twitter.com/pGF4YFkxFb — Maartunn (@JA_Maartun) July 8, 2025 While such moves often hint at strategic selling, it suggests large investors might step in to buy while the price stays steady Short-Term Pressure Still Exists While everything isn’t just bullish yet.

2025-07-09T11:52:12,"Elon Musk’s Tesla Could Have Earned $17 Billion from Bitcoin, Here’s What Went Wrong","The post Elon Musk’s Tesla Could Have Earned $17 Billion from Bitcoin, Here’s What Went Wrong appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News What if Tesla never stopped accepting Bitcoin? According to Tomas Grief, Chief Product Officer at Brainns, the EV giant could have amassed 160,000 BTC, now worth over $17 billion — simply by accepting just 2% of its car sales in Bitcoin since 2021. That stash would now be nearly half of Tesla’s total profits since 2021. Tesla’s $17 Billion What-If Scenario On May 12, 2021, Elon Musk stunned the crypto world. In a now-famous tweet, the Tesla CEO announced the company would suspend accepting Bitcoin for vehicle purchases, citing environmental concerns: “ Cryptocurrency is a good idea on many levels… but this cannot come at great cost to the environment.” He added Tesla wouldn’t sell its BTC and would reconsider transactions when mining became more sustainable. Here’s What Could Have Happened If Tesla Kept Going In a post on X , Tomas Grief shared a mind-blowing projection: If just 2% of Tesla’s sales since 2021 had been in Bitcoin — and the company held onto the BTC — Tesla would now own around 160,000 BTC. On May 12, 2021 (the day Tesla paused BTC payments), Bitcoin was $56,667 In just 11 days, BTC dropped nearly 39% after the announcement Today, Bitcoin trades around $108,826, up 88.9% year-over-year That 160,000 BTC stash would now be worth over $17 billion To put it in perspective: Tesla has made about $40 billion in profits since 2021. That means their potential BTC stash would have equaled 42.5% of total profit. Why Tesla Paused Bitcoin Payments Musk’s decision came amid rising scrutiny of Bitcoin’s environmental impact: High energy consumption, mostly from fossil fuels Significant carbon emissions and electronic waste Concerns about water and land usage While Bitcoin mining is slowly shifting towards renewables, these sustainability issues remain unresolved, making the tech community divided on its long-term viability. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Is the Bitcoin Bull Run Over or Just Getting Started? , Could Tesla Reconsider Accepting Bitcoin?

2025-07-09T11:50:58,"Traders Eye $110K Bitcoin, but Santiment Warns of Overheated Optimism","Crypto traders are growing confident that Bitcoin could soon reclaim the $110,000 mark, but this rising optimism may not be as bullish as it appears, according to blockchain analytics platform Santiment. Analyst Brian Quinlivan highlighted that excessive retail enthusiasm often precedes local price tops, warning traders to exercise caution even as sentiment indicators flash green. “It’s pretty clear that the crowd is starting to salivate over a potential $110K+ Bitcoin market value,” Quinlivan stated . He explained that trader emotions can often lead to ill-timed decisions, with price action frequently moving against overly bullish retail sentiment. Bullish Sentiment Hits Three-Week High Santiment’s data shows that bullish comments on Bitcoin now outnumber bearish ones by a ratio of 1.51 to 1, the highest reading in the past three weeks. This spike in optimism mirrors previous instances that preceded price corrections, including the declines seen on June 11 and July 7 after similar sentiment surges. On Monday, Bitcoin briefly touched a local high of $109,595 before retracing to $107,681, coinciding with a wave of bullish commentary across social platforms. Quinlivan noted that this pattern aligns with retail investors “buying into the rising momentum” of Bitcoin’s price, which often results in short-term pullbacks. Despite the potential for a near-term correction, Bitcoin remains in an upward trend, currently trading near $108,000, up 2.84% over the past week, according to CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin Whale Inactivity Signals Market Caution Quinlivan also pointed out that Bitcoin whale wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 BTC have shown limited movement in recent days, a signal that may warrant caution. “For now, these wallets have been somewhat suspiciously flat,” he said, revealing that whales offloaded 14,140 BTC over the past week, indicating a pause in accumulation. Historically, whale accumulation often happen just before price increases, while periods of distribution or inactivity have signaled upcoming price declines across the crypto market. However, Quinlivan emphasized that the broader outlook remains bullish, with whales and sharks steadily accumulating Bitcoin over the past six months despite short-term market fluctuations. While traders remain eager for Bitcoin to reclaim its all-time high of $111,970 reached on May 22, Santiment suggests that a “mild pullback” could be healthy before a sustained move toward new highs, allowing market momentum to stabilize before the next major leg upward.

2025-07-09T11:50:22,"Bitcoin: Crucial Hesitation as Traders Await New Highs","Are you feeling the palpable tension in the air surrounding the cryptocurrency market? If you’re a crypto enthusiast or a seasoned investor, you’ve likely noticed a significant shift in recent weeks. The once-relentless upward trajectory of Bitcoin seems to have hit a snag, leaving many on the sidelines. This article delves deep into the reasons behind the current market pause, exploring why traders are hesitant to commit to new positions, particularly as the flagship cryptocurrency struggles to break new all-time highs. Understanding Bitcoin’s Current Standoff The cryptocurrency world thrives on momentum, and right now, Bitcoin appears to be in a crucial standoff. After a period of impressive gains, the leading digital asset has found itself consolidating, unable to muster the strength for a decisive push into uncharted territory. This lack of upward velocity is a primary driver of the current market apprehension. Investors who were once eager to ‘buy the dip’ are now questioning whether current price levels offer enough upside potential to justify the risk, especially without clear signals of a renewed bullish trend. Several factors contribute to this perceived lack of momentum: Failure to Secure New All-Time Highs: Each attempt to surpass previous peaks has been met with selling pressure, indicating strong resistance at those levels. Reduced Trading Volume: A noticeable decline in trading volume suggests that fewer participants are actively engaging in the market, leading to thinner order books. Absence of Fresh Capital Inflows: While institutional interest remains, the rate of new significant capital entering the market appears to have slowed, which is vital for sustained rallies. Why Are Crypto Traders Holding Back? The hesitation among Crypto Traders isn’t unfounded; it’s a rational response to prevailing market conditions. Seasoned traders understand that chasing a rally that lacks conviction can lead to significant losses. The current environment is characterized by a mix of profit-taking and a wait-and-see approach. Many who bought Bitcoin at lower prices are now opting to secure their gains, rather than risking them in an uncertain market. For those looking to enter, the absence of a clear breakout signal means that the risk-reward ratio doesn’t appear compelling enough. This cautious stance is influenced by: Profit-Taking Pressures: After substantial runs, it’s natural for investors to lock in profits, especially when the market shows signs of fatigue. Uncertainty Regarding Macro Factors: Global economic signals, inflation concerns, and central bank policies are creating a complex backdrop that makes long-term predictions challenging. Fear of a Deeper Correction: The longer Bitcoin struggles to break out, the greater the concern among traders that a more significant price correction might be on the horizon. Bitfinex’s Insightful Market Analysis A recent market note from leading cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex provides crucial insights into this phenomenon. Their analysts have observed a clear unwillingness or inability among bulls to push BTC prices higher without new catalysts or clear macro signals. This observation underscores the sentiment that the market isn’t just pausing; it’s actively waiting for something significant to happen before committing to a direction. According to Bitfinex analysts, the market is experiencing: Market Dynamic Bitfinex Analysis Profit-Taking Pressure “Mitigating profit-taking pressure” suggests that while some profit-taking is occurring, it’s not overwhelming, but enough to cap upward movement. Buying Appetite “Coupled with a lack of buying appetite” indicates that new money isn’t rushing in to absorb the selling pressure or push prices higher. Catalyst Requirement Bulls need “new catalysts or clear macro signals” to regain confidence and drive the price upwards. This analysis from Bitfinex highlights a critical juncture where the market is less about fear or greed and more about patience and anticipation. Navigating the Current Market Sentiment The prevailing Market Sentiment is one of caution and consolidation. Unlike the euphoric phases where every dip was seen as a buying opportunity, the current mood is more reflective and strategic. This period of lower volatility and sideways movement can be frustrating for active traders, but it also presents an opportunity for investors to re-evaluate their portfolios and strategies. Understanding the underlying sentiment is key to making informed decisions. Key aspects of the current market sentiment include: Lack of Conviction: Neither bulls nor bears have seized definitive control, leading to range-bound trading. Focus on Fundamentals: With price action stalled, more attention is being paid to Bitcoin’s network health, adoption rates, and regulatory developments. Anticipation of Macro Shifts: The market is keenly watching global economic indicators, central bank decisions, and geopolitical events for clues about future direction. This phase is a test of patience for many, emphasizing the importance of a long-term perspective over short-term fluctuations. What’s Next for BTC? Identifying Potential Catalysts For BTC to break free from its current range and achieve a new all-time high, it will likely require significant catalysts. These could come from various sources, both internal to the crypto ecosystem and from the broader macroeconomic environment. Identifying these potential triggers is crucial for investors trying to anticipate the next big move. Potential catalysts include: Clear Macroeconomic Signals: A definitive shift in inflation trends, interest rate policies, or global economic growth could provide the clarity investors seek. Increased Institutional Adoption: Major corporations or financial institutions announcing significant Bitcoin holdings or new crypto-related products could inject fresh enthusiasm. Regulatory Clarity: Positive or clear regulatory frameworks in major economies could reduce uncertainty and encourage broader participation. Technological Advancements: Significant upgrades or developments within the Bitcoin network or the broader crypto space could renew interest. Halving Event Anticipation: While still some time away, the next Bitcoin halving will eventually start to factor into long-term price models, though its immediate impact is less relevant for current hesitation. Without such catalysts, the market may continue to consolidate, reflecting the hesitant stance of traders and investors. Conclusion: Navigating the Waiting Game The current market landscape, marked by trader hesitation and Bitcoin’s struggle to achieve new highs, is a testament to the evolving maturity of the cryptocurrency space. As highlighted by Bitfinex’s analysis, the market is in a crucial waiting game, anticipating catalysts that can ignite the next major rally. This period of consolidation is not necessarily a sign of weakness, but rather a reflection of a more discerning investor base demanding clearer signals before committing capital. For those invested in BTC , patience and a keen eye on both on-chain metrics and global macroeconomic trends will be paramount. The next surge, when it comes, will likely be driven by a confluence of factors that restore confidence and provide the necessary momentum for Bitcoin to once again claim new territory.

2025-07-09T11:45:05,"BlackRock Suddenly Snubs US Government Bonds, Shifting to This Geography Amid Sticky Inflation Concerns: Report","The world’s largest asset manager has reportedly turned on US Treasuries. In a report seen by Bloomberg , BlackRock Investment Institute strategists recently upgraded their view on European government bonds from slightly underweight to neutral, comparing them positively to US government debt obligations. BlackRock also notes that the Federal Reserve may hold back on cutting interest rates due to sticky inflation, while high budget deficits might urge investors to ask for a higher yield premium to hold long-dated US bonds. “We prefer euro area government bonds and credit over the US. Yields are attractive, and term premium has risen closer to our expectations relative to US Treasuries.” The BlackRock strategists specifically highlight bonds from Italy and Spain. The asset manager isn’t the only financial giant to take a less optimistic view of US Treasuries. Goldman Sachs market strategists also recently lowered their forecasts for US Treasury yields on the basis that the Federal Reserve will most likely begin cutting interest rates sooner than expected. Goldman’s economists originally predicted the Fed would only enact one rate cut near the end of the year, but they are now expecting cuts in September, October and December. The Financial Times recently reported that $11 billion in US long-term bond funds focused on government and corporate debt were sold in only three months. The second quarter sell-off ends a three-year run of net inflows into long-term US bond funds, with the previous sell-off occurring in 2022 Q2.

2025-07-09T11:34:52,"Ripple Taps The Oldest US Bank to Custody RLUSD","The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BNY Mellon) continues to serve as a global partner for different cryptocurrency-related initiatives, and the latest involves Ripple and its recently launched stablecoin. According to a press release by the company, the oldest bank in the US will serve as a custodian for RLUSD. The statement reads that both parties are “jointly committed to paving the way for digital asset adoption at institutional scale, and together, are bridging the gap between traditional finance and crypto.” RLUSD saw the light of day at the end of last year when the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) gave the green light. It’s now one of the few global stablecoins issued under the agency’s Trust Company Charter. It is pegged to the US dollar at a 1:1 ratio, and it is backed by “high-quality liquid assets,” the company stated. Unlike other stablecoins, RLUSD is not focused on retail engagement. Instead, it has been “purpose-built for enterprise utility, particularly in improving the speed, cost, and efficiency of cross-border payments.” “As primary custodian for RLUSD, we’re proud to support the growth of digital assets by providing a differentiated platform, designed to meet the evolving needs of institutions in the digital assets ecosystem,” commented Emily Portney, Global Head of Asset Servicing at BNY. In addition to the collaboration for RLUSD custody, Ripple will also utilize BNY’s transaction banking services to “underpin its operations and continue delivering seamless solutions for its customers.” BNY was one of the first US banks to dip its toes in the cryptocurrency market years ago, well before the country’s political and regulatory landscape became as favorable as it is now. Since the early COVID days, the institution has launched several BTC and crypto-related products and provides custody to certain digital asset firms, such as Grayscale .

On July 7, a crypto investment company, Paradigm , joined the alliance and filed an amicus brief , challenging the DOJ’s attack on software developers publishing open source code. Crypto Firm Coalition Against DOJ Paradigm reported on Monday that it has joined forces with— DeFi Education Fund, alongside the Blockchain Association, Crypto Council for Innovation, the Digital Chamber, the Solana Policy Institute, the Bitcoin Policy Institute, and the Uniswap Foundation— to support plaintiff, Michael Lewellen. Lewellen, the developer who created a non-custodial crypto protocol and wanted to make it publicly available, merely published the code, which is not a money transmission, contrary to what the DOJ accused him of. Why the Crypto Firms are Fighting Against the DOJ? The crypto group coalition called the Department of Justice’s prosecution unfair and accused it of misusing section 1960 of the Title 18 of the US Code. In their filing, the coalition reported that the government is actively prosecuting P2P crypto software, even when the developers are publishing open-source software. Developers who followed the rules, consulted lawyers, and relied on government guidance are also finding themselves at the risk of indictment or are facing trials like Roman Storm. Emphasizing the wrongdoing of the DOJ, Paradigm stated– “We filed the brief because the government’s position is not just wrong on the law; it threatens the future of neutral crypto infrastructure in the United States and will send innovation fleeing overseas.” Urging the Government to Maintain Clarity in Laws The crypto group coalition urged the government to give more clarity on the DOJ laws before prosecuting. Without clarity, developers will keep facing penalties and imprisonment, halting innovation in the US. The amicus brief submitted by the coalition defines unlicensed illegal money transmitting, which, according to the crypto firms, was not committed by Lewellen. Final Thought The crypto group coalition believed that people would lose faith in the US law if it does not provide clarity before executing charges. It will also confuse the developers to understand what falls under legal circumstances and what doesn’t. If this harsh and illogical regime continues, many developers will start to flee overseas to continue their innovative work.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/crypto-firms-fight-doj-over-developer-code-crackdown/,"REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|SOL","News",cryptocompare

Saylor thinks regulatory hindrances will affect altcoins’ growth. The altcoin market has experienced an upsurge since the beginning of H2, 2025. The altcoin market has surged 16% in the past few weeks, a sharp rebound that directly challenges the long-held, skeptical view of influential Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor.

2025-07-09T11:15:00,"Tariffs Don't Budge Bitcoin, PNUT Pops on Musk Rant: Crypto Daybook Americas","By Francisco Rodrigues (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin (BTC) is hovering around $108,600, pretty much unchanged over 24 hours. The broader CoinDesk 20 ( CD20 ) index added 1.8%, shrugging off the uncertainty surrounding President Trump’s recent tariff threats against various countries. President Donald Trump sent letters to 14 nations, including key partners in Asia, warning that tariffs will be applied starting Aug. 1 unless they make concessions to the U.S. when it comes to trade. Trump also said he will impose a 50% tariff on imported copper and up to 200% on pharmaceuticals. Traditional markets were also muted in their responses. U.S. equity indexes were flat in yesterday’s session, while Europe opened with a slight upward momentum and Asian indexes closed higher. The U.S. dollar index is pretty much unchanged. The market’s reaction suggests the so-called TACO — Trump always chickens out — trade is still in play. It's a reference to the president’s negotiation pattern, in which tariffs are announced and then reversed. That's even after he s aid “there will be no change” to next month's deadline. Still, past tariff announcements stoked inflation concerns, and this latest one comes as the Federal Reserve tightens liquidity to the tune of $40 billion a month , according to analysts at crypto hedge fund QCP Capital. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has warned that tariff‑driven price spikes might delay any rate cuts, which would make risk assets like crypto less attractive for investors. Nevertheless, earlier scares of a U.S. recession have cooled, with perceived odds of that happening this year dropping to 20% on Polymarket , the lowest since January. Over the past week, cryptocurrency investment products brought in nearly $1 billion in net inflows, according to CoinShares data, pushing total assets to a record $188 billion . Bitcoin funds captured the lion’s share of those flows, with ether, solana and XRP funds logging solid demand. Combined with a stream of corporate treasuries raising funds to buy bitcoin, demand remains elevated for the leading cryptocurrency. Apart from exceptions like PNUT and some Grok-influenced memecoins, other altcoins aren’t faring as well. Bitcoin’s dominance has risen nearly 12% year-to-date to now account for roughly 65% of the ecosystem's total market capitalization. Whether the TACO trade will hold its merit ahead of the August deadline remains to be seen. Stay alert!

PNUT jumped over 10% within minutes and saw 24-hour trading volumes more than triple to $214 million, according to CoinGecko data, as traders rushed in on the name-drop. The token has no affiliation with Musk or the squirrel and no underlying utility. It trades purely on cultural resonance and speculative momentum. A separate, AI-driven event took hold after Grok, the chatbot on X, hallucinated a bizarre response referencing “MechaHitler,” “GigaPutin” and “CyberStalin” — terms that quickly went viral. Within hours, over 200 MechaHitler-themed tokens had launched across Solana and Ethereum, with the largest on Bonk.fun hitting a $2.2 million market cap and over $1 million in early volume, DEXTools data shows. At least one Ethereum-based version touched a $500,000 market cap, highlighting how quickly speculative capital chases meme narratives. The episode highlights how AI-generated content — even hallucinatory or unhinged — is now a legitimate trigger for on-chain trading activity, rivaling traditional influencer-driven pump-and-dump schemes. Grok later walked back the comment, clarifying the name referred to a 1990s video game character from Wolfenstein 3D and was meant as satire, not endorsement. Derivatives Positioning The cumulative notional open interest in ether USDT and dollar-denominated perpetuals listed on major exchanges has risen above 5 million ETH, the highest since June 20, alongside positive funding rates to suggest a bias for long positions. BTC perpetuals remain as dull as the spot price. XRP's open interest holds steady near five-month highs, also exhibiting a bullish market sentiment. On Deribit, options market activity shows $110K as price magnet for BTC and $3.20 as the focus for XRP. BTC and ETH 25-delta risk reversals showed a mildly bullish bias across tenors. Block flows featured a BTC calendar spread and a long put position in the July 18 expiry put at the $106K strike financed by writing the same expiry $108K strike call.

2025-07-09T11:05:27,"Time is running out for Bitcoin’s parabolic rally, warns analyst","Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) ability to mount a parabolic rally may be fading based on its technical indicators, according to a trading expert. In this line, analysis by TradingShot suggests that another major rally could be limited by Bitcoin’s position within a well-defined long-term uptrend that has yet to produce the kind of rallies seen in the past cycles. In a TradingView post on July 9, the analyst noted that since bottoming in November 2022, Bitcoin has traded within an upward channel that closely aligns with a Fibonacci channel guiding price movements since 2013. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Despite short-term pullbacks, the overall trend remains intact and is technically targeting a new higher high. Notably, most of this cycle has occurred in the ‘buy zone’ of the Fibonacci channel. Historically, major rallies have followed breakouts from this zone. For instance, in the 2017 and 2021 cycles, such breakouts triggered rapid, exponential moves into the upper Fibonacci bands, delivering significant gains. So far, TradingShot stressed that this cycle has not produced a similar breakout. To this end, Bitcoin recently tested resistance near its all-time high but failed to hold above it. What’s next for Bitcoin? At the same time, the expert warned that if Bitcoin is to follow its traditional four-year cycle pattern, driven by the supply shock from the halving time, it may be running out of time to deliver a comparable parabolic move before the cycle matures. “So far, we haven’t got such rally on the current Cycle and with time running out (assuming the 4-year Cycle model continues to hold), do you think we will get one this time around?” the analyst said. The analysis suggested potential price targets between $280,000 and $530,000 if Bitcoin can replicate its historical breakout pattern, with key technical indicators aligning with the 50- and 200-week moving averages ( MA ). Bitcoin price analysis At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $108,777, up approximately 0.25% in the last 24 hours, having largely remained in a state of consolidation over the past week.

2025-07-09T11:01:04,"Riot Platforms Looks Good Heading Into Year-End","Summary Upgrading RIOT to a Buy due to a strong crypto market outlook, relatively fixed mining costs, low valuation, and a compelling technical setup. Riot Platforms' business model is incredibly scalable when Bitcoin prices stay and rise beyond profitability thresholds. Valuation remains attractive at 1.4x P/B, well below historical averages, with potential upside over 100% if sentiment improves. This is a speculative, high-risk play with significant downside if Bitcoin crashes, not a long-term hold—take profits on strength. Introduction Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) has gained a lot of traction in recent weeks. On May 5, I published an article on RIOT with a Hold rating. If I helped motivate existing shareholders to hold, great, but in retrospective, the best course of action would have been to iterate a Buy, as the stock has outperformed the S&P 500 by 4X since that article went live. Seeking Alpha This comes as Bitcoin has seen impressive relative strength the last few months as well, after recovering quickly from its April lows. It is currently just 3.5% off its ATH and looks like it wants to reach a few new ones this year. TradingView Revenue growth has seen improvements for three consecutive quarters in a row, but so have expenses. Simultaneously, RIOT is scaling their energized hashrate (E/H), aiming for 38 E/H at the end of 2025. Combining efficiency gains with Bitcoin prices at or above profitability thresholds makes Riot Platforms' business very scalable, at least for this year, as cycle theory suggests a rough 2026 . For RIOT to be profitable, I estimate that average Bitcoin prices need to remain above $100k, which is a safety margin added on top of their Q1 2025 $81k average cost to mine one Bitcoin, including miner depreciation. Further appreciation of Bitcoin will flow to RIOT's bottom line, be it from net proceeds from Bitcoin mining or unrealized gains from their treasury strategy, which is why they are so compelling for investors expecting the crypto market rally to continue. Macrotrends Their Bitcoin HODL stack is growing while they continue to sell most (but not all) of their produced Bitcoins. In an update on June production , of the 450 produced BTC, 48 went into their stack, which reached 19,273 BTC. At $108k, this adds up to a value of $2.1B and already makes up roughly 50% of their market cap. My goal with this article is to touch on my previous analysis and analyze RIOT fundamentally as well as technically. After having done so, I am upgrading Riot Platform to a Buy, due to strong cryptocurrency market outlooks for this year, costs to mine remaining fixed, a low valuation, and a strong technical setup. Valuation RIOT is a hardware-heavy business due to all the servers they need to facilitate their bitcoin mining. Combining this with the fact that RIOT's phases of profitability occur very seldom and revenues are highly cyclical, I believe the P/B ratio is best for a multiples valuation. They're currently trading at a level of 1.4X, which is significantly lower than their 5-year average of 2.9X. Mining risk could be priced in as a P/B ratio close to one, which suggests the market distrusts the business' capability of generating earnings. If the assets of a business can be sold (in total) for what the company is worth, there can't be high (or any) expectations of net income production, as that would result in a large earnings yield and make the company undervalued. Data by YCharts They are leaning more into AI/HPC , though, which supports more predictable revenue and no surge in expenses every four years like the Bitcoin halving causes. This might in fact not be fully priced in. I therefore believe that amid a continued crypto rally that lightens up investor sentiment for miners like Riot Platforms, their P/B could reach the set average again, which offers upside potential north of 100%. Technical Analysis The technical analysis I shared in my last article (depicted below) was decently accurate, as I saw short-term upside potential to around $14. In actuality, the price recently ended up at $12.7, supported by a lot of momentum. TradingView (Previous Analysis) Since then, I slightly adjusted the descending resistance so it has more points of connection. The momentum of the recent rise can be seen in the weekly RSI reaching highs of 63. Levels like this usually lead to short-term corrections, so nothing to worry about here. In addition to the RSI, price was also rejected from this newly adjusted trendline. Price action of recent weeks has built an uptrend that is clearly confirmed by higher highs and higher lows. A slight pullback now is healthy and does not negate the set uptrend if it does not form a lower low. Currently, it is far from doing so. TradingView Zooming in to the daily chart, the uptrend becomes more apparent, as RIOT currently trades above the 50-200 EMAs. A new support line has been formed from the lows, which can help both maintain the structure and lead to increased appreciation as well as guide us on where price could go in 2025. Following this trend, I estimate RIOT could reach $16 per share, which implies and upside potential of 39%. This poses as my minimum price target. TradingView Needless to say, this is not a play on technical undervaluation but rather one on trend continuation, as price is more overbought than before but the current uptrend remains intact. Risks With this name, associated risks are elevated, especially when I am recommending a Buy after a strong performance following my previous Hold rating. Valuation metrics have obviously gone up but are still on the cheaper end. The biggest risk remains Bitcoin volatility. I expect Bitcoin to experience a significant drop (60%+) in 2026 following cycle theory, but it remains just a theory after all. Such a crash could happen anytime, including this year. That would wipe out my whole investment thesis, as RIOT would have to go back to reporting huge losses and dilute shareholders more heavily. Losses on their Bitfarms investments might also offset this year's profitability, as they're currently sitting on about $130M in unrealized losses. Conclusion At current prices, RIOT is a speculative Buy. Revenue growth seems solid; they are increasing efficiency; mining costs should stay somewhat flat - all while Bitcoin is set to reach new ATHs this year, skyrocketing their mining revenues and HODL stack's unrealized gains. At a low valuation and supported by a technical uptrend, this can lead to explosive returns in the coming months. I do feel the need to highlight that this is only for investors with a large appetite for risk. I also want to reiterate that this rating by no means constitutes a buy-and-hold recommendation, as I am convinced RIOT is not a good long-term investment.

2025-07-09T11:00:52,"Japanese Firm to Test Bitcoin and XRP Redemption Via Credit Card Points","Japan is once again at the forefront of cryptocurrency adoption . A new initiative will enable users of Aplus, a credit card service under the Shinsei Bank Group, to redeem their loyalty points for digital assets, including Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP. The development, shared by prominent crypto commentator Xaif on X, reflects a growing trend in the country to integrate crypto into mainstream financial services. The program is being launched through a partnership between Aplus and SBI VC Trade, the crypto exchange arm of SBI Holdings, one of Japan’s largest financial conglomerates and a long-time proponent of XRP. According to official sources, the redemption scheme will allow users to convert Aplus Points into BTC, XRP, and ETH, with a conversion rate that values 2,100 points at approximately ¥2,000 worth of crypto. The feature will be made available via a user-friendly interface integrated into the existing cardholder platform. JUST IN: Japanese Firm to Test Bitcoin and $XRP Redemption Via Credit Card Points pic.twitter.com/j2Ch9N0rGj — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) July 9, 2025 Bringing Crypto Into Everyday Finance This pilot marks a significant evolution in how Japanese consumers interact with digital assets. Rather than earning crypto rewards on new purchases, as seen in earlier initiatives like Gemini’s XRP cashback credit card, users can now redeem their already accumulated points for top-tier cryptocurrencies. This approach lowers the barrier for mainstream users to access crypto, turning everyday credit card use into a gateway for digital investment. SBI’s involvement also adds weight to the program’s potential. The company has been at the forefront of XRP adoption in Japan , and its strategic moves have already brought Ripple-based infrastructure to over 70% of the country’s banking sector. With plans to hit 80% coverage by the end of 2025, this new consumer-level integration through Aplus is a natural extension of SBI’s broader vision. Why XRP Is a Central Piece While Bitcoin remains the most recognized name in crypto, XRP’s role in this initiative is especially notable. Known for its speed and low-cost transactions, XRP is already being used by Japanese banks for cross-border payments via RippleNet and xRapid. By enabling Aplus users to redeem points for XRP, the program strengthens XRP’s presence in the consumer finance ecosystem and may increase its real-world usage. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 SBI Holdings President Yoshitaka Kitao has often emphasized XRP’s utility over Bitcoin’s store-of-value appeal, calling it better suited for practical financial transactions. This pilot reinforces that stance, positioning XRP not just as an asset for traders but as a functional part of everyday digital finance. What This Means Going Forward For consumers, the program offers an easy and risk-free entry into the world of crypto. Instead of traditional redemptions such as gift cards or airline miles, cardholders can now choose to convert their loyalty rewards into valuable digital assets. For the industry, this move signals a shift: crypto is no longer confined to exchanges or investment platforms; it’s entering daily financial behavior. As the pilot unfolds, its success could pave the way for similar programs across Japan and globally. With strong institutional backing and user-friendly design, the initiative may be the first of many to blur the line between traditional banking and decentralized finance.

2025-07-09T10:53:52,"Trump's Tariff Threat Fails to Move the Needle on Fed Interest Rate Expectations","U.S. President Donald Trump has intensified his tariff rhetoric this week, but financial markets aren't convinced, likely expecting the President to back down and eventually reach a compromise with trading partners. Earlier this week, the Trump administration sent out letters to 14 countries, warning of higher tariffs on their export of goods to the U.S. starting on Aug. 1. The original 90-day pause on tariffs was set to expire on July 9. On Tuesday, Trump stated on Truth Social that the Aug. 1 deadline won't be extended and new tariffs will go into effect on that day. However, markets seem to believe the adage that Trump always chicken out (TACO), as evident from the steady interest rate expectations in the U.S. As of writing, the CME's FedWatch tool showed expectations for two 25 basis point rate cuts this year, with the first to come through in September. Markets priced out the July rate cut following Friday's hotter-than-expected jobs report and the hawkish repricing has held steady in the wake of Trump's tariff threat. At the same time, there seems to be little-to-no fear about a tariff-led spike in inflation, else traders might have priced out the September rate cut as well. That's in stark contrast to March when Trump's tariff threats saw traders price rapid fire rate cuts, starting from June this year. Perhaps, traders expect the deadline to be suspended indefinitely, leading to negotiations and eventual trade deals, as ForexLive noted . The MOVE index, which measures the options-based 30-day implied volatility in the U.S. Treasury notes, continues to trend lower as opposed to early this year when trade war fears and fiscal concerns saw the index rise from 86.00 to 139.00 in two months to early April. The U.S. equity markets and bitcoin (BTC) aren't paying heed to Trump's threat either. On Monday, the S&P 500 dropped 0.8% to 6,210 points and quickly stabilized Tuesday at 6,225. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, continues to trade lackluster above $105,000, CoinDesk data show. Both markets peaked in February and trended lower as the first round of tariffs war unfolded in March and early April. Lastly, the dollar index, which tracks the greenback's value against major currencies, rose 0.55% to 97.60 Monday and has since stabilized around these levels, topping the bearish trendline from the Feb. 3 highs.

2025-07-09T10:49:45,"Tether’s Bold Play: Aiming to Become the World’s Largest Bitcoin Miner This Year","Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino revealed that the company is on track to become “probably the biggest miner in the world” by the end of 2025. Ardoino acknowledged that, in most cases, direct BTC investment yields higher profits than mining, but emphasized Tether’s strategic choice to participate in mining to protect its treasury and support Bitcoin’s network security. Bitcoin Mining Supremacy In a recent interview with Bankless, Ardoino explained that the stablecoin issuer already holds significant Bitcoin reserves and therefore has an incentive to contribute to the network’s decentralization through mining operations across South America, the United States, and other regions. Ardoino highlighted the importance of maintaining a mining presence in the US during what he described as a “monumental time” for the industry. On profitability, the exec noted that while block rewards will eventually drop to zero, on-chain fees are expected to rise significantly, which will turn the Bitcoin main chain into a settlement layer for Lightning channels and major contracts. He suggested that these contracts would underpin an “enormous amount” of transactions. In line with Tether’s broader efforts to promote decentralization, it announced plans to open-source its Bitcoin Mining OS (MOS) last month to help new miners enter the market without costly vendor reliance. Ardoino had then described MOS as scalable, modular, and built on peer-to-peer IoT architecture, which is designed to support existing mining infrastructure like containers and power devices. The rollout is expected by the fourth quarter of 2025. The exec said this move would help more companies to compete in securing the Bitcoin network. Earlier, the company partnered with Ocean mining pool to decentralize block building by committing its current and future hash rate to the protocol. Tether’s Gold Reserves Alongside its aggressive mining ambitions, Tether has been quietly expanding its reserve strategy beyond Bitcoin. In fact, Ardoino recently revealed that the firm holds approximately $8 billion in gold, which is around 80 tonnes, in a Swiss vault he described as “the most secure vault in the world.” The exec added that Tether owns nearly the entire stockpile, which makes it one of the largest private gold holders globally. Gold now comprises almost 5% of Tether’s $112 billion reserves, on par with UBS’s precious‑metals holdings.

2025-07-09T10:45:31,"The 7 Best Altcoins for Next Bull Run According to Q3 2025 Price Activity","While headlines keep circling the same old names, early adopters are now shifting their focus to altcoins showing real technical strength and traction in Q3 2025. With market activity climbing, price movements are hinting at what could potentially lead the charge when the next full bull run kicks off. From decentralized AI to cross-chain operability, the most promising altcoins are quietly stacking gains and expanding use cases. One such name that has moved aggressively from presale to all-time high is Qubetics , a new entrant already making noise with its cross-chain wallet and robust validator rewards. In this guide, Qubetics is analyzed alongside other top-performing altcoins showing strong signals right now. These eight picks aren’t about hype, they’re backed by rising utility, strategic integrations, and growing community support. Whether it’s Stacks reshaping Bitcoin DeFi or Immutable X bringing Web3 to gaming, this article breaks down the most compelling altcoins right now. This is where the best altcoins for next bull run start to reveal themselves, and where early positions could turn into serious returns. 1. Qubetics (Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet Is Changing the Game) Qubetics is reshaping digital finance with a real utility wallet that doesn’t just hold assets, it connects them. The Qubetics Wallet functions as a non-custodial, multi-chain application, compatible across mobile (iOS/Android) and desktop platforms. It provides virtual Visa and Mastercard debit card support, a cross-chain interface, and tokenized bandwidth incentives. More than just another storage solution, it’s built to empower users through control, privacy, and accessibility. Virtual cards can be created within the wallet to facilitate secure online purchases, while Apple Pay and Google Pay integration allows fast retail usage in the real world. One of the standout real-world examples is the seamless conversion feature embedded in the app. When users transact using $TICS tokens, the wallet instantly converts them into USDT or USDC at the point of sale, ensuring stability for merchants and frictionless crypto-to-fiat commerce for buyers. This real-world transaction support reinforces Qubetics’ long-term viability in a crowded crypto economy, where speed and trust matter. This project isn’t simply building wallets, it’s enabling entire ecosystems to interact across chains without KYC or high fees. That’s one reason it’s now widely seen as one of the best altcoins for next bull run . Qubetics Launch Data Shows High Early Returns and Solid Market Floor Qubetics has not just introduced advanced tools, it has delivered results that are drawing attention from both seasoned crypto traders and new participants. At launch, the token surged from $0.40 to $4.20 within the first hour, marking a 950% spike. Early presale backers who entered at $0.01 saw up to 420x returns, making Qubetics one of the rare cases of early access translating into real, fast-tracked profit. Consider this: a $5,000 allocation at the $0.01 presale rate would’ve secured 500,000 $TICS. At its ATH of $4.20, that stack would have been worth $2.1 million, showing the real impact of early conviction. Over $18.4 million was raised across 28,500+ contributors during the presale, with 517 million tokens distributed. Post-launch, Qubetics registered over $700,000 in trade volume on MEXC within the first 24 hours. Its Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) model strengthens this foundation. Validators earn 30% APY, while delegators with a minimum of 5,000 $TICS earn a share of those rewards, creating a powerful loop of participation and passive earning. With a solid $2 support level and high buy pressure, analysts are already revising their projections upward, suggesting a possible target of $10 to $15 after full mainnet deployment. Why This Coin Made it to This List: Its early performance, real-world interoperability, and passive earning model powered by Delegated Proof of Stake ( DPoS ) make Qubetics one of the best altcoins for next bull run. 2. Stacks (Bringing DeFi to Bitcoin) Stacks continues to gain attention for its push to make Bitcoin programmable. By enabling smart contracts and decentralized apps (dApps) on top of Bitcoin, Stacks unlocks DeFi functionality that Bitcoin natively lacks. Q3 has shown a marked uptick in developer activity, wallet creation, and TVL (total value locked) within the ecosystem, signaling growing adoption. Stacks’ anchor to Bitcoin offers a degree of stability not often seen in other L1 smart contract platforms. The Clarity smart contract language ensures predictability and reduces vulnerabilities, making it an appealing choice for long-term builders. Integration with new Layer 2 solutions also keeps transactions efficient and scalable, essential for user growth. Why This Coin Made it to This List: With DeFi finally arriving on Bitcoin through Stacks, its protocol could see mass usage during a bull cycle, putting it among the best altcoins for next bull run. 3. Arweave (Permanent Storage for On-Chain Data) Arweave isn’t trying to replace existing blockchains, it’s solving the long-term problem of decentralized data storage. It provides permanent storage on-chain, which is already being used by NFT projects, DAOs, and even news publications to secure content forever. Q3 activity reflects new institutional-level interest and integrations, suggesting that its tech is being taken more seriously than ever before. The protocol relies on its unique “blockweave” structure, which allows nodes to store a randomized subset of old blocks, cutting down on redundant storage while still ensuring data availability. As decentralized content networks grow, Arweave’s ability to timestamp and lock content permanently is becoming vital. Why This Coin Made it to This List: Its use case is critical to scaling Web3’s infrastructure, making it a strong contender among the best altcoins for next bull run. 4. Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance (ASIA) Formed by the merger of Fetch.ai, Ocean Protocol, and SingularityNET, the Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance is building a decentralized AI ecosystem that avoids corporate centralization. This coalition is working toward developing a shared intelligence framework that enables private AI agents to exchange value, resources, and logic on-chain. Q3 has seen significant cross-project collaboration and token utility enhancement, including resource pooling and interchain agent protocols. The collaboration also expands the individual networks’ reach, driving more value into the unified ASI token. By integrating machine learning with blockchain transparency, ASIA is addressing issues in both ecosystems. Why This Coin Made it to This List: With AI’s importance growing, a decentralized model like ASIA positions itself at the right intersection of data sovereignty and tech advancement, marking it as one of the best altcoins for next bull run. 5. Immutable X (Scalable NFT Gaming Infrastructure) Immutable X remains a leader in Ethereum Layer 2 scaling for gaming and NFTs. By enabling zero gas fees and near-instant settlement for digital assets, it solves the core issue of congestion and cost on Ethereum’s mainnet. Q3 partnerships with gaming studios and retail brands confirm that real-world adoption is progressing steadily. The project uses StarkWare’s ZK-rollup tech to batch transactions off-chain and publish them on Ethereum without compromising security. The seamless user experience, especially for gamers unfamiliar with gas fees or wallet complexities, gives it a unique foothold. Why This Coin Made it to This List: With blockchain gaming heating up again, Immutable X is ready to capture that volume, placing it among the best altcoins for next bull run. 6. Hedera (Enterprise Grade Blockchain Utility) Hedera Hashgraph is pushing boundaries by offering enterprise-grade solutions with unmatched transaction finality and network throughput. Backed by governing council members including Google and IBM, its native service for tokenization and consensus is already being used by Fortune 500 companies. In Q3 2025, Hedera saw more integration in tokenized real-world asset experiments, driving institutional attention. Its low-energy consensus model also fits well with ESG investment mandates, adding further potential for future institutional alignment. Why This Coin Made it to This List: With real enterprise use cases and unmatched speed, Hedera fits right into the best altcoins for next bull run narrative. 7. Astra (Modular Web3 Ecosystem) Astra is making headlines with its modular architecture that allows projects to plug into various services, such as identity, DeFi rails, and smart contracts, without building from scratch. This plug-and-play design lowers the barrier for Web3 onboarding, particularly for small teams and startups. Q3 has shown consistent network upgrades, deeper SDK adoption, and new DeFi protocols launching on Astra. As the market seeks modular, scalable platforms to replace monolithic chains, Astra’s tech stack positions it well. Why This Coin Made it to This List: Modular architecture is gaining traction, and Astra’s efficiency makes it one of the best altcoins for next bull run. Conclusion: Final Picks for the Best Altcoins for Next Bull Run From Qubetics’ early breakout and advanced wallet features to Stacks’ smart contracts on Bitcoin and Immutable X’s scalable NFT rails, each of these eight altcoins shows serious potential. Qubetics alone combines fast ROI, no-KYC interoperability, and a strong Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) model, making it a standout. Meanwhile, Hedera and ASIA bring in enterprise-grade and decentralized AI innovation, respectively. For those looking to align themselves with technically sound projects, this is where the best altcoins for next bull run are already forming their base. Staying informed now could set up the right moves later.

2025-07-09T10:45:14,"Bitcoin (BTC) ready for takeoff as the dollar loses steam","BTC traders often track the DXY metric because of the correlation between the dollar’s dominance and Bitcoin’s pump and dump cycles. Right now, the DXY has sunk to a historically weak level, trading 6.5 points below its 200-day moving average, marking the largest deviation in the past 21 years. Meanwhile, U.S. debt has also reached new all-time highs. Both occurrences are concerning, but crypto enthusiasts may not feel too concerned about the falling DXY as it actually tends to benefit risk assets like Bitcoin. BTC bulls hope the falling DXY benefits Bitcoin as it has historically done. Source: CryptoQuant The dollar’s weakness historically gives BTC an edge When the dollar weakens , losing its safe-haven appeal, investors are forced to reassess their portfolio and allocate capital toward alternative asset classes like BTC. Historical data shows that periods like this, where the DXY showed great weakness, have been highly favorable to BTC. Good examples of times when this happened include 2021 and 2023, when there were significant DXY drops that coincided with BTC rallies. As it stands, analysts believe the market is setting up for the weakness of the DXY to potentially fuel a new BTC price rally. That opportunity is made even more enticing thanks to current monetary policy expectations including rate cuts, rising global M2 money supply and an increased demand for high-yield corporate bonds. The impact of the DXY’s weakness on BTC’s price has yet to reflect It is true the dollar is significantly weakened currently, but unlike in the past, its effect on Bitcoin’s price action seems subdued as the leading crypto is currently more than 2% lower than its all-time high of $111,814. This hesitation on Bitcoin’s end to behave as it would historically have during periods of dollar weakness can be linked to technical factors like the strong resistance level at the $110,000 – $112,000 range. Another potential reason is the sidelined liquidity. Yes, Bitcoin has finally secured a foothold in the corridors of power. However, many investors are still sidelined due to macroeconomic factors and analysts are convinced it contributes to BTC’s delayed response to the DXY’s weakness. Despite this, traders remain bullish on BTC’s potential. The DXY’s current significant deviation below its 200-day moving average is a powerful indicator of early bull phases for BTC, not just because of the technical triggers, but because it signals pending liquidity flow into the crypto markets. Overall activity on the Bitcoin network has also reduced and continues to do so as more investors go into HODL mode after previous rounds of profit taking. The institutional race to stockpile Bitcoin has also caused the percentage of coins left unmoved for over a year to increase from 61.7% to 63.61% by April 2025. If the DXY does not recover, it increases the potential of Bitcoin trending higher as retail investors who faded into the woodwork when institutions started buying heavily may emerge again.

2025-07-09T10:40:13,"Why Is Crypto Up Today? – July 9, 2025","The crypto market is up today. The majority of the top 100 coins per market cap have appreciated over the past 24 hours. At the same time, the cryptocurrency market capitalization has fallen 2.5% to $3.44 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $82.5 billion, one of the lowest levels we’ve seen over the past few days. TLDR: The crypto market turned upwards, with 95 of 100 coins going green; BTC is unchanged, trading at $108,322, while ETH saw the highest increase in the top 10 category; The prices and the sentiment continue moving sideways, awaiting further signals; The Dollar Index (DXY) has hit a historically weak, with BTC benefiting; US BTC and ETH ETFs continue positive, albeit minor flows; ETFs will continue to attract “significant investment from institutions and retail investors”; Investors are assessing the global trade and tariffs-related developments in the US. Crypto Winners & Losers In another shift from green to red and back to green, the prices of nearly all top 10 coins per market cap have appreciated today. Bitcoin (BTC) is up 0.4%, the same amount it had dropped this time yesterday, meaning it’s unchanged, currently trading at $108,812. At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) appreciated by 3.1%, currently changing hands at $2,629. This is the highest increase in this category. The second-highest rise is XRP (XRP)’s 3% to the price of $2.33. Tron (TRX) is the only coin red coin, but its price is unchanged over the past day. It currently stands at $0.2869. Looking at the top 100 coins, we find that 95 of them are up at the time of writing. Two of these recorded double-digit increases. Cronos (CRO) and SPX6900 (SPX) are up 16.4% and 12.5% to $0.09335 and $1.4, respectively. On the other hand, Bonk (BONK) and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) fell the most in this category. They’re down 6.3% and 2% to the prices of $0.0000218 and $1.06, respectively. The markets are largely waiting for additional signals, deciding where to move. Financial markets overall, but stocks more so than crypto, are keeping a close look on even the most minute developments in the US related to tariffs and trade. Meanwhile, South Korea has moved to reclassify crypto trading and brokerage firms as “venture companies.” This would provide these companies with access to government subsidies, tax incentives, and financial support. The Ministry of SMEs and Startups issued a notice on Monday and proposed an amendment to its startup law to include Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) in the venture company category.

The latter currently trades 6.5 points below its 200-day moving average. This is the largest deviation in the past 21 years, the analysts says. “Although this may appear alarming at first glance, it actually tends to benefit risk assets like Bitcoin,” they add. The dollar weakens and loses its safe-haven appeal, leading investors to “reassess their portfolio allocations and shift capital toward alternative asset classes.” Weak Dollar, Strong Bitcoin: A Time-Tested Correlation “This chart highlights periods where the DXY trades below its 365-day moving average. Looking at historical data, it becomes clear that such periods have been highly favorable to BTC.” – By @Darkfost_Coc pic.twitter.com/viwbcfNhdM — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) July 9, 2025 Moreover, Andrejs Balans, Risk Manager at YouHodler , commented on the impact of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on the crypto market. “A big win for the crypto community came” when the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first spot ETF. At first, the market responded with caution, with both BTC and ETH dipping slightly. However, many analysts expect the ETFs will continue to attract “significant investment from institutions and retail investors who want a straightforward way to participate in crypto without managing wallets or private keys,” Balans says. “The fund could help increase liquidity and reduce price swings over time by making crypto exposure more accessible.” ETF and Strategy Bitcoin purchases heatmap. We need more orange. pic.twitter.com/4uPsIIKfXY — Julio Moreno (@jjcmoreno) July 8, 2025 The SEC approving these ETFs signals that the regulator is “becoming more open to crypto investing as the market matures and better safeguards are established.” Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, BTC trades at $108,812. Last day’s trading was quite choppy. However, the price did not go below the $108,000 level. The lowest it dropped to is $108,198. Also, the intraday high is $109,090.

2025-07-09T10:38:17,"Hyperbitcoinization Begins? Why Corporations Are Racing to Drain Bitcoin Supply","The post Hyperbitcoinization Begins? Why Corporations Are Racing to Drain Bitcoin Supply appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Could corporations trigger the end of fiat currency? Crypto analyst Adam Livingston thinks so, and he’s not alone. In a bold prediction, Livingston warns that the corporate rush to accumulate Bitcoin is creating a massive demand shock. The supply squeeze could soon push BTC into uncharted territory and force a dramatic shift in global finance. Corporations Are Stacking Bitcoin Faster Than Ever According to Livingston, public companies now hold over 858,850 BTC, worth more than $93 billion , about 4.09% of the total Bitcoin supply . “Most of the newly mined Bitcoin is now going straight to corporate treasuries,” Livingston stated on X . This surge is being led by giants like MicroStrategy, which owns around 597,325 BTC (over $64.9 billion). The company’s strategy is clear: Issue more shares Use the funds to buy BTC Increase BTC-per-share Boost stock value Repeat the cycle Livingston calls this a “Bitcoin flywheel,” a feedback loop that turns stock dilution into Bitcoin accumulation, undermining fiat currencies in the process. Bitcoin Mining Supply Is Shrinking, Fast Miners are no longer selling their rewards. The current BTC block reward stands at 3.125 BTC, and it’s set to halve again in 2028. This means: New supply is slowing Corporate demand is accelerating Bitcoin scarcity is intensifying Livingston emphasizes that this imbalance is unsustainable, and a massive price breakout is inevitable. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin to $1 Million in Months? Samson Mow Reveals Shocking Scenario , Bitcoin Reserves on Exchanges Hit Record Low CryptoQuant data shows that the total Bitcoin reserves across exchanges are now at just 2.4 million BTC. At the current buying pace, Livingston warns, “This entire reserve could be depleted within months.” With CFOs treating BTC as a strategic reserve asset, demand from institutions may soon leave retail investors sidelined. The Final Phase: Hyperbitcoinization? Livingston’s forecast goes beyond a simple bull market. He believes this is the early stage of hyperbitcoinization a financial revolution where Bitcoin becomes the preferred store of value over fiat.As regulations legitimize BTC as a treasury asset, more companies will jump in. Once that phase is over, the “early adopter” window will close forever. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Hyperbitcoinization is a global financial shift where Bitcoin replaces fiat as the dominant store of value and unit of account. Why are Bitcoin reserves on exchanges dropping? BTC reserves are at record lows due to rising institutional demand and miners holding, causing major supply pressure. How much Bitcoin do corporations own in 2025?

2025-07-09T10:36:40,"BTC holds $107K, ETH eyes $3,100, yet MUTM might be the real 60x story of 2025","Bitcoin (BTC) stabilized at $107,000 with a $2.07T market cap, up 2.5% last week, driven by $7.1B in ETF inflows and Texas’s reserve law. A golden cross signals a 1.2x rally to $125K, but volatility risks $100K. Ethereum (ETH) traded at $2,424, up 0.5% last week, with $269M in ETF inflows and EIP-7782’s 2x block speed fueling a potential 1.3x rally to $3,100, though $2,800 resistance could trigger a drop to $2,200. As Bitcoin (BTC) stabilizes above $107,000 and Ethereum (ETH) pushes toward the $3,100 mark, the spotlight is turning toward smaller tokens with outsized growth potential. Among them, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining attention for combining real protocol mechanics with tokenomics designed for long-term scalability. Now in Phase 5 of its presale at just $0.03 per token, the project has already attracted over 12,800 holders and raised more than $11.9 million. With 65% of the current phase sold out and the next price jump to $0.035 fast approaching, this is a moment of urgency for early entrants. While the major coins maintain their position, seasoned investors are starting to prioritize utility over hype. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out by offering a dual lending infrastructure — blending peer-to-contract (P2C) liquidity pools with customizable peer-to-peer (P2P) loan contracts. That combination gives users broad flexibility to earn or borrow using different strategies, making the platform one of the most adaptive in the new DeFi cycle. Staking, stablecoin utility, and long-term trajectory What gives Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a further edge is its plan to generate long-term protocol revenue and distribute that value through mtToken staking. Users will stake their mtTokens in designated smart contracts to receive MUTM dividends funded by real platform income — not inflationary emissions. As more users participate and loan activity increases, those earnings are expected to scale accordingly. The team is planning to launch an overcollateralized stablecoin to be used for treasury growth and internal lending mechanics. This stablecoin will be backed by reserved assets and is designed to drive protocol liquidity while supporting borrower confidence. Alongside this, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to integrate Layer-2 scaling, which will lower transaction costs and increase accessibility for users worldwide. Security remains a key focus, with all smart contracts undergoing a full audit by CertiK. The team has also launched a $100,000 giveaway to onboard new users and incentivize early support ahead of listing. The listing itself will take place at a $0.06 token price, which means buyers in Phase 5 are already looking at a 100% increase from their entry point — even before the protocol goes live. One leading altcoin-focused fund has projected a 60x return on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) based on a full platform rollout, stablecoin adoption, and network-driven token demand post listing. According to that forecast, the token could hit $1.80 by late 2025, placing it alongside early breakouts like Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX) in terms of trajectory. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) lending mechanics designed for scalability The heart of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s architecture is its twin-track lending system. The P2C pools will allow users to deposit blue-chip tokens or stablecoins into contracts that lend out the assets based on protocol algorithms. The more those assets are borrowed, the higher the yield — and each deposit is represented by an mtToken that grows in value as interest is earned. These tokens offer transparent, real-time yield tracking, and are expected to be one of the key drivers of long-term demand. For example, a user who deposits $13,000 in USDC will receive mtUSDC in 1:1. Based on an average APY of 17% determined by pool utilization, that user would see $2,210 in annual passive income, entirely automated through the smart contract. This system removes the need for manual farming and sets a new standard for passive DeFi earnings. The P2P lending experience will unlock even more versatility. Borrowers and lenders will be able to customize their contracts around different types of collateral, durations, and interest rates. For tokens that are not accepted by most DeFi platforms — such as memecoins including PEPE, DOGE, SHIB or more volatile altcoins — Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s P2P module will offer a solution. For those waiting for the next big DeFi move while BTC and ETH hold their ground, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a rare opportunity. At $0.03, the window remains open — but not for long. Once Phase 6 begins, prices move to $0.035, and early access disappears.

2025-07-09T10:32:29,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) Was 2021’s Star, Experts Believe Remittix (RTX) Is Set To Be 2025’s Biggest Wealth Generator","The post Shiba Inu (SHIB) Was 2021’s Star, Experts Believe Remittix (RTX) Is Set To Be 2025’s Biggest Wealth Generator appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Shiba Inu lit up 2021 with eye-watering gains, turning pocket change into life-changing sums. Three years later the meme magic has faded, and analysts are hunting for the next rocket. Their pick? Remittix (RTX) a tiny payment token now priced at just $0.0811 but racing toward a major launch that could reshape how everyday people move money. Shiba Inu’s Flash of Fame Source: tradingview Back in 2021, Shiba Inu rode a perfect storm of social buzz and low entry cost. Early buyers watched $100 turn into five-figure stacks almost overnight. Yet the same features that sent SHIB soaring endless supply and meme-only branding have turned into weight. Token burns help, but price action remains tied to hype cycles, not real demand. SHIB’s community is still huge, but newer traders want more than jokes. They want tokens linked to services they actually use. The crypto market has matured since the meme boom. Users now expect instant transfers, clear fees and apps that feel like normal banking. Coins that solve practical problems think stablecoin settlements or on-chain gaming have stolen attention from pure memes. That shift sets the stage for Remittix, which aims to turn crypto into bank cash in seconds. Remittix: Turning Phones into Global ATMs Remittix’s upcoming PayFi wallet is different from typical wallets. Imagine a worker in Manila who gets paid in Bitcoin on Friday and needs pesos by Saturday morning. With PayFi she scans a QR code, taps “cash out” and pesos land in her local bank before her coffee is cold. Behind the scenes, the app chooses the cheapest corridor, handles foreign-exchange and sends the payout with no exchanges, no off-chain wait. What makes RTX stand out is recurring demand. Every paycheck, gig payment or family remittance that flows through PayFi requires a small amount of RTX for network fees. Those fees aren’t recycled; they are locked in a treasury burn schedule that permanently reduces circulating supply at the end of each month. Less supply plus rising usage is a math equation even an eighth-grader can spot. Why Analysts Call RTX the Next Wealth Engine Shiba Inu showed that affordable tokens can mint fortunes but its fate rested on memes. Remittix offers a similar low price with a real-world pipeline that taps the $190 trillion global payments market. If PayFi rolls out smoothly in Q4 and users flock to its cheap, instant cash-outs, recurring fee demand could push RTX supply ever lower and prices far higher by 2025. Shiba Inu wrote the story of 2021’s meme mania. Remittix hopes to script 2025’s tale of utility-driven growth. With a product people can actually use, a shrinking supply model and a final funding sprint almost complete, RTX might be the token that turns today’s spare change into tomorrow’s headline wealth.

2025-07-09T10:30:54,"Ethereum Bullish Signal: Whales Scoop Up 200,000 ETH","On-chain data shows the Ethereum whales have participated in some notable buying, a sign that could be bullish for the ETH price. Ethereum Whales Have Added To Their Holdings As explained by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, the supply of the Ethereum whales has recently gone up. The on-chain metric of interest here is the “ Supply Distribution ” from the analytics firm Santiment, which tells us about the total amount of an asset that a given wallet group is holding right now. Addresses or investors are divided into these cohorts based on the number of coins that they are carrying in their balance. The 1 to 10 coins cohort, for instance, contains all the holders owning between 1 and 10 ETH. In the context of the current topic, the whale group is of focus. The range of this cohort is typically defined as 10,000 to 100,000 ETH. At the current exchange rate, the lower bound converts to $26.2 million and the upper one to $262 million. Thus, the only investors who would qualify for the group would be the big-money ones. Such holders can carry some degree of influence in the market, so their behavior, represented by the trend in their Supply Distribution, can be worth monitoring. Here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the trend in the Supply Distribution of the Ethereum whales over the last couple of weeks: As is visible in the above graph, the Ethereum Supply Distribution for the 10,000 to 100,000 coins investors has recently seen an increase, implying these holders have participated in net accumulation. In total, the whales have added 200,000 ETH (worth around $524 million) to their holdings with this buying spree. This is a significant amount and suggests some large holders think the cryptocurrency is worth buying at the current price. It only remains to be seen, however, whether this bet would pay off for these investors. In some other news, there is a strong accumulation zone for Ethereum around the $2,500 level, as the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has pointed out in an X post . The above chart shows the data for the Ethereum Cost Basis Distribution Heatmap, an indicator that tells us how much of the asset’s supply was last purchased at what price levels. “ETH’s Cost Basis Distribution Heatmap shows ~$2.5K as one of the strongest accumulation zones in months,” notes Glassnode. “Over 3.45M $ETH has a cost basis in the $2,513–$2,536 range, reinforcing this level as a major support zone.” ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $2,600, up 3% in the last 24 hours.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-bullish-signal-whales-scoop-up-200000-eth/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","Ethereum|ETH|Ethereum Bullish|Ethereum Buying|Ethereum Whales|ETHUSDT",cryptocompare

2025-07-09T10:27:49,"Early Bitcoin Buyer Says Dismissing XRP Today Is a Mistake","Pro-XRP game developer Chad Steingraber recently reignited confidence in XRP with a post highlighting his early Bitcoin investment. According to Steingraber, he bought all his Bitcoin when it was just $3,000, a decision that has paid off massively.Notably, BTC last sold for exactly $3,000 in December 2018. The leading crypto also maintained prices in the $3K range in early 2019 before it left that region for good.In the nearly seven years that followed, Bitcoin has gone on to reach its peak price of $112,000. In perspective, that marks a massive 3,633% surge. Even today, it retains most of those gains, stabilizing around $109K.Don’t Miss XRP After Missing BitcoinIn his post, Steingraber emphasized that he would have missed the opportunity to enter Bitcoin early and net a 37X return if he had listened to the naysayers. He suggests that XRP is now in a similar phase. The tweet subtly warns that listening to skeptics could lead to missing out again.Steingraber’s message resonates with a broader sentiment within the XRP community. They believe XRP could become as valuable as Bitcoin in the future and that long-term value often emerges when sentiment is at its lowest.These comparisons surface as XRP’s long-term performance continues to frustrate holders. The coin has traded below its peak for nearly eight years, with many critics labeling it a poor long-term investment but viable for short-term speculation.Ignoring the Noise, Focusing on ValueHowever, XRP proponents see such skepticism as similar to what Bitcoin faced in its early stages. Some commentators also point out that XRP has existed nearly as long as Bitcoin.Notably, XRP emerged three years after Bitcoin, though their performance remains miles apart. For instance, around 2018/2019, when Bitcoin was last seen at $3K and Steingraber entered, XRP was around $0.28. Since then, XRP’s price has increased about 11X compared to Bitcoin’s 37X.Many attribute XRP’s perceived underperformance to the SEC lawsuit . While the legal battles are now behind it, the coin has yet to stage the historic breakout many hope will make them rich.Yet, amid the wait, pundits continue to highlight that a day of reckoning is coming for XRP, and those ignoring it today may regret it. According to crypto educator Edoardo Farina, investors have until Ripple unveils a new plan for the XRP in escrow. After that, he believes FOMO will send the price through the roof.Separately, influencer Coach JV said XRP holders stand to benefit from one of the greatest wealth transfers in history. According to him, those sleeping on XRP will regret it in the future.But When?Amid all these promises of a bright future, the lingering question on investors' minds is: When will this teased future arrive? Early Bitcoin holders are already cashing out billions from investments made when prices were under $0.10. As for XRP holders, the wait continues. However, pundits like Steingraber have continued to advise patience.https://twitter.com/JDin5D/status/1942040888881934643",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/07/09/early-bitcoin-buyer-says-dismissing-xrp-today-is-a-mistake/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=early-bitcoin-buyer-says-dismissing-xrp-today-is-a-mistake,"XRP|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS","Market|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today",cryptocompare
2025-07-09T10:27:10,"Altcoin Season Could Begin in October, 3 Signals You Shouldn’t Ignore","The post Altcoin Season Could Begin in October, 3 Signals You Shouldn’t Ignore appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News It’s been a brutal cycle for altcoins. Bitcoin has taken center stage , dominating the narrative and capital flows, while altcoin holders continue to watch their portfolios stagnate, or worse, bleed. While Bitcoin continues to surge and is sticking above $100k, altcoins have only seen two brief rallies in March and November 2024. But according to crypto analyst Crypto Decoder , several under-the-radar signals now suggest that a broader alt season could be setting up, even if it’s not here just yet. Altseason is delayed this cycle. Only a handful of alts pump while the rest keep bleeding against Bitcoin. Just dropped a new video breaking down the key macro indicators to watch for a reversal, and when our alt bags might finally pump. Watch here https://t.co/zBLsBNt9lq pic.twitter.com/2sI8wWrHHa — Crypto Decoder (@Cryptodecoder0x) July 8, 2025 Dollar Weakness Could Set the Stage One of the most important signs comes from the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY). Crypto Decoder highlights that when the dollar weakens, altcoins often gain massive momentum. In 2017, a sharp drop in the DXY led to a 285x explosion in altcoin market cap. In 2021, a similar move sparked a 17x rally. This pattern ties closely to U.S. monetary policy, when the Federal Reserve loosens financial conditions and borrowing gets easier, investors typically move into riskier assets. Bitcoin is usually the first stop, followed by altcoins. Right now, the DXY is showing signs of fading strength and has failed to break above the 109 mark. If it falls below key support levels, it could trigger renewed interest in altcoins. Still, Decoder cautions that a real shift in Fed policy will likely be needed before we see any explosive price action. Check out This Hidden Macro Indicator Another strong but lesser-known signal is the copper-to-gold ratio. This metric reflects investor sentiment. When copper outperforms gold, it suggests a growing risk appetite in the market. According to the analyst, the ratio has just bounced from multi-year lows and climbed above its 20-week EMA , an early signal that conditions are becoming favorable for altcoins, much like what happened before the 2017 and 2020 rallies. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Firms in South Korea Set to Finally Gain Legal Status, Tax Incentives , Ethereum Leads the Way ETH outperformed BTC last quarter, first time since Q4 2022. With institutional flows finally coming in, ETH is showing real strength against Bitcoin after years of bleeding out. Remember, ETH doing well is good news for our bags. Not ready to comment on SEASONality just yet. pic.twitter.com/baaFFulWnl — Crypto Decoder (@Cryptodecoder0x) July 6, 2025 Ethereum’s recent performance also adds to the bullish case. ETH has started outperforming Bitcoin for the first time since late 2022. This comeback, powered by over $2 billion in ETF inflows since May 2025, hints at growing institutional interest. Since ETH holds over 50% of DeFi TVL and drives liquidity for altcoins, its strength often leads to broader altcoin gains. Altcoin Season Could Heat Up in Q4 Although August and September may bring more sideways action, analyst believes the real opportunity may arrive in Q4. If the Fed cuts rates in September, and macro signals hold up, October could mirror past post-halving rallies. Supporting this view, analyst Michaël van de Poppe notes that the Altcoin Season Index has once again bottomed in June, just like it did before previous major alt rallies. With the bull cycle in motion and easing expected, he sees potential for a much bigger altcoin surge by Q4, like it happened in 2023. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-09T10:21:38,"Solana could rally to $164 if it breaks out of this key pattern","Solana could be on the verge of a rally to $164 soon as it looks poised to break out of a popular bullish pattern, according to an analyst. According to a July 9 post on X by analyst Ali, Solana has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern on the 4-hour chart, characterized by two converging trendlines representing lower highs and higher lows. Such a pattern suggests a period of price consolidation that typically culminates in a breakout in either direction. Ali noted that a confirmed breakout above the upper boundary of the pattern, located near the $153 resistance level, could trigger a bullish move with a short-term target of $164. SOL price, MACD and RSI chart — July 9 | Source: crypto.news As of press time, Solana ( SOL ) was trading exactly at this key threshold, setting the stage for a potential technical breakout. Momentum indicators support the bullish outlook. On the 4-hour/USDT chart, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence line has crossed above the signal line, with both trending upward. Traders view this as a sign that buying interest is picking up, and the price may continue to rise. Additional technical insights were provided by another pseudonymous analyst, SDX, who observed that SOL has been coiling below a descending trendline formed since the beginning of the year. A successful breakout and retest of this level, SDX notes, could act as a catalyst for a stronger uptrend, potentially opening the door to a new all-time high if buying volume confirms the breakout. You might also like: Bitcoin eyes gains as dollar index sinks to 21-year lows — Can BTC surge past all-time high? Fundamentals are also panning out in Solana’s favor. First, SOL was recently included as one of the featured assets in Trump Media and Technology Group’s proposed “blue-chip” cryptocurrency ETF, according to a filing with the U.S. SEC. Second, reports indicate that the U.S. SEC has requested issuers to amend and resubmit applications for spot Solana ETFs by the end of July, potentially accelerating the timeline for formal approval. When the SEC makes such a request, it typically signals that the agency is not rejecting the proposals outright but is open to moving forward if certain conditions are met. Traders often view this kind of regulatory engagement as a bullish sign, interpreting it as a step closer to approval that could unlock fresh demand from institutions and retail investors alike. Meanwhile, Solana has also emerged as a leading blockchain in the real-world asset tokenization sector. Data from Dune Analytics shows that tokenized RWAs on Solana reached a record $418 million, with a 631% increase in active users over the past 30 days. This is further backed by strong network activity. Daily active addresses for Solana shot up to 15.39 million from just 3.46 million the previous day, marking a dramatic 345% increase in network activity. Source: Santiment Stablecoin supply on the Solana network has also steadily increased over the past week. Stablecoins are the backbone of decentralized finance, serving as a critical medium of exchange, store of value, and unit of account within blockchain ecosystems. For Solana, this could mean an influx of new users is leveraging the chain for payments, trading, and tokenized asset settlements, which in turn can further support the bullish narrative. SOL was trading roughly 48% below its all-time high of $293 at press time.

2025-07-09T10:20:54,"Bitcoin Market Cap: South Korea’s Stock Market Stages Stunning Comeback","Are you closely watching the ebb and flow of digital assets versus traditional finance? The world of finance just witnessed a significant shift that has many investors talking. For a period, Bitcoin, the world’s leading cryptocurrency, held a commanding lead in total market capitalization over an entire nation’s stock market. However, a recent report indicates a stunning reversal: the Bitcoin market cap has been edged out by the combined might of South Korea’s KOSPI and KOSDAQ stock exchanges. What’s Happening in the South Korea Stock Market ? In a development that highlights the dynamic nature of global finance, South Korea’s traditional equity markets have successfully reclaimed their position ahead of Bitcoin in terms of total market capitalization. According to Herald Business, as of July 8, the aggregate market cap of the KOSPI and KOSDAQ stood at an impressive 2.96 quadrillion won (approximately $2.16 trillion). This figure marginally surpassed Bitcoin’s 2.95 quadrillion won (around $2.15 trillion) for the first time since November of last year, when Bitcoin initially surged ahead. This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it signifies a broader narrative about investor sentiment, economic performance, and the ongoing dance between established financial systems and emerging digital assets. The South Korea stock market has shown resilience and growth, driven by various factors we’ll explore, ultimately leading to this significant overtake. Key Market Capitalization Comparison (as of July 8) Asset/Market Total Market Cap (KRW) Total Market Cap (USD) South Korea Stock Market (KOSPI + KOSDAQ) 2.96 Quadrillion Won $2.16 Trillion Bitcoin 2.95 Quadrillion Won $2.15 Trillion The Evolving Landscape of Bitcoin Market Cap Bitcoin’s journey has been nothing short of a rollercoaster. From its humble beginnings to becoming a trillion-dollar asset, its market capitalization has been a key indicator of its adoption and investor confidence. The fact that its Bitcoin market cap could, for a time, exceed the entire stock market of a developed nation like South Korea speaks volumes about the disruptive potential of cryptocurrency. However, Bitcoin’s value is highly volatile, influenced by: Macroeconomic Factors: Interest rate changes, inflation concerns, and global economic stability directly impact risk-on assets like Bitcoin. Regulatory Developments: News of new regulations, bans, or approvals in major economies can cause significant price swings. Institutional Adoption: Increased interest from large financial institutions and corporations often boosts Bitcoin’s legitimacy and price. Market Sentiment: FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) or FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) can quickly shift the collective mood of crypto investors. The recent dip in Bitcoin’s market cap, while slight in this comparison, reflects the ongoing challenges and consolidation phases the cryptocurrency market often experiences after periods of rapid growth. Understanding the Dynamics of KOSPI KOSDAQ Performance South Korea’s two main stock exchanges, KOSPI (Korea Composite Stock Price Index) and KOSDAQ (Korean Securities Dealers Automated Quotations), represent the backbone of the nation’s economy. KOSPI typically lists larger, more established companies, while KOSDAQ focuses on tech, biotech, and smaller growth-oriented firms. Their combined performance is a strong indicator of South Korea’s economic health and investor confidence in its corporate sector. What might have fueled the recent surge in KOSPI KOSDAQ market capitalization? Strong Corporate Earnings: Many South Korean companies, particularly in the tech and automotive sectors, have reported robust earnings, attracting investor interest. Government Support: Policies aimed at boosting domestic consumption and investment can provide tailwinds for the stock market. Global Economic Recovery Hopes: Optimism about a global economic rebound can lead to increased foreign investment in emerging markets like South Korea. Shift from Risk Assets: Some investors might be reallocating funds from higher-risk assets like cryptocurrencies back into more traditional, albeit still growth-oriented, equities. The resilience and growth demonstrated by KOSPI KOSDAQ highlight the enduring strength of established equity markets, even in an era of digital disruption. Implications for Global Financial Markets This market cap shift in South Korea isn’t just a local story; it carries broader implications for global financial markets . It serves as a reminder that while cryptocurrencies have carved out a significant niche, traditional markets remain formidable forces with deep liquidity and established regulatory frameworks. Here are some key takeaways for global investors and market watchers: Diversification Remains Key: The event underscores the importance of a diversified investment portfolio that balances traditional assets with emerging ones. Interconnectedness: The performance of one asset class can influence sentiment and capital flows in others, demonstrating the interconnectedness of global financial systems. Regulatory Impact: The stability and predictability offered by regulated stock exchanges continue to be attractive, especially during periods of uncertainty in less regulated spaces. Economic Fundamentals Matter: The underlying economic strength and corporate performance of a nation can ultimately dictate the trajectory of its financial markets. As central banks worldwide navigate inflation and economic growth, the performance of both traditional equities and digital assets will continue to offer crucial insights into investor behavior and the future direction of capital. Navigating Current Crypto Market Trends While South Korea’s stock market has temporarily taken the lead, this does not diminish the long-term potential or significance of Bitcoin and the broader crypto ecosystem. Instead, it offers a moment for reflection on current crypto market trends and what they mean for investors. The cryptocurrency market is maturing, experiencing cycles of boom and bust, and constantly evolving with new technologies and use cases. What does this specific market cap shift suggest for crypto enthusiasts? Volatility is Inherent: Expect continued price fluctuations. Bitcoin’s journey will not be a straight line up. Long-Term Vision: For many, Bitcoin is a long-term investment, a hedge against inflation, or a foundational technology for a new financial paradigm. Short-term market cap comparisons, while interesting, don’t always capture this long-term view. Innovation Continues: Beyond Bitcoin, the crypto space is teeming with innovation in DeFi, NFTs, Web3, and more, which will drive future growth. Regulatory Scrutiny: As crypto gains mainstream attention, increased regulatory oversight is inevitable, which could bring both challenges and opportunities for stability and wider adoption. Investors should remain informed, exercise caution, and understand that the crypto market operates on different fundamentals than traditional stock exchanges. Conclusion: A Shifting Financial Landscape The news that South Korea’s KOSPI and KOSDAQ have collectively surpassed Bitcoin’s market capitalization is a compelling headline that underscores the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of global finance. It highlights the enduring strength of traditional stock markets, particularly in robust economies like South Korea, while also reminding us of the inherent volatility and evolving narrative of digital assets. This isn’t necessarily a ‘win’ for one side over the other, but rather a snapshot of a moment in time, illustrating the continuous interplay between established financial systems and the disruptive forces of cryptocurrency. For investors, it reinforces the timeless principles of diversification, informed decision-making, and adapting to ever-changing market conditions. Whether you’re bullish on equities or believe in the digital revolution, understanding these shifts is crucial for navigating the complex world of finance.

2025-07-09T10:17:15,"Tether stores $8b worth of gold in a secret vault in Swiss: report","Stablecoin issuer giant Tether reportedly owns almost 80 tons gold that backs its assets. The gold stockpile is kept in a vault in Switzerland in an undisclosed location for security reasons. According to a recent report by Bloomberg, Chief Executive Paolo Ardoino said that the pile of gold is worth $8 billion. He claimed that the gold is kept in a facility that is the most “most secure vault in the world.” Although, the company would not reveal its location for security reasons. Ardoino also declined to disclose when the vault was establish. The only detail he unveiled was that the vault is based somewhere in Switzerland . At the moment, the USDT ( USDT ) stablecoin issuer Tether holds nearly 80 tons of gold, with most of it being owned directly by the company. The amount is almost equal to the total value of metals and other commodities held by UBS Group. This large stockpile makes Tether one of the largest gold holders in the world outside of banks and nation states. You might also like: Gold hits new ATH at $3,390, is Bitcoin close behind? Ardoino acknowledged the rise in safe haven assets especially gold compared to fiat currency in his interview with Bloomberg. He said the decision to have their own vault instead of paying vault operators was driven by the rising cost of the asset. “Gold, I think should be logically a safer asset than any national currency. So eventually, I think that if people start to get concerned about the potential increase of the debt of United States, they might look at alternatives,” said Ardoino. According to the data from Trading Economics, gold has rallied as much as 38.5% in the past year. It also reached a new all-time high at $3,390 on April 21. At press time, it sits at a value of $3,289. Gold is often used as a hedge by investors against inflation, much like how Bitcoin ( BTC ) is viewed the same way. “Every single central bank in the BRICS countries is buying gold, so that is why gold price went up in our opinion,” he said. Earlier in April, the stablecoin giant issued 7.7 tons of physical gold to back its digital asset Tether Gold or XAUT ( XAUT ), which currently holds pure gold as a reserve backing on a 1:1 ratio. At press time, XAUT’s market cap stands at more than $811 million.

2025-07-09T10:10:51,"Bitcoin ETFs See Remarkable $80M Inflows: A New Era of Institutional Crypto Investment Begins","The world of cryptocurrency is buzzing with exciting news! On July 8, US Spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced a significant surge, recording a total net inflow of $80.08 million. This marks a pivotal moment, extending the streak of positive flows for the fourth consecutive trading day. For anyone following the evolution of digital assets, this consistent influx of capital into Bitcoin Inflows through regulated investment vehicles signals a growing confidence and appetite from the traditional financial sector. What’s Driving the Latest Bitcoin Inflows? This impressive performance isn’t just a fleeting moment; it’s a testament to the increasing comfort and strategic positioning of institutional investors within the crypto space. The continuous positive inflows highlight a shifting narrative around Bitcoin, moving it further into the mainstream financial landscape. But what exactly does this mean for the broader market, and why are we seeing such sustained interest? The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year opened the floodgates for a new wave of investors who previously might have been hesitant to directly hold cryptocurrencies. These ETFs offer a regulated, accessible, and often more palatable way for institutions and retail investors alike to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of direct ownership, such as managing private keys or navigating crypto exchanges. Key Players Leading the Charge in US Spot Bitcoin ETFs While the overall net inflow figure is compelling, a closer look reveals which players are truly dominating this new wave of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption . BlackRock’s IBIT continues to be a powerhouse, consistently attracting the lion’s share of new capital. This isn’t surprising, given BlackRock’s immense reach and reputation in traditional finance. Here’s a snapshot of the individual ETF performances on July 8: ETF Ticker Issuer Net Inflows (July 8) IBIT BlackRock $66.82 million BTC Grayscale (mini) $4.82 million FBTC Fidelity $4.75 million BRRR Valkyrie $3.69 million Others Various No Change As evident from the table, BlackRock’s IBIT is not just leading; it’s significantly outperforming its peers in terms of attracting new capital. This dominance suggests that large institutional investors are comfortable placing their trust and funds with established financial giants, even when venturing into the relatively newer asset class of Bitcoin. How Do These Inflows Impact Crypto Market Trends? The consistent positive flows into spot Bitcoin ETFs have several profound implications for the broader Crypto Market Trends and the future trajectory of Bitcoin: Increased Liquidity and Stability: As more capital flows into these ETFs, it enhances the overall liquidity of the Bitcoin market. Greater liquidity can lead to reduced price volatility, making Bitcoin a more attractive asset for a wider range of investors. Validation of Bitcoin: The sustained institutional interest acts as a powerful validation for Bitcoin as a legitimate and viable asset class. This can encourage more traditional financial entities to explore digital assets, further bridging the gap between old and new finance. Potential for Price Appreciation: While not a direct cause-and-effect relationship, consistent buying pressure from ETFs can contribute to Bitcoin’s price appreciation. As demand outstrips supply, especially with Bitcoin’s capped supply, the price tends to rise. Broader Accessibility: The success of these ETFs demonstrates the immense demand for accessible Bitcoin investment products. This could pave the way for more innovative crypto-related financial products in the future, catering to diverse investor needs. It’s important to remember that while inflows are a positive sign, the crypto market remains dynamic and subject to various global macroeconomic factors, regulatory developments, and technological advancements. However, the current trend paints a hopeful picture for Bitcoin’s journey towards wider adoption. What’s Next for Institutional Bitcoin Adoption? The momentum seen in US Spot Bitcoin ETFs is likely to continue, especially as more financial advisors and wealth managers become educated about these products and integrate them into client portfolios. We could see: Increased Competition: As the market matures, expect more innovation and competition among ETF providers, potentially leading to lower fees and more diversified offerings. Global Expansion: The success of US ETFs could inspire similar product launches in other major financial jurisdictions, further globalizing institutional access to Bitcoin. Educational Initiatives: Financial institutions will likely ramp up efforts to educate their clients on the benefits and risks of Bitcoin ETFs, fostering greater understanding and potentially driving more inflows. While the journey of Bitcoin and the broader crypto market is always filled with its share of ups and downs, the consistent positive inflows into these ETFs underscore a significant and undeniable trend: institutional money is here, and it’s increasingly making its presence felt. This marks a new chapter in Bitcoin’s story, one where it’s not just a speculative asset but a recognized and increasingly integrated component of global investment portfolios. The recent surge in Bitcoin Inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs, spearheaded by giants like BlackRock’s IBIT, is a powerful indicator of growing institutional confidence and the increasing maturity of the crypto market. Four consecutive days of positive net inflows, totaling $80.08 million on July 8, highlight a robust demand for regulated Bitcoin exposure. This trend is not just about numbers; it signifies a broader acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, promising enhanced liquidity, stability, and potentially further price appreciation. As Institutional Bitcoin Adoption continues to accelerate, driven by the accessibility and convenience of ETFs, the future of Crypto Market Trends looks increasingly intertwined with traditional finance, opening new avenues for growth and investment.

2025-07-09T10:09:17,"Crypto Firms in South Korea Set to Finally Gain Legal Status, Tax Incentives","The post Crypto Firms in South Korea Set to Finally Gain Legal Status, Tax Incentives appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Crypto fans will love this! South Korea’s government is taking steps to support the crypto industry by officially recognizing crypto businesses as part of its venture ecosystem. A new proposal from the Ministry of SMEs and Startups aims to let crypto firms register as “venture companies” – a status that gives access to tax cuts, government-backed funding, subsidies, and loan guarantees. If approved, the move could bring crypto startups in line with other tech-driven businesses and help boost innovation across the sector. Here is everything you absolutely need to know. A Big Policy U-Turn for South Korea Right now, crypto businesses in South Korea are excluded from registering as venture companies. That’s because current laws group them with restricted sectors like gambling and nightlife which are categories that don’t qualify for state support. That restriction has cost crypto firms. In 2018, Upbit’s parent company Dunamu lost its venture status and was hit with an ₩24 billion (around $18 million) tax bill. The company challenged the decision in court, but lost. The ministry now wants to update the rules. The new proposal would remove virtual asset firms from the restricted list, allowing them to access the same support as other startups. “Virtual asset businesses with innovative and entrepreneurial qualities, based on new technologies, will be newly recognized as venture businesses,” the ministry said. Why This Matters for the Industry If the change is approved, it would mean crypto startups could apply for venture status for the first time, unlocking major benefits. It would also allow existing venture-certified companies to enter the crypto space without losing their status. According to the ministry, the change would “revitalize and broaden the venture ecosystem” and promote growth in the crypto industry. The government is now collecting public feedback on the proposal, with submissions open until August 18, 2025. A Clear Direction Under President Lee The proposal is part of a wider shift under President Lee Jae Myung, who took office last month with a strong pro-crypto stance. His administration is pushing for spot Bitcoin ETFs, planning to introduce a Korean won-based stablecoin, and reviewing the current ban on institutional crypto trading. Some of the country’s biggest banks are already taking steps, from exploring stablecoin products to filing new trademark applications, showing that interest is building. Here’s the bottom line: If passed, this policy could open new doors for crypto businesses in South Korea giving them access to real financial support, and helping the country position itself as a serious player in global crypto innovation.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/crypto-firms-in-south-korea-set-to-finally-gain-legal-status-tax-incentives/,"REGULATION|ASIA|BTC|EXCHANGE|TRADING","News",cryptocompare
2025-07-09T10:06:11,"New Zealand Government Decides to Ban Crypto ATMs! Here's Why","The New Zealand government has decided to ban crypto ATMs in the country and impose a NZD 5,000 limit on international cash transfers. New Zealand Bans Crypto ATMs and Limits Cash Transfers This comprehensive regulation aims to reshape the AML/CFT regime (Anti-Money Laundering/Counter Financing of Terrorism) within the framework of the fight against money laundering and organized crime. The 221 crypto ATMs operating in the country have been scrutinized for allegedly being used in illegal transactions such as transferring criminal proceeds abroad and drug trafficking. New Zealand Deputy Justice Minister Nicole McKee announced the new bill today, stating that the reform would expand the powers of both police and financial regulators, allow intelligence agencies to collect financial data more comprehensively, and that a new funding cut to finance the system would be discussed. “This government wants to go after criminals with determination. Our aim is to make New Zealand the easiest place in the world to do legitimate business and the hardest place in the world for criminals,” McKee said. The new regulation has been welcomed by some in the industry as a positive step. Janine Grainger, co-founder of crypto trading platform Easy Crypto, said the ban is a sign of maturation in the industry, adding: “We've been watching the rapid proliferation of crypto ATMs, but we want this growth to proceed safely and compliantly. That's why we support the ban.” Grainger emphasized that crypto ATMs often operate with high transaction fees of up to 20%, which has now lost its appeal for many users. Arjun Vijay, founder of Giottus crypto exchange, stated that without security measures such as identity verification (KYC), misuse of these devices is inevitable: Bitcoin ATMs, with their high fees and anonymous transaction features, are often used for illicit fund movements. This ban is not surprising. New Zealand's decision comes amid growing global concerns about crypto ATMs being used for criminal activities. In Australia, AUSTRAC has placed the industry under surveillance, citing a rise in crypto scams targeting the elderly. The US city of Spokane has completely banned crypto kiosks after FBI data linked the devices to $5.6 billion in fraud in 2024. It is stated that the ban in New Zealand is not a “setback” in the crypto sector, but rather a sign of a transition to a more robust and secure structure. *This is not investment advice.

Large holders are quietly exiting their positions and the sell signals are becoming harder to ignore. On-chain data shows trillions of SHIB tokens have been moved to exchanges, pointing to a growing loss of confidence among whales. Smart money is shifting to projects that promise real-world value, like Remittix (RTX) . Shiba Inu (SHIB) Faces Sell-off Shiba Inu is trading around $0.00001187, sliding in response to recent whale activity. Market data shows that Santiment reports over half of SHIB’s supply is controlled by just ten wallets. When big holders move their tokens, the impact can be swift and severe. Source: CoinMarketCap A massive single-day drop of over 12% took SHIB to $0.00001177 after trillions of tokens shifted to exchanges. CoinDesk flagged a whale transaction of 2.87 trillion SHIB worth $36 million, but later noted this was a custody transfer, not a sale. Even so, Binance data and other exchanges report similar shifts for institutional wallets, signaling a broader withdrawal of confidence. Despite the sell-off, the number of SHIB wallets has exceeded 1.5 million. The Shibarium Layer 2 migration also continues, with over 1.5 million users already on board. That’s solid ecosystem growth. Shibarium has logged more than 1.2 billion transactions and counts over 266 million connected wallets, a signal that the community is still engaged. But on-chain activity doesn’t always prevent price drops. SHIB now hovers near a critical support level of $0.0000102. Breaks below that could trigger deeper losses, possibly reaching lows near $0.0000060. Why Traders Are Watching Remittix One of the projects catching attention right now is Remittix (RTX) . Unlike meme tokens, RTX solves an actual problem. It lets users convert crypto like SHIB, ETH or BTC into FIAT currencies and send it straight to a bank account, all in one step. Remittix is already catching the attention of freelancers, remote workers and everyday crypto users who just want a simple way to use their earnings. Users don’t need to shuffle through multiple apps or jump between exchanges. Remittix supports over 100 cryptocurrencies and works with 30+ FIAT currencies, so people can cash out or hold onto their money with ease. That kind of convenience is exactly why more users are starting to take notice. As more traders shift focus from hype to utility, tokens like RTX are stepping into the spotlight. They’re not promising the moon. They’re delivering a service people already need. Expert Verdict Gives Remittix the Edge Whale exits, centralized token control and unstable burn rates make Shiba Inu risky in the short term. Ecosystem momentum like Shibarium helps, but might not be enough to offset declining core support. Meanwhile, Remittix is delivering tangible value: crypto-to-cash access that works today. For those steering away from meme coins and looking for utility, Remittix could be the next smart move.

Several altcoins have posted more impressive gains within the same timeframe, including CRO, which skyrocketed by over 17% at one point, and LINK, which is up by 5%. CRO on the Run Following news that Truth Social, the social media giant operated by the Trump family, had filed with the US SEC to launch a Crypto Blue-Chip ETF, which would include BTC, ETH, SOL, CRO, and XRP, the price of the Cronos ecosystem exploded by double-digits. The asset went from roughly $0.082 to $0.095, corrected slightly, but shot up once again in the past day to over $0.1 for the first time in about a month. Although it has lost some traction since then and is currently down to $0.095, it’s still up by over 15% on the day. The other assets mentioned in the filing are also in the green, albeit in a less impressive manner. SOL, XRP, and ETH are up by 1-2% daily. More notable price pumps come from NEAR, AAVE, XLM, HBAR, and LINK, all of which have added around 5-6% of value. The cumulative market cap of all crypto assets has recovered from the losses seen yesterday and is now up to $3.440 trillion on CoinGecko. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

2025-07-09T10:00:19,"3 Crypto Altcoins Surging in July: Trump Token, FloppyPEPE, HyperLiquid","Altcoin Season Heats Up: Market Rotation in Full Swing The crypto market in July 2025 is defined by one clear trend: Bitcoin is consolidating, and altcoins are exploding. As BTC holds steady around the $108K–$110K range, traders are rotating into high-potential alts to chase higher returns. This behavior is a typical hallmark of altcoin season, and it’s unfolding rapidly across meme coins, DeFi platforms, and political tokens alike. Retail interest has resurged, driven by viral narratives and the rise of meme-fi—a hybrid category blending internet culture with real use cases. In this environment, altcoins that combine hype with utility are outperforming, and three standout tokens are drawing serious attention: Trump Token, FloppyPEPE, and HyperLiquid. Each reflects a different narrative, making them prime candidates for diversified exposure. Trump Token: Politics Meets Crypto Trump Token is seeing a wave of speculative investment following renewed campaign buzz and political influencer backing. With the 2024 election aftermath still influencing narratives, this token has remained in the spotlight. Its meme-heavy branding and association with conservative influencers have made it a lightning rod for both attention and controversy. While its price has seen volatility, its staying power shows that political narratives continue to resonate in crypto. Supporters view Trump Token as a digital reflection of a political movement, and that’s precisely where its strength lies. As major events—such as debates, rallies, or endorsements—arise, Trump Token tends to react quickly in the market. For those trading momentum or news-driven spikes, this token is a high-risk, high-reward asset. FloppyPEPE: Meme-Fi With Tools FloppyPEPE continues to raise presale capital—now over $2.7 million—while offering real tools like FloppyAI and Meme-o-matic. The FLOPPY100 bonus code adds extra value for early backers. Its product-first approach gives it a strong edge over purely viral meme tokens. FloppyAI allows users to generate viral meme content automatically, while Meme-o-matic helps deploy them across socials with ease. This unique angle empowers creators, giving FPPE community members the ability to be more than just holders—they become active contributors to the brand’s visibility. With a roadmap that includes staking, governance, and a zero-gas meme exchange called FloppyX, FloppyPEPE isn’t just another meme—it’s a movement. HyperLiquid: Scalable DeFi Without Gas This DeFi protocol offers zero-gas trading and cross-chain liquidity, gaining traction among institutional DeFi users. Its recent partnership with LayerZero is boosting confidence. HyperLiquid is focused on usability and composability, key traits in the future of decentralized finance. By removing gas fees from the trading experience, HyperLiquid drastically lowers the entry barrier for everyday traders and arbitrage bots alike. The platform has also integrated real-time charting tools and advanced analytics, making it a serious contender among DeFi protocols. Its momentum in Q3 suggests that it could be a backbone protocol for the next leg of the DeFi bull cycle. Price Trends and Breakout Setups All three coins have shown strong upward momentum, with FloppyPEPE outperforming on presale growth and Trump Token surging on news events. HyperLiquid is climbing gradually alongside broader DeFi strength. The differing breakout setups offer traders multiple entry styles—from fast momentum to slower trend following. FloppyPEPE’s price is expected to jump significantly after exchange listings, driven by community virality and early adopter benefits. Trump Token’s performance hinges on media cycles, while HyperLiquid’s technical chart pattern is forming a bullish ascending triangle. With altcoin sentiment heating up, all three tokens are under watch by technical analysts. Community Growth Metrics Trump Token’s X engagement is up 40%. FloppyPEPE’s Telegram gained over 5K members in one week. HyperLiquid saw a 30% rise in daily active users. Social and on-chain engagement is a key indicator of momentum, and FloppyPEPE leads in this category. Its meme contests, creator bounties, and referral programs have created a flywheel effect. Trump Token remains politically polarizing, which fuels both fandom and backlash-driven engagement, while HyperLiquid’s traction is quieter but steadily building within DeFi circles. Tokenomics Table Token Supply Unique Feature Growth Mechanism Trump 1B Political branding Influencer-driven FloppyPEPE 420T Meme creation tools Presale + Utility HyperLiquid 100M Zero-gas trading platform Partnerships Analyst Sentiment Analysts rate FloppyPEPE a strong speculative buy due to its growing utility narrative. Trump Token is seen as short-term volatile but sentiment-driven. HyperLiquid is viewed as a safe DeFi bet. The consensus among market researchers is that FloppyPEPE could fill the vacuum left by meme tokens that lack a roadmap. Trump Token continues to offer excellent upside for short-term traders who can time political cycles. HyperLiquid is getting praise from DeFi veterans who believe its architecture makes it ideal for scaling in a multichain world. Diversify With Risk in Mind While Trump Token offers short-term catalysts, FloppyPEPE brings both fun and function. HyperLiquid holds long-term DeFi promise. A diversified portfolio of all three could offer exposure across meme, politics, and finance sectors. As altcoin season heats up in July 2025, these tokens reflect the major narratives of the market —virality, utility, and composability. Whether you’re looking for meme-driven spikes, utility-based growth, or DeFi sustainability, Trump Token, FloppyPEPE , and HyperLiquid represent three uniquely strong plays. Smart traders aren’t picking just one—they’re hedging bets across these sectors for maximum upside.

Buyers are now aiming for a push above immediate Fib levels; however, sellers are strongly defending further surges. The 24-hour volume surged to $2.16 million, showing a surge in interest in trading activity today. Manta is trading at $0.189, surging by over 6% in the last 24 hours.

The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. Manta/USDT 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for a hold above EMA lines The 4-hour Manta price chart suggests MANTA continues to face bearish activity around EMA lines, creating a negative sentiment on the price chart.

However, if the Manta price successfully breaks above $0.201, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.226. MANTAUSD Price Chart by TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, Manta’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.172, resulting in a correction to $0.155. Is MANTA a good investment? Manta’s rapid rise in DeFi TVL charts and alignment with Ethereum ‘s scaling roadmap via technologies like Manta Pacific suggest $MANTA’s potential. Grants support its ecosystem growth, and it leads in ZK technology adoption, promising for blockchain ‘s future. However, regulatory concerns over transaction privacy could affect its long-term viability, potentially impacting ZK protocols like $MANTA. Overall, Manta is a good investment if you want a profitable return in the long term. Why is the Manta price up today? Manta price has triggered a strong bullish rally toward $0.189. This occurred after buyers gained confidence and accumulated heavily around $0.17. Will Manta price recover? If bulls hold the price above $0.2, we might see further recovery toward immediate resistance channels. Will Manta price reach $10? In recent months, the Manta network expanded its offerings and established multiple partnerships. If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $10 mark. Will Manta reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment, the MNT price might take several years to reach the $100 milestone. We expect the Manta price to achieve $100 by 2060. Will Manta reach $1000? $1000 is a distant dream for Manta price. However, if everything remains in favor of the altcoin market, we might even see the MNT price hitting $1K. Is Manta a good long-term investment? Investors are bullish on Manta, which has gained significant attention in recent months. If developers continue to build robust utilities for Manta and the roadmap fulfills user demand, it can be a good long-term investment option. Recent MANTA news/ opinions Kenny Li, one of the co-founders of Manta Network, was recently almost tricked by a phishing scam carried out by the well-known hacking group Lazarus. He talked about the incident in a post on X (formerly Twitter), describing how he came very close to being caught but managed to avoid it just in time. MANTA price prediction July 2025 If the altcoin market witnesses a surge in buying pressure this month, we might see a rebound in the MANTA price. In July, we expect Manta’s price to record a minimum of $0.17 and a maximum of $0.29. The average price is expected to be around $0.2. Manta Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Manta Price Prediction July 2025 $0.17 $0.2 $0.29 Manta price prediction 2025 Due to the impact of Bitcoin’s halving, Bitcoin and leading altcoins could reach new highs in 2025. However, some believe the event’s predictability changes because of crypto’s current popularity. Technical analysis indicates that in 2025, Manta Network is expected to reach a minimum price of $0.15. The MANTA token might attain a maximum price of $3.60, while the average trading price is $1.5.

2025-07-09T09:57:39,"Bitcoin to $1 Million in Months? Samson Mow Reveals Shocking Scenario","The post Bitcoin to $1 Million in Months? Samson Mow Reveals Shocking Scenario appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with a positive update from Samson Mow, the vocal CEO of JAN3 and a Bitcoin advocate. He reveals a delightful prediction: Bitcoin could soar to $1 million per coin in a matter of weeks to months. In a recent interview , Mow outlined his concept of “hyperbitcoinization,” a transformative change in which Bitcoin emerges as a fundamental element of the global financial system. As fiat currencies jiggle and countries are coining forward to adopt crypto, Mow’s vision is enchanting both investors and skeptics. The $1 Million Bitcoin Scenario Explained Mow’s prediction relies on a sudden and steep increase, rather than a gradual rise. He describes the rise as a “brief and fierce surge” that might push Bitcoin’s worth to $1 million. “ They don’t gradually fail, they fail spectacularly “, Mow stated, citing fiat currencies, indicating the increasing global economic turmoil. With inflation reducing faith in traditional currency, Bitcoin’s decentralized features place it as a refuge, placing its worth at unmatched levels. Hyperbitcoinization: Governments Quietly Joining In Mow believes governments are already preparing for this shift. One example he gave is Bhutan, which has been mining Bitcoin since 2019. Today, its Bitcoin holdings are reportedly worth close to one trillion dollars – a signal, he says, that hyperbitcoinization is already underway. Violent upheaval is the most likely scenario. #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/Ibk5qtOVgi — Samson Mow (@Excellion) July 8, 2025 Countries with abundant energy resources are in a unique position, Mow explained. They can use their excess energy to mine Bitcoin, boost their reserves, and use the funds to pay down debt or support national projects. This, he believes, could help some nations stabilize their economies while shifting toward a Bitcoin-based financial model. Bitcoin Bonds Could Redefine Sovereign Debt Mow also sees a future where governments begin issuing Bitcoin-backed sovereign debt. This could lead to a new kind of global Bitcoin Bond market. He pointed to MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, whose company has used Bitcoin to raise funds successfully. That strategy, Mow said, could soon be adopted by countries. “It’s simply a matter of time before every country pulls that trigger,” Mow asserted. If that happens, Bitcoin’s demand and price could rise sharply, pushing it toward that $1 million mark. What’s Next for Bitcoin? With global uncertainty growing and more governments exploring Bitcoin, Mow’s vision of hyperbitcoinization may not be far off. If countries begin using Bitcoin to back their reserves or issue debt, the cryptocurrency could shift from being just an investment to becoming a core part of the global economy. Whether Bitcoin hits $1 million remains to be seen but the pieces, according to Mow, are already falling into place.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-to-1-million-in-months-samson-mow-reveals-shocking-scenario/,"BTC|FIAT|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING","News",cryptocompare
2025-07-09T09:57:00,"Eigen Labs lays off employees to focus on EigenCloud growth, EIGEN rallies","Cryptocurrencies performed well on Wednesday, with Bitcoin steady despite the new tariff wave . Eigen Labs’ native token has turned bullish amidst the optimism, possibly driven by the latest ecosystem announcement. According to Blockworks , EigenLayer’s team has reduced its workforce by laying off roughly 25% of the staff, 29 employees. The move is part of a strategic plan to streamline operations and ensure laser focus on the new developer platform, EigenCloud. Meanwhile, this comes after the crypto firm launched EigenCloud in mid-June to explore on- and off-chain verification, a sector gaining increased traction as blockchain integrates with AI. Eigen Labs CEO Sreeram Kannan commented on the decision, stating: While today’s reorganisation is painful, I’m extremely optimistic about our future. Demand for verifiable computing is growing as developers build software for the AI era, and EigenCloud is uniquely positioned to service this market need with a cloud platform backed by billions in stake and thousands of operators around the world. While financial challenges often trigger substantial layoffs, Eigen Labs emphasizes it’s not the case. A strategic pivot and not a financial calamity Eigen’s latest layoffs are part of the company’s long-term strategy and not a response to a financial crisis. The company boasts monetary stability. Venture capital firm A16z supported the project with $70 million during the EigenCloud launch, adding to its previous investments. Eigen Labs has raised $220 million, including the $50 million Series A funding in 2023 Kannan highlighted that they are aiming to reorganize resources around EigenCloud and streamline the team to fuel long-term growth. While the decision could be painful, Kannan trusts it was necessary. He expressed gratitude to the departing team, who have been key in building Eigen Lab’s early stages. The firm will support the impacted employees with accelerated token vesting and a 3-month base salary. Also, Eigen Labs promised career support to help ex-staff gain stability. Understanding EigenCloud: why does it matter? EigenCloud is a developer-centric platform offering verifiable compute tools to support advanced decentralized applications (dApps). It enables developers to create software with enhanced transparency and trust, elements gaining attention as blockchain and AI blend. Distinguishing machine-generated and real things can be challenging as artificial intelligence gains rapid popularity. EigenCloud aims to meet the growing demand for verifiable computing through its global network of operators and stakers. EIGEN price outlook The native token flashed bullish sentiment amidst the layoff news. EIGEN trades at $1.15 after gaining more than 4% in the past 24 hours. Its daily trading volume has increased by over 60%, signaling revived interest in the altcoin. Chart by CoinMarketCap Short-term technical indicators also suggest buyer resurgence, positioning EIGEN for extended gains. Meanwhile, broad market sentiment will likely influence its trajectory in the coming sessions.

2025-07-09T09:50:14,"Digital Asset Oversight: Crucial Senate Hearing Set to Shape US Crypto Policy","The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with anticipation as a significant date approaches on the U.S. political calendar. A crucial Senate Hearing on Digital Asset Oversight has been scheduled, promising to be a pivotal moment for the future of the digital economy. This isn’t just another discussion; it’s an opportunity for stakeholders to voice their perspectives directly to policymakers, potentially laying the groundwork for clearer, more comprehensive Crypto Regulation in the United States. What’s on the Agenda for This Pivotal Senate Hearing? According to Eleanor Terrett, host of Crypto In America, the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition & Forestry has set July 15 for a hearing titled “Stakeholder Perspectives on Federal Oversight of Digital Commodities.” This title itself offers a glimpse into the committee’s focus: understanding how various parties view the regulation of digital assets that fall under the commodity classification. But why the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition & Forestry? It might seem counterintuitive at first glance. However, this committee oversees the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which has a primary role in regulating commodity markets, including derivatives. Many in the crypto space, particularly those dealing with assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, argue that these are commodities, not securities. Therefore, the CFTC, under the purview of this committee, is a key player in determining their regulatory fate. The hearing aims to gather insights from a broad spectrum of stakeholders. This means we can expect representatives from: Crypto Industry: Exchanges, developers, blockchain companies, and advocacy groups. Financial Institutions: Banks, investment firms, and traditional finance players exploring digital assets. Consumer Protection Advocates: Groups focused on safeguarding investors and users. Academic Experts: Researchers and legal scholars specializing in digital assets and financial technology. Government Agencies: Though not directly testifying, their perspectives will certainly influence the discussions. The outcome of such a Senate Hearing could significantly impact how Digital Commodities are traded, custodied, and integrated into the broader financial system. Why is Clear Crypto Regulation So Crucial for US Crypto Policy? The current regulatory landscape for digital assets in the U.S. is often described as a patchwork, leading to confusion and uncertainty. This fragmented approach has hindered innovation for some and left investors vulnerable in other instances. The primary debate often centers around whether a digital asset is a security (under the SEC’s purview) or a commodity (under the CFTC’s). This lack of clarity creates significant challenges: Regulatory Arbitrage: Businesses may seek jurisdictions with more favorable or less stringent rules. Investor Protection Gaps: Without clear rules, consumers might not be adequately protected from fraud or market manipulation. Innovation Stifled: Companies may hesitate to develop new products or services due to uncertain legal frameworks. Market Instability: Unregulated markets can be more volatile and prone to sudden shifts. A unified and comprehensive approach to Crypto Regulation is essential for fostering a healthy, secure, and innovative digital asset ecosystem. This hearing is a vital step towards addressing these complexities and shaping a coherent US Crypto Policy that balances growth with consumer safety. Understanding the Landscape of Digital Asset Oversight The concept of Digital Asset Oversight extends beyond just classifying assets. It involves a holistic approach to managing risks, promoting innovation, and ensuring market integrity. This includes aspects like: Licensing and Registration: Determining which entities need to register with which regulators. Custody Rules: How digital assets are securely stored and managed. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) & Know Your Customer (KYC): Preventing illicit financial activities. Market Surveillance: Monitoring for manipulation and ensuring fair trading practices. Taxation: Clarifying how digital asset transactions are taxed. Each of these areas presents its own set of challenges and requires careful consideration. The stakeholders presenting at the hearing will likely bring diverse perspectives on how best to implement effective Digital Asset Oversight without stifling the nascent industry’s potential. The goal is to build a regulatory framework that supports legitimate innovation while weeding out bad actors and protecting everyday users. What Does This Mean for the Future of Digital Commodities? The hearing’s specific focus on “ Digital Commodities ” signals a recognition of their distinct nature from traditional securities. This distinction is crucial because it determines which regulatory body has primary jurisdiction and what rules apply. If a clear framework for digital commodities emerges, it could: Boost Institutional Adoption: Clarity encourages more traditional financial institutions to enter the space. Enhance Market Liquidity: Increased participation can lead to deeper and more stable markets. Facilitate New Products: Clear rules enable the development of regulated derivatives, ETFs, and other financial products. Reduce Legal Uncertainty: Companies operating with digital commodities would have a clearer path for compliance. The outcome of this hearing, and subsequent legislative efforts, will significantly influence how assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum are treated within the U.S. financial system. It could pave the way for more robust, regulated markets for Digital Commodities , benefiting both investors and the broader economy. Actionable Insights for Navigating US Crypto Policy Changes For individuals and businesses involved in the digital asset space, staying informed about evolving US Crypto Policy is paramount. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Follow legislative developments, regulatory announcements, and industry news closely. Resources like official government websites, reputable crypto news outlets, and industry analyses are invaluable. Engage with Policymakers: If you’re a business or an active participant, consider supporting advocacy groups that represent your interests. Your voice, collectively, can influence policy direction. Prepare for Compliance: Assume that more regulation is coming. Businesses should start reviewing their operations to ensure they can adapt to new compliance requirements related to licensing, AML, and reporting. Understand Your Assets: Know whether the digital assets you hold or deal with are likely to be classified as securities or commodities, as this dictates their regulatory treatment. Seek Expert Advice: Consult with legal and financial professionals who specialize in digital assets to navigate complex regulatory landscapes. The path to comprehensive US Crypto Policy is a marathon, not a sprint. This hearing is a significant milestone, but the journey will require ongoing dialogue, collaboration, and adaptation from all sides. A Defining Moment for Digital Assets The upcoming U.S. Senate hearing on Digital Asset Oversight on July 15 is more than just a procedural event; it’s a defining moment for the digital asset industry. By gathering diverse stakeholder perspectives on Digital Commodities , the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition & Forestry is taking a critical step towards establishing a clearer, more predictable framework for Crypto Regulation . The discussions held and the insights gained from this Senate Hearing will undoubtedly play a crucial role in shaping future US Crypto Policy . While challenges remain, the commitment to open dialogue offers hope for a balanced regulatory environment that fosters innovation, protects consumers, and integrates digital assets into the mainstream financial system responsibly. The future of digital finance in the U.S. hangs in the balance, and this hearing is a testament to its growing importance.

2025-07-09T09:45:52,"Why are companies turning to Ethereum treasuries?","Several companies are placing bets on treasury strategies that involve Ethereum (ETH), as more institutions take up positions on the world’s second-largest crypto. ETH was trading up 2% on the day at $2,624 at the time of writing, having failed to break past the $2,600 resistance level late last week. Ethereum has gone up over 7% in the past week and is up 2.8% intraday. According to market analysts, even with institutional involvement, the asset is still trading within a tight range, locked in a sideways channel that has persisted for two months. Speaking on CNBC’s Squawk Box, Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin recently said corporate interest in Ethereum is climbing because they want to “tell the Ethereum story.” “What does Wall Street pay attention to? It pays attention to being able to make money,” he reckoned. GameSquare holdings commences $100 Million ETH treasury plan According to a July 8 press statement , GameSquare Holdings announced the launch of an ETH-based treasury strategy, against the backdrop of a partnership with crypto capital management firm Dialectic. The news took the company’s stock 0.57% upwards of its Tuesday closing session price, now changing hands at $1.54, according to Google Finance data . GameSquare’s Board has approved a total ETH allocation of up to $100 million, which will be deployed in stages while providing liquidity for ongoing operations. The ETH-focused treasury is built on Dialectic’s proprietary Medici platform, which integrates machine learning, automated optimization, and risk management systems. GameSquare is targeting annual yields of 8-14%, well above the current staking benchmarks of 3-4%. To help fund the Ether acquisitions, GameSquare launched a public offering of over 8.4 million shares at $0.95 per share to raise approximately $8 million. The offering was filed under a registration statement declared effective by the SEC on June 4 and is expected to close by July 9. SharpLink acquires over $533 million in ETH Another Media and Sports betting technology company, SharpLink Gaming, disclosed on Tuesday that it now holds 205,634 ETH, valued at more than $533 million, bought between June 28 and July 4. NEW: SharpLink now holds ~205,634 ETH Between June 28 and July 4, SharpLink acquired ~7,689 ETH for ~$19.2M at an average price of ~$2,501 per ETH During that same period, the company raised an additional ~$64.2M through its ATM facility, selling ~5.4M shares SharpLink has… pic.twitter.com/bhS0K1ZBul — SBET (SharpLink Gaming) (@SharpLinkGaming) July 8, 2025 During that period, SharpLink purchased 7,689 ETH for over $19 million at an average price of $2,501 per token. As reported by Cryptopolitan, SharpLink’s stock rallied 7% after announcing a $30 million Ether purchase on June 25, bringing its holdings to 188,000 ETH. The company has committed all of its Ether holdings to staking and restaking protocols, earning 322 ETH in rewards, worth roughly $848,750, since June 2. SharpLink raised $64 million in net proceeds to fund the ETH investments, by selling more than 5.4 million shares. In May, it filed plans to sell up to $1 billion in common stock, with the bulk of the proceeds earmarked for more ETH acquisitions. Lubin, who is SharpLink’s chairman, said the strategy is rooted in financial discipline and transparency. “Our sustained success is a direct result of SharpLink’s disciplined execution of its ETH-centric treasury management strategy,” he remarked. Lubin explained that adding ETH to corporate treasuries helps to reduce excess Ether supply and could eventually create positive price pressure. Bit Digital goes all-in on Ethereum Meanwhile, earlier this week, Nasdaq-listed Bit Digital has completely exited its Bitcoin holdings in favor of Ethereum. The company sold all of its BTC assets, raising $172 million in the process, and used the funds to acquire more than 100,000 ETH. After buying Ethereum, Bit Digital is reportedly one of the largest corporate Ethereum treasury firms globally. “We believe Ethereum has the ability to rewrite the entire financial system.” CEO Sam Tabar told reporters earlier this week. “We are starting with exposure to over 100K ETH for now, but we intend to aggressively add more so we become the preeminent ETH holding company in the world.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.
