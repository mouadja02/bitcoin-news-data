2025-07-09T13:57:18,"Profitability Rates for Long-Term Bitcoin Investors Approach Critical Level! Could Selling Pressure Be Possible? Here Are the Details","According to crypto analysts, long-term Bitcoin investors (LTH) are making 215% more profit than their average cost, which could trigger a potential sell-off. Long-Term Bitcoin Investors Approach Critical Profitability Threshold: Is a Market Sell-Off Imminent? Data shows that long-term investors typically sell after exceeding the 300% return threshold, taking profits. Currently, while investors are still far from this threshold, the market has entered a critical zone between “steady profit-taking” and “risk of a sharp sell-off.” This type of investor behavior typically signals a market turning point, and analysts warn that significant Bitcoin price volatility could occur if large-scale profit-taking begins at these levels. According to experts, despite investor pressure to take profits, the overall market structure remains strong. However, if the 300% profitability threshold is breached, particularly if combined with macroeconomic conditions or negative news flow, there could be significant selling by long-term investors. This could lead to a sharp correction in Bitcoin's price. In summary, the market is currently on the cusp between a controlled profit-taking and a long-term sell-off. The coming weeks will be critical for investors to determine which direction this threshold will be crossed. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-09T13:56:07,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Marginally Up As Markets Wait For Next Catalyst","Bitcoin (BTC) price action picked up during the ongoing session, with the flagship cryptocurrency up nearly 1% as buyers attempted to cross the crucial $110,000 mark. BTC started the week in the red, dropping nearly 1% on Monday before recovering on Tuesday, rising from a low of $107,446 to $108,938. The price is up almost 1% during the ongoing session, trading around $109,516. Remixpoint Moves To Align CEO With Bitcoin Strategy Remixpoint has announced that new CEO Takashi Tashiro will be paid in Bitcoin as part of efforts to be “in the same boat” as shareholders. The company said it will calculate Tashiro’s salary and taxes, purchase the equivalent amount in BTC , and transfer it to a wallet Tashiro chooses. According to the company, the move is part of a “shareholder-oriented management.” “The remuneration in this case will be paid in Japanese yen in format based on the appropriate organization of the Company Act and taxation. On top of that, we plan to acquire Bitcoin (BTC) equivalent to the same amount at the market price with Japanese yen, which is equivalent to the full amount of the payment, and deliver it to the crypto asset wallet designated by the President and CEO.” Tashiro took over as Remixpoint CEO in June, stating the firm will put BTC at the heart of its financial strategy. H100 Raises $54 Million For Bitcoin Treasury H100 Group AB, a Swedish health-tech firm focusing on AI-driven health solutions, has closed two key funding rounds, raising $54 million. The firm raised capital via a directed share issue (Tranche 6, issuing 27.17 million shares at SEK 6.38), and a directed convertible debenture issue (Tranche 7, SEK 342.3 million. The directed share issue diluted existing shareholders by around 10%. However, if all convertible shares from Tranche 7 are converted, it could cause an additional dilution of around 14%. The company plans to use the funds for its Bitcoin treasury strategy. The funding comes after H100 secured a $15.82 million convertible loan guarantee from Blockstream CEO Adam Beck to help accelerate its planned Bitcoin acquisitions. This followed a $2.2 million raise in May, also led by Beck. Other investors in this round included Crafoord Capital Partners and Morten Klein. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is up almost 1% during the ongoing session as buyers eye a move past $110,000. The flagship cryptocurrency ended the weekend positively, rising nearly 1% on Sunday to settle at $109,231. Despite the positive close to the weekend, BTC lost momentum on Monday, dropping 0.88% and settling at $108,273. It fell to a low of $107,446 on Tuesday but rebounded, rising 0.61% to reclaim $108,000 and settle at $108,938 before reclaiming $109,000 during the ongoing session. With momentum building, traders are optimistic about a move to $110,000. However, blockchain analytics platform Santiment has warned that optimism isn’t always a positive sign. Santiment analyst Brian Quinlivan stated, “It’s pretty clear that the crowd is starting to salivate over a potential $110K+ Bitcoin market value.” Santiment analyzed social media chatter about Bitcoin and found that for every bearish comment for the flagship cryptocurrency, there were 1.51 bullish comments. Santiment based its findings on data from several platforms, including X, Reddit, 4chan, Telegram, BitcoinTalk, and Farcaster. The analytics platform cautioned that similar optimism was followed by substantial declines on two previous occasions. “As we know, prices move in the opposite direction of the crowd’s expectations as retail perpetually loses money from overly emotional decisions.” Santiment believes BTC will experience a pullback before breaking through its all-time high of $111,970, set on May 22. Santiment analysts also highlighted that Bitcoin whale wallets have shown little activity in recent sessions, indicating caution. “For now, these wallets have been somewhat suspiciously flat. When they accumulate, prices often follow closely. When they dump or even just temporarily stop accumulating, it often signals that market values across crypto may see some declines.” BTC ended the previous weekend on a bullish note, rising nearly 1% to close at $108,350. Despite the positive weekend, it lost momentum on Monday, dropping 1.09% to $107,168. Selling pressure intensified on Tuesday as BTC fell 1.33%, slipping below $106,000 and settling at $105,740. Despite the selling pressure, the price recovered on Wednesday, rising nearly 3% to $108,845. Buyers retained control on Thursday as the price reached an intraday high of $110,583 before settling at $109,650, ultimately registering a 0.74% increase. Price action was back in bearish territory on Friday, dropping 1.42% to $108,097.

According to a July 9 disclosure , Remixpoint has secured 31.5 billion yen, worth approximately $215 million, through its latest round of financing. Every yen of the funds will go toward buying more Bitcoin ( BTC ) purchases, boosting the accumulation streak it commenced back in 2024. The company also revealed its short-term mission, which is to grow its holdings to 3,000 BTC. Per its statement, the actual number of coins acquired will depend on Bitcoin’s market price and Remixpoint’s stock performance, as purchase prices will be based on the average share value across three consecutive trading days post-transaction. Remixpoint added that its reseve decision followed a lengthy internal debate. While opinions among leadership were divided, the board ultimately agreed that expanding BTC exposure is the right move to push the company into its next growth stage.

2025-07-09T13:30:20,"Ethereum Price Action Signals Momentum Shift: BTC Sleeps And ETH Moves","Ethereum has finally pushed above the critical $2,600 level after weeks of range-bound trading, marking a potential turning point in its price structure. This breakout comes as bullish momentum builds, with Ethereum now preparing for a possible expansion toward the $2,800 resistance level—a zone that has repeatedly rejected upward attempts since early May. The coming days will be decisive in shaping Ethereum’s short-term trajectory, especially if bulls manage to drive the price beyond this key barrier. Related Reading: ERC-20 Stablecoin Supply Hits All-Time High At $121B – Liquidity On The Rise A breakout above $2,800 would not only signal renewed strength in Ethereum but could also catalyze a broader altcoin rally. Market sentiment is gradually shifting, with traders growing more optimistic amid easing macroeconomic pressures and signs of renewed risk appetite. Top analyst Ted Pillows recently shared an Ethereum chart showing a clear upward breakout from compression. This technical pattern typically precedes strong directional moves, and in this case, it favors the bulls. Pillows suggests that Ethereum is taking the lead while Bitcoin remains in consolidation, indicating that ETH may be setting the pace for the next phase of the crypto cycle. All eyes are now on the $2,800 level, which could unlock significant upside if breached. Ethereum Leads the Charge: Major Move Ahead Since early May, Ethereum has traded within a tight consolidation range between $2,400 and $2,700, unable to break out despite several attempts. This extended period of sideways action has built up pressure, and market participants widely expect the next move to be significant. Bulls have shown resilience, defending demand levels and keeping ETH above the $2,500 mark for several weeks. However, a clear breakout above critical resistance is still needed to confirm a broader bullish trend. Altcoins continue to struggle, with most still trading below key resistance levels. Many analysts agree that a sustained Ethereum breakout is the missing trigger for the long-awaited altseason. Market leadership from ETH has historically marked the start of major altcoin rallies, and the current setup could be no different. Top analyst Ted Pillows shared a 4-hour chart highlighting an upward breakout from a compression pattern just above $2,600. According to Pillow’s analysis, Ethereum is leading the market while Bitcoin remains in a holding pattern below all-time highs. This leadership role for ETH could signal a shift in capital toward altcoins, especially if Ethereum follows through and breaks the $2,800 resistance level. Related Reading: Ethereum Turns Key Resistance Into Support – Momentum Builds For Range Breakout ETH Price Analysis: Upward Momentum Builds Above $2,600 Ethereum (ETH) is showing renewed strength after breaking above the key $2,600 level. The 12-hour chart reveals a bullish structure forming, with ETH currently trading at $2,612.61. This move follows a sustained period of consolidation between $2,400 and $2,600, where buyers consistently defended lower levels. Now, Ethereum is printing higher lows and gradually reclaiming its moving averages. Price is now trading above the 50-period and 100-period simple moving averages (SMAs), currently positioned at $2,483.37 and $2,536.77, respectively. This alignment is bullish and suggests ETH is building momentum for a potential retest of the $2,700–$2,800 resistance zone. A successful break above this area would confirm the breakout from compression and open the door for a more significant rally.

According to a July 9 announcement , Emirates has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Crypto.com to integrate digital payments into its services. The rollout will begin with Crypto.com Pay, allowing customers to use cryptocurrency as a payment option for flights and other transactions. The agreement was formalized in Dubai, witnessed by Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, Chairman and CEO of Emirates Airline & Group.

The partnership builds on its earlier interest in crypto payments dating back to 2022, when COO Adel Ahmed Al-Redha had floated plans to accept Bitcoin (BTC) shortly after the UAE introduced crypto-friendly regulations. Commenting on the deal, Emirates’ Deputy President and Chief Commercial Officer Adnan Kazim said the airline sees growing demand and momentum around crypto as a legitimate payment method, especially among tech-driven travelers. “Partnering with Crypto.com to integrate cryptocurrency into our digital payments system reflects Emirates’ commitment to meeting evolving customer preferences, in addition to tapping into younger, tech-savvy customer segments who prefer digital currencies,” he said. Crypto.com President and COO Eric Anziani added that the partnership marks another step in expanding real-world use cases for crypto payments, and will drive momentum for the broader digital asset industry. The feature is expected to go live next year, once internal readiness and regulatory approvals are in place. Both Emirates and Crypto.com will also explore leveraging promotional marketing campaigns to create awareness and encourage adoption of this new payment solution.

2025-07-09T13:15:22,"New ATH in view as SPX6900 (SPX) breaks out from a critical pattern","SPX6900 (SPX) is in the spotlight after staging a powerful breakout that now has traders eyeing a potential new all-time high. Over the past 24 hours, the memecoin surged 8.7%, signalling a bullish continuation that’s drawing renewed attention across both technical and derivatives markets. Today’s price surge comes as SPX6900 sees a rare convergence of bullish signals, including an ascending triangle breakout, a golden cross, strong volume expansion, and a textbook Cup & Handle pattern, all of which point toward the possibility of explosive upside in the near term. Ascending triangle breakout sparks optimism Since June 20, SPX6900 has been consolidating within an ascending triangle in the 4-hour chart, a classic bullish structure marked by rising lows and a flat resistance ceiling. That resistance level, clearly defined at $1.38, held firm until July 9 when the token broke through decisively, backed by solid volume and a bounce from the 100-day moving average at $1.22. SPX6900 (SPX) ascending triangle breakout | Source: TradingView Following the breakout, SPX tapped $1.4476 and is currently stabilising around $1.42, with traders closely watching for a retest of the $1.38 level to confirm this move. If the token successfully holds above this key support, analysts anticipate a potential push toward $1.86, which would validate the triangle’s measured move projection. Golden cross confirms SPX’s bullish setup Adding to the ascending triangle breakout is the confirmed golden cross, where the 50-day exponential moving average has crossed above the 200-day EMA. SPX6900 (SPX) breaks out from a critical pattern | Source: TradingView This powerful technical signal, now visible on the daily chart, typically marks the beginning of a sustained bullish trend, and it arrives just as the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) histogram flipped positive for the first time since June. Momentum indicators now align in favour of buyers, especially with volume climbing steadily and derivatives markets flashing green. Open interest, according to Coinalyze, has also surged by over 18% to $103.7 million at press time, with an overwhelming 82% of those positions favouring longs, signalling growing institutional confidence. Recent SPX6900 (SPX) listing on Tokocrypto is fueling the buying pressure Another catalyst driving SPX’s price surge is its recent listing on Tokocrypto , which opened the token to a wider audience across Southeast Asia. This strategic move came on July 8 and led to a sharp 75.8% spike in 24-hour trading volume, now sitting at over $91 million. The increased accessibility has not only deepened liquidity but also amplified momentum during a week when memecoins have outperformed broader altcoins. As Bitcoin (BTC) edged lower by 0.36%, money flowed into smaller-cap assets like SPX6900 (SPX), which gained favour during this shift in market sentiment. Cup & handle pattern signals more upside Perhaps most compelling is the Cup & Handle pattern now forming on SPX6900’s daily chart, offering a roadmap for a potential breakout toward $2.50 or higher. The rounded bottom of the cup is already in place, and the handle, a narrow consolidation range, indicates a healthy pause before a renewed push upward. SPX6900 (SPX) cup and handle formation | Source: TradingView Volume has been gradually building, and traders are now on alert for a breakout candle that could serve as the final trigger. If confirmed, the pattern’s measured move projects nearly a 98% gain from current levels, pushing SPX close to the $2.70 resistance zone. SPX6900 price outlook: crowded longs pose short-term risks Despite the overwhelmingly bullish picture, traders are keeping a close eye on one potential red flag, crowded long positioning. With funding rates rising to their highest point since mid-June and the majority of traders paying premiums to hold longs, the market is vulnerable to sharp corrections. While RSI remains in neutral territory at 56.18, suggesting there’s still room for upside, any failure to hold $1.38 could result in a fakeout and trap late buyers. However, with SPX6900’s current all-time high sitting at $1.73, set just under a month ago, the current price action puts a fresh breakout within striking distance. Traders are now watching whether the Cup & Handle formation will resolve to the upside, which could not only breach the ATH but also set the stage for a major rally through the $2 range.

Through SharpLink Gaming, which he chairs, Lubin is spearheading efforts to accumulate large amounts of ETH. He describes these treasuries as essential for creating scarcity and driving long-term value. SharpLink recently boosted its ETH holdings to over 205,000 tokens worth $533 million, which resulted in a 28% surge in its stock price. Meanwhile, ReserveOne is set to go public through a $1 billion SPAC merger to help expand its own crypto reserve strategy. Joseph Lubin Pushes Ethereum Treasuries Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Joseph Lubin recently talked about the importance of ETH treasuries when it comes to driving the growth and sustainability of the Ethereum ecosystem. In a recent interview with CNBC, Lubin explained that while a big amount of ETH is in circulation, there is not enough usage to support healthy supply-demand dynamics. To address this imbalance, he is spearheading efforts at SharpLink Gaming, a company he chairs that aims to build Ethereum-based treasuries. Lubin described Ether treasuries as a “great business to run” and essential to making the Ethereum economy function more efficiently. SharpLink’s mission, according to Lubin, is to help communicate the Ethereum narrative in a way that resonates with traditional finance, particularly Wall Street investors who are increasingly seeking profitable opportunities in digital assets. He argued that ETH treasuries can play a pivotal role in generating both interest and scarcity around Ethereum by acquiring and holding large amounts. “We’re able to acquire tens of millions of dollars in Ether a day,” Lubin pointed out, suggesting that this accumulation will drive long-term value. Lubin is very confident in the future of both Bitcoin and Ethereum, and stated that he expects both assets to appreciate over the coming years and decades as global systems gradually decentralize. He also believes that the Ethereum network is now equipped to support Web3 development at scale, and called it “scalable enough, affordable enough, legal enough in the United States.” This is a shift from earlier challenges the network faced, including regulatory uncertainties. On the regulatory front, Lubin criticized the former SEC Chair Gary Gensler for hindering the Ethereum ecosystem’s development by creating a climate that discouraged token issuance and application building. He believes those constraints are now lifted, thanks to Gensler’s recent departure and the appointment of Paul Atkins. Paul Atkins Atkins became the 34th chair of the SEC in April, and signaled a much more favorable stance toward blockchain innovation. Overall, Lubin’s comments suggest that this regulatory thaw could be the start of a new wave of growth for Ethereum and the Web3 space. SharpLink Stock Soars on ETH Buys Shareholders of the Lubin-chaired SharpLink also seem to agree that an Ethereum treasury is the way to go. Shares in SharpLink Gaming surged by over 28% on Tuesday after the company revealed that it increased its Ethereum holdings to 205,634 ETH, valued at more than $533 million. The announcement revealed a buying spree between June 28 and July 4, during which SharpLink acquired 7,689 ETH for over $19 million at an average price of $2,501. The stock closed at $16.29 and rose even more during after-hours to $17. Sharplink Gaming share price over the past 24 hours (Source: Google Finance ) This recent purchase took place after a similar move on June 25, when SharpLink’s shares climbed 7% to $9.66 after it announced a $30 million Ether acquisition that boosted its holdings to 188,000 ETH. SharpLink has made it very clear that its treasury strategy is focused squarely on Ethereum. During the latest accumulation period, the company raised $64 million in net proceeds by selling more than 5.4 million shares, with a large portion of the capital earmarked for further Ether purchases. On May 30, SharpLink disclosed plans to sell up to $1 billion in common shares, primarily to fund future Ethereum buys. This came just days after a formal announcement on May 27 that the firm was shifting toward an Ethereum-focused treasury strategy. Despite a sharp 73% drop in after-hours trading on June 12, it seems like the company was able to regain investor confidence with its consistent ETH accumulation. SharpLink also staked all of its Ether holdings, earning 322 ETH in rewards since June 2, which is currently worth approximately $848,750. Additionally, the company introduced a new metric, ETH Concentration, to highlight its Ether exposure in relation to its equity structure. Joseph Lubin stated that the company continues to refine its treasury strategy and attributes its success to a disciplined ETH-centric approach and a strong commitment to transparency. SharpLink’s bold move is part of the growing trend among companies allocating corporate treasuries into crypto assets. While Bitcoin is still a popular choice, some firms are opting for altcoins. Bit Digital, for instance, announced on Monday that it sold 280 Bitcoin to pivot its treasury toward Ethereum. Merger Fuels ReserveOne Crypto Strategy ReserveOne, a digital asset management company, is set to go public through a merger with M3-Brigade Acquisition V Corp.. This is according to an announcement made on Tuesday. The deal is projected to bring in more than $1 billion in gross proceeds, which will be used to boost ReserveOne’s crypto reserve strategy. This strategy focuses on accumulating a range of digital assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, as part of its long-term investment thesis. Jaime Leverton, CEO of ReserveOne, described the move as a step toward reinforcing the company’s dedication to responsible innovation, financial inclusion, and the advancement of a more transparent and resilient digital asset market. Leverton is widely recognized in the cryptocurrency industry for her leadership roles at Bitcoin mining firms Hut 8 and Riot Platforms. She served as CEO of Hut 8 for three years and currently sits on the board of directors at Riot Platforms. Jaime Leverton M3-Brigade Acquisition V Corp. is part of a joint venture between M3 Partners and Brigade Capital Management. The firm specializes in Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs), a model that allows companies to go public through private mergers. M3-Brigade previously brought Greenfire Resources and Infrastructure and Energy Alternatives to public markets using this strategy. Once the merger is finalized, ReserveOne will be listed on Nasdaq and trade under the tickers RONE and RONEW. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025. Crypto reserve companies like ReserveOne have become increasingly popular since 2024, by offering investors a way to gain exposure to digital assets without directly holding tokens. Other companies following similar strategies include Michael Saylor’s Strategy, Metaplanet, Semler Scientific, SOL Strategies, and DeFi Development Corp.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9867/lubin-backs-eth-treasuries-to-boost-ecosystem-use,"ETH|REGULATION|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

2025-07-09T13:08:39,"Patterns Break as Both Short and Long Term Holder Cohorts Accumulate Bitcoin","As bitcoin BTC continues a now multi-week consolidation just below its all-time high of $112,000, an interesting accumulation phenomenon is occurring. Both short-term and long-term holders have been increasing their stacks as distinct cohorts, which is unusual because these groups typically act in opposite directions, according to Glassnode data. The chart below from Glassnode illustrates the 155-day threshold used to classify coins as belonging to Long-Term Holders (LTH) or Short-Term Holders (STH). Since June 22, the LTH supply has increased by 13,000 BTC, returning to an all-time high of 14,713,345 BTC. Meanwhile, over the same period, STHs have grown their BTC supply by more than 60,000 BTC and now hold over 2.3 million BTC. According to Glassnode data, LTH and STH cohorts usually diverge because LTHs often sell into bull market strength, while STHs tend to buy amid market greed and euphoria. This alignment suggests that both groups of market participants are expecting higher prices. If both cohorts continue increasing their supply, there is a strong possibility that all-time highs will be surpassed.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/09/patterns-break-as-both-short-and-long-term-holder-cohorts-accumulate-bitcoin,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING","Markets|Glassnode|Bitcoin|News",cryptocompare

2025-07-09T13:01:44,"Bitcoin (BTC) Price Surge Incoming: Why Patience Will Pay Off","Many Bitcoin investors must be wondering when, and even if, $BTC will finally lift-off and head higher into the next stage of price growth. $BTC has emerged from the top of its bull flag, but there is still no sign of a price surge. That said, holding firm rewards those who are patient. It’s just a matter of time For those investors who are worried about their Bitcoin positions, it must be borne in mind that just about every box has been ticked on the bullish check sheet. Yes, the price is still not moving in any major way since emerging out of a 6-week long bull flag, but it’s really just a matter of time. $BTC breakout on short-term time frame Source: TradingView In fact, looking at the short-term time frame, it can be seen that the $BTC price has just broken through the descending trendline formed by the tops of the previous two attempts to leave the bull flag. If this current surge can get above $110,600 it will take out the previous local high, made at the mid-point of the bull flag. From there, it would be expected for the price to go on and surpass the all-time high. Could the all-time high be threatened today? Source: TradingView The daily time frame puts things even more into perspective. The current candle has its base on the descending trendline and is driving higher. Depending on the price action through the rest of Wednesday, and perhaps some good news on the US trade tariffs front, the all-time high could even go today. At the bottom of the chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) illustrates that the indicator line has crossed back above the moving average (yellow line). Getting above the 60.00 level is the next target, and then a higher high at 64.00 would open the way to moving above 70.00 and into overbought territory. Bullish weekly chart for $BTC Source: TradingView The weekly chart is nothing but good news for $BTC. The breakout of the small bull flag has taken place, the confirmation of the breakout has happened, and now a decent upside move is expected. At the bottom of the chart, the RSI indicator has bounced nicely off the yellow moving average. If the indicator line can continue to climb all the way up and get above the last high at 79.00, this would negate bearish divergence, and could allow a huge price increase. At the very bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI is perfectly positioned, with the blue fast line back above the orange slow line, signalling strong upside price momentum.

2025-07-09T13:00:33,"Bitcoin RHODL Ratio: Unlocking the Next Market Phase","Are you trying to make sense of Bitcoin’s recent movements? The world of cryptocurrency is always buzzing with data, and one particular metric is currently drawing significant attention: the Bitcoin RHODL Ratio . This lesser-known but powerful indicator is signaling a potentially pivotal shift in the market, suggesting a decline in speculative activity and a move towards more stable investor behavior. If you’re an investor, a trader, or simply curious about where Bitcoin might be headed, understanding this ratio is absolutely crucial. What Exactly is the Bitcoin RHODL Ratio and Why Does it Matter? The Bitcoin RHODL Ratio, a fascinating on-chain metric, has recently climbed to its highest level in the current market cycle. This isn’t just a random number; it’s a sophisticated tool that offers a unique lens into investor psychology and market structure. Developed by Glassnode, the RHODL Ratio compares the realized value of Bitcoin held by different age groups of investors. It specifically measures the relative value of Bitcoin held by addresses that have held their coins for 6 months to 2 years . This is then compared against those holding for a much shorter period: 1 day to 3 months . Think of it as a tug-of-war between experienced, patient holders and newer, often more speculative participants. When the RHODL Ratio increases, it indicates that a larger share of Bitcoin’s realized value is now held by these medium-term investors. Conversely, it suggests that short-term activity, often associated with rapid buying and selling, remains relatively low. This balance can tell us a lot about the underlying health and maturity of the market. Decoding the Shift in the Bitcoin Market Cycle Historically, significant movements in the Bitcoin RHODL Ratio have coincided with major turning points in the Bitcoin market cycle . For instance, peaks in the ratio have often preceded or accompanied periods of consolidation or accumulation, where the market cools down after intense rallies or bottoms out after sharp corrections. The current rise in the ratio suggests we might be entering a new phase, moving away from the frenetic energy of a bull run’s peak or the panic of a bear market’s trough. What does this mean for the typical market cycle? RHODL Ratio Trend Market Phase Indication Typical Investor Behavior Rising RHODL Ratio Accumulation/Early Bull Market Medium-term investors holding, short-term selling less active. Falling RHODL Ratio Late Bull Market/Distribution Short-term investors active, taking profits, increased volatility. High RHODL Ratio Market Bottom/Early Recovery Strong conviction from long-term holders, reduced panic selling. This metric provides a valuable perspective beyond just price action, giving us insight into the underlying strength and conviction of the holders. Why is Declining Speculative Activity a Positive Sign? The core implication of a rising Bitcoin RHODL Ratio is a noticeable decline in speculative activity . When the market is dominated by short-term traders, it tends to be more volatile and prone to rapid price swings driven by emotion rather than fundamental value. This ‘froth’ can make the market unpredictable and risky for long-term investors. A reduction in this kind of activity suggests several positive developments: Increased Stability: Less speculative trading often leads to more stable price action, as fewer participants are looking to make quick profits from minor fluctuations. Stronger Foundations: It implies that Bitcoin is increasingly being held by those with a longer-term vision, indicating growing confidence in its fundamental value and future potential. Healthier Growth: Organic growth, driven by adoption and fundamental utility, is more sustainable than growth fueled purely by speculation. This shift points to a market that is maturing, where the focus is less on chasing pumps and more on accumulating a valuable asset. It’s a sign that Bitcoin might be shedding some of its ‘wild west’ image and moving towards becoming a more established asset class. The Rise of Medium-Term Investors: A Sign of Maturity? The increasing share of Bitcoin’s realized value held by medium-term investors (those holding for 6 months to 2 years) is a compelling narrative. These are not the diamond-hand HODLers who bought in 2010 and never sold, nor are they the day traders looking for a quick flip. They represent a significant cohort that has weathered market volatility, demonstrating a degree of conviction and patience. Their growing presence suggests: Experienced Holders: These investors have likely experienced at least one significant market correction or bull run, making them less prone to panic selling during dips. Belief in Long-Term Value: Holding an asset for 6 months to 2 years indicates a belief in its value beyond immediate price movements. They are likely anticipating future growth, perhaps even the next major bull cycle. Reduced Supply on Exchanges: If more coins are held in these medium-term wallets, it implies less readily available supply on exchanges, which can contribute to upward price pressure in the long run. This trend is often seen as a sign of a maturing asset. It shows that Bitcoin is attracting a broader base of investors who are willing to commit for longer periods, suggesting a growing belief in its enduring value proposition. Navigating Current Crypto Market Trends with the RHODL Ratio Understanding the Bitcoin RHODL Ratio is just one piece of the puzzle when navigating the complex landscape of crypto market trends . While the ratio points to a cooling of speculative behavior and increased stability, it’s important to consider it within the broader context of other on-chain metrics, macroeconomic factors, and technological developments. Here are some actionable insights: For Long-Term Investors: A rising RHODL Ratio might signal an opportune time for accumulation, as it suggests less short-term noise and more conviction from experienced holders. For Traders: While volatility may decrease, understanding the shift can help in identifying periods where momentum might be building more steadily, rather than explosively. For New Entrants: This period of reduced speculation could offer a less intimidating entry point into the market, as prices might be less erratic. Always combine on-chain analysis with fundamental research into Bitcoin’s adoption, network growth, and regulatory developments. No single metric tells the whole story, but the RHODL Ratio provides a powerful perspective on investor sentiment and market structure. Actionable Insights for Investors: What Should You Do? Given the signals from the Bitcoin RHODL Ratio, what concrete steps can investors consider? This metric offers a unique lens, and here’s how you might integrate it into your strategy: Re-evaluate Your Time Horizon: If the market is shifting towards medium-term holding, perhaps it’s time to align your own strategy. Are you comfortable holding for 6 months to 2 years, or even longer? This metric suggests that patience might be increasingly rewarded. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): In a market with declining speculative activity and a growing base of patient holders, DCA can be a highly effective strategy. By investing a fixed amount regularly, you average out your purchase price and reduce the impact of short-term volatility. Focus on Fundamental Analysis: While on-chain metrics are powerful, always complement them with a deep dive into Bitcoin’s fundamentals. Look at network security, adoption rates, institutional interest, and technological upgrades. A strong RHODL Ratio combined with solid fundamentals paints a very bullish picture. Manage Risk Prudently: Even with positive indicators, the crypto market remains volatile. Never invest more than you can afford to lose, and always maintain a diversified portfolio. The RHODL Ratio signals a trend, not a guarantee. Stay Informed: Continue to monitor on-chain metrics, market news, and expert analysis. The crypto landscape evolves rapidly, and staying updated is key to making informed decisions. This shift towards more stable, medium-term holding behavior could be a prime opportunity for those looking to build their Bitcoin position strategically, rather than chasing quick gains. Challenges and Considerations While the Bitcoin RHODL Ratio provides valuable insights, it’s essential to acknowledge its limitations and potential challenges: Historical Performance vs. Future Guarantees: While past trends have correlated with market shifts, history does not perfectly repeat itself. New market dynamics, regulatory changes, or unforeseen events could alter future outcomes. Defining ‘Speculative Activity’: While the ratio identifies short-term holding, not all short-term activity is purely ‘speculative’. Some may be legitimate liquidity provision or arbitrage, which are healthy for the market. Macroeconomic Factors: The RHODL Ratio is an on-chain metric. It doesn’t directly account for broader macroeconomic forces like inflation, interest rate changes, or global geopolitical events, which can significantly impact investor sentiment and capital flows into crypto. Whale Movements: Large institutional or individual holders (whales) can significantly influence the market with relatively few transactions, potentially skewing metrics if their behavior differs from the broader trend. Data Interpretation: On-chain data requires careful interpretation. While Glassnode provides robust analysis, understanding the nuances of how addresses are categorized and how ‘realized value’ is calculated is crucial for accurate conclusions. Therefore, use the RHODL Ratio as a powerful analytical tool, but always integrate it into a holistic market view that considers various factors. Conclusion: A Maturing Market on the Horizon? The climb of the Bitcoin RHODL Ratio to its highest level in the current cycle is more than just a data point; it’s a profound signal. It indicates a clear shift away from hyper-speculative short-term trading and towards a market increasingly dominated by patient, medium-term investors . This transition suggests a cooling of the ‘get rich quick’ mentality and a growing appreciation for Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. In essence, we might be witnessing a significant step in the evolution of the Bitcoin market cycle – a phase characterized by greater stability and a more solid foundation for future growth. While the world of crypto market trends remains dynamic, the RHODL Ratio offers a compelling argument that Bitcoin is maturing, attracting a more resilient investor base, and potentially setting the stage for sustainable development. This isn’t just about price; it’s about the very fabric of who holds Bitcoin and why, painting a picture of a more robust and less volatile future for the leading cryptocurrency.

2025-07-09T13:00:22,"Goldman Sachs Abruptly Raises Targets for S&P 500, Predicts Fed Cutting Rates Earlier Than Expected: Report","Analysts at the financial giant Goldman Sachs upgraded their S&P 500 projections amid new predictions for rate cuts from the U.S. Federal Reserve. Goldman Sachs Research economists say there’s more than a 50% chance of the Fed cutting rates at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in September, three months earlier than their previous prediction. Goldman economists predict 25-basis-point cuts in September, October, and December, and March and June of 2026. The upgraded forecast is due to early evidence that indicates the impact of President Donald Trump’s tariffs has been somewhat less dramatic than initially expected. David Mericle, chief US economist in Goldman Sachs Research, also notes that it has become harder to find a job in the US, though he says the labor market remains healthy overall. The CME FedWatch Tool estimates there’s a 62.7% chance the Fed will cut the rate by 25 basis points at the FOMC meeting in September. The FedWatch Tool generates probabilities using the 30-day Fed Funds futures prices. Due to the upgraded forecast, Goldman Sachs strategists raised their 12-month forecast for the S&P 500 index from 6,500 to 6,900, Bloomberg reports . They also increased their year-end target from 6,100 to 6,600. The S&P 500 is trading at 6,225.52 at time of writing. The leading index is up 0.5% in the past five days and 3.66% in the past month.

If BTC’s price holds momentum above $110,203, it will fuel a bullish rally to $111,851. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $107,130, beginning a bearish trend to $104,960. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin down today? Bitcoin faced a surge in bullish pressure as buyers accumulated heavily around recent lows. This pushed the BTC price toward $110K. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $100K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Bitcoin ETF volume is on a rising trend, recording $102.14 million in daily total net inflows on June 30, marking day 15 of a gigantic inflow streak that now totals $4.73 billion. It also marks the third consecutive month of total net inflows totaling $12.8 billion since April. Bitcoin price prediction July 2025 Bitcoin’s price jumped to $109,000, making Q2 its best quarter since 2020. In the second quarter of 2025 alone, it went up by 31%, showing strong market activity and growing investor trust. This rise is partly because, in the past, Bitcoin has often grown a lot after its “halving” events. Analysts think the current market is following the same pattern, which could mean we’ll see a peak around September 2025. Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $105,000 and be pushed further, at least $113,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $101,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction July 2025 $101,000 $105,000 $113,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491.

Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year. Bitcoin price forecast 2029 Projections for 2029 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629. The price may peak at as much as $255,321, with an average throughout the year expected to be around $200,312.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of the Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K. By the end of June, BTC price reclaimed the $108K level.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-price-prediction/,"REGULATION|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|UNI|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT","Crypto Price Predictions|BTC",cryptocompare
2025-07-09T12:58:03,"Analysts Predict Bitcoin to Hit $140K With Strong Momentum","The post Analysts Predict Bitcoin to Hit $140K With Strong Momentum appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin price is currently trading at $109,500, reflecting a 4% increase this week and a 2% rise intraday, despite the resurfacing of major dormant wallets. Recently, two wallets that had been inactive for over six years transferred a total of 8,000 BTC into a custody wallet controlled by Coinbase Prime. Additionally, data from Glassnode revealed that over 80,000 BTC, untouched for five years or more, moved last Friday. The revival of these long-dormant coins has sparked speculation about a potential market dump as Bitcoin hovers near its all-time highs. However, the market has shown little reaction, indicating strong accumulation beneath the surface. On another note, the US Dollar Index (DXY) has reached its lowest level in 21 years compared to its 200-day moving average. This weakness in the DXY is typically seen as bullish for risk assets like Bitcoin. With this increased bullish sentiment, experts are now predicting a near-term target of $140,000 for Bitcoin. Analyst Says BTC To Hit $140K Bitcoin has recently broken out of a flag pattern and is now consolidating near its upper boundary. If it clears the swing high from June, a rise to $120K appears likely in the short term. Technical indicators are also signaling bullish momentum for Bitcoin. The MACD has formed a golden cross, accompanied by a rising histogram, while the Awesome Oscillator (AO) confirms that momentum is picking up. Similarly, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicates strong and increasing money flow, reflecting positive sentiment in the market. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently above the median line at 58, suggesting that Bitcoin’s strength remains intact, with ample room to grow before entering overbought territory. Additionally, Experts are eyeing even higher short-term targets, with some suggesting a potential climb to $140K. Notably, analyst Mister Crypto has identified a bullish cup and handle pattern forming in the price action. The “cup” took shape from January to early May, while the “handle” has been developing from late May to early July. Once this pattern breaks out, Mister Crypto is targeting a parabolic move to $140K.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/analysts-predict-bitcoin-to-hit-140k-with-strong-momentum/,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|EXCHANGE|FIAT","Price Analysis|Bitcoin|Crypto news",cryptocompare
2025-07-09T12:50:06,"US Senate targets Bukele's El Salvador, bill calls to sanction BTC strategy","A group of Democratic senators has introduced a new bill that could impose sanctions on El Salvador’s leadership over its Bitcoin holdings and alleged human rights abuses. The legislation, titled the “El Salvador Accountability Act of 2025” (S. 2058), was brought before the US Senate by Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), alongside Senators Tim Kaine (D-VA) and Alex Padilla (D-CA). The bill is calling for the US to cut ties with President Nayib Bukele’s government , which became the first in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021. Liberal senators claim Bitcoin in the country is being used in corruption, sanction evasion, and human rights violations. Democrats mandate a detailed US government report Under the provisions of “S. 2058,” the US Secretary of State, in coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury, would be required to submit a report within 90 days of the bill’s enactment. The report must be released to appropriate congressional committees and question the Salvadoran government’s use of crypto. The report will analyze whether President Bukele and his officials have used digital assets “for gross corruption, graft, and evading US laws.” It would also examine the total amount of funds the government has spent purchasing Bitcoin, the exchanges used, wallet addresses, and the individuals who control these accounts. HAHAHAHAHAHAHA the Dems are just salty… https://t.co/O6CLtZuV46 — Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) July 8, 2025 Since 2021, Bukele’s government has aggressively accumulated digital assets , reportedly buying one Bitcoin per day and amassing a treasury of over 6,200 BTC. More queries will be made into the use of Bitcoin to evade international financial restrictions. The report must include an assessment of crypto being employed as a “vector to evade financial sanctions imposed on other entities,” through anonymous wallets . Other officials listed include the Vice President, Minister of Foreign Relations, Minister of Defense, Minister of Economy, and Minister of Finance. The sanctions would apply if there is credible evidence showing any of them were involved in suppressing civil liberties or aiding in illicit financial activities. One of the legal concerns raised by lawmakers is the government’s use of a “state of exception,” a law that allows for the temporary suspension of certain civil rights. According to the bill, such provisions have allegedly been misused to crack down on political dissent and civil society. US aid and political support to El Salvador under scrutiny In an interview with Fox News back in April, Democrat Representative Jamie Raskin (D-MD) said he was “frustrated” over continued American aid to El Salvador. Raskin questioned the Salvadoran government’s refusal to return Kilmar Garcia, a US citizen who was imprisoned in El Salvador. Kilmar Abrego Garcia was brought back to the United States from El Salvador on June 6, 2025, after being mistakenly deported in mid‑March. Raskin described the arrangement between the US and El Salvador as “dubious,” noting that Bukele has been receiving $6 million from America under a repatriation agreement . According to Raskin, this financial support implies legal authority, which Bukele allegedly refused to exercise by keeping Garcia in detention. “ You know, we should be talking about cutting off aid to El Salvador right now ,” Raskin said. “ The whole idea that Bukele doesn’t have any power to return an American prisoner… is ridiculous. He’s our legal agent. ” On July 7, a federal judge rejected the Justice Department’s attempt to dismiss Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s lawsuit over his mistaken deportation to El Salvador, calling one of the motions “meritless.” “You made three arguments, defendants, and none are availing… meritless,” US District Judge Paula Xinis told Justice Department attorney Bridget O’Hickey. The Salvadoran government has not formally addressed the detailed findings required by the US Senate’s bill, nor has it confirmed if it will cooperate with any investigations into its government’s crypto use.

2025-07-09T12:48:27,"Exploring the Impact of Global Trade Tensions on Cryptocurrency Markets","Recent actions by President Trump have once again brought the specter of a trade war into the global economic arena, impacting financial markets worldwide, including the realm of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Global Trade Uncertainty and Its Immediate Impact on Crypto Markets With President Trump's announcement of potential tariffs on several key trading partners, global markets experienced a downturn. The cryptocurrency market wasn't insulated from these events, as seen with Bitcoin's significant drop below $108,000, reflecting investor anxiety over the escalating trade tensions. How Bitcoin Reflects the Characteristics of a Risk Asset During Trade Wars As traditional markets took a hit, Bitcoin followed suit, demonstrating its increasing correlation with speculative assets rather than acting as a safe haven. This shift in perception is crucial for investors who traditionally viewed Bitcoin as digital gold. Technical Analysis and Market Reactions Following the unsettling news, Bitcoin's value saw a rapid decline to $107,936.08, after almost reaching a record high of $111,814. Market analysts are closely monitoring these movements, suggesting a potential trend where Bitcoin behaves similarly to tech stocks when faced with macroeconomic challenges.

2025-07-09T12:48:13,"Crypto Market Doomed? How Trump’s Trade War Could Unleash a Bitcoin Sell-Off","Key Highlights: Trump’s Tariff Blitz Shakes Markets: Fresh threats of up to 40% tariffs on multiple countries spooked global markets, sending Bitcoin tumbling below $108,000 amid rising trade war fears. Bitcoin’s Risk-Asset Status Exposed: As equities slid, Bitcoin mirrored the decline—signaling investors are treating it more like a speculative asset than a safe haven in times of geopolitical tension. All Eyes on August 1 Deadline: With Trump’s trade strategy in flux and a key tariff decision looming, crypto traders brace for volatility as Bitcoin hovers near critical support levels. Global financial markets were rocked Monday as President Donald Trump reignited fears of a global trade war, delivering a blow that spilled swiftly into the crypto world. Bitcoin, which had been building bullish momentum in recent weeks, plummeted below $108,000 in response to a cascade of tariff threats aimed at key U.S. trading partners. A Familiar Shock: Markets Recoil as Trump Resurrects Trade War Tactics Trump’s move, framed as an extension of his hardline “Liberation Day” agenda, came via letters issued to Japan and South Korea, warning of imminent 25% tariffs. The accusations were unfair trade practices and transshipping tactics used to dodge U.S. duties. While markets were still digesting this shock, the White House doubled down. By the end of the day, new tariff plans were unveiled: up to 40% on Laos and Myanmar, 30% on South Africa, and 25% on Malaysia and Kazakhstan. Trump even floated the idea of an extra 10% levy on any country aligning with BRICS—a clear swipe at Brazil, Russia, India, and China. This flurry of aggressive trade threats, coupled with legal questions surrounding Trump’s invocation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), sent investors scrambling. Risk appetite vanished, and Bitcoin—a supposed hedge against inflation and centralized disruption—was caught in the crossfire. Bitcoin Takes a Hit: Correlation with Risk Assets Tightens Just days after flirting with an all-time high of $111,814, Bitcoin (BTC) lost traction. By Monday afternoon, it slipped 0.74% to $107,936.08, echoing the broader market slide. Source: TradingView Analysts point to a concerning trend: Bitcoin, once heralded as digital gold, is behaving more like a tech stock—sensitive to macroeconomic stress and geopolitical shocks. The synchronous decline in equities and BTC suggests that in times of uncertainty, even the most resilient digital assets are being treated as risk-on plays. Technical Fragility: Bitcoin Faces Crucial Support Zones While Bitcoin’s recent dip appears modest on the surface, underlying price action paints a fragile picture. BTC currently trades near $108,000, but multiple bounces from the $107,300 area have formed a cluster of equal lows—a magnet for liquidity sweeps. A decisive break below this level could trigger a cascade of stop-loss orders, potentially dragging Bitcoin into a “fair value gap” between $107,000 and $106,300. In that case, analysts warn of a sharp drop toward $105,000 unless buyers step in swiftly. On the upside, Bitcoin remains above the 200-day EMA on the one-hour chart, keeping hopes of a bullish reversal alive. A strong recovery from below $107K—especially a clean break above the $109,500 resistance—could invalidate the bearish scenario and pave the way for a rally toward $112,000. Navigating Chaos Requires Strategy—That’s Where Outset PR Comes In In a climate where macroeconomic chaos bleeds into crypto valuations, narrative clarity and timely exposure have never been more critical. That’s why more Web3 projects are turning to Outset PR —a performance-first crypto PR agency engineered for precision and results.

Unlike firms that rely on mass outreach and templated packages, Outset PR offers tailored PR campaigns, crafted to fit a project's market stage, goals, and budget. Backed by retrospective and real-time metrics, every campaign is tied to perfect timing , product-market fit messaging, and smart media selection. Outset’s proprietary content distribution tech helps clients dominate high-discovery surfaces. Take ChangeNOW, for example: after partnering with Outset, they achieved a sustained 40% boost in reach , amplified by a Google Discover-powered editorial campaign. Outset PR facilitates insight-driven execution. Its in-house analytics desk spots trends before they hit mainstream radar. By evaluating media outlet visibility, domain activity, and traffic sources, Outset helps clients fine-tune their strategy for high-engagement regions like the US and UK. In a time when even Bitcoin can’t escape trade policy shockwaves, Outset PR ensures your message lands where it matters most. Conclusion The road ahead remains unclear. If Trump proceeds with full-scale tariffs on August 1, we could see renewed sell pressure across risk assets—including crypto. But if negotiations yield softer terms, a relief rally may follow. What’s certain is that Bitcoin’s price is no longer driven purely by crypto-native factors. Macroeconomic policy, international trade dynamics, and media narratives now play a bigger role than ever. In this unpredictable landscape, projects that position their brand proactively—through smart storytelling, strong media targeting, and strategic timing—are far more likely to weather the storm. And with a partner like Outset PR, navigating this storm just got a whole lot easier.

2025-07-09T12:39:05,"US Dollar Index Declines Further, Could Bitcoin Be Gearing Up for a Breakout?","The United States dollar index (DXY) has been on a decline over the past four months, recording its largest plunge in years. Since such moves have historically been correlated with positive growth in risk assets, bitcoin (BTC) could be gearing up for a strong breakout. According to a report by the market analytics platform CryptoQuant, the correlation between a weak DXY and strong BTC has emerged multiple times in the past. DXY Is Still Falling With the U.S. debt hitting a new all-time high (ATH), the DXY has fallen to a historically weak level. The metric is currently trading around 6.5 points below its 200-day moving average. This marks its most significant deviation in the last 21 years. CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost said that such DXY dips , while initially alarming, tend to benefit risk assets like BTC. Such periods are mostly favorable for the primary cryptocurrency. They also signal early bull market phases and seasons of euphoria, as the market sees an influx of liquidity. This is because the dollar loses its safe-haven appeal and investors begin to turn to risk assets. “This is a well-known correlation in traditional finance. As the dollar weakens and loses its safe-haven appeal, investors reassess their portfolio allocations and shift capital toward alternative asset classes,” he stated. An Imminent Breakout for BTC? Although the market is currently in a phase where the weakness of the DXY could trigger a BTC rally, the price of the leading crypto asset is yet to react. BTC has been trading within a 10% range from $100,000 to $110,000 since the end of May. At the time of writing, the asset was worth $108,800, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Market experts have insisted that there needs to be an increase in liquidity and demand before BTC can begin and sustain a price rally. While there is still a risk of significant correction, some analysts believe the asset has a higher chance of surging. CryptoPotato reported yesterday that the bulls have structural control; hence, the underlying momentum during this consolidation phase is tilted to the bullish side. Regardless of bulls being in control, BTC still needs fresh catalysts or clearer macroeconomic signals to be able to rally to new highs.

2025-07-09T12:30:42,"Here’s What Ripple CEO Garlinghouse Is About To Tell US Senate Today","Ripple chief executive Brad Garlinghouse will ask US lawmakers to “put the country on the path to being a global blockchain and crypto leader” when he testifies this morning before the Senate Banking Committee’s hearing on “From Wall Street to Web3: Building Tomorrow’s Digital Asset Markets.” His prepared remarks, obtained in advance, frame the session as a choice between regulatory clarity that keeps innovation onshore and a continuation of regulation-by-enforcement” that drives talent abroad. What Ripple Wants Lawmakers To Hear Garlinghouse opens by reminding senators that Ripple was created “more than a decade ago with a mission: to enable the Internet of Value — a world where money moves like information does today”. He describes the XRP Ledger as “decentralized, battle-tested” infrastructure that already powers “fast, low-cost and highly scalable” cross-border payments for banks worldwide . Ripple, he notes, operates under “over 60 payment service, crypto and money-transmitter licenses” precisely because it “made the deliberate choice to work with policymakers and regulators — not around them”. The core of the testimony is an indictment of Washington’s policy vacuum. “For the last decade, the legal and regulatory uncertainty surrounding crypto has prohibited meaningful progress in the US,” Garlinghouse warns, arguing that the absence of clear rules “has been weaponized to target good actors” and is “pushing technology, jobs and tax dollars offshore , reducing regulatory oversight and putting consumers at higher risk”. He cites Ripple’s own four-year litigation with the Securities and Exchange Commission as emblematic. The 2020 SEC lawsuit , he recalls, made Ripple “the tip of the spear of this regulation-by-enforcement campaign,” yet the company ultimately prevailed: “The court ruled in our favor on everything that mattered — including finding that the token XRP is not, in and of itself, a security”. That outcome, he contends, opened the door for other US crypto firms to fight back. Garlinghouse then lays out three legislative priorities: 1) clear jurisdictional boundaries among regulators, 2) workable pathways for companies to build in the United States without sacrificing investor safeguards, and 3) a framework that lets America “be a global leader in crypto by taking full advantage of the benefits and efficiencies brought by digital assets and blockchain technologies”. With an estimated 55 million US crypto users and a $3.4 trillion global market capitalization on the line, he argues, the stakes are national—not merely corporate. “Speaking on behalf of the entire crypto industry, I urge you to prioritize the passage of market-structure legislation for digital assets through this Committee and the full Senate,” Garlinghouse tells lawmakers, predicting that such a step would “catalyze a new era of US competitiveness and unlock efficiencies in financial transactions”. He closes with a challenge: “There is no reason we should not be the undisputed leader in digital assets and blockchain”. Whether those words move the legislative needle will become clearer as the hearing unfolds, but Garlinghouse’s testimony sets the tone: cooperation over confrontation, clarity over uncertainty—and a blunt warning that the window for US leadership is narrowing fast. At press time, XRP traded at $2.31.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/what-ripple-ceo-garlinghouse-tell-us-senate-today/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","XRP|Brad Garlinghouse|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price",cryptocompare
2025-07-09T12:30:31,"Bitcoin Accumulation: H100 Group’s Bold $54M Investment Signals New Era","In a move that highlights the evolving landscape of corporate finance, a Swedish health tech firm is making waves in the crypto world. H100 Group, known for its innovations in health technology, has announced a significant funding round aimed squarely at a robust Bitcoin accumulation strategy. This decision by a company outside the traditional tech or finance sectors underscores a growing trend: mainstream industries are increasingly recognizing Bitcoin’s potential as a strategic asset. Why Are Companies Embracing Bitcoin Accumulation? For many, the idea of a health tech company diverting funds to Bitcoin might seem unconventional. However, the rationale behind Bitcoin accumulation by corporations is becoming clearer. It’s not just about speculation; it’s about strategic diversification and hedging against inflation. Companies are increasingly viewing Bitcoin as a digital store of value, akin to digital gold, capable of preserving capital in an uncertain economic climate. The move signals a proactive approach to balance sheet management, seeking alternative assets that offer potential growth and protection against currency devaluation. The Details of H100 Group Investment H100 Group has successfully raised an additional $54 million through a combination of stock and convertible bond offerings. This substantial capital injection is specifically earmarked to bolster the company’s Bitcoin holdings. The decision to use a traditional financing mechanism like convertible bonds for a crypto-centric strategy is particularly noteworthy. It indicates a growing comfort level among investors and financial institutions in supporting ventures that integrate digital assets into their core financial plans. This significant H100 Group investment demonstrates a clear commitment to their long-term Bitcoin vision, setting a precedent for other non-crypto-native companies. Key aspects of the funding: Amount: $54 million Method: Stock and convertible bond offering Purpose: To fund a strategic Bitcoin (BTC) accumulation plan Understanding the Broader Corporate Bitcoin Strategy Trend H100 Group is not an isolated case. The adoption of Bitcoin as a treasury asset has been gaining momentum, driven by pioneers like MicroStrategy, which famously holds billions in BTC. Companies are exploring corporate Bitcoin strategy for various reasons, including: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s fixed supply and decentralized nature make it an attractive hedge against inflation, especially in an era of quantitative easing. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset to the balance sheet can reduce overall portfolio risk and enhance returns. Innovation and Brand Positioning: Embracing Bitcoin can signal a forward-thinking approach, appealing to a new generation of investors and customers. Potential Upside: While volatile, Bitcoin offers significant growth potential that traditional assets might not. Here’s a look at some notable corporate Bitcoin holdings (as of various reports, numbers subject to change): Company Primary Industry Approx. BTC Held Strategy MicroStrategy Business Intelligence ~214,400 BTC Primary treasury reserve asset Tesla Automotive, Clean Energy ~9,720 BTC Treasury reserve, transaction enablement Marathon Digital Holdings Bitcoin Mining ~17,800 BTC Self-mined holdings Coinbase Cryptocurrency Exchange ~10,500 BTC Corporate treasury Hut 8 Mining Bitcoin Mining ~9,100 BTC Self-mined holdings The Impact of BTC Institutional Adoption When a health tech firm like H100 Group decides to allocate significant capital to Bitcoin, it sends a powerful message about the increasing normalization of cryptocurrencies. This development is a strong indicator of burgeoning BTC institutional adoption beyond the typical tech and finance sectors. It suggests that Bitcoin is maturing as an asset class, moving from the fringes of speculative investment to a legitimate component of corporate treasury management. This broader acceptance could pave the way for more diverse industries to explore similar strategies, further solidifying Bitcoin’s position in the global financial ecosystem. However, this path is not without its challenges: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price fluctuations remain a primary concern for traditional companies. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies poses compliance challenges. Security Risks: Managing and securing large amounts of digital assets requires specialized expertise and robust infrastructure. Public Perception: Some traditional stakeholders may view crypto investments as risky or unconventional. What This Means for Crypto Funding and Beyond The successful capital raise by H100 Group, specifically for Bitcoin acquisition, also highlights an interesting shift in crypto funding mechanisms. While many crypto projects raise capital through token sales or venture rounds, H100 Group utilized traditional equity and debt markets to fund its Bitcoin strategy. This blending of conventional finance with digital asset objectives could become a more common pathway for companies looking to enter the crypto space without directly issuing their own tokens. It provides a more familiar and regulated avenue for capital acquisition, potentially opening doors for a wider range of institutional investors. Actionable Insights for Businesses and Investors: For Businesses: Evaluate your treasury strategy. Could a small allocation to digital assets like Bitcoin offer diversification or inflation protection? Consider the long-term benefits versus short-term volatility. For Investors: Pay attention to the types of companies entering the Bitcoin space. Diversified institutional adoption can signal broader market maturity and potential long-term value. In conclusion, H100 Group’s strategic $54 million investment in Bitcoin is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a powerful statement. It signifies a new chapter where companies from diverse sectors are confidently integrating digital assets into their core financial strategies. This bold move by a health tech firm underscores the increasing institutional acceptance of Bitcoin, potentially ushering in an era where Bitcoin accumulation becomes a standard component of corporate treasury management. As more companies follow suit, the lines between traditional finance and the crypto economy will continue to blur, paving the way for unprecedented innovation and growth.

2025-07-09T12:23:35,"More than half of Russia’s 'qualified investors' now have crypto stakes","Over half of investors that Russia considers qualified enough to assign money into crypto assets have already purchased cryptocurrencies, a new survey shows. Most of those who haven’t tried it yet would like to do so in the future, according to the poll that also found that they prefer to convert Russian rubles into digital coins. 90% of qualified Russian investors attracted to crypto A sizable majority of Russian investors allowed to legally trade crypto have either acquired cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) or plan to do that. That’s according to a recent study carried out amid a growing crypto turnover in Russia. The results published by the business daily Vedomosti this week show that 52% of qualified investors in the country already have experience with cryptocurrency instruments, the crypto news outlet Bits.media reported. Another 38% of the respondents haven’t tried crypto yet, but they are willing to do so. That means that a total of 90% of those in the studied sample signal interest in decentralized digital assets in terms of investment opportunities. The survey was conducted among 1,500 men and women over the age of 20 in Russian cities with a population exceeding 100,000 people. All participants are qualified investors with financial assets of at least 50,000 rubles (approx. $600) in their possession. Russia is yet to comprehensively regulate operations with cryptocurrencies, but its main financial regulators, the Bank of Russia and the Ministry of Finance, have made it clear they do not intend to admit every Russian to the crypto market. In March, the central bank proposed to permit a limited number of investors to buy and sell digital coins under a special “experimental legal regime.” The monetary authority insisted these should only be “ highly qualified investors .” To be granted this status, private individuals would need to prove annual income of at least 50 million rubles (over $600,000) and investments in securities or deposits exceeding 100 million rubles (more than $1.2 million), although these thresholds are still to be officially approved. While the Central Bank of Russia itself is not planning to add Bitcoin to its reserves, it announced in May that qualified investors are free to buy crypto derivatives, including securities with yields tied to cryptocurrency prices, as long as these are non-deliverable. A number of Russian financial institutions have since joined the race to offer clients such products . Among them is Russia’s largest stock market, the Moscow Exchange, which recently unveiled that it will launch a crypto futures contract based on its own new Bitcoin index . Russians keep buying Bitcoin, defying restrictive rules Despite the opposition of financial authorities in Moscow against allowing ordinary Russians to purchase cryptocurrencies, a recent estimate indicated that Russian citizens have already acquired well over $25 billion worth of crypto assets. Around 60% of the respondents in the new study quoted by the Russian press expect interest in cryptocurrency-based products to increase as a result of the growing offering of such instruments from established companies. They highlight the reliability of service providers as a key factor for their decisions (43%), along with low fees (24%) and convenient deposits and withdrawals (24%), noted analysts at the Russian investment firm BCS, who compiled the report. The survey also found that the main motives for getting hold of crypto instruments include long-term investments (57% of respondents), portfolio diversification (32%), and short-term speculation (25%). The authors detail further: “Currently, 33% of investors have 5-10% of their portfolios invested in instruments related to crypto assets.” A clear majority among the polled Russian investors, 78%, prefer the services of domestic platforms registered in Russia’s jurisdiction. Most investors, 85%, also like using Russian rubles to top up their investment accounts. Insufficient knowledge about digital assets and the high volatility of cryptocurrencies have been singled out as the main barriers to investing in crypto-linked financial instruments.

Other interested and eligible subscribers of OSRT will be able to use BTC, USDT, or TAC to acquire OSRT tokens. “Our upcoming STO is not just a tokenization of our equity – it’s a foundational element of our long-term capital and treasury strategy,” said Peter Hwang , CEO of OSRH. “We believe that our combined $50 million STO plan and $80 million equity line of credit (ELOC) from White Lion GBM Innovation Fund provides a credible and achievable path towards building a $100 million Bitcoin and USDT reserve on our balance sheet.” Key Elements of the OSRT Security Token Roadmap: Plan for up to $50 Million STO Under Reg D : OSR Holdings aims to raise up to $50 million in digital assets via the OSRT token in the second half of 2025, offered under Regulation D, targeting accredited investors. Eligibility of BTC, USDT, and TAC : OSRT will be offered to accredited investors who may subscribe using BTC, USDT, or TAC, enabling diversified participation and aligning with OSRH’s existing blockchain ecosystem partnerships. Special Restrictions for BCM Europe AG : While TAC will be accepted from eligible investors in the STO, BCM Europe AG, as the issuer of TAC and a major shareholder of OSR Holdings, will not be permitted to subscribe using TAC directly. Instead, BCM Europe will convert its TAC holdings into BTC or USDT through market-based transactions, a process designed to avoid conflicts of interest and align with best practices on insider participation. ELOC-Backed Liquidity Plan : In parallel to the STO, OSR Holdings continues to draw from its $80 million ELOC from White Lion GBM Innovation Fund, further reinforcing its capital base and enabling the company to scale its crypto holdings toward a realistic $100 million reserve. Crypto-Healthcare Convergence Strategy : OSRH is integrating decentralized finance with healthcare innovation, supported by its unique ecosystem that includes TAC, which is already actively used within the global Taekwondo community. Additional announcements on TAC real-world integration with digital healthcare are planned for 3Q2025. “This roadmap represents a significant evolution in how public healthcare companies can engage with digital finance,” said Chris Bang , Chief Financial Officer of O SRH. “By structuring this offering with both transparency and accessibility in mind, we aim to reach a new generation of investors while maintaining regulatory discipline and operational integrity.” About OSR Holdings, Inc.

Major conglomerate SBI Group's APLUS is letting cardholders redeem APLUS points for small amounts of bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), or XRP (XRP). 2,100 points will earn users over 2,000 japanese yen worth of tokens, around $13 at current exchange rates. The crypto is handled by SBI’s exchange arm and deposited directly into the user’s VC Trade account. The feature is opt-in and available only for cards that qualify under the APLUS Points program. Although a relatively small amount, it marks the first time cryptocurrency has been added to APLUS’s prize catalog, which previously focused on cashbacks and partner rewards. For SBI, it’s a low-stakes way to drive user exposure without pushing speculative trading. The bank has backed Ripple for years, and XRP was the first token listed on VC Trade when it launched in 2018.

2025-07-09T12:10:27,"Hugging Face Robots: Unleashing the Future with Reachy Mini Desktop Devices","The world of artificial intelligence and robotics is constantly evolving, presenting exciting new opportunities for innovation. For those deeply entrenched in the cryptocurrency space, understanding these technological advancements is crucial, as they often intersect with decentralized systems and the future of digital economies. A significant step forward comes from Hugging Face, a leading AI development platform , which has officially opened orders for its much-anticipated Reachy Mini desktop robots . This move isn’t just about new hardware; it’s about empowering a new generation of builders and fostering an open-source future for robotics, a philosophy that resonates strongly with the decentralized ethos of crypto. Hugging Face Robots: A New Era for AI Development Hugging Face, widely recognized for its contributions to the artificial intelligence landscape, is now extending its influence into tangible hardware. The announcement marks a pivotal moment for developers eager to bridge the gap between AI models and physical interaction. Initially unveiled as prototypes in May alongside the larger humanoid robot, HopeJR, the Reachy Mini Hugging Face robots are now ready to be shipped, allowing enthusiasts and professionals alike to begin hands-on experimentation. These compact yet powerful devices are designed to be accessible and highly programmable, reflecting Hugging Face’s commitment to democratizing AI. The company is offering two distinct versions to cater to different developer needs: Reachy Mini Wireless: Priced at $449, this version offers complete freedom of movement, running on a Raspberry Pi 5 mini-computer. Its wireless capability makes it ideal for dynamic testing environments or simply moving around a workspace. Reachy Mini Lite: A more budget-friendly option at $299, this version requires a wired connection to a computing source. It’s perfect for developers who prefer a stationary setup or have existing computing resources readily available. Both models are delivered as a kit, inviting developers to engage directly with the assembly process. This hands-on approach ensures a deeper understanding of the robot’s mechanics and encourages customization from the ground up. Meet the Reachy Mini: Your New Desktop Robotics Companion The Reachy Mini is more than just a piece of hardware; it’s an interactive canvas for AI innovation. Roughly the size of a standard stuffed animal, these delightful desktop robots feature two screens for expressive eyes and two antennas, giving them a friendly and approachable demeanor. Once assembled, the true power of the Reachy Mini comes to life: full programmability in Python. This Python integration is a game-changer, as it’s one of the most popular languages for AI and robotics development, making the Reachy Mini accessible to a vast community of coders. Furthermore, each device comes with a set of pre-installed demos, allowing users to quickly get started and explore its capabilities. A core advantage is its seamless integration with the Hugging Face Hub, the company’s vast open-source machine learning platform. This integration grants users immediate access to an incredible repository of over 1.7 million AI models and more than 400,000 datasets, providing an unparalleled resource for building sophisticated applications. The Power of Open-Source Robotics: Why It Matters Hugging Face CEO, Clém Delangue, shared insights with Bitcoin World, revealing that the decision to launch two versions of the Reachy Mini was directly influenced by initial user feedback on their original prototype. Delangue recounted a poignant anecdote about an early tester whose five-year-old daughter wanted to carry the desktop robot around the house. This feedback highlighted a clear demand for portability and user-centric design. “The goal in the future is to keep carefully getting a lot of feedback like that from users, from the community, that’s how we’ve always been building products at Hugging Face as an open source community platform,” Delangue stated. This philosophy underpins the entire project. The inherent nature of the open-source robotics design means that “people will be able to extend it, modify it, change everything they want.” This collaborative approach fosters rapid innovation and ensures the technology evolves in line with community needs and desires, much like the collaborative development seen in many blockchain projects. Empowering AI Developers: Building the Future Together Delangue emphasized that the primary target audience for these devices is dedicated AI developers . The Reachy Minis provide a unique sandbox for coding, building, and rigorously testing AI applications in a physical environment. This hands-on experience is invaluable for understanding the nuances of real-world robotics. “Anyone will be able to build their own specific features and apps for Reachy Mini that then they’ll be able to share with the community,” Delangue explained. This vision extends beyond individual projects; it aims to cultivate a vibrant ecosystem where creativity flourishes. “So we hope that it’s really going to unleash the creativity of builders to build, you know, millions of different applications, millions of different features that they can share with the community, so that anyone can then, like, plug and play with it.” This emphasis on community-driven development and shareable applications mirrors the collaborative spirit often found in open-source blockchain initiatives, where shared codebases drive collective progress. Availability and the Vision Ahead Developers won’t have to wait long to get their hands on these innovative robots. The Reachy Mini Lite is slated to begin shipping next month, with the wireless version following later this year. Delangue highlighted the importance of a swift shipping process, opting against lengthy pre-order timelines to ensure the robots reach users as quickly as possible. This commitment to rapid deployment reflects a desire to accelerate development and feedback cycles within the community. This release aligns perfectly with Hugging Face’s broader vision for its robotics program: to champion open-source hardware that grants users complete control. “I feel like it’s really important for the future of robotics to be open source, instead of being closed source, black box, [and] concentrated in the hands of a few companies,” Delangue asserted. He articulated a compelling argument for decentralized control in robotics, drawing parallels to concerns about centralized power in other technological domains. “I think it’s quite a scary world to have like millions of robots in people’s home controlled by one company, with customers, users, not really being able to control them, understand them. I would much rather live in a place, or in a world, or in a country, where everyone can have some control over the robots.” This strong advocacy for user autonomy and transparency resonates deeply with the core principles of decentralization championed by the cryptocurrency community. A Glimpse into an Open Future The launch of the Hugging Face Reachy Mini desktop robots is more than just a product release; it’s a statement about the future of AI and robotics. By embracing an open-source, community-driven approach, Hugging Face is not only making advanced robotics more accessible but also fostering an environment where innovation can truly thrive. For AI developers , this means unprecedented opportunities to experiment, build, and share, contributing to a collective intelligence that will shape the next generation of intelligent machines. The emphasis on user control and transparency echoes the very foundations of decentralized technologies, suggesting a harmonious path forward where powerful AI tools are democratized, not monopolized.

2025-07-09T12:00:25,"Bitcoin Acquisition: LQwD Unleashes $9M Private Placement for Explosive Crypto Growth","In the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, strategic moves by innovative companies often signal significant shifts. One such development comes from LQWD Technologies Corp., a Canadian firm at the forefront of Bitcoin Lightning infrastructure. They’ve just announced a substantial upsizing of their private placement, securing a remarkable C$12.3 million (approximately $9 million USD). This isn’t just about raising capital; it’s a bold statement, primarily earmarked for a strategic Bitcoin acquisition and strengthening their position in the digital asset space. This move highlights a growing trend of companies embracing digital assets not just for operational purposes, but as a core treasury strategy. What does this mean for the future of Bitcoin, the Lightning Network, and the broader crypto market? What is This Landmark LQwD Technologies Investment? LQWD Technologies Corp., known for its pioneering work in developing and operating infrastructure for the Bitcoin Lightning Network, has successfully expanded its previously announced funding initiative. Initially, the company aimed for a smaller raise, but strong investor interest allowed them to significantly increase the offering. According to a press release distributed via GlobeNewswire, the total amount secured through both brokered and non-brokered private placements now stands at an impressive C$12.3 million, translating to roughly $9 million USD. This substantial capital injection serves a dual purpose. The primary allocation of the net proceeds is designated for the acquisition of Bitcoin. This decision reflects a strategic financial approach, leveraging Bitcoin as a core treasury asset, which many forward-thinking companies are now considering. Beyond Bitcoin holdings, a portion of the funds will also be directed towards general corporate purposes, ensuring LQwD has the necessary liquidity to continue its operational growth, research, and development efforts in the burgeoning crypto sector. This significant financial boost positions LQwD Technologies to further solidify its leadership in the Bitcoin Lightning space, providing crucial infrastructure that enhances Bitcoin’s scalability and utility. Why a Strategic Bitcoin Acquisition Now? The decision by LQwD Technologies to allocate a significant portion of its newly raised capital towards a direct Bitcoin acquisition is a compelling one, reflecting a broader trend of corporate adoption of digital assets. Why now, and what are the underlying strategic reasons for this move? Treasury Management: For many companies, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a robust alternative to traditional fiat currencies for treasury reserves. Its decentralized nature and fixed supply offer a hedge against inflation and currency debasement, making it an attractive long-term store of value. Alignment with Core Business: As a company deeply embedded in the Bitcoin ecosystem through its Lightning Network infrastructure, holding Bitcoin directly aligns with LQwD’s core mission and operational model. It demonstrates confidence in the asset they facilitate transactions for. Market Opportunity: Companies often time their Bitcoin acquisitions based on market conditions. While the crypto market can be volatile, strategic purchases during opportune moments can yield significant long-term returns, strengthening the company’s balance sheet. Enhanced Credibility: By holding Bitcoin, LQwD reinforces its commitment and belief in the future of Bitcoin and its underlying technology. This can enhance investor confidence and market perception, signaling a deep conviction in the digital economy. This strategic move goes beyond simply accumulating an asset; it’s about integrating Bitcoin into the very fabric of the company’s financial strategy, underscoring its belief in the asset’s enduring value and its role in the future of finance. How Does This Fuel the Lightning Network’s Potential? LQwD Technologies’ core business revolves around the Lightning Network , a second-layer payment protocol built on top of Bitcoin. This network aims to solve Bitcoin’s scalability issues by enabling faster, cheaper, and more frequent transactions. So, how does this substantial funding, particularly the Bitcoin acquisition, directly impact and fuel the Lightning Network’s potential? The Lightning Network relies on channels funded by Bitcoin. Companies like LQwD operate these nodes and channels, routing payments across the network. By acquiring more Bitcoin, LQwD can: Increase Channel Capacity: More Bitcoin means LQwD can open larger and more robust payment channels on the Lightning Network. This increases the total capacity of the network, allowing for larger individual transactions and more efficient routing. Enhance Network Liquidity: With greater Bitcoin holdings, LQwD can provide better liquidity across its nodes, ensuring that payments can be routed quickly and reliably without delays due to insufficient channel balances. This improves the overall user experience and reliability of Lightning payments. Strengthen Network Stability: A well-capitalized node operator with significant Bitcoin reserves contributes to the stability and decentralization of the Lightning Network. It reduces reliance on a few large entities and makes the network more resilient. Support Future Development: While a portion of funds is for Bitcoin, the general corporate purposes allocation directly supports the technical development and expansion of LQwD’s Lightning Network infrastructure. This includes improving node software, enhancing security, and exploring new features. Ultimately, this investment isn’t just about holding Bitcoin; it’s about empowering the infrastructure that makes Bitcoin more usable for everyday transactions, paving the way for a more scalable and efficient digital economy powered by the Lightning Network . Understanding the Private Placement Mechanism: What Does It Entail? The funding secured by LQwD Technologies comes in the form of an upsized private placement . But what exactly does a private placement mean, and how does it differ from other fundraising methods? A private placement is a direct offering of securities (like shares or convertible notes) to a select group of investors, rather than through a public offering on a stock exchange. This method is often chosen for several reasons: Speed and Efficiency: Private placements can be executed much faster than public offerings, as they involve fewer regulatory hurdles and less extensive documentation. Targeted Investors: Companies can handpick investors who understand their business model, vision, and long-term potential, often institutional investors, high-net-worth individuals, or strategic partners. Cost-Effectiveness: While fees are still involved, the overall costs associated with a private placement can be lower than a full-blown initial public offering (IPO) or secondary public offering. LQwD’s placement included both brokered and non-brokered components. A brokered private placement involves an investment bank or broker-dealer acting as an intermediary to find investors, while a non-brokered placement is conducted directly by the company without an intermediary. The upsizing from an initially planned smaller amount to C$12.3 million indicates strong investor confidence in LQwD’s strategy and the future of Bitcoin Lightning infrastructure. Here’s a simplified comparison of the private placement’s scale: Aspect Original Placement Size (Approx.) Upsized Private Placement (Approx.) Total Capital Raised C$7.5 million ($5.5 million USD) C$12.3 million ($9 million USD) Primary Use of Funds Bitcoin Acquisition, General Corporate Purposes Bitcoin Acquisition, General Corporate Purposes Investor Confidence Indication Moderate Strong This successful private placement underscores the market’s growing appetite for exposure to Bitcoin and the infrastructure supporting its evolution. Broader Implications for Crypto Investment and Corporate Strategy LQwD Technologies’ strategic move to acquire a significant amount of Bitcoin through an upsized private placement carries broader implications for the entire landscape of crypto investment and corporate strategy. This isn’t an isolated incident; it’s part of a burgeoning trend that reflects increasing institutional confidence in digital assets. What does this mean for the wider market? Validation of Bitcoin as a Treasury Asset: More companies are following the lead of pioneers like MicroStrategy, treating Bitcoin as a legitimate treasury reserve asset. This trend could accelerate as regulatory clarity improves and more traditional financial institutions offer crypto-related services. Growth in Bitcoin Infrastructure: Investments like LQwD’s directly support the underlying infrastructure that makes Bitcoin more usable. As the Lightning Network expands and becomes more robust, it enhances Bitcoin’s utility as a medium of exchange, not just a store of value. This makes Bitcoin a more attractive investment for both individuals and institutions. Increased Institutional Participation: The success of LQwD’s private placement indicates that institutional investors are actively seeking opportunities to gain exposure to the crypto space, particularly through companies building essential infrastructure. This influx of sophisticated capital can bring stability and maturity to the market. Precedent for Other Fintechs: LQwD’s approach could serve as a blueprint for other fintech firms looking to integrate digital assets more deeply into their business models and financial strategies. It showcases a viable path for leveraging private capital to pursue crypto-centric growth. Actionable Insights for Investors: For those observing the crypto market, LQwD’s move offers several insights: Look Beyond Spot Prices: While Bitcoin’s price movements are captivating, understanding the underlying infrastructure development (like the Lightning Network) and corporate adoption strategies provides a more holistic view of the market’s long-term health. Identify Enabling Technologies: Companies that build essential services and infrastructure for the crypto economy, like LQwD, can offer compelling investment opportunities as the sector matures. Monitor Corporate Treasury Trends: Keep an eye on public and private companies announcing Bitcoin acquisitions or crypto-related treasury strategies. These announcements can signal growing mainstream acceptance and potentially influence market dynamics. While the benefits are clear, it’s also important to acknowledge potential challenges. The crypto market remains volatile, and regulatory landscapes are still evolving. Companies undertaking such strategies must navigate these risks carefully. However, LQwD’s successful crypto investment and funding round signal a strong conviction in the long-term potential of Bitcoin and its supporting technologies. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards a Bitcoin-Powered Future LQwD Technologies’ successful upsizing of its private placement to $9 million, primarily for a strategic Bitcoin acquisition, marks a pivotal moment for the company and a significant indicator for the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. This move not only fortifies LQwD’s balance sheet with a robust digital asset but also underscores its unwavering commitment to building and scaling the vital Bitcoin Lightning Network infrastructure. It reflects a growing trend of corporate confidence in Bitcoin as a fundamental asset and a strategic component of future-proof business models. By investing directly in Bitcoin and simultaneously enhancing its operational capacity, LQwD is positioning itself at the vanguard of the digital economy. This development signals that the integration of digital assets into mainstream corporate finance is not just a passing fad but a strategic imperative for innovation and growth. As companies like LQwD continue to push the boundaries, the vision of a more efficient, decentralized, and Bitcoin-powered financial future moves ever closer to reality.

2025-07-09T12:00:18,"Despite 2 Scary Words - Bitcoin And Diversification, I'm A Riot Platforms Fan","Summary Riot Platforms is a challenging stock. It involves two words that should scare off the fainthearted… (1) bitcoin and (2) diversification. For many, the word “bitcoin” is an automatic red flag… gambling, etc. But actually, it and crypto are gaining respectability and even functionality (as real money). RIOT is a big-time miner. The number of possible new coins is capped. We won’t reach the end till about 2140, but growth will decelerate as we progress toward then. So, it makes sense for RIOT to diversify. Like other miners, it’s eyeing the data center business, a power-hungry cousin to mining. Success here won’t be automatic for anybody. But…. I think RIOT will succeed. It has a lot of good land near Dallas, an important Tier 1 data center region. This contributes to my story-oriented “Buy” rating. Remember when… Remember when Amazon.com, Inc. ( AMZN ) sold books online? The company still does that, but it’s better known for other things today (selling countless different things, cloud). Remember when Microsoft Corporation ( MSFT ) was about operating systems? The company still does that, but it’s better known for other things today (cloud, application software). Remember when MicroStrategy sold enterprise analytics software? The company still does that, but with a new name, MicroStrategy Incorporated ( MSTR ), it’s now better known for other things (bitcoin Treasury holdings). Remember when Riot Blockchain was about Bitcoin mining? It still is and has lately been getting better at it, but the company rebranded in 2023 as Riot Platforms, Inc. (RIOT). That reflects its wish to diversify. RIOT can be uncomfortable for investors. It involves two words many find scary… I suggested one of them above… diversification. This sounds respectable, even essential, on its face. Investors constantly hear this when it comes to asset allocation. It can also serve companies well… so long as it’s done wisely. But many companies do it badly. As investment legend Peter Lynch says, one should guard against “ diworsification .” Rather than generating shareholder wealth, they instead make things worse… and generate accounting write-offs. Diversification might sound less challenging if we could at least understand and relax about RIOT’s core competency. But its established business confronts us with the other scary word. One, of course, is bitcoin. Many swear by it as the wave of the future in finance, as a store of value and as a better alternative to conventional money. Many others scorn it as nonsense or gambling. An investment case for or against RIOT stock should be based on how one evaluates it in terms of the two challenging words, diversification and bitcoin. Let’s start looking more closely at the latter… My Stance Toward Bitcoin Has Evolved and is Now Much More Positive Than It Was a Year or So Ago It took me a long time before I came around on bitcoin, and crypto in general. Like many, I thought it was nonsense at worst and at best, gambling without cool casinos, fun shows, and countless restaurants. Too, it can be easy (and self-gratifying) to see market participants as an ignorant or dysfunctional herd. Folks like Ben Graham and Warren Buffet helped to legitimize that view with the Mr. Market allegory . But as I accumulate years of experience analyzing investments (since late 1979), I’ve learned more and more about how important it is to respect the market. Information has become increasingly plentiful. And different views are more likely to reflect different investment goals and risk preferences. True stupidity is quite rare. That helped me see Bitcoin less as folly and more like a collectible… a digital collectible. How much different, once we adapt to the now-ubiquitous digital world, is a bitcoin than a gold bar or a baseball card picturing a great 1950s-era player. (See generally here ). Of course, some things are more collectible than other things. The bursting of the 1600s Dutch tulipmania proved that. As it turned out, the more I learned about the potentially functional properties of crypto and blockchain , the less necessary it became to delve deeper into the philosophy of collectibles. RIOT holds some bitcoin in Treasury (19,223 coins, amounting to about $5 per diluted RIOT share at bitcoin’s recent price of about $108,000). But unlike MSTR, it doesn’t necessarily hold permanently. RIOT has recently shown itself to be willing to use its bitcoin to help it raise capital for other things. (See below). And operationally… RIOT is One of the Major Domestic Bitcoin Miners Bitcoin mining is something of a brain scrambler. That’s so even for those who’ve learned to accept crypto as a legitimate asset. It’s a complex process. But it’s also quite interesting. (I explain more, in regular people language, in my 5/27/25 MARA report ). Here are the key aspects of mining you need to know to assess the investment merits of RIOT: Miners get newly issued coins by successfully answering an absurdly complex mathematical puzzle. Success requires a monstrous amount of computing trial and error. This is very electricity intensive. So, mining profitability isn’t only about bitcoin prices. It’s also about controlling power costs and mining equipment energy efficiency. Each trial is called a hash. Mining power is expressed as “hashrate” (number of trial answers per second). More trials and higher hashrates increase the likelihood of success. The number of possible bitcoins is capped at 21 million. To postpone the end date as far as possible, the number of coins awarded per successful hash is periodically cut in half. As miners go, RIOT is quite good. Scale alone helps RIOT manage power costs. But its primary Texas location may be a much bigger plus. The deregulated power market there opens up opportunities for creativity. A big thing for RIOT is its power curtailment strategy . Based on this, RIOT shuts mining operations during local periods of peak electricity demand. It especially times this in relation to the June through September Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) Four Coincident Peak (4CP) periods. But it doesn’t just stop trying to get Bitcoin. RIOT also sells power back to the grid during high-demand intervals. With electricity prices spiking at such times, RIOT does well, perhaps even better than it could by mining, on these occasions. According to CFO Colin Yee on the 5/1/25 earnings call : Direct cost of mine, excluding depreciation, in the first quarter of 2025 was $43,808 per Bitcoin, of which power costs amounted to $35,313 per Bitcoin or 81% of total direct cost per Bitcoin. Quarter-over-quarter, our net power costs decreased from $0.038 a kilowatt hour to $0.034 a kilowatt hour as Riot's power strategy continued to yield strong results. Another plus is RIOT’s dual cooling approach . It optimizes as appropriate between immersion and air-cooled systems. That’s another way to control power costs. Also, RIOT has a small Energy/Infrastructure operation. It contributes little in the way of revenues and profits. But it helps make RIOT vertically integrated . That means it gives the company more than usual control over its mining hardware supply chain. The unit makes equipment specifically geared for RIOT’s needs. Meanwhile, RIOT has dramatically increased its hashrate over the past year. RIOT IR The company has, lately, spent heavily to buy cutting-edge mining equipment. An acquisition of sorts (a deal involving Corsicana – see below) added to RIOT’s already-large scale. So bitcoin mining, the company’s dominant current business, is on a roll. Analyst Compilation and Calculations based on data from pages F47 - F48 of latest 10-K and pages 31-32 of latest 10-Q Analyst Compilation and Calculations based on data from pages F47 - F48 of latest 10-K and pages 31-32 of latest 10-Q Analyst Compilation and Calculations based on data from pages F47 - F48 of latest 10-K and pages 31-32 of latest 10-Q But let’s remember… As Great as Things Now Look for RIOT Mining, This Business Has a Ceiling RIOT’s forward hashrate expectations do not look especially buoyant. RIOT IR It could probably work harder to mine better… if it wished to. And as the slide notes, a recent acquisition (Rhodium) allows for some guidance upside (more below). Ultimately, though, the company strategically decided to refrain from adding much to mining capital spending. In fact, its latest 38.4 EH/s hashrate forecast is the result of management’s downward revision. It previously forecast 46.7 EH/s . (NOTE: EH/s means exahashes per second, or one quintillion hashes per second. A quintillion is one followed by 18 zeroes!) This relates to the last of the prior section’s bullet points. It bears repeating. The number of possible bitcoins is capped at 21 million. To postpone the end date as far as possible, the number of coins awarded per successful hash is periodically cut in half. Don’t panic… Mining isn’t likely to max out until about 2140 . But halving events (periodic reductions in the number of coins awarded for successful hashes) will continue to make this a progressively harder and probably less lucrative business. That seems opposed to what growth investors want. (Value investors don’t even get there… They’re likely stuck on the word “bitcoin.”) Rest assured RIOT management does NOT have its head in the sand about this. As noted above, it’s diversifying. To support this, RIOT is shifting resources and attention away from trying to max out on mining. That said… Diversification is not inevitable. The company could simply live with the halvings. Investors in natural resource royalty trusts and target date ETFs or mutual funds do something like that. (They face liquidation targets). So, too, could Bitcoin mining shareholders adjust (assuming they appropriately study up and really learn what’s going on). Combined with the RIOT’s owning bitcoin and serving as an asset play, this could work. So, RIOT can’t just diversify and insist all will be well. It also needs to diversify sensibly and well . Diversification must be better than alternative solutions. Diworsification won’t do! That’s why I referred above to diversification as one of the scary RIOT words. But there’s good news… RIOT’s Planned Move into Data Centers Stands an Excellent Chance of Success Demand for Data Centers in General Anybody with any interest in AI, HPC (High Performance Computing), etc. had to wonder about this earlier this year. Who among us could forget DeepSeek Apocalypse ( so named by me ). That happened when Hangzhou DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence Co., Ltd. ( DEEPSEEK ) announced it created a great AI model that cost much less than popular models then in use. AI-related stocks tanked. So, too, did those that relate to data centers. Investors assumed we were overspending. Many observers and investors feared cutbacks and lower data center demand. But eventually, analytic heads with boots-on-the-ground vantage points prevailed. And once-beaten-down stocks rebounded. On the 6/12/25 Oracle Corporation ( ORCL ) earnings call , Larry Ellison, that company’s Co-Founder, Chairman and CTO, was quite definitive: Let me add, we recently got an order that said we'll take all the capacity you have wherever it is. It could be in Europe, it could be in Asia. We'll just take everything. I mean we never got an order like that before. We had to move things around. We did the best we could to give them the capacity they needed. The demand is astronomical… [D]emand right now seems almost insatiable. I mean I don't know how to describe it. I've never seen anything remotely like this. I mean people are calling up and asking us, please, can you find us more capacity. We'll take it wherever. It's in Malaysia, we'll take it fine. We'll take it there. We got some wherever. EMCOR Group, Inc. ( EME ) management shared similar views. See my 6/20/25 EME report for more. RIOT agrees with this assessment. RIOT IR CEO Jason Les verbalized it thusly on the 5/1/25 earnings call : [W]e continue to be very encouraged by the feedback that we've received not just from hyperscalers but potential financing partners, which will be critical in this development as well. And everyone continues to recognize the value of power that can be delivered in the near term. In this case, we're talking about 2026. The fact remains. There's approximately 5 gigawatts of data center capacity being used for generative AI today, and the forecast is we're going to need about 30 gigawatts by 2030. So that's a pretty big delta to fill in a pretty short period of time. And as a result, we continue to see strong demand. Bottom line: Demand for data centers isn’t shrinking. It’s soaring. Nobody should quibble with this as a chosen field for RIOT’s diversification efforts. Of course, that alone won’t support an investment case for RIOT. We need to go further. We can’t naively assume every data center venture will succeed. Introducing the Data Center Business… plus Location Location and Location In general, if you hear of a Bitcoin miner aspiring to data center work, start with a presumption of innocence. Bitcoin mining has a voracious appetite for power. Ditto modern AI- and HPC-oriented data centers. So, they’re compatible bedfellows. Focusing on AI, today’s main headline grabber, data needs vary. If you’re thinking about model training, think big… or rather HUGE! This is where we expose models to monstrous amounts of information. Using that data, the models learn how to recognize patterns, spit back old information, and answer new questions. Think of training as a university where AI models studied. (And as in human universities, there’s continuing education. New information/data is always being generated. So models need to keep updating their training. In human terms, we refer to this as lifelong learning ). Then, there’s inference. This is where graduates go out into the world, get jobs, and do regular work. This is about inference. It’s what you’re doing if you use ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, etc. It’s what Seeking Alpha does when it creates AI stock reports or Earnings Call Insights. Training tasks are monumental, but not necessarily frequent. Inference tasks tend to be smaller (by AI standards, which is still huge compared to non-AI tasks). But they’re frequent. Some data centers are huge. Others are smaller. Either way, we still need heretofore unimaginable amounts of power. Expect RIOT to work with larger centers. It’ll likely serve hyperscalers. (That term refers to the giants like Azure or Google Cloud). Geography plays a big role in that choice. Some parts of the country are better than others for big data centers. Electricity regulatory climates play a big role here. So, too, do access to good power sources and well-educated workforces. (See generally, here and here ). Number one is the Data Center Alley. That’s a nickname for a large northern Virginia concentration of data centers. RIOT is not there. But RIOT is right near Dallas Texas. That’s one of the Tier 1 U.S. data center markets. RIOT IR Dallas ranks number two , right behind Virginia. (See also, here ). Pivoting to Take Advantage of Its Texas-Sized Data Center Opportunity In 2022, RIOT bought a large land parcel, known as Corsicana, in Navarro County, Texas. It planned to create “ the world’s largest Bitcoin mining facility .” In May 2025, RIOT bought adjoining parcels. It thus more than doubled its Corsicana footprint. The latter … is part of Riot's plan to build large-scale data centers tailored for enterprise and hyperscale clients. CEO Jason Les emphasized that these data centers require significantly larger footprints than traditional mining operations, underscoring the company's ambition to diversify its revenue streams. To lead this initiative, Riot hired industry veteran Jonathan Gibbs as Chief Data Center Officer, signaling its commitment to expanding into the fast-growing market for AI-ready infrastructure. Here’s a visual presentation of the outcome of the land transactions. RIOT IR Les expects to serve big-league data center tenants at Corsicana: There are a number of hyperscalers and even large companies beyond hyperscalers that are in high need of power data center capacity to meet their growth targets. So I would say, especially because of the location of our site that allows it to be used for generative AI training, inference or cloud applications being 60 miles away from Dallas, a Tier 1 data center, there's a lot of different things you can do at that site. So our view is the whole hyperscaler landscape and beyond that are potential tenants in this -- for the Corsicana facility. As far as feedback, feedback from our advisers has matched really what we've gotten from tenants. And that's why we've been working on improving the land, adding water and additional fiber connectivity. These weren't things that were holding us back, but we've gotten feedback on what we can do to make the offering more compelling and put ourselves in the best position possible to be successful. As great as all this sounds, let’s maintain perspective… This is a development situation. It’s not a here-and-now money-geyser for RIOT. Even in Texas, as business-friendly as it is, it takes time to get something like this off the ground. Here are the results of the study RIOT conducted to assess what it can do with Corsicana. RIOT IR And here’s a sense of RIOT’s path forward in data centers. RIOT IR RIOT IR So as intriguing as RIOT seems, let’s now switch gears. We need to discuss topics that’ll help keep us away from the dreaded irrational exuberance… Numbers (To the Extent We Have Any Worth Examining) If you love numbers, you’ll hate RIOT. This is not a pre-revenue development entity. But neither is it an old-timer. It didn’t really get going, commerce-wise, until after the pandemic. Besides the small commercial sample, two more things make RIOT hard to quantitatively analyze. 1. Accounting for Bitcoin Operations Traditionally, companies had to write the value of bitcoin holding to account for any paper losses. OKI. Prices fall. Holdings lose value. I get it. But they were not allowed to write those values back up when Bitcoin prices recovered! Seriously! Finally, in late 2023, the accounting powers that be recognized how silly that was. So, they changed the rule to allow companies to write assets back up when appropriate. (It took effect in late 2024). Nice! Who could argue with more economic reality. But it still leaves workaday stock analysts in a quandary. Now we have two-way quarter-to-quarter profit fluctuations as bitcoin zigs and zags. Accounting standards setters pose no solutions for this volatility. I can’t think of anything either. So, it looks like we’ll just have to grit our collective teeth and cope. 2. RIOT’s Strategic Spending and Strategic Pivot Recall that Corsicana first became a gleam in RIOT’s corporate eye in 2022. It started out planning to seriously expand mining capabilities. Translation: big spending. And, of course, there’s the pivot to data centers. Translation: More spending. Numbers We Can Look At Given the above discussion, here are the only numbers I feel able to show you with a straight face. Analyst Compilation based on Data from Seeking Alpha Financial Presentations Notice the footnote below the table! You won’t be able to reconcile the operating margin I show with RIOT’s SEC documents. Nor will they match the income statement numbers Seeking Alpha presents based on what it gets from its data vendor. I did my own things there. I eliminated non-recurring items, especially the bitcoin valuation write-downs and write-ups. My solution is not perfect. I can’t eliminate bouncy numbers from ongoing Bitcoin transactions. (Even “Cash from Operations” is impacted). Let’s just say I’m doing the best I can. I think the best information you can extract from that table lies in the Cash etc. line and, in sections relating to Cash From Investing and Cash from Financing. You see the numerical equivalents to matters discussed above, mainly the expansion of mining and the pivot toward data centers. You also see that RIOT needs outside capital to keep going. That’s also so for many of today’s emerging companies. Risk Needless to say, the risk here is high. Conservative investors, look but don’t touch. Even risk-tolerant folks should size positions appropriately (i.e., small) relative to their total portfolio. Any in-development venture is necessarily risky. Will it succeed? I explained why I think RIOT will succeed. But until that actually happens, it’s a source of risk. Further… Dependence on infusions of outside capital is always risky. But the markets will likely oblige and give RIOT what it requires so long as its strategy and progress remain credible. (That’s how it is usually in situations like this. See, e.g., the financial strength discussion in my 5/21/24 CVNA writeup ). Helping, too, is RIOT’s willingness to get creative using its Bitcoin in terms of capital strategy. As Jason Chung, Head of Corporate Development and Strategy explained on the 5/1/25 earnings call (Note: ATM means at-the-market equity issuance): I think our financing activities this quarter could give a good sense of how we're thinking about all the different financing options that we have available to us. So we saw extremely limited use of the ATM, and therefore, very minimal dilution to our shareholders. When we did issue into the ATM, we achieved an average share price of $13.05 per share. So we feel pretty good about our timing when we did utilize the ATM on a limited basis. But in addition to that, we took two other steps, right? In April, we started selling our monthly Bitcoin production as well, raising additional funds that way. And now with the Coinbase facility, we've opened up another avenue of financing for us that, again, side steps the ATM. What to do About RIOT Stock Don’t even think in terms of valuation ratios. There are none here that are meaningful. Here’s the price chart. StockCharts.com There’s most recently been a lot of very positive sentiment toward RIOT. We see that in the way the 10-day exponential moving average ((EMA)) has been above and running away from the also strong 50-day EMA. We also see it in Chaikin Money Flow ((CMF)) and the Chaikin Oscillator (CO). Both measure which party to trade is more motivated. CMF does it for institutional investors. CO does it for the market in general. Both indicators have been very strong. Buyers being more motivated than sellers typically exerts upward pressure on stock prices. But trees don’t grow unabated to the sky. We have to expect a near-term breather. (We’ve seen big ups and downs before. We already see an indication of price fatigue in the very latest price bar next to the right-side edge.) All in all, nothing I see in the chart runs counter to my judgment regarding this stock. And in terms of that judgment… This is one of many emerging growth stocks today for which no meaningful valuation numbers can be calculated. It’s about the story. But it can’t be any story. It has to be a good story. And it has to be a credible story. My favorite example is value-guru William Miller’s very early investment into Amazon.com, Inc. ((AMZN)) almost on day one. I’ve described other examples on 1/12/25 with RGTI, and on 6/10/25 with QS. I see RIOT as one among that group. When it comes to rating stocks, I think in terms of probable future stock performance relative to the market, rather than literally buying, holding, or selling. And since I’m not rating based on a quant model, I’ll eschew “Strong…” extremes. Absent an exceptional degree of conviction, I think “Buy,” Hold,” or “Sell” are enough. I see RIOT as likely outperforming the broader 3- to 5-year market. I base this on the favorable stance I adopted lately towards crypto and bitcoin, and on my belief RIOT will succeed in its diversification plan. I translate that to the Seeking Alpha rating taxonomy by rating RIOT as a “Buy.”",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4800098-despite-2-scary-words-bitcoin-diversification-im-riot-platforms-fan?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|MARKET|TRADING","RIOT",cryptocompare
2025-07-09T12:00:11,"XRP Makes Trump’s Unspoken Crypto Top 5—What You Need To Know","Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) quietly lodged an S-1 with the US Securities and Exchange Commission late on July 8, seeking approval for the “Truth Social Crypto Blue Chip ETF.” Despite a swirl of social-media posts placing the paperwork in early June, the SEC’s time-stamp confirms the filing date as July 8. The prospectus sketches a five-coin portfolio weighted approximately 70 percent to bitcoin, 15 percent to ether, 8 percent to solana, 5 percent to Cronos and 2 percent to XRP, making it the first Trump-branded product to diversify beyond the two largest digital assets. The trust, structured as a Nevada business trust and sponsored by boutique issuer Yorkville America Digital, aims to list its shares on NYSE Arca. Foris DAX Trust — the US institutional arm of Crypto.com — is named digital-asset custodian, while authorized participants will create and redeem blocks of 10,000 shares in kind or for cash, subject to NYSE rule changes. The prospectus also discloses that staking rewards on ether, solana and cronos may be passed through to the fund, a design choice that would set a precedent among US spot-crypto ETFs. Related Reading: Pundit Explains Why XRP Stands To Gain Big From Ripple’s RLUSD Analyst Eric Balchunas of Bloomberg distilled the filing in two succinct posts on X: “New filing for the Truth Social Crypto Blue Chip ETF, which will be a spot crypto basket holding Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, XRP and Cronos,” he wrote; in a follow-up, he reproduced the pivotal language: “the Trust’s allocation… is initially expected to approximate 70% bitcoin, 15% ether, 8% SOL, 5% CRO and 2% XRP.” Those percentages now serve as the market’s working model for how the Trump universe ranks crypto’s ‘blue chips.’ Why Solana, Cronos And XRP? Overall, the allocation may serve as an implicit ranking of the top five crypto assets as viewed through the lens of Trump’s inner circle. Binance top trader by PnL Nachi (@alphawifhat) commented via X: “I think it’s useful to look at the allocation ratio of the Truth Social Crypto ETF I see this as an indication of how Trump’s crypto team looks at the top crypto assets and what are the top 5 they want to value the most. This could be a catalyst to pump CRO as it’s a dark horse.” Solana’s climb to an 8 percent weight is more than a momentum trade. CME Group this spring announced cash-settled Solana futures pending CFTC sign-off, extending the same institutional rails that helped bitcoin and ether graduate into ETF form. Notably, the SEC has set a July deadline for spot Solana ETF refilings, indicating a potential approval before the October 2 deadline. Related Reading: XRP Set To Shock The Crypto Market With 30% Share, Analyst Predicts Cronos leaps over better-capitalized tokens because Crypto.com is literally powering Trump’s ETFs. “We are proud to partner with Trump Media and Yorkville… including the first-of-its-kind basket of tokens featuring CRO,” Crypto.com co-founder Kris Marszalek said in March when the multi-year, roughly $2.7 billion partnership was unveiled. Under the agreement, Crypto.com supplies custody, liquidity and back-end order routing for all Truth-branded funds. XRP brings up the rear at two percent, reflecting both its renewed legitimacy and its still-nascent institutional plumbing. On June 27, Ripple Labs announced that it will withdraw its cross appeal against the SEC. The token’s modest two-percent slice is politicized as much as it is financial. In early March a staffer from Ballard Partners—the K-Street shop that counts Ripple as a client—slipped Donald Trump draft language for a Truth Social post urging that XRP, Solana and Cardano be placed in a national “Crypto Strategic Reserve.” Trump hit “post” and only later discovered the Ripple connection; insiders told Politico he “was furious and felt like he’d been used.” Despite that, the inclusion of XRP still shows Trump’s ties with Ripple. At press time, XRP traded at $2.33.
