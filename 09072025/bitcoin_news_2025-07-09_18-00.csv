2025-07-09T15:46:26,"Trump-Linked Truth Social Files With SEC For ‘Crypto Blue Chip’ ETF Tracking Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, And Solana","U.S. President Donald Trump’s Media & Technology Group has submitted an S-1 registration statement to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to offer an exchange-traded fund tracking the prices of a basket of top crypto assets, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple’s XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cronos. The preliminary prospectus stated the Truth Social Crypto Blue Chip ETF will consist of 70% BTC, 15% ETH, 8% SOL, 5% CRO, and 2% XRP. “The Trust is a passive investment vehicle that seeks to reflect generally the performance of the prices of the Portfolio Assets before payment of the Trust’s expenses and liabilities,” the filing reads. The investment vehicle is being launched in collaboration with Yorkville America Digital, the same asset manager backing Trump Media’s previous applications for a dual Bitcoin and Ether ETF , as well as a standalone BTC fund . Crypto.com’s custody affiliate, Foris DAX Trust Company, will act as the fund’s custodian, responsible for safekeeping the underlying assets. Shares of the ETF are intended to be offered on the New York Stock Exchange Arca and issued in creation units of 10,000 after regulatory approvals. The S-1 statement filed with the SEC is one of two important documents required before the ETF can go live for trading. The next step involves the exchange filing a Form 19b-4 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, kicking off a review timeline. The crypto Blue Chip ETF filing comes as digital asset-based funds gain popularity among investors in the U.S. Bitcoin ETFs have attracted $50 billion in net inflows since their inception in January 2024. The crypto ETF filing marks the latest high-profile move from Truth Social or related entities to bring crypto exposure to retail and institutional investors via traditional equity markets. Moreover, Trump Media raised over $2.3 billion in May to create a Bitcoin treasury, though the company has yet to announce its first BTC purchase.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/trump-linked-truth-social-files-with-sec-for-crypto-blue-chip-etf-tracking-bitcoin-ether-xrp-and-solana/,"BTC|REGULATION|SOL|XRP|EXCHANGE","Cryptocurrency|Featured|News|Bitcoin News|Donald Trump|ether|SEC|Solana|XRP News",cryptocompare

The promotion has drawn fresh attention to the company’s flagship products, widely regarded as industry benchmarks for secure crypto storage. Together, the Nano S Plus and Nano X boast 13,345 reviews, the majority of which are positive, underscoring the strong trust and satisfaction among users worldwide. But what makes Ledger such a popular hardware wallet? Ledger Wallet’s Blend of Security, Comfort, and Style – this is what makes them so attractive to its loyal fanbase and newbies alike. Ledger excels in the areas of security, comfort level, and overall style, but it’s the wallet’s security features that attract users. Ledger relies on a multi-layered security profile, with several noticeable features, like: ✅ The PIN code that secures the actual device to prevent unauthorized access is required to complete any transaction ✅ The 24-word phrase, which acts as the master key, secures your funds against any malicious access ✅ The trademark Blockchain Open Ledger Operating System (BOLOS), which isolates any installed apps from one another and the 24-word phrase from all apps and the operating system itself ✅ Secure Element Chip, the hardware component that keeps the private keys offline for a higher level of security Plus, Ledger’s Donjon team, which consists of seasoned hackers, is constantly testing the products’ security to identify any potential vulnerabilities. Their efforts are part of Ledger’s Bug Bounty program, which rewards anyone who finds security weaknesses in Bitcoin, showcasing the team’s commitment to continuous improvements in the security department. While security is the most important aspect, other features matter as well, like the comfort level associated with carrying and using the wallet. Ledger’s Nano S Plus and Nano X are the sleekest and most comfortable to use and wear, thanks to their slim builds. Nano S Plus consists of steel and plastic, weighing only 0.74 ounces, while Nano X is slightly larger, thanks to the lithium battery, reaching 1.19 ounces. The slim format makes them comfortable to wear, even as keychains if you always insist on having them with you. Finally, the color palette offers a final touch to the already unique style, imbuing the wallets with a modern vibe. Colors like emerald-green, sapphire-blue, and amethyst-purple come with a plus of personality and X factor. The Massive 30% Discount Ends on July 15 Ledger’s flash promotion (offering a 30% discount on its Nano S Plus and Nano X wallets) is set to end on July 15, giving buyers less than a week to take advantage. The deal aims to spotlight two of Ledger’s most widely used products, with a combined user base of around 7 million worldwide. Most color options are eligible, with only onyx-black and BTC-orange for the Nano X, and matte-black and BTC-orange for the Nano S Plus excluded from the promotion. Should You Buy the Ledger Wallet? Nobody can answer that for you, but if you’ve decided that the Ledger wallet meets your expectations in terms of security, style, and ease of use, and you want to buy it, buy it today. Or, at the very least, until July 15, when the current 30% promotion ends, because discounts like these don’t come often. Also, go to Ledger’s website and scroll through their offers.

2025-07-09T15:30:48,"Elon Musk Drops Epstein ‘Peanut’ Bomb — PNUT Coin Explodes 10%","A sudden social media jab sent Solana’s Peanut the Squirrel token soaring this week. In a Tuesday post, billionaire Elon Musk criticized US authorities for ignoring names on the Jeffrey Epstein “client list”, quipping that “more squirrels and raccoons have been arrested” than any Epstein affiliates. Related Reading: XRP Could Hit $35 If It Captures A Quarter Of Remittance Market By 2029 A nod to a squirrel named Peanut—said to have been “arrested (and killed)”—coincided with a sharp pop in the PNUT token’s value. According to on‑chain data, PNUT climbed over 10% in 24 hours, touching $0.23 at one point. Elon Musk Highlights Justice Concerns Based on reports, Musk’s post racked up more than 13.7 million views within hours. Traders quickly linked “Peanut” to the PNUT ticker. Almost immediately, PNUT price rose from about $0.22 to $0.23. Peanut price up in the last 24 hours. Source: Coingecko The token’s 24‑hour trading volume jumped roughly 80%, crossing $215 million. Market watchers estimate PNUT’s market cap now sits near $224 million, out of a total supply approaching 1 billion tokens. Market Reaction Follows Viral Meme Meme tokens often depend on hype, and PNUT was no exception. After Musk’s message spread, order books filled fast. Buy orders outnumbered sells, driving price momentum. Crypto bots and retail traders piled in, hoping to catch the wave. Some investors told reporters they moved funds into PNUT within minutes of seeing Musk’s post. They arrested (and killed) Peanut, but have not even tried to file charges against anyone on the Epstein client list. Government is deeply broken. pic.twitter.com/YndRadQUBE — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 8, 2025 Token Jump Drives Trading Frenzy Solana’s speedy network helped too. Transactions cleared in seconds, letting traders react without delay. That low‑fee environment amplifies meme coin rallies: when hype hits, people can buy or sell without worrying about high gas costs. In this case, volume spiked from around $120 million to $214 million in under a day. Related Reading: 2% Of All XRP Is In His Hands — But Who Is He? Looking Ahead, Caution Advised Despite the rush, crypto veterans warn that PNUT’s gains could reverse just as fast. Meme tokens lack fundamentals, and hype fades quickly. Traders could face losses if views shift or if Musk moves on to the next joke. For now, Musk’s satirical jab has put Peanut the Squirrel on center stage. Whether PNUT can hold its gains may depend on more viral moments—and on whether investors remember to take profits before the next twist. No ‘Client List’ Meanwhile, according to a memo obtained by Axios, the Justice Department and FBI under US President Donald Trump found no evidence that convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein blackmailed powerful individuals, kept a “client list,” or was murdered.

2025-07-09T15:30:15,"US Senate Bill Targets Bukele’s Bitcoin Strategy With Massive Sanctions Plan","A trio of Senate Democrats has introduced legislation that would not only blacklist President Nayib Bukele and his inner circle but also order a forensic probe of El Salvador’s Bitcoin strategy. Filed on 12 June by Senators Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), the El Salvador Accountability Act of 2025 ( S. 2058 ) sits before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Dems Target El Salvadors Bitcoin Strategy The bill would trigger full economic-blockading powers under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, freeze US-controlled assets of thirteen named Salvadoran officials—including Bukele, Vice-President Félix Ulloa and the president of the Central Reserve Bank—and revoke their visas. It also compels US directors at the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other multilaterals to vote against new loans to San Salvador while cutting off direct US assistance. Section 5 is the measure’s Bitcoin fulcrum. Within 90 days of enactment, the Secretary of State, in consultation with Treasury, must deliver “a report on the actions of officials of the Government of El Salvador, including President Nayib Bukele , to use cryptocurrency as a mechanism for gross corruption, graft, and sanctions evasion,” together with wallet addresses, exchange counterparties and an estimate of the state’s Bitcoin stash. That language resurrects concerns first formalized in the bipartisan Accountability for Cryptocurrency in El Salvador (ACES) Act of 2022, which ordered a risk assessment of Bukele’s original 2021 Bitcoin Law. In January this year, Bukele’s super-majority quietly stripped Bitcoin of its legal-tender status —part of an IMF rescue deal—though the asset remains accepted for payments and sits on the treasury’s balance sheet. The sponsors insist the sanctions push is foremost a human-rights response. “Under President Bukele, tens of thousands of Salvadorans and even US residents remain jammed in megaprisons without due process,” Kaine said on introduction. Van Hollen added that Bukele is “taking American taxpayer dollars to imprison people as part of a scheme to violate their constitutional rights,” while Padilla called the crackdown “abhorrent” and said economic penalties are “a necessary step.” Yet the text’s Bitcoin provisions signal Washington’s broader anxiety that a dollarized economy holding un-audited Bitcoin reserves could morph into a sanctions-evasion node—particularly if the Trump administration were to soften scrutiny. The bill would force the State and Treasury departments to expose addresses, custodians and governance arrangements for the Salvadoran wallets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Volatility Hits Bull Cycle Low – Bollinger Bands Signal Potential Breakout Bukele, never shy on social media, greeted the proposal with characteristic derision. “HAHAHAHAHAHAHA the Dems are just salty…” he wrote on X shortly after the bill went public. Because S. 2058 invokes §502B of the Foreign Assistance Act, any committee member can force it to the floor if the State Department fails to furnish the mandated reports—an arcane privilege the sponsors have already flagged they are prepared to use. Still, Republicans have yet to signal support, and the House remains an open question. If the measure passes intact, the White House would have ten days to list sanctioned individuals and 90 days to deliver the report. Sanctions could not be lifted for at least four years, and only after a presidential certification that El Salvador has ceased both its mass-detention state of exception and any Bitcoin-enabled sanctions evasion, according to the proposed bill.

2025-07-09T15:29:33,"The Evolution of Crypto Trading: From Wild West to Regulated Innovation","The journey of cryptocurrency trading constantly evolves and has been nothing short of revolutionary. Right from the start, the cryptocurrency landscape has been referred to as the “wild west” due to its nature of decentralisation and minimal oversight. However, now the space consists of increasingly sophisticated and regulated financial products and the transformation has been profound. The shift in perception has been a critical development in driving the need for robust frameworks that foster institutional adoption and, crucially, boost investor confidence. In its infancy, crypto trading was the domain of early tech evangelists and a niche community of retail investors leveraging the premise of decentralised permissionless finance. Bitcoin embodied this concept, and exchanges with varying degrees of transparency facilitated the trading of bitcoin and the introduction of other altcoins. Liquidity was thin, price swings were extreme and the lack of regulation meant significant risks for participants. The “wild west” held huge appeal due to the promise of innovation and the disruption of traditional finance. Yet this unregulated environment also bred systemic vulnerabilities, i.e., frequent exchange hacks, pump-and-dump schemes and a lack of consumer protection. Back then, events such as the Mt. Gox collapse deterred larger financial institutions and a broader retail audience from engaging in digital assets. Unknown block type ""divider"", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option We’d love your feedback! CoinDesk is conducting a confidential survey. Start Survey . Unknown block type ""divider"", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option The maturation phase As the crypto market cap swelled, particularly during the ICO boom of 2017 and subsequent bull runs, so did the demand for regulatory oversight. Most regulators adopted a wait-and-see approach; however, incidents within the space, driven by market volatility and concerns over illicit financing, pushed the agenda for regulation forward. The perception and overall sentiment of regulatory oversight have shifted. It is now a common concept that effective regulation is not about stifling innovation, but about supporting and enabling growth and integrating crypto into the broader financial system. Regulation: enabling trust and institutional access What’s underpinning the regulatory shift happening within the industry? It is the recognition that regulation isn’t a hindrance but rather a catalyst for trust and adoption. An example of this is the recent approval of spot bitcoin and ethereum ETFs in major financial markets. These investment products provide institutional and retail investors with exposure to the underlying cryptocurrency through regulated platforms, unlocking massive liquidity and further labelling cryptocurrency as a viable asset class. This development was unimaginable a few years ago. The European Union's comprehensive Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) Regulation , which began to be phased in 2024, is another huge milestone for the evolution of cryptocurrency trading. MiCA aims to create a harmonised regulatory framework across all EU member states, covering the issuance of crypto-assets, their public offering and the services provided by Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs). With the European Union leading the way here, other major government bodies will surely follow. While the early crypto market was a hotbed for speculative assets such as memecoins, the maturation within the space has led to a demand for trading ‘blue-chip’ tokens. These are typically the most liquid and well-capitalised cryptocurrencies that have proven their resilience across various market cycles. Traders are increasingly gravitating towards these more stable assets, seeking long-term growth potential rather than chasing the more risky, fleeting crypto trends. Providers are also leaning towards offering these types of assets as part of their commitment to responsible trading. The ""wild west"" era of crypto trading is fast becoming a distant memory, replaced by a new paradigm of regulated innovation. This evolution is not just vital for the long-term sustainability and mainstream adoption of digital assets, but also for building a more secure and accessible global financial system.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/coindesk-indices/2025/07/09/the-evolution-of-crypto-trading-from-wild-west-to-regulated-innovation,"TRADING|REGULATION|MARKET|BTC|BUSINESS","CoinDesk Indices|Regulation|Institutional Investment|Crypto Long & Short|CoinDesk Indices|Opinion|News",cryptocompare

2025-07-09T15:00:13,"Over 120 Million Cardano (ADA) in Two Weeks. Here’s What Happened","Cardano (ADA) is back in the spotlight after prominent crypto analyst Ali reported a massive accumulation by whales —wallets holding large amounts of cryptocurrency, who have collectively acquired more than 120 million ADA in just the past two weeks. The development, shared via Ali’s post on X, signals a significant shift in investor sentiment, with large players positioning themselves for what could be a strong upward move. Whale Accumulation Signals Renewed Confidence According to Ali’s analysis, this recent buying spree adds to a broader pattern of strategic accumulation by high-net-worth holders. The data shows that these investors are not just buying dips but actively consolidating their positions even amid current price consolidation. Whales bought over 120 million Cardano $ADA in the last two weeks! pic.twitter.com/HOjvzB6fqd — Ali (@ali_charts) July 8, 2025 This behavior suggests a growing confidence in ADA’s long-term value proposition, as whales typically accumulate when they anticipate future price appreciation. On-chain analytics platforms, including IntoTheBlock, confirmed Ali’s findings. Wallets holding between 1 million and 10 million ADA have shown a marked increase in holdings since late June. This spike in accumulation corresponds with a sharp decline in ADA held on exchanges, indicating that whales are moving their tokens into long-term cold storage, another bullish signal. Technical Setup Points to Impending Breakout From a technical standpoint, ADA is currently trading in a tight range between $0.66 and $0.74, with $0.70 serving as a critical resistance level. Analysts note that this zone has capped several recent rally attempts, making it a key area to watch. A decisive breakout above this level could open the door for a move toward $0.83 and potentially $0.91, levels that align with historical Fibonacci retracement targets. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains neutral but has shown bullish divergence on lower timeframes, while rising volume and positive funding rates suggest growing market interest. If price action is confirmed by strong on-chain flows, ADA may soon escape the sideways trend it has followed for much of Q2. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ecosystem Growth May Be Driving Demand Beyond technicals, Cardano’s growing ecosystem is another factor attracting whale attention. Developments like Cardinal, which aims to bring Bitcoin liquidity into Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem, have strengthened the blockchain’s appeal. Additionally, the rising Total Value Locked (TVL) on Cardano-based platforms, now hovering near all-time highs, demonstrates increasing user and developer engagement. There is also growing optimism around the potential for a Cardano Spot ETF soon, especially in the wake of multiple Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF approvals in global markets. Bloomberg analysts have suggested ADA could be among the next wave of crypto assets to gain institutional product access, which may explain the strategic positioning by whales. Outlook: A Pivotal Moment for ADA While Cardano still faces strong resistance at key price levels, the scale of recent whale accumulation cannot be ignored. Ali’s observation is backed by clear on-chain evidence, and if market momentum aligns with the current buying trend, ADA could be poised for a meaningful breakout in the weeks ahead. Investors should keep a close eye on whether ADA can hold above $0.70 and whether whale activity continues at this scale. If both conditions hold, Cardano may be entering a new phase of its market cycle, one marked by institutional accumulation and broader price expansion.

The rally reflects not only strong technical momentum but also growing traction in the protocol’s ecosystem - particularly in Bitcoin-integrated DeFi. The total supply of ckBTC (Chain-Key Bitcoin) on ICP has increased from 254 to 349 tokens since June 9, a 37% rise in under a month, a post on X highlighted . This marks an uptick in Bitcoin inflows into ICP’s DeFi infrastructure, which offers secures fast interoperability. On the price action side, ICP traded within a $0.21 range between $4.73 and $4.93, with a clear upward bias. Momentum intensified with volume bursts and higher-lows structure. The surge from $4.90 to $4.93 during the 10:41–11:40 UTC window was powered by institutional-style accumulation, peaking at 59,999 units at 11:29 UTC, well above the daily average. ICP had held support at $4.73, and a successful retest of $4.90 at 10:52 UTC confirmed it as a new support floor. With structural strength in place, growing ecosystem usage, and DeFi-driven demand from ckBTC, ICP appears well-positioned to challenge the next upside milestone. Technical Analysis Highlights ICP gained 3% over 24 hours, trading between $4.73 and $4.93. Support held firm at $4.73, forming the base for the rally. Breakout above $4.90 was confirmed at 10:59 UTC with strong follow-through. Volume surges at 11:23 (33,830 units), 11:28 (27,673 units), and 11:29 (59,999 units) indicate accumulation.

2025-07-09T14:51:07,"Solana at critical decision point: will SOL breakout to $176 or tumble to $131?","Solana is testing a highly technical resistance zone. A breakout could trigger a move toward $176, while a rejection risks a return to the $131 support level. Volume confirmation remains the deciding factor. Solana’s ( SOL ) price action is approaching a critical inflection point. After reclaiming the point of control within its current trading range, the asset is now challenging a dense resistance cluster. The outcome at this level, whether a breakout or a rejection, will likely determine the next major move. A breakout could initiate a bullish expansion toward the $176 region, while failure to overcome this confluence zone would suggest continued range-bound behavior between $154 and $131. Key technical points Reclaimed Point of Control: Price action has returned above the volume-weighted average zone. Stacked Resistance at $154: Includes the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement and anchored VWAP from highs. Volume Still Lacking: Breakout must be supported by volume or risks invalidation. SOLUSDT (1D) Chart, Source: TradingView Solana recently rebounded from a key swing low just below $130, triggering a strong upward move that peaked at $187. Since then, the price has been confined within a defined range, oscillating between the value area high near $154 and the value area low around $131. Reclaiming the point of control signaled renewed interest from buyers, but the current rally is encountering significant headwinds. Price is now testing a technically dense resistance region marked by two major confluences: the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement from the previous swing high and the anchored VWAP drawn from the top of the range. This dual-layered resistance makes the area structurally significant, and difficult to break without strong momentum. You might also like: DNSBTC celebrates 2m users with free BTC, LTC cloud mining contracts If Solana fails to reclaim this resistance zone on a closing candle basis, a move back toward the $131 support level is likely. This would keep price locked within the broader range and reinforce the rotational structure of the current market. However, if resistance is broken decisively, and most importantly, with supporting volume, the probability of a bullish expansion increases significantly. The next target would be the $176 region, aligning with a prior swing high and high time frame resistance. A key variable to watch here is volume. The current push higher has occurred with declining participation, raising the risk of a false breakout. If demand fails to materialize near the highs, price is likely to rotate lower once again. What to expect in the coming price action Solana is at a technical crossroads. A breakout above $154, backed by volume, opens the path to $176. Failure to reclaim this zone increases the likelihood of a rotation back to the $131 support area.

The company announced that its short-term objective is to acquire 3,000 BTC , although this target may be adjusted based on Bitcoin’s market price and Remixpoint’s stock performance (3825.T). In a July 9 statement translated from Japanese, Remixpoint explained, “ We have become even more convinced of Bitcoin’s future, and this decision is the result of extensive discussions to enhance corporate value from a risk-return perspective, while also keeping future options open. “ リミックスポイント本日開示 ファイナンスにて約315億円資金調達 資金使途、全額BTC取得 目先『3000BTC保有』を目指す ※BTC価格、株価により変動あり （初回以降は3日連続取引日の平均株価） 背景 より一層ビットコインの未来に確信を 持ち、議論を重ねた結果となります。… — リミックスポイント公式Xアカウント (@remixpoint_x) July 9, 2025 Japanese Remixpoint Building on Existing Bitcoin Strategy Remixpoint has been accumulating Bitcoin since September 2024, establishing itself as a significant corporate holder in the cryptocurrency space. According to Bitcoin treasuries data, Remixpoint ranks as the 30th publicly listed company by Bitcoin holdings with 1,051 BTC, surpassing firms like Nano Labs and The Smarter Web Company at the time of writing. The company’s commitment to Bitcoin was demonstrated earlier this year when it approved a ¥1 billion ($7 million) Bitcoin purchase following a board resolution in May. Japan’s Remixpoint approves another $7M Bitcoin purchase, raising total crypto holdings to $84M. #Japan #Remixpoint #Bitcoin https://t.co/ozpqS3v3QL — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 26, 2025 Beyond Bitcoin, Remixpoint has expanded its digital asset holdings to include Ethereum ( ETH ), Solana ( SOL ), and Avalanche ( AVAX ). In September 2024, the firm invested approximately $351,700 to acquire 130.1 ETH , 2,260.5 SOL, and 12,269.9 AVAX tokens. The Japanese firm’s crypto commitment extends to executive compensation, with the company becoming the first Tokyo Stock Exchange-listed entity to pay its CEO and President entirely in Bitcoin. According to the report, CEO Yoshihiko Takahashi characterized this decision as a “ clear signal ” of his commitment to corporate value and shareholder-focused governance. Moreover, Remixpoint’s stock price has demonstrated a strong correlation with Bitcoin’s performance, benefiting from the cryptocurrency’s success. When Bitcoin reached its lows of $77,000 in April, 3825.T shares traded at ¥328 ($2.26). As Bitcoin climbed above $109,000 in May, the stock price more than doubled to ¥701 ($4.88).

Growing Japanese Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Remixpoint’s strategy aligns with an emerging trend among publicly listed companies that incorporate Bitcoin into their balance sheets. While U.S.-based companies like MicroStrategy have popularized this approach , Remixpoint joins a growing list of Japanese firms adopting similar models. Metaplanet, another Bitcoin-focused Japanese company, has consistently expanded its holdings of BTC.

In April, NASDAQ-listed Japanese beauty and cosmetic surgery clinic operator SBC Medical Group Holdings completed a Bitcoin purchase worth over $418,000 . Moreover, Japan’s evolving regulatory landscape is supporting the increased adoption of cryptocurrencies. The country is preparing to formally recognize crypto assets as financial products under its Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and is moving toward approving Bitcoin ETFs. These developments are expected to encourage more Japanese companies and citizens to embrace Bitcoin and cryptocurrency investments. Government officials are also considering Bitcoin as a reserve asset.

2025-07-09T14:39:18,"Cantor Equity Partners: Waiting On Merger With Twenty One Capital","Summary Cantor Equity Partners is merging with Twenty One Holdings to create a Bitcoin-focused entity, measuring performance in Bitcoin terms. Twenty One will introduce Bitcoin Per Share and Bitcoin Return Rate as new performance metrics for shareholders. Current share conversion ratios for Cantor Equity Partners are examined to determine if CEP represents an opportunity. Cantor Equity Partners ( CEP ) announced a reverse merger on April 22, 2025, which will merge into a new entity, Twenty One Capital Inc. Cantor Equity Partners was incorporated in 2020 under a different name, and in June 2024, the company changed its name and prepared for its IPO in August 2024. Currently, if an investor wants to invest before the merger becomes official, they must purchase Cantor Equity Partners' shares. The purpose of this article will be to examine shares of Cantor Equity Partners to determine the opportunity at hand in the case that the merger is completed. Investors Several interesting parties have come together to spearhead this merger. This impressive list of investors will be major voices in determining the direction of the company. Bitfinex Bitfinex is a cryptocurrency exchange headquartered in the British Virgin Islands and is contributing 7,000 bitcoins to the merger. Given their expertise in Bitcoin exchange operations, they could be a valuable partner to the company. Bitfinex will be one of the largest shareholders, along with those mentioned below. Softbank Group Softbank, headquartered in Tokyo, Japan, is a major investor in the new company and is contributing approximately $900 million in capital. They are projected to hold 26.1% of shares when the merger is completed. Tether Tether, the largest USD stablecoin issuer, will be the majority shareholder in the company. There is a gray area surrounding how much ownership will be given to these major shareholders, but Tether is expected to hold nearly 50 percent of the equity and greater than 50 percent of the voting power. The following table shows a breakdown of what ownership will look like before and after the conversion of some convertible notes offered in the deal. This graphic was sourced from an article on CoinDesk describing the merger. Pre and Post Convert Twenty One Shares (Twenty One Capital Presentation ) Management & Friends CEO Jack Mallers Well-known Bitcoin investor and entrepreneur Jack Mallers will lead the company while also leading his current company, Strike. Strike is a Bitcoin company that offers various Bitcoin-related services. Here is a statement from Jack Mallers on what he hopes Twenty One Capital will become. We believe that Bitcoin is the answer, and Twenty One is how we bring that answer to public markets. Our mission is simple: to become the most successful company in Bitcoin, the most valuable financial opportunity of our time. We’re not here to beat the market, we’re here to build a new one. A public stock, built by Bitcoiners, for Bitcoiners. Friends in High Places Howard Lutnick formerly served as the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, where he reportedly invested over $1 billion into Strategy, the original Bitcoin treasury company. This was prior to Lutnick stepping down as CEO to serve as the Secretary of Commerce inside the Trump administration. With Lutnick no longer the CEO, his son Brandon Lutnick now leads Cantor Fitzgerald. This is another key relationship for the company that will potentially give it unique access to capital markets. Creating Value Twenty One, headquartered in New York City, will be concentrated on creating value in Bitcoin terms. It remains to be seen what their exact strategy will be, but we know they will be measuring their company's performance in Bitcoin. Will they implement a strategy similar to the company now known as Strategy...formerly MicroStrategy (Strategy) ( MSTR )? Here is a quote from Cantor's press release . As part of its launch, Twenty One will introduce two key performance metrics, to reflect its Bitcoin-denominated capital structure and Bitcoin-focused mindset. Bitcoin Per Share ((BPS)): Amount of Bitcoin each fully-diluted share represents, reflecting shareholder ownership in Bitcoin rather than fiat earnings per share. Bitcoin Return Rate (BRR): Rate at which BPS grows over time, denominating the company’s performance in Bitcoin. Bitcoin Treasury Companies and Market Net Asset Value (MNAV) Currently, Bitcoin treasury companies are often valued in terms of their market net asset value, or MNAV, which is a measure of the market value of the Bitcoin they own, less any debt on the balance sheet. Strategy Since Twenty One will be a Bitcoin treasury company, much like Strategy currently is, it is appropriate to measure them in relation to the amount of Bitcoin they will hold when the merger is completed, as well as relative to how Strategy is being valued. As of Strategy's latest press release , the company owns 580,250 bitcoin. As of 7/8/2025, Bitcoin is valued at $109,000, giving Strategy an asset value of over $68 billion. Strategy's total debt is $10.4 billion as of their March 2025 financial report, leaving them with an MNAV of about $57.6 billion. Their current market cap is $112 billion, giving them an MNAV of just below two. Twenty One Capital and Its Bitcoin Holdings Twenty One Holdings expects the company to hold around 42,000 bitcoins post-merger, which would make it the second largest Bitcoin treasury company behind Strategy and the third public company Bitcoin treasury behind Strategy and MARA Holdings ( MARA ). With Bitcoin's price at $109,000, it places the market value of their Bitcoin at around $4.6 billion. Cantor Equity Partners Conversion Ratio The proposed merger is a reverse merger where the Cantor Equity Partners shares will convert into shares of Twenty One Holdings with the ticker symbol XXI. Public SPAC holders of Cantor Equity Partners are expected to hold 2.7 percent of the company after the merger is finalized. The company is expected to hold somewhere in the range of 42,000 bitcoins, meaning the market value of its Bitcoin at today's price is (42,000 x $109,000) about $4.6 billion. Now, if we apply a similar MNAV to Cantor Equity Partners as Strategy currently has, that equals a projected market capitalization of $9.2 billion, assuming the company has no debt. Cantor Equity Partners currently has 10 million Class A shares outstanding and a couple of million Class B shares as well, but it's unclear how all of that will convert to shares of Twenty One. For simplicity's sake, I'm going to assume there are around 10 million shares, and those will convert 1 to 1 into XXI shares, as we saw in the table graphic above. There are expected to be 371 million shares outstanding in the new entity, Twenty One Capital. Of the SPAC equity owners, they will receive 10 million shares of the 371 million shares outstanding, or in this case, a 1 to 1 conversion. If that is in fact what happens, each CEP share will be worth ~$25/share, assuming a total valuation of $9.2 billion ($9.2 billion/371 million shares). In the past month, Cantor Equity Partners' price has declined from its all-time high near $55 per share down to around $30 per share. This has it approaching a similar MNAV valuation as Strategy...around two times. Risks The risks of buying Cantor Equity Partners are varied. First, you are buying a Bitcoin treasury company that will have a pure exposure to owning Bitcoin. If you don't want to own Bitcoin, then owning shares of Cantor Equity Partners won't be advisable. Second, we don't have insight into the strategy of the new company, Twenty One Capital. If you buy Cantor Equity Partners today, then you are buying it blindly with the expectation that they will successfully implement their strategy to acquire more Bitcoin per share. And it is certainly possible and even likely that they do, but we don't have insight into how they plan to do that at the moment. Third, although the conversion ratio of Cantor Equity Partners shares is approximately expected to be 1 to 1, we won't know exactly how the conversion will look until after the merger takes place. Will the conversion ratio be 1 to 1, or will it be something less than that. Fourth, as we wait for the merger to finalize, Bitcoin might appreciate significantly, but with a certain degree of unknowns surrounding the merger, Cantor Equity Partners may fail to appreciate in price as fully as an established Bitcoin treasury company like Strategy. This represents an opportunity cost that is present with any investment. Conclusion I would consider Cantor Equity Partners as a hold for the moment. If you already own shares, I would not sell, but it might be prudent to wait for the conversion into XXI shares to get a better idea of the value proposition. I think the new shares of XXI will be worth researching to understand their strategy to increase shareholder returns in Bitcoin terms. The company will have a very impressive list of shareholders, which could come together to create compelling value as they find creative ways to bring Bitcoin to new and existing capital markets. As an alternative strategy to buying Cantor Equity Partners, one might hold Strategy shares until the merger takes place and convert shares into XXI shares after the merger. But for now, I rate Cantor Equity Partners a hold.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4800150-cantor-equity-partners-waiting-on-merger-with-twenty-one-capital?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|BUSINESS|SPONSORED","CEP",cryptocompare
2025-07-09T14:39:09,"Whales That Started the Previous Ethereum Bull Run Are Back in Action! What Does It Mean for ETH?","Ethereum (ETH) has been more prominent than Bitcoin (BTC) in recent days. At this point, as institutions are rapidly switching from Bitcoin to ETH, million-dollar purchases are coming one after another. This suggests that Ethereum is gaining bullish momentum amid rising institutional inflows. Cryptocurrency market analysis firm 10X Research has noted in its new analysis that Ethereum is currently trading above both its 7-day and 30-day moving averages, indicating strong bullish momentum. ETH gained 3.6% last week, driven by $148.5 million in ETF inflows. BlackRock’s spot ETH ETF ETHA remains the market leader with $4.6 billion in assets under management (AUM). In other news, BitMine Immersion Technologies raised $250 million to implement an ETH-based treasury strategy, while SharpLink Gaming recently purchased $22.8 million worth of ETH, a sign of growing institutional demand and renewed investor confidence. Related News: Ethereum's MicroStrategy Receives ETH Purchase Again From Nasdaq-Listed Company! ""Retains Its Position as the World's Largest ETH Holder!"" Apart from 10X Research, Glassnode also announced its Ethereum analysis. At this point, Glassnode stated that aggressive whale purchases and the current situation could allow ETH to reach $3.4 thousand by August. Glassnode expects the strong buying frenzy by Ethereum whales to push the ETH price higher, data shows. At this point, the total amount of ETH held by whales holding at least 10,000 ETH increased by 9.31% from 37.56 million in October of last year to 41.06 million as of July 7. These figures also indicate that the pace of accumulation in the May-September 2022 period has almost doubled. At this point, analysts particularly pointed out that whales made similar aggressive purchases between November 2020 and January 2021, the amount of ETH held by whales increased by 4%, and then the ETH price skyrocketed from $ 460 to $ 1,220. *This is not investment advice.

In a new interview posted on the Fundstrat YouTube channel, Lee says that Bitcoin adoption is going to expand massively, and predicts banks will even start holding the flagship crypto asset. “95% of investors have zero Bitcoin exposure. So you’re still way ahead if you’re buying Bitcoin today. If you look at Bitcoin wallets, comparing it to the Internet, we’re back to 1996 levels. The Internet went exponential from 1996. So it’s still the earliest days. I think Bitcoin is very useful, because in the future we’re not going to be able to trust anything. There’s nothing secure anymore. We can sample your voice… You’ll never know what’s true anymore. You need to be able to trust a system. The Bitcoin blockchain is the most trusted blockchain, and that’s why the United States wants to have a million Bitcoin, US companies are buying Bitcoin [and] banks will soon carry Bitcoin as collateral.” Bitcoin is trading for $108,845 at time of writing, flat on the day. Lee also says that Ethereum is likely to surge in value due to the increasing popularity of stablecoins, which mostly operate over the ETH network. “Stablecoins run on Ethereum. As stablecoins explode…Ethereum is the backbone for stablecoins. So I think Ethereum is going to make a big comeback.” Ethereum is trading for $2,608 at time of writing, up 2.9% in the last 24 hours.

2025-07-09T14:19:34,"Top 4 reasons a major crypto bull run could be on the horizon","Bitcoin and most altcoins have remained in a narrow range this month as trade and interest rate risks persist. Bitcoin ( BTC ) has been stuck at $108,000, while altcoins like Ethereum ( ETH ) and Cardano ( ADA ) have moved sideways. Here are the top four reasons why a crypto bull run may still happen this year. Bitcoin price is on the cusp of a breakout Technical indicators suggest that Bitcoin is poised for a bullish breakout. The asset has formed a bullish flag pattern, characterized by a vertical pole followed by a descending channel. This flag formation overlaps with the handle section of a broader cup-and-handle pattern. The cup has a depth of roughly 30%, projecting a potential target above $140,000. Similarly, the flagpole measures approximately 35%. Projecting that distance from the breakout level at $109,300 points to a target exceeding $145,000. A strong move above this level could spark a broader crypto rally. Bitcoin price chart | Source: crypto.news Altcoins have formed bullish reversal patterns Most altcoins have developed the well-known bullish double-bottom reversal pattern. This formation emerged after a drop in April, a rebound in May, and a subsequent retest of April’s lows. Additionally, excluding Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins, altcoins have also formed a bullish falling wedge pattern, defined by two downward-sloping, converging trendlines. The upper trendline has tested swing highs since February 1, while the lower line tracks lows since February 7. The price has since broken above the wedge’s upper boundary, signaling further gains, potentially toward the May high of $0.348. Altcoins valuation ratio | Source: TradingView You might also like: Zebec Network price jumps 20% following invitation to speak on regulation at UK House of Lords Potential trade deals From a macroeconomic standpoint, the U.S. could finalize several trade agreements by the end of the month. It has already reached deals with China, Vietnam, and the U.K., and preparations are underway for an agreement with the European Union. The main headline this week was a series of letters former President Trump sent to various countries, reaffirming that he won’t shift the August 1 deadline. However, much like with previous China negotiations, the letters are seen as a pressure tactic to accelerate deals. A broader trade agreement would likely boost both equity and crypto markets. Interest rate cuts An additional catalyst for a crypto bull run is the expectation of upcoming interest rate cuts. Economists anticipate the Federal Reserve could begin easing as early as its September meeting, provided inflation data continues to improve.

2025-07-09T14:16:48,"Bitcoin braces for tariff shock, but ETFs could cushion the blow","Ongoing tariff risks could hurt Bitcoin’s safe haven narrative in the short term, according to a Bitfinex expert. Bitcoin’s (BTC) bullish case has long relied on its role as a hedge against inflation and geopolitical risk. However, the asset is now facing pressure from evolving U.S. trade policy, Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, said in comments to crypto.news. That said, Kooner noted that Bitcoin holds advantages it lacked in previous cycles—particularly growing institutional adoption and increasing exchange-traded fund flows. These developments could make BTC more resilient than equities in the face of geopolitical uncertainty. “New US tariffs would likely trigger classic risk-off reflexes with equity weakness, dollar strength, yield softness. But unlike past cycles, crypto now enjoys structural ETF support and sovereign hedge narrative,” said Jag Kooner, from Bitfinex. “While BTC may dip initially alongside equities, any tariff-induced inflation expectations or dollar weakening could feed back into crypto rates positively,” he added. Thanks to growing institutional adoption, more firms may now view Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and macroeconomic volatility, especially if the dollar continues its downward trend, Kooner added.

Bitcoin’s near-term catalysts to watch for In addition to inflation and trade concerns, there are other potential catalysts to watch for, Kooner stated. Specifically, traders will be looking at regulatory developments, especially those connected to the upcoming GENIUS Act. “Bitcoin’s climb near all-time highs is anchored by consistent ETF flows and strong institutional interest. The upcoming catalysts: legislative clarity, ETF innovation, tariff news, and inflation prints serve as potential accelerants,” Jag Kooner, Bitfinex. If Bitcoin breaks above its all-time high at $111,000, this could confirm a bullish trend in the near term, according to Kooner. However, a significant macro shock could push the asset back down to support between $105,000 and $108,000.

2025-07-09T14:07:50,"NEXBRIDGE and NEXPLACE Raise $8M Series A to Launch Integrated Bitcoin Capital Markets Ecosystem","July 9th, 2025 – San Salvador, El Salvador The raise will accelerate the development of a dual infrastructure: NEXBRIDGE, a regulated issuer of asset-backed digital assets, and NEXPLACE, a next-generation trading platform. NEXBRIDGE and NEXPLACE today announced the closing of a $8 million Series A funding round led by Fulgur Ventures. The capital will fast-track the expansion of a Bitcoin-native financial infrastructure that merges regulated issuance with seamless trading for retail and institutional clients worldwide. Early access to NEXPLACE is now available — users can join the waitlist here . NEXBRIDGE will use the proceeds to launch new digital assets and pursue additional listings across licensed exchanges. NEXPLACE will accelerate development and go-to-market execution ahead of its H2 2025 launch, while advancing further licensing efforts in key jurisdictions. NEXBRIDGE and NEXPLACE currently operate as separate entities, but share the same shareholder group and strategic roadmap— with plans to consolidate under a single holding once the necessary corporate and jurisdictional steps are completed. “Our vision for BitcoinFi is simple: bring the safeguards of traditional capital markets onto Bitcoin rails and make digital assets accessible with 24/7 efficiency— through compliant, global infrastructure,” said Michele Crivelli, Founder & CEO of both companies. Today we focus on secure access to familiar exposures like bonds or equities—made available through NEXPLACE and other licensed venues, with our own platform built to evolve and unlock advanced features over time. Tomorrow, we’ll enable businesses to raise capital on-chain through native, regulated digital instruments designed to move funds directly to the issuer, without traditional intermediaries.” A new on-chain market architecture NEXBRIDGE issues regulated digital assets backed by real underlying value, offering both familiar exposures and new formats for accessing them. In November 2024, NEXBRIDGE launched USTBL—the first public, regulated digital asset backed by U.S. Treasury Bills and issued on Bitcoin infrastructure via the Liquid Network. Initially listed on Bitfinex Securities, USTBL is now preparing to expand across additional licensed exchanges. Following this, El Salvador’s digital?asset regulator (CNAD) approved a broader range of products—spanning from single-stock exposures to multi-asset strategies—set to launch on NEXPLACE and other licensed venues, including through NEXBRIDGE’s own OTC desk. NEXPLACE, licensed as a Digital Asset Service Provider, offers a unified venue for trading a wide range of digital assets—from native cryptocurrencies and utility tokens to asset-linked instruments. Advanced features—such as using eligible tokenized assets as collateral for derivatives—will be gradually rolled out following launch. Unlike models where tokenized assets are mere digital wrappers of off-chain products, NEXBRIDGE issues digital assets that are regulated at the token level. Each issuance is formally approved by CNAD, receives a unique instrument identifier, and includes public disclosures such as proof-of-reserve attestations and a dedicated termsheet detailing key information. In this model, transparency and regulatory oversight apply directly to the digital asset users hold and trade—not just to the structure behind it. While initial distribution will occur primarily via NEXPLACE, the infrastructure is designed for openness. NEXBRIDGE’s regulatory architecture allows its assets to be listed on other licensed trading venues—ensuring portability. This dual model bridges two worlds: providing secure, regulated access to digital markets for global users—especially those in fast-growing emerging economies—while giving institutions a simplified interface to manage both crypto and asset-linked positions with full transparency. “This raise helps us unlock a new generation of asset-linked digital products—especially for users in markets where access to dollar-based exposure has been limited,” Crivelli added. “Each token we issue is directly regulated, with its own public termsheet, governance, and oversight—rather than being a passive mirror of an off-chain asset. That’s a structural shift – and a foundation we can build on.” Strategic alignment and investor support Fulgur Ventures, the lead investor, supports Bitcoin?native infrastructure with real?world applications. “Bitcoin continues to establish itself as a unique, scarce digital asset—now increasingly relevant to institutional finance,” said Oleg Mikhalsky, Partner at Fulgur Ventures. “Traditional financial institutions are beginning to recognize Bitcoin not only as a store of value but also as a settlement layer for both monetary transactions and tokenized instruments. NEXBRIDGE and NEXPLACE demonstrate a meaningful, real-world use case enabled by the Liquid Network that reinforces Bitcoin’s role in capital markets—a development Fulgur is proud to support.” Blockstream — the Bitcoin infrastructure firm behind the Liquid Network layer-2 that powers asset issuance and settlement — emphasized the partnership’s strategic potential. “By powering NEXBRIDGE’s digital asset issuance and NEXPLACE’s trading platform with the Liquid Network, we’re helping shape a new generation of capital markets—anchored to Bitcoin’s security, built for global scale, said Adam Back, Co?founder & CEO of Blockstream.

2025-07-09T14:04:07,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Hackers Target $8.7B Mt. Gox Wallet – Could a Breach Trigger Market Chaos?","Bitcoin is trading near $109,690 today, following a clean breakout above $109,000. But behind the price action, a historic BTC address tied to the Mt. Gox hack is back in the spotlight, and not for good reasons. According to BitMEX Research , scammers are targeting the wallet that received 79,956 BTC back in 2011, now worth over $8.7 billion. The method? A phishing transaction embedded with OP_RETURN, a tool that lets users write text directly onto Bitcoin’s blockchain. This particular message pointed the wallet owner to a suspicious website pretending to be from Salomon Brothers. There appears to be an ongoing Bitcoin scam occurring. Someone is sending old 2011 era Bitcoin addresses with balances, transactions with an OP_Return output. For instance the 1Feex… address, with c80,000 BTC stolen from MtGox. The OP_Return message is as follows “NOTICE TO… pic.twitter.com/lAT5ONPD4f — BitMEX Research (@BitMEXResearch) July 8, 2025 The wallet, long untouched, is part of the fallout from the Mt. Gox collapse, where 850,000 BTC vanished. Only 140,000 BTC have since been recovered, and many remaining coins sit idle in addresses like this one. This scam attempt isn’t just noise; it taps into broader market concerns about legacy wallets, lost coins, and what might happen if they move. While no breach has occurred, the timing aligns with a breakout on the chart, giving traders even more reason to stay alert. BTC/USD Breakout Above Triangle Structure ßOn the 2-hour chart, BTC broke through the upper boundary of a symmetrical triangle that had been forming since early July. That range had been squeezing tighter with higher lows and lower highs, so a volatility expansion was expected. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The price is now trading above the 50-period SMA ($108,550), and the structure is turning bullish again. The RSI is at 63.39, showing firm momentum without crossing into overbought territory. In short, buyers are in control—but not in a state of panic. Bitcoin breaks above $109K just as scammers target a dormant $8.7B Mt. Gox wallet. Clean symmetrical triangle breakout with RSI confirmation. Bulls eye $110.5K–$110.9K next. Structure looks solid unless we drop back below $108.2K. Watching the retest. #BTC #Crypto pic.twitter.com/hmIVXPEFiG — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) July 9, 2025 Resistance levels to watch are: $110,051 – prior swing high $110,550 – a clean breakout continuation zone $110,960 – extended resistance from June Trade Setup: Symmetrical Breakout with Retest Potential Here’s how I’d structure this trade: Breakout Strategy Entry: Above $109,200 (confirmed 2H breakout) Stop-loss: Below $108,250 (SMA + lower triangle line) Target 1: $110,051 Target 2: $110,550 Extended Target: $110,960 The breakout happened cleanly, and price held above the key moving average. If volume picks up, there’s room for this to run another 1–2% before facing real resistance. I’m watching how price behaves around $110K—if it stalls, partial profit makes sense. Retest Option If we get a dip back to $109,200, I’d look for a rejection candle (hammer or bullish engulfing) for a tighter re-entry. In my experience, these symmetrical triangle breakouts often come with one shakeout move before continuation. For now, the setup remains valid unless we see a daily close back below $108,250. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Over $2M as Price Rise Nears Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), has raised over $2 million in its public presale, with $2,061,881 out of a $2,510,240 target. The token is priced at $0.012175, with the next price tier expected to be announced soon. Designed to merge Bitcoin’s security with Solana’s speed, Bitcoin Hyper enables fast, low-cost smart contracts, dApps, and meme coin creation, all with seamless BTC bridging. The project is audited by Consult and engineered for scalability, trust, and simplicity. The golden cross of meme appeal and real utility has made Bitcoin Hyper a Layer 2 contender to watch in 2025.

2025-07-09T14:00:18,"Bitcoin Hits Record High, But Mainstream Media Coverage Remains Sparse and Divided:  Report","Bitcoin surge to an all-time high during the second quarter did not translate into substantial mainstream media coverage, with new data revealing a polarized and low-volume reporting landscape. Market intelligence firm Perception reported that only 1,116 articles on Bitcoin and crypto were published across 18 major media outlets during Q2, reflecting what it described as a “deeply polarized narrative landscape.” Perception’s report, released on Tuesday, noted that sentiment across outlets was split: 31% of articles were positive toward Bitcoin, 41% remained neutral, while 28% carried a negative tone. Despite BTC’s record performance, the firm highlighted that elite financial publications left a vacuum in informed crypto reporting. Elite Financial Media Largely Absent The report pointed out a significant lack of coverage from leading financial outlets. News Corp’s The Wall Street Journal published just two Bitcoin-related articles throughout Q2 , while the Financial Times and The New York Times together published only 11 articles in the same period. These three publications accounted for merely 2% of all mainstream Bitcoin and crypto coverage during the quarter. Perception argued that this limited attention from agenda-setting outlets has led to a fragmented information environment around BTC, potentially leaving investors uninformed about a transformative asset class. “Investors relying on elite financial media for market intelligence are systematically underinformed,” the report stated. Several Narratives Shaping Public Perception According to Perception, mainstream media outlets have approached Bitcoin with three primary narratives: “enthusiastic adoption,” “willful blindness,” and “persistent skepticism.” Outlets like Forbes and CNBC fell into the first category, providing extensive and optimistic coverage of BTC and crypto. In contrast, the Wall Street Journal and Financial Times demonstrated what Perception termed “willful blindness,” offering minimal coverage despite Bitcoin’s significant market developments. Traditional media outlets, meanwhile, maintained a “persistent skepticism,” focusing on crime and controversy within the crypto industry. Content analysis from the report revealed differing topic priorities across publications. Forbes highlighted retail and institutional adoption along with Bitcoin mining, while CNBC focused heavily on banking, finance, and investment vehicles. Fortune covered mining, finance, and market analysis, while Fox News concentrated on legal issues, crime, and cybersecurity concerns related to crypto. Perception concluded that this uneven coverage fosters “information asymmetry,” complicating the landscape for investors seeking consistent and clear reporting on BTC as it continues to evolve into a mainstream financial asset.

2025-07-09T14:00:11,"Analyst Predicts 50% “Moonshot” For XRP Price If This Line Breaks","Crypto analyst Jaydee has predicted a 50% rally for the XRP price. He highlighted a resistance level, which the altcoin needs to break above on its BTC pair to record this massive uptrend. XRP Price Eyes 50% Rally With Break Above $2.20 In an X post, Jaydee predicted that the XRP price will record a 50% “moonshot” rally once it breaks above the $0.00002 resistance level on its Bitcoin pair. XRP has since broken above this resistance level, suggesting that this moonshot rally may be imminent, with the altcoin surging to as high as $3.35. Related Reading: Analyst Reveals Rational Behind XRP Price Reaching $9.5 And $37.5 A rally to $3.35 will bring the XRP price close to its current all-time high (ATH) of $3.84 and also mark a new yearly high for the altcoin. In a subsequent analysis, Jaydee confirmed that XRP could rally to new ATHs with a successful break above this resistance level. On the other hand, he warned that the altcoin could crash to as low as $1.60 if it fails to hold this level on at least the 3-day timeframe. Crypto analyst Guy also recently predicted that the XRP price could rally to a new ATH of $5.30. The analyst indicated that the $2.33 level is the key to kickstarting this uptrend for the altcoin. Once XRP breaks above, he predicts that it will rally to $2.55. A break above this $2.55 level would then pave the way for another rally to the current ATH and the Fibonacci extension at $5.30. Possible Scenarios Following Break Above $2.30 In an X post, crypto analyst CasiTrades outlined three potential scenarios that could unfold following the XRP price break above $2.30. The first scenario is the cleanest move, in which she predicts that XRP could run towards $2.45, then flips $2.30 into support on a backtest. CasiTrades remarked that this gives the altcoin a solid base for a move to $2.69 and beyond. Related Reading: Will XRP Dethrone Ethereum To Lead This Altcoin Season? For the second scenario, the crypto analyst described this as a more aggressive move. In this case, she predicts that the XRP price could record a sharp breakout through $2.30 and head straight to $2.69. From there, she added that the altcoin could pull back to $2.45 as the mid-way support zone before continuing its uptrend. The third scenario is the most bullish for the XRP price. CasiTrades predicts that the altcoin could break through $2.69, confirm this price level as support, and then clear the way towards $3 and above. This would then put the current ATH in sight for the altcoin. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.32, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

2025-07-09T13:57:18,"Profitability Rates for Long-Term Bitcoin Investors Approach Critical Level! Could Selling Pressure Be Possible? Here Are the Details","According to crypto analysts, long-term Bitcoin investors (LTH) are making 215% more profit than their average cost, which could trigger a potential sell-off. Long-Term Bitcoin Investors Approach Critical Profitability Threshold: Is a Market Sell-Off Imminent? Data shows that long-term investors typically sell after exceeding the 300% return threshold, taking profits. Currently, while investors are still far from this threshold, the market has entered a critical zone between “steady profit-taking” and “risk of a sharp sell-off.” This type of investor behavior typically signals a market turning point, and analysts warn that significant Bitcoin price volatility could occur if large-scale profit-taking begins at these levels. According to experts, despite investor pressure to take profits, the overall market structure remains strong. However, if the 300% profitability threshold is breached, particularly if combined with macroeconomic conditions or negative news flow, there could be significant selling by long-term investors. This could lead to a sharp correction in Bitcoin's price. In summary, the market is currently on the cusp between a controlled profit-taking and a long-term sell-off. The coming weeks will be critical for investors to determine which direction this threshold will be crossed. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-09T13:56:07,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Marginally Up As Markets Wait For Next Catalyst","Bitcoin (BTC) price action picked up during the ongoing session, with the flagship cryptocurrency up nearly 1% as buyers attempted to cross the crucial $110,000 mark. BTC started the week in the red, dropping nearly 1% on Monday before recovering on Tuesday, rising from a low of $107,446 to $108,938. The price is up almost 1% during the ongoing session, trading around $109,516. Remixpoint Moves To Align CEO With Bitcoin Strategy Remixpoint has announced that new CEO Takashi Tashiro will be paid in Bitcoin as part of efforts to be “in the same boat” as shareholders. The company said it will calculate Tashiro’s salary and taxes, purchase the equivalent amount in BTC , and transfer it to a wallet Tashiro chooses. According to the company, the move is part of a “shareholder-oriented management.” “The remuneration in this case will be paid in Japanese yen in format based on the appropriate organization of the Company Act and taxation. On top of that, we plan to acquire Bitcoin (BTC) equivalent to the same amount at the market price with Japanese yen, which is equivalent to the full amount of the payment, and deliver it to the crypto asset wallet designated by the President and CEO.” Tashiro took over as Remixpoint CEO in June, stating the firm will put BTC at the heart of its financial strategy. H100 Raises $54 Million For Bitcoin Treasury H100 Group AB, a Swedish health-tech firm focusing on AI-driven health solutions, has closed two key funding rounds, raising $54 million. The firm raised capital via a directed share issue (Tranche 6, issuing 27.17 million shares at SEK 6.38), and a directed convertible debenture issue (Tranche 7, SEK 342.3 million. The directed share issue diluted existing shareholders by around 10%. However, if all convertible shares from Tranche 7 are converted, it could cause an additional dilution of around 14%. The company plans to use the funds for its Bitcoin treasury strategy. The funding comes after H100 secured a $15.82 million convertible loan guarantee from Blockstream CEO Adam Beck to help accelerate its planned Bitcoin acquisitions. This followed a $2.2 million raise in May, also led by Beck. Other investors in this round included Crafoord Capital Partners and Morten Klein. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is up almost 1% during the ongoing session as buyers eye a move past $110,000. The flagship cryptocurrency ended the weekend positively, rising nearly 1% on Sunday to settle at $109,231. Despite the positive close to the weekend, BTC lost momentum on Monday, dropping 0.88% and settling at $108,273. It fell to a low of $107,446 on Tuesday but rebounded, rising 0.61% to reclaim $108,000 and settle at $108,938 before reclaiming $109,000 during the ongoing session. With momentum building, traders are optimistic about a move to $110,000. However, blockchain analytics platform Santiment has warned that optimism isn’t always a positive sign. Santiment analyst Brian Quinlivan stated, “It’s pretty clear that the crowd is starting to salivate over a potential $110K+ Bitcoin market value.” Santiment analyzed social media chatter about Bitcoin and found that for every bearish comment for the flagship cryptocurrency, there were 1.51 bullish comments. Santiment based its findings on data from several platforms, including X, Reddit, 4chan, Telegram, BitcoinTalk, and Farcaster. The analytics platform cautioned that similar optimism was followed by substantial declines on two previous occasions. “As we know, prices move in the opposite direction of the crowd’s expectations as retail perpetually loses money from overly emotional decisions.” Santiment believes BTC will experience a pullback before breaking through its all-time high of $111,970, set on May 22. Santiment analysts also highlighted that Bitcoin whale wallets have shown little activity in recent sessions, indicating caution. “For now, these wallets have been somewhat suspiciously flat. When they accumulate, prices often follow closely. When they dump or even just temporarily stop accumulating, it often signals that market values across crypto may see some declines.” BTC ended the previous weekend on a bullish note, rising nearly 1% to close at $108,350. Despite the positive weekend, it lost momentum on Monday, dropping 1.09% to $107,168. Selling pressure intensified on Tuesday as BTC fell 1.33%, slipping below $106,000 and settling at $105,740. Despite the selling pressure, the price recovered on Wednesday, rising nearly 3% to $108,845. Buyers retained control on Thursday as the price reached an intraday high of $110,583 before settling at $109,650, ultimately registering a 0.74% increase. Price action was back in bearish territory on Friday, dropping 1.42% to $108,097. Source: TradingView BTC recovered over the weekend, registering a marginal increase on Saturday and rising nearly 1% on Sunday to cross $109,000 and settle at $109,231. Despite the positive weekend, BTC lost momentum on Monday, dropping almost 1% to $108,273, but not before falling to a low of $108,273. BRC recovered on Tuesday, rising 0.61% to $108,938.
