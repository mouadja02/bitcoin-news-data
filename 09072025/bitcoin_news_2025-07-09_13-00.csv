2025-07-09T10:49:45,"Tether’s Bold Play: Aiming to Become the World’s Largest Bitcoin Miner This Year","Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino revealed that the company is on track to become “probably the biggest miner in the world” by the end of 2025. Ardoino acknowledged that, in most cases, direct BTC investment yields higher profits than mining, but emphasized Tether’s strategic choice to participate in mining to protect its treasury and support Bitcoin’s network security. Bitcoin Mining Supremacy In a recent interview with Bankless, Ardoino explained that the stablecoin issuer already holds significant Bitcoin reserves and therefore has an incentive to contribute to the network’s decentralization through mining operations across South America, the United States, and other regions. Ardoino highlighted the importance of maintaining a mining presence in the US during what he described as a “monumental time” for the industry. On profitability, the exec noted that while block rewards will eventually drop to zero, on-chain fees are expected to rise significantly, which will turn the Bitcoin main chain into a settlement layer for Lightning channels and major contracts. He suggested that these contracts would underpin an “enormous amount” of transactions. In line with Tether’s broader efforts to promote decentralization, it announced plans to open-source its Bitcoin Mining OS (MOS) last month to help new miners enter the market without costly vendor reliance. Ardoino had then described MOS as scalable, modular, and built on peer-to-peer IoT architecture, which is designed to support existing mining infrastructure like containers and power devices. The rollout is expected by the fourth quarter of 2025. The exec said this move would help more companies to compete in securing the Bitcoin network. Earlier, the company partnered with Ocean mining pool to decentralize block building by committing its current and future hash rate to the protocol. Tether’s Gold Reserves Alongside its aggressive mining ambitions, Tether has been quietly expanding its reserve strategy beyond Bitcoin. In fact, Ardoino recently revealed that the firm holds approximately $8 billion in gold, which is around 80 tonnes, in a Swiss vault he described as “the most secure vault in the world.” The exec added that Tether owns nearly the entire stockpile, which makes it one of the largest private gold holders globally. Gold now comprises almost 5% of Tether’s $112 billion reserves, on par with UBS’s precious‑metals holdings.

Eric Anziani, President & COO of Crypto.com, noted these integrations will bring real momentum to the digital asset industry by enabling innovative payment solutions. Part of a Wider Digital Push This agreement is just one piece of Dubai’s wider digital finance strategy. Earlier this year, Dubai’s Department of Finance signed an MoU with Crypto.com to accept crypto for government service fees, part of its bid to reach a 90% cashless goal by 2026. Several other sectors have followed suit. Real estate transactions, telecom services, and even fuel purchases at Emarat are now exploring crypto payments, reinforcing the UAE’s reputation for digital-forward financial frameworks. Moreover, the UAE is aiming to become 90% cashless by 2026, expects an $8 billion economic boost from crypto adoption, and is offering zero-tax zones for Web3 startups.

2025-07-09T10:45:31,"The 7 Best Altcoins for Next Bull Run According to Q3 2025 Price Activity","While headlines keep circling the same old names, early adopters are now shifting their focus to altcoins showing real technical strength and traction in Q3 2025. With market activity climbing, price movements are hinting at what could potentially lead the charge when the next full bull run kicks off. From decentralized AI to cross-chain operability, the most promising altcoins are quietly stacking gains and expanding use cases. One such name that has moved aggressively from presale to all-time high is Qubetics , a new entrant already making noise with its cross-chain wallet and robust validator rewards. In this guide, Qubetics is analyzed alongside other top-performing altcoins showing strong signals right now. These eight picks aren’t about hype, they’re backed by rising utility, strategic integrations, and growing community support. Whether it’s Stacks reshaping Bitcoin DeFi or Immutable X bringing Web3 to gaming, this article breaks down the most compelling altcoins right now. This is where the best altcoins for next bull run start to reveal themselves, and where early positions could turn into serious returns. 1. Qubetics (Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet Is Changing the Game) Qubetics is reshaping digital finance with a real utility wallet that doesn’t just hold assets, it connects them. The Qubetics Wallet functions as a non-custodial, multi-chain application, compatible across mobile (iOS/Android) and desktop platforms. It provides virtual Visa and Mastercard debit card support, a cross-chain interface, and tokenized bandwidth incentives. More than just another storage solution, it’s built to empower users through control, privacy, and accessibility. Virtual cards can be created within the wallet to facilitate secure online purchases, while Apple Pay and Google Pay integration allows fast retail usage in the real world. One of the standout real-world examples is the seamless conversion feature embedded in the app. When users transact using $TICS tokens, the wallet instantly converts them into USDT or USDC at the point of sale, ensuring stability for merchants and frictionless crypto-to-fiat commerce for buyers. This real-world transaction support reinforces Qubetics’ long-term viability in a crowded crypto economy, where speed and trust matter. This project isn’t simply building wallets, it’s enabling entire ecosystems to interact across chains without KYC or high fees. That’s one reason it’s now widely seen as one of the best altcoins for next bull run . Qubetics Launch Data Shows High Early Returns and Solid Market Floor Qubetics has not just introduced advanced tools, it has delivered results that are drawing attention from both seasoned crypto traders and new participants. At launch, the token surged from $0.40 to $4.20 within the first hour, marking a 950% spike. Early presale backers who entered at $0.01 saw up to 420x returns, making Qubetics one of the rare cases of early access translating into real, fast-tracked profit. Consider this: a $5,000 allocation at the $0.01 presale rate would’ve secured 500,000 $TICS. At its ATH of $4.20, that stack would have been worth $2.1 million, showing the real impact of early conviction. Over $18.4 million was raised across 28,500+ contributors during the presale, with 517 million tokens distributed. Post-launch, Qubetics registered over $700,000 in trade volume on MEXC within the first 24 hours. Its Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) model strengthens this foundation. Validators earn 30% APY, while delegators with a minimum of 5,000 $TICS earn a share of those rewards, creating a powerful loop of participation and passive earning. With a solid $2 support level and high buy pressure, analysts are already revising their projections upward, suggesting a possible target of $10 to $15 after full mainnet deployment. Why This Coin Made it to This List: Its early performance, real-world interoperability, and passive earning model powered by Delegated Proof of Stake ( DPoS ) make Qubetics one of the best altcoins for next bull run. 2. Stacks (Bringing DeFi to Bitcoin) Stacks continues to gain attention for its push to make Bitcoin programmable. By enabling smart contracts and decentralized apps (dApps) on top of Bitcoin, Stacks unlocks DeFi functionality that Bitcoin natively lacks. Q3 has shown a marked uptick in developer activity, wallet creation, and TVL (total value locked) within the ecosystem, signaling growing adoption. Stacks’ anchor to Bitcoin offers a degree of stability not often seen in other L1 smart contract platforms. The Clarity smart contract language ensures predictability and reduces vulnerabilities, making it an appealing choice for long-term builders. Integration with new Layer 2 solutions also keeps transactions efficient and scalable, essential for user growth. Why This Coin Made it to This List: With DeFi finally arriving on Bitcoin through Stacks, its protocol could see mass usage during a bull cycle, putting it among the best altcoins for next bull run. 3. Arweave (Permanent Storage for On-Chain Data) Arweave isn’t trying to replace existing blockchains, it’s solving the long-term problem of decentralized data storage. It provides permanent storage on-chain, which is already being used by NFT projects, DAOs, and even news publications to secure content forever. Q3 activity reflects new institutional-level interest and integrations, suggesting that its tech is being taken more seriously than ever before. The protocol relies on its unique “blockweave” structure, which allows nodes to store a randomized subset of old blocks, cutting down on redundant storage while still ensuring data availability. As decentralized content networks grow, Arweave’s ability to timestamp and lock content permanently is becoming vital. Why This Coin Made it to This List: Its use case is critical to scaling Web3’s infrastructure, making it a strong contender among the best altcoins for next bull run. 4. Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance (ASIA) Formed by the merger of Fetch.ai, Ocean Protocol, and SingularityNET, the Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance is building a decentralized AI ecosystem that avoids corporate centralization. This coalition is working toward developing a shared intelligence framework that enables private AI agents to exchange value, resources, and logic on-chain. Q3 has seen significant cross-project collaboration and token utility enhancement, including resource pooling and interchain agent protocols. The collaboration also expands the individual networks’ reach, driving more value into the unified ASI token. By integrating machine learning with blockchain transparency, ASIA is addressing issues in both ecosystems. Why This Coin Made it to This List: With AI’s importance growing, a decentralized model like ASIA positions itself at the right intersection of data sovereignty and tech advancement, marking it as one of the best altcoins for next bull run. 5. Immutable X (Scalable NFT Gaming Infrastructure) Immutable X remains a leader in Ethereum Layer 2 scaling for gaming and NFTs. By enabling zero gas fees and near-instant settlement for digital assets, it solves the core issue of congestion and cost on Ethereum’s mainnet. Q3 partnerships with gaming studios and retail brands confirm that real-world adoption is progressing steadily. The project uses StarkWare’s ZK-rollup tech to batch transactions off-chain and publish them on Ethereum without compromising security. The seamless user experience, especially for gamers unfamiliar with gas fees or wallet complexities, gives it a unique foothold. Why This Coin Made it to This List: With blockchain gaming heating up again, Immutable X is ready to capture that volume, placing it among the best altcoins for next bull run. 6. Hedera (Enterprise Grade Blockchain Utility) Hedera Hashgraph is pushing boundaries by offering enterprise-grade solutions with unmatched transaction finality and network throughput. Backed by governing council members including Google and IBM, its native service for tokenization and consensus is already being used by Fortune 500 companies. In Q3 2025, Hedera saw more integration in tokenized real-world asset experiments, driving institutional attention. Its low-energy consensus model also fits well with ESG investment mandates, adding further potential for future institutional alignment. Why This Coin Made it to This List: With real enterprise use cases and unmatched speed, Hedera fits right into the best altcoins for next bull run narrative. 7. Astra (Modular Web3 Ecosystem) Astra is making headlines with its modular architecture that allows projects to plug into various services, such as identity, DeFi rails, and smart contracts, without building from scratch. This plug-and-play design lowers the barrier for Web3 onboarding, particularly for small teams and startups. Q3 has shown consistent network upgrades, deeper SDK adoption, and new DeFi protocols launching on Astra. As the market seeks modular, scalable platforms to replace monolithic chains, Astra’s tech stack positions it well. Why This Coin Made it to This List: Modular architecture is gaining traction, and Astra’s efficiency makes it one of the best altcoins for next bull run. Conclusion: Final Picks for the Best Altcoins for Next Bull Run From Qubetics’ early breakout and advanced wallet features to Stacks’ smart contracts on Bitcoin and Immutable X’s scalable NFT rails, each of these eight altcoins shows serious potential. Qubetics alone combines fast ROI, no-KYC interoperability, and a strong Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) model, making it a standout. Meanwhile, Hedera and ASIA bring in enterprise-grade and decentralized AI innovation, respectively. For those looking to align themselves with technically sound projects, this is where the best altcoins for next bull run are already forming their base. Staying informed now could set up the right moves later.

2025-07-09T10:45:14,"Bitcoin (BTC) ready for takeoff as the dollar loses steam","BTC traders often track the DXY metric because of the correlation between the dollar’s dominance and Bitcoin’s pump and dump cycles. Right now, the DXY has sunk to a historically weak level, trading 6.5 points below its 200-day moving average, marking the largest deviation in the past 21 years. Meanwhile, U.S. debt has also reached new all-time highs. Both occurrences are concerning, but crypto enthusiasts may not feel too concerned about the falling DXY as it actually tends to benefit risk assets like Bitcoin. BTC bulls hope the falling DXY benefits Bitcoin as it has historically done. Source: CryptoQuant The dollar’s weakness historically gives BTC an edge When the dollar weakens , losing its safe-haven appeal, investors are forced to reassess their portfolio and allocate capital toward alternative asset classes like BTC. Historical data shows that periods like this, where the DXY showed great weakness, have been highly favorable to BTC. Good examples of times when this happened include 2021 and 2023, when there were significant DXY drops that coincided with BTC rallies. As it stands, analysts believe the market is setting up for the weakness of the DXY to potentially fuel a new BTC price rally. That opportunity is made even more enticing thanks to current monetary policy expectations including rate cuts, rising global M2 money supply and an increased demand for high-yield corporate bonds. The impact of the DXY’s weakness on BTC’s price has yet to reflect It is true the dollar is significantly weakened currently, but unlike in the past, its effect on Bitcoin’s price action seems subdued as the leading crypto is currently more than 2% lower than its all-time high of $111,814. This hesitation on Bitcoin’s end to behave as it would historically have during periods of dollar weakness can be linked to technical factors like the strong resistance level at the $110,000 – $112,000 range. Another potential reason is the sidelined liquidity. Yes, Bitcoin has finally secured a foothold in the corridors of power. However, many investors are still sidelined due to macroeconomic factors and analysts are convinced it contributes to BTC’s delayed response to the DXY’s weakness. Despite this, traders remain bullish on BTC’s potential. The DXY’s current significant deviation below its 200-day moving average is a powerful indicator of early bull phases for BTC, not just because of the technical triggers, but because it signals pending liquidity flow into the crypto markets. Overall activity on the Bitcoin network has also reduced and continues to do so as more investors go into HODL mode after previous rounds of profit taking. The institutional race to stockpile Bitcoin has also caused the percentage of coins left unmoved for over a year to increase from 61.7% to 63.61% by April 2025. If the DXY does not recover, it increases the potential of Bitcoin trending higher as retail investors who faded into the woodwork when institutions started buying heavily may emerge again.

2025-07-09T10:40:13,"Why Is Crypto Up Today? – July 9, 2025","The crypto market is up today. The majority of the top 100 coins per market cap have appreciated over the past 24 hours. At the same time, the cryptocurrency market capitalization has fallen 2.5% to $3.44 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $82.5 billion, one of the lowest levels we’ve seen over the past few days. TLDR: The crypto market turned upwards, with 95 of 100 coins going green; BTC is unchanged, trading at $108,322, while ETH saw the highest increase in the top 10 category; The prices and the sentiment continue moving sideways, awaiting further signals; The Dollar Index (DXY) has hit a historically weak, with BTC benefiting; US BTC and ETH ETFs continue positive, albeit minor flows; ETFs will continue to attract “significant investment from institutions and retail investors”; Investors are assessing the global trade and tariffs-related developments in the US. Crypto Winners & Losers In another shift from green to red and back to green, the prices of nearly all top 10 coins per market cap have appreciated today. Bitcoin (BTC) is up 0.4%, the same amount it had dropped this time yesterday, meaning it’s unchanged, currently trading at $108,812. At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) appreciated by 3.1%, currently changing hands at $2,629. This is the highest increase in this category. The second-highest rise is XRP (XRP)’s 3% to the price of $2.33. Tron (TRX) is the only coin red coin, but its price is unchanged over the past day. It currently stands at $0.2869. Looking at the top 100 coins, we find that 95 of them are up at the time of writing. Two of these recorded double-digit increases. Cronos (CRO) and SPX6900 (SPX) are up 16.4% and 12.5% to $0.09335 and $1.4, respectively. On the other hand, Bonk (BONK) and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) fell the most in this category. They’re down 6.3% and 2% to the prices of $0.0000218 and $1.06, respectively. The markets are largely waiting for additional signals, deciding where to move. Financial markets overall, but stocks more so than crypto, are keeping a close look on even the most minute developments in the US related to tariffs and trade. Meanwhile, South Korea has moved to reclassify crypto trading and brokerage firms as “venture companies.” This would provide these companies with access to government subsidies, tax incentives, and financial support. The Ministry of SMEs and Startups issued a notice on Monday and proposed an amendment to its startup law to include Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) in the venture company category.

The latter currently trades 6.5 points below its 200-day moving average. This is the largest deviation in the past 21 years, the analysts says. “Although this may appear alarming at first glance, it actually tends to benefit risk assets like Bitcoin,” they add. The dollar weakens and loses its safe-haven appeal, leading investors to “reassess their portfolio allocations and shift capital toward alternative asset classes.” Weak Dollar, Strong Bitcoin: A Time-Tested Correlation “This chart highlights periods where the DXY trades below its 365-day moving average. Looking at historical data, it becomes clear that such periods have been highly favorable to BTC.” – By @Darkfost_Coc pic.twitter.com/viwbcfNhdM — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) July 9, 2025 Moreover, Andrejs Balans, Risk Manager at YouHodler , commented on the impact of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on the crypto market. “A big win for the crypto community came” when the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first spot ETF. At first, the market responded with caution, with both BTC and ETH dipping slightly. However, many analysts expect the ETFs will continue to attract “significant investment from institutions and retail investors who want a straightforward way to participate in crypto without managing wallets or private keys,” Balans says. “The fund could help increase liquidity and reduce price swings over time by making crypto exposure more accessible.” ETF and Strategy Bitcoin purchases heatmap.

Last day’s trading was quite choppy. However, the price did not go below the $108,000 level. The lowest it dropped to is $108,198. Also, the intraday high is $109,090. Investors are waiting to see if the coin will surpass and hold the $109,000 level. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView Moreover, Ethereum is currently trading at $2,629. It started the day with the daily low of $2,456. At one point, it surged to $2,622, then to the current level as its intraday high. Over the next day, ETH may move above $2,635. Contrarily, it may fall below $2,500 should the market turn red abruptly. Also, the crypto market sentiment is largely unchanged. It has been moving between 49 and 55 over the week. The Fear and Greed Index is up from 50 and back to the level seen two days ago, standing at 52 today . Both the sentiment and the prices keep moving sideways, awaiting further signals. Source: CoinMarketCap Meanwhile, on 8 July, the US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded inflows of $80.08 million , significantly lower than the $216.64 million seen on 7 July. BlackRock leads the list with inflows of $66.81 million. Fidelity , Bitwise , and Valkyrie also saw minor positive flows.

2025-07-09T10:38:17,"Hyperbitcoinization Begins? Why Corporations Are Racing to Drain Bitcoin Supply","The post Hyperbitcoinization Begins? Why Corporations Are Racing to Drain Bitcoin Supply appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Could corporations trigger the end of fiat currency? Crypto analyst Adam Livingston thinks so, and he’s not alone. In a bold prediction, Livingston warns that the corporate rush to accumulate Bitcoin is creating a massive demand shock. The supply squeeze could soon push BTC into uncharted territory and force a dramatic shift in global finance. Corporations Are Stacking Bitcoin Faster Than Ever According to Livingston, public companies now hold over 858,850 BTC, worth more than $93 billion , about 4.09% of the total Bitcoin supply . “Most of the newly mined Bitcoin is now going straight to corporate treasuries,” Livingston stated on X . This surge is being led by giants like MicroStrategy, which owns around 597,325 BTC (over $64.9 billion). The company’s strategy is clear: Issue more shares Use the funds to buy BTC Increase BTC-per-share Boost stock value Repeat the cycle Livingston calls this a “Bitcoin flywheel,” a feedback loop that turns stock dilution into Bitcoin accumulation, undermining fiat currencies in the process. Bitcoin Mining Supply Is Shrinking, Fast Miners are no longer selling their rewards. The current BTC block reward stands at 3.125 BTC, and it’s set to halve again in 2028. This means: New supply is slowing Corporate demand is accelerating Bitcoin scarcity is intensifying Livingston emphasizes that this imbalance is unsustainable, and a massive price breakout is inevitable. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin to $1 Million in Months? Samson Mow Reveals Shocking Scenario , Bitcoin Reserves on Exchanges Hit Record Low CryptoQuant data shows that the total Bitcoin reserves across exchanges are now at just 2.4 million BTC. At the current buying pace, Livingston warns, “This entire reserve could be depleted within months.” With CFOs treating BTC as a strategic reserve asset, demand from institutions may soon leave retail investors sidelined. The Final Phase: Hyperbitcoinization? Livingston’s forecast goes beyond a simple bull market. He believes this is the early stage of hyperbitcoinization a financial revolution where Bitcoin becomes the preferred store of value over fiat.As regulations legitimize BTC as a treasury asset, more companies will jump in. Once that phase is over, the “early adopter” window will close forever. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

SHIB’s community is still huge, but newer traders want more than jokes. They want tokens linked to services they actually use. The crypto market has matured since the meme boom. Users now expect instant transfers, clear fees and apps that feel like normal banking. Coins that solve practical problems think stablecoin settlements or on-chain gaming have stolen attention from pure memes. That shift sets the stage for Remittix, which aims to turn crypto into bank cash in seconds. Remittix: Turning Phones into Global ATMs Remittix’s upcoming PayFi wallet is different from typical wallets. Imagine a worker in Manila who gets paid in Bitcoin on Friday and needs pesos by Saturday morning. With PayFi she scans a QR code, taps “cash out” and pesos land in her local bank before her coffee is cold. Behind the scenes, the app chooses the cheapest corridor, handles foreign-exchange and sends the payout with no exchanges, no off-chain wait. What makes RTX stand out is recurring demand. Every paycheck, gig payment or family remittance that flows through PayFi requires a small amount of RTX for network fees. Those fees aren’t recycled; they are locked in a treasury burn schedule that permanently reduces circulating supply at the end of each month. Less supply plus rising usage is a math equation even an eighth-grader can spot. Why Analysts Call RTX the Next Wealth Engine Shiba Inu showed that affordable tokens can mint fortunes but its fate rested on memes. Remittix offers a similar low price with a real-world pipeline that taps the $190 trillion global payments market. If PayFi rolls out smoothly in Q4 and users flock to its cheap, instant cash-outs, recurring fee demand could push RTX supply ever lower and prices far higher by 2025. Shiba Inu wrote the story of 2021’s meme mania. Remittix hopes to script 2025’s tale of utility-driven growth. With a product people can actually use, a shrinking supply model and a final funding sprint almost complete, RTX might be the token that turns today’s spare change into tomorrow’s headline wealth.

2025-07-09T10:30:54,"Ethereum Bullish Signal: Whales Scoop Up 200,000 ETH","On-chain data shows the Ethereum whales have participated in some notable buying, a sign that could be bullish for the ETH price. Ethereum Whales Have Added To Their Holdings As explained by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, the supply of the Ethereum whales has recently gone up. The on-chain metric of interest here is the “ Supply Distribution ” from the analytics firm Santiment, which tells us about the total amount of an asset that a given wallet group is holding right now. Addresses or investors are divided into these cohorts based on the number of coins that they are carrying in their balance. The 1 to 10 coins cohort, for instance, contains all the holders owning between 1 and 10 ETH. In the context of the current topic, the whale group is of focus. The range of this cohort is typically defined as 10,000 to 100,000 ETH. At the current exchange rate, the lower bound converts to $26.2 million and the upper one to $262 million. Thus, the only investors who would qualify for the group would be the big-money ones. Such holders can carry some degree of influence in the market, so their behavior, represented by the trend in their Supply Distribution, can be worth monitoring. Here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the trend in the Supply Distribution of the Ethereum whales over the last couple of weeks: As is visible in the above graph, the Ethereum Supply Distribution for the 10,000 to 100,000 coins investors has recently seen an increase, implying these holders have participated in net accumulation. In total, the whales have added 200,000 ETH (worth around $524 million) to their holdings with this buying spree. This is a significant amount and suggests some large holders think the cryptocurrency is worth buying at the current price. It only remains to be seen, however, whether this bet would pay off for these investors. In some other news, there is a strong accumulation zone for Ethereum around the $2,500 level, as the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has pointed out in an X post . The above chart shows the data for the Ethereum Cost Basis Distribution Heatmap, an indicator that tells us how much of the asset’s supply was last purchased at what price levels. “ETH’s Cost Basis Distribution Heatmap shows ~$2.5K as one of the strongest accumulation zones in months,” notes Glassnode. “Over 3.45M $ETH has a cost basis in the $2,513–$2,536 range, reinforcing this level as a major support zone.” ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $2,600, up 3% in the last 24 hours.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-bullish-signal-whales-scoop-up-200000-eth/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","Ethereum|ETH|Ethereum Bullish|Ethereum Buying|Ethereum Whales|ETHUSDT",cryptocompare

2025-07-09T10:27:49,"Early Bitcoin Buyer Says Dismissing XRP Today Is a Mistake","Pro-XRP game developer Chad Steingraber recently reignited confidence in XRP with a post highlighting his early Bitcoin investment. According to Steingraber, he bought all his Bitcoin when it was just $3,000, a decision that has paid off massively.Notably, BTC last sold for exactly $3,000 in December 2018. The leading crypto also maintained prices in the $3K range in early 2019 before it left that region for good.In the nearly seven years that followed, Bitcoin has gone on to reach its peak price of $112,000. In perspective, that marks a massive 3,633% surge. Even today, it retains most of those gains, stabilizing around $109K.Don’t Miss XRP After Missing BitcoinIn his post, Steingraber emphasized that he would have missed the opportunity to enter Bitcoin early and net a 37X return if he had listened to the naysayers. He suggests that XRP is now in a similar phase. The tweet subtly warns that listening to skeptics could lead to missing out again.Steingraber’s message resonates with a broader sentiment within the XRP community. They believe XRP could become as valuable as Bitcoin in the future and that long-term value often emerges when sentiment is at its lowest.These comparisons surface as XRP’s long-term performance continues to frustrate holders. The coin has traded below its peak for nearly eight years, with many critics labeling it a poor long-term investment but viable for short-term speculation.Ignoring the Noise, Focusing on ValueHowever, XRP proponents see such skepticism as similar to what Bitcoin faced in its early stages. Some commentators also point out that XRP has existed nearly as long as Bitcoin.Notably, XRP emerged three years after Bitcoin, though their performance remains miles apart. For instance, around 2018/2019, when Bitcoin was last seen at $3K and Steingraber entered, XRP was around $0.28. Since then, XRP’s price has increased about 11X compared to Bitcoin’s 37X.Many attribute XRP’s perceived underperformance to the SEC lawsuit . While the legal battles are now behind it, the coin has yet to stage the historic breakout many hope will make them rich.Yet, amid the wait, pundits continue to highlight that a day of reckoning is coming for XRP, and those ignoring it today may regret it. According to crypto educator Edoardo Farina, investors have until Ripple unveils a new plan for the XRP in escrow. After that, he believes FOMO will send the price through the roof.Separately, influencer Coach JV said XRP holders stand to benefit from one of the greatest wealth transfers in history. According to him, those sleeping on XRP will regret it in the future.But When?Amid all these promises of a bright future, the lingering question on investors' minds is: When will this teased future arrive? Early Bitcoin holders are already cashing out billions from investments made when prices were under $0.10. As for XRP holders, the wait continues. However, pundits like Steingraber have continued to advise patience.https://twitter.com/JDin5D/status/1942040888881934643",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/07/09/early-bitcoin-buyer-says-dismissing-xrp-today-is-a-mistake/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=early-bitcoin-buyer-says-dismissing-xrp-today-is-a-mistake,"XRP|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS","Market|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today",cryptocompare
2025-07-09T10:27:10,"Altcoin Season Could Begin in October, 3 Signals You Shouldn’t Ignore","The post Altcoin Season Could Begin in October, 3 Signals You Shouldn’t Ignore appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News It’s been a brutal cycle for altcoins. Bitcoin has taken center stage , dominating the narrative and capital flows, while altcoin holders continue to watch their portfolios stagnate, or worse, bleed. While Bitcoin continues to surge and is sticking above $100k, altcoins have only seen two brief rallies in March and November 2024. But according to crypto analyst Crypto Decoder , several under-the-radar signals now suggest that a broader alt season could be setting up, even if it’s not here just yet. Altseason is delayed this cycle. Only a handful of alts pump while the rest keep bleeding against Bitcoin. Just dropped a new video breaking down the key macro indicators to watch for a reversal, and when our alt bags might finally pump. Watch here https://t.co/zBLsBNt9lq pic.twitter.com/2sI8wWrHHa — Crypto Decoder (@Cryptodecoder0x) July 8, 2025 Dollar Weakness Could Set the Stage One of the most important signs comes from the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY). Crypto Decoder highlights that when the dollar weakens, altcoins often gain massive momentum. In 2017, a sharp drop in the DXY led to a 285x explosion in altcoin market cap. In 2021, a similar move sparked a 17x rally. This pattern ties closely to U.S. monetary policy, when the Federal Reserve loosens financial conditions and borrowing gets easier, investors typically move into riskier assets. Bitcoin is usually the first stop, followed by altcoins. Right now, the DXY is showing signs of fading strength and has failed to break above the 109 mark. If it falls below key support levels, it could trigger renewed interest in altcoins. Still, Decoder cautions that a real shift in Fed policy will likely be needed before we see any explosive price action. Check out This Hidden Macro Indicator Another strong but lesser-known signal is the copper-to-gold ratio. This metric reflects investor sentiment. When copper outperforms gold, it suggests a growing risk appetite in the market. According to the analyst, the ratio has just bounced from multi-year lows and climbed above its 20-week EMA , an early signal that conditions are becoming favorable for altcoins, much like what happened before the 2017 and 2020 rallies. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Firms in South Korea Set to Finally Gain Legal Status, Tax Incentives , Ethereum Leads the Way ETH outperformed BTC last quarter, first time since Q4 2022. With institutional flows finally coming in, ETH is showing real strength against Bitcoin after years of bleeding out. Remember, ETH doing well is good news for our bags. Not ready to comment on SEASONality just yet. pic.twitter.com/baaFFulWnl — Crypto Decoder (@Cryptodecoder0x) July 6, 2025 Ethereum’s recent performance also adds to the bullish case. ETH has started outperforming Bitcoin for the first time since late 2022. This comeback, powered by over $2 billion in ETF inflows since May 2025, hints at growing institutional interest. Since ETH holds over 50% of DeFi TVL and drives liquidity for altcoins, its strength often leads to broader altcoin gains. Altcoin Season Could Heat Up in Q4 Although August and September may bring more sideways action, analyst believes the real opportunity may arrive in Q4. If the Fed cuts rates in September, and macro signals hold up, October could mirror past post-halving rallies. Supporting this view, analyst Michaël van de Poppe notes that the Altcoin Season Index has once again bottomed in June, just like it did before previous major alt rallies. With the bull cycle in motion and easing expected, he sees potential for a much bigger altcoin surge by Q4, like it happened in 2023. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

According to a July 9 post on X by analyst Ali, Solana has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern on the 4-hour chart, characterized by two converging trendlines representing lower highs and higher lows. Such a pattern suggests a period of price consolidation that typically culminates in a breakout in either direction. Ali noted that a confirmed breakout above the upper boundary of the pattern, located near the $153 resistance level, could trigger a bullish move with a short-term target of $164. SOL price, MACD and RSI chart — July 9 | Source: crypto.news As of press time, Solana ( SOL ) was trading exactly at this key threshold, setting the stage for a potential technical breakout. Momentum indicators support the bullish outlook. On the 4-hour/USDT chart, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence line has crossed above the signal line, with both trending upward. Traders view this as a sign that buying interest is picking up, and the price may continue to rise. Additional technical insights were provided by another pseudonymous analyst, SDX, who observed that SOL has been coiling below a descending trendline formed since the beginning of the year. A successful breakout and retest of this level, SDX notes, could act as a catalyst for a stronger uptrend, potentially opening the door to a new all-time high if buying volume confirms the breakout.

First, SOL was recently included as one of the featured assets in Trump Media and Technology Group’s proposed “blue-chip” cryptocurrency ETF, according to a filing with the U.S. SEC. Second, reports indicate that the U.S. SEC has requested issuers to amend and resubmit applications for spot Solana ETFs by the end of July, potentially accelerating the timeline for formal approval. When the SEC makes such a request, it typically signals that the agency is not rejecting the proposals outright but is open to moving forward if certain conditions are met. Traders often view this kind of regulatory engagement as a bullish sign, interpreting it as a step closer to approval that could unlock fresh demand from institutions and retail investors alike. Meanwhile, Solana has also emerged as a leading blockchain in the real-world asset tokenization sector. Data from Dune Analytics shows that tokenized RWAs on Solana reached a record $418 million, with a 631% increase in active users over the past 30 days. This is further backed by strong network activity. Daily active addresses for Solana shot up to 15.39 million from just 3.46 million the previous day, marking a dramatic 345% increase in network activity. Source: Santiment Stablecoin supply on the Solana network has also steadily increased over the past week. Stablecoins are the backbone of decentralized finance, serving as a critical medium of exchange, store of value, and unit of account within blockchain ecosystems. For Solana, this could mean an influx of new users is leveraging the chain for payments, trading, and tokenized asset settlements, which in turn can further support the bullish narrative. SOL was trading roughly 48% below its all-time high of $293 at press time.

2025-07-09T10:20:54,"Bitcoin Market Cap: South Korea’s Stock Market Stages Stunning Comeback","Are you closely watching the ebb and flow of digital assets versus traditional finance? The world of finance just witnessed a significant shift that has many investors talking. For a period, Bitcoin, the world’s leading cryptocurrency, held a commanding lead in total market capitalization over an entire nation’s stock market. However, a recent report indicates a stunning reversal: the Bitcoin market cap has been edged out by the combined might of South Korea’s KOSPI and KOSDAQ stock exchanges. What’s Happening in the South Korea Stock Market ? In a development that highlights the dynamic nature of global finance, South Korea’s traditional equity markets have successfully reclaimed their position ahead of Bitcoin in terms of total market capitalization. According to Herald Business, as of July 8, the aggregate market cap of the KOSPI and KOSDAQ stood at an impressive 2.96 quadrillion won (approximately $2.16 trillion). This figure marginally surpassed Bitcoin’s 2.95 quadrillion won (around $2.15 trillion) for the first time since November of last year, when Bitcoin initially surged ahead. This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it signifies a broader narrative about investor sentiment, economic performance, and the ongoing dance between established financial systems and emerging digital assets. The South Korea stock market has shown resilience and growth, driven by various factors we’ll explore, ultimately leading to this significant overtake. Key Market Capitalization Comparison (as of July 8) Asset/Market Total Market Cap (KRW) Total Market Cap (USD) South Korea Stock Market (KOSPI + KOSDAQ) 2.96 Quadrillion Won $2.16 Trillion Bitcoin 2.95 Quadrillion Won $2.15 Trillion The Evolving Landscape of Bitcoin Market Cap Bitcoin’s journey has been nothing short of a rollercoaster. From its humble beginnings to becoming a trillion-dollar asset, its market capitalization has been a key indicator of its adoption and investor confidence. The fact that its Bitcoin market cap could, for a time, exceed the entire stock market of a developed nation like South Korea speaks volumes about the disruptive potential of cryptocurrency. However, Bitcoin’s value is highly volatile, influenced by: Macroeconomic Factors: Interest rate changes, inflation concerns, and global economic stability directly impact risk-on assets like Bitcoin. Regulatory Developments: News of new regulations, bans, or approvals in major economies can cause significant price swings. Institutional Adoption: Increased interest from large financial institutions and corporations often boosts Bitcoin’s legitimacy and price. Market Sentiment: FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) or FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) can quickly shift the collective mood of crypto investors. The recent dip in Bitcoin’s market cap, while slight in this comparison, reflects the ongoing challenges and consolidation phases the cryptocurrency market often experiences after periods of rapid growth. Understanding the Dynamics of KOSPI KOSDAQ Performance South Korea’s two main stock exchanges, KOSPI (Korea Composite Stock Price Index) and KOSDAQ (Korean Securities Dealers Automated Quotations), represent the backbone of the nation’s economy. KOSPI typically lists larger, more established companies, while KOSDAQ focuses on tech, biotech, and smaller growth-oriented firms. Their combined performance is a strong indicator of South Korea’s economic health and investor confidence in its corporate sector. What might have fueled the recent surge in KOSPI KOSDAQ market capitalization? Strong Corporate Earnings: Many South Korean companies, particularly in the tech and automotive sectors, have reported robust earnings, attracting investor interest. Government Support: Policies aimed at boosting domestic consumption and investment can provide tailwinds for the stock market. Global Economic Recovery Hopes: Optimism about a global economic rebound can lead to increased foreign investment in emerging markets like South Korea. Shift from Risk Assets: Some investors might be reallocating funds from higher-risk assets like cryptocurrencies back into more traditional, albeit still growth-oriented, equities. The resilience and growth demonstrated by KOSPI KOSDAQ highlight the enduring strength of established equity markets, even in an era of digital disruption. Implications for Global Financial Markets This market cap shift in South Korea isn’t just a local story; it carries broader implications for global financial markets . It serves as a reminder that while cryptocurrencies have carved out a significant niche, traditional markets remain formidable forces with deep liquidity and established regulatory frameworks. Here are some key takeaways for global investors and market watchers: Diversification Remains Key: The event underscores the importance of a diversified investment portfolio that balances traditional assets with emerging ones. Interconnectedness: The performance of one asset class can influence sentiment and capital flows in others, demonstrating the interconnectedness of global financial systems. Regulatory Impact: The stability and predictability offered by regulated stock exchanges continue to be attractive, especially during periods of uncertainty in less regulated spaces. Economic Fundamentals Matter: The underlying economic strength and corporate performance of a nation can ultimately dictate the trajectory of its financial markets. As central banks worldwide navigate inflation and economic growth, the performance of both traditional equities and digital assets will continue to offer crucial insights into investor behavior and the future direction of capital. Navigating Current Crypto Market Trends While South Korea’s stock market has temporarily taken the lead, this does not diminish the long-term potential or significance of Bitcoin and the broader crypto ecosystem. Instead, it offers a moment for reflection on current crypto market trends and what they mean for investors. The cryptocurrency market is maturing, experiencing cycles of boom and bust, and constantly evolving with new technologies and use cases. What does this specific market cap shift suggest for crypto enthusiasts? Volatility is Inherent: Expect continued price fluctuations. Bitcoin’s journey will not be a straight line up. Long-Term Vision: For many, Bitcoin is a long-term investment, a hedge against inflation, or a foundational technology for a new financial paradigm. Short-term market cap comparisons, while interesting, don’t always capture this long-term view. Innovation Continues: Beyond Bitcoin, the crypto space is teeming with innovation in DeFi, NFTs, Web3, and more, which will drive future growth. Regulatory Scrutiny: As crypto gains mainstream attention, increased regulatory oversight is inevitable, which could bring both challenges and opportunities for stability and wider adoption. Investors should remain informed, exercise caution, and understand that the crypto market operates on different fundamentals than traditional stock exchanges. Conclusion: A Shifting Financial Landscape The news that South Korea’s KOSPI and KOSDAQ have collectively surpassed Bitcoin’s market capitalization is a compelling headline that underscores the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of global finance. It highlights the enduring strength of traditional stock markets, particularly in robust economies like South Korea, while also reminding us of the inherent volatility and evolving narrative of digital assets. This isn’t necessarily a ‘win’ for one side over the other, but rather a snapshot of a moment in time, illustrating the continuous interplay between established financial systems and the disruptive forces of cryptocurrency. For investors, it reinforces the timeless principles of diversification, informed decision-making, and adapting to ever-changing market conditions. Whether you’re bullish on equities or believe in the digital revolution, understanding these shifts is crucial for navigating the complex world of finance.

The gold stockpile is kept in a vault in Switzerland in an undisclosed location for security reasons. According to a recent report by Bloomberg, Chief Executive Paolo Ardoino said that the pile of gold is worth $8 billion. He claimed that the gold is kept in a facility that is the most “most secure vault in the world.” Although, the company would not reveal its location for security reasons. Ardoino also declined to disclose when the vault was establish. The only detail he unveiled was that the vault is based somewhere in Switzerland . At the moment, the USDT ( USDT ) stablecoin issuer Tether holds nearly 80 tons of gold, with most of it being owned directly by the company. The amount is almost equal to the total value of metals and other commodities held by UBS Group. This large stockpile makes Tether one of the largest gold holders in the world outside of banks and nation states. You might also like: Gold hits new ATH at $3,390, is Bitcoin close behind? Ardoino acknowledged the rise in safe haven assets especially gold compared to fiat currency in his interview with Bloomberg. He said the decision to have their own vault instead of paying vault operators was driven by the rising cost of the asset. “Gold, I think should be logically a safer asset than any national currency. So eventually, I think that if people start to get concerned about the potential increase of the debt of United States, they might look at alternatives,” said Ardoino. According to the data from Trading Economics, gold has rallied as much as 38.5% in the past year. It also reached a new all-time high at $3,390 on April 21. At press time, it sits at a value of $3,289. Gold is often used as a hedge by investors against inflation, much like how Bitcoin ( BTC ) is viewed the same way. “Every single central bank in the BRICS countries is buying gold, so that is why gold price went up in our opinion,” he said. Earlier in April, the stablecoin giant issued 7.7 tons of physical gold to back its digital asset Tether Gold or XAUT ( XAUT ), which currently holds pure gold as a reserve backing on a 1:1 ratio. At press time, XAUT’s market cap stands at more than $811 million.

2025-07-09T10:10:51,"Bitcoin ETFs See Remarkable $80M Inflows: A New Era of Institutional Crypto Investment Begins","The world of cryptocurrency is buzzing with exciting news! On July 8, US Spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced a significant surge, recording a total net inflow of $80.08 million. This marks a pivotal moment, extending the streak of positive flows for the fourth consecutive trading day. For anyone following the evolution of digital assets, this consistent influx of capital into Bitcoin Inflows through regulated investment vehicles signals a growing confidence and appetite from the traditional financial sector. What’s Driving the Latest Bitcoin Inflows? This impressive performance isn’t just a fleeting moment; it’s a testament to the increasing comfort and strategic positioning of institutional investors within the crypto space. The continuous positive inflows highlight a shifting narrative around Bitcoin, moving it further into the mainstream financial landscape. But what exactly does this mean for the broader market, and why are we seeing such sustained interest? The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year opened the floodgates for a new wave of investors who previously might have been hesitant to directly hold cryptocurrencies. These ETFs offer a regulated, accessible, and often more palatable way for institutions and retail investors alike to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of direct ownership, such as managing private keys or navigating crypto exchanges. Key Players Leading the Charge in US Spot Bitcoin ETFs While the overall net inflow figure is compelling, a closer look reveals which players are truly dominating this new wave of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption . BlackRock’s IBIT continues to be a powerhouse, consistently attracting the lion’s share of new capital. This isn’t surprising, given BlackRock’s immense reach and reputation in traditional finance. Here’s a snapshot of the individual ETF performances on July 8: ETF Ticker Issuer Net Inflows (July 8) IBIT BlackRock $66.82 million BTC Grayscale (mini) $4.82 million FBTC Fidelity $4.75 million BRRR Valkyrie $3.69 million Others Various No Change As evident from the table, BlackRock’s IBIT is not just leading; it’s significantly outperforming its peers in terms of attracting new capital. This dominance suggests that large institutional investors are comfortable placing their trust and funds with established financial giants, even when venturing into the relatively newer asset class of Bitcoin. How Do These Inflows Impact Crypto Market Trends? The consistent positive flows into spot Bitcoin ETFs have several profound implications for the broader Crypto Market Trends and the future trajectory of Bitcoin: Increased Liquidity and Stability: As more capital flows into these ETFs, it enhances the overall liquidity of the Bitcoin market. Greater liquidity can lead to reduced price volatility, making Bitcoin a more attractive asset for a wider range of investors. Validation of Bitcoin: The sustained institutional interest acts as a powerful validation for Bitcoin as a legitimate and viable asset class. This can encourage more traditional financial entities to explore digital assets, further bridging the gap between old and new finance. Potential for Price Appreciation: While not a direct cause-and-effect relationship, consistent buying pressure from ETFs can contribute to Bitcoin’s price appreciation. As demand outstrips supply, especially with Bitcoin’s capped supply, the price tends to rise. Broader Accessibility: The success of these ETFs demonstrates the immense demand for accessible Bitcoin investment products. This could pave the way for more innovative crypto-related financial products in the future, catering to diverse investor needs. It’s important to remember that while inflows are a positive sign, the crypto market remains dynamic and subject to various global macroeconomic factors, regulatory developments, and technological advancements. However, the current trend paints a hopeful picture for Bitcoin’s journey towards wider adoption. What’s Next for Institutional Bitcoin Adoption? The momentum seen in US Spot Bitcoin ETFs is likely to continue, especially as more financial advisors and wealth managers become educated about these products and integrate them into client portfolios. We could see: Increased Competition: As the market matures, expect more innovation and competition among ETF providers, potentially leading to lower fees and more diversified offerings. Global Expansion: The success of US ETFs could inspire similar product launches in other major financial jurisdictions, further globalizing institutional access to Bitcoin. Educational Initiatives: Financial institutions will likely ramp up efforts to educate their clients on the benefits and risks of Bitcoin ETFs, fostering greater understanding and potentially driving more inflows. While the journey of Bitcoin and the broader crypto market is always filled with its share of ups and downs, the consistent positive inflows into these ETFs underscore a significant and undeniable trend: institutional money is here, and it’s increasingly making its presence felt. This marks a new chapter in Bitcoin’s story, one where it’s not just a speculative asset but a recognized and increasingly integrated component of global investment portfolios. The recent surge in Bitcoin Inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs, spearheaded by giants like BlackRock’s IBIT, is a powerful indicator of growing institutional confidence and the increasing maturity of the crypto market. Four consecutive days of positive net inflows, totaling $80.08 million on July 8, highlight a robust demand for regulated Bitcoin exposure. This trend is not just about numbers; it signifies a broader acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, promising enhanced liquidity, stability, and potentially further price appreciation. As Institutional Bitcoin Adoption continues to accelerate, driven by the accessibility and convenience of ETFs, the future of Crypto Market Trends looks increasingly intertwined with traditional finance, opening new avenues for growth and investment.

South Korea’s government is taking steps to support the crypto industry by officially recognizing crypto businesses as part of its venture ecosystem. A new proposal from the Ministry of SMEs and Startups aims to let crypto firms register as “venture companies” – a status that gives access to tax cuts, government-backed funding, subsidies, and loan guarantees. If approved, the move could bring crypto startups in line with other tech-driven businesses and help boost innovation across the sector. Here is everything you absolutely need to know. A Big Policy U-Turn for South Korea Right now, crypto businesses in South Korea are excluded from registering as venture companies. That’s because current laws group them with restricted sectors like gambling and nightlife which are categories that don’t qualify for state support. That restriction has cost crypto firms. In 2018, Upbit’s parent company Dunamu lost its venture status and was hit with an ₩24 billion (around $18 million) tax bill. The company challenged the decision in court, but lost. The ministry now wants to update the rules. The new proposal would remove virtual asset firms from the restricted list, allowing them to access the same support as other startups. “Virtual asset businesses with innovative and entrepreneurial qualities, based on new technologies, will be newly recognized as venture businesses,” the ministry said. Why This Matters for the Industry If the change is approved, it would mean crypto startups could apply for venture status for the first time, unlocking major benefits. It would also allow existing venture-certified companies to enter the crypto space without losing their status. According to the ministry, the change would “revitalize and broaden the venture ecosystem” and promote growth in the crypto industry. The government is now collecting public feedback on the proposal, with submissions open until August 18, 2025. A Clear Direction Under President Lee The proposal is part of a wider shift under President Lee Jae Myung, who took office last month with a strong pro-crypto stance. His administration is pushing for spot Bitcoin ETFs, planning to introduce a Korean won-based stablecoin, and reviewing the current ban on institutional crypto trading. Some of the country’s biggest banks are already taking steps, from exploring stablecoin products to filing new trademark applications, showing that interest is building. Here’s the bottom line: If passed, this policy could open new doors for crypto businesses in South Korea giving them access to real financial support, and helping the country position itself as a serious player in global crypto innovation.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/crypto-firms-in-south-korea-set-to-finally-gain-legal-status-tax-incentives/,"REGULATION|ASIA|BTC|EXCHANGE|TRADING","News",cryptocompare
2025-07-09T10:06:11,"New Zealand Government Decides to Ban Crypto ATMs! Here's Why","The New Zealand government has decided to ban crypto ATMs in the country and impose a NZD 5,000 limit on international cash transfers. New Zealand Bans Crypto ATMs and Limits Cash Transfers This comprehensive regulation aims to reshape the AML/CFT regime (Anti-Money Laundering/Counter Financing of Terrorism) within the framework of the fight against money laundering and organized crime. The 221 crypto ATMs operating in the country have been scrutinized for allegedly being used in illegal transactions such as transferring criminal proceeds abroad and drug trafficking. New Zealand Deputy Justice Minister Nicole McKee announced the new bill today, stating that the reform would expand the powers of both police and financial regulators, allow intelligence agencies to collect financial data more comprehensively, and that a new funding cut to finance the system would be discussed. “This government wants to go after criminals with determination. Our aim is to make New Zealand the easiest place in the world to do legitimate business and the hardest place in the world for criminals,” McKee said. The new regulation has been welcomed by some in the industry as a positive step. Janine Grainger, co-founder of crypto trading platform Easy Crypto, said the ban is a sign of maturation in the industry, adding: “We've been watching the rapid proliferation of crypto ATMs, but we want this growth to proceed safely and compliantly. That's why we support the ban.” Grainger emphasized that crypto ATMs often operate with high transaction fees of up to 20%, which has now lost its appeal for many users. Arjun Vijay, founder of Giottus crypto exchange, stated that without security measures such as identity verification (KYC), misuse of these devices is inevitable: Bitcoin ATMs, with their high fees and anonymous transaction features, are often used for illicit fund movements. This ban is not surprising. New Zealand's decision comes amid growing global concerns about crypto ATMs being used for criminal activities. In Australia, AUSTRAC has placed the industry under surveillance, citing a rise in crypto scams targeting the elderly. The US city of Spokane has completely banned crypto kiosks after FBI data linked the devices to $5.6 billion in fraud in 2024. It is stated that the ban in New Zealand is not a “setback” in the crypto sector, but rather a sign of a transition to a more robust and secure structure. *This is not investment advice.

Large holders are quietly exiting their positions and the sell signals are becoming harder to ignore. On-chain data shows trillions of SHIB tokens have been moved to exchanges, pointing to a growing loss of confidence among whales. Smart money is shifting to projects that promise real-world value, like Remittix (RTX) . Shiba Inu (SHIB) Faces Sell-off Shiba Inu is trading around $0.00001187, sliding in response to recent whale activity. Market data shows that Santiment reports over half of SHIB’s supply is controlled by just ten wallets. When big holders move their tokens, the impact can be swift and severe. Source: CoinMarketCap A massive single-day drop of over 12% took SHIB to $0.00001177 after trillions of tokens shifted to exchanges. CoinDesk flagged a whale transaction of 2.87 trillion SHIB worth $36 million, but later noted this was a custody transfer, not a sale. Even so, Binance data and other exchanges report similar shifts for institutional wallets, signaling a broader withdrawal of confidence. Despite the sell-off, the number of SHIB wallets has exceeded 1.5 million. The Shibarium Layer 2 migration also continues, with over 1.5 million users already on board. That’s solid ecosystem growth. Shibarium has logged more than 1.2 billion transactions and counts over 266 million connected wallets, a signal that the community is still engaged. But on-chain activity doesn’t always prevent price drops. SHIB now hovers near a critical support level of $0.0000102. Breaks below that could trigger deeper losses, possibly reaching lows near $0.0000060. Why Traders Are Watching Remittix One of the projects catching attention right now is Remittix (RTX) . Unlike meme tokens, RTX solves an actual problem. It lets users convert crypto like SHIB, ETH or BTC into FIAT currencies and send it straight to a bank account, all in one step. Remittix is already catching the attention of freelancers, remote workers and everyday crypto users who just want a simple way to use their earnings. Users don’t need to shuffle through multiple apps or jump between exchanges. Remittix supports over 100 cryptocurrencies and works with 30+ FIAT currencies, so people can cash out or hold onto their money with ease. That kind of convenience is exactly why more users are starting to take notice. As more traders shift focus from hype to utility, tokens like RTX are stepping into the spotlight. They’re not promising the moon. They’re delivering a service people already need. Expert Verdict Gives Remittix the Edge Whale exits, centralized token control and unstable burn rates make Shiba Inu risky in the short term. Ecosystem momentum like Shibarium helps, but might not be enough to offset declining core support. Meanwhile, Remittix is delivering tangible value: crypto-to-cash access that works today. For those steering away from meme coins and looking for utility, Remittix could be the next smart move.

Several altcoins have posted more impressive gains within the same timeframe, including CRO, which skyrocketed by over 17% at one point, and LINK, which is up by 5%. CRO on the Run Following news that Truth Social, the social media giant operated by the Trump family, had filed with the US SEC to launch a Crypto Blue-Chip ETF, which would include BTC, ETH, SOL, CRO, and XRP, the price of the Cronos ecosystem exploded by double-digits. The asset went from roughly $0.082 to $0.095, corrected slightly, but shot up once again in the past day to over $0.1 for the first time in about a month. Although it has lost some traction since then and is currently down to $0.095, it’s still up by over 15% on the day. The other assets mentioned in the filing are also in the green, albeit in a less impressive manner. SOL, XRP, and ETH are up by 1-2% daily. More notable price pumps come from NEAR, AAVE, XLM, HBAR, and LINK, all of which have added around 5-6% of value.

2025-07-09T10:00:19,"3 Crypto Altcoins Surging in July: Trump Token, FloppyPEPE, HyperLiquid","Altcoin Season Heats Up: Market Rotation in Full Swing The crypto market in July 2025 is defined by one clear trend: Bitcoin is consolidating, and altcoins are exploding. As BTC holds steady around the $108K–$110K range, traders are rotating into high-potential alts to chase higher returns. This behavior is a typical hallmark of altcoin season, and it’s unfolding rapidly across meme coins, DeFi platforms, and political tokens alike. Retail interest has resurged, driven by viral narratives and the rise of meme-fi—a hybrid category blending internet culture with real use cases. In this environment, altcoins that combine hype with utility are outperforming, and three standout tokens are drawing serious attention: Trump Token, FloppyPEPE, and HyperLiquid. Each reflects a different narrative, making them prime candidates for diversified exposure. Trump Token: Politics Meets Crypto Trump Token is seeing a wave of speculative investment following renewed campaign buzz and political influencer backing. With the 2024 election aftermath still influencing narratives, this token has remained in the spotlight. Its meme-heavy branding and association with conservative influencers have made it a lightning rod for both attention and controversy. While its price has seen volatility, its staying power shows that political narratives continue to resonate in crypto. Supporters view Trump Token as a digital reflection of a political movement, and that’s precisely where its strength lies. As major events—such as debates, rallies, or endorsements—arise, Trump Token tends to react quickly in the market. For those trading momentum or news-driven spikes, this token is a high-risk, high-reward asset. FloppyPEPE: Meme-Fi With Tools FloppyPEPE continues to raise presale capital—now over $2.7 million—while offering real tools like FloppyAI and Meme-o-matic. The FLOPPY100 bonus code adds extra value for early backers. Its product-first approach gives it a strong edge over purely viral meme tokens. FloppyAI allows users to generate viral meme content automatically, while Meme-o-matic helps deploy them across socials with ease. This unique angle empowers creators, giving FPPE community members the ability to be more than just holders—they become active contributors to the brand’s visibility. With a roadmap that includes staking, governance, and a zero-gas meme exchange called FloppyX, FloppyPEPE isn’t just another meme—it’s a movement. HyperLiquid: Scalable DeFi Without Gas This DeFi protocol offers zero-gas trading and cross-chain liquidity, gaining traction among institutional DeFi users. Its recent partnership with LayerZero is boosting confidence. HyperLiquid is focused on usability and composability, key traits in the future of decentralized finance. By removing gas fees from the trading experience, HyperLiquid drastically lowers the entry barrier for everyday traders and arbitrage bots alike. The platform has also integrated real-time charting tools and advanced analytics, making it a serious contender among DeFi protocols. Its momentum in Q3 suggests that it could be a backbone protocol for the next leg of the DeFi bull cycle. Price Trends and Breakout Setups All three coins have shown strong upward momentum, with FloppyPEPE outperforming on presale growth and Trump Token surging on news events. HyperLiquid is climbing gradually alongside broader DeFi strength. The differing breakout setups offer traders multiple entry styles—from fast momentum to slower trend following. FloppyPEPE’s price is expected to jump significantly after exchange listings, driven by community virality and early adopter benefits. Trump Token’s performance hinges on media cycles, while HyperLiquid’s technical chart pattern is forming a bullish ascending triangle. With altcoin sentiment heating up, all three tokens are under watch by technical analysts. Community Growth Metrics Trump Token’s X engagement is up 40%. FloppyPEPE’s Telegram gained over 5K members in one week. HyperLiquid saw a 30% rise in daily active users. Social and on-chain engagement is a key indicator of momentum, and FloppyPEPE leads in this category. Its meme contests, creator bounties, and referral programs have created a flywheel effect. Trump Token remains politically polarizing, which fuels both fandom and backlash-driven engagement, while HyperLiquid’s traction is quieter but steadily building within DeFi circles.

The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. Manta/USDT 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for a hold above EMA lines The 4-hour Manta price chart suggests MANTA continues to face bearish activity around EMA lines, creating a negative sentiment on the price chart.

MANTAUSD Price Chart by TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, Manta’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.172, resulting in a correction to $0.155. Is MANTA a good investment? Manta’s rapid rise in DeFi TVL charts and alignment with Ethereum ‘s scaling roadmap via technologies like Manta Pacific suggest $MANTA’s potential. Grants support its ecosystem growth, and it leads in ZK technology adoption, promising for blockchain ‘s future. However, regulatory concerns over transaction privacy could affect its long-term viability, potentially impacting ZK protocols like $MANTA. Overall, Manta is a good investment if you want a profitable return in the long term. Why is the Manta price up today? Manta price has triggered a strong bullish rally toward $0.189. This occurred after buyers gained confidence and accumulated heavily around $0.17. Will Manta price recover? If bulls hold the price above $0.2, we might see further recovery toward immediate resistance channels. Will Manta price reach $10? In recent months, the Manta network expanded its offerings and established multiple partnerships. If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $10 mark. Will Manta reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment, the MNT price might take several years to reach the $100 milestone. We expect the Manta price to achieve $100 by 2060. Will Manta reach $1000? $1000 is a distant dream for Manta price. However, if everything remains in favor of the altcoin market, we might even see the MNT price hitting $1K. Is Manta a good long-term investment? Investors are bullish on Manta, which has gained significant attention in recent months. If developers continue to build robust utilities for Manta and the roadmap fulfills user demand, it can be a good long-term investment option. Recent MANTA news/ opinions Kenny Li, one of the co-founders of Manta Network, was recently almost tricked by a phishing scam carried out by the well-known hacking group Lazarus.

2025-07-09T09:57:39,"Bitcoin to $1 Million in Months? Samson Mow Reveals Shocking Scenario","The post Bitcoin to $1 Million in Months? Samson Mow Reveals Shocking Scenario appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with a positive update from Samson Mow, the vocal CEO of JAN3 and a Bitcoin advocate. He reveals a delightful prediction: Bitcoin could soar to $1 million per coin in a matter of weeks to months. In a recent interview , Mow outlined his concept of “hyperbitcoinization,” a transformative change in which Bitcoin emerges as a fundamental element of the global financial system. As fiat currencies jiggle and countries are coining forward to adopt crypto, Mow’s vision is enchanting both investors and skeptics. The $1 Million Bitcoin Scenario Explained Mow’s prediction relies on a sudden and steep increase, rather than a gradual rise. He describes the rise as a “brief and fierce surge” that might push Bitcoin’s worth to $1 million. “ They don’t gradually fail, they fail spectacularly “, Mow stated, citing fiat currencies, indicating the increasing global economic turmoil. With inflation reducing faith in traditional currency, Bitcoin’s decentralized features place it as a refuge, placing its worth at unmatched levels. Hyperbitcoinization: Governments Quietly Joining In Mow believes governments are already preparing for this shift. One example he gave is Bhutan, which has been mining Bitcoin since 2019. Today, its Bitcoin holdings are reportedly worth close to one trillion dollars – a signal, he says, that hyperbitcoinization is already underway. Violent upheaval is the most likely scenario. #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/Ibk5qtOVgi — Samson Mow (@Excellion) July 8, 2025 Countries with abundant energy resources are in a unique position, Mow explained. They can use their excess energy to mine Bitcoin, boost their reserves, and use the funds to pay down debt or support national projects. This, he believes, could help some nations stabilize their economies while shifting toward a Bitcoin-based financial model. Bitcoin Bonds Could Redefine Sovereign Debt Mow also sees a future where governments begin issuing Bitcoin-backed sovereign debt. This could lead to a new kind of global Bitcoin Bond market. He pointed to MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, whose company has used Bitcoin to raise funds successfully. That strategy, Mow said, could soon be adopted by countries. “It’s simply a matter of time before every country pulls that trigger,” Mow asserted. If that happens, Bitcoin’s demand and price could rise sharply, pushing it toward that $1 million mark. What’s Next for Bitcoin? With global uncertainty growing and more governments exploring Bitcoin, Mow’s vision of hyperbitcoinization may not be far off. If countries begin using Bitcoin to back their reserves or issue debt, the cryptocurrency could shift from being just an investment to becoming a core part of the global economy. Whether Bitcoin hits $1 million remains to be seen but the pieces, according to Mow, are already falling into place.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-to-1-million-in-months-samson-mow-reveals-shocking-scenario/,"BTC|FIAT|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING","News",cryptocompare
2025-07-09T09:57:00,"Eigen Labs lays off employees to focus on EigenCloud growth, EIGEN rallies","Cryptocurrencies performed well on Wednesday, with Bitcoin steady despite the new tariff wave . Eigen Labs’ native token has turned bullish amidst the optimism, possibly driven by the latest ecosystem announcement. According to Blockworks , EigenLayer’s team has reduced its workforce by laying off roughly 25% of the staff, 29 employees. The move is part of a strategic plan to streamline operations and ensure laser focus on the new developer platform, EigenCloud. Meanwhile, this comes after the crypto firm launched EigenCloud in mid-June to explore on- and off-chain verification, a sector gaining increased traction as blockchain integrates with AI. Eigen Labs CEO Sreeram Kannan commented on the decision, stating: While today’s reorganisation is painful, I’m extremely optimistic about our future. Demand for verifiable computing is growing as developers build software for the AI era, and EigenCloud is uniquely positioned to service this market need with a cloud platform backed by billions in stake and thousands of operators around the world. While financial challenges often trigger substantial layoffs, Eigen Labs emphasizes it’s not the case. A strategic pivot and not a financial calamity Eigen’s latest layoffs are part of the company’s long-term strategy and not a response to a financial crisis. The company boasts monetary stability. Venture capital firm A16z supported the project with $70 million during the EigenCloud launch, adding to its previous investments. Eigen Labs has raised $220 million, including the $50 million Series A funding in 2023 Kannan highlighted that they are aiming to reorganize resources around EigenCloud and streamline the team to fuel long-term growth. While the decision could be painful, Kannan trusts it was necessary. He expressed gratitude to the departing team, who have been key in building Eigen Lab’s early stages. The firm will support the impacted employees with accelerated token vesting and a 3-month base salary. Also, Eigen Labs promised career support to help ex-staff gain stability. Understanding EigenCloud: why does it matter? EigenCloud is a developer-centric platform offering verifiable compute tools to support advanced decentralized applications (dApps). It enables developers to create software with enhanced transparency and trust, elements gaining attention as blockchain and AI blend. Distinguishing machine-generated and real things can be challenging as artificial intelligence gains rapid popularity. EigenCloud aims to meet the growing demand for verifiable computing through its global network of operators and stakers. EIGEN price outlook The native token flashed bullish sentiment amidst the layoff news. EIGEN trades at $1.15 after gaining more than 4% in the past 24 hours. Its daily trading volume has increased by over 60%, signaling revived interest in the altcoin. Chart by CoinMarketCap Short-term technical indicators also suggest buyer resurgence, positioning EIGEN for extended gains. Meanwhile, broad market sentiment will likely influence its trajectory in the coming sessions.

2025-07-09T09:50:14,"Digital Asset Oversight: Crucial Senate Hearing Set to Shape US Crypto Policy","The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with anticipation as a significant date approaches on the U.S. political calendar. A crucial Senate Hearing on Digital Asset Oversight has been scheduled, promising to be a pivotal moment for the future of the digital economy. This isn’t just another discussion; it’s an opportunity for stakeholders to voice their perspectives directly to policymakers, potentially laying the groundwork for clearer, more comprehensive Crypto Regulation in the United States. What’s on the Agenda for This Pivotal Senate Hearing? According to Eleanor Terrett, host of Crypto In America, the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition & Forestry has set July 15 for a hearing titled “Stakeholder Perspectives on Federal Oversight of Digital Commodities.” This title itself offers a glimpse into the committee’s focus: understanding how various parties view the regulation of digital assets that fall under the commodity classification. But why the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition & Forestry? It might seem counterintuitive at first glance. However, this committee oversees the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which has a primary role in regulating commodity markets, including derivatives. Many in the crypto space, particularly those dealing with assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, argue that these are commodities, not securities. Therefore, the CFTC, under the purview of this committee, is a key player in determining their regulatory fate. The hearing aims to gather insights from a broad spectrum of stakeholders. This means we can expect representatives from: Crypto Industry: Exchanges, developers, blockchain companies, and advocacy groups. Financial Institutions: Banks, investment firms, and traditional finance players exploring digital assets. Consumer Protection Advocates: Groups focused on safeguarding investors and users. Academic Experts: Researchers and legal scholars specializing in digital assets and financial technology. Government Agencies: Though not directly testifying, their perspectives will certainly influence the discussions. The outcome of such a Senate Hearing could significantly impact how Digital Commodities are traded, custodied, and integrated into the broader financial system. Why is Clear Crypto Regulation So Crucial for US Crypto Policy? The current regulatory landscape for digital assets in the U.S. is often described as a patchwork, leading to confusion and uncertainty. This fragmented approach has hindered innovation for some and left investors vulnerable in other instances. The primary debate often centers around whether a digital asset is a security (under the SEC’s purview) or a commodity (under the CFTC’s). This lack of clarity creates significant challenges: Regulatory Arbitrage: Businesses may seek jurisdictions with more favorable or less stringent rules. Investor Protection Gaps: Without clear rules, consumers might not be adequately protected from fraud or market manipulation. Innovation Stifled: Companies may hesitate to develop new products or services due to uncertain legal frameworks. Market Instability: Unregulated markets can be more volatile and prone to sudden shifts. A unified and comprehensive approach to Crypto Regulation is essential for fostering a healthy, secure, and innovative digital asset ecosystem. This hearing is a vital step towards addressing these complexities and shaping a coherent US Crypto Policy that balances growth with consumer safety. Understanding the Landscape of Digital Asset Oversight The concept of Digital Asset Oversight extends beyond just classifying assets. It involves a holistic approach to managing risks, promoting innovation, and ensuring market integrity. This includes aspects like: Licensing and Registration: Determining which entities need to register with which regulators. Custody Rules: How digital assets are securely stored and managed. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) & Know Your Customer (KYC): Preventing illicit financial activities. Market Surveillance: Monitoring for manipulation and ensuring fair trading practices. Taxation: Clarifying how digital asset transactions are taxed. Each of these areas presents its own set of challenges and requires careful consideration. The stakeholders presenting at the hearing will likely bring diverse perspectives on how best to implement effective Digital Asset Oversight without stifling the nascent industry’s potential. The goal is to build a regulatory framework that supports legitimate innovation while weeding out bad actors and protecting everyday users. What Does This Mean for the Future of Digital Commodities? The hearing’s specific focus on “ Digital Commodities ” signals a recognition of their distinct nature from traditional securities. This distinction is crucial because it determines which regulatory body has primary jurisdiction and what rules apply. If a clear framework for digital commodities emerges, it could: Boost Institutional Adoption: Clarity encourages more traditional financial institutions to enter the space. Enhance Market Liquidity: Increased participation can lead to deeper and more stable markets. Facilitate New Products: Clear rules enable the development of regulated derivatives, ETFs, and other financial products. Reduce Legal Uncertainty: Companies operating with digital commodities would have a clearer path for compliance. The outcome of this hearing, and subsequent legislative efforts, will significantly influence how assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum are treated within the U.S. financial system. It could pave the way for more robust, regulated markets for Digital Commodities , benefiting both investors and the broader economy. Actionable Insights for Navigating US Crypto Policy Changes For individuals and businesses involved in the digital asset space, staying informed about evolving US Crypto Policy is paramount. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Follow legislative developments, regulatory announcements, and industry news closely. Resources like official government websites, reputable crypto news outlets, and industry analyses are invaluable. Engage with Policymakers: If you’re a business or an active participant, consider supporting advocacy groups that represent your interests. Your voice, collectively, can influence policy direction. Prepare for Compliance: Assume that more regulation is coming. Businesses should start reviewing their operations to ensure they can adapt to new compliance requirements related to licensing, AML, and reporting. Understand Your Assets: Know whether the digital assets you hold or deal with are likely to be classified as securities or commodities, as this dictates their regulatory treatment. Seek Expert Advice: Consult with legal and financial professionals who specialize in digital assets to navigate complex regulatory landscapes. The path to comprehensive US Crypto Policy is a marathon, not a sprint. This hearing is a significant milestone, but the journey will require ongoing dialogue, collaboration, and adaptation from all sides. A Defining Moment for Digital Assets The upcoming U.S. Senate hearing on Digital Asset Oversight on July 15 is more than just a procedural event; it’s a defining moment for the digital asset industry. By gathering diverse stakeholder perspectives on Digital Commodities , the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition & Forestry is taking a critical step towards establishing a clearer, more predictable framework for Crypto Regulation . The discussions held and the insights gained from this Senate Hearing will undoubtedly play a crucial role in shaping future US Crypto Policy . While challenges remain, the commitment to open dialogue offers hope for a balanced regulatory environment that fosters innovation, protects consumers, and integrates digital assets into the mainstream financial system responsibly. The future of digital finance in the U.S. hangs in the balance, and this hearing is a testament to its growing importance.

2025-07-09T09:45:52,"Why are companies turning to Ethereum treasuries?","Several companies are placing bets on treasury strategies that involve Ethereum (ETH), as more institutions take up positions on the world’s second-largest crypto. ETH was trading up 2% on the day at $2,624 at the time of writing, having failed to break past the $2,600 resistance level late last week. Ethereum has gone up over 7% in the past week and is up 2.8% intraday. According to market analysts, even with institutional involvement, the asset is still trading within a tight range, locked in a sideways channel that has persisted for two months. Speaking on CNBC’s Squawk Box, Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin recently said corporate interest in Ethereum is climbing because they want to “tell the Ethereum story.” “What does Wall Street pay attention to? It pays attention to being able to make money,” he reckoned. GameSquare holdings commences $100 Million ETH treasury plan According to a July 8 press statement , GameSquare Holdings announced the launch of an ETH-based treasury strategy, against the backdrop of a partnership with crypto capital management firm Dialectic. The news took the company’s stock 0.57% upwards of its Tuesday closing session price, now changing hands at $1.54, according to Google Finance data . GameSquare’s Board has approved a total ETH allocation of up to $100 million, which will be deployed in stages while providing liquidity for ongoing operations. The ETH-focused treasury is built on Dialectic’s proprietary Medici platform, which integrates machine learning, automated optimization, and risk management systems. GameSquare is targeting annual yields of 8-14%, well above the current staking benchmarks of 3-4%. To help fund the Ether acquisitions, GameSquare launched a public offering of over 8.4 million shares at $0.95 per share to raise approximately $8 million. The offering was filed under a registration statement declared effective by the SEC on June 4 and is expected to close by July 9. SharpLink acquires over $533 million in ETH Another Media and Sports betting technology company, SharpLink Gaming, disclosed on Tuesday that it now holds 205,634 ETH, valued at more than $533 million, bought between June 28 and July 4.

As reported by Cryptopolitan, SharpLink’s stock rallied 7% after announcing a $30 million Ether purchase on June 25, bringing its holdings to 188,000 ETH. The company has committed all of its Ether holdings to staking and restaking protocols, earning 322 ETH in rewards, worth roughly $848,750, since June 2. SharpLink raised $64 million in net proceeds to fund the ETH investments, by selling more than 5.4 million shares. In May, it filed plans to sell up to $1 billion in common stock, with the bulk of the proceeds earmarked for more ETH acquisitions. Lubin, who is SharpLink’s chairman, said the strategy is rooted in financial discipline and transparency. “Our sustained success is a direct result of SharpLink’s disciplined execution of its ETH-centric treasury management strategy,” he remarked. Lubin explained that adding ETH to corporate treasuries helps to reduce excess Ether supply and could eventually create positive price pressure. Bit Digital goes all-in on Ethereum Meanwhile, earlier this week, Nasdaq-listed Bit Digital has completely exited its Bitcoin holdings in favor of Ethereum. The company sold all of its BTC assets, raising $172 million in the process, and used the funds to acquire more than 100,000 ETH. After buying Ethereum, Bit Digital is reportedly one of the largest corporate Ethereum treasury firms globally. “We believe Ethereum has the ability to rewrite the entire financial system.” CEO Sam Tabar told reporters earlier this week. “We are starting with exposure to over 100K ETH for now, but we intend to aggressively add more so we become the preeminent ETH holding company in the world.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-07-09T09:35:25,"Remixpoint’s Bold Move: Japanese Energy Firm Secures $215M for Massive Bitcoin Acquisition","In a fascinating development that underscores the growing intersection of traditional industries and the digital asset world, Japanese energy consulting firm Remixpoint has made headlines with a significant announcement. The company, known for its ventures in energy, used car sales, and even virtual currency exchange, recently declared via X (formerly Twitter) that it has successfully raised an impressive ¥31.5 billion, equivalent to approximately $215 million. But what makes this news truly captivating is the intended use of these substantial funds: a strategic and ambitious Bitcoin acquisition . Why is Remixpoint Acquiring Bitcoin ? A Deep Dive into Their Strategy Remixpoint’s decision to allocate such a substantial sum towards Bitcoin is a clear indicator of a shifting paradigm in corporate finance. The firm aims to expand its current BTC holdings from 1,051 BTC to a staggering 3,000 BTC. This isn’t just a casual investment; it represents a deliberate and strategic pivot for a company rooted in energy consulting. So, why Bitcoin, and why now? Inflation Hedge: In an era of economic uncertainty and fluctuating fiat currencies, many companies view Bitcoin as a robust hedge against inflation. Its decentralized nature and fixed supply make it an attractive alternative to traditional assets susceptible to monetary policy changes. Store of Value: Bitcoin has increasingly been recognized as ‘digital gold’—a reliable store of value that can preserve purchasing power over time. For Remixpoint, this could be a long-term treasury management strategy. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset like Bitcoin to a corporate treasury can help diversify risk and potentially enhance overall portfolio returns, especially given the volatility of energy markets. Future-Proofing: As the global economy continues to digitalize, embracing cryptocurrencies can position a company at the forefront of financial innovation, potentially attracting new investors and talent. This move by Remixpoint isn’t isolated. It follows a trend set by other forward-thinking corporations like MicroStrategy, which has aggressively accumulated Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset. This growing interest from established firms lends further credibility and stability to the cryptocurrency market. Understanding the Broader Corporate Bitcoin Strategy Trend Remixpoint’s move highlights a significant trend: the increasing adoption of Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset. This isn’t just about speculation; it’s about a fundamental shift in how companies perceive and manage their balance sheets. Several factors contribute to this evolving corporate Bitcoin strategy : Benefits for Corporations: Potential for Appreciation: While volatile, Bitcoin has historically offered significant returns, potentially boosting a company’s asset base. Global Accessibility: Bitcoin offers a borderless, permissionless financial system, which can be advantageous for international operations. Transparency and Security: The blockchain’s transparent ledger and robust cryptographic security offer unique advantages over traditional financial systems, reducing counterparty risk. Challenges and Considerations: Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price swings can be dramatic, posing risks to corporate balance sheets if not managed carefully. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally, which can create compliance challenges. Security Risks: Storing significant amounts of Bitcoin requires sophisticated security measures to prevent hacks and theft. Companies embarking on this path often engage specialized custody solutions and robust risk management frameworks to mitigate these challenges. Remixpoint’s substantial raise suggests a well-thought-out plan rather than a hasty decision. Implications for the Japanese Energy Firm and Beyond As a prominent Japanese energy firm , Remixpoint’s foray into large-scale Bitcoin acquisition sends a strong signal to both the traditional finance sector and the cryptocurrency market in Japan and globally. Japan has historically been a significant player in the crypto space, with early adoption and a relatively progressive regulatory stance. This move by Remixpoint could: Inspire Others: Encourage other Japanese corporations, particularly those in tech and energy, to explore similar treasury strategies. Boost Local Crypto Market: Increase liquidity and demand within the Japanese cryptocurrency ecosystem. Enhance Bitcoin’s Legitimacy: Further solidify Bitcoin’s status as a legitimate asset class for institutional investors and corporations worldwide. The energy sector, in particular, has an interesting relationship with Bitcoin, given the energy consumption associated with mining. However, as more mining operations shift towards renewable energy sources, and as companies like Remixpoint integrate digital assets into their core business, the synergy between energy and crypto could become increasingly positive and innovative. Navigating the Future of BTC Holdings : Risks and Opportunities For Remixpoint, managing its expanded BTC holdings will be crucial. While the potential for upside is significant, so are the inherent risks of cryptocurrency markets. Effective management will involve: Custody Solutions: Utilizing secure, institutional-grade custody providers to protect the assets. Risk Management: Implementing clear policies for managing price volatility, potentially through hedging strategies or by maintaining a long-term outlook. Regulatory Compliance: Staying abreast of evolving regulations in Japan and international markets to ensure full compliance. This strategic investment by Remixpoint also opens up possibilities for future innovations. Could we see more energy firms exploring blockchain technology for energy trading, supply chain management, or even tokenized energy assets? The possibilities are vast, and Remixpoint’s bold move positions them as a potential pioneer in this evolving landscape. The Bigger Picture: What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Acquisition on a Global Scale? Remixpoint’s substantial Bitcoin acquisition is more than just a company-specific event; it’s a testament to the growing institutional confidence in Bitcoin as a viable asset. As more corporations, large and small, consider or execute similar strategies, the overall market capitalization and stability of Bitcoin could see significant long-term benefits. This trend signifies a maturation of the cryptocurrency market, moving beyond retail speculation to serious institutional adoption. For individual investors and market observers, Remixpoint’s action serves as a strong signal. It suggests that despite market fluctuations, the underlying value proposition of Bitcoin as a decentralized, scarce, and globally accessible asset continues to resonate with sophisticated corporate treasuries looking for alternative ways to manage capital and drive future growth. Conclusion: A New Era of Corporate Finance Remixpoint’s decision to raise $215 million for a substantial Bitcoin acquisition marks a pivotal moment, not just for the company, but for the broader corporate adoption of digital assets. It highlights a strategic vision that looks beyond traditional financial instruments, embracing Bitcoin as a core component of future growth and treasury management. As more companies follow suit, we are likely to witness a profound transformation in corporate finance, where digital assets play an increasingly central role. This move by a Japanese energy consulting firm underscores Bitcoin’s growing legitimacy and its undeniable place in the global financial landscape.

2025-07-09T09:33:49,"Expert Says One Last Chance for a Shiba Inu Move: Here’s The Target","A building momentum on the Shiba Inu weekly chart suggests a trend reversal is on the horizon, with an analyst identifying its target. ZelfTrade shared this emerging momentum in a TradingView analysis , asserting that Shiba Inu has one last shot at a massive rally. If it does respond as the new trend suggests, the analyst shared the possible target for the rally.Notably, this comes as Shiba Inu continues to consolidate southwards. On the weekly timeframe, it has posted seven red candles in the past eight weeks, joining a broader struggle in the altcoin market.Shiba Inu On a Pivotal SupportFor context, ZelfTrade highlighted that Shiba Inu sits on a crucial support area, which has cushioned further price downtrends. SHIB retested the support at $0.000010 in mid-June and has held the zone so far. Notably, it bounced from the demand zone in April, rallying 71% to its high of $0.00001765 in May before the recent retracement. Shiba Inu AnalysisZelfTrade Shiba Inu Analysis | ZelfTrade However, the market watcher noted that a clean swing failure pattern (SFP) is forming around the support area. Notably, this pattern forms when prices break out but fail to sustain the momentum, subsequently declining extensively.This trend emerged following Shiba’s rally from its current support level to $0.00001765, followed by a strong reversal back to the demand zone. If the momentum reversal sustains, the analyst expects a quick rebound to higher prices.Specifically, he predicted a two-fold rally from the current price, citing how well Shiba Inu has held the support as a possible catalyst. Notably, a 2x rally would take SHIB’s price to a six-month high of $0.00002394.Meanwhile, he emphasized that Bitcoin’s price action will play a vital role in this uptrend. He noted that the crypto leader needs to cool off over the next two months and allow altcoins to regain bullish momentum. Several other analysts have shared this sentiment , citing Bitcoin’s growing market dominance as a reason why altcoins have been underperforming.Shiba Inu Could Capitulate by Another 50% Despite ZelfTrade’s bullish sentiments, he believes that a lack of upward price action from Shiba Inu could trigger another capitulation. For context, he noted that if Bitcoin fails to pass the baton over to altcoins soon, SHIB could lose the current support and drop another 50%.Shiba Inu is already 86% away from its all-time high of $0.00008845 and 64% away from its January high of $0.00003343. Another 50% drop would ensure that the meme coin adds more zeroes to its valuation and drops to $0.00000598, a price last seen in June 2023.At the time of writing, Shiba Inu trades at $0.00001197.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/07/09/expert-says-one-last-chance-for-a-shiba-inu-move-heres-the-target/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=expert-says-one-last-chance-for-a-shiba-inu-move-heres-the-target,"SHIB|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BTC","Market|Latest Shiba Inu (SHIB) News Today|Shiba Inu Price Prediction",cryptocompare

2025-07-09T09:31:42,"Best Crypto to Buy Now As Bitcoin ETF Inflows Skyrocket Again","Bitcoin ETF inflows have surged once more, and the effect on the crypto market has been immediate. In the past month alone, over 50,000 BTC has poured into institutional products, marking a clear return of appetite from funds that had previously stepped back. This resurgence has reignited speculative interest, pulling the market out of its post-correction slump. Sentiment, which had hovered near neutral for weeks, has quickly turned bullish again. With liquidity returning and risk appetite building, market structure looks ready to shift into a more aggressive phase. Bitcoin Dominance Slips as Altcoins Eye Breakout Territory While ETF inflows continue to support Bitcoin’s trajectory, a more nuanced trend is playing out beneath the surface. Bitcoin dominance, which refers to the percentage of total market capitalization held by Bitcoin, has faced multiple rejections at the 65 percent level and is now in retreat once again. This metric is often overlooked during bullish periods, but historically, its decline has been a strong precursor to altcoin rallies. When dominance falls, it signals that capital is rotating out of Bitcoin and into smaller-cap assets, often in search of higher returns as market confidence grows. That environment appears to be forming now. With Ecoinometrics projecting a potential Bitcoin price target of 117,000 dollars based on ETF inflow momentum, the overarching sentiment remains bullish. Yet as more traders begin to position themselves ahead of that move, the appetite for altcoins is naturally picking up. Bitcoin ETF flows are lining up behind a breakout.With rolling 30-day inflows nearing 50K BTC and rising, you’d expect more upside for Bitcoin’s price.Our ETF flow-to-price model suggests an expected target of $117,000. pic.twitter.com/d2NW3yZYRM — ecoinometrics (@ecoinometrics) July 6, 2025 Dominance breakouts typically require multiple attempts before giving way, but the current chart structure suggests weakening support. If Bitcoin dominance drops below key levels in the coming days, the market could quickly pivot into what many consider the early phase of altseason. Altcoin activity has already shown early signs of life across several segments, from mid-cap infrastructure plays to smaller ecosystem tokens. Volume is returning. New narratives are being tested. And perhaps most importantly, traders are starting to shift away from defensive positions. In that context, a breakdown in dominance may act less as a warning sign and more as a green light. If it plays out, the broader crypto market could be in for a strong leg up. Best Crypto to Buy Now – Altcoins With High Growth Potential and Low Price Tags Bitcoin Hyper Not all Layer 2s are built to echo the architecture of their base chain. Bitcoin Hyper leans into the idea that Bitcoin’s strength lies not only in its scarcity but also in the consistency of its economic rhythm. While most Layer 2s chase modularity or scaling throughput, Bitcoin Hyper focuses on how network activity can sync with market psychology. Its design does not simply add speed or reduce costs. It translates Bitcoin’s value language into something developers and token ecosystems can build on. The reason this matters now is because capital is looking to spread out again. The ETF narrative has created gravitational pull around Bitcoin, but it has also opened the door for infrastructure built around it. Bitcoin Hyper exists exactly in that space. It inherits security assumptions from Bitcoin without diluting them, and more importantly, it enables value and interaction layers to emerge without altering the base chain. The project has already received praise from top crypto content creators like ClayBro , who have noted its utility and potential adoptability through posts or videos on platforms such as YouTube. There is also a clarity in its roadmap that helps distinguish it from the rest. Rather than promising ambiguous integrations or questionable partnerships, Bitcoin Hyper focuses on one mission: making Bitcoin programmable without friction. In a time when traders are watching dominance metrics closely and waiting for altcoin momentum, Bitcoin Hyper represents a rare project that aligns with both conviction and timing. It is not trying to ride Bitcoin’s coattails. It is trying to be the rails for what comes next. Snorter The crypto market has always been a breeding ground for experimentation, but few projects lean into that reality as deliberately as Snorter . It is a Telegram-native bot that runs on AI logic, turning real-time chat activity into an actionable layer for trading and research. That may sound technical, but its utility is straightforward: it is a plug-and-play engine for information efficiency inside Telegram, a platform already central to crypto community activity. What makes Snorter feel unusually well-timed is how it intersects with a broader market that is starting to move again. As ETFs bring capital back into the space, information speed becomes more valuable. Being first to a narrative, first to volume, or even first to sudden token movement can be the difference between 20 percent upside and 200 percent. Snorter enables this through microsecond-level alerts, AI-generated call summaries, whale transaction monitors, and sentiment sweeps, all within the app that people are already using. There is also something deeper happening. As altcoins start to heat up again, the ability to analyze token-specific momentum without flipping between ten different dashboards is not just convenient, it is competitive. Snorter strips away noise and makes opportunity feel visible. In a sense, Snorter feels like a response to how cluttered and fragmented crypto has become. Instead of building another analytics terminal, it embeds intelligence directly into the places traders already live. For a cycle that is beginning to demand more agility, that is exactly where utility belongs. SUBBD SUBBD is not trying to reinvent the creator economy. It is attempting to repair it. This is a platform where content creators; not advertisers, not platforms or algorithms are the actual axis of value. At a glance, it may look like just another decentralized content network, but its mechanics suggest otherwise. On SUBBD, influence is not farmed. It is staked, backed, and sustained by a model where creators are partners in protocol growth, not just passengers. The relevance of SUBBD in this current market climate is not abstract. With ETF-driven inflows reshaping investor confidence, crypto users are beginning to look beyond coins and into ecosystems. SUBBD offers one of the few clear examples where user-generated value becomes protocol-level currency. The more creators produce, the more the protocol expands. That is not a metaphor. It is how the system is designed. There is also real traction being built. Creator DAOs are starting to form, allowing groups of influencers or educators to launch tokenized portfolios based on collective visibility. These are not performance gimmicks. They are functional economies. As attention begins to drift away from the majors and into altcoin stories, platforms like SUBBD become more than just use cases. They become reflections of what this cycle could reward not just fast money, but durable networks with real participant loops. It is one thing to watch crypto markets rise. It is another to watch communities rise alongside them. SUBBD, quietly and precisely, is built for that purpose. Best Wallet Token Some wallets exist purely as storage. Best Wallet is the opposite. It functions as a digital command center not just holding assets but shaping how users interact with the broader Web3 universe. The Best Wallet Token powers that ecosystem, threading through layers of access, rewards, governance, and embedded functionality. What makes this more than just another tokenized app is how deliberately it has been built. Rather than overextending into buzzwords, Best Wallet focuses on core principles: speed, clarity, and control. It compresses the chaos of DeFi, NFTs, token swaps, and staking into a format that actually feels navigable. The interface is clean. The UX choices are intentional. And the token is not just ornamental; it is embedded into the platform’s DNA. With ETF inflows signaling a new wave of institutional validation, a rising number of everyday users are re-entering the market. These are not developers or deep technical users. They are people who need intuitive gateways that do not compromise on power. Best Wallet fits that moment with precision. 🔥 Over $13M Raised and Counting! 🔥Best Wallet is becoming the go-to for traders who want speed, simplicity, and early access to what matters:✅ Buy new tokens early, directly in-app✅ Buy and bridge across chains in one place✅ Full portfolio control, no clutterDownload… pic.twitter.com/0SDNVPov6v — Best Wallet (@BestWalletHQ) June 4, 2025 Having raised over 13 million dollars already, what further sets it apart is the modular utility of the token. It is used for fee discounts, early feature access, community decision-making, and vault participation. In a market where tools often feel either overbuilt or underpowered, Best Wallet strikes a rare middle ground. As altcoin appetite builds, infrastructure tokens that enable onboarding, simplify interaction, and reward usage will likely be first in line. Best Wallet Token has positioned itself to be one of those access points; not merely as a layer, but as the welcome mat to the ecosystem itself. Conclusion With Bitcoin ETF momentum rekindling market optimism, crypto appears to be entering a new expansionary phase. Altcoin sentiment is strengthening, dominance is faltering, and capital is beginning to rotate outward in search of growth. The projects highlighted above each align with this shift in different but complementary ways ranging from infrastructure to innovation, and from utility to accessibility. These are not just tokens riding a trend. They are active participants in reshaping how value is stored, shared, and scaled across the crypto space. In a market preparing for its next leg up, these may very well be the kinds of assets worth watching closely. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

More than $11.9 million has already been raised, with a total of more than 12,900 early investors. During presale Phase 6, the token will cost $0.035, and that represents 16.67% return on whatever investment was incurred during Phase 5. Mutuum Finance could hit $1 post launch. Bitcoin’s Steady Climb Signals Where Smart Money Is Moving Bitcoin (BTC) trades around $108,200 at the moment, as institutional investors observed a subdued but eloquent accumulation stage. Within three months, spot Bitcoin ETFs have quietly received over $14 billion, causing the level of control by institutions nearly to 25 percent of circulating supply. And this is not a price shift, it is a positioning shift. With the BTC stabilizing in the $107K to $110K area, there is an apparent growth of large funds gaining exposure to the cryptocurrency in anticipation of a possible Q3 breakout as the next macro leg higher. Against this background, it is not a shock that investors are thinking of diversifying out of BTC into high upside investments such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as part of a multi-prong summer approach.

2025-07-09T09:22:19,"New Zealand to ban crypto ATMs and cap international transfers in latest AML crackdown","New Zealand regulators have unveiled plans to ban cryptocurrency ATMs and implement caps on international transfers in a bid to crack down on money laundering and illicit flows out of the country. New Zealand is home to over 200 virtual currency Kiosks, commonly referred to as crypto ATMs. However, authorities say these machines have become a tool for criminals, enabling them to easily convert cash into cryptocurrencies and transfer it offshore, often to fund organised crime. To thwart misuse, New Zealand’s Associate Justice Minister Nicole McKee unveiled a reform package on July 9 as part of a broader overhaul of the country’s Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) regime. The proposed changes include a full ban on crypto ATMs and a $5,000 cap on international cash transfers, both aimed at blocking common channels exploited by criminal networks. According to McKee, the measures are designed to “target criminals” while easing the regulatory burden on legitimate businesses. “We want New Zealand to be one of the easiest places in the world to do legitimate business and one of the hardest for criminals to hide,” she added. Under the updated framework, the country’s Financial Intelligence Unit will be granted expanded powers to request ongoing information from banks and other reporting entities about individuals flagged for suspicious activity. Notably, legislative progress is already underway, with two amendment bills currently being reviewed by the Parliament. McKee expects the bills to pass by the end of the year, which would remove “some of the most burdensome compliance requirements” for low-risk entities. New Zealand is not a stranger to crypto ATM related crimes. Last year, a report from the New Zealand Ministerial Advisory Group on Transnational, Serious and Organised Crime claimed the bad actors were using these kiosks to quickly convert illicit cash into cryptocurrency and send it offshore to “fund drug imports or to make payments associated with scams.” At the time, the agency recommended a nationwide ban on virtual currency ATMs, which it said was a “key laundering mechanism” and a “significant loophole in the financial system.” Crypto ATMs under scrutiny Although virtual currency kiosks have been touted as a means to bolster grassroots cryptocurrency adoption by making digital assets more accessible, recurring misuse, with bad actors often targeting the elderly and vulnerable, has led to intense scrutiny from regulators worldwide. Last year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) published its 2024 Internet Crime Report, which linked crypto ATMs to over $246 million in fraud-related losses across the United States. Many of these cases involved scammers impersonating government officials or law enforcement, coercing victims into converting cash into crypto at kiosks and sending it to untraceable wallets overseas. Since then, several US jurisdictions have moved to restrict or ban the machines altogether. For instance, in June, Washington’s Spokane city became the first city in the state to enforce a full ban, citing a spike in crypto ATM-related scams. Meanwhile, in Australia, the financial intelligence agency AUSTRAC imposed tighter controls in June 2025, mandating a 5,000 Australian dollar cap on cash transactions at crypto ATMs, along with enhanced customer checks and mandatory scam warnings. One of the first countries to outlaw crypto ATMs was the United Kingdom, where regulators declared all such machines illegal back in 2022 as they failed to comply with local AML rules.

2025-07-09T09:20:11,"Bitcoin eyes gains as dollar index sinks to 21-year lows — Can BTC surge past all-time high?","A weakening U.S. dollar is opening the door for a possible new surge in Bitcoin, stirring questions about whether one of finance’s most familiar patterns is about to play out again. That’s the view in a July 9 analysis shared by CryptoQuant contributor Darkfost, who points out that the U.S. Dollar Index has dropped to a historically weak level. It’s now sitting 6.5 points under its 200-day moving average, the largest gap seen in more than 21 years. Some traditional markets may be concerned about this, but history shows that a declining dollar often creates an environment that is favorable for risky assets like Bitcoin ( BTC ). As traders move their money to assets that might hold value better during currency stress, Bitcoin has frequently increased in value. For instance, when the DXY surged to a 20-year high of 114 in 2022, Bitcoin fell to roughly $16,000, but it bounced back above $40,000 when the dollar fell in late 2023. This trend has repeatedly occurred since 2015, with Bitcoin’s correlation to the dollar index typically ranging from -0.4 to -0.8. You might also like: Bitcoin is deep into its bull run, here’s what comes next: analyst Despite this backdrop, Bitcoin’s price hasn’t broken out just yet. At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $108,712, a small increase of 0.2% in the past 24 hours. It’s still only about 2.7% below its all-time high of $111,814 set on May 22. With volume dropping 18% in a single day to about $21.5 billion, trading activity has cooled off. The derivatives markets have also seen a slowdown in activity, as per data from Coinglass. Open interest has dipped slightly to $73.41 billion, while derivatives trading volume has decreased by roughly 12% to $55.3 billion. This implies that despite the dollar’s decline, traders are still being cautious for the time being. On the technical side, Bitcoin’s signals are mixed. The market is neither significantly overbought nor oversold, according to the relative strength index, which is neutral at 56. Although the momentum indicator itself has entered negative territory, suggesting short-term hesitation, the MACD has turned positive, indicating some upward momentum is building. Bitcoin price analysis. Credit: crypto.news Bitcoin is currently trading above all of its major moving averages, which typically denotes an overall upward trend and implies that any declines may quickly find support. A slight widening of the Bollinger Bands suggests that price volatility may increase soon. Traders are keeping an eye on whether Bitcoin can break through resistance at $110,300 or if it will drop below support at $107,100. For the time being, the declining dollar creates favorable conditions for a possible Bitcoin rally. However, the speed at which traders take action may determine whether history repeats itself.

According to a July 8 press release , the entertainment and technology company has launched an Ethereum ( ETH ) treasury strategy. The company kicked off the move with an $8 million underwritten public offering, with most of the capital set to flow directly into Ethereum yield opportunities. For the long term, GameSquare’s board has approved up to $100 million in ETH allocations, to be deployed gradually while preserving enough liquidity to fund its operations. The firm has also partnered with Swiss crypto investment firm Dialectic to generate returns on its holdings, using Medici, an automated Ethereum-native yield platform.

He added that the new treasury strategy will enhance financial flexibility and support a capital plan that is focused on continued ETH accumulation. GameSquare’s adoption comes as more public companies turn to Ethereum for long-term reserves. Another Nasdaq-listed firm, Bit Digital, recently disclosed it had gone all-in on Ether, selling off its entire Bitcoin ( BTC ) holdings to expand its ETH position. Similarly, SharpLink Gaming has been on an aggressive accumulation streak , building out its own Ethereum treasury reserve. The firm is now the world’s second-largest ETH holder, behind only the Ethereum Foundation. Following its announcement, GameSquare’s stock jumped roughly 60%, reflecting strong investor support for the shift. Meanwhile, the increased adoption is translating into price action for ETH. The asset trades around $2,625 at the time of writing, up 2.8% in the past 24 hours and nearly 7% on the week. While gains remain modest, current prices mark a decent recovery after several weeks of underperformance.

H100 Group AB, a Swedish health technology company focusing on longevity and AI-driven health services, has successfully closed two key funding rounds, raising around SEK 516 million (~$54M). The capital raise was done via a directed share issue (Tranche 6, issuing 27.17 million shares at SEK 6.38) and a directed convertible debenture issue (Tranche 7, SEK 342.3 million, conversion price SEK 8.48). The directed share issue diluted existing shareholders by about 10.1%, and if all convertible debentures from Tranche 7 are converted, it could cause an additional dilution of around 14.3%. Investors from these tranches also have rights to participate in a future Tranche 8, which will be another convertible debenture issuance with a conversion price set 33% higher than Tranche 7. The funds will support H100 Group’s Bitcoin Treasury Strategy, aimed at preserving capital and strengthening the balance sheet by investing in Bitcoin ( BTC ). You might also like: Swedish tech firm H100 Group gains nearly 40% on first Bitcoin treasury buy This latest funding follows a previous agreement announced in June, where H100 secured a SEK 150 million (approx. $15.82 million) convertible loan guarantee from Blockstream CEO Adam Back to accelerate its BTC accumulation. That deal built on an earlier raise in May , where H100 brought in SEK 21 million ($2.2 million) through 0% interest convertible loans—also led by Back, alongside other investors such as Morten Klein and Crafoord Capital Partners. Including all previous raises, total capital secured to date amounts to SEK 921 million (approximately $96 million). H100’s aggressive fundraising for Bitcoin appears fueled by its initial $490,000 purchase of 4.39 BTC in May, which sent shares up nearly 40% , prompting the company to double down on its crypto treasury strategy. According to BitcoinTreasuries , H100 currently holds 247.5 BTC on its balance sheet.

2025-07-09T09:15:38,"‘Big Short’ Investor Steve Eisman Says US Budget Deficit ‘Nothing To Talk About’ Due to Insatiable Demand for Treasuries","One of the investors who called and profited off the subprime mortgage collapse of 2008, Steve Eisman, is brushing off concerns over the rising US budget deficit. In a new interview on CNBC, the Wall Street investor says the heavy demand for US treasuries from across the globe suggests there’s no cause for worry over the deficit. “There’s a great slogan that I think really applies to politics and international affairs, which is when someone tells you who they are, believe them. But in the market, when someone tells you who they are, don’t believe them [until when] they actually do something with their money. So all the people who are pontificating about this… The price of this risk is a 10-year Treasury yield. And what’s happened to the 10-year Treasury yield? It’s been directionless since December of 2022. So the more important question is given that all these people are pontificating about it, why hasn’t it moved? And again, I think the reason is there’s no alternative to Treasuries. If there was a real alternative to Treasuries, then all of this stuff about the deficit is something that I would pay attention to. But as long as there’s no alternative, there’s nothing to talk about.” Eisman also says the demand for US bonds all over the world is “insatiable” and that he believes investors will always show up in Treasury auctions to accumulate government debt. Late last month, Eisman said he was optimistic about the stock market due to the long-term growth potential of the US economy. “We’ve been in a bull market pretty much for the last 10 years with some fits and starts. And so buy the dip has become almost a religion. It’s a religion that right now I largely subscribe to because I am of the view… that the US economy is more dynamic than it’s ever been in my lifetime. So long term, I am very bullish.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-09T09:10:37,"New Zealand bans Crypto ATMs and limit international cash transfers","As part of new anti-money laundering policy changes, New Zealand declares a ban on cryptocurrency ATMs. Nicole McKee, the associate justice minister, announced more stringent enforcement actions aimed at financial crime. The goal of the government is to stop criminals from turning cash into cryptocurrency assets. Current global data shows 38,537 crypto ATMs operating across 67 countries worldwide. New Zealand targets crypto ATM operations under AML reforms As part of extensive anti-money laundering efforts, New Zealand intends to outlaw cryptocurrency ATMs. Nicole McKee, an associate justice minister, announced the ban on illegal cash conversion. The ban aims to prevent criminals from converting physical cash into cryptocurrencies. Cabinet agreed to introduce legislation strengthening enforcement powers for police and regulators. The new bill focuses on cracking down on money laundering operations across financial sectors. A new financial sanctions supervisory regime will be established under the reforms. The government will set a $5,000 upper limit on international cash transfers per transaction. This restriction reduces criminal organizations’ ability to move funds offshore through cash channels. The limit applies to all international money transfer services operating in New Zealand. Current global data shows 38,537 crypto ATMs operate worldwide across 67 countries. Other services number 235,581 locations with 41 producers and 349 operators managing the network. New Zealand’s ban contrasts with the global expansion of crypto ATM infrastructure. The ability to request information from banks will be expanded for the Financial Intelligence Unit. Businesses subject to AML/CFT Act must provide ongoing data on persons of interest. The FIU can also request contextual information from other businesses regarding financial activities. These measures target criminals while maintaining focus on legitimate business operations without excessive compliance burdens. Government balances crime prevention with business efficiency The New Zealand government aims to create one of the easiest places for legitimate business operations. For lower-risk clients, Minister McKee described intentions to eliminate the need for address verification. Due diligence requirements for lower-risk trusts will also face relaxation under new policies. There are now two amendment measures in Parliament that will relieve businesses of onerous compliance obligations. The legislation delivers practical relief by the end of 2025 for affected sectors. Businesses can focus resources on actual risks rather than low-risk client paperwork. Since 2019, the global financial and regulatory landscape has shifted across multiple jurisdictions. New Zealand seeks a smarter and more agile AML/CFT system targeting criminal activities. The approach balances criminal prevention with efficient business operations for competitive advantage. Cryptocurrencies lack direct regulation as financial products in New Zealand. The government increased oversight through broader fintech and anti-money laundering legislation instead. Digital assets receive recognition as property for tax purposes rather than legal tender. The Taxation Act 2025 implements the OECD Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework requirements. Crypto asset service providers must report transaction data to Inland Revenue Department. Full implementation begins April 2026 with preparation and compliance underway during 2025. In order to guide the formulation of a new national strategy, targeted engagement with industry stakeholders will soon commence. The levy framework will also undergo consultation processes with affected business sectors. Global crypto ATM infrastructure shows widespread adoption patterns Worldwide crypto ATM data indicate 38,537 units deployed across 67 world countries. The network has 235,581 additional services enabling cash for cryptocurrency trading. 41 firms produce crypto ATM hardware with 349 operators managing deployments. The international infrastructure enables others to sell or purchase Bitcoin and other digital currencies. Cash-based transactions are suitable for individuals who do not have conventional banking relationships. Crypto ATMs connect the physical cash and digital asset worlds with automated transactions. Source: Coin ATM Radar New Zealand’s planned prohibition is contrary to global growth of crypto ATM networks. The majority of countries view the machines as legitimate parts of financial services infrastructure. The machines offer regulated entry points for cryptocurrency adoption in many jurisdictions. Crypto ATM companies have to comply with local anti-money laundering laws in the majority of markets. Transaction limits and identity verification procedures differ country by country and regulatory climate. In some places, full KYC is mandated, but others allow lower transactions anonymously. The New Zealand ban targets potential money laundering threats in cash-to-crypto transactions. Government officials are worried about criminals laundering illicit cash using ATMs to turn it into digital money. The ban aims to plug loopholes in the financial surveillance system.

2025-07-09T09:08:20,"Anthony Pompliano’s ProCap Appears Better Than Peers Based on the BTC HODLer's Own Data","Anthony Pompliano's ProCap , recently shared an update on its progress and valuation metrics. ProCap has entered into a $1 billion business combination agreement with Columbus Circle Capital Corp 1 (CCCM). As part of the deal, ProCap has raised over $750 million and already deployed more than $500 million to purchase bitcoin (BTC), amassing a treasury of 4,950 BTC. This makes ProCap, the 13th largest public holder of bitcoin globally. The data and analysis presented by Pompliano comes directly from ProCap and refer to implied multiple Net Asset Value (mNAV) premiums. According to ProCap’s analysis, the company’s stock is currently trading at the lowest implied mNAV premium among a group of bitcoin treasury companies, at 1.3x, compared to peers like Cantor Equity Partners (CEP) at 2.2x. This low mNAV multiple suggests ProCap BTC LLC could be undervalued relative to other bitcoin treasury firms. A significant feature of the proposed business combination is the redemption right for CCCM shareholders. Investors who hold CCCM stock as of the record date for the special meeting to approve the business combination will have the right to redeem their shares for the cash held in trust. As of the closing of CCCM’s initial public offering in May, this pro rata trust value is anticipated to be about $10 per share. The maximum loss for investors is approximately 55 cents per share if the trust value holds at around $10 according to Pompliano. However, if ProCap implied mNAV premium rises to match that of Cantor Equity Partners (2.2x), the post-deal stock price could reach about $17.82 per share.

2025-07-09T09:00:52,"Mt. Gox Stolen BTC Under Alarming Attack: Billions Targeted by Hackers","BitcoinWorld Mt. Gox Stolen BTC Under Alarming Attack: Billions Targeted by Hackers The cryptocurrency world is once again on high alert as alarming reports surface about sophisticated hacking attempts targeting one of the most infamous caches of digital wealth: the Mt. Gox stolen BTC . This isn’t just about a few misplaced tokens; we’re talking about billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin that hackers are desperately trying to seize from an old, critical address. The sheer scale of this threat underscores the persistent vulnerabilities in the digital asset landscape and serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing battle against cybercriminals. The Alarming Threat to Mt. Gox Stolen BTC Imagine a treasure chest holding over $8 billion in digital gold, lying dormant but under constant surveillance by malicious actors. This is precisely the situation with the Bitcoin (BTC) address associated with the defunct Mt. Gox exchange. According to a recent research report by BitMEX, cited by Decrypt, hackers are actively targeting this specific address, attempting to gain unauthorized access to its vast reserves. The Mt. Gox stolen BTC saga is a notorious chapter in crypto history, and the continued attempts to exploit its remnants highlight the long memory and persistent nature of cybercriminals in the blockchain space. These aren’t random attacks; they are calculated, well-researched efforts aimed at a colossal payout. The original theft from Mt. Gox, which occurred nearly a decade ago, remains one of the largest cryptocurrency heists ever recorded. While efforts have been ongoing to reimburse creditors, the bulk of the stolen funds have largely remained untouched, held in addresses that are now under intense scrutiny. The current targeting of these addresses signifies a new phase of this long-running drama, bringing fresh concerns about the security of large, dormant cryptocurrency holdings. This development serves as a critical warning for anyone holding significant amounts of crypto in older, less frequently accessed wallets. Unpacking the Bitcoin Address Hack Mechanics How exactly are these sophisticated attackers attempting to breach such a heavily scrutinized target? BitMEX’s report sheds light on their primary tactic: highly deceptive phishing. The attackers sent a phishing link directly to the target Bitcoin address , cleverly disguised as the official website of Salomon Brothers. For those unfamiliar, Salomon Brothers was a prominent, albeit now defunct, Wall Street investment bank. This choice of disguise is particularly cunning, aiming to lend an air of legitimacy and financial gravitas to the fraudulent scheme. It’s a clear indication that these attackers are not only technically adept but also possess a deep understanding of social engineering and historical financial contexts. The mechanics of such a phishing attack typically involve tricking the recipient into revealing sensitive information, such as private keys, seed phrases, or login credentials, by clicking on a malicious link. While a direct attack on a cold storage address is complex, the goal might be to exploit any potential vulnerability in the associated infrastructure or to trick individuals with access to these funds. BitMEX also noted that these exploiters have broadened their scope, targeting multiple addresses created as far back as 2011. This suggests a systematic approach to identifying and attempting to compromise old, high-value Bitcoin wallets, likely belonging to early adopters or entities that accumulated significant BTC in the early days of the network. The sophistication of these methods underscores the need for extreme vigilance, especially for entities or individuals managing large, historical crypto holdings. The attackers are patient and innovative, constantly evolving their tactics to bypass existing security measures. BitMEX Research Uncovers Sophisticated Phishing Attacks Crypto The detailed insights into these malicious activities come courtesy of a recent research report from BitMEX, a leading cryptocurrency derivatives exchange. Their proactive investigation into these threats provides invaluable intelligence for the wider crypto community. BitMEX’s findings confirm that these aren’t isolated incidents but part of a coordinated campaign leveraging advanced social engineering techniques. The use of a seemingly legitimate, historical financial institution like Salomon Brothers as a front for these phishing attacks crypto highlights a new level of cunning in the cybercriminal playbook. BitMEX’s analysis likely involved monitoring suspicious network activity, analyzing on-chain transactions, and tracing the origins of these malicious links. Their report serves as a crucial warning, not just to the direct targets but to anyone involved in the cryptocurrency space. It emphasizes that even addresses holding funds for over a decade are not immune to determined attackers. The report’s implications extend beyond the Mt. Gox case, suggesting that any large, publicly known Bitcoin address could potentially become a target for similar highly tailored phishing or social engineering attacks. The continuous monitoring and reporting by entities like BitMEX are vital for maintaining the overall security posture of the decentralized ecosystem. By exposing these sophisticated tactics, they empower users and institutions to better protect their assets and stay one step ahead of evolving threats. Understanding Broader Crypto Security Threats The Mt. Gox incident, while specific, is a stark reminder of the broader landscape of crypto security threats that plague the digital asset space. Beyond direct phishing attempts on individual addresses, the ecosystem faces a myriad of dangers: Exchange Hacks: Centralized exchanges remain prime targets due to the large volume of funds they hold. While security has improved, vulnerabilities can still be exploited. Smart Contract Exploits: For decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, flaws in smart contract code can lead to massive losses, as seen in numerous flash loan attacks and re-entrancy bugs. Wallet Vulnerabilities: Software and hardware wallets, while generally secure, can be compromised through malware, supply chain attacks, or user error. Rug Pulls and Scams: New projects, particularly in the DeFi and NFT sectors, often turn out to be elaborate scams where developers abandon the project and abscond with investor funds. Malware and Ransomware: Malicious software designed to steal private keys or encrypt data until a ransom is paid in cryptocurrency. Social Engineering: Beyond phishing, this includes tactics like impersonation, baiting, and pretexting to manipulate individuals into revealing sensitive information or performing actions against their interest. The constant evolution of these threats necessitates a proactive and multi-layered approach to security. Users and institutions must remain vigilant, constantly update their knowledge, and adopt best practices to mitigate risks. The inherent transparency of blockchain, while a strength, also means that large, identifiable targets are always visible to potential attackers. Safeguarding Your Assets: Actionable Insights from BitMEX and Beyond Given the escalating sophistication of attacks like those targeting the Mt. Gox funds, what can individuals and institutions do to protect their valuable digital assets? The insights gleaned from reports like BitMEX’s underscore the importance of robust security practices. Here are some actionable steps: Verify Everything: Always double-check URLs, email senders, and the legitimacy of any request for information. Assume everything is a potential phishing attempt until proven otherwise. If a link seems suspicious, manually type the official website address into your browser. Hardware Wallets are Key: For significant holdings, use a reputable hardware wallet (e.g., Ledger, Trezor). These devices keep your private keys offline, making them significantly harder for online attackers to access. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Enable MFA on all your crypto accounts, especially exchanges. Use strong, unique passwords for each account. Be Wary of Unsolicited Communications: Legitimate entities will rarely ask for your private keys or seed phrase. Be extremely suspicious of emails, messages, or calls requesting this information. Regular Software Updates: Keep your operating system, browser, and crypto-related software up to date. Updates often include critical security patches. Educate Yourself: Stay informed about the latest scam techniques and security best practices. Follow reputable crypto security experts and news sources. Cold Storage for Large Sums: For very large amounts, consider true cold storage solutions, where private keys are generated and stored entirely offline, with no internet connectivity. Test Transactions: When sending large amounts, always send a small test transaction first to ensure the address is correct and the transaction goes through as expected. The lesson from the Mt. Gox targeting is clear: no amount of dormancy or historical significance makes a crypto address immune to determined cybercriminals. Vigilance, education, and the adoption of strong security protocols are your best defense in this evolving digital landscape. The ongoing attempts by hackers to target the Mt. Gox stolen BTC underscore a critical reality in the cryptocurrency world: the battle for digital security is perpetual. With billions of dollars at stake, these sophisticated phishing campaigns, as highlighted by BitMEX research, serve as a potent reminder that vigilance is paramount. From cunning disguises like the Salomon Brothers website to targeting old, high-value addresses, cybercriminals are constantly innovating their methods. As the crypto market matures, so too do the threats it faces. Protecting your assets requires a proactive approach, constant education, and adherence to robust security practices. The future of digital finance hinges on our collective ability to outmaneuver these persistent adversaries and safeguard the integrity of the blockchain ecosystem.
