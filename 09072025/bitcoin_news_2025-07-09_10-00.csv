2025-07-09T07:50:03,"Pioneering Bitcoin Service: Bow Valley Credit Union Transforms Crypto Banking in Canada","BitcoinWorld Pioneering Bitcoin Service: Bow Valley Credit Union Transforms Crypto Banking in Canada In a groundbreaking move that signals a significant shift in the Canadian financial landscape, Bow Valley Credit Union (BVCU), a prominent financial institution based in Alberta, has unveiled the country’s first-ever “Bitcoin Gateway.” This innovative Bitcoin service empowers BVCU members to directly purchase Bitcoin (BTC) using Canadian dollars through their existing credit union accounts. This development, announced via a Business Wire press release, marks a pivotal moment for traditional financial institutions venturing into the world of digital assets. The initiative was brought to fruition through strategic collaborations with Balance, a leading BTC custodian, and Bull Bitcoin, an API provider known for its robust cryptocurrency solutions. This strategic integration by a Canadian credit union is not just a technological upgrade; it’s a bold statement about the future of finance, blending the reliability of conventional banking with the innovation of cryptocurrency. What Does This Revolutionary Bitcoin Service Entail? The core of BVCU’s new offering is its “Bitcoin Gateway,” a seamless integration that allows members to interact with Bitcoin without leaving their familiar banking environment. Traditionally, purchasing Bitcoin involved navigating third-party exchanges, often requiring separate accounts, verification processes, and transfers between banks and crypto platforms. BVCU’s solution simplifies this significantly, offering unparalleled convenience and security. Direct Account Access: Members can initiate Bitcoin purchases directly from their BVCU accounts, treating BTC much like any other investment product or currency exchange. Canadian Dollar Transactions: All transactions are conducted in Canadian dollars, eliminating the need for foreign exchange conversions often associated with international crypto platforms. Enhanced Security: By partnering with Balance, a regulated and trusted Bitcoin custodian, BVCU ensures that members’ digital assets are held securely, mitigating risks often associated with self-custody or less regulated exchanges. Simplified User Experience: The goal is to make acquiring Bitcoin as straightforward as paying a bill or transferring funds online, removing common barriers to entry for new crypto users. This initiative represents a significant step towards mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies, especially for those who have been hesitant due to perceived complexities or security concerns. For a Bow Valley Credit Union member, it means embracing the future of finance with the confidence that their institution is leading the way. Why Is This a Game Changer for Canadian Credit Unions and Crypto Banking? BVCU’s pioneering move carries profound implications for the broader financial sector in Canada and beyond. It challenges the traditional reluctance of banks and credit unions to engage with cryptocurrencies, setting a precedent for how established financial institutions can adapt to the digital asset revolution. For Canadian credit unions, this opens a new frontier: First-Mover Advantage: BVCU has positioned itself as an innovator, potentially attracting new members who are keen on crypto but prefer the security and familiarity of a regulated financial institution. Meeting Member Demand: As interest in Bitcoin grows, credit unions face increasing pressure to offer relevant services. BVCU is directly addressing this demand, preventing members from seeking these services elsewhere. Regulatory Clarity: By working with partners like Balance and Bull Bitcoin, BVCU is navigating the complex regulatory landscape for crypto banking, potentially paving a clearer path for others to follow. Diversification of Services: Integrating Bitcoin allows credit unions to expand their service offerings, moving beyond traditional loans and deposits into the burgeoning digital asset space. This initiative demonstrates that traditional finance and digital assets are not mutually exclusive but can indeed converge to create a more comprehensive and user-friendly financial ecosystem. It’s a testament to the forward-thinking approach of Bow Valley Credit Union. Seamlessly Buy Bitcoin Canada: Benefits for Members The primary beneficiaries of BVCU’s new Bitcoin Gateway are its members. The service addresses several pain points associated with cryptocurrency acquisition, making it more accessible and secure for the average Canadian. Here’s how members stand to benefit: Unprecedented Convenience: No more linking external bank accounts to crypto exchanges or waiting for interbank transfers. The entire process to buy Bitcoin Canada is integrated within their existing banking interface. Enhanced Security and Trust: Members are dealing directly with their trusted credit union, which in turn partners with regulated entities like Balance for custody. This significantly reduces the risk of scams, hacks, or mismanaged funds often associated with less reputable platforms. Simplified Compliance: The credit union handles much of the regulatory compliance (KYC/AML), ensuring that transactions adhere to Canadian financial laws without burdening the individual member with complex procedures. Financial Inclusion: For individuals who might find standalone crypto exchanges intimidating, this integrated service provides a familiar and safe entry point into the digital asset economy. Access to Financial Innovation: Members can participate in the growing digital asset market, potentially diversifying their portfolios and exploring new investment opportunities with the backing of their financial institution. This strategic move by Bow Valley Credit Union is a clear signal that mainstream finance is ready to embrace the future, making it easier for Canadians to participate in the global Bitcoin economy. Challenges and Opportunities for Mainstream Crypto Banking Adoption While BVCU’s move is commendable, the path to widespread crypto banking integration is not without its challenges. These include regulatory hurdles, technological complexities, and the need for significant customer education. Challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty: Despite recent clarifications, the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies remains dynamic. Financial institutions must continuously adapt to evolving rules and guidelines. Technological Integration: Seamlessly integrating blockchain technology with legacy banking systems is a complex undertaking, requiring robust APIs, secure data management, and continuous maintenance. Security Risks: While BVCU mitigates this through a trusted custodian, managing digital assets inherently carries unique security risks, including cyberattacks and sophisticated scams. Customer Education: Many traditional banking customers may lack understanding of Bitcoin and its volatility. Credit unions must invest in educating their members to ensure responsible engagement. Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s price volatility can be a concern for conservative financial institutions and their members. Managing expectations and providing clear disclaimers are crucial. Opportunities: New Revenue Streams: Offering crypto services can unlock new fee-based revenue streams for credit unions. Competitive Differentiation: Being an early adopter provides a significant competitive edge, attracting tech-savvy younger demographics and existing members seeking modern financial solutions. Innovation Leadership: Institutions that embrace crypto position themselves as leaders in financial innovation, enhancing their brand reputation. Future-Proofing: As digital assets become more integral to the global economy, integrating them now prepares financial institutions for the future of finance. The decision by this Canadian credit union highlights a willingness to navigate these challenges for the immense opportunities that lie ahead in the realm of Bitcoin services. The Broader Landscape: Will Other Canadian Credit Unions Follow BVCU’s Lead? BVCU’s initiative sets a powerful precedent. The question now is whether other financial institutions, particularly other Canadian credit unions and even major banks, will follow suit. The pressure to innovate and cater to evolving customer demands is mounting. Several factors could influence this: Regulatory Comfort: As regulators provide clearer guidelines, more institutions will feel comfortable entering the space. Technological Partnerships: The availability of reliable and secure third-party solutions, like those provided by Balance and Bull Bitcoin, makes integration more feasible. Customer Demand: Increasing member inquiries and the desire to buy Bitcoin Canada easily will push institutions to act. Competitive Pressure: No financial institution wants to be left behind while competitors capture new market segments. This pioneering step by Bow Valley Credit Union could well be the spark that ignites a broader trend, making integrated crypto banking a standard offering across Canada’s financial sector. Actionable Insights: What This Means for You and the Future of Finance For individuals and institutions alike, BVCU’s Bitcoin Gateway offers valuable insights and potential pathways forward. For Individual Members: Explore the Service: If you are a BVCU member interested in Bitcoin, take advantage of this convenient and secure service to buy Bitcoin Canada. Educate Yourself: Even with simplified access, understanding Bitcoin’s fundamentals, risks, and potential rewards is crucial. Start Small: Consider starting with smaller amounts to get comfortable with the process and market dynamics. For Other Financial Institutions: Assess Demand: Gauge your members’ interest in cryptocurrency services. Research Partnerships: Explore collaborations with established crypto custodians and API providers to leverage their expertise and infrastructure for a secure Bitcoin service. Engage with Regulators: Proactively work with regulatory bodies to understand compliance requirements and contribute to shaping future policies for crypto banking. Prioritize Security: Any venture into crypto must put robust security measures and reliable custody solutions at the forefront. The move by Bow Valley Credit Union is a blueprint for how traditional finance can embrace innovation responsibly. The Future is Here: Bridging Traditional and Digital Finance The launch of BVCU’s Bitcoin Gateway is more than just a new product offering; it represents a significant step in the ongoing convergence of traditional finance and the decentralized world of cryptocurrencies. It signifies a future where accessing digital assets is as straightforward and secure as any other banking transaction. This integration enhances accessibility, reduces friction, and builds trust, which are critical for mainstream adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. As the digital economy continues to evolve, the ability of financial institutions to adapt and innovate will determine their relevance. BVCU has demonstrated remarkable foresight and courage in becoming the first Canadian credit union to offer such a direct Bitcoin service, setting a high bar for others to follow. This initiative paves the way for a more integrated, efficient, and accessible financial system for all Canadians.

2025-07-09T07:40:00,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Unveiling Market Optimism in the Greed Zone","BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Unveiling Market Optimism in the Greed Zone The cryptocurrency world is abuzz! The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a popular barometer for understanding market psychology, has recently climbed to a significant 66, firmly planting itself in the ‘Greed’ zone. This upward movement, up one point from the previous day as of July 9, suggests a palpable shift in crypto market sentiment . But what exactly does this number tell us, and how should investors interpret this wave of optimism? Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: What Does it Measure? At its core, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index aims to distill the complex emotions driving the cryptocurrency market into a single, digestible number. Developed by Alternative, a software development platform, this index ranges from 0 to 100. A score of 0 screams “extreme fear,” often indicating potential buying opportunities as investors panic sell. Conversely, a score of 100 shouts “extreme greed,” which might signal an impending correction as the market becomes overbought. The current reading of 66 sits squarely in the ‘Greed’ territory, suggesting that optimism, and perhaps a touch of irrational exuberance, is currently prevalent among participants. How is Investor Sentiment Calculated? A Look at Key Factors Understanding how the index arrives at its score is crucial for any investor seeking to gauge investor sentiment accurately. The index doesn’t rely on a single metric but rather a blend of six distinct factors, each weighted to contribute to the final reading. These factors provide a holistic view of the market’s psychological state: Volatility (25%): This component measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average over the last 30 and 90 days. High volatility often signals fear, while stable markets can foster greed. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This factor analyzes the current volume and market momentum, comparing it to the last 30 and 90-day averages. High buying volumes and strong momentum typically indicate a greedy market. Social Media (15%): The index scans Twitter hashtags and Reddit posts for crypto-related terms, analyzing the speed and number of posts. A surge in positive sentiment or overly optimistic discussions can push the index towards greed. Surveys (15%): This component, though currently paused, involves polling a large group of crypto investors weekly to gather their direct sentiment about the market. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Bitcoin dominance refers to Bitcoin’s market cap share relative to the total crypto market cap. A rising dominance often suggests investors are moving into Bitcoin, perceived as a safer asset, which can indicate fear in altcoins. Conversely, falling dominance can signal a risk-on environment where altcoins are gaining traction, often associated with greed. Google Trends (10%): This factor analyzes Google search queries related to cryptocurrencies. A spike in searches for “Bitcoin price manipulation” or “crypto crash” might indicate fear, while searches for “how to buy Bitcoin” during a bull run could signal greed. Navigating the ‘Greed’ Zone: What Does High Crypto Market Sentiment Mean for You? When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index hovers in the ‘Greed’ zone, as it is now at 66, it suggests that investors are generally optimistic and perhaps becoming overconfident. Historically, periods of extreme greed can precede market corrections, as assets become overvalued. However, it’s also true that bull runs can extend for significant periods, with the index remaining in ‘Greed’ for weeks or even months. This elevated crypto market sentiment indicates that many are expecting further price appreciation. For investors, this current reading presents both opportunities and risks. On one hand, strong positive sentiment can fuel continued upward price action, especially for Bitcoin and major altcoins. On the other hand, it’s a time for caution. The adage “be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful” often rings true in crypto. While not a precise timing tool, a high ‘Greed’ score serves as a reminder to reassess your portfolio, consider profit-taking on over-extended assets, and avoid impulsive decisions driven by FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). Understanding Market Volatility: A Constant Companion in Crypto One of the most significant factors influencing the index is market volatility . The crypto market is notorious for its rapid price swings, and these movements directly impact the ‘Volatility’ component of the index. High volatility can stem from various sources: macroeconomic news, regulatory announcements, major hacks, or even large institutional buys/sells. When the market experiences sharp, unpredictable movements, it often triggers fear, pushing the index lower. Conversely, a period of relatively stable upward movement, even if prices are rising, might contribute to a sense of calm optimism that translates into greed. Staying informed about the causes of volatility can help you better anticipate shifts in the index and overall market sentiment. The Strategic Role of Bitcoin Dominance in Market Dynamics The Bitcoin dominance metric, though only 10% of the index’s weighting, plays a strategic role in reflecting broader market dynamics. When Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap increases, it often indicates that investors are seeking refuge in what they perceive as the most secure and established cryptocurrency. This flight to safety usually happens during periods of uncertainty or fear, as capital flows out of riskier altcoins. Conversely, when Bitcoin dominance declines, it often signals a “altcoin season,” where capital flows from Bitcoin into various altcoins, driven by higher risk appetite and the pursuit of greater returns. This shift is typically associated with a greedy market, as investors become more confident in exploring higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities across the altcoin spectrum. Conclusion: Navigating the Market with Informed Investor Sentiment The Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 66, firmly in the ‘Greed’ zone, is a clear indicator of prevailing optimism in the crypto market. While it’s not a crystal ball for future prices, it offers invaluable insights into collective investor sentiment . By understanding its components—from market volatility and momentum to social media trends and Bitcoin dominance —investors can gain a more nuanced perspective beyond just price charts. This index serves as a powerful reminder to approach the market with a balanced perspective, leveraging periods of heightened greed for strategic re-evaluation and ensuring you’re not swept away by emotional trading. Use this tool as part of a broader analytical framework to make more informed and rational investment decisions in the dynamic world of digital assets.

2025-07-09T07:37:25,"CRO price posts 20% single-day rally on inclusion in Trump Media-backed ETF, eyes $0.105","CRO price staged a powerful rally Tuesday, climbing over 20% after news broke of its inclusion in a proposed Trump Media-backed Blue Chip ETF, sparking renewed bullish momentum for the embattled token. Cronos ( CRO ) surged over 20% on Tuesday after Trump Media and Technology Group filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a Blue Chip ETF that includes CRO alongside Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), Solana ( SOL ), and Ripple ( XRP ). Notably, Cronos received a 5% allocation, which is more than Ripple’s 2%. If approved, the ETF will be listed on NYSE Arca and its assets will be custodied by Foris DAX Trust Company, Crypto.com’s custody arm. The news sparked a sharp breakout, sending CRO price from its July 8 open at $0.081 to an intraday high of $0.10, breaking above a descending trendline and out of the recent consolidation range. The rally pushed the price through key moving averages and briefly tested a previous swing-high resistance. It also approached the 200-day SMA, now acting as its dynamic resistance. As of now, CRO price has pulled back slightly, trading around $0.092, just above the horizontal support near $0.089–0.090. This area, which previously acted as resistance in late April – early May, is now being retested as support following the breakout. Holding this level would be bullish, confirming a successful retest and setting up for a potential move back toward the $0.101 (200-day SMA) and $0.105 resistance zone.

2025-07-09T07:34:25,"This Overlooked Binance Metric Might Predict Bitcoin’s Next Major Move","Bitcoin has mostly traded between $105,000 and $110,000 this month, hovering near its all-time high. Yet on Binance, perpetual futures prices continue to lag behind spot prices. The continued negative Spot-Perpetual Price Delta on Binance since December 2024 reveals a structural imbalance. Spot Leads, Futures Lags In its latest analysis, CryptoQuant explained that this negative delta indicates the spot price of Bitcoin has consistently traded above perpetual futures prices. This means that the current rally is being driven largely by spot buyers rather than leveraged futures traders on Binance. When the delta initially flipped from positive to negative in December, Bitcoin reached its then-all-time high, with aggressive long positioning on Binance’s perpetual markets, while the spot price trailed. Even after BTC’s decline to $74,000 and subsequent recovery to a new peak, the delta has remained negative. Such a trend highlights that perpetual markets are still not fully participating in the upside momentum. This behavior could reflect a cautious environment among leveraged traders, which could mean that the market is in an accumulation phase where supply is absorbed gradually by spot buyers before a potential continuation of the rally. Importantly, the current structure implies a healthier rally as it is not being driven by excessive leverage, which reduces the risk of sharp liquidations that can destabilize the price. However, a flip in the delta from negative to positive would signal an influx of leveraged longs, as it is often a precursor to local tops or corrections, since liquidity becomes an attractive target for market makers and whales. As such, while spot demand remains strong, the market’s next phase will likely be defined by how and when Binance’s perpetual markets catch up, with the delta acting as a key signal for potential volatility ahead. Accumulation by Institutions Against this backdrop of spot-driven strength on Binance, Bitfinex Alpha’s latest report revealed that bulls are maintaining structural control. Bitcoin has defended the short-term holders’ realized price of $98,220, hinting at constructive bullish momentum even amid volatility. The rising STH cost basis near $99,474 indicates continued accumulation by newer participants. This includes institutions via ETFs. Meanwhile, whales are distributing holdings and have offloaded over 14,000 BTC since June 30, while retail and institutions absorb supply, thereby driving momentum amid macro uncertainty and equity market strength.

U.S. President Donald Trump has revealed via Truth Social that a pivotal July 9 Announcement is set to disclose critical trade decisions affecting at least seven countries, with more details to follow throughout the day. While the cryptocurrency market often dances to its own tune, macro-economic shifts and geopolitical moves, like the upcoming Trump Trade Policy unveilings, undeniably ripple through all financial sectors, including digital assets. Understanding these broader economic currents is vital for any investor, making this announcement a must-watch event. What is the Trump Trade Policy All About? To grasp the potential ramifications of the upcoming announcements, it’s essential to recall the core tenets of the Trump Trade Policy . During his previous term, President Trump championed an “America First” approach, often characterized by a willingness to impose tariffs and renegotiate existing trade agreements. The underlying philosophy was to protect American industries and jobs, reduce trade deficits, and ensure what he perceived as fair trade practices. This often led to: Bilateral Negotiations: A preference for one-on-one deals rather than multilateral agreements. Tariff Imposition: Strategic use of tariffs on imported goods, particularly from countries deemed to be engaging in unfair trade practices. Re-evaluation of Existing Deals: Renegotiating or withdrawing from agreements like NAFTA (which became USMCA) and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). This approach often created friction with major trading partners but also resulted in new agreements. The upcoming July 9 Announcement suggests a continuation, or perhaps an escalation, of this assertive stance, setting the stage for renewed discussions around global commerce. How Will This Impact Global Trade Dynamics? The disclosure of new trade decisions, especially concerning multiple countries, has the potential to significantly alter Global Trade dynamics. When a major economic power like the United States adjusts its trade stance, it creates a cascade of effects. Countries facing new tariffs or restrictions might retaliate, leading to trade wars that disrupt supply chains and increase costs for consumers. Conversely, countries that are favored could see increased trade volumes and economic benefits. Here’s how this could play out: Supply Chain Realignments: Businesses may need to find new suppliers or production locations to avoid tariffs, leading to costly and time-consuming adjustments. Price Fluctuations: Tariffs typically increase the cost of imported goods, which can be passed on to consumers, potentially fueling inflation. Shifting Alliances: Countries might seek new trade partners or strengthen existing alliances to mitigate the impact of U.S. decisions. The specific countries named on July 9 will dictate the immediate impact, but the broader message will resonate across all international markets, influencing everything from commodity prices to manufacturing strategies. What is the Potential Economic Impact? The direct and indirect Economic Impact of these trade decisions could be far-reaching. For businesses, changes in trade policy mean a re-evaluation of strategies, potential restructuring, and navigating new regulatory landscapes. For consumers, it could mean higher prices or reduced availability of certain goods. Let’s consider some key areas: Sector/Area Potential Impact Considerations Manufacturing Increased costs for imported raw materials; potential for reshoring production if tariffs make imports too expensive. Job creation in some areas, but higher consumer prices due to increased domestic production costs. Retail & Consumer Goods Higher prices on imported goods, reduced consumer purchasing power. Shift towards domestically produced alternatives, if available. Agriculture Vulnerability to retaliatory tariffs from affected countries, impacting exports. Government subsidies or new market exploration may be needed. Technology Impact on supply chains for electronics components; potential for restrictions on tech transfers. Innovation could be stifled or accelerated depending on the nature of restrictions. The Economic Impact is not uniform; some sectors may benefit from reduced foreign competition, while others could face significant headwinds. Investors will be closely watching for signals of inflationary pressure or shifts in corporate earnings reports linked to these changes. Navigating Future Trade Relations: Challenges and Opportunities? The upcoming announcement will undoubtedly reshape existing Trade Relations and potentially forge new ones. For the countries involved, the challenge will be to adapt quickly, whether through diplomatic engagement, economic diversification, or seeking new alliances. For the United States, the opportunity lies in reinforcing its economic leverage and potentially rebalancing what it perceives as unfair trade practices. Challenges: Diplomatic Strain: Unilateral trade actions can strain diplomatic ties, impacting cooperation on other global issues. Retaliation: Affected countries may impose their own tariffs or restrictions, leading to a cycle of escalation. Uncertainty: The lack of predictability in trade policy can deter long-term investment and planning for businesses. Opportunities: New Agreements: The pressure from tariffs can sometimes lead to more favorable trade agreements for the imposing country. Domestic Growth: Protecting domestic industries can stimulate local production and job creation. Strategic Realignments: It can force countries to diversify their economic partnerships, potentially strengthening new geopolitical blocs. The art of navigating these complex Trade Relations will be a defining feature of international diplomacy in the coming months. Why is the July 9 Announcement So Significant? The July 9 Announcement carries immense weight not just because of the decisions themselves, but because of the way they are being unveiled. A simultaneous disclosure involving at least seven countries signals a coordinated and assertive move by the U.S. administration. This isn’t a piecemeal adjustment but a comprehensive statement of intent regarding future Global Trade policy. The fact that more countries are expected to be named later in the day adds to the suspense and underscores the breadth of this policy shift. It creates an immediate need for businesses, governments, and investors worldwide to react and strategize, ensuring they are not caught off guard by the evolving landscape of Trade Relations . Actionable Insights for the Crypto Investor and Beyond While trade policy might seem distant from the world of digital assets, its Economic Impact is undeniable. Here’s how to think about it: Macroeconomic Sensitivity: Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, while sometimes uncorrelated, are increasingly influenced by macro-economic factors. Trade wars can lead to inflation, which some see as a catalyst for Bitcoin adoption, or conversely, economic downturns that reduce risk appetite across all asset classes. Currency Volatility: If trade decisions lead to significant volatility in fiat currencies, some investors might turn to stablecoins or even Bitcoin as a hedge, particularly in affected nations. Supply Chain Disruptions: If tariffs severely disrupt global supply chains, it could lead to increased interest in blockchain solutions for logistics and provenance, creating new use cases for certain crypto projects. Stay informed about the specifics of the July 9 Announcement . Monitor how traditional markets react, particularly indices related to manufacturing, exports, and imports. These shifts can provide clues about broader market sentiment that might eventually trickle down to crypto. Diversify your portfolio and consider how various economic scenarios might affect your digital asset holdings. Conclusion: An Evolving Global Economic Landscape The forthcoming July 9 Announcement from President Trump regarding trade decisions is more than just a news item; it’s a critical moment that could redefine Global Trade for years to come. With at least seven countries initially in focus, and more to follow, the implications for Economic Impact , Trade Relations , and the overall financial landscape are substantial. Businesses, governments, and investors, including those deeply invested in the crypto space, must pay close attention. The unfolding Trump Trade Policy will undoubtedly present both formidable challenges and unique opportunities, underscoring the interconnectedness of our global economy. Being prepared and understanding these shifts will be paramount for navigating the path ahead.

2025-07-09T07:18:31,"Why XRP Price is Not Surging?","The post Why XRP Price is Not Surging? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP was one of the biggest crypto winners after the U.S. election in 2024 , so why has the price stalled since then? Between November 5 and December 2, 2024, XRP surged an astonishing +445.15%, delivering a monthly return of +281.7% in November alone. However, despite major milestones like the SEC settlement and improved political outlook, XRP has since traded sideways, leaving many wondering what’s holding it back. This has raised serious concerns about XRP’s future among traders and analysts. Crypto analyst Jose Luis Cava pointed to Ripple’s tight control over XRP’s supply and market structure as major reasons behind the stagnation. XRP Market Analysis: A Closer Look In the past year, XRP has seen a remarkable growth of 436.6%, outperforming top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. One of the major catalysts behind this surge was the political shift in the U.S., which proved favorable to Ripple. In just the first 27 days after election day, XRP surged by at least 445.15%. The year 2025 has been significant for XRP. After a prolonged legal battle, Ripple settled with the SEC, paving the way for increased adoption and potential growth. But despite these developments, XRP has largely traded sideways since the post-election rally in November 2024. In terms of quarterly performance, Q1 2025 saw a modest return of +0.45%, a decline compared to Q1 2024’s +2.37%. The second quarter of 2025, however, showed improvement with a return of +7.12%, a stark contrast to the -25% return in Q2 2024. So far this quarter, the market has jumped by 4.08%, reaching $2.33. Ripple’s Control Over XRP: A Stumbling Block? Renowned cryptocurrency analyst Jose Luis Cava has alleged that XRP’s market behavior is heavily influenced by one dominant hand. He argues that such control restricts organic price action, making it difficult for the market to move naturally based on demand and supply. It’s a fact that a large portion of XRP is still held by Ripple Labs. Initially, the company controlled about 80% of all XRP tokens. Although that figure has decreased over time, Ripple still maintains significant control. As of now, around 35% of the total supply is held in monthly escrow, 7% is in Ripple’s direct wallets, and at least 2% is circulating under the company’s control. Institutional Demand Remains Low Even though XRP has outperformed BTC and ETH in recent yearly performance, it still lags in terms of institutional demand. Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to dominate due to their wide acceptance and massive institutional backing. For instance, the total market cap of U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs stands at $135.50 billion, while that of Ethereum spot ETFs is $9.01 billion. In contrast, XRP spot ETF applications are still pending with the SEC. While some leveraged XRP ETFs are available, a direct spot ETF has yet to be approved. Regulatory decisions are expected by late 2025. Many believe that XRP’s low institutional interest is rooted in concerns over its centralized control, uncertainty around banking partnerships, and lack of clear real-world use cases. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP News – Brad Garlinghouse Reveals Ripple’s 3 Demands for U.S. Crypto Regulation , The Dual-Ledger Controversy Adding to the debate is XRP’s dual-ledger system. XRP uses both a public XRP Ledger for retail users and a private, permissioned ledger tailored for central banks. This setup has triggered criticism, especially from crypto purists who see private ledgers as a threat to the core principles of decentralization and transparency. Although there are rumors that Ripple might merge both systems in the future, no official statement has been released confirming this plan. What’s Next for XRP? The XRP market is unlikely to break free from its current sideways pattern unless Ripple directly addresses user concerns. Key issues include transparency, real-world adoption, and centralization of token control. Experts suggest that the XRP community is looking for greater openness, stronger institutional use cases, and a shift towards decentralization before regaining confidence in the asset’s long-term growth potential. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Here Are The Details","Cryptocurrency exchange Binance announced that it will remove the “Monitoring Tag” and “Seed Tag” applications on some tokens as of July 9, 2025, as a result of its latest evaluations. Binance Removes Tracking Tag for ZEC, Seed Tag for ENA, PYTH, TAO, and W Token to Remove Tracking Tag: Zcash (ZEC) Tokens to be Seed Tag Removed: Ethena (ENA) Pyth Network (PYTH) Bittensor (TAO) Wormhole (W) Binance notes that tokens carrying a “Watch Tag” generally carry higher volatility and risk than other crypto assets. These tokens are subject to regular review and may be at risk of being removed from the platform. The “Seed Tag” identifies new and innovative projects, but these projects may also present high risk and volatility. The removal of labels indicates that the projects in question have better aligned with Binance’s listing criteria and their risk profile has decreased. Binance stated that it regularly reviews its labeling decisions based on the following criteria: Commitment of the project team Level and quality of development activities Trading volume and liquidity Network security and resilience to attacks Public communication, community engagement and transparency Responses to regular due diligence requests Findings of unethical or fraudulent activities New regulatory requirements Sudden increases in token supply or tokenomics changes Significant changes in project ownership or core team Community reactions With this update, the warning labels on ZEC, ENA, PYTH, TAO and W tokens will be removed, allowing investors to make clearer evaluations. *This is not investment advice.

Pseudonymous analyst Dave the Wave tells his 153,500 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin is flashing a bullish continuation pattern on the weekly chart, suggesting that a breakout surge is in sight for BTC. “BTC cup and handle anyone….? Some calling it an inverse head and shoulders [pattern], which is a possibility I sketched months ago. But if so, a veeeery weak right shoulder… And a weaker ‘shoulder’ makes sense at the top where the market is more bullish. A conventional inverse head and shoulders is usually to be found at the bottom of a market, not at the top. This is why I prefer to call it a cup and handle, a pattern often found at the top.” Source: Dave the Wave/X Earlier this year, the analyst predicted that Bitcoin would hit $160,000 before the end of the year. In a recent article snippet, Dave the Wave says that Bitcoin’s two-year uptrend appears sustainable, with each rally underpinned by consolidation phases that lay the groundwork for the next move higher. According to the analyst, Bitcoin now has the foundation for rallies to new all-time high prices. “The remarkable series of the moves up in price [only remarkable as compared to the parabolic moves of yester-year… while explicable in terms of a maturing market] and the subsequent consolidations has led to a situation that ever-higher prices are supported by the market. Price look to be more sustainable over an extended period of time at these elevated levels as compared to earlier markets where the making of all-time highs consisted in temporary spikes… In contrast to previous cycles, the higher the price has gone, the more stable it has become, suggestive of a maturing market.” Source: Dave the Wave/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $108,805.

Here’s what this could mean for the market. Bitcoin & Stablecoin Exchange Reserves Have Decoupled On Binance In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst has talked about the latest trend in the Binance Exchange Reserve for Bitcoin and the stablecoins. The “Exchange Reserve” here refers to an on-chain metric that keeps track of the total amount of a given asset that’s sitting on the wallets attached to a centralized exchange. When the value of this metric rises, it means the holders are making net deposits of the asset to the platform. Generally, investors use exchanges when they want to participate in trading activities, so them making inflows could signal appetite for trading the coin away. Related Reading: Ethereum ETF Inflows Hit 8-Week Streak—Institutions Still Buying For cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, this is something that can naturally have a bearish impact on the price. The same, however, isn’t true in the case of the stablecoins, as they are, by definition, always stable around the same value as the fiat currency that they are pegged to. Investors usually store their capital in the form of these tokens when they want to avoid the volatility associated with assets like Bitcoin. Many of them, however, plan to eventually return back to the volatile side. Once they have decided to make the switch, they transfer their stablecoins to exchanges. When they make the swap to a coin like Bitcoin, its price naturally observes a buying boost. As such, stablecoin inflows can be bullish for the volatile cryptocurrencies. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the Exchange Reserve of Binance for Bitcoin and the stablecoins over the last couple of years: As displayed in the above graph, the Binance Exchange Reserve for the two asset classes showed some correlation in 2024. But by the end of the year, a shift had occurred, with the stablecoins witnessing sharp inflows and Bitcoin outflows. The two have remained decoupled in 2025 so far, although their trends no longer diverge as extremely. The stablecoin Binance exchange reserve has recently been trending sideways, while the one for Bitcoin has rapidly been moving down.

BTC Price Bitcoin is holding steady as its price is still trading around the $108,800 level.

2025-07-09T07:00:14,"Bitcoin Breaking Out Of Descending Broadening Wedge – Can Bulls Push BTC To $144,000?","Over the past week, Bitcoin (BTC) has been seesawing within a narrow price range of $107,000 to $110,000, offering little clarity on the direction of its next major move. However, the latest technical analysis suggests that the flagship cryptocurrency may be on the verge of a breakout to the upside, potentially eyeing a new all-time high (ATH). Bitcoin Set To Clear Descending Broadening Wedge According to a recent X post by crypto trader Merlijn The Trader, Bitcoin appears poised to break out of a bullish descending broadening wedge pattern. The trader noted that if BTC can sustain support above the $104,000 level, it may target a potential high of $144,000. For the uninitiated, a descending broadening wedge is a bullish chart pattern formed by two diverging trendlines sloping downward, where price makes lower highs and lower lows over time. It suggests growing volatility and selling exhaustion, often leading to a breakout to the upside once resistance is broken. The following two-day chart shows BTC adhering to this pattern since early January 2025. A significant reversal occurred in April, when Bitcoin surged from a local low of around $76,000 to over $100,000 in just a few weeks. Meanwhile, fellow crypto analyst Ted Pillows shared a similar outlook. He shared the following weekly BTC chart, noting that Bitcoin just posted its highest-ever weekly close. He also highlighted that the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator has formed a bullish cross – similar to the setup in Q4 2024. To explain, MACD bullish cross occurs when the MACD line – short-term moving average – crosses above the signal line – longer-term moving average – signaling a potential shift from bearish to bullish momentum. This crossover is often seen as an early indicator of a price uptrend or buying opportunity. Bitcoin experienced strong price appreciation in Q4 2024, climbing from approximately $58,000 on October 6 to $108,000 by December 15. At the time, the rally was also fueled by renewed market optimism following Republican candidate Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election. BTC Price May Stall Temporarily While Bitcoin seems poised to set new ATHs in the near term, some analysts caution that a short pause in the uptrend may occur. For instance, seasoned analyst Ali Martinez observed that some long-term holders are beginning to take profits. Similarly, strong US employment data for June 2025 is likely to force the US Federal Reserve (Fed) to delay interest rate cuts, which may result in a temporary price pullback in risk-on assets, including BTC.

2025-07-09T06:57:46,"Tether CEO Says “We Will Be the Largest Bitcoin Miner by the End of 2025”","The post Tether CEO Says “We Will Be the Largest Bitcoin Miner by the End of 2025” appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin USDT, is gearing up for a dramatic shift in strategy. While regulatory pressure builds under the newly passed GENIUS Act in the U.S., CEO Paolo Ardoino has revealed bold plans to make Tether the largest Bitcoin miner in the world by the end of 2025. This comes alongside its efforts to launch a fully compliant U.S.-based stablecoin amid growing scrutiny. With the Senate passing the “Genius Act,” Paolo expressed optimism. He believes the legislation will create a global compliance framework for stablecoins, both domestic and foreign. Tether plans to align its current USDT token with these new standards and also launch a new onshore stablecoin tailored for the U.S. market. From Stablecoins to Mining Powerhouse Speaking on a recent Bankless podcast with Ryan Sean Adams, Ardoino shared that Tether is investing heavily in Bitcoin mining, alongside ventures in AI, telecommunications, and data centers. With over $10 billion in Bitcoin holdings, Ardoino stressed the importance of protecting the network that underpins Tether’s balance sheet. By becoming a top miner, Tether hopes to safeguard its interests from potential manipulation and centralization risks. Ardoino confidently stated, “Realistically, by the end of this year, Tether will become the biggest bitcoin miner out there.” The Billion-Dollar Mining Bet Despite strong competition from established mining giants like Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms, Tether has made significant progress through partnerships with Latin American governments, including El Salvador , Paraguay, and Uruguay. With over 15 mining facilities already under its belt, the company has quietly poured billions into expanding its mining infrastructure. Still, questions remain, as Tether has yet to disclose its share of the total Bitcoin hashrate. GENIUS Act Forces Strategic Changes While Tether aims to lead in mining, it’s also being forced to navigate new regulatory hurdles in the U.S. The GENIUS Act, passed in June 2025, demands full reserve backing, AML/KYC compliance, and transparency from all stablecoin issuers. Tether has 18 to 36 months to comply or face expulsion from the U.S. market. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Multiple International Companies Apply for Hong Kong’s Stablecoin Licensing , On the flip side, the company worked alongside the U.S. Department of Justice to help freeze illicit funds using its blockchain monitoring systems. He noted that Tether has collaborated with over 250 law enforcement agencies globally, an unmatched record in the crypto world. What’s Next? Tether must now choose between revamping USDT to meet U.S. standards, launching a new regulated stablecoin, or withdrawing from the American market. Meanwhile, competitors like USDC and RLUSD are primed to capitalize on any misstep. Overall, one thing is clear that Tether is no longer just a stablecoin issuer, but a major player betting big on Bitcoin’s infrastructure. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-09T06:49:35,"Are Bitcoin treasury companies a new bubble akin to the ICO boom? Critics and industry leaders see similarities","As Bitcoin treasury companies are becoming the new initial coin offerings, people are starting to remember how it all ended in 2018. While ICOs and Bitcoin treasury companies are definitely not the same, critics outline some similarities. More than that, recently, the CEO of the treasury company Nakamoto, David Bailey, compared his business to “the early day ICOs.” Calling something a bubble until it bursts may not be correct, but it is possible to point out similarities and differences between ICOs and treasuries to test the potential future of the latter. The rise of Bitcoin treasury companies MicroStrategy was founded in 1989, and since then, it has tested several grounds. Only in 2020 did MicroStrategy focus on issuing debt to buy bitcoin, promising its shareholders indirect exposure to owning BTC held by the company. In 2025, the company changed its name to Strategy. Strategy attracted attention. MSTR stock’s value has gained 500% since early 2024. Investors who don’t want or cannot (because of the laws) buy BTC directly but want to enjoy yield on growth opportunities. After Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 election and a new round of interest in Bitcoin, Bitcoin treasury companies began to emerge with ever-increasing speed. Multi-million dollar purchases of Bitcoin decrease BTC price volatility, creating increased demand for it. Strategy alone bought more Bitcoin in 2025 than miners produced. Such terms as “supply shock” and “opportunity cost” reflect how reluctant people become to sell any amount of BTC. Just like Strategy chair Michael Saylor is advocating for Bitcoin and Strategy online and offline on a daily basis, Strategy copycats rely on influencers in the crypto sector to promote their stocks. ProCap BTC is headed by Anthony Pompliano, Metaplanet’s voice is Simon Gerovich, XXI Capital hired a Strike CEO, Jack Mallers, while Nakamoto is helmed by Bitcoin Magazine CEO David Bailey, etc. All of these companies were founded or fully switched to a Bitcoin purchasing strategy in 2024 or 2025. Read more: Inspired by Saylor’s Strategy, TopWin shifts to digital assets by rebranding to ‘AsiaStrategy’ Interestingly enough, Bitcoin treasuries do not offer their clients any type of interaction with cryptocurrencies and do not hold crypto themselves. Instead, they outsource it to Coinbase and other centralized exchanges. What do ICOs and Bitcoin treasury companies have in common? While most crypto influencers are busy highlighting the growth of Bitcoin treasuries’ BTC holdings and presenting new purchases as “bullish,” many in the crypto community find the latest trend disturbing. They emphasize that these companies are rooted in TradFi and present regular public and private companies, except that they don’t produce anything and just buy Bitcoin using borrowed assets. “Bitcoin Treasury Company” Translation: We don’t build anything…we just bought Bitcoin and want your money too. This smells like 2017 ICO season in a new outfit. Spoiler: it won’t end well. pic.twitter.com/8gV19pPo9g — GG (@YourBTCStory) July 5, 2025 More than that, critics are concerned about possible risks as all these companies are centralized. As many of them are seemingly driven by FOMO and don’t have elaborate risk management strategies, they may end up not as sustainable as Strategy who managed to survive the 2022 crypto winter. Experts warn that newer companies may have to sell their bitcoins when the bear market starts. If it happens, it may trigger the ripple effect that would impact giants, including Strategy. Some compare Bitcoin treasury companies’ hype with the ICO era hype and remind everyone that it ended in a disaster. In 2018, the crypto market lost 85% of its value. This crash was harder than the market crash associated with the dot-com bubble burst that triggered a 78% drop. By December 2017, less than a third of companies that ran ICOs reached the goals of their campaigns. Proponents of Bitcoin treasuries notice that comparing ICOs and treasuries is not correct. The line between the two is that Bitcoin treasuries are legitimate public and private companies that allow their clients to benefit from Bitcoin price movements through a standard method, such as shares. At the same time, ICOs were dubious firms that just promised to create something valuable–”were selling vaporware,” as Joe Consorti, working for Theya and Horizon, put it in his tweet. Bitcoin Treasury Companies are not ""a new ICO bubble."" One uses strategic leverage funded in capital markets to acquire bitcoin for their shareholders. The other used false pretenses to sell vaporware to unassuming retail investors. Two different worlds. — Joe Consorti ⚡️ (@JoeConsorti) July 6, 2025 However, many in the crypto community outline various similarities between ICOs and treasuries. First off, unlike the trustless Bitcoin network, ICOs and treasuries involve trust. The companies in the ICO era managed to raise capital because they were able to convince many retail investors that they would release a strong product and their tokens would skyrocket. The treasury companies’ investors trust that these companies are not going to sell their bitcoins (Saylor and Gerovich both state they are never going to sell bitcoins ) or dilute their assets further. Lack of transparency on Bitcoin holdings of these companies increases the role of trust for their investors. Companies that held ICO campaigns and modern-day treasuries are accused of insider trading, lack of vesting period, lack of competence (in certain instances), the rug-pull potential, etc. For Bitcoin purists, the need to “trust” someone is an inherent flaw of any new trendy novelty on the market. I honestly haven't been toxic enough this cycle. No bitcoiner should trade away their self-sovereignty for your Faketoshi Nakamoto Corp’s issued trustmebro garbage Bitcoin is sound money. Just because a stock owns bitcoin, it doesn't mean that stock is now ultrasound money. https://t.co/Fr1oAaCXGQ — Pledditor (@Pledditor) June 16, 2025 A founder of the company Stack Wisely who uses the moniker Stack Hodler, explained why he gets the ICO vibes from the Bitcoin treasury companies’ hype, calling these companies “this cycle’s shitcoins.” According to Stack Hodler, “These companies are creating shares out of thin air to sell to people hoping to outperform Bitcoin.” As a healthy alternative to treasuries, Stack Hodler sees “businesses that create economic value via products and services, and then store their profits in Bitcoin,” adding that it “will bring lasting value to the Bitcoin network.” Bitcoin treasury companies are this cycle's shitcoins. Think about it: These companies are creating shares out of thin air to sell to people hoping to outperform Bitcoin. That's their product. It's just TradFi shitcoinery. And many will get rekt. The good news for now is that… pic.twitter.com/3HaRJESQXH — Stack Hodler (@stackhodler) May 13, 2025 Finally, David Bailey of a Bitcoin treasury company called Nakamoto found no better comparison of how he feels about making treasury business than saying, “it’s kind of like the early day ICOs.” Probably, he wasn’t thinking about how this era ended when he remarked. Here’s what he said: “It’s kind of like early days ICOs, where you have a posse of people you bring into that token. We have a posse of people that we are bringing into the treasury companies. We have the best practices nailed down on how to do it.” The anatomy of how a conman orchestrates pump and dump scams. This video will be used as evidence in a future court of law. pic.twitter.com/AkIAfGM9T7 — Justin Bechler (@1914ad) June 29, 2025 While some critics see Strategy as an outstanding treasury that deserves trust, others dismiss all the treasury companies altogether. Usually, critics don’t pay attention to the fact that some institutions cannot hold bitcoins directly; however, many of their arguments hit the mark. Another frequent comparison is SPACs, blank companies selling shares and promises. The discussion continues. However, the Bitcoin maxis’ voices have been on the rise as of late. Here’s what Scott Melker, known as the host of the Wolf of All Streets podcast, wrote in his newsletter after suggesting that many crypto treasury companies are scams: “I’m not here to tell any of you to stop trading or speculating if you know what you’re doing. Find your edge. Use it. But if you’re not truly confident, here’s the simple play: buy the assets these companies are speculating on – primarily Bitcoin. Forget the 20x, the 50x, the 100x dreams. Buy Bitcoin. It’s still going to $1 million even if the entire treasury narrative blows up in our faces.” You might also like: Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley explains why Bitcoin is going to reach $1,000,000",crypto_news,https://crypto.news/are-bitcoin-treasury-companies-a-new-bubble-akin-to-the-ico-boom-critics-and-industry-leaders-see-similarities/,"BTC|REGULATION|TOKEN SALE|BUSINESS|ZRX","Feature|ICO|michael saylor|stocks|Wall Street",cryptocompare

What Do The US Federal Agencies Think About Crypto in 2025? SEC: The SEC, under new leadership, is moving away from aggressive enforcement and toward developing clear regulatory lines, realistic registration paths, and sensible disclosure guidelines for crypto assets. CFTC: The CFTC is collaborating with the SEC and Congress to clarify jurisdiction, especially over digital commodities and derivatives.

FDIC/OCC: The FDIC has eased restrictions on banks’ crypto activities, while the OCC supports banks’ ability to custody digital assets US Crypto Tax 2025 Cryptocurrency in the US is taxed based on how long you hold the asset and your total taxable income. Short-term gains (assets held for one year or less) are taxed at ordinary income rates, while long-term gains (assets held for more than a year) are taxed at lower capital gains rates. Additionally, income from mining, staking, or receiving crypto as payment is taxed as ordinary income. Short-Term Crypto Tax Rates (Held ≤ 1 Year) Tax Rate Single Married Filing Jointly Married Filing Separately Head of Household 10% $0–$11,600 $0–$23,200 $0–$11,600 $0–$16,550 12% $11,601–$47,150 $23,201–$94,300 $11,601–$47,150 $16,551–$63,100 22% $47,151–$100,525 $94,301–$201,050 $47,151–$100,525 $63,101–$100,500 24% $100,526–$191,950 $201,051–$383,900 $100,526–$191,950 $100,501–$191,950 32% $191,951–$243,725 $383,901–$487,450 $191,951–$243,725 $191,951–$243,700 37% Over $609,351 Over $731,201 Over $365,601 Over $609,351 Long-Term Crypto Tax Rates (Held > 1 Year) Tax Rate Single Married Filing Jointly Married Filing Separately Head of Household 0% Up to $47,025 Up to $94,050 Up to $47,025 Up to $63,000 15% $47,026–$518,900 $94,051–$583,750 $47,026–$291,850 $63,001–$551,350 20% Over $518,900 Over $583,750 Over $291,850 Over $551,350 Additional Crypto Tax Rules Income from mining, staking, or payment: Taxed as ordinary income at the above rates. NFTs: Some may be taxed at a higher collectibles rate (up to 28%). Non-taxable events: Transfers between your own wallets and certain gifts are not taxable. Crypto companies: Subject to standard corporate income tax and must comply with reporting and AML/CFT rules. Example If you are single, earn $50,000 in total taxable income, and realize $5,000 short-term crypto gains and $10,000 long-term crypto gains: Short-term gains taxed at 22%: $1,100 Long-term gains taxed at 15%: $1,500 Total crypto tax owed: $2,600 These rates and rules ensure all crypto investors and companies are taxed in line with other property and investment assets in the US Crypto Adoption Rate In America In 2025, about 28% of American adults—around 65 million people—own cryptocurrency. Crypto ownership in the US has nearly doubled since 2021, rising from 15% to 28%. 14% of non-owners plan to buy crypto in 2025, and 67% of current owners plan to buy more this year. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin are the top three cryptocurrencies Americans plan to purchase in 2025. Crypto mining in the USA In 2025, the US leads the world in Bitcoin mining , accounting for over one-third of global mining power. On March 20, 2025, the SEC clarified that proof-of-work crypto mining is not subject to federal securities laws, removing registration requirements for miners. There is no federal ban on crypto mining; regulation is handled at the state level, with some states offering incentives and others imposing environmental restrictions. The Trump administration’s deregulatory approach in 2025 has encouraged domestic mining growth, but all miners must still comply with federal AML and CFT rules. Environmental concerns and energy usage debates continue, especially in states considering stricter oversight or moratoriums on mining operations. US Government’s Crypto Holdings As of April 2025, the US government holds approximately 198,012 Bitcoins, valued at about $18.3 billion. The US is the world’s largest state holder of Bitcoin, with these assets primarily acquired through law enforcement seizures and forfeitures. In March 2025, President Trump established the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a broader Digital Asset Stockpile, consolidating all federally held Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies (including Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and XRP) as permanent reserve assets. Conclusion US crypto regulation in 2025 marks a major turning point. The old approach of punishing innovation is being replaced with clear rules, legal support, and a national strategy for digital assets. While financial crimes are still a concern, the overall direction is bold, business-friendly, and built for long-term crypto adoption. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

According to a notice published on July 9, the country’s Ministry of Small-Medium Enterprises and Startups proposed to amend the “Special Act on Promoting Venture Businesses.” The amendment would have digital asset firms and other crypto-affiliated business operators no longer be restricted from registering as a venture companies. Entities registered as venture businesses in South Korea are typically small and medium-sized enterprises or startups . These companies receive official certification from the government and are eligible for government subsidies such as tax cuts and financial support depending on factors like investment or technological advancement. “[The amendment] will lead to the activation and expansion of the venture ecosystem and promote the fostering of the virtual asset industry,” wrote the ministry in its notice. Before the amendment, crypto firms were banned from registering under the venture companies category. They were placed in the list of banned businesses that include gambling facilities, which are still deterred from registering for certification.

Therefore, it had to forfeit the government subsidies it enjoyed. The company filed a lawsuit to contest the tax but was unsuccessful. South Korea’s new pro-crypto stance This policy amendment is in line with several pro-crypto initiatives launched by the government under South Korea’s new president, Lee Jae-myung . Since being sworn into office last month, Lee has pledged to support cryptocurrency assets backed by the South Korean Won and allow the nation’s pension fund to invest up to $884 billion in cryptocurrency. In addition, Lee is working towards lifting the ban on crypto-backed exchange-traded funds. His administration hopes to allow trading for spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETFs by the second half of this year. At the moment South Korea’s Democratic Party, the party that elected Lee as president, is currently pushing regulators to pass a working draft for the country’s first stablecoin bill dubbed “Basic Act on Digital Assets.” You might also like: Meet the new South Korea president Lee Jae-myung, what is his stance on crypto?",crypto_news,https://crypto.news/south-korea-to-reclassify-crypto-firms-as-startups-eligible-for-tax-cuts-and-other-benefits/,"REGULATION|ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE","News|Crypto assets|Law|South Korea|Startup",cryptocompare

With this, the top 10 tokens like Ethereum, XRP, Solana, Tron, Dogecoin and Cardano, hold above their respective support. Meanwhile, Cronos price spiked heavily due to the external factors, while the other tokens attracted notable gains. Therefore, the current crypto markets appear to be largely stable, with the market capitalisation and volume remaining within a range. Although the BTC price is an inch close to its ATH, the market sentiments continue to remain neutral, while the star token continues to hold a huge dominance. Besides, Cronos (CRO) and Raydium (RAY) attract double-digit gains, followed by popular memecoins. Meanwhile, the other tokens attract decent gains, hinting towards the markets experiencing a stabilized state. Cronos Settles After A Massive Breakout The CRO price experienced a pullback of nearly 5% after rising by more than 22% following the inclusion in the Truth Social Blue-Chip ETF filing . The token not only broke above the multi-month consolidated zone but also attracted volume that surged from levels around $10 million to as high as $230 million within a few hours. The long-term price action appears bearish as the sellers have booked the profit, but the short-term price action hints towards a drop in their actions as well. The CRO price is trying hard to hold the local support at $0.0897, which may offer a strong bullish rebound. The StochRSI has reached the oversold range, while the hourly MACD displays a rise in the selling pressure. However, the chart pattern suggests the support could be held firmly, which may further reinstitute a strong upswing back to the local highs and eventually achieve $0.1. Raydium Preparing for a Parabolic Recovery Raydium is climbing steadily with a significant rise in the buying pressure and is currently trading at $2.42 with a huge rise of over 13% in the past 24 hours. The token broke the $2.3 level with a strong bounce after bouncing from the $2.01 lows. This breakout is backed by a massive rise in the volume and a clean trend. RAY price appears to be undergoing a parabolic recovery that initiated before the start of the month. The latest rise pushed the price above the 50-day MA, which is now serving as a temporary support. A daily close above the levels could validate the rise, but until then, the fear of the pullback may haunt the rally. On the other hand, the RSI is incremental, which hints towards the rising strength of the rally. Therefore, the next levels to look out for are $2.42, followed by $2.56 and $2.7.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/crypto-market-today-top-tokens-stabilise-while-cronos-explodes-with-over-2000-rise-in-volume-followed-by-raydium/,"TRADING|CRO|RAY|MARKET|BTC","Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

A late-night post from technocrat Elon Musk slamming U.S. authorities for euthanizing the viral squirrel while failing to charge anyone from Jeffrey Epstein’s alleged client list preceded a volume and price spike, data shows, showing speculative fervor is alive and well in the market. (The ""Epstein list"" refers to high-profile individuals allegedly connected to Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking network. No official, verified public list exists.) “Government is deeply broken,” Musk wrote. “They arrested (and killed) Peanut, but have not even tried to file charges against anyone on the Epstein client list.” Within minutes, Solana-based meme token PNUT spiked over 10% as traders piled in on the name-drop. PNUT, which has no affiliation with the actual squirrel or Musk, saw trading volumes surge over 120% from $65 million to $214 million in a 24-hour period, according to CoinGecko. The token’s price briefly touched 23 cents before cooling. With no protocol, no utility, and no roadmap, PNUT trades purely on cultural resonance and reflexive speculation. That makes it a favorite for momentum hunters, and a token to watch for when controversial topics do the rounds — at least on Musk’s X.

2025-07-09T06:06:34,"We Asked 4 AIs If XRP Will Hit $10 Before ETH Taps $10K: You Won’t Believe the Split","TL;DR Four of the most utilized AI chatbots speculate on which one of the two largest altcoins will be the first to reach a significant round-numbered target of $10 for XRP and $10,000 for ETH. Although they acknowledged that it was a challenging prediction to make given their speculative nature, all four backed the same horse. Who’s First? Leaving aside the communities behind both cryptocurrencies and their respective ecosystems, this article will focus on what ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and Grok answered when asked the same question: Will XRP hit $10 first, or will ETH reach $10,000 first? Historically, Ether had come closer to its rather tall goal as it surged to almost $5,000 back in 2021. In contrast, XRP’s all-time high was at $3.4 in January 2018, and the asset only managed to match it in 2025. Although ETH is slightly closer to its target now, the difference is negligible as both require rather similar price increases (of around 300%) to reach their respective goals. While this sounds significant, especially for the two largest altcoins, let’s not forget that XRP experienced an even more remarkable price surge in late 2024 and early 2025. All AI solutions admitted that ETH appears as the more likely horse to win this race. They laid out its path toward the $10,000 target, claiming that ecosystem growth, network upgrades, RWA tokenization, and institutional adoption will push it higher. ChatGPT was particularly interested in the institutional adoption segment, indicating that ETH has an advantage not just because of the ETF demand it sees, but also due to the growing number of companies that have recently started storing ether as a reserve asset. Some even dumped BTC to buy more ETH. “Ethereum hitting $10,000 first seems more probable in the medium term. Its established ecosystem, ongoing technological advancements (especially the impact of spot ETFs), and its central role in the broader crypto space (DeFi, NFTs, RWA tokenization) provide a more diverse and robust set of drivers. The percentage increase required for Ethereum is also slightly lower than for XRP to reach $10.” – concluded Gemini but the sentiment was echoed by all other AIs. XRP’s Case Although the AI chatbots seemed conclusive in picking ETH as the potential winner, they also outlined the less probable scenario in which XRP goes into double-digit price territory first. Gemini said that its path is “contingent on regulatory clarity and widespread institutional adoption for cross-border payments.” Grok noted that Ripple’s token can reach $10 if the company behind it continues with its massive partnerships and acquisitions, which could increase the overall trust in the project. Recall that the company spent over $1.2 billion earlier this year to acquire the prime brokerage giant Hidden Road, a move described by the community as a “game-changer” for XRP . Additionally, all four AIs highlighted the potential approval of spot XRP ETF in the States, the odds of which are over 90% , according to experts and Polymarket. This would open the doors for institutions to invest in XRP through regulated financial vehicles, which should, in theory, act as a price booster.

2025-07-09T06:02:54,"Key Market Dynamic Keeps Bitcoin, XRP Anchored to $110K and $2.3 as Ether Looks Prone to Volatility","Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP (XRP) are trading sideways, which is likely being driven by a hidden force that's keeping both cryptocurrencies anchored to key price levels. However, the same ""price magnets"" might add to the ether (ETH) market volatility. We are talking about market makers – entities tasked with creating liquidity in an exchange's order book. These entities are always on the opposite side of traders/investors and make money from the bid-ask spread, while constantly striving to maintain a price-neutral exposure. Their hedging strategies in futures/spot markets often add to or curb volatility in the market. In BTC's case, options market makers are ""long gamma"" at strikes $108,000 and $110,000, according to Deribit-listed options activity tracked by Amberdata. The position indicates that market makers hold long options (calls and puts), which stand to benefit from potential volatility. As such, market makers are likely trading against market movements – selling high and buying low – to maintain the direction-neutral book, effectively keeping BTC pinned in the $108,000-$110,000 range. BTC's price has mostly traded the said range this month, according to CoinDesk data. A similar dynamic seems to be playing out in the XRP market, where a large positive market maker gamma build up is observed at the $2.30 strike price. That calls for maker makers to buy low and sell high around that level capping volatility. Ether prone to volatility Ethereum's native token ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, hit a high of $2,647 early today, the level last seen on June 16. The move has pushed ether into a ""negative market maker gamma"" zone of $2,650-$3,500. When dealers hold negative gamma, they tend to trade in the direction of the market, exacerbating bullish/bearish moves. In other words, their hedging activities could add to ether's bullish momentum, exacerbating volatility, assuming other things being equal.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/09/key-market-dynamic-keeps-bitcoin-xrp-anchored-to-usd110k-and-usd2-3-as-ether-looks-prone-to-volatility,"MARKET|BTC|XRP|TRADING|ETH","Markets|XRP|Bitcoin|Ether|Markets|Options|News",cryptocompare

According to Peterson, the period he calls the “Bitcoin Bastille Day Rally” will begin on July 14, which the analyst believes could herald a significant recovery phase for Bitcoin. Peterson, in his analysis based on historical data, noted that in years where Bitcoin underperforms, it typically experiences a strong rally starting around Bastille Day. He explained that this rally typically begins on July 14th and lasts until July 30th, noting that this two-week period is a critical time for Bitcoin to recoup its losses from the year. Related News: The Country Where Tether (USDT) Is Keeping Tons of Its Gold Has Been Revealed - Here Are the Details However, this rise also comes with a warning for investors: According to Peterson, the ten-week period following this two-week recovery period stands out as one of the weakest performing periods for Bitcoin historically. Peterson also noted that Bitcoin behaves like a “compressed spring,” arguing that historically, Bitcoin has seen an average rise of at least 16% in positive months. However, this year, this figure has only been 9% so far.

Price prediction for 2025 suggests a potential high of $32. Long-term forecasts indicate LINK could reach $195 by 2030. Chainlink has emerged as a game-changing decentralized oracle network, enabling smart contracts to connect seamlessly with real-world data, APIs, and traditional financial systems. As the crypto market evolves, Chainlink’s role continues to expand—especially with its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) gaining traction. Its native token, LINK, not only powers the ecosystem but has also caught the attention of investors and analysts. With LINK price showing signs of a potential breakout and strong on-chain fundamentals backing its rise, the big question remains: Can LINK coin price hit $50 in 2025? Let’s dive into this detailed Chainlink price prediction 2025–2030 to find out. Table of Contents Overview Chainlink Price Target July 2025 LINK Price Prediction 2025 Chainlink Price Targets 2026 – 2030 Market Analysis CoinPedia’s Chainlink Price Prediction FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency Chainlink Token LINK Price $ 14.07790680 5.55% Market Cap $ 9,546,228,185.9079 Trading Volume $ 363,373,234.3995 Circulating Supply 678,099,970.4528 All-time High $52.88 May 10, 2021 All-time Low $0.1263 Sep 23, 2017 Chainlink Price Target July 2025 In July 2025, Chainlink (LINK) is trying to reverse the decline from mid-May caused by a change in geopolitical factors. The end of June showed bullish reawakening in the short term as LINK price seeks a retest of the $18 neckline. This retest is essential for sustaining its upward momentum. The price is currently trying to stabilize around the $13 mark, and a successful break above the $18 level could signal a bullish trend. But if $13 breaks, then it might pull back to $10. LINK Price Prediction 2025 In 2025, Chainlink (LINK) started the year on a downward path, but by April, the tide began to turn. Early in the month, LINK began its recovery from a low of $10.067. By May, it had formed a bullish rounded bottom pattern, with a crucial neckline set at $18. However, since mid-May, LINK has faced challenges in maintaining its position near this neckline. By the third week of June, it pulled back toward the support level of the rounded bottom, which coincides with a multi-year support zone around $11. In the final week of June, LINK’s price began to rise again, but in past 15-days it is attempting to hold steady near the key $13 mark. If bullish momentum continues, LINK could aim to retest the neckline at $18 in July. For this price advance to sustain itself in the long term, LINK must break above and close daily above the $18 neckline. Such a move could signal a potential upward trend, increasing the chances of retesting the $24 resistance level in Q3 and Q4. This area is supported by a high-volume profile from earlier in the year. If LINK manages to surpass the $24 mark, projections for late 2025 suggest that the token could soar as high as $32.

In 2025, Ripple re-locked 700 million XRP each month, except June (670M), compared to 800M monthly from April to October 2024. This suggests Ripple is retaining an additional 100M XRP monthly. If the company continues using only 300M XRP monthly, the escrow could last 10 more years. But increasing usage to 400M XRP by 2026 would reduce that to 7.5 years. A steeper increase could shorten it to six. Analysts warn that if re-locking stops, the XRP supply could deplete even faster.

With the hearing titled “From Wall Street to Web3,” Garlinghouse urges Congress to act, stating, “Money should move like information and XRP is the key.” This marks a major turning point for Ripple, placing XRP at the center of crypto legislation debates. July 9, 2025 05:39:39 UTC XRP Price Could Soar if SEC Ends Ripple Case This Saturday Speculation is mounting that the SEC could announce the end of its case against Ripple this Saturday. If that happens, analysts believe it could signal a coordinated shift, including Fedwire adopting Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) alongside ISO20022 standards. Such a move would align the U.S. financial infrastructure with blockchain-based systems, potentially positioning XRP at the core. Market watchers say this could lead to a massive price breakout for XRP, driven by utility, clarity, and institutional confidence. If true, XRP may soon reach levels the market hasn’t yet imagined. July 9, 2025 05:39:39 UTC XRP ETF Backed by Trump Could Reshape Crypto Investing Trump’s Truth Social is reportedly applying to launch a “Crypto Blue Chip ETF,” featuring XRP, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. This marks a dramatic shift in U.S. political alignment with crypto, especially XRP, which has long faced regulatory pressure. The move could legitimize XRP on Wall Street, offering institutional access and reshaping its narrative. Combined with Ripple’s push for a national bank charter and growing real-world XRPL utility, the ETF may open the door to broader adoption. As power circles embrace XRP, analysts warn its price may not stay retail-level for long.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/ripple-xrp-news-today-xrp-price-prediction-xrp-etf-approval-news-ripple-vs-sec-and-more/,"XRP|TRADING|REGULATION|BTC|ETH|MARKET","News|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

2025-07-09T05:30:08,"2% Of All XRP Is In His Hands — But Who Is He?","A long‑time figure in the world of digital money and a noted XRP advocate stepped out of the shadows this week, sparking fresh chatter among investors and developers alike. Related Reading: XRP Could Hit $35 If It Captures A Quarter Of Remittance Market By 2029 Arthur Britto, who co‑founded Ripple Labs in 2012, broke a 14‑year silence with a single emoji on X. That tiny message carried big weight. His name rarely surfaces in headlines, but his work helped build XRP into one of the top assets by market value. Impact Of A Secretive Founder According to reports, Britto kept a low profile while helping craft the XRP Ledger’s code. He holds a 2% stake in XRP under a deal made when the company launched. That slice of holdings could be worth billions if the token’s price ever climbed high enough. Some in the market worry that if Britto ever sold even part of that stake, it might send prices tumbling. 🚨⚠️ HE CO-CREATED THE XRP LEDGER. HE HOLDS 2% OF ALL XRP. HE’S NEVER BEEN SEEN IN PUBLIC. Arthur Britto might be the most important figure in crypto you’ve never heard of. Let’s dive into the mystery.🧵👇 pic.twitter.com/xKyiYXIpGY — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) July 5, 2025 The Satoshi Connection Based on reports, comparisons to Bitcoin’s creator have swirled around Britto for years. Some fans point to the fact that Satoshi Nakamoto’s last known post came just as the XRP Ledger went live. That timing alone has led people to whisper that Britto could be Satoshi under a different name. No proof supports that idea. Experts say it’s more likely just a coincidence. Britto’s lone emoji on X was verified by Ripple CTO David Schwartz. That confirmation set off a wave of theories about what might come next. Some speculated a new protocol update. Others thought it hinted at a partnership or a fresh product launch. So far, nothing public has followed the post. Behind The Scenes At PolySign While he stayed away from interviews, Britto never stopped working. He co‑founded PolySign, a crypto custody firm that now operates under Ripple Custody. That arm provides secure storage for institutions holding digital coins. Based on filings, PolySign handled an estimated $1.5 billion in assets last year. Its integration into Ripple’s services shows Britto’s influence lives on, even if his name doesn’t show up on conference schedules. Related Reading: Ethereum Sees $6 Billion In Tokenized Funds As Big Players Jump In Future Moves And Market Watch With XRP trading near its recent range, some investors say they’re watching for any hint of action from Britto’s wallet. Price targets in the community sometimes stretch to $10,000 per XRP. Those figures come without verification, and many traders treat them as wishful thinking. Still, a lot can happen if even a fraction of Britto’s holdings moves.
