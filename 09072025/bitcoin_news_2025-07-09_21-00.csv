2025-07-09T18:43:46,"Bitcoin Price Rises Above $109K as Trump Calls for Biggest Interest Rate Cut in History","US President Donald Trump continues to state that the nation’s central bank keeps the interest rates too high and urged for another cut. Unlike the previous similar occasions, though, he was rather radical this time, claiming that the Federal Reserve needs to slash the rates by at least three points. First, President Trump mentions that higher rates are costing the US more money on interest expense. At a high level, this is true. Annual interest expense on US debt has reached $1.2 TRILLION over the last 12 months. The US is now paying $3.3 BILLION in interest per day. pic.twitter.com/22N9M2PdFX — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) July 9, 2025 According to the Kobeissi Letter, the US now pays well over $3 billion in interest alone per day. If Trump’s recommendation is followed by the Fed, then, he said, it would save $360 billion per year. However, the analysts at Kobeissi said the only debt that matters is the public one, which is at around $29 billion. Their analysis claims that if the rates on that entire amount are cut by 300 bps, the “US could save $290B x 3 = $870B/year.” “However, refinancing all of this debt immediately would be impossible. Realistically, 20% could be refinanced in year 1 to save ~$174B.” Although these numbers sound promising, there are certain drawbacks to such a potential rate cut, especially when it comes to inflation. It would be three times bigger than the current record seen in March 2020, when the Fed reduced the rates by 100bps. This would come with a US economy that is already growing at +3.8% YoY. As a result, we would expect to see a resurgence in CPI inflation, likely exceeding 5%. And, while it would initially send stocks higher as seen in March 2020, there’s no such thing as “free money.” pic.twitter.com/K5vRmp8Ay8 — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) July 9, 2025 The Kobeissi Letter further warned that mortgage rates would drop from 7% to 4% into a market that “has already seen prices rise +50% since 2020.” The analysts suggested that prices can surge by another 25%. Nevertheless, such a move should be highly beneficial for riskier assets like bitcoin. The cryptocurrency’s price is up by around 1% in the past day, and since Trump’s recommendation, it now stands close to $110,000. BTCUSD.

2025-07-09T18:43:08,"Why Are Bitcoin and Altcoins No Longer Responding to Donald Trump’s Tariff Threats? Here Are Expert Opinions","While Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP and Solana finished the day with slight increases today, the US's renegotiation with some of its foreign trade partners did not affect the crypto market much. However, according to analysts, despite these positive developments, cryptocurrencies are still stuck in a narrow price range. Bitcoin, for example, has traded largely between $107,000 and $110,000 in recent weeks. It’s up only 1.5% in the last 30 days, but it’s still close to its all-time high. Ethereum has been trading sideways at $2,500 for about a month, while Solana has also been stable around $150. The decline in cryptocurrencies following the “retaliatory tariffs” announced by US President Donald Trump in April contrasts with the recent stability. Some investors are struggling to understand why the market remains resilient despite Trump’s latest tariff threats. But analysts say this is not surprising. Experts say investors are less responsive to the US’s three-time postponement of negotiation deadlines and are more inclined to position themselves against macroeconomic uncertainty, allowing crypto assets to remain elevated despite the uncertainty. Related News: The Founder's Past Posts Have Surfaced in a Widely-Discussed Altcoin: Causing a Major Debate Trump sent official letters on Monday to 14 countries, including Japan, South Korea and Thailand, warning them that he would impose aggressive tariffs. The tariffs, ranging from 25% to 40%, are expected to go into effect on August 1. However, a possible delay is also on the agenda. Options analyst Bret Kenwell said investors believe Trump will delay the Aug. 1 tax cuts, which has even become the subject of a memecoin called “Trump Always Chickens Out.” “If there is confidence that negotiations will continue or the deadline will be extended, the market may continue to ignore such headlines,” Kenwell said. He also noted that any pullbacks would be viewed as buying opportunities for investors, which could pull prices back into the current range. Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, said investors have become accustomed to Trump’s volatile trade negotiations and are now more resilient to such macro developments. Magadini also noted that institutional investors have been hedging their exposure to BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) over the past seven months with options trading. Under this strategy, investors buy into the IBIT ETF, sell call options on it to generate income, and buy protective put options to reduce risk. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-09T18:10:34,"Bitcoin Whales Unleash Accumulation: A Critical Divide in Investor Confidence","Ever wondered what the true pulse of the Bitcoin market is? While headlines often focus on price fluctuations, the real story often unfolds behind the scenes, within the blockchain itself. Recent insights from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode reveal a fascinating and critical divergence in investor behavior: Bitcoin whales are quietly accumulating, while many smaller retail holders appear to be selling off their holdings. This stark contrast paints a vivid picture of current market sentiment and raises important questions about confidence levels across different investor tiers. Let’s dive deep into what this on-chain data signifies for the future of Bitcoin. Decoding the Behavior of Bitcoin Whales When we talk about Bitcoin whales , we’re referring to entities holding substantial amounts of BTC – typically 1,000 to 10,000 BTC, and sometimes even more. These are often institutional investors, high-net-worth individuals, or long-term holders with deep pockets and a long-term vision. According to Glassnode’s recent observations shared on X, these large players have been steadily increasing their Bitcoin stash. This isn’t just a random fluctuation; it’s a consistent pattern of accumulation, suggesting a strong conviction in Bitcoin’s future value, even amidst price volatility. What drives this behavior? Whales often have access to sophisticated market analysis, a higher risk tolerance, and the ability to ride out short-term downturns, viewing them as opportunities to buy at a discount. Their accumulation patterns are often seen as a bullish signal. If those with the most capital are buying, it implies they foresee significant upside potential. This isn’t to say their actions are infallible, but they certainly carry weight in the market narrative. It suggests a strategic play, possibly anticipating future demand, broader institutional adoption, or a long-term appreciation in Bitcoin’s value as a digital store of value. Why Are Retail Holders Selling Their Bitcoin? On the flip side, Glassnode’s data points to a different trend among smaller investors, specifically those holding between 1 and 10 BTC, often categorized as retail holders . These groups have shown a tendency to sell off their Bitcoin. This behavior could stem from several factors. For many retail investors, short-term price movements can trigger emotional responses. A dip in price might lead to panic selling, or perhaps they’re taking profits after a recent rally, aiming to de-risk or reallocate funds. Economic pressures, such as inflation or rising interest rates, might also compel some to liquidate assets to meet immediate financial needs. Another perspective is that some retail holders might be moving their assets off exchanges, or consolidating them into fewer wallets, which could appear as ‘selling’ from a specific wallet group’s perspective, though Glassnode’s methodology usually accounts for such movements. However, the prevailing interpretation points to a genuine reduction in holdings for this segment. This contrast in behavior highlights a clear divergence in confidence and strategy between the seasoned, deep-pocketed investors and the broader individual investor base. What Does This Market Sentiment Divide Imply? The stark difference in behavior between Bitcoin whales and retail holders provides crucial insights into current market sentiment . When whales accumulate, it often indicates a long-term bullish outlook. They are “buying the dip” or simply adding to their positions, confident that Bitcoin’s value will increase over time. Their actions can act as a stabilizing force, absorbing selling pressure from smaller investors. Conversely, the selling by retail holders can reflect a more cautious, fearful, or short-term opportunistic mindset. It might signal a lack of conviction, a need for liquidity, or simply a reaction to FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) in the market. This divide suggests that while the foundational belief in Bitcoin’s long-term potential remains strong among large entities, there’s a degree of uncertainty or short-term profit-taking occurring among smaller participants. Understanding this dynamic is key for anyone trying to gauge the underlying health and direction of the cryptocurrency market. Leveraging On-Chain Data for Informed Decisions This is where the power of on-chain data comes into play. Firms like Glassnode analyze publicly available information on the blockchain – every transaction, every wallet balance, every movement of coins. By aggregating and interpreting this data, they can identify patterns and trends that are invisible through traditional market analysis methods, which often focus solely on price and volume from exchanges. On-chain metrics provide a unique “x-ray vision” into the fundamental supply and demand dynamics of Bitcoin. They allow us to see not just what is being traded, but who is trading it, and in what quantities. For investors, this means gaining a deeper understanding of genuine accumulation or distribution phases. Instead of relying purely on news headlines or price charts, on-chain data offers a more robust, transparent, and often less emotional perspective on investor conviction. It helps distinguish between short-term noise and long-term structural shifts in market behavior. Identifying Accumulation Zones: On-chain data can help pinpoint periods where large entities are actively buying. Gauging Investor Confidence: By observing the net flow of coins into or out of different wallet sizes, one can infer the overall sentiment of various investor groups. Spotting Supply Shocks: Understanding how much Bitcoin is being held in long-term wallets versus short-term trading wallets can indicate potential supply shortages or gluts. Navigating the Challenges of On-Chain Analysis While incredibly powerful, interpreting on-chain data isn’t without its challenges. It requires a nuanced understanding of various metrics and their context. For instance, a single large transaction could represent an internal wallet transfer by an exchange, rather than a genuine sale or purchase by an investor. Analysts must employ sophisticated techniques to filter out such noise and accurately identify meaningful trends. Moreover, on-chain data provides insights into supply-side dynamics, but it doesn’t account for all market drivers. Macroeconomic factors, regulatory news, technological developments, and broader geopolitical events also play significant roles in shaping Bitcoin’s price. Therefore, on-chain analysis should be used as one powerful tool in a comprehensive analytical toolkit, rather than the sole determinant of investment decisions. Actionable Insights for Your Bitcoin Strategy So, what does this divergence mean for you, the individual investor? Firstly, it reinforces the idea that conviction is key. While retail investors might be swayed by short-term price movements, the steady accumulation by whales suggests a strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. This doesn’t mean you should blindly follow the whales, but it does provide a perspective that encourages a longer-term outlook rather than panic selling during dips. Secondly, it highlights the importance of doing your own research. While Glassnode’s data is invaluable, understanding your own financial goals and risk tolerance is paramount. Consider a dollar-cost averaging strategy to mitigate the impact of volatility, rather than trying to time the market perfectly. Finally, embrace the transparency of the blockchain. Tools and analyses derived from on-chain data can empower you to make more informed decisions, moving beyond speculative narratives to understand the underlying movements of Bitcoin’s supply and demand. By paying attention to these fundamental shifts, you can better position yourself in a volatile yet promising market. Conclusion: A Tale of Two Investor Worlds The latest revelations from Glassnode paint a compelling picture of the current Bitcoin landscape: a clear and critical divide between the confident accumulation of Bitcoin whales and the cautious selling by many retail holders . This divergence in market sentiment , uncovered through meticulous on-chain data analysis, underscores the varying perspectives and strategies at play. While small investors may be reacting to short-term pressures, the consistent buying by large entities signals a profound belief in Bitcoin’s enduring value proposition. This powerful insight serves as a reminder that understanding the fundamental movements of coins on the blockchain is essential for truly grasping the market’s pulse. As Bitcoin continues its journey, monitoring these on-chain dynamics will remain crucial for discerning its true trajectory.

2025-07-09T18:03:09,"Solana  ETFs See $78M Inflows as Interest in Altcoin Investment Products Grows","Three Solana-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) listed in the U.S. have quietly pulled in $78 million over the past month, reflecting rising interest in altcoin-backed investment products despite the outsized dominance of bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) in ETF markets. The Solana REX-Osprey SOL + Staking ETF (SSK), which launched July 2, has already attracted over $41 million in assets under management, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Meanwhile, Volatility Shares’ leveraged Solana ETF (SOLT) has accumulated $69 million year-to-date, and its regular Solana ETF (SOLZ) holds $23 million. “It’s all much smaller than btc or eth but lot of green numbers = good,” Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas wrote in a post on X. The inflows come as several asset managers prepare for what they hope will be the next major crypto ETF approval: a spot Solana fund that includes staking rewards. While the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has yet to approve such a product, industry analysts are increasingly optimistic. Earlier this week, CoinDesk reported that the SEC requested issuers re-file key documents by the end of July, signaling a potentially faster timeline than the October deadline originally anticipated. If so, solana (SOL) would join bitcoin and ether as one of the few cryptocurrencies available to U.S. investors through spot ETFs. The bitcoin ETFs, launched in January, have drawn nearly $50 billion in capital, transforming the market for digital assets and placing BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) among the top revenue-generating funds of any kind. IBIT alone now holds 700,000 BTC . Ethereum ETFs, which were approved more recently, have pulled in about $4.5 billion so far.

2025-07-09T17:41:42,"Best Crypto to Buy As Ethereum Accumulation Rises - Altcoin Season Next?","Ethereum has been unusually quiet, and that silence is starting to look deliberate. For several weeks now, ETH has hovered around the $2500 mark with little deviation, absorbing volatility while volumes steadily rise. That kind of stability, especially in a token known for wide swings, signals preparation rather than hesitation. Institutional activity has picked up considerably. Spot transactions are growing heavier, and on-chain metrics point to a steady surge in interest, not just from retail but from long-term allocators as well. The market seems to be watching ETH with a kind of controlled anticipation, and that attention has a direction. Ethereum’s Shift from Store to Engine and What That Means for the Rest of the Market In the last few weeks, two publicly listed companies have made massive moves into ETH. Bit Digital, a Nasdaq-traded firm, sold off its Bitcoin reserves and converted over $200 million into ETH, stating openly that Ethereum’s yield structure and long-term financial utility aligned better with its strategy. They swapped all of their BTC for ETH 😮This makes @BitDigital_BTBT the 3rd largest ETH holder as a publicly traded company ($250M+ worth). pic.twitter.com/fBmjqYS21u — FOMO HOUR (@fomohour) July 8, 2025 Around the same time, SharpLink Gaming added over 200,000 ETH to its treasury and staked the entire amount. Both firms raised additional capital from public markets specifically to increase their Ethereum holdings. These are not minor portfolio shifts. They reflect a structural bet on ETH as a productive, programmable asset rather than a speculative one. ⚡️BIG: SharpLink Gaming has purchased 7,689 $ETH worth $19.2 million, increasing its total Ethereum holdings to 205,634 $ETH . This makes @SharpLinkGaming (NASDAQ: $SBET ) the largest publicly traded $ETH holder and shows its aggressive buying strategy as institutional demand… pic.twitter.com/Wf794A2OSU — Crypto Coin Show (@CryptoCoinShow) July 9, 2025 What makes this more significant is the timing. Ethereum has remained steady around the $2500 level while trading volume continues to rise. Liquidity has also returned in the form of ERC-20 stablecoins, which just hit a record $121 billion in supply. These are conditions that typically set the floor for a wider altcoin breakout. Ethereum’s consolidation, coupled with rising participation and large-scale repositioning by major players, is laying the groundwork. And when ETH becomes the magnet, altcoins do not need to ask for attention, they just need to be close enough to catch the spillover. That season is not here yet, but the air has changed. The capital is waiting, and the rotation could begin the moment ETH makes its next real move. Best Crypto to Buy Now - Tokens That Could Pump As the Altcoin Season Approaches Snorter Snorter is built for how crypto is actually used, not how it is marketed. Its core utility lies in its deep integration with Telegram, which remains the most active layer of crypto communication today. Rather than forcing users to adopt a new interface or switch platforms, Snorter embeds an entire analytical and executional framework within a space traders and community members already trust. It handles everything from wallet scanning to sentiment tracking to trade execution, all through conversational prompts inside Telegram chats. This kind of embedded design does not just reduce friction. It changes the speed of action. Users no longer need to move between tools, copy-paste data, or rely on third-party dashboards. Everything flows in real time, inside the conversation. The bot is fast, adaptable, and transparent in its logic, which matters more as noise returns to the market. SNORT was also dubbed to be one of the highest potential presales to consider investing in by top creators and YouTubers like ClayBro and many others, further adding to its popularity. If Ethereum’s current steadiness does lead to a renewed rotation into altcoins, the attention will not be quiet. Snorter is made for that kind of environment. It does not rely on a token pump or abstract hype. Its appeal lies in clarity and control, which become more valuable when volatility returns. As users re-engage, they are likely to choose tools that keep them rooted in the places they already operate from. Snorter sits exactly in that pocket. Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper exists to serve a different demand; one grounded in Bitcoin’s base layer but unhindered by its limitations. Built as a Layer 2 network specifically for Bitcoin, Hyper enables smart contracts, low-fee transactions, and application-level programmability without moving away from Bitcoin’s core security and settlement structure. This makes it a functional extension rather than a departure. The logic behind it is straightforward. Bitcoin is often framed as digital gold, but gold cannot process a microtransaction, power a decentralized app, or offer smart execution conditions. Hyper introduces that missing logic while keeping BTC at the center. It is not trying to compete on ecosystem size. It is building a parallel utility set that speaks to Bitcoin’s own user base. The timing is relevant. As Ethereum continues to attract institutional holders and redefine itself as a foundational financial asset, capital is likely to look for complementary systems rather than pure alternatives. Bitcoin Hyper fits into that landscape precisely because it does not ask users to abandon BTC. It simply gives them a way to do more with it. If liquidity begins to flow more widely, protocols that offer this kind of practical expansion will likely stand out, not because they promise more, but because they unlock what was previously restricted. SUBBD SUBBD is structured around creators, not tokens. It does not depend on speculative traction or narrative cycles. Instead, it offers a model where content ownership, discovery, and monetization are built into the system itself. Unlike traditional platforms that control reach and revenue through opaque algorithms, SUBBD allows creators to embed access rules, membership layers, and monetization logic directly into their work using smart contracts. This approach turns each creator into their own ecosystem. Whether it is video, writing, audio, or niche community content, the rules are written by the creator and enforced by the platform’s underlying protocol. This creates consistency in experience and revenue without forcing users or creators into subscription silos or ad-based engagement loops. SUBBD is not trying to rebuild social media. It is building a content economy from the creator upward.

They provide application-level proof of what on-chain logic can do outside of finance. If an altcoin cycle begins to take shape, the market will likely reward projects that demonstrate actual embedded utility and content remains one of the most defensible and scalable categories for that kind of use. SUBBD operates there with precision. Best Wallet Best Wallet is not built for speculation. It is designed for everyday crypto use, and that distinction changes how it functions. At its core, it is a multi-chain Web3 wallet that handles asset storage, transaction execution, token discovery, and dApp access in one continuous interface. The layout is clean, but more importantly, the experience is intentional. Navigation feels immediate. Tasks that are typically segmented- like bridging assets, interacting with staking pools, or participating in presales are streamlined into processes that feel native. The strength of Best Wallet lies in its architecture. It does not treat networks like compartments. It allows users to move across Ethereum, Solana, and other major ecosystems without technical barriers. For those entering the market now, that kind of flexibility is essential. The focus has shifted from holding assets to interacting with them, and wallets need to reflect that shift. As Ethereum consolidates and altcoin attention begins to re-emerge, users will need tools that make participation seamless. That includes managing multiple assets, navigating early-stage launches, and verifying smart contract permissions without relying on clunky workarounds. Best Wallet meets that need with actual infrastructure, not marketing features. If a new cycle builds from the base Ethereum is laying down, the tools that manage and extend that access will play a central role. Best Wallet positions itself there; not as a gateway, but as a full system for interaction. That positioning may prove valuable as user activity returns. Conclusion As Ethereum continues to consolidate and institutional alignment grows stronger, the market is beginning to shift its posture. What was once a scattered field of speculation is becoming a more focused search for function. If this trend continues and an altcoin season does unfold, it will not reward noise; it will reward readiness. The assets discussed above each reflect a different layer of that logic. Some enhance user access, some extend existing networks, and others introduce entirely new models of interaction. What unites them is timing. They are not waiting for a trend. They are built for the conditions that may arrive once the next phase begins. That alone makes them worth watching now. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

2025-07-09T17:33:13,"BTCI: Squeezing ~30% Distribution Yield From Bitcoin","Summary BTCI offers high monthly 'income' by writing call options on Bitcoin futures but carries significant risk due to Bitcoin's volatility. The strong performance of Bitcoin and its high 30%+ distribution yield has attracted relatively strong investor interest, with AUM rising quickly. While BTCI has outperformed traditional assets by a wide margin, its options strategy can cap upside and lead to underperformance versus pure Bitcoin ETFs in strong rallies. BTCI is best suited for income-focused investors comfortable with volatility but is not appropriate for the risk-averse given the potential for rapid declines. Written by Nick Ackerman, co-produced by Stanford Chemist NEOS is an ETF sponsor that has been bringing some unique ETFs to the market. One of those is the NEOS Bitcoin High Income ETF ( BTCI ), launched toward the end of 2024. This is a relatively newer fund, but the idea is rather simple: the fund holds cash equivalents and Bitcoin USD ( BTC-USD ) exposure through an ETF and long call options while it also writes call options against Bitcoin futures. The fund is actively managed with a ""data-driven call option strategy."" By writing call options, this provides the fund with option premiums, which can be distributed to investors. I believe this fund is rather risky overall and definitely not for those risk-averse investors. However, someone who is interested in investing in Bitcoin and wants high distribution could find it an interesting idea. BTCI Basics Dividend Frequency: Monthly. Dividend Yield: 2.10% SEC yield, 30.25% Distribution Yield. Expense Ratio: 0.98%. Leverage: N/A. Managed Assets: $345.1 million. Structure: Active ETF. BTCI's investment objective is to ""generate high monthly income with the potential for appreciation based on exposure to exchange-traded products (""ETP"") that have direct exposure to Bitcoin. They continue with seeking ""to distribute monthly income generated from writing call options on Bitcoin Futures ETFs."" The fund is actively managed and ""seeks to offer upside potential via efficient exposure to Bitcoin ETPs."" Despite a relatively short history of coming to market only on October 17, 2024, the fund has garnered much interest, and AUM has risen rapidly. Generally, a high distribution rate can cause a lot of attention. The popularity of Bitcoin also appears to be growing, thanks to its very strong returns as well. Of course, we know that is history, and past performance is no guarantee of future results. So, make of that what you will. BTCI's Portfolio BTCI's portfolio is quite simple, as it tends to be for this single-asset ETF offering. They hold VanEck Bitcoin ETF ( HODL ) as their more straightforward exposure to Bitcoin; however, it can get a bit more complicated with the options positioning. This is because they go long and short Bitcoin call options as well as short puts. Overall, the fund holds the highest allocation to U.S. Treasury Bills.

Because the Fund’s exposure to the Bitcoin Futures ETF is obtained via options instead of owning the reference asset, the Fund’s exposure is considered to be “synthetic.” The synthetic exposure is created through the combination of purchasing call options and selling put options generally at the same strike price with the same expiration. This combination synthetically creates the upside and downside participation in the price returns of the Bitcoin Futures ETF. The Fund will primarily gain exposure to increases in value experienced by the Bitcoin Futures ETF through the purchase of call options. As a buyer of these options, the Fund pays a premium to the seller of the options. The Fund will primarily gain exposure to decreases in value experienced by the Bitcoin Futures ETF through the sale of put options. As the seller of these options, the Fund receives a premium from the buyer of the options. In combination, the purchased call and sold put options generally provide exposure to price returns of the Bitcoin Futures ETF both on the upside and downside. Performance And Distribution The fund offers an extremely high distribution rate of ~30% so far. As long as Bitcoin can continue to have a strong run, this fund could actually achieve that type of return. As we can see, the fund has delivered market-beating returns against both equities and fixed income—this is by a huge margin too. The market price was $50 at launch and is now closer to $60, indicating that there has been some appreciation on top of the high distribution rate. YCharts However, I believe there is considerable risk in investing in Bitcoin as it can be quite a volatile asset. In fact, that's generally why the distribution rate can be so high, as the volatility increases, the option premiums are brought in. For example, the fund utilizes writing options (and goes long) with the CBOE Mini Bitcoin U.S. ETF Index, which has an implied volatility of around 35% on the $250 call. CBOE Mini Bitcoin U.S. ETF Index (Fidelity) For some context, the implied volatility for the SPDR® S&P 500® ETF ( SPY ) for the first call strike below the current trading price is at ~17%. By writing those calls, the fund generates the cash flow provided by collecting the premiums and distributing them through a monthly distribution. Given the high allocation to U.S. Treasury Bills, that's also generating some interest payments within the fund. BTCI Distribution History (Seeking Alpha) Basically, that is where the 30-day SEC Yield of 2.10% is coming in while the fund's distribution rate is listed at 30.25% currently on the fund's website. BTCI Distribution and Expenses (NEOS) However, there is some downside to the fund utilizing options writing to generate the cash for the distribution. It comes with the risk that all call writing funds have to contend with, and that is the upside cap when an underlying investment is running sharply higher. This cap can get hit, and it can mean that the fund can limit its upside. In fact, the fund's latest semi-annual report for an abbreviated period showed that the fund saw realized losses from the written option contracts. BTCI Semi-Annual Report (NEOS) That's where you can see that BTCI has actually underperformed its ETF holding, HODL, by quite a meaningful margin. YCharts However, there can be some potential downside protection with a call writing strategy. It isn't much, but the premiums received offset declines in the underlying instruments that BTCI is long as well. In a flat market, BTCI would also be considered outperforming, as even if the underlying is moving sideways, those premiums can still be collected for some gains. One fund I hold that is in the Bitcoin space, while also paying a monthly distribution, is ProShares Bitcoin ETF ( BITO ). The fund has outperformed BTCI during this period since the ETF's inception. YCharts However, the fund invests in futures and swaps for its Bitcoin exposure. It also doesn't utilize an options writing strategy, but the distributions come from the gains (and interest payments from the underlying Treasury holdings) produced on those derivatives. If those gains stopped, the distribution would fall dramatically—closer to the yield on Treasury Bills minus the 0.95% expense ratio. That's why you'll see the distribution history looks like this: BITO Distribution History (Seeking Alpha) As a more income-focused investor, I definitely prefer BITO and BTCI compared to holding a Bitcoin ETF or holding Bitcoin itself. I'm aware of not participating as much in the overall total returns. However, I find peace of mind, and that it is beneficial to have these gains/income distributed out monthly. If there is a collapse in Bitcoin, then I know some gains will be locked in or losses limited. Conclusion BTCI is a risky strategy as Bitcoin is considered quite volatile. At the same time, it has performed extremely well, and that has meant a lot of investor interest is being driven in that direction. BTCI provides exposure to Bitcoin either through ETFs or synthetically with options; it then applies an options writing strategy over the portfolio, which provides a significant monthly distribution to investors. High distributions tend to gain a lot of investor interest, so it might not be too surprising to see how fast this ETF is seeing inflows. However, I would reiterate that it does not appear to be appropriate for more risk-averse investors. The fund has experienced significant appreciation thanks to strong gains from Bitcoin, but such strong gains will not be guaranteed going forward. April of this year provided a good example of how far Bitcoin and this ETF can fall quite rapidly.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4800204-btci-squeezing-30-percent-distribution-yield-from-bitcoin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|REGULATION|MARKET","BTC-USD|HODL|SPY|BITO|BTCI",cryptocompare

While the broader market coughed up a 2.7% loss in the last 24 hours, the frog went ballistic again – pumping 10.1% and extending a win streak that’s starting to feel like muscle memory. In the past week alone, WEPE has pushed over $2.4 million in DEX volume – wild numbers for a sub-$10 million market cap coin that launched without a VC sugar daddy or influencer handouts. To put it in degenerate context, that’s nearly six times Jordan Belfort’s infamous $420,000 ‘business expense’ in a single month – and WEPE didn’t need expensive champagne or sides to pull it off. Just a clean chart, community conviction, and the kind of liquidity whales pretend not to notice until it’s already 5x. But what’s been fueling even more attention lately is the NFT collection the team’s been teasing across socials, plus the ongoing success of its private trading group, Alpha Chat. It all shows one thing: the spirit behind this project isn’t fading – it’s gaining fire. And the fight against the whales? It’s only getting louder. https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/wall-street-pepe The Market Wobbled, but WEPE’s NFT Army Tightened Its Tie and Hit Mint Mode Before market uncertainty crept in – thanks to tariff man POTUS Donald Trump jumping back into the headlines – WEPE had already stacked a 370% gain in just one month. Even with the slight pullback that followed, the token is still up over 102% in the past two weeks, holding firm while most of the market trips over itself. A big part of that? The 5,000-piece NFT collection the team’s been teasing, with 1,000 free mints reserved for holders that it announced on Sunday. NFT drop for the fam. pic.twitter.com/eMtq8A3aLO — Wall Street Pepe (@WEPEToken) July 6, 2025 The drop’s already heating up through the QuestN campaign, where users grind out tasks to lock in their spot. https://app.questn.com/Wepe In short, Wall Street Pepe is bringing NFTs back in style – and the suited frog is pitching them smoother than Aerotyne International ever sounded. But this time, it’s not some boiler room scam. The collection is for the community, and it’s set to strengthen the army behind one of the grittiest meme coins in the game – one chest-thumping NFT at a time. And that army is not just watching from the sidelines. Inside WEPE’s Alpha Chat, members have landed gains between 500% to 1,000% – turning signals into action and fueling the kind of belief that keeps charts moving and buyers coming back. Something Bigger May Be Brewing But here’s another signal for the community: those watching closely have picked up on what might be next. A brand-new website is now in the works – likely a move to match the energy and growth the project’s been seeing. A sharper front-end signals a sharper phase, and WEPE’s not in the habit of doing things halfway. New site loading. New era brewing. You asked for big, Wepe team are about to drop massive. pic.twitter.com/bS6UzsgC0T — Wall Street Pepe (@WEPEToken) July 9, 2025 There’s also talk of a renewed roadmap. Nothing official yet, but anyone who’s been following this frog knows it doesn’t dream small. With a track record of shipping, rallying, and keeping retail in profit, the idea of new goals on the horizon is already stirring speculation. And if those updates hit like the last ones? This won’t just be another leg up – it could be the kind of shift that sends a meme coin from cult classic to serious contender – so watch out DOGE!

2025-07-09T17:20:28,"Bitcoin Starts Surging Toward $110K After Trump Says 'Fed Rate' Is 300 Basis Points Too High","Bitcoin surged to $109,343 on July 9, up 0.8% over the prior 24 hours, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. In a Truth Social post at 10:00 a.m. ET, Trump declared that the U.S. federal funds rate is “at least 3 points too high,” referring to a 300 basis point (3%) cut. He argued that delaying such a move imposes an annual burden of $360 billion on refinancing costs. Within 30 minutes, BTC began rising steadily as traders appeared to price in the short-term implications of such a dramatic policy shift, including the potential for renewed liquidity and risk-on sentiment. In a comprehensive thread on X , macro analysts at The Kobeissi Letter provided a detailed breakdown of Trump’s claim. According to their analysis, total U.S. interest payments have already reached $1.2 trillion over the past 12 months—equivalent to $3.3 billion per day. They noted that while Trump’s math assumes $360 billion in savings per percentage point across $36 trillion in national debt, only about $29 trillion is held publicly and would be affected by rate changes. Under more realistic assumptions, they estimate that a full 300 bps cut applied gradually could reduce interest expense by roughly $174 billion in the first year, potentially totaling $2.5 trillion over five years if 20% of the debt is refinanced annually. Despite these potential savings, the report warned that the broader economic consequences of a 3% cut would be historic. No single Fed rate cut in modern history has exceeded 100 basis points — even during the 2008 crisis or the March 2020 emergency move. Implementing a 300 bps reduction outside of a recession, in an economy growing at 3.8% annually, would be unprecedented. The Kobeissi Letter cautioned that such a move would likely reignite inflation above 5%, trigger a steep drop in the U.S. dollar — potentially exceeding 10% — and cause housing prices to surge due to a sharp decline in mortgage rates. Asset markets would likely rally in the short term, with gold forecasted to hit $5,000, oil above $80 per barrel, and the S&P 500 breaching 7,000. However, they emphasized that the long-term consequences would be destabilizing without major reductions in U.S. government spending. For Bitcoin, the implications are clear: a sudden drop in interest rates would be viewed as monetary stimulus, likely accelerating capital inflows into hard assets and alternative stores of value like BTC. While analysts continue to debate the likelihood of such cuts, the market's immediate reaction suggests investors are positioning for upside risk. Technical Analysis Highlights The BTC price moved sharply within 30 minutes of Trump’s Truth Social post at 10:00 a.m. ET. Consolidation persisted earlier in the day, but buying volume increased significantly after Trump’s rate comments. Price tested resistance near $109,761, with higher lows forming above $108,500, indicating bullish structure. Bollinger Bands compressed to their tightest levels in this cycle, historically a signal of pending breakout. Institutional accumulation remains visible via volume clusters near support zones around $108,500–$108,600.

Hackers are abusing the op_return function to embed messages in transactions, creating a new form of phishing. As BTC trades near record levels, old wallets are looking ever more attractive. Attackers are attempting a new type of phishing by abusing the op_return function on Bitcoin. Using op_return allows the embedding of information in each BTC transaction. This function was also used to create Bitcoin-based NFTs. Scammers are generating messages that spoof official-looking sites, claiming ownership of the wallet. The message can do nothing to move the coins, but it can urge some users to take action. Some messages embedded in transactions point to sites or forms. Others attempt to claim ownership of the wallet, as in previous cases that tried to exploit older whales. The attempts at scamming owners mostly targeted whale wallets from the 2011 era. Mt. Gox hacker wallet receives spoof transactions One of the most targeted wallets belongs to the Mt. Gox Hacker, containing 79.95K BTC valued at over $8B. The wallet was last dusted on July 5, 2025, though it received additional tracing transactions or messages in the past. None of the coins in the wallet has been moved. One of the transactions from July 3, 2025, contained an op_return message pointing to an ‘owner notice’. The notice, when decoded, called the wallet holder to visit a site claiming to be linked to Salomon Brothers, a known Wall Street firm that was acquired by Citigroup in 2003 and no longer exists as a legal entity. Since July 3, the spoof site has been taken down. But before that, the message suggested that a third party attempted to claim possession of the wallet in legal terms. The claim via op_return, sent to the wallet, resembled the attempts of Calvin Ayre to prove ownership of old wallets. Scammers gather data or attempt pseudo-legal claims Some of the links sent in the op_return message attempt to gather personal data or connect a wallet to a real identity. So far, legal claims against inactive wallets have been unsuccessful, as BTC ownership hinges on holding private keys. Neither miners nor developers can claw back the BTC from idle wallets, despite claims of ownership. However, knowing the identity of old whales, if extracted through phishing, could lead to other types of attacks, such as kidnapping or attempting to steal private keys. Interest in old wallets increased after a whale with coins from 2011 moved 80,000 BTC to new addresses in a single day. Some of the initial whale wallets immediately received dust transactions containing spoofed op_return messages with pseudo-legal language. A recently emptied whale wallet received an op_return message claiming ownership over the wallet, embedded in a dust transaction. | Source: Blockchain.com One of the messages read ‘ LEGAL NOTICE: We have taken possession of this wallet and its contents ’. However, the actual wallet was emptied, and the coins were controlled by a new owner, with no further need for a legal claim. The cluster of dormant whale wallets also revealed that op_return attacks came in coordinated waves, potentially linked to a handful of bad actors making attempts to gather data or deploy other phishing tools. Attacks via op_return messages may stop after a Bitcoin upgrade, as there are proposals to limit the data threshold to just 80 bytes, not allowing even short messages.

2025-07-09T17:14:10,"Bitcoin hovers near key breakout zone as XLM, RAY rally double digits","Bitcoin remained rangebound as bulls sought to hold the flagship cryptocurrency above the $109,000 mark. The broader digital asset market advanced in tandem, with total crypto market capitalisation up approximately 1.5% to $3.46 trillion by late Asian trading hours on Wednesday. Despite Bitcoin trading less than 3% below its all-time high, repeated failures to breach $110,000 have tempered short-term optimism. Still, sentiment remains firmly in the greed zone, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index holding at 66, a sign that investors are continuing to position for a potential breakout into price discovery. While not yet in a full-fledged alt season, altcoins had started showing signs of momentum, with most major tokens trading in the green at the time of writing. Why is Bitcoin price stuck? Bitcoin has been trading between a tight range of $107,475 and $110,307 over the past week, with a number of market forces currently dictating price action. On the upside, anticipation of rate cuts and broader trade deals has underpinned bullish expectations. Analysts say traders are watching macro developments closely, particularly as the US moves toward finalising trade agreements with several major economies. Letters sent by former President Trump to various negotiating parties, reaffirming the August 1 deadline, have also been viewed as strategic pressure to speed up deals. A broader agreement is seen as risk-positive and could trigger inflows into both equities and crypto. Meanwhile, expectations of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve as early as September have further supported long positioning. Polymarket odds currently price a 50% chance of a September cut, with rising probabilities for multiple rate reductions this year. Such easing could reduce the attractiveness of bonds and drive capital into higher-risk assets like Bitcoin. There’s also the proposed Big Beautiful Bill, which is expected to expand liquidity across markets, potentially spilling over into crypto. From a technical standpoint, however, Bitcoin’s price continues to be squeezed between heavy sell-side liquidity near $110,000 and a support floor around $107,000. According to the liquidation heatmap, significant short liquidation levels are stacked between $110K and $114K, creating a dense resistance wall. These layered orders are absorbing bullish momentum and forcing frequent rejections at each test of the upper band. This resistance is not limited to intraday moves. The 1-week heatmap confirms that the liquidity build-up above $110,000 is a structural zone, formed over multiple sessions. To clear it, Bitcoin would likely require a combination of rising open interest and strong spot demand, factors that remain elusive amid broader market caution. Meanwhile, profit-taking activity remains elevated, especially during New York hours, as sellers step in to cap rallies near key resistance. Spot liquidity data shows intense exchange order-book activity around $110,000, with traders hesitant to chase breakouts amid macro uncertainty. At the same time, downside risk is being cushioned by aggressive buying below $107,000. Liquidation levels and bid interest in this zone suggest that bulls are actively defending lower levels, allowing Bitcoin to bounce quickly on dips. This has resulted in a tightly wound price structure, leaving the asset vulnerable to sharp, short-lived moves on both sides. Adding to the complexity is the role of the U.S. dollar. The DXY index recently fell to its lowest level since early 2022, with analysts noting that it’s now trading near historical support versus its 200-day and 365-day moving averages. CryptoQuant data shows that this zone has historically been favourable for Bitcoin, though the current price action has yet to reflect that trend. According to QuickTake blog contributor DarkFrost, as the dollar weakens, investors often rotate toward alternative assets, a pattern that could fuel a delayed BTC rally. US Dollar Index (DXY) vs. BTC/USD. Source: CryptoQuant . “This tool serves as a valuable indicator for identifying early bull market phases and periods of euphoria, not because of pure technical triggers, but because it reflects increasing liquidity potentially flowing into crypto markets,” DarkFrost explained. What’s next for Bitcoin? Most market analysts were bullish on Bitcoin’s short- to mid-term outlook, though expectations remained measured. Many see the current chop as a reset before trend continuation, with several chart watchers flagging key signals that could confirm the next major move. According to trader BitBull, Bitcoin’s 3-day Relative Strength Index and price action were forming an inverse head and shoulders pattern, a classic bullish setup often seen ahead of major breakouts. In a post to X, he said a breakout would likely require one of two things: either a 3D close above $110K or an RSI breakout past 70.

Top altcoin gainers In the past 24 hours, the altcoin market saw a modest 1% rise, reaching $1.28 trillion, with about $18 million flowing in. The uptick coincided with a rise in the Altcoin Season Index from 22 to 27, hinting that more top 100 altcoins are starting to outpace Bitcoin. It’s a sign that investors might be slowly turning their attention away from the legacy crypto asset and showing renewed interest in the broader altcoin space. Ethereum, the leading altcoin by market capitalization, rose 3.5% over the past 24 hours to trade at $2,650. Other major altcoins, including XRP, Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Cardano (ADA), also posted gains in the 2% to 5% range. Stellar (XLM) led the gains with a 15% rise on the day, followed by Raydium and SPX6900, which followed with gains of 11.8% and nearly 9%, respectively. Source: CoinMarketCap Stellar: XLM’s price picked up pace today after the Stellar Development Foundation released a new test version of its core software, marking a major step toward a pending upgrade to the Stellar blockchain scheduled for August. The upgrade is expected to improve how the network supports smart contracts and decentralized apps, making it faster and more scalable. Project-related developments tend to spark renewed investor interest, as they signal long-term growth potential. Raydium: Raydium’s recent price uptick can be attributed to the rapid expansion of BonkFun and LaunchLab, two integrated platforms that now form the core infrastructure for meme coin activity on the Solana network. BonkFun serves as the primary launchpad for new meme tokens, while LaunchLab manages token minting, liquidity provisioning, and volume routing, functions that are fully executed through Raydium’s platform. This combined setup now facilitates over half of Solana’s meme coin activity, generating approximately $900,000 in daily fees. Of that, an estimated $110,000 is consistently allocated to buy back RAY tokens from the market. Periodic buybacks tend to generate sustained buying pressure, which is likely supporting RAY’s current price action. SPX6900: The viral memecoin is extending its rally for a third straight day despite no clear catalyst, driven by strong community support and sustained grassroots momentum. With year-to-date gains nearing 400%, long-term holder confidence and retail backing continue to fuel the memecoin’s steady climb.

2025-07-09T17:14:01,"Strategy: The Rising Cost To Common Stockholders","Summary Strategy continues its aggressive capital raises via new preferred share ATMs, fueling ongoing Bitcoin purchases. Common stock dilution and rising preferred dividends are costs for shareholders, as annual preferred dividends now exceed $315 million. MSTR trades at a significant premium to its Bitcoin holdings, making direct Bitcoin or Bitcoin ETF exposure potentially more attractive. When you think of Bitcoin USD (BTC-USD), one of the first companies that comes to mind is MicroStrategy Incorporated ( MSTR ). Once a small software firm that was relatively unheard of, now the company is one of the leading holders of the world's most prominent cryptocurrency. As management has continued to find new ways to raise capital to purchase more Bitcoin, the costs are starting to rise for those that hold the common stock. Previous coverage of the name Back in March, I took a look at where things stood with the company after its first major issuance of preferred stock . I detailed the history of Bitcoin purchases from Strategy, along with its decision to issue preferred shares in addition to its common stock at-the-market (""ATM"") sales program in order to bring in fresh capital to buy more Bitcoin. Strategy shares have done quite well since my previous article, rallying almost 50%, whereas the S&P 500 has only gained about 11%. The large rally has been mostly due to a more than 30% rise in the value of Bitcoin, which has led to a large gain in the value of the company's Bitcoin holdings. The surge in shares also may be due to investors betting on the potential for S&P 500 inclusion, which I'll discuss later. A new preferred stock ATM When I looked at Strategy back in March, the company had one class of preferred stock, called MicroStrategy Incorporated SERIES A PERP PF ( STRK ). This preferred class featured an 8% annual dividend, and the company filed an ATM to issue up to $21 billion in STRK shares. This value matches the current ongoing ATM of common shares that was established in early May, as detailed in the latest business update filing . Since my previous article, Strategy has come up with two additional classes of preferred shares, MicroStrategy Incorporated SER A PFD STK ( STRF ) and Strategy Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock ( STRD ). Both of these preferred classes each pay 10% annual dividends. An ATM program was launched for STRF back in May with a $2.1 billion value, and just this week, the STRD shares saw a $4.2 billion ATM plan announced . As of July 6th, between the four outstanding share sale programs, Strategy could issue another nearly $45 billion worth of common and preferred stock. Preferred dividends are no longer immaterial As detailed in the business update linked above, each of the three preferred classes had more than 10 million shares outstanding at the end of June, with STRK having the most at a little more than 12.2 million. Given these numbers as well as their 8% and 10% respective annual dividend rates, the chart below shows how annual run rate dividend payments have risen since the start of these programs earlier this year. The numbers are based on the share counts at the end of each respective quarter. Strategy Preferred Stock Dividend Payments (Company Filings) From the end of Q1 to the end of Q2, the annual run rate went from roughly $146 million to $316 million. As the company has previously detailed , it has used the common stock ATM to raise money for dividend payments. Strategy only had around $60 million in cash at the end of Q1 according to its quarterly filing , while the above business update detailed over $8.2 billion in total debt at the end of June. The company really doesn't produce any meaningful free cash flow, and any cash it did generate was going to Bitcoin purchases. With a market cap of about $110 billion currently between its Class A and B common stock, dilution of more than $300 million a year to pay preferred dividends doesn't seem like that much. However, the number is certainly rising, as seen above, and it could be even more material if Strategy shares were to drop. Don't forget that the company is also paying commissions of up to 2% of the gross value of shares it sells to brokers, another cost of raising funds to purchase more Bitcoin. At the end of Q2, there were more than 261 million Class A shares outstanding, up almost 15 million during the quarter. As a reminder, this number was under 96 million at the end of 2022 before the company really started diluting investors. Trading at a premium valuation At the end of June, the total value of Strategy's two common share classes and its three preferred share classes was a little over $117 billion. At that time, the value of its Bitcoin holdings was about $64 billion. If we subtract out the three preferred classes, the value of the common shares came down to around $113.5 billion. That leaves a roughly $50 billion difference to its Bitcoin holdings value. The rest of the business is certainly not worth the remainder of that, given it is showing a large revenue decline currently and is expected to report less than half a billion dollars in software sales this year. Most software companies that show decent growth can go for about 10 times revenue, but those with limited growth or even declining revenues usually go for the low-to-mid-single digits. That means the software business is worth just a couple of billion dollars at most, so investors here are basically paying about 1.7 times the value of the company's Bitcoin pile. As a pure Bitcoin play, buying the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) would seemingly be the better option. I mentioned in my previous article that new accounting rules were set to allow the company to recognize gains related to its Bitcoin holdings, which would mean the potential to report large amounts of net income. Strategy reported a more than $14 billion unrealized gain on its digital assets in Q2. Reporting positive net income could allow the stock to become a member of the S&P 500 index, which should trigger a sizable amount of institutional borrowing. Some of the premium that Strategy shares trade at currently could be due to those betting that S&P 500 inclusion will come rather soon. Final thoughts and recommendation Strategy this week announced a third ATM program for preferred shares, allowing it to raise even more capital to fund its Bitcoin purchases. However, this comes with a rising cost, as preferred stock dividend payments are now running at a more than $300 million annual pace. Selling common stock is a one-time hit to shareholders in the form of dilution, but this preferred plan has a fixed cost each and every year. If Strategy completed all three of the current preferred stock ATMs, that would result in roughly $2.3 billion in annual dividend payments. At the moment, I continue to rate the common stock as a hold. If you are a long-term believer in Bitcoin, it seems likely that Strategy shares would rise over time, but you might be better off than just buying Bitcoin directly or through one of the ETFs like IBIT. I believe that Strategy is going to continue to sell a lot of shares to purchase more Bitcoin, which likely will provide a headwind to the possible upside here. Should we see Bitcoin prices hold steady or even head higher in the next few quarters, Strategy may be worth a speculative short-term buy then if you believe the S&P 500 committee will add it to the index. However, after that potentially positive catalyst, one must wonder if the premium shares trade at its Bitcoin holdings value will eventually compress.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4800199-strategy-the-rising-cost-to-common-stockholders?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BUSINESS|BTC|STRK|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY","IBIT|MSTR|STRK|STRF|STRD",cryptocompare
2025-07-09T17:13:43,"Emirates to Accept Crypto Payments Via New Deal with Crypto.com","Emirates, the largest airline in the Middle East, is preparing to introduce cryptocurrency as a payment option for its customers. The airline’s parent company announced that it has signed a preliminary agreement with Crypto.com, a global digital currency trading platform. The deal is expected to take effect in 2026 and is part of the airline’s larger plan to adopt new technologies and offer more flexible payment choices. Emirates Embraces Crypto to Attract Next-Gen Travelers This new partnership with Crypto will allow Emirates passengers to pay for tickets and other services through the exchange’s payment system. By introducing crypto payments, Emirates aims to cater to a new generation of travelers accustomed to using digital currencies. These include young adults, remote workers, and tech-savvy customers who prefer fast and secure transactions without relying on traditional banks. The airline believes that this change will improve the overall travel experience. At the same time, attract more users who are already active in the digital economy. This move is also in line with a broader trend in the airline industry. Around the world, more airlines are starting to accept cryptocurrency to stay trendy and meet the changing needs of their customers. The UAE Is Becoming a Global Hub for Crypto Emirates’ decision comes at a time when the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is strengthening its role in the global digital asset market. The country has created a welcoming environment for crypto businesses , especially in Dubai. The government has introduced clear rules and systems to support the virtual asset industry. In 2022, Dubai launched the Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority, also known as VARA. This regulatory body is responsible for overseeing the cryptocurrency sector and ensuring that companies follow proper regulations. As a result, more than 650 crypto companies are now based in one of Dubai’s main business zones, the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC). These firms operate in various areas, including real estate, school payments, and transportation services. Most recently, Dubai’s Financial Services Authority (DFSA) approved QCDT, the first tokenized money market fund in the region. This move aims to strengthen the city’s role as a leader in digital finance and Web3 innovation. More Airlines Across the Region Are Adopting Crypto Emirates is not alone in its move toward digital currencies. In May, another airline in the region, Air Arabia, announced that it would start accepting cryptocurrency payments through a local digital currency. This coin, known as AE Coin, is backed by the UAE dirham and can be used to book flights. This shows that the use of digital currencies is becoming more common in the travel and airline industries. Airlines are seeing the benefits of offering their customers more modern, fast, and flexible payment options. As more people become familiar with cryptocurrency, an increasing number of airlines will likely follow this path.

Skylar Montgomery Koning tells Bloomberg that the dollar has already priced in the negative impact of President Donald Trump’s tariffs in its 10% drop year-to-date, noting that the greenback is primed to rise in value against foreign currencies. “The fact that some of the more problematic policies from the US administration have been dialed back – and there are deals getting done – means that the economic pain for the US won’t be as bad as originally feared.” The US dollar index (DXY) is trading at 97.57 at time of writing. The USD outlook of Barclays comes after the US dollar printed its worst first-half performance in over 50 years. The DXY plunged nearly 11% from January to June of this year, marking its steepest decline since the first six months of 1973 when the index dropped by 14.8%. Meanwhile, Kathy Jones, a chief fixed income strategist at the financial services giant Charles Schwab, tells Bloomberg Television that US trade policies and their resulting inflation could delay anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts until December or next year. Rate cuts tend to devalue the dollar. Conversely, the CME FedWatch Tool estimates there’s a 62.7% chance the Fed will cut the rate by 25 basis points at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in September.

2025-07-09T16:39:09,"XRP Price Prediction: Analyst Spots 2017 Setup on XRP Chart – New All-Time High Could Be Days Away","The XRP price has bounced by 2.5% in the past 24 hours, rising to $2.34 as the crypto market as a whole drops by the same percentage today. XRP is now up by 6.5% in the past week and by 7% in the past fortnight, with the altcoin also sitting on a 435% increase over the last 12 months. This is impressive performance, but some traders are expecting the coin to do even better things in the coming months, with one analyst on X – Charting Guy – pointing out that XRP’s chart this year is replicating the patterns of 2017/18. This was when XRP reached a record high of $3.40, and given the alt’s fundamentals and Ripple’s growth this year, there’s every chance that it could hit a new ATH by the winter. XRP Price Prediction: Analyst Spots 2017 Setup on XRP Chart – New All-Time High Could Be Days Away This week, the aforementioned Charting Guy posted a chart which superimposed XRP’s 2017/18 price action onto its performance over the previous year. The overlap is considerable, with the recent highs in December and January lining up with the highs in December 2017 and January 2018. $XRPBTC 2017 fractal zoomed in literally couldn’t be more accurate got the December high and January high TO THE EXACT DAY, let’s see how these next few months go (fractal is about timing, direction, and structure, not exact price) https://t.co/04PjMGJxsz pic.twitter.com/FA6cdD6eJY — Charting Guy (@ChartingGuy) July 6, 2025 However, the XRP price suffered a big drop in August 2018, before rebounding into September. And while XRP did recover in September 2018, we should note that the chart above is for XRP-Bitcoin, and not for XRP-USD (which witnessed continued declines after September’s rebound). As such, Charting Guy’s parallels aren’t perhaps helpful for the present day, which differs from 2018 in that cryptocurrency adoption has increased considerably. This means that we could expect the XRP price to recover in the later months of the year, perhaps after the US has sorted out its ongoing tariff issues with the rest of the world. Source: TradingView If we look at its chart today, we see that XRP is already beginning to recover some lost momentum. Perhaps most notably, it has broken through the pennant its highs and lows had formed over the past six months or so, a sign that it may now be pushing on to a new, higher level. We also see its RSI (yellow) climbing to 60 and moving upwards, while its MACD (orange, blue) has just turned positive for the first time since late May. These are all positive signs, and they suggest that the XRP price could hit $2.50 again in the next few weeks, before plowing on to $3 by Q4. And if the final quarter of the year does witness XRP ETF approvals , then the coin could pass $3.50. Bitcoin Hyper Raises $2.1 For BTC Layer-Two Network: Is This the Best New Platform of 2025? While XRP looks ready to do good things later this year, many traders may want to diversify into newer coins, so as to increase their exposure to potential upside. There’s no shortage of new, high-potential coins at the moment, with some of the most promising examples being presale coins. One of the most interesting of these is Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), an ERC-20 crypto that has now raised just over $2.1 million in its ICO. Bitcoin Hyper is in the process of developing its own layer-two network for Bitcoin, which perhaps explains why so many investors are rushing to join its presale. As an L2, Bitcoin Hyper will provide much lower transaction fees and much higher throughput than users would get from Bitcoin itself. It provides instant bridging to and from its parent chain, with deposited BTC being converted into an ERC equivalent for use on Bitcoin Hyper’s network. Its network will be compatible with Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), giving it a high level of performance and compatibility. As for its native HYPER token, it will be necessary to pay for its transaction fees, while holders will also be able to stake it for passive income. With over 13,000 followers on X , Bitcoin Hyper is already proving popular, with investors able to join its presale by going to the Bitcoin Hyper website . HYPER currently costs $0.0122, although this will rise again in just under two days.

2025-07-09T16:32:39,"Cronos Jumps 18% After Trump Media ETF Proposal Lists Token Among Holdings","Cronos (CRO), the native token of the Crypto.com blockchain, surged nearly 18% to $0.095 Wednesday following news that it could be included in a new exchange-traded fund (ETF) backed by Trump Media & Technology Group. The proposed ETF, which is awaiting approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, would track a basket of five cryptocurrencies: bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), solana (SOL), XRP (XRP) and cronos (CRO). If approved, CRO would make up 5% of the fund’s weighting—its smallest component, but still a notable addition for a token that’s rarely featured in major institutional products. That news sent CRO soaring from about $0.08 Tuesday morning, outpacing the broader crypto market. The CoinDesk 20 Index, which tracks the top digital assets, rose just 2.8% over the same period. While the bump is significant, CRO remains a shadow of its former self. The token peaked at $0.69 in November 2021 during the last bull market. It saw a short-lived revival in December 2024, rising to $0.21 amid a market rally that followed Donald Trump’s election to a second term. That rally, however, faded fast. The ETF development has brought new attention to CRO, a token that powers Crypto.com’s ecosystem including its exchange and payments app. Still, the token has a long climb to reach its former highs. Traders appear to be reacting to the possibility of increased institutional exposure, but the SEC has yet to approve the fund.

2025-07-09T16:30:15,"Bitcoin Asia 2025: Eric Trump To Address Hong Kong’s Growing Role In Crypto","Eric Trump, son of President Donald Trump, is set to make headlines next month when speaking at the Bitcoin Asia 2025 conference in Hong Kong, amid the presidential family’s growing interest in digital assets. This event aims to establish the city as a leading hub for digital assets, competing directly with the United States. Under President Trump’s second administration, the United States has made considerable progress in regulating the growth of the crypto market. A Rising Advocate For Bitcoin And Digital Assets In his address, Eric Trump will reportedly explore the long-term potential of Bitcoin, its implications for global finance, and the role Asia plays in shaping the future of Bitcoin adoption, announced by BTC Inc, the organization behind the conference. Bitcoin Asia is the regional edition of the Bitcoin Conference, one of the largest cryptocurrency events worldwide. The conference made its debut in Hong Kong last May, coinciding with the city’s efforts to cultivate its digital asset sector. Eric Trump, who co-founded the Bitcoin-mining venture American Bitcoin and is involved in the Trump family-backed initiative World Liberty Financial (WLFI), has been recognized as a prominent advocate for the industry on the international stage. Hong Kong Aims For Crypto Dominance Trump’s participation comes at a pivotal time as Hong Kong intensifies its campaign to become a global leader in digital assets . This ambition aligns with the US government’s goal—during his father’s administration—to establish America as the “crypto capital of the planet.” In June, Hong Kong released its “Policy Statement 2.0 on the Development of Digital Assets,” which builds on a blueprint issued in late 2022. This policy outlines the city’s commitment to enhancing its digital asset infrastructure and achieving “new heights of global digital asset leadership.” The competition for a first-mover advantage in the digital asset space is heating up, particularly as both Hong Kong and the US advance towards the legalization of stablecoins. US crypto investors are awaiting the approval of bills such as the GENIUS Act and the CLARITY Act by the House. These bills have already secured Senate approval and are awaiting the next move from the House of Representatives before Trump’s signature. Last year’s Bitcoin Asia conference attracted over 5,500 participants at the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal, with about half of the attendees coming from mainland China. This year, the event is scheduled to take place at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai on August 28 and 29. When writing, Bitcoin trades at $108,370, down just 3% from its all-time high of $111,800 reached during May’s bullish rally for the crypto market.

2025-07-09T16:29:24,"The Protocol: Vitalik Buterin's Latest Proposal – Transaction Gas Cap","Welcome to The Protocol, CoinDesk's weekly wrap-up of the most important stories in cryptocurrency tech development. I'm Margaux Nijkerk, CoinDesk’s Tech & Protocols reporter. In this issue: Vitalik Buterin's New Proposal Seeks 16.7M Gas Cap on Ethereum to Rein In Transaction Bloat Jack Dorsey Unveils Bitchat: Offline, Encrypted Messaging Inspired by Bitcoin Volkswagen ADMT Taps Solana-Based Hivemapper Bee Maps for Driverless Data Eigen Labs Axes 25% of Staff to Focus on Building EigenCloud Unknown block type ""divider"", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option Network News NEW ETHEREUM PROPOSAL FROM VITALIK BUTERIN: A new Ethereum proposal , co-authored by Vitalik Buterin and Toni Wahrstaetter, aims to impose a hard cap on the maximum gas a transaction can consume in a move developers say could strengthen network stability and make the chain more viable for certain applications. The proposal, EIP-7983, suggests limiting individual transactions to 16,777,216 gas (2²⁴) — a sharp change from the current design, which technically allows a single transaction to consume the gas allocation of an entire block. As a design choice, that introduces several performance and security challenges. When a single transaction consumes nearly all the available gas, it disrupts the distribution of workloads across the network and tends to make block execution less efficient. So the proposed cap is expected to simplify engineering challenges and aligns with Ethereum's shift toward modularity, though it may require splitting large transactions. — Shaurya Malwa Read more . JACK DORSEY UNVEILS BITCHAT WHITEPAPER : Jack Dorsey, founder of Twitter (now X) and fintech company Block (SQ), published a whitepaper for Bitchat, a decentralized messaging protocol that enables fully encrypted communication without the internet. Bitchat would operate over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), allowing nearby devices to form a mesh network that relays messages hop-by-hop, according to the whitepaper . When a message is sent, it would travel across nearby devices acting as temporary nodes until it reaches its recipient, making it resilient in offline or censored environments. While not making explicit references to Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency or the blockchain, Dorsey describes Bitchat as a ""decentralized, peer-to-peer messaging application,"" evoking connections to the Bitcoin whitepaper's intro in which it was described as a ""peer-to-peer version of electronic cash."" — Jamie Crawley Read more . SOLANA HIVEMAPPER AND VOLKSWAGEN TEAM UP : Volkswagen ADMT, the carmaker’s autonomous-vehicle testing subsidiary, tapped Hivemapper’s Bee Maps to support its self-driving operations with real-time mapping data. Street-level imagery collected by Bee Maps contributors using Hivemapper cameras will be used to help validate Volkswagen’s self-driving technology in an effort to boost the curbside precision of autonomous pick-ups and drop-offs, a Bee Maps spokesperson told CoinDesk. The deal highlights the growing adoption of crowdsourced geospatial data as autonomous ride-sharing firms look for more precise, up-to-date mapping infrastructure. It also showcases the growth of decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), which use blockchain incentives to crowdsource real-world data collection. Hivemapper is one of the best-known DePIN projects in the Solana ecosystem. According to the Wall Street Journal , Volkswagen’s autonomous driving unit has been testing its ‘Robotaxi’ fleet in recent months. In April, the company also announced a partnership with Uber to launch the service in U.S. markets, with pilot operations set for late 2025 and a wider rollout planned for 2026. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more . EIGENLABS LAYS OFF STAFF AMID RESTRUCTURE: Eigen Labs, the main developer firm behind restaking protocol EigenLayer, cut its workforce by 25%, losing 29 roles, as CEO Sreeram Kannan said he restructured the company to focus on developing EigenCloud , which he called a “verifiable” alternative to existing, opaque cloud services. The Seattle-based startup said the dismissals were not a cash-crunch response. The news comes as the firm has dealt with its fair share of blowback, from not having certain key mechanisms in place at the launch of its main product, to having leading Ethereum Foundation figures receive big payouts for advisory roles. EigenLayer was once one of the buzziest projects in crypto, reaching $20 billion i n total value locked in June 2024 . It now has $12 billion. — Francisco Rodrigues Read more .

At a status conference in Manhattan on Tuesday, District Judge Katherine Polk Failla initially waffled on whether she would allow expert witnesses to testify about the sanctions, which were first imposed in August 2022, removed this March and subsequently found illegal by a Texas court. After hearing arguments from both prosecution and defense, Failla decided to grant Storm’s motion in limine moving to prohibit testimony about the sanctions entirely, arguing that it would simply be too confusing for a jury to do what she described as the “mental gymnastics” of understanding why the sanctions were imposed and ultimately removed. — Cheyenne Ligon Read more .

The price increase is part of the project’s pre-launch phase, which began on April 1. Husky Inu’s presale and pre-launch phases have helped the project raise $810,831 so far. Husky Inu’s (HINU) Latest Price Jump Husky Inu (HINU) has registered its latest price increase, rising from $0.00018632 to $0.00018686.

The pre-launch phase aims to empower the fledgling Husky Inu community, allowing the project to continue its fundraising efforts as its launch date draws closer. The pre-launch phase is the next step in the project’s roadmap, allowing it to raise capital to fund platform improvements, ongoing developments, marketing initiatives, and broader ecosystem expansion. A Dynamic Pricing Strategy Husky Inu (HINU) adopted a dynamic pricing strategy during the pre-launch phase, with the HINU token price rising every two days. This strategy has been instrumental in the project’s fundraising efforts, helping it cross the $800,000 milestone.

2025-07-09T16:15:23,"Bitcoin May Not Close at $250,000 This Year, But this Analyst is Convinced BTC Can Hit These Levels‬","Bitcoin has managed to return above the $100,000 price mark after revisiting previous support levels at $98,286. While somewhat mixed, market sentiments remain bullish as a handful of Bitcoin proponents have reiterated their conviction that the asset could reach previously unseen levels before the end of the year. Although the most bullish price forecasts for Bitcoin this year has typically started with a base price of $200,000, with pro-Bitcoin proponents like Robert Kiyosaki predicting $250,000 as a closing price for Bitcoin this year, one investor is outlining an interesting scenario for the asset, with price expectations going above the $150,000 mark but not at all crossing the $200,000 price level this year. According to Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research, Bitcoin could increase its price value by 48.56% from its current level. Lee observed Bitcoin’s recent upward correction, explaining that ETF inflows contributed largely to the asset’s recovery. Notably, U.S.-based Bitcoin ETFs saw the largest single-day inflow on Tuesday, June 28, with a total of $588.6 million recorded, according to data from Farside Investors. The new development marks 11 days of consecutive positive inflows—the longest period of consistent inflows recorded since December 2024. Although Lee maintains that investors are exercising caution at this time, he predicts that Bitcoin is still well on its way to hitting new highs this year. According to his timeline, Bitcoin could secure a price value of $110,000-$115,000 within the third quarter of this year. His year-end price prediction $130,000-$160,000 is even more bullish. For Ether, the second most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap, Lee predicts a $2,600-$2,800 attainable short-term target for the asset, but with increased expectations, he forecasts $5,500 as a long-term target. At the time of this report, Bitcoin is up 0.95% from the previous day and is currently trading at $109,152 at press time.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-may-not-close-at-250000-this-year-but-this-analyst-is-convinced-btc-can-hit-these-levels/,"BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET|EXCHANGE","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare

The rally coincides with Grayscale's quarterly rebalancing, positioning NEAR at 28.41% of its Decentralized AI Fund. The move comes amid renewed optimism across the altcoin sector, with analysts calling for a long-awaited ""altcoin season,"" which would likely occur if bitcoin (BTC) breaks a new record high and consolidates, prompting a capital flow to altcoins.

Token swings $0.14 or 6.20% between $2.15 low and $2.29 peak. 17:00 hour sees 4.16 million unit surge, driving price from $2.18 to $2.23. Spike exceeds 24-hour average of 1.87 million units.

2025-07-09T16:08:36,"BTC Stalls Just Below $110,000 Amidst Heavy Sell Pressure","Bitcoin made an ambitious push toward the $110,000 mark on July 9, but selling pressure halted its advance just short of the milestone. BTC/USD peaked at $109,777 on Bitstamp before reversing, according to data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView. The price remains constrained within a tight range, with liquidity clustering at key levels. Order book data from CoinGlass indicated strong buying interest around $108,500 and heavy sell pressure near $110,500, which appears to be capping further gains for now. Traders Signal Caution as Liquidity Concentrates Despite the temporary pullback, many market participants are optimistic that Bitcoin may be preparing for another rally. Trader Jelle noted the heavy liquidity above $110,000 and suggested a successful breakout could quickly push the price much higher. “Almost all liquidity is to the upside. Stops above $110k are not safe,” he commented on X, forecasting a possible move to $130,000 if the resistance is broken. Analyst BitBull highlighted technical indicators that might support this bullish scenario. He pointed to a potential inverse head and shoulders pattern on the 3-day RSI and price charts. “For breakout, we need one of these 2 things. Either a 3D close above $110K or a 3D RSI close above 70. After that, we’ll experience an up-only rally for 3-4 weeks,” he explained. Volatility Expected as Macro Factors Weigh on Sentiment Beyond technicals, broader macroeconomic factors are also expected to influence Bitcoin’s short-term trajectory. QCP Capital, in its latest bulletin to Telegram subscribers, said the upcoming U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report could introduce volatility in the crypto and equities markets. The firm emphasized that recent strong jobs data had already cooled optimism around near-term interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. “Markets have scaled back expectations to two cuts in 2025, down from 2.5 previously. A July cut is all but priced out. September odds have slipped from 90% to 70%,” the bulletin noted. This shift in expectations has placed additional focus on upcoming economic data releases. Despite these uncertainties, QCP described Bitcoin as “well bid,” supported by institutional inflows and a weakening U.S. dollar. “With a reignited trade war, a more hawkish Fed, and tightening liquidity conditions, the stage is set for elevated volatility,” the firm added. “Macro catalysts are lining up. Buckle up,” QCP concluded. Outlook Hinges on Breaking $110K While BTC has so far failed to close above $110,000 since June 11, traders remain alert for a breakout that could mark the beginning of a stronger bullish trend. The presence of sell-side liquidity above the current level continues to pose a challenge, but the alignment of technical signals and macroeconomic catalysts may offer enough fuel for Bitcoin to attempt another leg higher. Until then, investors appear to be watching liquidity zones and upcoming inflation data closely for signs of the next major move.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/btc-stalls-just-below-110000-amidst-heavy-sell-pressure/,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|FIAT","Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence",cryptocompare
