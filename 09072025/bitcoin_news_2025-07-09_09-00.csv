2025-07-09T06:57:46,"Tether CEO Says “We Will Be the Largest Bitcoin Miner by the End of 2025”","The post Tether CEO Says “We Will Be the Largest Bitcoin Miner by the End of 2025” appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin USDT, is gearing up for a dramatic shift in strategy. While regulatory pressure builds under the newly passed GENIUS Act in the U.S., CEO Paolo Ardoino has revealed bold plans to make Tether the largest Bitcoin miner in the world by the end of 2025. This comes alongside its efforts to launch a fully compliant U.S.-based stablecoin amid growing scrutiny. With the Senate passing the “Genius Act,” Paolo expressed optimism. He believes the legislation will create a global compliance framework for stablecoins, both domestic and foreign. Tether plans to align its current USDT token with these new standards and also launch a new onshore stablecoin tailored for the U.S. market. From Stablecoins to Mining Powerhouse Speaking on a recent Bankless podcast with Ryan Sean Adams, Ardoino shared that Tether is investing heavily in Bitcoin mining, alongside ventures in AI, telecommunications, and data centers. With over $10 billion in Bitcoin holdings, Ardoino stressed the importance of protecting the network that underpins Tether’s balance sheet. By becoming a top miner, Tether hopes to safeguard its interests from potential manipulation and centralization risks. Ardoino confidently stated, “Realistically, by the end of this year, Tether will become the biggest bitcoin miner out there.” The Billion-Dollar Mining Bet Despite strong competition from established mining giants like Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms, Tether has made significant progress through partnerships with Latin American governments, including El Salvador, Paraguay, and Uruguay. With over 15 mining facilities already under its belt, the company has quietly poured billions into expanding its mining infrastructure. Still, questions remain, as Tether has yet to disclose its share of the total Bitcoin hashrate. GENIUS Act Forces Strategic Changes While Tether aims to lead in mining, it’s also being forced to navigate new regulatory hurdles in the U.S. The GENIUS Act, passed in June 2025, demands full reserve backing, AML/KYC compliance, and transparency from all stablecoin issuers. Tether has 18 to 36 months to comply or face expulsion from the U.S. market. On the flip side, the company worked alongside the U.S. Department of Justice to help freeze illicit funds using its blockchain monitoring systems. He noted that Tether has collaborated with over 250 law enforcement agencies globally, an unmatched record in the crypto world. What’s Next? Tether must now choose between revamping USDT to meet U.S. standards, launching a new regulated stablecoin, or withdrawing from the American market. Meanwhile, competitors like USDC and RLUSD are primed to capitalize on any misstep. Overall, one thing is clear that Tether is no longer just a stablecoin issuer, but a major player betting big on Bitcoin’s infrastructure.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/tether-ceo-says-we-will-be-the-largest-bitcoin-miner-by-the-end-of-2025/,"USDT|BTC|MINING|MARKET|REGULATION","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare
2025-07-09T06:53:10,"Pi Network Mainnet Surges With 9,120 AI Apps and 30 Live Projects","The post Pi Network Mainnet Surges With 9,120 AI Apps and 30 Live Projects appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Pi Network is booming! At the Pi2Day 2025 event, the team unveiled a breakthrough: over 9,120 AI-generated apps were built using its no-code App Studio . With at least 30 apps already live on the mainnet, Pi Network is rapidly evolving into one of the most vibrant ecosystems in Web3 . 13.7M Pi Users On Mainnet As of now, 13.7 million Pi users have completed KYC and migrated to the mainnet, actively using Pi-powered applications. This massive user base is fueling the growth of Pi’s ecosystem. Top AI Apps Live on the Pi Network Mainnet Here are some of the standout apps already running on the Pi mainnet: Map of Pi – A marketplace where users can buy and sell real-world services using Pi, displayed on an interactive map. Fruity Pi – A fun, fruit-merging game that integrates Pi for gaming rewards. CARE FOR PI – A community-driven app likely aimed at charitable and support-based services. Link for Pi – A social networking app designed for Pi users to connect and collaborate. LatinChain Platform – A gaming and entertainment platform that supports in-game purchases with Pi. It was also a Pi Hackathon winner. These apps demonstrate the utility of Pi in various sectors — from e-commerce to gaming and social networking. Is There a Limit to App Submissions? Crypto commentator Dr. Altcoin recently suggested there may be a limit of 8,430 apps accepted into the App Studio. This sparked concerns among developers, but so far, no official confirmation has been provided by the Pi Core Team. Still, the concern raises valid questions about scalability and how the platform will manage the influx of new apps. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pi Network Price Today, Pi Coin News , Pi Network Listing and More , What Is Ecosystem Directory Staking? Another key update from the event is the Ecosystem Directory Staking model. Users can stake Pi tokens to boost their favorite apps’ visibility in the Pi App Store. No extra Pi rewards are given for staking. Developers can offer custom incentives to attract stakers. This approach gives users a say in shaping the app ecosystem while rewarding innovation and real utility. Final Thoughts: Can Pi Network Handle the Growth? With thousands of AI-generated apps and millions of verified users, Pi Network is entering a critical growth phase. While it’s creating exciting opportunities, questions about platform limits and infrastructure readiness remain.But one thing is clear — Pi Network is no longer just a test project. It’s building a live, AI-powered app ecosystem, and all eyes are now on how it scales. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-09T06:49:35,"Are Bitcoin treasury companies a new bubble akin to the ICO boom? Critics and industry leaders see similarities","As Bitcoin treasury companies are becoming the new initial coin offerings, people are starting to remember how it all ended in 2018. While ICOs and Bitcoin treasury companies are definitely not the same, critics outline some similarities. More than that, recently, the CEO of the treasury company Nakamoto, David Bailey, compared his business to “the early day ICOs.” Calling something a bubble until it bursts may not be correct, but it is possible to point out similarities and differences between ICOs and treasuries to test the potential future of the latter. The rise of Bitcoin treasury companies MicroStrategy was founded in 1989, and since then, it has tested several grounds. Only in 2020 did MicroStrategy focus on issuing debt to buy bitcoin, promising its shareholders indirect exposure to owning BTC held by the company. In 2025, the company changed its name to Strategy. Strategy attracted attention. MSTR stock’s value has gained 500% since early 2024. Investors who don’t want or cannot (because of the laws) buy BTC directly but want to enjoy yield on growth opportunities. After Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 election and a new round of interest in Bitcoin, Bitcoin treasury companies began to emerge with ever-increasing speed. Multi-million dollar purchases of Bitcoin decrease BTC price volatility, creating increased demand for it. Strategy alone bought more Bitcoin in 2025 than miners produced. Such terms as “supply shock” and “opportunity cost” reflect how reluctant people become to sell any amount of BTC. Just like Strategy chair Michael Saylor is advocating for Bitcoin and Strategy online and offline on a daily basis, Strategy copycats rely on influencers in the crypto sector to promote their stocks. ProCap BTC is headed by Anthony Pompliano, Metaplanet’s voice is Simon Gerovich, XXI Capital hired a Strike CEO, Jack Mallers, while Nakamoto is helmed by Bitcoin Magazine CEO David Bailey, etc. All of these companies were founded or fully switched to a Bitcoin purchasing strategy in 2024 or 2025. Read more: Inspired by Saylor’s Strategy, TopWin shifts to digital assets by rebranding to ‘AsiaStrategy’ Interestingly enough, Bitcoin treasuries do not offer their clients any type of interaction with cryptocurrencies and do not hold crypto themselves. Instead, they outsource it to Coinbase and other centralized exchanges. What do ICOs and Bitcoin treasury companies have in common? While most crypto influencers are busy highlighting the growth of Bitcoin treasuries’ BTC holdings and presenting new purchases as “bullish,” many in the crypto community find the latest trend disturbing. They emphasize that these companies are rooted in TradFi and present regular public and private companies, except that they don’t produce anything and just buy Bitcoin using borrowed assets. “Bitcoin Treasury Company” Translation: We don’t build anything…we just bought Bitcoin and want your money too. This smells like 2017 ICO season in a new outfit. Spoiler: it won’t end well. pic.twitter.com/8gV19pPo9g — GG (@YourBTCStory) July 5, 2025 More than that, critics are concerned about possible risks as all these companies are centralized. As many of them are seemingly driven by FOMO and don’t have elaborate risk management strategies, they may end up not as sustainable as Strategy who managed to survive the 2022 crypto winter. Experts warn that newer companies may have to sell their bitcoins when the bear market starts. If it happens, it may trigger the ripple effect that would impact giants, including Strategy. Some compare Bitcoin treasury companies’ hype with the ICO era hype and remind everyone that it ended in a disaster. In 2018, the crypto market lost 85% of its value. This crash was harder than the market crash associated with the dot-com bubble burst that triggered a 78% drop. By December 2017, less than a third of companies that ran ICOs reached the goals of their campaigns. Proponents of Bitcoin treasuries notice that comparing ICOs and treasuries is not correct. The line between the two is that Bitcoin treasuries are legitimate public and private companies that allow their clients to benefit from Bitcoin price movements through a standard method, such as shares. At the same time, ICOs were dubious firms that just promised to create something valuable–”were selling vaporware,” as Joe Consorti, working for Theya and Horizon, put it in his tweet. Bitcoin Treasury Companies are not ""a new ICO bubble."" One uses strategic leverage funded in capital markets to acquire bitcoin for their shareholders. The other used false pretenses to sell vaporware to unassuming retail investors. Two different worlds. — Joe Consorti ⚡️ (@JoeConsorti) July 6, 2025 However, many in the crypto community outline various similarities between ICOs and treasuries. First off, unlike the trustless Bitcoin network, ICOs and treasuries involve trust. The companies in the ICO era managed to raise capital because they were able to convince many retail investors that they would release a strong product and their tokens would skyrocket. The treasury companies’ investors trust that these companies are not going to sell their bitcoins (Saylor and Gerovich both state they are never going to sell bitcoins ) or dilute their assets further. Lack of transparency on Bitcoin holdings of these companies increases the role of trust for their investors. Companies that held ICO campaigns and modern-day treasuries are accused of insider trading, lack of vesting period, lack of competence (in certain instances), the rug-pull potential, etc. For Bitcoin purists, the need to “trust” someone is an inherent flaw of any new trendy novelty on the market. I honestly haven't been toxic enough this cycle. No bitcoiner should trade away their self-sovereignty for your Faketoshi Nakamoto Corp’s issued trustmebro garbage Bitcoin is sound money. Just because a stock owns bitcoin, it doesn't mean that stock is now ultrasound money. https://t.co/Fr1oAaCXGQ — Pledditor (@Pledditor) June 16, 2025 A founder of the company Stack Wisely who uses the moniker Stack Hodler, explained why he gets the ICO vibes from the Bitcoin treasury companies’ hype, calling these companies “this cycle’s shitcoins.” According to Stack Hodler, “These companies are creating shares out of thin air to sell to people hoping to outperform Bitcoin.” As a healthy alternative to treasuries, Stack Hodler sees “businesses that create economic value via products and services, and then store their profits in Bitcoin,” adding that it “will bring lasting value to the Bitcoin network.” Bitcoin treasury companies are this cycle's shitcoins. Think about it: These companies are creating shares out of thin air to sell to people hoping to outperform Bitcoin. That's their product. It's just TradFi shitcoinery. And many will get rekt. The good news for now is that… pic.twitter.com/3HaRJESQXH — Stack Hodler (@stackhodler) May 13, 2025 Finally, David Bailey of a Bitcoin treasury company called Nakamoto found no better comparison of how he feels about making treasury business than saying, “it’s kind of like the early day ICOs.” Probably, he wasn’t thinking about how this era ended when he remarked. Here’s what he said: “It’s kind of like early days ICOs, where you have a posse of people you bring into that token. We have a posse of people that we are bringing into the treasury companies. We have the best practices nailed down on how to do it.” The anatomy of how a conman orchestrates pump and dump scams. This video will be used as evidence in a future court of law. pic.twitter.com/AkIAfGM9T7 — Justin Bechler (@1914ad) June 29, 2025 While some critics see Strategy as an outstanding treasury that deserves trust, others dismiss all the treasury companies altogether. Usually, critics don’t pay attention to the fact that some institutions cannot hold bitcoins directly; however, many of their arguments hit the mark. Another frequent comparison is SPACs, blank companies selling shares and promises. The discussion continues. However, the Bitcoin maxis’ voices have been on the rise as of late. Here’s what Scott Melker, known as the host of the Wolf of All Streets podcast, wrote in his newsletter after suggesting that many crypto treasury companies are scams: “I’m not here to tell any of you to stop trading or speculating if you know what you’re doing. Find your edge. Use it. But if you’re not truly confident, here’s the simple play: buy the assets these companies are speculating on – primarily Bitcoin. Forget the 20x, the 50x, the 100x dreams. Buy Bitcoin. It’s still going to $1 million even if the entire treasury narrative blows up in our faces.” You might also like: Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley explains why Bitcoin is going to reach $1,000,000",crypto_news,https://crypto.news/are-bitcoin-treasury-companies-a-new-bubble-akin-to-the-ico-boom-critics-and-industry-leaders-see-similarities/,"BTC|REGULATION|TOKEN SALE|BUSINESS|ZRX","Feature|ICO|michael saylor|stocks|Wall Street",cryptocompare

What Do The US Federal Agencies Think About Crypto in 2025? SEC: The SEC, under new leadership, is moving away from aggressive enforcement and toward developing clear regulatory lines, realistic registration paths, and sensible disclosure guidelines for crypto assets. CFTC: The CFTC is collaborating with the SEC and Congress to clarify jurisdiction, especially over digital commodities and derivatives. FinCEN: AML and CFT requirements remain central, with crypto companies classified as financial institutions under the Bank Secrecy Act, subject to strict compliance. FDIC/OCC: The FDIC has eased restrictions on banks’ crypto activities, while the OCC supports banks’ ability to custody digital assets US Crypto Tax 2025 Cryptocurrency in the US is taxed based on how long you hold the asset and your total taxable income. Short-term gains (assets held for one year or less) are taxed at ordinary income rates, while long-term gains (assets held for more than a year) are taxed at lower capital gains rates. Additionally, income from mining, staking, or receiving crypto as payment is taxed as ordinary income. Short-Term Crypto Tax Rates (Held ≤ 1 Year) Tax Rate Single Married Filing Jointly Married Filing Separately Head of Household 10% $0–$11,600 $0–$23,200 $0–$11,600 $0–$16,550 12% $11,601–$47,150 $23,201–$94,300 $11,601–$47,150 $16,551–$63,100 22% $47,151–$100,525 $94,301–$201,050 $47,151–$100,525 $63,101–$100,500 24% $100,526–$191,950 $201,051–$383,900 $100,526–$191,950 $100,501–$191,950 32% $191,951–$243,725 $383,901–$487,450 $191,951–$243,725 $191,951–$243,700 37% Over $609,351 Over $731,201 Over $365,601 Over $609,351 Long-Term Crypto Tax Rates (Held > 1 Year) Tax Rate Single Married Filing Jointly Married Filing Separately Head of Household 0% Up to $47,025 Up to $94,050 Up to $47,025 Up to $63,000 15% $47,026–$518,900 $94,051–$583,750 $47,026–$291,850 $63,001–$551,350 20% Over $518,900 Over $583,750 Over $291,850 Over $551,350 Additional Crypto Tax Rules Income from mining, staking, or payment: Taxed as ordinary income at the above rates. NFTs: Some may be taxed at a higher collectibles rate (up to 28%). Non-taxable events: Transfers between your own wallets and certain gifts are not taxable.

Example If you are single, earn $50,000 in total taxable income, and realize $5,000 short-term crypto gains and $10,000 long-term crypto gains: Short-term gains taxed at 22%: $1,100 Long-term gains taxed at 15%: $1,500 Total crypto tax owed: $2,600 These rates and rules ensure all crypto investors and companies are taxed in line with other property and investment assets in the US Crypto Adoption Rate In America In 2025, about 28% of American adults—around 65 million people—own cryptocurrency. Crypto ownership in the US has nearly doubled since 2021, rising from 15% to 28%. 14% of non-owners plan to buy crypto in 2025, and 67% of current owners plan to buy more this year. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin are the top three cryptocurrencies Americans plan to purchase in 2025. Crypto mining in the USA In 2025, the US leads the world in Bitcoin mining , accounting for over one-third of global mining power. On March 20, 2025, the SEC clarified that proof-of-work crypto mining is not subject to federal securities laws, removing registration requirements for miners. There is no federal ban on crypto mining; regulation is handled at the state level, with some states offering incentives and others imposing environmental restrictions. The Trump administration’s deregulatory approach in 2025 has encouraged domestic mining growth, but all miners must still comply with federal AML and CFT rules. Environmental concerns and energy usage debates continue, especially in states considering stricter oversight or moratoriums on mining operations. US Government’s Crypto Holdings As of April 2025, the US government holds approximately 198,012 Bitcoins, valued at about $18.3 billion. The US is the world’s largest state holder of Bitcoin, with these assets primarily acquired through law enforcement seizures and forfeitures. In March 2025, President Trump established the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a broader Digital Asset Stockpile, consolidating all federally held Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies (including Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and XRP) as permanent reserve assets. Conclusion US crypto regulation in 2025 marks a major turning point. The old approach of punishing innovation is being replaced with clear rules, legal support, and a national strategy for digital assets. While financial crimes are still a concern, the overall direction is bold, business-friendly, and built for long-term crypto adoption. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-09T06:31:45,"South Korea to reclassify crypto firms as startups eligible for tax cuts and other benefits","South Korea’s startup ministry proposed a new law revision that would allow crypto firms to register as venture companies. This reclassification would grant them tax reductions and other benefits. According to a notice published on July 9, the country’s Ministry of Small-Medium Enterprises and Startups proposed to amend the “Special Act on Promoting Venture Businesses.” The amendment would have digital asset firms and other crypto-affiliated business operators no longer be restricted from registering as a venture companies. Entities registered as venture businesses in South Korea are typically small and medium-sized enterprises or startups . These companies receive official certification from the government and are eligible for government subsidies such as tax cuts and financial support depending on factors like investment or technological advancement. “[The amendment] will lead to the activation and expansion of the venture ecosystem and promote the fostering of the virtual asset industry,” wrote the ministry in its notice. Before the amendment, crypto firms were banned from registering under the venture companies category. They were placed in the list of banned businesses that include gambling facilities, which are still deterred from registering for certification. You might also like: South Korean authorities seize $3.2m worth of crypto from fake crypto exchanges Back in 2018, Upbit’s parent company Dunamu was burdened with an additional $18 million in corporate tax due to having its venture business certification revoked by the government. Therefore, it had to forfeit the government subsidies it enjoyed. The company filed a lawsuit to contest the tax but was unsuccessful. South Korea’s new pro-crypto stance This policy amendment is in line with several pro-crypto initiatives launched by the government under South Korea’s new president, Lee Jae-myung . Since being sworn into office last month, Lee has pledged to support cryptocurrency assets backed by the South Korean Won and allow the nation’s pension fund to invest up to $884 billion in cryptocurrency. In addition, Lee is working towards lifting the ban on crypto-backed exchange-traded funds. His administration hopes to allow trading for spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETFs by the second half of this year.

With this, the top 10 tokens like Ethereum, XRP, Solana, Tron, Dogecoin and Cardano, hold above their respective support. Meanwhile, Cronos price spiked heavily due to the external factors, while the other tokens attracted notable gains. Therefore, the current crypto markets appear to be largely stable, with the market capitalisation and volume remaining within a range. Although the BTC price is an inch close to its ATH, the market sentiments continue to remain neutral, while the star token continues to hold a huge dominance. Besides, Cronos (CRO) and Raydium (RAY) attract double-digit gains, followed by popular memecoins. Meanwhile, the other tokens attract decent gains, hinting towards the markets experiencing a stabilized state. Cronos Settles After A Massive Breakout The CRO price experienced a pullback of nearly 5% after rising by more than 22% following the inclusion in the Truth Social Blue-Chip ETF filing . The token not only broke above the multi-month consolidated zone but also attracted volume that surged from levels around $10 million to as high as $230 million within a few hours. The long-term price action appears bearish as the sellers have booked the profit, but the short-term price action hints towards a drop in their actions as well. The CRO price is trying hard to hold the local support at $0.0897, which may offer a strong bullish rebound. The StochRSI has reached the oversold range, while the hourly MACD displays a rise in the selling pressure. However, the chart pattern suggests the support could be held firmly, which may further reinstitute a strong upswing back to the local highs and eventually achieve $0.1. Raydium Preparing for a Parabolic Recovery Raydium is climbing steadily with a significant rise in the buying pressure and is currently trading at $2.42 with a huge rise of over 13% in the past 24 hours. The token broke the $2.3 level with a strong bounce after bouncing from the $2.01 lows. This breakout is backed by a massive rise in the volume and a clean trend. RAY price appears to be undergoing a parabolic recovery that initiated before the start of the month. The latest rise pushed the price above the 50-day MA, which is now serving as a temporary support. A daily close above the levels could validate the rise, but until then, the fear of the pullback may haunt the rally. On the other hand, the RSI is incremental, which hints towards the rising strength of the rally. Therefore, the next levels to look out for are $2.42, followed by $2.56 and $2.7.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/crypto-market-today-top-tokens-stabilise-while-cronos-explodes-with-over-2000-rise-in-volume-followed-by-raydium/,"TRADING|CRO|RAY|MARKET|BTC","Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-07-09T06:08:51,"Memecoin PNUT Rips on Elon Musk’s Epstein Cue","‘Peanut’ the squirrel is dead, but the meme coin named after him is still mooning. A late-night post from technocrat Elon Musk slamming U.S. authorities for euthanizing the viral squirrel while failing to charge anyone from Jeffrey Epstein’s alleged client list preceded a volume and price spike, data shows, showing speculative fervor is alive and well in the market. (The ""Epstein list"" refers to high-profile individuals allegedly connected to Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking network. No official, verified public list exists.) “Government is deeply broken,” Musk wrote. “They arrested (and killed) Peanut, but have not even tried to file charges against anyone on the Epstein client list.” Within minutes, Solana-based meme token PNUT spiked over 10% as traders piled in on the name-drop. PNUT, which has no affiliation with the actual squirrel or Musk, saw trading volumes surge over 120% from $65 million to $214 million in a 24-hour period, according to CoinGecko. The token’s price briefly touched 23 cents before cooling. With no protocol, no utility, and no roadmap, PNUT trades purely on cultural resonance and reflexive speculation. That makes it a favorite for momentum hunters, and a token to watch for when controversial topics do the rounds — at least on Musk’s X.

2025-07-09T06:06:34,"We Asked 4 AIs If XRP Will Hit $10 Before ETH Taps $10K: You Won’t Believe the Split","TL;DR Four of the most utilized AI chatbots speculate on which one of the two largest altcoins will be the first to reach a significant round-numbered target of $10 for XRP and $10,000 for ETH. Although they acknowledged that it was a challenging prediction to make given their speculative nature, all four backed the same horse. Who’s First? Leaving aside the communities behind both cryptocurrencies and their respective ecosystems, this article will focus on what ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and Grok answered when asked the same question: Will XRP hit $10 first, or will ETH reach $10,000 first? Historically, Ether had come closer to its rather tall goal as it surged to almost $5,000 back in 2021. In contrast, XRP’s all-time high was at $3.4 in January 2018, and the asset only managed to match it in 2025. Although ETH is slightly closer to its target now, the difference is negligible as both require rather similar price increases (of around 300%) to reach their respective goals. While this sounds significant, especially for the two largest altcoins, let’s not forget that XRP experienced an even more remarkable price surge in late 2024 and early 2025. All AI solutions admitted that ETH appears as the more likely horse to win this race. They laid out its path toward the $10,000 target, claiming that ecosystem growth, network upgrades, RWA tokenization, and institutional adoption will push it higher. ChatGPT was particularly interested in the institutional adoption segment, indicating that ETH has an advantage not just because of the ETF demand it sees, but also due to the growing number of companies that have recently started storing ether as a reserve asset. Some even dumped BTC to buy more ETH. “Ethereum hitting $10,000 first seems more probable in the medium term. Its established ecosystem, ongoing technological advancements (especially the impact of spot ETFs), and its central role in the broader crypto space (DeFi, NFTs, RWA tokenization) provide a more diverse and robust set of drivers. The percentage increase required for Ethereum is also slightly lower than for XRP to reach $10.” – concluded Gemini but the sentiment was echoed by all other AIs. XRP’s Case Although the AI chatbots seemed conclusive in picking ETH as the potential winner, they also outlined the less probable scenario in which XRP goes into double-digit price territory first. Gemini said that its path is “contingent on regulatory clarity and widespread institutional adoption for cross-border payments.” Grok noted that Ripple’s token can reach $10 if the company behind it continues with its massive partnerships and acquisitions, which could increase the overall trust in the project. Recall that the company spent over $1.2 billion earlier this year to acquire the prime brokerage giant Hidden Road, a move described by the community as a “game-changer” for XRP .

2025-07-09T06:02:54,"Key Market Dynamic Keeps Bitcoin, XRP Anchored to $110K and $2.3 as Ether Looks Prone to Volatility","Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP (XRP) are trading sideways, which is likely being driven by a hidden force that's keeping both cryptocurrencies anchored to key price levels. However, the same ""price magnets"" might add to the ether (ETH) market volatility. We are talking about market makers – entities tasked with creating liquidity in an exchange's order book. These entities are always on the opposite side of traders/investors and make money from the bid-ask spread, while constantly striving to maintain a price-neutral exposure. Their hedging strategies in futures/spot markets often add to or curb volatility in the market. In BTC's case, options market makers are ""long gamma"" at strikes $108,000 and $110,000, according to Deribit-listed options activity tracked by Amberdata. The position indicates that market makers hold long options (calls and puts), which stand to benefit from potential volatility. As such, market makers are likely trading against market movements – selling high and buying low – to maintain the direction-neutral book, effectively keeping BTC pinned in the $108,000-$110,000 range. BTC's price has mostly traded the said range this month, according to CoinDesk data. A similar dynamic seems to be playing out in the XRP market, where a large positive market maker gamma build up is observed at the $2.30 strike price. That calls for maker makers to buy low and sell high around that level capping volatility. Ether prone to volatility Ethereum's native token ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, hit a high of $2,647 early today, the level last seen on June 16. The move has pushed ether into a ""negative market maker gamma"" zone of $2,650-$3,500. When dealers hold negative gamma, they tend to trade in the direction of the market, exacerbating bullish/bearish moves. In other words, their hedging activities could add to ether's bullish momentum, exacerbating volatility, assuming other things being equal.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/09/key-market-dynamic-keeps-bitcoin-xrp-anchored-to-usd110k-and-usd2-3-as-ether-looks-prone-to-volatility,"MARKET|BTC|XRP|TRADING|ETH","Markets|XRP|Bitcoin|Ether|Markets|Options|News",cryptocompare

According to Peterson, the period he calls the “Bitcoin Bastille Day Rally” will begin on July 14, which the analyst believes could herald a significant recovery phase for Bitcoin. Peterson, in his analysis based on historical data, noted that in years where Bitcoin underperforms, it typically experiences a strong rally starting around Bastille Day. He explained that this rally typically begins on July 14th and lasts until July 30th, noting that this two-week period is a critical time for Bitcoin to recoup its losses from the year. Related News: The Country Where Tether (USDT) Is Keeping Tons of Its Gold Has Been Revealed - Here Are the Details However, this rise also comes with a warning for investors: According to Peterson, the ten-week period following this two-week recovery period stands out as one of the weakest performing periods for Bitcoin historically. Peterson also noted that Bitcoin behaves like a “compressed spring,” arguing that historically, Bitcoin has seen an average rise of at least 16% in positive months. However, this year, this figure has only been 9% so far. This suggests that strong moves above 16% are possible in the coming positive months, according to the analyst. *This is not investment advice.

Price prediction for 2025 suggests a potential high of $32. Long-term forecasts indicate LINK could reach $195 by 2030. Chainlink has emerged as a game-changing decentralized oracle network, enabling smart contracts to connect seamlessly with real-world data, APIs, and traditional financial systems. As the crypto market evolves, Chainlink’s role continues to expand—especially with its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) gaining traction. Its native token, LINK, not only powers the ecosystem but has also caught the attention of investors and analysts. With LINK price showing signs of a potential breakout and strong on-chain fundamentals backing its rise, the big question remains: Can LINK coin price hit $50 in 2025? Let’s dive into this detailed Chainlink price prediction 2025–2030 to find out. Table of Contents Overview Chainlink Price Target July 2025 LINK Price Prediction 2025 Chainlink Price Targets 2026 – 2030 Market Analysis CoinPedia’s Chainlink Price Prediction FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency Chainlink Token LINK Price $ 14.07790680 5.55% Market Cap $ 9,546,228,185.9079 Trading Volume $ 363,373,234.3995 Circulating Supply 678,099,970.4528 All-time High $52.88 May 10, 2021 All-time Low $0.1263 Sep 23, 2017 Chainlink Price Target July 2025 In July 2025, Chainlink (LINK) is trying to reverse the decline from mid-May caused by a change in geopolitical factors. The end of June showed bullish reawakening in the short term as LINK price seeks a retest of the $18 neckline. This retest is essential for sustaining its upward momentum. The price is currently trying to stabilize around the $13 mark, and a successful break above the $18 level could signal a bullish trend. But if $13 breaks, then it might pull back to $10. LINK Price Prediction 2025 In 2025, Chainlink (LINK) started the year on a downward path, but by April, the tide began to turn. Early in the month, LINK began its recovery from a low of $10.067. By May, it had formed a bullish rounded bottom pattern, with a crucial neckline set at $18. However, since mid-May, LINK has faced challenges in maintaining its position near this neckline. By the third week of June, it pulled back toward the support level of the rounded bottom, which coincides with a multi-year support zone around $11. In the final week of June, LINK’s price began to rise again, but in past 15-days it is attempting to hold steady near the key $13 mark. If bullish momentum continues, LINK could aim to retest the neckline at $18 in July. For this price advance to sustain itself in the long term, LINK must break above and close daily above the $18 neckline. Such a move could signal a potential upward trend, increasing the chances of retesting the $24 resistance level in Q3 and Q4. This area is supported by a high-volume profile from earlier in the year. If LINK manages to surpass the $24 mark, projections for late 2025 suggest that the token could soar as high as $32.

In 2025, Ripple re-locked 700 million XRP each month, except June (670M), compared to 800M monthly from April to October 2024. This suggests Ripple is retaining an additional 100M XRP monthly. If the company continues using only 300M XRP monthly, the escrow could last 10 more years. But increasing usage to 400M XRP by 2026 would reduce that to 7.5 years. A steeper increase could shorten it to six. Analysts warn that if re-locking stops, the XRP supply could deplete even faster. July 9, 2025 05:48:17 UTC Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse Testimony Puts XRP in U.S. Senate Spotlight Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse is set to testify before the U.S. Senate on July 9, shifting from legal battles to leading policy discussions. His testimony emphasizes that XRP is not a security, Ripple holds over 60 global licenses, and U.S. crypto policy is forcing innovation offshore. With the hearing titled “From Wall Street to Web3,” Garlinghouse urges Congress to act, stating, “Money should move like information and XRP is the key.” This marks a major turning point for Ripple, placing XRP at the center of crypto legislation debates. July 9, 2025 05:39:39 UTC XRP Price Could Soar if SEC Ends Ripple Case This Saturday Speculation is mounting that the SEC could announce the end of its case against Ripple this Saturday. If that happens, analysts believe it could signal a coordinated shift, including Fedwire adopting Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) alongside ISO20022 standards. Such a move would align the U.S. financial infrastructure with blockchain-based systems, potentially positioning XRP at the core. Market watchers say this could lead to a massive price breakout for XRP, driven by utility, clarity, and institutional confidence. If true, XRP may soon reach levels the market hasn’t yet imagined.

The move could legitimize XRP on Wall Street, offering institutional access and reshaping its narrative.

2025-07-09T05:30:08,"2% Of All XRP Is In His Hands — But Who Is He?","A long‑time figure in the world of digital money and a noted XRP advocate stepped out of the shadows this week, sparking fresh chatter among investors and developers alike. Related Reading: XRP Could Hit $35 If It Captures A Quarter Of Remittance Market By 2029 Arthur Britto, who co‑founded Ripple Labs in 2012, broke a 14‑year silence with a single emoji on X. That tiny message carried big weight. His name rarely surfaces in headlines, but his work helped build XRP into one of the top assets by market value. Impact Of A Secretive Founder According to reports, Britto kept a low profile while helping craft the XRP Ledger’s code. He holds a 2% stake in XRP under a deal made when the company launched. That slice of holdings could be worth billions if the token’s price ever climbed high enough. Some in the market worry that if Britto ever sold even part of that stake, it might send prices tumbling. 🚨⚠️ HE CO-CREATED THE XRP LEDGER. HE HOLDS 2% OF ALL XRP. HE’S NEVER BEEN SEEN IN PUBLIC. Arthur Britto might be the most important figure in crypto you’ve never heard of. Let’s dive into the mystery.🧵👇 pic.twitter.com/xKyiYXIpGY — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) July 5, 2025 The Satoshi Connection Based on reports, comparisons to Bitcoin’s creator have swirled around Britto for years. Some fans point to the fact that Satoshi Nakamoto’s last known post came just as the XRP Ledger went live. That timing alone has led people to whisper that Britto could be Satoshi under a different name. No proof supports that idea. Experts say it’s more likely just a coincidence. Britto’s lone emoji on X was verified by Ripple CTO David Schwartz. That confirmation set off a wave of theories about what might come next. Some speculated a new protocol update. Others thought it hinted at a partnership or a fresh product launch. So far, nothing public has followed the post. Behind The Scenes At PolySign While he stayed away from interviews, Britto never stopped working. He co‑founded PolySign, a crypto custody firm that now operates under Ripple Custody. That arm provides secure storage for institutions holding digital coins. Based on filings, PolySign handled an estimated $1.5 billion in assets last year. Its integration into Ripple’s services shows Britto’s influence lives on, even if his name doesn’t show up on conference schedules.

2025-07-09T05:30:00,"NEW Remixpoint CEO to Be Paid in Bitcoin","Takashi decided to do this to align with shareholders and the firm’s pivot toward a Bitcoin-focused treasury strategy. Remixpoint already holds an impressive digital asset portfolio, including over 1,051 BTC. Meanwhile, Japanese firm Metaplanet intensified its Bitcoin accumulation, and now holds 15,555 BTC with plans to reach 1% of all Bitcoin in existence by 2027. CEO Simon Gerovich envisions using BTC as collateral to fund acquisitions like a digital bank. At the same time, VC firm Ego Death Capital raised $100 million to back Bitcoin-only startups. Takashi Tashiro Accepts Bitcoin Salary Takashi Tashiro, the newly appointed CEO of Tokyo-based energy firm Remixpoint, will receive his salary in Bitcoin, according to a company statement that was released on Tuesday. The company explained that the move aligns with its goal of “shareholder-oriented management” and reflects Tashiro’s commitment to being “in the same boat” as shareholders. Remixpoint said the payment will be calculated in Japanese yen, and once taxes and remuneration are finalized, the equivalent amount in Bitcoin will be purchased and sent to a crypto wallet designated by Tashiro. Statement from Remixpoint Tashiro stepped into the CEO role in June, and stated that Bitcoin will be central to the company’s financial strategy as it pivots toward a treasury management focus. Even before his appointment, Remixpoint was accumulating a large digital asset portfolio. As of June 13, the company held more than 1,051 BTC, 901 ETH, 13,920 SOL, over 1.19 million XRP, and nearly 2.8 million DOGE, with a total market value exceeding $116 million. Takashi Tashiro In addition to leading Remixpoint, Tashiro is also affiliated with BITPoint, a crypto exchange tied to the SBI Group. The exchange recently attracted some attention for promoting the Trump-themed meme coin “Official Trump.” Remixpoint is not the first company to compensate its executives in cryptocurrency. In 2021, Argo Blockchain’s then-CEO Peter Wall opted to receive his salary in Bitcoin after being inspired by NFL player Russell Okung, who converted a portion of his income to crypto in 2020. Similarly, New York City Mayor Eric Adams accepted his first three paychecks in Bitcoin after his 2021 election campaign. Adams frequently boasted about the growth of his crypto holdings, especially since Bitcoin’s price has more than doubled since he first decided to embrace it. Metaplanet Plans Bitcoin-Backed Expansion Another Japanese firm is also grabbing the attention of the crypto space. Metaplanet is continuing its bold strategy of accumulating Bitcoin with the intention of using it as a financial asset to acquire revenue-generating businesses, including the potential purchase of a digital bank in Japan. In an interview with the Financial Times, CEO Simon Gerovich revealed that the company’s long-term vision is to transform its Bitcoin reserves into leverage for future expansion. He described the firm’s strategy as a “Bitcoin gold rush,” due to the urgency to accumulate as much BTC as possible before others can catch up. Gerovich is very confident that once Metaplanet reaches a critical mass of Bitcoin holdings, it will become increasingly difficult for competitors to rival its position. Metaplanet began buying Bitcoin in 2024 as a hedge against inflation. Since then, it has dramatically shifted its business model and now holds 15,555 BTC. The company plans to increase this number to over 210,000 BTC by 2027, which would amount to 1% of all Bitcoin that will ever exist. Gerovich said that once Metaplanet reaches sufficient holdings, it will begin using Bitcoin as collateral to access financing. He even compared it to how companies use traditional securities or government bonds. The plan is to convert this financial flexibility into acquisitions of cash-generating assets, with a strong preference for businesses aligned with its digital-first vision. One of the main targets under consideration is a digital bank in Japan, which would allow Metaplanet to provide next-generation financial services better than current retail offerings. Although crypto-backed lending is still rare in conventional finance, institutional players are slowly entering the space. Standard Chartered and OKX recently piloted a program for institutional crypto collateral. Gerovich stated that Metaplanet will not pursue convertible debt to fund its acquisitions but would consider issuing preferred shares to avoid repayment obligations tied to volatile share prices. On Monday, the company resumed its aggressive buying spree by adding 2,204 BTC for $237 million at an average price of about $107,700 per coin. This raised its total holdings to 15,555 BTC , with an average purchase cost of $99,985 per Bitcoin. Despite limited revenue, Metaplanet’s stock soared more than 330% in 2025, pushing its market capitalization beyond $7 billion. The company’s approach is very similar to that of MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, which now holds over 597,000 BTC and has a market cap of $112 billion. Top public Bitcoin treasury companies (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET ) VC Firm Backs Bitcoin-Only Startups Meanwhile, venture capital firm Ego Death Capital secured $100 million in funding from family offices and other investors to support early-stage Bitcoin companies. The firm plans to allocate the funds to Series A rounds for startups generating between $1 million and $3 million in annual revenue, according to founding partner Nico Leshuga. Speaking to Axios , Leshuga shared his strong conviction in Bitcoin’s role as a foundational technology, and described it as “the only decentralized and secure base to be able to build on.” Ego Death Capital’s strategic focus comes during a wave of institutional enthusiasm for Bitcoin, fueled by the strong performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States and the growth of corporate Bitcoin treasuries. The firm already invested in several Bitcoin-native startups, including Roxcom, a Bitcoin exchange; Relai, a savings platform; and Breez, a payment app built on Bitcoin’s Lightning Network. However, the firm drew a firm line on the scope of its investments. It does not plan to back hardware-oriented companies like miners or wallet manufacturers, nor is it interested in any projects involving other cryptocurrencies. This narrow focus distinguishes Ego Death Capital from other crypto venture firms. The timing of Ego Death’s new fund coincides with a rebound in venture capital funding in the crypto and blockchain space. According to CryptoRank , the second quarter saw a sharp uptick in funding, with a total of $10.03 billion raised. Over half of that, $5.14 billion, came in June alone. Among the standout deals were Vivek Ramaswamy’s $750 million Strive fundraise and the launch of 21 Capital, which raised $585 million for Bitcoin acquisitions. (Source: CryptoRank ) This resurgence was the strongest quarter for crypto venture capital since the first quarter of 2022, when investment levels reached $16.64 billion. Ego Death Capital’s focused strategy in this specific growing landscape means that it has a deepening belief that Bitcoin is not just a store of value, but a foundational platform for the next wave of innovation.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9855/new-remixpoint-ceo-to-be-paid-in-bitcoin,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

These massive daily releases are creating significant sell pressure in the market. As more tokens flood into circulation, volatility is expected to rise. Pioneers should stay alert and closely monitor price movements. July 7, 2025 12:21:59 UTC Is Pi Network at Risk of a Decline? Pi Network is hovering around $0.477, but storm clouds may be forming. With over 300 million tokens set to unlock next month, sell pressure could spike. If Pi fails to hold the $0.477 level, it risks dropping back to its previous bottom near $0.40. Investors should watch this key support zone closely. July 7, 2025 12:19:36 UTC Pi Network Price in India The current Pi Network (PI) price on July 7, 2025, is around ₹39.82–₹41.07 per coin. The 24-hour trading volume is approximately $80–92 million, showing strong interest and liquidity. PI’s market cap stands near $3.5 billion. The coin saw a 4% price rise today, but remains volatile. July 7, 2025 12:08:21 UTC Pi Ecosystem Expands Rapidly with Over 10,000 Apps The Pi Network ecosystem is witnessing rapid growth, with the number of applications reaching 10,580 as of July 7. This surge highlights increasing developer interest and user adoption. Meanwhile, global banks and financial institutions are accelerating their integration into the Pi ecosystem. With its expanding Web3 infrastructure, Pi is steadily positioning itself as a global decentralized network. July 7, 2025 12:08:21 UTC Pi Network Price Faces Critical Phase Pi Network may be entering its most dangerous phase yet. Despite bullish news like AI partnerships and new apps, $Pi’s price remains stagnant. A massive 276 million token unlock this July could trigger $127M in sell pressure. The core team’s silence, stalled KYC, and falling on-chain activity are alarming. With top influencers quiet and community engagement dropping, trust is fading fast. While Bitcoin and Ethereum soar, Pi continues to lag. These aren’t just slowdowns they may signal a deeper crisis. Pioneers should prepare wisely and not rely on blind faith as pressure builds. July 7, 2025 12:08:21 UTC Pi Network Event in India The Pi Network GCV $314,159 event is happening on July 27, 2025, in Tinsukia, Assam, hosted by the PI GCV Warriors of Assam.

2025-07-09T05:13:06,"Ethereum Is Becoming What Treasuries Are to Traditional Finance: Research","“Stablecoins are spreading the dollar faster than any financial tech in history,” said Electric Capital General Partner Maria Shen on Tuesday. “Ethereum is becoming the financial backbone,” she added, referencing a newly published research report on stablecoin demand for Ethereum’s tenth birthday. For the first time, anyone across the globe can hold US dollars via stablecoins, which will drive demand, in turn benefiting Ethereum. The Primary Settlement Layer Despite talk of “de-dollarization,” the global demand for US dollars is booming, especially via stablecoins , which now exceed $260 billion in total market capitalization. This is unlocking dollar access for billions, especially in emerging markets. More than four billion people and millions of businesses are actively seeking dollar access through stablecoins, the researchers noted. Stablecoins are spreading the dollar faster than any financial tech in history. And Ethereum is becoming the financial backbone. For Ethereum’s 10th birthday, we’re publishing our updated @ElectricCapital ETH thesis: Remaking the Case for ETH 1/ pic.twitter.com/Rr9mSrK0GS — mariaa.eth (@MariaShen) July 8, 2025 However, this burgeoning market of new dollar holders wants more than just digital cash. They need yields , investment opportunities, and financial services, and traditional finance, such as banks, cannot serve this massive new market due to regulatory, financial, geofencing, and infrastructure constraints. “Ethereum is uniquely positioned to host the global financial infrastructure for this new digital dollar economy, and ETH stands to benefit directly from this growth.” Ethereum is already primed for this position because it is globally accessible, institution-grade secure, and resistant to government interference. Additionally, Ethereum is already the primary settlement layer, underpinning the largest on-chain economy with more than $140 billion in stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets and $60 billion in DeFi. As a result, Ethereum will become to the on-chain dollar economy what Treasuries and gold are to traditional finance – a reserve and trust anchor. As stablecoin usage expands, a flywheel effect will be generated as more ETH is needed as collateral for DeFi and real-world finance, more ETH is staked, securing the network and reducing supply, and more institutional capital flows in , as the asset offers regulatory clarity and composability. No Real Competition There is no real competition at the moment because Bitcoin lacks programmability and adoption as a financial platform, and other blockchains lack Ethereum’s security, decentralization, and institutional credibility, they said. Additionally, traditional finance is geographically and regulatorily siloed and unable to serve the global demand unlocked by stablecoins. Anyone who has tried to open a bank account in a particular country without a physical address there would concur. “We’ve believed in programmable money since 2018. We made the institutional case for Bitcoin at our founding. Now we’re doing the same for Ethereum,” said Shen in conclusion.

2025-07-09T05:12:07,"Bitcoin Price at a Critical Turning Point: Analysis Company Shares Its Predictions","In its latest report evaluating the technical outlook of Bitcoin (BTC), cryptocurrency analysis firm MakroVision stated that the largest cryptocurrency has reached a critical threshold. While the analysis noted that Bitcoin has formed a strong structure in recent weeks, it was claimed that a breakout in the short term could determine the direction. According to MakroVision’s technical analysis, Bitcoin price is currently approaching the red trend line that has been acting as a strong resistance for weeks. Above this level, there is a high amount of liquidity in the $111,000–$112,000 range. Related News: The Hidden Danger in the Cryptocurrency World: Could This be the Second Terra (LUNA) Incident? On the support side, two main areas stand out: The $106,400–$107,400 range is being watched as short-term support. The $105,000–$102,000 band below this level is defined as a larger demand zone. MakroVision states that if Bitcoin achieves a permanent break above the $110,000 level, a new upward momentum may begin. However, in case of a rejection from this level, the reaction of the price and whether the support zones can be maintained will be decisive in terms of the direction of the market. *This is not investment advice.

Why Does the M2 to Bitcoin Ratio Matter? What Could This Mean for Investors? FAQs Introduction In its June 2025 Bitcoin Monthly Report , global asset manager ARK Invest has revealed a striking milestone for Bitcoin’s scarcity narrative. The ratio of global M2 money supply to Bitcoin supply has reached its highest point in 12 years — highlighting how Bitcoin’s fixed supply continues to contrast with expanding global liquidity. What Did ARK Invest Reveal? According to ARK Invest’s official report ( source ), each Bitcoin now represents about $5.7 million of global M2 money supply . This is the highest ratio seen since Bitcoin’s early years. Key details from the report: Record Ratio: The global M2 supply is growing, while Bitcoin’s issuance rate keeps dropping due to its halving cycle. Future Outlook: ARK expects this ratio to keep climbing as Bitcoin’s supply growth shrinks further. Scarcity Signal: With less new Bitcoin entering circulation, its role as a hedge against fiat currency dilution strengthens. Why Does the M2 to Bitcoin Ratio Matter? Many investors track the M2-to-Bitcoin ratio to understand Bitcoin’s relative scarcity against global liquidity: M2 Supply: Represents cash, checking deposits, and easily convertible near-money — a core measure of global money supply. Bitcoin’s Cap: Unlike fiat currencies, Bitcoin’s total supply is capped at 21 million coins , with the last Bitcoin expected to be mined around 2140. Implication: Rising M2 + fixed Bitcoin = each Bitcoin theoretically absorbs more global liquidity over time. As Cathie Wood , CEO of ARK Invest, has often stated, Bitcoin could act as a hedge against monetary debasement when central banks expand liquidity ( source ). What Could This Mean for Investors? Here are three takeaways for Bitcoin investors and analysts: Potential Store of Value: A higher M2 ratio supports the thesis that Bitcoin’s scarcity could protect wealth long-term. Macro Hedge: Some view Bitcoin as an alternative to gold when fiat supply expands aggressively. Caution Required: Volatility remains — investors should balance enthusiasm with prudent risk management. For related trends, see [Link to related internal page]. FAQs Q1: Who is ARK Invest? ARK Invest is a global investment firm founded by Cathie Wood, known for its focus on disruptive innovation and in-depth research reports. Q2: What is the M2 money supply? M2 includes physical cash, checking accounts, and easily liquid assets — it’s a standard measure of how much money circulates in an economy. Q3: How does Bitcoin’s supply limit work? Bitcoin’s supply is hard-coded to a maximum of 21 million coins. New coins are released through mining rewards, which halve approximately every four years.

2025-07-09T04:30:56,"Bitcoin Absorbs Strong Selling Pressure On Binance Derivatives – Breakout Ahead?","Bitcoin (BTC) has remained range-bound between $100,000 and $110,000 since May 7, aside from a few dips to as low as $98,000 in June, which were quickly followed by daily candle closes above the $100,000 level. Recent analysis reveals that BTC has withstood sustained selling pressure on Binance Derivatives throughout this period. Bitcoin Withstands Binance Derivatives Sell-Off According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor BorisVest, taker users on Binance Derivatives have consistently engaged in sell-side activity for at least the past 45 days. Notably, the Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) has remained negative throughout this time. For the uninitiated, the CVD measures the net difference between market buy – aggressive buying – and market sell – aggressive selling – orders over time. It helps traders identify whether buying or selling pressure is dominating, even if price remains stable. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Floor Rises Toward $100,000, Reinforcing Bullish Sentiment BorisVest noted that Binance Derivatives traders are treating each BTC bounce or rally as a selling opportunity, opening aggressive short positions via market sell orders. However, this strong sell pressure has failed to push prices lower, as BTC continues to absorb the selling activity and maintain support above $100,000. The analyst added that as long as BTC remains within its current range – between $100,000 and $110,000 – while absorbing sell pressure, the potential for upside remains intact. He explained: The CVD metric plays a crucial role here. It aggregates both taker and maker activity to provide a real-time picture of net buy/sell pressure. The fact that CVD remains in decline confirms the dominance of sell-side flow. Yet, the inability of price to drop further despite this pressure may signal that Bitcoin is being absorbed by institutional or large players in the background. That said, other analysts interpret the persistent selling pressure differently. For example, fellow CryptoQuant analyst Crazzyblockk recently observed that new buyer demand is struggling to keep pace with the combined supply pressure from newly mined BTC and selling by long-term holders. BTC Eyeing A Breakout Ahead? Bitcoin’s resilience in the face of heavy selling on Binance Derivatives has once again sparked speculation about a potential breakout. Several additional data points suggest that BTC may be poised to move into a higher price range soon. Related Reading: Bitcoin Forming Inverse Head And Shoulders Pattern – Is $150,000 The Next Target? For instance, recent on-chain data shows that “weak hands” are offloading their BTC holdings to larger, more established investors – indicating a broader shift in sentiment favoring Bitcoin. Meanwhile, institutional interest in the asset continues to grow. Additionally, the Bitcoin Yearly Percentage Trend suggests that BTC could top out around $205,000 by the end of 2025. At press time, BTC trades at $108,589, up 0.4% in the past 24 hours.

2025-07-09T04:29:30,"Elon Musk’s post criticizing the justice system drew attention to Solana’s PNUT token","Billionaire Elon Musk’s X post drew attention to Solana’s Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) token, which has so far climbed more than 10% in price in just 24 hours. In his Tuesday post, Musk bashed the government for failing to take action against people on the Epstein client list , including a meme mocking the justice system. The meme insinuated that more squirrels and raccoons than Epstein’s affiliates have been apprehended. Crypto traders tied Musk’s post to Solana’s PNUT token Musk also mentioned a squirrel named Peanut, who was “arrested (and killed), in his post. While he didn’t name the PNUT token explicitly, the timing of his post coincided with a spike in the coin’s price and trading activity. Source: CoinMarketCap He wrote, “They arrested (and killed) Peanut but have not even tried to file charges against anyone on the Epstein client list. Government is deeply broken.” So far, the post has over 13.7 million views, earning nearly 45% of the views in just a few hours. Crypto investors seem to have associated his post with the Solana meme coin. After his post, the PNUT token surged 10% to $0.2357. The asset’s 24-hour trading volume also grew 80%, crossing $214 million. Currently, the meme coin has a market cap of $223 million, trading at $0.2257. Musk’s past posts have fueled crypto price rallies This is not the first time Musk’s posts have driven price rallies for crypto assets. In January, he changed his handle on X to “Kekius Maximus” and profile picture to show “Pepe the Frog” in Roman military attire, holding a video game joystick. After his alteration, the Kekius Maximus token surged over 900% . In 2021, Musk wrote, “The Dogefather SNL May 8” in one of his posts, and Dogecoin, a popular meme coin, rose over 20% in 24 hours. Then again, in 2024, he posted an AI image related to the token, causing another price rise for the token by about 8%. Additionally, in January 2021, he changed his bio on the platform to #bitcoin. Soon after, Bitcoin’s price jumped from roughly $32,000 to more than $38,000, adding $111 billion to its market cap. Moreover, the Ethereum-based meme coin Floki rose 418% after the billionaire posted a picture of his dog named Floki in 2023. Judging from history, Musk’s meme and crypto-related posts, no matter how subtle, tend to spark swift reactions in the crypto market. In this case, a satirical political reference propelled a Solana meme token upward, but whether the token can grow more hinges on future hype and traction. Musk is hoping to establish a new political party Meanwhile, the billionaire is focused on building a third party that could rival the Republican and Democratic parties. Following his fallout with President Trump over the ‘Big Beautiful Bill,’ Musk disclosed the birth of the American Party. He’s touted the new party as tech-driven, fiscally responsible, energy-friendly, and politically centrist, aiming to attract both Democrats and Republicans alike. However, experts have warned that disbanding the grip of the traditional parties demands significant funding and long-term dedication. They noted how previous attempts failed, especially since elections in the country are at a state-by-state level. However, some are optimistic that Musk could pull through with his new party, including David Jolly, a former Republican congressman from Florida. Jolly believes the challenge in forming a new party is having resources, noting that Musk could provide that. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

The proposed investment trust will primarily hold Bitcoin (BTC) , Ethereum (ETH) , Solana (SOL) , Ripple (XRP) , and Cronos (CRO) , the native token of the Cronos blockchain, which is associated with the Crypto.com exchange. The SEC has acknowledged the filing, which means it’s now under review, according to a July 8 SEC submission. Source: Sec.gov Truth Social ETF Portfolio Structure and Crypto.com partnership The ETF portfolio will maintain a composition of approximately 70% Bitcoin , 15% Ethereum , 8% Solana , 5% Cronos , and 2% XRP by value. Upon approval, the ETF will be listed and traded on NYSE Arca, though the fund’s ticker symbol remains undisclosed. ""the Trust’s allocation of its assets to the Portfolio Assets (the “allocation ratio”) is initially expected to approximate percentages by value of 70% bitcoin, 15% ether, 8% SOL, 5% CRO and 2% XRP."" — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 8, 2025 The proposed ETF is expected to function as a passive investment vehicle, tracking the market prices of its underlying cryptocurrencies without employing leverage, derivatives, or speculative trading strategies. The fund will also engage in staking for assets such as Ethereum, Solana, and Cronos, allowing it to generate staking rewards. Truth Social previously filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF in June, followed by a submission for a Bitcoin and Ethereum combination ETF. Similar to those registration statements, the “Truth Social Crypto Blue Chip ETF” is sponsored by Yorkville America Digital, while Foris DAX Trust Company will be serving as custodian for digital assets, according to the filing. Additionally, Crypto.com will act as the ETF’s exclusive Bitcoin custodian, prime execution agent, and liquidity provider. Earlier reports indicated a TMTG partnership with Singapore-based Crypto.com to launch “Made-in-America” ETFs. The media platform signed a non-binding agreement to offer a series of exchange-traded products (ETPs) and funds (ETFs) on the Cronos blockchain-owned exchange. The inclusion of CRO in the investable ETFs appears to confirm Crypto.com’s involvement in the venture. Notably, the news of the recent filing had a notably greater impact on CRO than on other Truth Social blue-chip cryptocurrencies. The asset surged more than 20% to a monthly high of $0.09886, while Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Solana only experienced gains between 1.08% and 3.6% during the same period. Source: Coingecko TMTG’s Broader Digital Asset Strategy Amid President Trump’s Growing Crypto Fortune The SEC’s potential approval follows the confirmation by Truth Social’s parent company of its digital asset strategy, which includes a Bitcoin treasury plan. On May 30, the company announced it had raised $2.44 billion through a private placement involving nearly 50 institutional investors. The SEC has approved Trump Media and Technology Group’s (TMTG) registration statement linked to a $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury initiative. #Trump #TruthSocial https://t.co/ybidUAZtqb — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 14, 2025 The funding round included 55.9 million shares at $25.72 and $1 billion in zero-coupon convertible notes, with proceeds designated for Bitcoin acquisition and general operations. In a May 27 announcement, TMTG President and CEO Devin Nunes described Bitcoin as “an apex instrument of financial freedom,” stating that it would become a core component of the company’s asset base. On the same day, Arkham Intelligence posted on X: “Donald Trump’s company, Trump Media, will buy $2.5 BILLION of Bitcoin. Is Trump about to go Saylor Mode?”, referencing MicroStrategy’s executive chairman and his aggressive Bitcoin strategy. Moreover, President Trump appears to be benefiting significantly from these cryptocurrency ventures. A July 2 Bloomberg report revealed that Trump and his family have reportedly earned over $620 million from recent cryptocurrency ventures, with Trump’s exclusive crypto holdings now comprising around 9% of his estimated $6 billion fortune as of June.

2025-07-09T04:08:07,"XRP Price Regains Traction — Is a Powerful Upside Break Brewing?","XRP price started a fresh increase above the $2.30 zone. The price is now showing positive signs and might climb above the $2.32 resistance. XRP price started a fresh increase above the $2.280 zone. The price is now trading above $2.280 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2.280 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it stays above the $2.250 zone. XRP Price Eyes Fresh Increase XRP price started a fresh increase after it settled above the $2.2620 level, beating Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price was able to climb above the $2.280 resistance level. The recent move was positive and the bulls pushed the price above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.353 swing high to the $2.251 low, and tested the $2.32 zone. Besides, there is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2.280 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading above $2.280 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.320 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.330 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.353 swing high to the $2.251 low. A clear move above the $2.330 resistance might send the price toward the $2.350 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.40 resistance or even $2.420 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near the $2.50 zone. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.320 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.280 level and the trend line zone. The next major support is near the $2.250 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.250 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.220 support. The next major support sits near the $2.20 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $2.280 and $2.250. Major Resistance Levels – $2.330 and $2.350.",newsbtc,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-regains-traction-2-32/,"TRADING|XRP|BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE","XRP|Ripple|XRPBTC|XRPUSD|xrpusdt",cryptocompare
